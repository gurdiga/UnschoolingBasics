He also doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwish to leave the house very often.<br/>\nOne thing I found is it&#39;s okay to talk with him about my feelings and <br/>\nthoughts and it leads to him talking more also about his. This is new <br/>\nto both of us.<br/>\nThanks for the suggestions and encouragement from all, as I&#39;ve been <br/>\na &quot;lurker&quot; for some time.

Or, if the tool didn&#39;t exist, perhaps<br/>\nthis woodworker would say &quot;this seems like it should exist&quot; and figure out<br/>\nhow to create such a tool- again, using a variety of resources that are at<br/>\nthe disposal of anyone who cares to look for them.   As unschooling parents<br/>\nits our job to let our kids explore and provide support when its needed- so<br/>\nif the woodworker were a child, the parent would be responsible for saying<br/>\n&quot;wow, that looks difficult, do you want some help looking for a way that is<br/>\nless frustrating?&quot; or just doing some research and finding out for them,<br/>\nthen offering the information. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is never too late to find the tools you need to do something you want to<br/>\ndo.  But you need to take personal responsibility for your learning in order<br/>\nto do it.  If a learner is going to sit and wait for a teacher to hand them<br/>\neverything they need, they very well may not get what they need at all.<br/>\nWhich is what your dh&#39;s piano story illustrates rather vividly.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs Pam said though, young children do tend to learn more through exploration<br/>\nthan through being shown exactly what to do.  It&#39;s a developmental<br/>\ndifference between children and adults (whether young or more mature) .<br/>\nWith my own kids I have noticed that even though they sometimes appear to<br/>\nneed to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;, rejecting suggestions or new information<br/>\ninitially,  their learning has so much more depth than if they had just<br/>\nautomatically adopted new information or taken suggestions.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLesley<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Need some good answers for my husband","postDate":"1203959723","msgId":30243,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZwdXQzYysxbWNuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNjIwMWM4NzczOSQzMWY2YWNiMCQzNTAxYThjMEBsZXNsZXlwYz4="},"prevInTopic":30238,"nextInTopic":30248,"prevInTime":30242,"nextInTime":30244,"topicId":30165,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~ So partly because of this two experiences, he believes that learning through playing around, trial and error, trying stuff on his own, is actually MORE","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-926000245\">~~&quot;So partly because of this two experiences, he believes that<br/>\nlearning through playing around, trial and error, trying stuff on his<br/>\nown, is actually MORE frustrating, LESS efficient, and wastes a lot of<br/>\ntime and energy, than structured, thought-out instruction.&quot;~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a lot easier to blame a teacher (or lack therof) for some<br/>\nperceived failure, rather than look within.

He&#39;s not the kind of person that is<br/>\nin the spotlight, or doing some grand-looking thing or wears some<br/>\nlabel of &quot;success&quot; according to most of the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s thoughtful, intelligent, well-spoken and capable.

He&#39;ll also tell you that<br/>\nunschooling was the best way for him to learn and grow. He&#39;s very<br/>\ngrateful for his free life and I can see the results in a beautiful,<br/>\nbrilliant and strong human being that is quite comfortable in his own<br/>\nskin.

Why did he never look into what it takes to<br/>\nbecome a concert pianist?  When he found out that his instruction hadn&#39;t<br/>\nprepared him, why didn&#39;t he find what he needed?  What is stopping him from<br/>\npursuing that as a career now, or at least continuing to enjoy playing the<br/>\npiano?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNo one is saying &quot;because we&#39;re unschoolers we can&#39;t seek out structured,<br/>\nthought-out instruction&quot;.  As unschoolers, I&#39;d say we&#39;re more equipped to<br/>\nlook for exactly what we want and find it.  Its all about taking back your<br/>\nown power;  getting a second opinion, finding what works for *you* (or our<br/>\nkids finding what works for them, with our help, a role that our parents<br/>\nweren&#39;t prepared to fill but that we can fill for our kids because we have<br/>\nresources like books, email lists, websites, etc.).  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, choosing to seek out structured, thought-out instruction is a<br/>\ncompletely different world from having structured, thought-out instruction<br/>\nimposed upon you.  I would argue that the only people who benefit fully from<br/>\nformal instruction are those who have chosen that instruction freely.   To<br/>\ndevote yourself to something is not the same thing as someone else devoting<br/>\nyou to that activity without your input.    Or even the same as saying &quot;so<br/>\nyou want to be a piano player?  Well, here&#39;s your teacher, do what she says<br/>\nand you&#39;ll learn how.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many different learning styles, and &quot;structured, thought-out<br/>\ninstruction&quot; can take many, many different forms- all of them valid and<br/>\nuseful for different people.   Just because one approach, teacher, or<br/>\nteaching method doesn&#39;t work for a particular learner it is not an<br/>\nindication that the learner is incapable of achieving a higher level of<br/>\nskill, and it also doesn&#39;t prove that the particular approach, teacher, or<br/>\nteaching method is a failure.  It&#39;s just not the right match between the<br/>\nlearner and what they want out of their experience.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks to me that you&#39;re seeing &quot;one right way&quot; thinking.  Your dh is<br/>\nstuck in the place where he thinks there must be one right way to do or<br/>\nlearn things- the BEST way.  The thing is, we live in a world of infinite<br/>\npossibilities.

They eventually come to know that they <br/>\naren&#39;t that good OR they go on to pursue it harder and closer and find <br/>\nbigger and better venues/coaches/opportunities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my questions would be: How come he thought his skills were so <br/>\nhigh? Did someone lead him to believe that? Did he not listen to/watch <br/>\nbig name pianists? Whom was he comparing himself to? What opportunities <br/>\ndid he have to explore piano?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I had the *talent* (as well as the desire) to try out for the <br/>\nOlympics. I felt there were other obstacles. School was one. (Go <br/>\nfigure! &lt;G&gt;) Moving away from home at 16 was another. There was no <br/>\nguarantee that I would have made it, but looking back---it would have <br/>\nbeen nice to go for it. &lt;g&gt; But there were bigger names in the sport <br/>\nwho felt I should have the opportunity. I didn&#39;t &quot;make that up&quot; because <br/>\nI wanted it---*others* in the sport came to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he feels like he wasted a LOT of time and energy, in an area that<br/>\nREALLY interested him, because he didn&#39;t have somebody knowledgable<br/>\nguide him.

It shaped me like nothing else <br/>\n---other than maybe becoming a parent---ever has. Involving myself in a <br/>\npassion---any passion---has been important in becoming Who I Am.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso---I didn&#39;t take one person&#39;s word for anything. I looked for <br/>\ndifferent trainers. In fact, at one point, I had a different coach for <br/>\neach day of the week! &lt;G&gt; They each had a specialty and a different way <br/>\nto approach the same problem, and it was good for me to try different <br/>\ntactics. I used what worked for me and enjoyed the novelty of the <br/>\ndifferent trainers and their abilities. ANd I worked HARD for each of <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve encouraged both my boys to immerse themselves in their passions <br/>\nwholly and fully. Cameron&#39;s interests in magic, baseball, soccer, <br/>\nskateboarding, film-making, drumming, cooking, and now outdoor <br/>\nleadership/camping/backpacking---not a MINUTE of those passions has <br/>\nbeen wasted. Each as given him a huge sense of Who He Is and what he <br/>\ncan accomplish. He has learned skills and abilities he didn&#39;t know. If <br/>\nhe never plays another game of baseball or never does another magic <br/>\ntrick (and he was GOOD!!!) or makes another film---all those things <br/>\nhave been essential to Who He Is Now. I hope he never thinks of that <br/>\ntime as wasted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also encourage them to meet as many different ways to approach their <br/>\npassions. When Cam was playing drums, he explored the djembe, bamboo <br/>\ndrums, Scottish pipe and drums corps, jazz, blues, and funk. Danny was <br/>\nhis main instructor, but Cameron worked with other bigger names in <br/>\ndrumming when he&#39;d meet them---just asked for an hour of their time. <br/>\nPeople LOVE to share their passions---and when they find a young person <br/>\n(or even an OLD person! &lt;G&gt;) with the same passion, they are THRILLED <br/>\nto share what they know. I mean---*beyond* thrilled!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilar experience for him in computer programmer. He learned on-the-<br/>\njob, and yes, he can do it, but he&#39;s had many periods of banging his<br/>\nhead against a wall and going in circles for a LONG time trying<br/>\nto &quot;connect the dots&quot; in a way that, he claims, wouldn&#39;t have been<br/>\nelusive to him had he gotten his degree in Computer Science and gone<br/>\nthrough all that coursework.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m afraid that almost anything that&#39;s new and worth learning---and <br/>\nespecially something that&#39;s difficult!---requires a lot of <br/>\nhead-banging. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I know several computer programmers who learned without <br/>\ngetting a degree in Computer Science. What about them?<br/>\n<br/>\nDid he never think to *ask* a more knowledgeable person for help?? Or <br/>\ndid he just sit there trying to figure it out for himself?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a LOT to be said for figuring it out by yourself, but <br/>\nsometimes, there&#39;s just no need to reinvent the wheel.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo partly because of this two experiences, he believes that learning<br/>\nthrough playing around, trial and error, trying stuff on his own, is<br/>\nactually MORE frustrating, LESS efficient, and wastes a lot of time<br/>\nand energy, than structured, thought-out instruction.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes. But if so, why didn&#39;t he seek out more help?<br/>\n<br/>\nEach person learns best in his own way. It&#39;s a good idea to know what <br/>\nworks for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like a lot of information but not so much direction. I usually gather <br/>\nas much information on a subject as I can and then work my way through <br/>\nit as best I can. I make mistakes (we call them learning-takes) and <br/>\nlearn from them, and then I fix those mistakes and go on. Sometimes <br/>\nthat&#39;s frustrating, but I can choose to keep doing it or quit.  Other <br/>\npeople prefer more hand-holding. It&#39;s really about what works for *you*.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour husband can&#39;t decide what works for your son. Only your son can <br/>\nmake that decision. But that takes trial and error---to find what works <br/>\nfor each individual. And that may change as we grow and learn and get <br/>\nolder. It helps to be open to what works for us at the time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMore new features than ever.

The time spent &quot;banging&quot; on the keys?  I guess I&#39;ve never<br/>\nthought I&#39;ve wasted my time during a pleasurable pursuit.  I draw, I<br/>\nenjoy it.  I&#39;m not good at it.  I do cartoon stuff.  But it&#39;s not a<br/>\nwaste of my time if it brings me joy.  Can I make a living at it?  No.<br/>\n Not with the skill set I have now, but if I wanted to, I could seek a<br/>\nqualified teacher (and I would know who that was now as an adult but<br/>\nnot as a child) and learn and then attempt to use it as a job, but<br/>\nsomehow I think *having* to do it, for someone else, to their<br/>\nstandards and on a deadline would take the fun out of it.  In fact I<br/>\nknow it would, because I write too...and when I write for the joy of<br/>\nit I do enjoy it.  But when I&#39;m on a deadline and dealing with editors<br/>\nit&#39;s not as much fun.  Anyway, I guess I think your husband didn&#39;t<br/>\nwaste his time because he enjoyed it.  Just because he&#39;s not making a<br/>\nliving at it doesn&#39;t mean he shouldn&#39;t still mess around playing the<br/>\npiano.  We can&#39;t all be superstars in everything but that shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nstop us from enjoying messing around with it.

A lot of guys show up wanting to learn to play guitar, <br/>\nso I help them as best I can to get started, if they want me <br/>\nto.

Right, that whole line of reasoning is<br/>\nfor the birds.<br/>\n<br/>\n****************************************************<br/>\n&quot;I know from my own experience that there are certain<br/>\nthings people are never going to be *very* good at,<br/>\nlike playing an instrument well, or learning how to be<br/>\na good computer programmer, without somebody who is<br/>\nwiser and knows how to lead you through it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sometimes they make take you through some<br/>\nseemingly meaningless things, like playing arpeggios,<br/>\nbut you trust them, because you know they can take you<br/>\nsomewhere you want to get to, and then later you can<br/>\nlook back and see how it did make sense ... like &#39;Wax<br/>\non, wax off&#39; from the Karate Kid. It may not have made<br/>\nsense to him, but he did it because he knew the<br/>\nteacher could help him get somewhere that he couldn&#39;t<br/>\nget on his own.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA:  Again, you can&#39;t teach someone who doesn&#39;t want to be taught.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n******************************************************<br/>\n&quot;Can a child really be wise enough to guide himself?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA:  As long as they&#39;re not told they&#39;re too stupid to do it.  I bought into<br/>\nit, and now I&#39;m a wonderful sheep.  My DW can&#39;t understand how I can just<br/>\ntake someone else&#39;s &quot;word for it.&quot;  I have to work to maintain my own<br/>\nidentity sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nReverse question:<br/>\n     Does wisdom come only through old age?<br/>\nIt is said that the beginning Buddhist student sees only her/himself, the<br/>\ncup and the tea.<br/>\nThe experienced (?) student can see that he and the cup and the tea are one.<br/>\nThe Master sees him/herself, the cup and the tea.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways, I think we spend our lives to re-learn what kids already know.<br/>\n<br/>\n******************************************************<br/>\n&quot;Organic, unplanned, unexpected learning seems great,<br/>\nbut are these people saying that there&#39;s NEVER a place<br/>\nfor focused, structured, incremental learning as well?<br/>\nIt seems like what would maximize learning potential<br/>\nwould be to have the two together.

I&#39;m<br/>\nafraid that after a while she&#39;ll even start to feel<br/>\nlike she&#39;s stupid.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA:  I disagree.  I think what discourages children the most is being told,<br/>\nthrough words, actions, or the overall environment they live in, that they<br/>\ncannot do it and that they must be helped.  Another discouragement is that<br/>\nthey are constantly told that the world is a dangerous place.  Told this<br/>\nenough, they will believe that it is ONLY a dangerous place, and the only<br/>\nSAFE place is to withdraw FROM the world.  Given enough room and enough<br/>\nexperiences that the world is truly exciting and fun, she will challenge<br/>\nherself in the ways that she wants and needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that the &quot;stupid&quot; part comes from comparing with others.  This can<br/>\nbe made worse if the child believes that the world is inherently dangerous<br/>\n(withdraws), or that they cannot &quot;do it&quot; and must be constantly &quot;helped.&quot;<br/>\nAdd comparison to other kids, and they would likely feel GROSSLY<br/>\ninadequate.  I know I did.  NOT comparing is a really tough issue, but it is<br/>\nan important  one to be addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have more to add, but then I always do.

They just  <br/>\ndecide they don&#39;t like the pusher, don&#39;t like what they were being  <br/>\npushed to do, and don&#39;t like being pushed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the larger truth in the above statement is that people remember  <br/>\nthe positive results and forget the negative results. A not very  <br/>\nscientific process!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the long run, it&#39;s better not to learn to depend on an outside  <br/>\nsource to push you past rough spots. It&#39;s far more useful for a  <br/>\nlifetime to learn how to push yourself. Kids get that by having  <br/>\nopportunities to discover that by pushing past rough spots, there are  <br/>\n-- usually! -- rewards and a sense of accomplishment beyond the rough  <br/>\npatches. And a really useful skill is being able to assess along the  <br/>\nway and determine when an activity is draining more than it&#39;s  <br/>\nreturning (or likely to return.) Sometimes we&#39;ll guess wrong. But  <br/>\nthat&#39;s okay. We learn from our mistakes. And when we have the freedom  <br/>\nto drop things and pick them up again, we know we can go back and  <br/>\npick something up when we feel we&#39;re ready for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, people can *choose* to find someone who will push them,  <br/>\nknowing full well that they&#39;re choosing to be pushed and can choose  <br/>\nto drop the pushing any time. (Athletic coaches come to mind.) While  <br/>\nchoosing to have someone push you may look the same from the outside  <br/>\nas someone pushing someone else, it has a totally different feel  <br/>\ninside the person. And since all learning happens inside, what&#39;s  <br/>\nhappening inside the person is more important than what it looks like  <br/>\nfrom outside.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I know from my own experience that there are certain<br/>\n&gt; things people are never going to be *very* good at,<br/>\n&gt; like playing an instrument well, or learning how to be<br/>\n&gt; a good computer programmer, without somebody who is<br/>\n&gt; wiser and knows how to lead you through it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is true. But what we don&#39;t know is what *else* they would have  <br/>\ndone if they had the freedom. We *can&#39;t* know. And because we can&#39;t  <br/>\nknow, it&#39;s scary. If we&#39;re in a place we like, it&#39;s scary to think we  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have gotten there except by being pushed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good to take fears out and examine them! Often they encourage us  <br/>\nto do things to avoid worst case scenarios to make us feel comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t a way around that fear other than face it. To also see  <br/>\nthe benefits of unschooling until that becomes way more important  <br/>\nthan the unfounded fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd unschoolers *do* introduce their kids to a variety of activities.  <br/>\nWhen the kids show an interest in something, we help them find ways  <br/>\nto explore it. If they want, that can be a mentor who knows an  <br/>\ninstrument well or knows programming if that&#39;s where they&#39;re headed.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids *do* let us know what interests them even when it&#39;s  <br/>\noutside of the things we&#39;re showing them. They may not jump directly  <br/>\nto programming but they will be asking questions  about how people  <br/>\nget things to do things. And it grows from there as we find ways to  <br/>\nanswer their questions, and find others to answer their questions  <br/>\nwhen the need more than we can provide.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; and knows how to lead you through it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one of the sticking points to getting unschooling. When we  <br/>\nonly know the success of being led through something, when we see all  <br/>\nthat we needed to know in order to get where we ended up, it seems  <br/>\nimpossible for that to have happened any other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest cure to that is seeing kids who have learned loads about  <br/>\nsomething just by playing, wanting to learn it, and doing it. Kids  <br/>\nlearn HTML, Java and Javascript all by wanting to do stuff with it  <br/>\nwithout a programmed process leading them from one thing to another.  <br/>\nThey just plunge in and learn what they need in the moment. (It&#39;s  <br/>\nexactly how I learned HTML.) While the process is chaotic and pretty  <br/>\nmuch untestable since kids are zigzagging from one bit to another,  <br/>\nreaching for what they need to know in the moment without any  <br/>\napparent plan to get &quot;everything&quot;, the process is exactly the way  <br/>\nthey learn to speak English. And that works *way* better than sitting  <br/>\nin a classroom to supposedly learn Spanish!<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is a lot like the process my daughter is going through  <br/>\nlearning guitar. She told her instructor what kind of music she liked  <br/>\nand they both work together on suggesting what she could learn.  <br/>\nSometimes she picks the songs. Sometimes he does. She likes the blues  <br/>\nbut he had a lot more knowledge and helped her a lot on what he  <br/>\nsuggested she learned. Sometimes she sees someone doing something and  <br/>\ntells him she&#39;d like to learn it. Sometimes she figures it out on her  <br/>\nown. While he suggests and helps because he has a bigger picture of  <br/>\nmusic, she&#39;s in the driver&#39;s seat and can decide which way to  <br/>\nultimately go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds scary when we&#39;re used to programmed learning! What if she  <br/>\nmisses something? Ah, the truth is that programmed learners miss  <br/>\nloads. They just don&#39;t know it! The programmed course leads them to  <br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s everything they need. People buy into that. But when you  <br/>\nwalk into work that first day, you realize how much you don&#39;t know!  <br/>\nAnd a much more useful skill is knowing that you don&#39;t know  <br/>\neverything but having the confidence you can learn it when you need  <br/>\nit -- rather than assuming you need someone to teach it to you :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n(That&#39;s not a perfect analogy since you need to know something to get  <br/>\nthe job! But with unschooling, kids are learning all along, getting  <br/>\nwhat they need to know. It&#39;s just a different process. They get to  <br/>\nthe job *better* prepared because they&#39;ve had the freedom to do real  <br/>\nlife versions of the job rather than cramming in esoteric information  <br/>\nthat might suit the type of job they might want one day.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beauty of learning by doing is that we naturally encounter what  <br/>\nwe need to know. We come across problems and learn -- as a side  <br/>\neffect -- what we need to get past it. We encounter everything we  <br/>\nneed in real life contexts.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as it was with learning English. Kids don&#39;t set out to learn  <br/>\nEnglish. They set out to get from life what they want. English is a  <br/>\ntool that that use. They don&#39;t even consciously try to improve their  <br/>\ntool use. They just get better at it by using it as a side effect of  <br/>\nwanting something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how unschooling works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; And sometimes they make take you through some<br/>\n&gt; seemingly meaningless things, like playing arpeggios,<br/>\n&gt; but you trust them, because you know they can take you<br/>\n&gt; somewhere you want to get to, and then later you can<br/>\n&gt; look back and see how it did make sense ... like &#39;Wax<br/>\n&gt; on, wax off&#39; from the Karate Kid. It may not have made<br/>\n&gt; sense to him, but he did it because he knew the<br/>\n&gt; teacher could help him get somewhere that he couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get on his own.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, people remember the times that worked for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are far more numerous times when it doesn&#39;t work, when it turns  <br/>\nsomeone off to something they would have enjoyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat turned me off to organ was learning songs that I didn&#39;t care to  <br/>\nlearn because there was supposedly a progression one had to go  <br/>\nthrough. The teachers went through it and it got them where they are  <br/>\nso the progression must work. Well, actually what it did was filter  <br/>\nout the people that process  didn&#39;t work for!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is learning to play the guitar by playing the rock songs  <br/>\nshe wants to play. She&#39;s motivated to work past the tough spots  <br/>\nbecause she wants the song. As opposed to the standard method of  <br/>\ncramming in all the stuff kids will one day need to play what they  <br/>\nwant. Most kids never get past the cramming part. My daughter gets to  <br/>\njump right to what she wants and learns what she needs as a side  <br/>\neffect because she wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Schuyler about the Karate Kid. Actually I like the scene  <br/>\nbecause I like the feeling of knowing something someone else doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nand making them do things to get them to understand not only what I  <br/>\nknow but that I&#39;m superior.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a power trip.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s a good thing to recognize so we can avoid doing it to our  <br/>\nkids because the other end of the power trip is *not* fun. The  <br/>\nlearner may learn something, but in the process they learn that  <br/>\nhaving power rocks and not having power sucks. It can motivate  <br/>\nsomeone to learn (have power) but it can also motivate people to lord  <br/>\ntheir power over others because they were deprived of power  <br/>\nthemselves. (They become sensei who foist the wax on wax off power  <br/>\ntrip onto their students because it was done to them.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Can a child really be wise enough to guide himself?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re imagining unschooling as parents stepping back and children  <br/>\nlearning everything on their own through their own discoveries, then no.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re imagining children having *the freedom* to explore  <br/>\naccording to their interests, then yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s our job as parents to run the parts of the world we think might  <br/>\ninterest them into their lives. And to help them reach what they&#39;re  <br/>\ntrying to reach. And to get out of their way when they&#39;re engaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of unschooling is being on the look out for things a child might  <br/>\nlike. Just as you might do for your wife. If you&#39;re in a bookstore  <br/>\nand see a book you&#39;re pretty sure she&#39;d like, you might buy it for  <br/>\nher or at least tell her. Let her know it exists. We do that for our  <br/>\nkids. But more actively since they can&#39;t be as much out in the world  <br/>\nas adults can, won&#39;t be scanning lists of classes and events for  <br/>\nsomething that sounds interesting. We use our superior knowledge of  <br/>\nthe world to filter out the stuff that probably won&#39;t interest them  <br/>\nso they can see the stuff of potential interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s *really* hard to see how it works when the only model someone is  <br/>\nfamiliar with is schooled kids who are being made to learn. Schooled  <br/>\nkids tend to avoid stuff that has the patina of school because they  <br/>\nnegatively associate those things with school. Unschooled kids don&#39;t  <br/>\nhave that. Shakespeare and Spongebob are all equal: something to like  <br/>\nor not like today.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Organic, unplanned, unexpected learning seems great,<br/>\n&gt; but are these people saying that there&#39;s NEVER a place<br/>\n&gt; for focused, structured, incremental learning as well?<br/>\n&gt; It seems like what would maximize learning potential<br/>\n&gt; would be to have the two together. Why would you throw<br/>\n&gt; all structured learning to the wind?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantage we have is that we know kids (our own and ourselves  <br/>\ntoo!) who have experienced forced learning and natural learning. We  <br/>\ncan see the difference. Those who have only experienced forced  <br/>\nlearning can only imagine what the effect of natural learning is by  <br/>\nextrapolating from forced learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t work. What seems likely to happen isn&#39;t what actually happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for focused, structured, incremental ... I think you&#39;re equating  <br/>\nit with forced learning. The two can be separated! My daughter has  <br/>\nbeen taking college math classes since she was 13. She likes them. To  <br/>\nher they&#39;re fun. Statistics, problem solving, algebra, pre-calculus.  <br/>\nTwo her father taught, all of them she and her Dad did the homework  <br/>\ntogether in the evening. What encouraged her to keep taking classes  <br/>\nwas that his goal wasn&#39;t for her to learn but to have fun. As a side  <br/>\neffect, she did learn. (Or at least did well on the tests which isn&#39;t  <br/>\nnecessarily the same thing!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat my husband does with our daughter is what, I think, people  <br/>\nimagine the ideal of structured learning is. Two people working  <br/>\ntogether, having fun in discovering  things through a structured  <br/>\ncourse. But it isn&#39;t the structured course that comes from. You can&#39;t  <br/>\nsit a child down with a course and expect that magic to happen. It  <br/>\ncomes from someone loving the material, being enthusiastic and not  <br/>\ncaring if the child does the material or not. The goal is to have  <br/>\nfun. If it&#39;s not fun, it gets dropped for something that is fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing about focused, structured, incremental learning is that  <br/>\nthe results are a lot easier to see. Structured education is more  <br/>\nsatisfying from someone *monitoring* the learning process. (It&#39;s also  <br/>\neasier for educators to prove to parents, states and the school board  <br/>\nthat learning is taking place.) We *assume* that since we can see the  <br/>\nlearning and the progress that it must be superior to learning  <br/>\norganically.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you prove that? How would you prove it? With a test that is  <br/>\ndesigned to test whether structured teaching has in fact resulted in  <br/>\nlearning?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan schools prove that their focused, structured, incremental process  <br/>\nworks? They have some kids that come out having done well on tests,  <br/>\nbut they also have kids who don&#39;t. They assume the process is  <br/>\nresponsible for the successes but without a control group how can  <br/>\nthey prove that claim? They can say the failures are the fault of the  <br/>\nkids or family life, but, again, without a control group, how can  <br/>\nthey prove that claim?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real proof is in what unschooled kids do as adults I think. We&#39;re  <br/>\nthe control group. Our kids are learning and moving on in life  <br/>\nwithout forced learning so it *can&#39;t* be the forced learning that is  <br/>\ncausing kids to learn in school. Fortunately we&#39;re paving the way  <br/>\nwith our own kids so you don&#39;t have to just trust that this is all  <br/>\nsome rosy glass type of deal. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244317154,"authorName":"swissarmy_wife","from":"&quot;swissarmy_wife&quot; &lt;heatherbean@...&gt;","profile":"swissarmy_wife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Need some good answers for my husband","postDate":"1203688238","msgId":30166,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZwbWp2ZStjNzJrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDgwMTk1NC44MTgzMC5xbUB3ZWI2NTUwNS5tYWlsLmFjNC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":30165,"nextInTopic":30167,"prevInTime":30165,"nextInTime":30167,"topicId":30165,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I d like to try a couple of these!

LOL   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Here are some of his comments:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *****************************************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Sometimes you need somebody to kinda help push you<br/>\n&gt; through a sticky spot [in learning and/or achieving<br/>\n&gt; something], and then you appreciate it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, the first thing that came to mind was would I rather be PUSHED<br/>\nthrough a cave or be guided through!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is a huge difference between pushed and guided.  In my<br/>\nexperience this isn&#39;t even unschooling specific.  It is also easy to<br/>\ncome to the conclusion that a child who isn&#39;t pushed doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\nelarn/achieve ANTYHING.  Especially given the resistance that public<br/>\nschool children have toward learning new things.  they are being<br/>\npushed every day.  Children who have never been to school or who are<br/>\ncompletely deschooled won&#39;t have that resistance.  Unless of course,<br/>\nit TRULY isn&#39;t something they want/need to learn right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ****************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I know from my own experience that there are certain<br/>\n&gt; things people are never going to be *very* good at,<br/>\n&gt; like playing an instrument well, or learning how to be<br/>\n&gt; a good computer programmer, without somebody who is<br/>\n&gt; wiser and knows how to lead you through it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And sometimes they make take you through some<br/>\n&gt; seemingly meaningless things, like playing arpeggios,<br/>\n&gt; but you trust them, because you know they can take you<br/>\n&gt; somewhere you want to get to, and then later you can<br/>\n&gt; look back and see how it did make sense ... like &#39;Wax<br/>\n&gt; on, wax off&#39; from the Karate Kid. It may not have made<br/>\n&gt; sense to him, but he did it because he knew the<br/>\n&gt; teacher could help him get somewhere that he couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get on his own.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I love the Karate kid movies!  They are my son&#39;s favorites!  You may<br/>\nalso notice that in the Karate Kid Mr. Miagi (sp) never once required<br/>\nanything of Daniel.  He offered his help and was open to Daniel when<br/>\nhe was ready.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Can a child really be wise enough to guide himself?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe this is another misconception of unschooling.  Unschooling isn&#39;t<br/>\nhands-off parenting.  It seems like I went through a short period of<br/>\ntime like that.  Where i was kind of hands off, and sat back thinking<br/>\nto myself, &quot;what&#39;s wrong here&quot;.  LOL  Maybe if you think of the parent<br/>\nas more of a facilitator.  Or a even a guide.  Or even &quot;partner in<br/>\ncrime&quot; is one of my favorites.  We do all sorts of things together<br/>\nnow, sometimes they are the kids ideas, sometimes they are mine.  It&#39;s<br/>\nbeen awhile since we&#39;ve really hunkered down and stuck to one<br/>\nthing/topic, but I will tell you that our lives are richer than they<br/>\never have been. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Organic, unplanned, unexpected learning seems great,<br/>\n&gt; but are these people saying that there&#39;s NEVER a place<br/>\n&gt; for focused, structured, incremental learning as well?<br/>\n&gt; It seems like what would maximize learning potential<br/>\n&gt; would be to have the two together. Why would you throw<br/>\n&gt; all structured learning to the wind?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not at all.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot of benefit to a child if they<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to do this type of learning.  Children (and this goes for<br/>\nhumans and animals) are the most curious beings.  They learn with all<br/>\ntheir senses.  It is only in recent times that we have decided that<br/>\nchildren need to learn only with books and teachers and one or two<br/>\nfield trips a year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he would agree that when the experience is joyful the learning<br/>\nis maximized.  When the learning is boring and forced, so much is<br/>\nlost.  Like...  Joy!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere may also be a time when someone chooses that type of focussed<br/>\nand structured learning.  But really, it isn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nconsidered the only and right way.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh, and this one I forgot about when I posted<br/>\n&gt; originally: &quot;I&#39;m afraid [our six year old daughter]<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t being challenged enough ... and the longer that<br/>\n&gt; goes on, the hesitant she&#39;ll be to challenge herself,<br/>\n&gt; and the more resistant she&#39;ll be to challenges. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; afraid that after a while she&#39;ll even start to feel<br/>\n&gt; like she&#39;s stupid.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know one always unschooled child that feels stupid.  I&#39;m not<br/>\nsaying this can&#39;t happen, or doesn&#39;t come up from tie to time.  But in<br/>\nmy experience it usually comes from constantly being compared to other<br/>\nkids your age.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95085137,"authorName":"Jennifer","from":"Jennifer &lt;beanmommy2@...&gt;","profile":"beanmommy2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Need some good answers for my husband","postDate":"1203686282","msgId":30165,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgwMTk1NC44MTgzMC5xbUB3ZWI2NTUwNS5tYWlsLmFjNC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30166,"prevInTime":30164,"nextInTime":30166,"topicId":30165,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"[I posted this on AlwaysLearning last night and then realized I really should have posted it here.} Our oldest child is almost seven and is unschooling.
