It wasn&#39;t my plan to not train him I<br/>\njust didn&#39;t get around to it .. I bought the potty chair and right away he<br/>\ntook it out of the bathroom and put it in front of the TV and watched<br/>\ncartoons on it. One day I came into the living room to find him sitting on<br/>\nthe potty naked from the waste down and going in it. From then on he used<br/>\nthe potty. He didn&#39;t have accidents and went from diapers to regular<br/>\nunderwear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did try to train my daughter and a lot of it went like you are describing<br/>\n.. sometimes she would be happy to use the potty but other times she wanted<br/>\nher diaper. For a short period I was asking if she needed to use the potty a<br/>\nlot, she&#39;d always say no and took to hiding in the hallway to poop. As soon<br/>\nas I realized she was hiding to do her business I stopped the training.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my 3rd child I went back to just leaving the potty chair out for him<br/>\nand he used it when he was ready and aside from some video game induced<br/>\naccidents he really didn&#39;t have any accidents either. He did poop on the<br/>\nfloor next to the potty chair a couple times, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience the two kids I did not train went from diapers to undies<br/>\nvery smoothly. My daughter didn&#39;t like the training and I think she held on<br/>\nto her diapers longer because I tried to get her out of them. I think she<br/>\nwas about 3 1/2 before she was completely out of diapers. The boys were both<br/>\nright about 3 when they started using the potty by choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice would be to do nothing.
