I know they have felt &quot;strange&quot; saying it when  we don&#39;t do subjects or grades. <br/>\nThey seem to be able to grasp more of what  unschooling is lately  and to  talk about it on occasion. <br/>\n I will be making an effort to explain the  concept of &quot;we dont do grades when we are just living our lives&quot;<br/>\nand that &quot;It doesn&#39;t sound useful or reasonable to  think that everything we do is only what &quot;grade fours do&quot;-they know that anyway: but I can see that they arent sure there is any other acceptable way. <br/>\nWhen  the subject comes around  I will see if they  want to hear  me say anything.<br/>\nThey are quick to say we are in grade 4  when a stranger asks and I doubt they want to say any more anyway when they are only politely  answering a query in a store or whatever.<br/>\nI have talked a lot to my husband  (who is fully on board although he had  never heard of the unschooling concept <br/>\nIt just makes so much sense to him -having a grade 8 education-a basically illiterate european immigrant family-worked his way up to a skilled labourer job before his work injury/retirement-developed all his skills on his own  by working and observing.
