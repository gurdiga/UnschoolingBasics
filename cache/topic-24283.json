We can be needy for things we <br/>\nthink we&#39;re not getting enough of.  That&#39;s a problem with limits.<br/>\n<br/>\n***so it may not be a carb issue as I originally thought.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems very likely an issue with allowed foods and their availability.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I hope you&#39;re not saying that families with kids that must be on<br/>\nspecial diets cannot also be unschoolers. :)***<br/>\n<br/>\nAnytime one person is limiting the choices for another person it can <br/>\ninterfere with unschooling.   That doesn&#39;t mean a parent will never limit a <br/>\nchild&#39;s choice, it means that parent might deal with issues other <br/>\nunschooling parents don&#39;t have.   If you&#39;re in that situation it may not <br/>\nalways be easy to reconcile a particular decision with unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had a child with a severe allergy to some food I would definitely have <br/>\nkept that food out of the house.  I would have socialized with people who <br/>\ncould easily and happily accommodate us and avoided going into the homes of <br/>\nthose who couldn&#39;t, until my kid was old enough to understand and avoid <br/>\nthose foods on his own.  I have some experience with a child who chose a <br/>\ndiet different from anyone else we knew when he was very young, and I know a <br/>\nvery young person is capable of choosing and deciding.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn immediate life threatening allergy is different from an ethical choice <br/>\nand even different from a general health maintenance diet.   We know enough <br/>\nabout human psychology to know that even people who&#39;ve had quadruple bypass <br/>\nsurgery and have been told that they should change their diet if they want <br/>\nto continue to live well can have a difficult time or even find it <br/>\nimpossible to stick to a diet prescribed by someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd like the bypass patient, who can feel resentful toward his doctor about <br/>\nthe diet limits even though the clogged arteries were not the doctors fault, <br/>\nkids on restrictive diets can feel resentful toward the person who enforced <br/>\nthe diet.   That&#39;s a potential problem that can interfere with unschooling. <br/>\nIf you&#39;re creative and thoughtful you might be able to make a difficult <br/>\nsituation work but it&#39;s not an ideal situation and that&#39;s what I meant.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Calling a diet that<br/>\neliminates those substances &quot;restrictive&quot; is like calling an<br/>\nenvironment that limits or excludes radon, strychnine and arsenic<br/>\n&quot;restrictive&quot;.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a difference. &lt;g&gt;   Your kids will probably never look at arsenic <br/>\nlaced river sediment and want to eat a big plate full.  They might very much <br/>\nwant to try some chocolate cake.  The difference is in their desire. The <br/>\ndifference is in their psyche. That&#39;s the difference that matters to <br/>\nunschooling.   When a person wants something they can&#39;t have they feel <br/>\nrestricted.   I&#39;ve never met a kid who was longing for radon but maybe I&#39;m <br/>\njust hanging with a different crowd. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids haven&#39;t made the association between certain foods and how <br/>\nthose foods leave them feeling then not getting the chocolate cake leaves a <br/>\nbig hole of need.   The hole is the problem with regards to unschooling. <br/>\nAs their mom you should avoid the holes as much as possible.   I don&#39;t think <br/>\nyou can do that by limiting the foods their allowed to have.  And I think <br/>\nthat was your original question, why are they so needy and what can you do <br/>\nabout it.  They&#39;re needy because they already feel limited, they already <br/>\nhave a hole.  What can you do about it?  Fill them up.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven when adults can make an association between an activity or food and the <br/>\nway that activity or food makes them feel, they often choose the activity or <br/>\nfood because they believe the pleasure of the thing is worth feeling <br/>\nuncomfortable later.     Emotionally healthy people can make those choices <br/>\nand still give consideration to their physical health and maintain a <br/>\nbalance.    Emotionally needy people just keep trying to fill the hole <br/>\ninside them, sometimes at the expense of their physical health. <br/>\nUnschooling won&#39;t work where people are emotionally unbalanced, where their <br/>\nunfulfilled need is driving them.   You&#39;re unschooling mission, if you <br/>\nchoose to accept it, is to eliminate neediness. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n***We cannot buy just any rice flour/noodles we find cheaply<br/>\nbecause there is a lot of cross-contamination when flours are<br/>\nrun/ground/processed on the same equipment.***<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you can find a used flour mill on ebay or on a swap board and grind <br/>\nyour own.  Advertise in your local paper that you want a free flour grinder. <br/>\nSome old lady might have one in her basement.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have friends and family members who buy birthday and Christmas gifts <br/>\nfor your family, maybe you could suggest gift certificates at the health <br/>\nfood store so the kids can by a bunch of their favorite things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live ninety one miles from the best health food store.  There&#39;s a small <br/>\none thirty six miles away but they don&#39;t have everything we like, and <br/>\nthere&#39;s another one about sixty miles away, also short on some things we <br/>\ntypically buy.    They will mail some items to us and in the winter or with <br/>\ngas prices as high as they are, this is sometimes an economical and <br/>\nconvenient option.   So if you live a distance from your health food store <br/>\nask about getting some items shipped to you.   What a nice surprise for your <br/>\nkids to get their favorite cookies in the mail some week you didn&#39;t have <br/>\ntime to get to the health food store!<br/>\n<br/>\nRice puddings are easy treats if your kids like sweets.  Chocolate rice <br/>\npudding is one of my favorite foods. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother makes peanut butter cookies without flour.    He says his kids <br/>\nlove them.

It&#39;s *my* responsibility to make sure<br/>\nthey have what they need and of course I would never let them walk<br/>\naround the house starving! I want to emphasize that week to week they<br/>\n*are* getting enough to eat nutritionally and they&#39;re in excellent<br/>\nphysical health. As someone else pointed out, there are carbs in<br/>\nvegetables and fruits and they eat lots of those, so it may not be a<br/>\ncarb issue as I originally thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they&#39;re grazers and need to eat smaller portions more frequently<br/>\nthroughout the day. They may need more fats since we tend to avoid<br/>\nbutter substitutes because of trans fats and fish/seafood because of<br/>\nmercury levels. I&#39;m going to try to find alternate sources of<br/>\nomega-3/6 oils and other beneficial fats. I really like the monkey<br/>\nplatter idea I read about on Sandra&#39;s site. I realize it is my<br/>\nresponsibility to help them figure out what their needs are and I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen thinking a lot about this stuff. The main issue at hand is<br/>\nfinding a way to provide them with enough of the *specific* foods they<br/>\ndesire to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are you willing to rethink the diet issue? Are typically reported benefits<br/>\n&gt; of this diet going to help your kids to a degree that will make the<br/>\n&gt; potential emotional food related issues worth the risk?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It has *very* greatly improved their quality of life and resolved<br/>\nseveral dozen health issues. I realize this diet doesn&#39;t work for<br/>\neveryone and that some people see little, if any, improvement. We&#39;re<br/>\nfortunate in that regard because it&#39;s worked amazingly well for our<br/>\nkids. Being free of gluten & casein has made dramatic differences in<br/>\ntheir lives. Their improvements have absolutely floored their doctors<br/>\nand even prompted a research study. The diet isn&#39;t something we&#39;ve<br/>\nrandomly and mindlessly decided to force upon them. They both have<br/>\nceliac disease and *must* be gluten free. They also have a milk<br/>\nallergy as well, so being both gf and cf is working well for them.<br/>\nIt&#39;s the way they will eat for life, it&#39;s what they will have to live<br/>\nwith always.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do your kids<br/>\n&gt; feel about being on the diet?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They have been on this diet for most of their lives so it is what<br/>\nthey&#39;re used to and they really enjoy their foods. It is as normal to<br/>\nthem as it is for my mom to avoid chocolate because she is allergic.<br/>\nIt&#39;s just a fact of life for them, like people who need to avoid<br/>\npeanuts or strawberries or any other food that seriously affects a<br/>\nperson&#39;s health and well being. The diet itself is not an area of<br/>\ncontention or disagreement with the kids. However, I know they would<br/>\nbe happier with having more of certain foods they really like and tend<br/>\nto crave, and I am trying to find a way to give them that.<br/>\n<br/>\n97% of the time the kids don&#39;t mind their diet. The other 3% are those<br/>\ntimes when they see something they can&#39;t have, like if we are at<br/>\nsomeone&#39;s house and someone (unexpectedly) pulls a big delicious<br/>\nlooking chocolate cake out of the fridge and the kids wish they could<br/>\nhave some. We try to prepare for most situations by making sure we<br/>\nhave their gfcf equivalent on hand for them, but there are times when<br/>\nwe&#39;re taken by surprise. But there are also (and increasingly more<br/>\noften) times when they barely notice a plate of regular cookies and<br/>\ndon&#39;t give a second glance to someone eating a cheesy pizza.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The difference is<br/>\n&gt; unschooling is not about restricting and limiting kids but about creating a<br/>\n&gt; life of abundance and the diet is restrictive and limiting.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hope you&#39;re not saying that families with kids that must be on<br/>\nspecial diets cannot also be unschoolers.  :)    It would be so much<br/>\neasier if they did not have these special dietary needs. It would be<br/>\nconsiderably less difficult (and less expensive) to shop for food, we<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have to worry about them getting exposed to<br/>\ncross-contamination, we wouldn&#39;t have to pack up their foods every<br/>\ntime we leave the house, etc. Although I do see everything we do as a<br/>\nchoice, even if all the available options are difficult, and despite<br/>\nall these challenges, knowing what we know now, I feel it would be<br/>\nirresponsible and dangerous to give them gluten & dairy foods.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s my belief (unproven by scientific<br/>\n&gt; study &lt;g&gt;) that my support of Dylan&#39;s choices has been more beneficial to<br/>\n&gt; his overall health than a diet would have been and especially if the diet<br/>\n&gt; was not something he chose for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I totally understand that reasoning and under different circumstances<br/>\nwe might do the same thing! My kids were very young when they went<br/>\ngfcf, but they &quot;spoke out&quot; about their needs the only way they could.<br/>\nMy son was miserable and cried nearly all the time, didn&#39;t want to be<br/>\ntouched (his skin was extremely sensitive) and he threw up a lot. He<br/>\nhad to be treated for pneumonia repeatedly. He was diagnosed with<br/>\nsevere asthma and GERD (among other things) which required 6 different<br/>\ndaily medications that he did not like to take. My daughter complained<br/>\nof nearly constant stomach pains, had bowel problems, couldn&#39;t sleep<br/>\nwell at night, had poor speech and was very clumsy. We took her to the<br/>\nER several times for serious head bumps.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing gfcf cleared most of these issues up within a week and DS was<br/>\nable to go off all his meds. He no longer has asthma or throws up and<br/>\nhe enjoys being held. DD no longer has stomach pains or bowel problems<br/>\nand her speech & agility improved tremendously and very rapidly.<br/>\nThat&#39;s just a *very* brief overview - there are so many more things<br/>\nthat improved, including numerous developmental issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile they didn&#39;t really choose this diet in the sense of actively<br/>\ndeciding to do it voluntarily because they were so young, within a<br/>\nweek we could see it was clearly beneficial in many ways. We have<br/>\ntalked to them about it over the years and they know why they are<br/>\ngfcf. There has (unfortunately) been a few times when they<br/>\naccidentally ate non-gfcf foods and they ended up pretty sick and many<br/>\nof the old problems reappeared with a bang. DD in particular has a<br/>\n&quot;physical memory&quot; of eating non-gfcf foods and she takes great care to<br/>\navoid feeling like that again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can you make a deal with your supplier to buy case loads of favorite foods<br/>\n&gt; at a better price?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So far this hasn&#39;t been an option but we&#39;re looking into a natural<br/>\nfoods co-op a few towns away to see if that will give us more buying<br/>\npower. In the past few days I&#39;ve been brainstorming about ways to find<br/>\ntheir foods at better prices. I found several really good coupons<br/>\nonline which will help out. I didn&#39;t even know there were coupons for<br/>\nthese foods until I searched - the only thing I ever see in my local<br/>\npaper are coupons for cleaning supplies, pet food, canned veggies and<br/>\ndeodorant. I&#39;m very happy about this discovery!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve spent some time fine-tuning our grocery budget and making more $$<br/>\navailable for their specialty products. I&#39;m also going to take<br/>\nadvantage of every sale I can find. This past Saturday I was grocery<br/>\nshopping and came across a display of close-out products. I about<br/>\njumped for joy when I saw a whole shelf of gluten-free pastas & cereal<br/>\nbars on sale for *half off*. Whohoo! I went over my shopping list and<br/>\neliminated a few things so that I could afford to buy everything they<br/>\nhad at that price. The kids are tickled about this find. I think if I<br/>\nsearch better and comparison shop, I can find good deals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Fifteen dollars isn&#39;t that much (but I&#39;ve also lived through<br/>\n&gt; times when fifteen dollars was nearly impossible to come by)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ahh - this is our situation right now, but there is a good reason for<br/>\nit and I know things will improve in the future. We&#39;re all doing<br/>\nwithout/sacrificing to a certain extent, but we&#39;ve been trying to<br/>\nlessen the impact of this on the kids as much as possible. This period<br/>\nof tight finances will not last forever. It too shall pass...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Can you buy bulk amounts at the best price of the ingredients to make their<br/>\n&gt; favorite things? &lt;snip&gt; or your local Asian market<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Someone else suggested going to an Asian market and buying in bulk.<br/>\nThere is one about an hour from us and we&#39;re going to check on their<br/>\nprices. We cannot buy just any rice flour/noodles we find cheaply<br/>\nbecause there is a lot of cross-contamination when flours are<br/>\nrun/ground/processed on the same equipment. The products we buy at<br/>\nlocal specialty stores are more expensive but have been tested for the<br/>\npresence of gluten & are processed on dedicated lines. We&#39;ll<br/>\ndefinitely investigate the Asian food market option though! It would<br/>\nbe great if we can find what we need at a good price.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can you trade out for services?

There are unchangeable, unavoidable<br/>\n&quot;restrictions&quot; people have to live with every day - lots of kids are<br/>\nborn with physical & mental challenges. For my kids a gfcf diet isn&#39;t<br/>\nrestrictive in a traditional sense of the word because there is no<br/>\nviable alternative for them - it&#39;s just another aspect of their lives.<br/>\nFor them, gluten & dairy are akin to poisons. Calling a diet that<br/>\neliminates those substances &quot;restrictive&quot; is like calling an<br/>\nenvironment that limits or excludes radon, strychnine and arsenic<br/>\n&quot;restrictive&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really part of trying to provide them with the best possible care<br/>\nand no matter what their diet is labeled as - &quot;restrictive&quot; or &quot;safe &<br/>\nhealthy&quot; - it doesn&#39;t change their dietary needs and they&#39;ll have to<br/>\ngo forward with these same needs their whole life no matter how<br/>\nwe/they/others choose to view them. So we might as well not choose to<br/>\nlook at the diet from a negative light, but instead to look at how it<br/>\nhas a positive impact.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe true limiting issue comes from them not having as much desired<br/>\nfood items as they would like, which is why I asked for advice &<br/>\nideas, because I want to remedy that. There have been lots of great<br/>\nsuggestions and I&#39;m in full problem-solving mode now, so I think we&#39;ll<br/>\nfind a way to meet their needs for these foods and continue down our<br/>\nunschooling path!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your reply! Your comments have helped me re-examine<br/>\nthe benefits of their diet and reaffirm that, regardless of cost, it<br/>\nis a blessing it is to be able to provide them with something that<br/>\ngives them a better quality of life.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Help with Food Limits","postDate":"1181659411","msgId":24407,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2IwMWM3YWQwMCQwYmUwNjhkMCQwMjAxYThjMEBkZWJvcmFoNzZhNzlodj4="},"prevInTopic":24399,"nextInTopic":24414,"prevInTime":24406,"nextInTime":24408,"topicId":24283,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***What to do?

Our kids don&#39;t have a<br/>\nresponsibility to be only as hungry as we want them or can afford for them<br/>\nto be.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you willing to rethink the diet issue?   Are typically reported benefits<br/>\nof this diet going to help your kids to a degree that will make the<br/>\npotential emotional food related issues worth the risk?   How do your kids<br/>\nfeel about being on the diet?   If your kids are willingly on the diet they<br/>\nmight have ideas about making things stretch.   If your kids don&#39;t have the <br/>\noption of quitting the diet then<br/>\nit wouldn&#39;t be right to ask them for ideas about further limiting their <br/>\nfoods.   (You don&#39;t have to share more information<br/>\nwith us than you want... I&#39;m just saying getting the kids to agree to <br/>\nlimiting foods if they really don&#39;t have a choice about being<br/>\non the diet is not really agreement or choice.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI only read briefly about this diet and it seems there is one study that <br/>\nshowed some<br/>\nbenefit to kids and that study isn&#39;t widely supported.  I don&#39;t believe <br/>\nthere has to be scientific proof a<br/>\nthing is beneficial for it to be so.   The benefits of unschooling are not<br/>\nscientifically proven and the reports of benefits come from parents relating<br/>\ntheir experiences.  (much like the gfcf diet, it seems)    The difference is<br/>\nunschooling is not about restricting and limiting kids but about creating a<br/>\nlife of abundance and the diet is restrictive and limiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Dylan was first diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis we looked at the<br/>\ninformation about diet.  The benefits of a restricted diet were not<br/>\nconclusive and Dylan decided it wasn&#39;t worth it to him to give up some of<br/>\nthe things he loved for a &quot;possible&quot; benefit.    Dylan had already chosen a<br/>\nprimarily vegan diet (he occasionally eats honey) for himself, for<br/>\nethical reasons but was not willing to further limit his diet for<br/>\nunproven potential health benefits.   It&#39;s my belief (unproven by scientific<br/>\nstudy &lt;g&gt;) that my support of Dylan&#39;s choices has been more beneficial to<br/>\nhis overall health than a diet would have been and especially if the diet<br/>\nwas not something he chose for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the diet stays:<br/>\nCan you make a deal with your supplier to buy case loads of favorite foods <br/>\nat a better price?<br/>\nCan you buy bulk amounts at the best price of the ingredients to make their<br/>\nfavorite things?<br/>\nA quick search showed a fifty pound bag of rice flour at Amazon ($4.50<br/>\nshipping) for  $56.00.    That&#39;s about fifteen dollars more than a fifty<br/>\npound bag of organic wheat flour.   Fifteen dollars isn&#39;t that much (but <br/>\nI&#39;ve also lived through<br/>\ntimes when fifteen dollars was nearly impossible to come by)   Start a coop <br/>\nand buy two hundred pounds<br/>\nat a time and see what kind of deal your health food store or your local<br/>\nAsian market can make you.   Can you grind your own rice flour?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere in your budget can you make changes to increase money available for<br/>\nfood?   Can you drop magazine subscriptions?  Can you cut out services you<br/>\nnow pay for?  Can you trade out for services?  (an example might be cleaning<br/>\nthe Karate Dojo in exchange for kid&#39;s lessons.)   Can you get a part time<br/>\njob?   Handyman or clean or mow lawns for extra cash?<br/>\n<br/>\nFood is already an issue for them.    You&#39;ve linked food to behavior and<br/>\nyou&#39;ve restricted some foods.  They likely already feel needy.  Any further<br/>\nrestricting you do could create more need.  You can either let them decide<br/>\nwhether it&#39;s worth it or decide for them.

I have been a little<br/>\nconcerned/disturbed (?) by my kids writing their names on things in<br/>\nthe refrigerator... mostly soft drinks lately.   We rarely buy it and<br/>\nwhat led to them writing their names on it was that they would put one<br/>\nin the fridge to chill then come back and someone else has taken it<br/>\nnot realizing someone had put it in for themselves!   We did make a<br/>\n&quot;rule of consideration&quot; (our own little coined phrase for when rules<br/>\nare necessary for harmony)  that if they take out a bottled water they<br/>\nshould make sure to put in a few more for others to have a cold one<br/>\nwhen they need it.     At any rate my husband bought a large variety<br/>\nbox of Jone&#39;s Sodas at Sam&#39;s ...because the kids each wanted to try<br/>\nseveral flavors they wrote their names on the bottles in the fridge. <br/>\nAt first it struck me as somewhat selfish.  Later I saw my 5 yr old<br/>\ngladly give his 12 yr old sister one he had already claimed that she<br/>\ndecided she might like to try but found there were no more of that<br/>\nflavor.  They have been gladly giving each other a taste of ones they<br/>\nfound especially yummy that their siblings didn&#39;t think they would<br/>\nlike but wanted to have a taste later.    <br/>\nWe also have food allergies (our 5 yr old) so I do buy specific things<br/>\nfor him that can be expensive.   So far I haven&#39;t had to limit<br/>\nanything because the others are rarely interested in his Rice Dream<br/>\nice cream or his Rice Dream rice milk.     They do occasionally have a<br/>\nfew of his cookies or other things.   In our case I have managed to<br/>\nfind recipes for most things so that I can make them more cheaply and<br/>\nhave them readily available in whatever amounts we need them.     A<br/>\nfew times I have come across a teen happily munching on the<br/>\ndairy/wheat free cookies and had a moment of panic (because of the<br/>\nexpense and thinking of the 5 yr olds face when others are having<br/>\nregular cookies and his are gone!)  usually I just remind them that<br/>\nthose are the dairy/wheat free ones and ask that they make sure they<br/>\nleave some for their brother.   Most of the time they hadn&#39;t realized<br/>\nthey were the special cookies and immediately switch to regular ones.<br/>\n  Sometimes they remark that they like those better and I make sure I<br/>\nbuy a larger amount the next time!    <br/>\nThanks for all the great reassuring discussion on this topic!

We don&#39;t buy the specialty stuff except for <br/>\none or two packages. One, they go bad quite quickly, two, they usually taste funny and <br/>\nthree, they are very expensive. We also do not buy the ingredients at the health food store, <br/>\nwhere rice flour is $5 a pound. We buy it at a Chinese supermarket,(its an hour drive from <br/>\nhere but worth it), where it&#39;s 50¢ for two pounds. We also buy rice noodles there,  they are <br/>\nusually 75¢ a pound. For the most part, we don&#39;t eat breads. We usually don&#39;t eat pasta <br/>\neither, but have a lot of rice, mashed potatoes or sweet potato cubes under our sauces.  <br/>\nSandwiches are just as good separated on the plate, or wrapped in a warm corn tortilla, <br/>\nand usually taste better than the rice bread.<br/>\nBecause we buy rice flour, tapioca starch and whatever else we need there, we save a lot of <br/>\nmoney and make our own muffins, cookies, etc. We also save a fortune on not buying <br/>\nregular snack foods, that are not safe. So I feel pretty good about buying snacks that are <br/>\nsafe because of all the money we have saved in not buying Oreo&#39;s, doritos, etc. You can <br/>\nbuy a lot of chips, a LOT of frito lays stuff is GFCF. that&#39;s about as carby as it gets. There&#39;s <br/>\na website that&#39;s good for what you can buy, alot of it is specialty, but alot not. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tacanow.com/foodlist.htm\">http://www.tacanow.com/foodlist.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nanyway, kids get a lot of carbs from fruits and veggies, my kids do seek snack foods <br/>\nbecause they fulfill a niche, their sweet tooth and salty tongue etc etc. :-) That regular <br/>\nfood just does NOT hit. <br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Susan &lt;SusanYvonne@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have kids with special dietary needs?

My two kiddos are on<br/>\n&gt; a gfcf diet and I&#39;m struggling with how to handle their access to the<br/>\n&gt; special foods we buy each week because they are *so* darn expensive<br/>\n&gt; that we can&#39;t afford to buy all that they would prefer to eat each<br/>\n&gt; week.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So... should I just buy whatever we can afford, not limit it at all<br/>\n&gt; and then when it&#39;s gone it&#39;s gone? My concern (the hump I haven&#39;t been<br/>\n&gt; able to get over) is that it means this specialty food is usually<br/>\n&gt; consumed within the first 2-3 days which leaves no bread (or other<br/>\n&gt; grain items like muffins, pancakes, cookies, etc) for the rest of the<br/>\n&gt; week. This leaves them eating protein, veggies, and fruit for the<br/>\n&gt; remaining 4-5 days and while I realize that sounds like a strange<br/>\n&gt; thing to be concerned about, lol, both kids need lots of carbs in<br/>\n&gt; their diet or they get irritable pretty quickly and tend to &quot;search&quot;<br/>\n&gt; for food all day as if they aren&#39;t satisfied, even after eating (which<br/>\n&gt; they might not be if the meal was lacking in carbs).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also think this has set up a cycle of binging and then doing without<br/>\n&gt; which leads to binging again the next time the food&#39;s available and<br/>\n&gt; then doing without again for many days. I have a feeling that if we<br/>\n&gt; could afford to fill the house with an abundant supply, they would<br/>\n&gt; eventually relax and not feel the urge to eat it all up in 2 days<br/>\n&gt; flat. I see that this is the hording thing that happens when kids (and<br/>\n&gt; adults) feel like they might not get more. Unfortunately, we can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; afford to buy this much. I&#39;m thinking that if, day after day, there<br/>\n&gt; was some available they might realize there will always be more<br/>\n&gt; tomorrow and this would help them relax. Right now it&#39;s binge,<br/>\n&gt; nothing, binge, nothing. This is the only food they do this with btw,<br/>\n&gt; but of course they are not limited in quantity on any other items,<br/>\n&gt; either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What to do? While I don&#39;t want to set restrictions or limits, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; seeing that it might be necessary to plan a certain allotment for each<br/>\n&gt; day and make that available each morning and then not set restrictions<br/>\n&gt; or limits on when/where/how they eat it.

You can get a jar of loose popcorn for like $2 and a microwave popping bowl..then use ghee or a bit of the fleshmans light instead of butter...most mcormic seasonings are gfcf so a good way to experiemnt with different flavorings for the popcorn. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  www.allergygrocer.com  may have better prices than those charged at local health food stores if you havent tried it before.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBored stiff?

My two kiddos are on<br/>\na gfcf diet and I&#39;m struggling with how to handle their access to the<br/>\nspecial foods we buy each week because they are *so* darn expensive<br/>\nthat we can&#39;t afford to buy all that they would prefer to eat each<br/>\nweek.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... should I just buy whatever we can afford, not limit it at all<br/>\nand then when it&#39;s gone it&#39;s gone? My concern (the hump I haven&#39;t been<br/>\nable to get over) is that it means this specialty food is usually<br/>\nconsumed within the first 2-3 days which leaves no bread (or other<br/>\ngrain items like muffins, pancakes, cookies, etc) for the rest of the<br/>\nweek. This leaves them eating protein, veggies, and fruit for the<br/>\nremaining 4-5 days and while I realize that sounds like a strange<br/>\nthing to be concerned about, lol, both kids need lots of carbs in<br/>\ntheir diet or they get irritable pretty quickly and tend to &quot;search&quot;<br/>\nfor food all day as if they aren&#39;t satisfied, even after eating (which<br/>\nthey might not be if the meal was lacking in carbs).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think this has set up a cycle of binging and then doing without<br/>\nwhich leads to binging again the next time the food&#39;s available and<br/>\nthen doing without again for many days. I have a feeling that if we<br/>\ncould afford to fill the house with an abundant supply, they would<br/>\neventually relax and not feel the urge to eat it all up in 2 days<br/>\nflat. I see that this is the hording thing that happens when kids (and<br/>\nadults) feel like they might not get more. Unfortunately, we can&#39;t<br/>\nafford to buy this much. I&#39;m thinking that if, day after day, there<br/>\nwas some available they might realize there will always be more<br/>\ntomorrow and this would help them relax. Right now it&#39;s binge,<br/>\nnothing, binge, nothing. This is the only food they do this with btw,<br/>\nbut of course they are not limited in quantity on any other items,<br/>\neither.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat to do? While I don&#39;t want to set restrictions or limits, I&#39;m<br/>\nseeing that it might be necessary to plan a certain allotment for each<br/>\nday and make that available each morning and then not set restrictions<br/>\nor limits on when/where/how they eat it. But this is still restricting<br/>\nin a sense, but they don&#39;t have access to the whole supply in the<br/>\nhouse, so I&#39;m just not sure how to make peace with this.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24509,"nextTopicId":24322}}
