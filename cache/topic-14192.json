I&#39;ve looked into and tried out unschooling a couple <br/>\nof times in the past 4+ years of homeschooling but it&#39;s only been in <br/>\nthe last 5 months that I really, really get it.  People really new <br/>\nto this concept really want unschooling to be easy or to just fit in <br/>\ncertain areas of their lives such as academic work.  But I have <br/>\nlearned that it&#39;s really about lifestyle changes and viewing my <br/>\nchildren in a totally different light.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you said you saw harsh posts in other subjects, but this <br/>\nparticular thread is being continued by one person who doesn&#39;t seem <br/>\nto spend much time answering the responses she&#39;s getting.  Instead, <br/>\nshe&#39;s asking lots of questions that seem to be running along the <br/>\nsame vein.  I know I&#39;ve responded to her and never got any <br/>\nacknowledgement at all.  I have no idea if she read my note and what <br/>\nher thoughts may be.  You&#39;re right, we did give her reading <br/>\nsuggestions when what she might want to do is talk this all <br/>\nthrough.  But she&#39;s not really carrying on a conversation.  It&#39;s <br/>\nmore like brief questions and minimal answers, no thought-provoking <br/>\ndiscussion at all.  I truly get the impression, and I can certainly <br/>\nbe wrong, that she has NO desire to unschool but is looking into it <br/>\nso she can tell her son that she read about it and disagrees with <br/>\nit.  It&#39;s like she&#39;s condemning it before truly understanding it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am learning that the best thing to do is really talk out your <br/>\nconcerns.  If someone yells with all caps, it&#39;s not because they are <br/>\ntrying to be harsh but they are trying to add inflection into their <br/>\npost that is absent in this medium of communications.  Also, <br/>\ndiscussing something like unschooling just isn&#39;t going to happen in <br/>\none or two exchanges of emails.  We&#39;re talking a whole lifestyle <br/>\nhere that encompasses so very much.  But anyway, if you feel <br/>\nsomething is particularly harsh and you don&#39;t understand the meaning <br/>\nof the post, respond and ask, just like you did on this thread.  But <br/>\nunderstand discussion should truly be between at least 2 people, a <br/>\ngive and take.  Not just asking the same questions over and over and <br/>\nexpecting different responses.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Is it enough?","postDate":"1150172653","msgId":14471,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzQzJCMjUzLTQyQjUtNDNFNy04OUY4LUFDOURDQjE5MDJENkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA3YjcwMWM2OGU5NCQ4NWY2NjdlMCQwNDAwYThjMEBTUGllcmN5Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDA3YjcwMWM2OGU5NCQ4NWY2NjdlMCQwNDAwYThjMEBTUGllcmN5Pg=="},"prevInTopic":14468,"nextInTopic":14473,"prevInTime":14470,"nextInTime":14472,"topicId":14192,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You know how they say, Beauty is in the eye of the beholder?

Not if they&#39;re really unschooling!!<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about choice.<br/>\nUnschooling is about freedom to learn what you want, when you want the<br/>\ninformation.<br/>\nUnschooling is about TRUSTING that children learn all the time, from<br/>\neverything in the world and don&#39;t need coercion in order to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nCoercion is detrimental to unschooling.<br/>\nTrust and joy can not unfold as beautifully in a home where there<br/>\nisn&#39;t a very strong bond of trust between parent and child.<br/>\nHow can your child learn to trust themselves if you&#39;re sending<br/>\nmessages that they can&#39;t be trusted? How can they see the learning in<br/>\nALL that they love, if you&#39;re sending a message that they need to be<br/>\ntaught?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome unschoolers choose academic types of learning and schoolish<br/>\nlooking activities at some point, sure. But that IS NOT the goal. If<br/>\nthat&#39;s the goal, unschooling is a really bad idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved chatting with the Carey&#39;s up in Peabody (the other family in<br/>\nthe People mag. article) whose daughter is in Harvard now. They talk<br/>\nabout their unschooling experiences and academics/college were<br/>\ncertainly NOT their goal. They didn&#39;t care if she chose to bag<br/>\ngroceries or become a lawyer...they really just totally supported<br/>\nher!! She&#39;s thriving on academics, but they&#39;d be just as happy if she<br/>\nwasn&#39;t! That&#39;s the key. Letting your child BE who they are, exactly as<br/>\nthey are today. It&#39;s getting excited about the things they love,<br/>\nbecause it shows you about WHO-THEY-ARE. How cool is that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your goals is higher test scores, better academic achievments and<br/>\nhaving a college bound child, then get off the ship now. Truly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your goal is a child that knows themselves and is comfortable in<br/>\ntheir own skin, that trusts their unique abilities, that feels whole<br/>\nand capable and trusted,that knows they can learn anything and anytime<br/>\nin life, then keep on plugging away...unschooling is for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Is it enough?","postDate":"1149781200","msgId":14203,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU2OWdjZytpOTYwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":14192,"nextInTopic":14228,"prevInTime":14202,"nextInTime":14204,"topicId":14192,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I guess I don t see why making him do 45 minutes of workbooks a day is going to interfere too much with his goals and aspirations.
