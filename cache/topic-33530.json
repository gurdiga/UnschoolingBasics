But it is <br/>\ninteresting that despite 10% of the population having dyslexia not a <br/>\nsingle child there has not become a competent reader in their own <br/>\ntime.  Sometime between 4 and 12 they all did learn to read and <br/>\nwrite.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience with my daughter she never did anything until she was <br/>\na master of it.  There was no external learning &quot;process&quot; she either <br/>\ncould or could not.  But then once she could she totally could.
