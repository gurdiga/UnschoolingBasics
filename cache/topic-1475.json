They don&#39;t have a problem with winning<br/>\nand losing at board games...just group games like musical chairs and such.<br/>\nI instituted a new tradition at our church.  I love our church...but I&#39;m<br/>\ncontinually challenging the &#39;way it&#39;s always done&#39; mentality.  Piñatas are<br/>\nfun...but I hate the run and grab all you can method. So I insisted on<br/>\neveryone grabbing what they can and adding it to a big bag. The older kids<br/>\nwere much more likely to let the younger kids &#39;find&#39; some of the treasure to<br/>\nadd to the bag since it wouldn&#39;t take away from their portion.  When all the<br/>\ntreats and treasures are scooped up, the adults or older teens divide the<br/>\nloot evenly into smaller bags for everyone.  The adults thought I was<br/>\ncrazy...but when it was all over, the kids were happy and content.  After<br/>\nseeing this the other adults are like &quot;Wow, what a great idea.....&quot;   We are<br/>\nstill working on some of the other games they want to play...there seems to<br/>\nbe a need to &#39;teach them how to lose&#39; and &#39;teach them they can&#39;t win every<br/>\ntime&#39;.  As if that won&#39;t happen in the course of everyday life.  I&#39;d much<br/>\nrather let them all work together and have fun.  My kids always have the<br/>\noption of sitting out if they don&#39;t want to play so it&#39;s not a big<br/>\ndeal...but little by little, I challenge others to look at the world a bit<br/>\ndifferently.
