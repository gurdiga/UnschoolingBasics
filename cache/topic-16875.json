I really enjoyed the workers or wheels.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBecause my husband is a bi-lateral amputee, he needs really really good<br/>\nhealth insurance to pay for his prosthesis every 2-4 years.

I am hoping that we can do the swap thing (my house<br/>\nfor your rv) so we can experience SOME of the road.  As a one income (I do<br/>\nsome doula work/breastfeeding counseling/education-not enough to make<br/>\nmoney), we can&#39;t really afford to buy an RV so we are getting creative.
