Sam, when he was about <br/>\ntwo, jumped off a table and got a hairline fracture on his tibia. Long after it was healed, he <br/>\nwas unable to walk on it.

Those can be slow to heal, <br/>\nand even after being okay catch you off guard with twinges.

Her mind is connected to that leg and her head is <br/>\ntelling her (and she&#39;s telling you) to keep off it.  My 6 y.o. foster son broke <br/>\nhis leg and was in a cast for 6 weeks. He refused to put weight on it after <br/>\nthe cast had been off for more than a week.  The ortho said it was normal and <br/>\ncommon after a painful injury in a young child.  Its been three weeks and he is <br/>\nnow limping around on it, but still barely putting weight on it. It is his <br/>\nfear of re-injuring his &quot;bad* leg as he calls it that is preventing him from <br/>\nwalking.  It sometimes takes the mind a bit longer to heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do not want to keep carrying her, you might want to try crutches, a <br/>\nwalker, or a wheelchair.  We rented a wheelchair for $75.00/month and it was <br/>\nwell worth it.  I bet she&#39;d love being pushed around by you and her brothers.  <br/>\nYou could turn this into a fun and adventurous memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nRobin, waiting for that update from the x-rays today...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224193221,"authorName":"Tonya Matthews","from":"&quot;Tonya Matthews&quot; &lt;godzilla.matthews@...&gt;","profile":"auburntonya","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Back again re: my 3 1/2 yr old daughter","postDate":"1169691024","msgId":21018,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVwOTNpZytnZ2NjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVwN3ZlaCsxNDZwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21005,"nextInTopic":21059,"prevInTime":21017,"nextInTime":21019,"topicId":20976,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I thank you all for your support.

A sprain would not show up on an x-ray, <br/>\nand can be painful for well over a month. You could try a soak with <br/>\nwarm water to see if that makes her ankle feel better, and even <br/>\nsupport it with an elastic wrap. Just be sure it isn&#39;t too tight, and <br/>\nremove it at night. You might want to consider medicating her with <br/>\nchildren&#39;s tylenol to relieve pain. <br/>\nI remember frequent ankle &#39;twists&#39; from my childhood, and even tho <br/>\nthere was no swelling/bruising, it still hurt. Your daughter needs to <br/>\nknow that you take her seriously, but don&#39;t focus too much attention <br/>\non her injury. Best of luck, and of course, if her ankle isn&#39;t <br/>\nimproving, she needs to see the doctor again, perhaps an orthopedic <br/>\nphysician.<br/>\n<br/>\nFlynnzie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":220015843,"authorName":"Kristie Cochran","from":"Kristie Cochran &lt;kristiecochran@...&gt;","profile":"kristiecochran","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Back again re: my 3 1/2 yr old daughter","postDate":"1169592797","msgId":20980,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ1QjY5MURELjIwODA0MDJAY294Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGVwNjFybCtmaW5pQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVwNjFybCtmaW5pQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20978,"nextInTopic":20984,"prevInTime":20979,"nextInTime":20981,"topicId":20976,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m inclined to believe her.
