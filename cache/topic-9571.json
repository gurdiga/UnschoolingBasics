Just because someone is interested in guns","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-771110829\">**********************************************************<br/>\nHello to the Mom with the son that is interested in guns!<br/>\nJust because someone is interested in guns or weapons of any kind doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean that they are a violent person and certainly not that they will ever become <br/>\nviolent. Violent people are people who are hurting terribly inside for <br/>\nwhatever reason. People are taught violence from other people, not guns or weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hated guns and anything that had to deal with them growing up. (my brothers <br/>\nhunted, EEEK! I HATED that!) My Dad also filled our freezer with animals that <br/>\nwe raised, (to me, at that time, that was worse than guns & hunting) as soon <br/>\nas that took place for the first time, I immediately quit eating meat and <br/>\nbecame a vegetarian at the young age of 10, much to my parents frustration and <br/>\nanger I might add! (Of course, I will admit now, that also may have had a very <br/>\ntiny bit to do with my rebellious tendencies that I had, ok, I mean have&lt;BG&gt;) As <br/>\nI got older though, I decided to get more educated about guns and to my <br/>\nsurprise, I actually started to enjoy shooting them! <br/>\nI have trophies now from competitions and when I met my husband, he was <br/>\nthrilled to learn that I enjoyed the &quot;sport&quot; of shooting also. We now enjoy the <br/>\nsport as a family.<br/>\n<br/>\n I do not hunt and never will, my husband does hunt, we use all of what he <br/>\nbrings home. (I am no longer a vegetarian, I will eat meat, mostly organic and a <br/>\nvery little bit of what my husband brings home, which usually is only one <br/>\ndeer per yr., he doesn&#39;t hunt that often) Our daughters both shoot and are very <br/>\nknowledgeable about guns. Even if I still had the same thoughts about firearms <br/>\nas I did when I was younger, I would still rather they were educated about <br/>\nthem than just say they are &quot;off limits&quot; because of the dangers they do have. I <br/>\nwant them to know those dangers and also how to handle themselves in any <br/>\nsituation when in contact with a firearm. Until just recently, our daughters have <br/>\nboth been to young to hunt. Now, our oldest is getting closer to that age and <br/>\nshe has expressed that she might be interested in hunting. I still SHUDDER at <br/>\nthe thought of myself (or her!) ever killing anything, but if that is what SHE <br/>\nwants, then I will give her my blessings and of course continued support on <br/>\nobtaining the knowledge she needs to be safe and successful. Our youngest also <br/>\nLOVES to shoot but I have a feeling that hunting will not be something in her <br/>\nfuture, she&#39;s like her Mom on that one for sure! (and I&#39;m still not too sure <br/>\nabout my oldest either!:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nFirearms are &quot;dangerous&quot;, ALWAYS, PERIOD.The kids know that when handling a <br/>\nfirearm, no matter what, first and formost :<br/>\n#1: They are ALWAYS LOADED, PERIOD. (even if you &quot;know&quot; that they are not. and<br/>\n#2: YOU NEVER POINT ONE AT ANYTHING THAT YOU DON&#39;T WANT TO KILL!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son is interested in them, my suggestion is (only a suggestion!:o) <br/>\nthat you find a way that will allow him to explore them under your terms, which <br/>\nI&#39;m sure is, safely, you don&#39;t want him to satisfy his curiosity and try to <br/>\nexplore them on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey can become a wonderful sport to take part in, and, like a few have <br/>\nalready mentioned here, they can also be a wonderful learning tool for MANY topics. <br/>\nNot only that, don&#39;t it seem that the &quot;forbidden&quot; fruit is always the one ya <br/>\nwant most?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m loving this group more everyday, many thanks to you, the moderators and <br/>\nthe rest of this group!<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9576,"nextTopicId":9434}}
