The help is always there. Unschooling and mindful parenting  <br/>\nmeans being with your children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I started to figure<br/>\n&gt; some things out and really I am so far behind the curve. No<br/>\n&gt; education, no chance of employment for more than minimum wage. I<br/>\n&gt; never had to do anything. And I never learned to do it until I was<br/>\n&gt; grown and really struggle a lot to learn it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s very easy to look at those who are ahead and feel they have an  <br/>\nadvantage that we wish we already have. And then to resent that we  <br/>\nweren&#39;t given that advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolding onto those feelings leads to unhappiness and frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one has every advantage. Yes, some people *will* need to work  <br/>\nharder to get where they want to go in life. Some people barely had  <br/>\nto work to get As. Some people worked hard to get Cs. Life isn&#39;t  <br/>\nfair. But dwelling on the unfairness doesn&#39;t make it fair. It doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nmove us closer to our goal. All it does is add a layer of sadness to  <br/>\nnot being where we would like to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps lots to look at what you have, than to look at what you  <br/>\ndon&#39;t have. People arrive in America with little money without being  <br/>\nable to speak the language and they make successes of themselves not  <br/>\nby wishing they had what they don&#39;t but by setting their sites on  <br/>\nwhat they want and going after it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying it&#39;s easy. The path of regret and despair is easy but  <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t lead to happiness. The path of putting the past behind and  <br/>\nlooking forward is *hard*, sometimes *very* hard, but it does lead to  <br/>\nhappiness. As long as you are clear on what you want and why you want  <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For me, the times I am happiest is when I excercise self-discipline.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It will help to see how that connects to your childhood, though,  <br/>\nrather than being universally true for everyone. You perhaps equate  <br/>\nlimits -- self imposed or parent imposed -- with loving attention.  <br/>\nUnschoolers offer loving attention in other ways: Real attention:  <br/>\nlistening, being aware, doing things with their child, doing things  <br/>\nthat will bring a smile to a child&#39;s face.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It took me forever to learn any form of it and I have no follow<br/>\n&gt; through most of the time.<br/>\n&gt; I have bounced from one thing to another,<br/>\n&gt; as soon as it is too challenging, or goes to slow, I move on.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There may be some depression involved. There is certainly some damage  <br/>\nfrom your childhood that you&#39;re holding onto. Most of us *do* have  <br/>\nbaggage from childhood, lots of it from school :-/ And it&#39;s amazing  <br/>\nthe amount of time it takes to root it out. Mostly because we don&#39;t  <br/>\neven realize we have these messages in our heads that we assume are  <br/>\ntrue that turn out to not be true.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There are children who do VERY well with no pressure.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some people need *encouragement* to get through difficult parts of  <br/>\nsomething they want to do. The encouragement that will work best will  <br/>\nbe different for each person. It totally depends on personality.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s something we can learn from our children: how much and what  <br/>\nform of encouragement to give them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, though, that if we assume a child needs pushed, that they  <br/>\nwon&#39;t build up the confidence that  they can push themselves. But it  <br/>\ncan be just as bad to completely step away and not offer anything, to  <br/>\nlet the child go it alone. No one advocates that. People on the list  <br/>\nadvocate listening to children and helping them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There are also<br/>\n&gt; some who NEED and WANT structure.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are children who feel comfortable knowing what the day holds.  <br/>\nThey don&#39;t deal well with changes in plan. That doesn&#39;t mean they  <br/>\nwant someone else to structure their life for them and make them  <br/>\nstick to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a difference between (externally imposed or enforced)  <br/>\nstructure and routine. There&#39;s a difference between (externally  <br/>\nimposed or enforced) structure and creating a plan to accomplish a  <br/>\nlarge task.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither routines or plans require a parent to structure a child&#39;s  <br/>\nday. We advocate helping them: help them figure out what they want,  <br/>\nhelp them figure out a way to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s not torture to make a childgo to bed at a certain time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It can be for the child. The archives of Yahoo groups are a lot  <br/>\neasier to search now and you can pull up sad stories adults tell of  <br/>\nbeing made to go to bed when they weren&#39;t sleepy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, helping a child learn to listen to their bodies,  <br/>\ncan help them go to bed when they&#39;re tired.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one advocates removing bedtimes and letting little kids put  <br/>\nthemselves to bed. People here will help others find ways to help  <br/>\ntheir kids transition to sleep, though, without imposing a specific,  <br/>\nby the clock time when kids need to be in bed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s not torture to limit what they eat.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, it can be for the child. There are even more horror stories of  <br/>\nadults who had parents who controlled what they eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you went out for a meal with a friend who was on an unusual diet,  <br/>\nwould you want her to impose limits on what you could order? Many  <br/>\npeople will say a friend is not a parent who is trying to help the  <br/>\nchild make better choices. And yet the feelings are the same  <br/>\n*regardless* of the relationship. A child doesn&#39;t automatically like  <br/>\nhaving choices  taken away from them just because it&#39;s being done by  <br/>\na parent. There are other ways. People can help with ideas if there&#39;s  <br/>\na specific problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It does not mean that you are less of a mother because you<br/>\n&gt; provide a structured enviornment.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t help to grade people with grades as they do in school. And  <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t help to grade people -- less than, more than -- on how  <br/>\nwell they parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut some *ideas* will help people unschool. Some *ideas* will make it  <br/>\nharder to unschool. Some *ideas* will help someone move towards a  <br/>\ngoal and some will make it more difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people personally identify with the choices they&#39;ve made, it makes  <br/>\nit lots harder to let go of ideas and look at the benefits (and  <br/>\ndrawbacks) of new ideas because they don&#39;t want to risk feeling bad  <br/>\nor wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t that conventional parenting doesn&#39;t &quot;work&quot;. It&#39;s that the  <br/>\ngoals are different than mindful parenting. The goals of conventional  <br/>\nparenting are to mold a child into what the parent believes is the  <br/>\nright way to be. Most people we know have been parenting  <br/>\nconventionally some have turned out lousy, some have turned out  <br/>\ngreat, most have some damage but they&#39;ve found ways to overcome or  <br/>\ncope. Conventional parenting &quot;works&quot; to some extent.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are side effects and compromises to conventional parenting  <br/>\nthat must be compensated for. Conventional parenting is, at its  <br/>\nheart, an adversarial relationship. It&#39;s about changing our children  <br/>\nin certain ways to be how we want them to be. So much of conventional  <br/>\nparenting whittles away at our relationship with our children. To  <br/>\ncounteract that, parents need to do even more to rebuild the  <br/>\nrelationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe primary focus of mindful parenting is the relationship we have  <br/>\nwith our child. Mindful parenting is about helping a child, being  <br/>\ntheir partner, trusting that children want to be kind and helping  <br/>\nthem do that. It isn&#39;t ignoring a child&#39;s mistakes. It&#39;s about  <br/>\nhelping them figure out better ways to get what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe people who believe otherwise<br/>\n&gt; will say that it isn&#39;t &quot;unschooling&quot; in its purest form, but who<br/>\n&gt; really cares what other people think or if you fit into their box.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No one should be judging the worth of people here. But we do discuss  <br/>\nthe worth of ideas on how well they will help someone unschool and  <br/>\nhow much they will hinder.<br/>\n<br/>\nConventional parenting makes unschooling more difficult. When we tell  <br/>\nchildren through our actions that we trust them to learn math but  <br/>\ndon&#39;t trust that they want to be kind, don&#39;t trust that they want to  <br/>\nbe safe, don&#39;t trust that they have the abilities to learn how to  <br/>\nlisten to their bodies, we&#39;re sending a double and confusion message.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it doesn&#39;t make any difference what people here think of a person.  <br/>\nWhat *does* matter is what our children think of us. It helps to see  <br/>\nwhat we do and how we treat them as a potential memory that a child  <br/>\nwill take with them into adult hood -- we can&#39;t control what they&#39;ll  <br/>\nremember! -- and to question ourselves if this is what we want to be  <br/>\nremembered for. It helps to see whether a choice we&#39;re about to make  <br/>\nwill help them feel like we&#39;re someone they can bring problems to or  <br/>\nwhether they feel like we&#39;re people who won&#39;t want to hear when  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve done something wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my first reaction to a choice my daughter has made is disapproval,  <br/>\nthen she won&#39;t trust me not to disapprove of her. The more  <br/>\n*confidence* she has that I&#39;ll disapprove, the more likely she&#39;ll  <br/>\nseek out someone -- a friend who has as little experience as she? an  <br/>\nadult who wants to exploit her? -- who will offer sympathy and help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want her confidence that I will offer her sympathy and help. And if  <br/>\nshe&#39;s coming to me, she already knows the choice wasn&#39;t the best! So  <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t need my disapproval. She needs my help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You have to define what works for each child and ultimatley for your<br/>\n&gt; family.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re coming from a childhood where you lacked loving attention  <br/>\nand you&#39;re trying to use limits in order to give what you missed to  <br/>\nyour children, you may be giving them what you needed, rather than  <br/>\nseeing them for their own unique selves.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo often when parents say they are doing what works for their  <br/>\nfamily, what they really mean is what works for the parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I demand respect from my children because I deserve respect<br/>\n&gt; from them. I see other parents who dont&#39; demand respect from their<br/>\n&gt; children and their children, scream, bite, kick, pull hair, all at<br/>\n&gt; their mother.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t demand respect from my daughter and yet she&#39;s respectful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *do* let her know when she&#39;s hurting me. I *do* let her know when  <br/>\nshe&#39;s done something that may have hurt another. And I treat her with  <br/>\nrespect.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we approach our kids with the assumption that they&#39;ve done  <br/>\nsomething because they&#39;re mean or bad, they&#39;re far less likely to  <br/>\nhear what we have to say. If we approach them assuming they&#39;re doing  <br/>\nthe best that they can and that they don&#39;t have the skills or  <br/>\nunderstanding to make it work, then we can turn to *helping* them do  <br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich person would you rather listen to: someone who assumed you did  <br/>\nsomething deliberately, or someone who assumed you just don&#39;t yet  <br/>\nunderstand?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Again, not all children react this way and some learn<br/>\n&gt; respect different ways. YOu know your child.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>People who have tried conventional parenting and then switched to  <br/>\nmindful parenting can tell you better that their children respond to  <br/>\nrespect much better than to conventional parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou grew up with neglect. You&#39;re now using conventional parenting.  <br/>\nNeither of those is what unschoolers mean when they talk about no rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My children would not treat me with disdain or get away with<br/>\n&gt; behaviour like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nor would my daughter. And without conventional parenting or  <br/>\ndiscipline or rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *help* her figure out a better way when she is confused. She  <br/>\n*wants* to figure out a better way. She doesn&#39;t want to hurt people.  <br/>\nIt would create a rift in our relationship if I assumed she wanted to  <br/>\nhurt others. That would say to her that I didn&#39;t understand her at  <br/>\nall.

It sounds like while you feel you had no limitations, you<br/>\nalso were lacking in mindful parenting.  This is the only portion of<br/>\nyour post that I saved because I think that this is something that you<br/>\nreally need to consider in comparing your childhood to that of an<br/>\nunschooled childhood.  My children have very few limitations.  I say<br/>\nvery few because I do ask them to tell me where they are going and<br/>\nwhen they will be back and to carry their cell phone with them and<br/>\nthat I know who they are with - these are all things a mindful parent<br/>\ndoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe repeat this mantra often on this list &quot;Unschooling is not<br/>\nunparenting.&quot;  Children who do not have forced bedtimes, controlled<br/>\nfood, have the freedom to pursue their passions *and* have *mindful<br/>\nparticipating* parents will find their self-control.  On their own<br/>\nwith you there to help them if they are stumbling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example:  My son Keon (8yo) has a difficult time distinguishing<br/>\nthings such as being tired, confused, overworked, etc.  He will work<br/>\non a video game for 12+ hours some days and just get into fits because<br/>\nhe can&#39;t beat this &quot;boss&quot; or is stuck trying to figure out where some<br/>\nkey is.  He will get angry to the point where he throws things or<br/>\nyells or cries.  At first this behaviour upset me, but then I realized<br/>\nthis was how he worked things out but at the same time he *needed*  ME<br/>\nto help him realize that he needs to take breaks and come back more<br/>\nrefreshed.  I got this message loud and clear when I started sitting<br/>\nin the same room watching him play the games.  Watching his life.<br/>\nBeing aware of his needs.  I help he by suggesting things like, &quot;Wow,<br/>\nthis is really difficult.  It&#39;s making me dizzy.  I was thinking of<br/>\ngoing and getting a cup of ice cream and sitting on the front step.<br/>\nCare to join me?&quot;  or &quot;You seem very frustrated with this boss.  He<br/>\nmust be a really tough cookie.  Why don&#39;t we go take a walk around in<br/>\nthe garden and talk about what is so tough about this boss?  I bet<br/>\nwhen you come in you can get past him.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of self discipline is learning about what your body needs and<br/>\nmeeting those needs.  It&#39;s not about picking up your room, eating all<br/>\nyour veggies, doing a task list of chores, toeing the line, or having<br/>\nto say yes ma&#39;am and no sir.  And children will learn to respect other<br/>\npeople (not just their parents) when they are met with respect and<br/>\nhave parents who are interested in their lives.  Were your parents<br/>\ninterested in your life?  It sounds like not if you went to such<br/>\nextremes as getting pregnant at a young age.  I&quot;m sure there were<br/>\nother incidents in your life where you were screaming LOOK AT ME<br/>\nthrough your actions but not getting the *respect* that you were<br/>\nneeding.  The attention you deserved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there will be others who have been living joyful unschooled<br/>\nlives longer than I have who will chime in.  Your children will not<br/>\nturn out like you if you don&#39;t act like your parents.  BTW, Keon today<br/>\nwas battling Hades (Lord of the  Dead, thank you very much) and having<br/>\na fit.  I was reading a book in another room and he came to me and<br/>\nsighed.  I asked, &quot;Tough day?&quot;  He said, &quot;Hades is really making me<br/>\nangry, so I thought I would take a break and see if that would help.&quot;<br/>\nNow his break was only the time it took him to walk down the hall,<br/>\nsigh at me and walk back.  Maybe that was all he needed right now, but<br/>\nhe is starting to recognize those things and act on them.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to think what he would be like if I didn&#39;t take the time to be<br/>\nmindful of his needs, wants and dreams.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"freedom vs. neglect","postDate":"1153178604","msgId":15817,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5aDY1YytrOHZ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15818,"prevInTime":15816,"nextInTime":15818,"topicId":15817,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am bringing this post to the list under my name, though none of this is my writing.

I crossed<br/>\nevery line I could think of to get my parents to notice me and to<br/>\nprotect me from myself. I was pregnant at 17 and scared to death.<br/>\nThat didn&#39;t work either. After trying miserably for YEARS to get<br/>\nsomone to tell me how to get through life, at 23 I started to figure<br/>\nsome things out and really I am so far behind the curve. No<br/>\neducation, no chance of employment for more than minimum wage. I<br/>\nnever had to do anything. And I never learned to do it until I was<br/>\ngrown and really struggle a lot to learn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, the times I am happiest is when I excercise self-discipline.<br/>\nIt took me forever to learn any form of it and I have no follow<br/>\nthrough most of the time. I have bounced from one thing to another,<br/>\nas soon as it is too challenging, or goes to slow, I move on. Except<br/>\nwith my children whom I do follow through with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are children who do VERY well with no pressure. There are also<br/>\nsome who NEED and WANT structure. It&#39;s not torture to make a child<br/>\ngo to bed at a certain time. It&#39;s not torture to limit what they<br/>\neat. It does not mean that you are less of a mother because you<br/>\nprovide a structured enviornment. Maybe people who believe otherwise<br/>\nwill say that it isn&#39;t &quot;unschooling&quot; in its purest form, but who<br/>\nreally cares what other people think or if you fit into their box.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to define what works for each child and ultimatley for your<br/>\nfamily. I demand respect from my children because I deserve respect<br/>\nfrom them. I see other parents who dont&#39; demand respect from their<br/>\nchildren and their children, scream, bite, kick, pull hair, all at<br/>\ntheir mother. Again, not all children react this way and some learn<br/>\nrespect different ways. YOu know your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t spank, but I really do mean what I say.<br/>\nMy children would not treat me with disdain or get away with<br/>\nbehaviour like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also a human being and deserving of happiness also. And that<br/>\nmeans we all have to learn to respect one another and follow rules<br/>\nthat make life manageble to everyone in the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do my best to give them space, watch them learn, hear what they<br/>\nhave to say, and do what we believe is best for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think what you are doing now is working and is in the best<br/>\ninterest of your family, then I would absolutely support you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am just suggesting that if its not working maybe trying something<br/>\nnew would bring about different results. Maybe he is acting out to<br/>\nsee if you care enough or are strong enough to stand up to him. To<br/>\nme he sounds angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son doesn&#39;t know what to expect. Sometimes he misbehaves and<br/>\nyou say nothing or just remind him. Sometimes he gets yelled at. It<br/>\nall depends on how short your wire is that day. Sounds like the<br/>\nconsequesnes for his misbehaviour are that he gets yelled at and<br/>\nthreatened. So he is getting consequences. Why not try setting<br/>\nconsequences BEFORE you loose your cool. He gets them anyway. And<br/>\nchange the consequences. Maybe try making him clean up his own mess.<br/>\nYou know your child and what will get through to him. It might take<br/>\na while, but consistency works.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe careful that chaos isn&#39;t equated with freedom. The two can be<br/>\nvery different and bring about very different results.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15931,"nextTopicId":15932}}
