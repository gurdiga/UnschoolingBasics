I&#39;m in complete and utter awe at this whole<br/>\nexperience thus far and especially how Nature has worked. Each bird is<br/>\ndeveloping at it&#39;s own pace, what would happen if I purposely pulled<br/>\non the feathers of the smalleset bird in order to bring out the<br/>\nprettier ones so that it could be up to par with its siblings?<br/>\nCertainly, I would be told that I was being cruel and inhumane, how<br/>\nsilly for you to try and make that other bird catch up! Yet, each day<br/>\nmillions of schooled children are told that because they are not up<br/>\nwith their peers that they are slow and/or behind. Its not just the<br/>\nschools doing that either, many times, parents the whole world over<br/>\nbereat their children for not being able to keep up with their peers,<br/>\nsome will make their children feel guilty, others will beat themselves<br/>\nup as parents and others will do both.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly in the school years do people forget that we humans are part of<br/>\nnature too. All of a sudden we are plucking and pulling on their<br/>\nfeathers, trying deseperately to get them to be up to par with other<br/>\nhuman children and making themselves and their children feel like<br/>\nfailures. Children need room to grow, we need to let go and relax and<br/>\nenjoy seeing in which direction nature wants them to go and give them<br/>\nthe freedom to enjoy their own INDIVIDUAL developments and give them<br/>\nwhat they need in order to do so. If children are allowed to develop<br/>\nnaturally, with a loving parent or guardian by their side, helping<br/>\nthem along the way when they ask for help, they will thrive...even if<br/>\nthey don&#39;t know or care to know the specific dates of war or how to<br/>\ndiagram a sentence.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot everything is a tree, not everything is a flower, not everything<br/>\nis a lake or ocean or weed or grass but all of these things are<br/>\nimportant in our world and have a different function..and just like<br/>\nthe rest of nature....we people serve different functions as well.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12195,"nextTopicId":12204}}
