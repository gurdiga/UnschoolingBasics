By 10 pm everybody needs to be doing something quiet in their room.  Usually my 7 yr old ends up reading a story to her two brothers, and I put the one yr old to sleep in my bedroom.

This time was very<br/>\nprecious to me. I explained this to my dc, 7 & 9 and they totally<br/>\nunderstood. We came up with the solution that when it got to be about 10:00<br/>\nI would ask them to go get ready for bed but they knew that that didn&#39;t mean<br/>\nthey had to go to bed. They stayed up and watched TV or played comp. games,<br/>\nread, played in their rooms, etc. They always tried to be quiet. After a few<br/>\nweeks of this I got comfortable enough to go to sleep when they were still<br/>\nup (they are both night owls and I&#39;m not). We talked a lot about safety<br/>\nissues too. About sex- With dh working nights, the only time we could have<br/>\nsex was during the day. We waited until they were busy with their own things<br/>\nand told them we&#39;d be in our room if they needed us (they only came knocking<br/>\na couple of times). We turned on the TV or the radio just enough, but so<br/>\nthat we could still hear them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would think that if you talk to your son about the time you and dh need<br/>\ntogether he would understand and be very supportive. It will take some time<br/>\nfor you to feel comfortable and maybe some tweaking. Talk about safety<br/>\nissues a lot too. Maybe buy a baby monitor until you feel more comfortable.<br/>\nChildren have an amazing capacity to understand and have sympathy for our<br/>\nconcerns, especially if approached in the right way. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPS-Dh started working days just last week for the first time in 2 years. He<br/>\nwas surprised to find out that the kids didn&#39;t have a bed time. I was very<br/>\nhappy when we all transitioned so well. The kids were used to going to their<br/>\nrooms to do quiet activities and I realized that they enjoyed this time to<br/>\nunwind as much as I did. <br/>\n<br/>\nHTH,<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy DS is 10 and we&#39;ve been unschooling for about 2 mths.

I believe in unschooling and think that my children are happier and are learning more than they ever would in a very structured enviornment.  I also feel that unschooling is different for every family  and you have to find the balance for your family and if our children ever begin to ask about a later bedtime then we as a family would discuss it and as a family we would have to discuss what is best for all of us including me and my husband.
