I Do spend a lot of time with the kids, but my mind certainly is on other things, for the most part.  When at home, I find it hard to drop things (although I do!) and get involved in the kids&#39; activites.  To combat this, I remove myself from the home a LOT.  Lots of outings, so I am both physically and mentally removed from &#39;tempation&#39; - to do the dishes, vacuum, etc.  This works to everyones benefit.  My house is a mess . . . to my standards, anyway.  Unschooling helped me a looong time ago to shift my perspective on the value of household duties, and I undertake it happily.  But it&#39;s still there!    <br/>\n<br/>\nDeeper that the actual &#39;doing&#39; of stuff, I have this constant internal chatter about how much I need to &#39;be&#39; with the kids; truly present, for unschooling to really reach that level of &#39;success&#39;.  There are moments when I am truly &#39;with&#39; them.  It&#39;s like meditation; when you are aware you are &#39;doing it&#39;, you&#39;re out if it!  I literally tell myself, &#39;be present, be present&#39;.  It all kinda feels false/forced?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- If knowledge alone were enough to let go of a need/fear/goal that was interfering with another goal, no one would be eating to excess,  <br/>\navoiding exercise, continuing to smoke, procrastinating.

I often think, if I have the knowledge, then what&#39;s the problem?  Application should be easy, if you have a sound understanding of the &#39;why&#39;.

The absolute truth is that you do<br/>\nhave more power than your kids.  It&#39;s a fact.

So some of the recognizing that you<br/>\nare more powerful is a societal and age thing.  A construct of the culture<br/>\nwe live in.  You can&#39;t take the blame for that.

In<br/>\n&gt; this model there are high power members and low power members.  Since we are<br/>\n&gt; talking about families, we&#39;d say that traditionally, the parents are the<br/>\n&gt; high power members and the children are the low power members, regardless of<br/>\n&gt; age.  A high power member is someone who has the capacity to have<br/>\n&gt; considerable influence on another&#39;s outcomes.  A low power member has very<br/>\n&gt; little influence on another&#39;s outcomes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More than this, high power members (keep in mind here your {the rhetorical<br/>\n&gt; you} relationships with your kids and parents etc..) have lives that seem<br/>\n&gt; generally very good.  Everything seems to go well, every problem is easily<br/>\n&gt; solved and everyone seems to like and appreciate them.  High power members<br/>\n&gt; do not deal well or benevolently when this is disrupted by a low power<br/>\n&gt; member.  (Hence why grandmothers don&#39;t like it when their children don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; parent their grandkids the way they think it should be done.)  When low<br/>\n&gt; power members express dissatisfaction, high power members attempt to protect<br/>\n&gt; their superior power by rejecting demands for change and being uninterested<br/>\n&gt; in learning about the intentions and plans of low power members, being<br/>\n&gt; inattentive to the communications of the low power person and being<br/>\n&gt; unresponsive to cooperative gestures by the low power members.  They usually<br/>\n&gt; are hard to move toward cooperation, conciliation and compromise, and they<br/>\n&gt; will largely ignore the efforts of their low power individuals to increase<br/>\n&gt; cooperative problem solving.  They attempt to protect their superior power<br/>\n&gt; by rejecting demands for change.  High power individuals tend to be more<br/>\n&gt; angered by a lower power person&#39;s harm or insult than when positions are<br/>\n&gt; reversed.  Aristotle said &quot;people think it right that they should be revered<br/>\n&gt; by those inferior to them.&quot;   And high power persons find it particularly<br/>\n&gt; vexing to be insulted or harmed by someone who should actually treat them<br/>\n&gt; with deference.  To them low power persons do not &quot;know their place&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; insist on &quot;rocking the boat&quot; out of ignorance and spite.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once a group member gains power, they tend to establish regulations and<br/>\n&gt; norms to legitimize their position and privileges and make illegitimate any<br/>\n&gt; attempt by others to change the status quo.  This strategy can be defined as<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;power defines justice&quot; strategy or the &quot;might makes right&quot; strategy.<br/>\n&gt; In addition, high power members tend to make the risk of attempting to<br/>\n&gt; change the power status quo so great that low power members are deterred<br/>\n&gt; from trying to do so.  They do so in two ways: by establishing severe<br/>\n&gt; penalties for those who attempt to change the status quo and by offering low<br/>\n&gt; power members a variety of benefits as long as they do not rebel.  The<br/>\n&gt; latter seems to be more effective.  The severe penalties strategy may be<br/>\n&gt; characterized as the &quot;this-hurts-me-more-than-it-will-hurt-you&quot;strategy or<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;if-only-you-would-behave-neither-of-us-would-go-through-this-suffering&quot;<br/>\n&gt; strategy.  The benefits strategy would be bribing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, the power-devaluation theory rolls in here because it posits that as a<br/>\n&gt; person&#39;s power increases, they will make more attempts to influence others.<br/>\n&gt; As more influence attempts are made, the person comes to believe that they<br/>\n&gt; can control the lower power peoples&#39; behavior and is the causal agent in<br/>\n&gt; producing the outcomes.  The performances of low power people are devalued<br/>\n&gt; and the high powered person takes responsibility for any successes<br/>\n&gt; associated with the work of the lower power members.  Also high power<br/>\n&gt; members tend to devalue low power members and this is reflected in them<br/>\n&gt; being uninterested in learning about the intentions and plans of low power<br/>\n&gt; members, less cooperative and more exploitative in response to the low power<br/>\n&gt; members&#39; cooperation and less likely to make concessions in negotiations.<br/>\n&gt; High power members also see themselves as being entitled to a larger share<br/>\n&gt; of available resources due to their superior value.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So in a traditional family we can see that parents expect kids to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;toe-the-line&quot; and to react very badly when they do not.  And while parents<br/>\n&gt; can and do come up with all kinds of reasons why they have to do what they<br/>\n&gt; do (ie: a spanking for not sitting quietly during dinner because they have<br/>\n&gt; to learn manners) the real reason is that they are reacting to the challenge<br/>\n&gt; to their authority by a member they consider lower power and less valuable<br/>\n&gt; than themselves.  I know when I came to this realization that this is what I<br/>\n&gt; was REALLY doing to my kids and not any of the benevolent horse-pucky I was<br/>\n&gt; convinced I was doing it for I had no choice but to change my behavior<br/>\n&gt; because there was no way I could look into the face of my children and say<br/>\n&gt; in my head &quot;You are not worth as much as I am.&quot;  It was a powerful and<br/>\n&gt; painful revelation.  Once I had this idea firmly in my head.  I could see<br/>\n&gt; how my interactions with other members of my family, my parents, in-laws<br/>\n&gt; etc...were really about power and who expected what.  It was much easier to<br/>\n&gt; move around, and in some cases through, these issues because I knew what the<br/>\n&gt; motivation was behind the conflicts even if the other person didn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And further, I knew that the lessons I wanted my kids to learn were not<br/>\n&gt; about manners or forks, or seat belts.  I wanted them to learn respect and<br/>\n&gt; value and the ability to value others for who they were, and not to see<br/>\n&gt; people in terms of a power value.  The ONLY way that was going to happen was<br/>\n&gt; to stop seeing us a members with differential power bases.  Because that is<br/>\n&gt; not a lesson one can learn from teaching...it has to be modeled.  And I knew<br/>\n&gt; I had to model it for the rest of my kids&#39; lives, (or mine I guess) in order<br/>\n&gt; for it to be an authentic message.  I had to live the way I wanted the world<br/>\n&gt; to work, at least for my family if not for the world at large.  In the end,<br/>\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t matter if the dish is put in the dishwasher...and it is NOT a<br/>\n&gt; challenge to my authority (either real or imagined) if it&#39;s not put in the<br/>\n&gt; dishwasher.

Since we are ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-399437314\">This whole thread reminds me of the conflict model of social influence.  In<br/>\nthis model there are high power members and low power members.  Since we are<br/>\ntalking about families, we&#39;d say that traditionally, the parents are the<br/>\nhigh power members and the children are the low power members, regardless of<br/>\nage.  A high power member is someone who has the capacity to have<br/>\nconsiderable influence on another&#39;s outcomes.  A low power member has very<br/>\nlittle influence on another&#39;s outcomes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore than this, high power members (keep in mind here your {the rhetorical<br/>\nyou} relationships with your kids and parents etc..) have lives that seem<br/>\ngenerally very good.  Everything seems to go well, every problem is easily<br/>\nsolved and everyone seems to like and appreciate them.  High power members<br/>\ndo not deal well or benevolently when this is disrupted by a low power<br/>\nmember.  (Hence why grandmothers don&#39;t like it when their children don&#39;t<br/>\nparent their grandkids the way they think it should be done.)  When low<br/>\npower members express dissatisfaction, high power members attempt to protect<br/>\ntheir superior power by rejecting demands for change and being uninterested<br/>\nin learning about the intentions and plans of low power members, being<br/>\ninattentive to the communications of the low power person and being<br/>\nunresponsive to cooperative gestures by the low power members.  They usually<br/>\nare hard to move toward cooperation, conciliation and compromise, and they<br/>\nwill largely ignore the efforts of their low power individuals to increase<br/>\ncooperative problem solving.  They attempt to protect their superior power<br/>\nby rejecting demands for change.  High power individuals tend to be more<br/>\nangered by a lower power person&#39;s harm or insult than when positions are<br/>\nreversed.  Aristotle said &quot;people think it right that they should be revered<br/>\nby those inferior to them.&quot;   And high power persons find it particularly<br/>\nvexing to be insulted or harmed by someone who should actually treat them<br/>\nwith deference.

The issue was that I really didn&#39;t (and sometimes still don&#39;t) believe that I was was good enough. <br/>\nI never wanted my kids to ever worry about what others thought. I didn&#39;t know how I could stop worrying about other&#39;s opinions, and so I passed on those feelings of not being good enough and trying to be perfect to them. We are all slowly learning to stand up for ourselves and our principles.<br/>\nIn our case it took a huge family problem to give my husband and I the kick in the pants we needed to stop living for others and to start living for ourselves and our kids. We resolved to stop pretending and start being upfront with people. If they didn&#39;t like it they didn&#39;t have to be around us. I still have one or two family members who think grades are the only things that matter in life. (One of them in particular thinks Facebook and online banking will ruin you life forever.)

This afternoon she started falling asleep in the car at 4pm (which made perfect sense for her) but I got angry about it because I arranged for us to drive to visit relatives tomorrow and I fear what they would think of me (as a parent and a person) if we are both exhausted from staying up late (which tends to happen if she naps in the afternoon). I sometimes try to coerce her to wear a clean shirt or put on shoes, simply because of what others might think, when I honestly don&#39;t think it&#39;s important and I trust her to do what she needs to now. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why is what they think so important to you? I have had to ask myself that question more times that I would like to admit. How will your relatives know that you were deliberately up late? If you are exhausted, can&#39;t you just say, &quot;We had a rough night&quot; and leave it at that. I find that I can avoid a lot of questions and judgment by minimizing how much detail I share with others. Even mainstream moms have had days where kids have fallen asleep in the car, which resulted in a later bed time. A lot of that kind of thing can be avoided by advance planning. We don&#39;t go out before noon so that everyone can sleep until they are ready to wake up. If I know the kids are going to fall asleep in the car and I don&#39;t want them to, I try to find ways to avoid the car all together. If my daughter doesn&#39;t want to put on a clean shirt, I think about where we are going and how necessary it is for her to have on a clean shirt. I have found that keeping outings to later in the day allows my kids to go out without putting on the clean shirt. For some reason, if you are out late in the day, people don&#39;t look twice at a kid with a dirty shirt. Also, I carry extra clothes with me in the car so I can change their clothes if necessary. Also, it gives me an out because I can always tell people, &quot;I have a clean shirt in the diaper bag/car&quot; if somebody expresses concern. I really doubt that a stranger would pry that much. If they do, then you can ignore them or simply walk away. I have gotten really good and smiling and nodding or pretending that I didn&#39;t hear what they were saying. I always have a pair of shoes in the car so that I can put them in my purse or carry them if we are going somewhere that requires shoes. If anybody says anything or looks twice, I can point to the shoes sticking out of the bag. : -)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I can see the effects of my anger is to give a powerful message about her not being acceptable / worthy, and that she&#39;d better do what I expect and do it before I get angry (i.e., anticipate what might bother me and do what will please me). That, I can now see, is what I experienced as a child, and I continue to go on trying to anticipate and meet expectations and avoid judgement, even though I very much have chosen my own path, it&#39;s something I struggle with a lot. I really don&#39;t want to give dd this message, I want to raise her fully free and loved, unlike how I was raised. argh!&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You cannot avoid judgment. Even mainstream parents that use coercive techniques to get their children to comply are judged. As a parent, you will constantly be judged by everyone around you no matter what path you have chosen. There will always be somebody that disagrees with what you are doing no matter what your choices are. I don&#39;t think that it is possible to be truly free. Instead of putting that kind of pressure on my child, we avoid places that require them to act beyond their years. If we do go, then we always build in a back up plan. For example, I will only take all 4 kids shopping if I have another adult with me because I never know when my 20 month old or 3 year old will get tired and want to run. When that happens, the other adult can take the kids to the car so they can snack and play in the car. We don&#39;t take the two little ones to restaurants or any other place where people will expect them to behave or be quiet. I can take my older two (6 &9) pretty much anywhere because we talk about the behavioral expectations beforehand. When we went to see my dad in a play, they knew that they had to dress a certain way and behave a certain way at the theater. If they did not want to dress appropriately or be courteous, then they would have had the option of not going. If visiting family members is too stressful for you or your child, then don&#39;t do it. Give yourself permission to say yes to your child and no to the rest of the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":443205829,"authorName":"cathy_jerad_adela","from":"&quot;cathy_jerad_adela&quot; &lt;livinglovingchrist@...&gt;","profile":"cathy_jerad_adela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: dealing with my anger / others&#39; expectations","postDate":"1284721307","msgId":44816,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk2dmhxcis3aDFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk2cWo4aStsMGlzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44776,"nextInTopic":44817,"prevInTime":44815,"nextInTime":44817,"topicId":44774,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks to those that replied about handling anger better.
