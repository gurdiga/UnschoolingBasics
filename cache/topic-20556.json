I am an unschooling dad and a dental hygienist.<br/>\n1. stinky breath<br/>\nthe scientific side says this come from sulfer producing bacteria, you <br/>\nhave almost 500 different types of microorganisms living in your mouth <br/>\n( read we are all earth mothers) some give off a lot of sulfer as waste <br/>\nproducts after eating what ever your eating. to limit the stink limit <br/>\nthe germies. the biggest area is your tongue and rest of your mouth <br/>\ncavity, so brush your tongue and the cheeks and whatever else feels not <br/>\ntoo intrusive. the stinky breath clnics just have instruments to <br/>\npinpoint where the most sulfer is eminating from and basically just <br/>\ngently rub the area with the equivilant of a plastic throw away knife, .<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthe stuff about the disease internally being caused by mouth born <br/>\naccess has been a bit over blown. <br/>\n I t was a hot idea as the micro organisms do have some access at the <br/>\nbase of the gums surrounding the teeth. every time you brush your teeth <br/>\nmicro organisms do circulate throughout your blood hiways. but the idea <br/>\nof this causing internal damage to organs has not really been so <br/>\nsupported with further research. Now dentists like propaganda that gets <br/>\nmore cash to them and tend not to bother following up on the most part, <br/>\nso as with many things once something ( ideas) get in circulation it is <br/>\nhard to root them out. <br/>\n<br/>\nfluoride; well there is controversy still with this , the incidence did <br/>\ngo down as more fluoride was introduced into water supplies , but it <br/>\nwent down in many other places where this was not happening meaning <br/>\nother countries. so corelation doesn&#39;t have to mean causation as the <br/>\nstatistics people say. ( can&#39;t resist saying &quot; people use statistics <br/>\nwhen they aren&#39;t comfortable enough that their ideas can hold the sway&quot;)<br/>\nnow I do use fluoride and even rinses but I&#39;m a hypocrit in too many <br/>\nvenues of my life. <br/>\nthey ask you if you want fluoride at the dentist office becuase you <br/>\nhave to pay for it. that treatment is no where as effective of a <br/>\ndelivery system as just buying a bottle of act or such at the <br/>\nsupermarket; many kids have upset stomachs by it , as fluoride is also <br/>\na rat poison ( hyerbole). <br/>\nout o pennies<br/>\n patrick</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20535,"nextTopicId":20714}}
