I don&#39;t think a toddler standing at a booth is a big deal, I<br/>\npersonally don&#39;t try to stop my kids unless it is potentially<br/>\ndangerous or bothering other people (unless those other people are<br/>\nbothered by just about everything...then I say &quot;to hell with it&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you ask folks that ate out with me at the first two conferences,<br/>\nthey&#39;ll probably tell you they never really ate WITH me!! I followed<br/>\nJalen around the restaurant pointing at pictures and trying to keep<br/>\nhim happily distracted. He never actually sat to eat. I would come by<br/>\nthe table on a walk-about and grab some food for myself. Snatching 2-3<br/>\nbites at a time is how I survived.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just didn&#39;t eat out much at all when he was younger. He still<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t sit through a whole meal, which at home is no big deal. On the<br/>\nrare occasions we go out, he always ends up without shoes on, either<br/>\nhiding under the table or walking around the table. We just make sure<br/>\nhe isn&#39;t out in the aisles, but right near us. I am still amazed that<br/>\nI can actually sit and eat a meal now.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15897,"nextTopicId":15923}}
