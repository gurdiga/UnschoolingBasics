That&#39;s confusing when talking about something like radical unschooling where individual differences matter. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some families where, in terms of food, &quot;we&quot; is easier - some families seem to be more compatible in terms of dietary needs than others. Its important to recognize that there are other families where there&#39;s no &quot;we&quot; where diet is concerned. <br/>\n<br/>\n My kids, for instance, have vastly different diets. Currently they reflect the differences between a young man who has always been easy going where food is concerned, and a young girl who has a veeeeeerrrry conservative diet and very small apetite! Its challenging to meet the dietary needs and wants and wishes of all of my family members on a slim budget, it takes some creativity, but its doable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I have offended in any way, I am sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anyone has been offended. The main issue is that you&#39;ve presented a lot of &quot;we&quot; decisions that include your kids, without talking about how that happens, How the natural interests and curiosity of children to try what they see - on tv, at others homes, in grocery stores - play out amidst that &quot;we&quot;. No-one is necessarily challenging your parenting, but its not in the least bit clear how it relates to radical unschooling, and radical unschooling is what this list is about. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42625,"nextTopicId":3454}}
