That helped us feel more like partners, rather than me trying to &quot;teach&quot; him how to unschool. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That was a big turning point for me. When I first discovered deliberate, whole life unschooling, I was so excited about it that I got a little over zealous. In the process, I was trying to apply it without really thinking about things. I was overconfident and came across as a bit of a know it all. My husband and I were talking about this the other night. He said that he never said anything because he didn&#39;t have any knowledge to draw from. He felt like he couldn&#39;t do anything right and my attitude didn&#39;t help. Once I took a step back and tried to explain my process to my husband, things go so much better. I told him that the easiest way for me to move towards intentional unschooling was to always ask myself why. Then, we worked it out where he became comfortable enough for me to ask him why in the moment when the kids are around. If he said something to the kids, I would ask him to explain it to the kids so that I wasn&#39;t contradicting him but I was also helping the kids understand him.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I can ask him why and he will say, &quot;I don&#39;t know. Forget I said anything.&quot; (Of course, he will be grinning from ear to ear now because we both get it.) That has also helped to empower the kids so that they are comfortable asking us questions. If I am doing something that makes no sense at all, my kids will ask me why. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband really helped me get through a tough week this past week. I was helping with a family member and the kids were jealous. I went out for a couple hours one night and that aggravated the kids and their behavior went into a downward spiral. I got mad and whiny and started acting like the kids were punishing me for going out. (I know, not very grown up of me.) My husband stopped me and did a recap of everything that the kids and I had dealt with all week. He pointed out the change in routine, the change of eating, the added stress, and all of the other little things. He was able to recount the little things because I had told him about them during the course of the week. By the time he was done, I no longer felt guilty for going out. I thanked him profusely for keeping me in check. I had to enlist his help in a non-condescending, non-parental way before we ever made any progress. We both have our bad days but instead of correcting each other, we try to help each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":431370813,"authorName":"atvannoy","from":"&quot;atvannoy&quot; &lt;atvannoy@...&gt;","profile":"atvannoy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Was I wrong?

Dh has his own relationships with the kids, even if he doesn&#39;t always word things or feel things as kind as I&#39;d hope.  (And he is kind many times.  And I can be short sometimes too...so I do keep that in mind.  And I keep in mind how tired he might be or that he may feel overwhelmed with much to do at home after a long day at work, etc, etc.  I need to be as thoughtful with his feelings as I am with others and keep in mind he is doing his best and that he loves them.)  Anyway, I do notice that when I attempt to explain to the kids that Daddy would like them to do or not do something and give the reasons in a kind way, I notice that my husband might next time explain things a little gentler.  He still might not be as thoughtful with his words as I wish all the time, but each time one makes a step in a kind direction, it helps to make our lives more peaceful and then the kids not only have a good role model of peaceful communication, but they can better understand why he feels the way he does more easily (because when you feel at ease, not stressed or accused, you can more easily listen to others).

It&#39;s *not*  <br/>\nentirely radical unschooling friendly but has lots of good tips in it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut say this is like one of the few things that&#39;s like nails on  <br/>\nchalkboard to him, your husband could have said in a pleasant, jolly  <br/>\nvoice, &quot;Hey, bud, that sound bothers me. Would you mind chewing with  <br/>\nyour mouth closed?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few ways that might go.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he were an always respected child, it&#39;s likely he would do the best  <br/>\nhe could to keep his mouth closed because since people have always  <br/>\ntaken his feelings into consideration, accommodating when he&#39;s asked,  <br/>\nhe&#39;d want to treat them with respect also. But once his mind wandered  <br/>\noff to other thoughts -- very likely with a 5 yo -- he&#39;d probably  <br/>\nforget! Which *is* the best he could do. If you think of it as a  <br/>\ntemporary handicap that will correct with age, the response is either  <br/>\nto learn to not let the sound be irritating or leave the room. If he&#39;s  <br/>\nasked again next time and the same thing happens, best to live with it  <br/>\nuntil he&#39;s older and has more awareness of what he&#39;s doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n*But* even respected children are aware of the differences in power  <br/>\nbetween adults and kids. From kids&#39; points of view, you and your  <br/>\nhusband have a huge amount of power. Whatever you want, you have the  <br/>\npower (money, mobility, authority) to go get. Obviously not entirely  <br/>\ntrue, but compared to his power over the things he wants in life, it  <br/>\nis true. You have a craving for McDonald&#39;s, you can hop in the car and  <br/>\ngo. You want a new book, same. You want hot dogs for dinner, you have  <br/>\nthe power to get them and make them. Pretty much everything he wants  <br/>\nhe needs to go through you or your husband and then wait for your  <br/>\ndecision and then for a time that isn&#39;t too troublesome for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, chewing with his mouth open when he&#39;s been told it bothers someone  <br/>\ncan feel like power. To a 5 yo to be able to control the feelings of  <br/>\nan adult who has power over his body and feelings is huge!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the response could be to turn it into a game of who can make the  <br/>\nmost noise. :-) And then to be very aware of helping him feel more  <br/>\npowerful in his world. Find ways he can do things for himself. Be  <br/>\naware of how often you&#39;re saying no or later when it could be done  <br/>\nright away.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it sounds like your son was conventionally parented up until now.  <br/>\nUp until now his feelings have been treated with disrespect and he&#39;s  <br/>\ntreating you the way you&#39;ve modeled for him. Would you tell a friend  <br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t chew with your mouth open?&quot; Would you then say &quot;What did I tell  <br/>\nyou?&quot; We treat kids in ways that we know would lose friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with that analogy is that most people have grown up with  <br/>\nparents modeling, &quot;Don&#39;t chew with your mouth open!&quot; as a way of  <br/>\nletting someone know something bothers us. And we know we don&#39;t like  <br/>\nthat said to us and we know we don&#39;t want to use it on friends. But no  <br/>\none&#39;s ever modeled anything else so we don&#39;t know what to do! So we  <br/>\ndon&#39;t say anything. And then complain to other friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo better for your son :-) Model for him ways he can let a friend know  <br/>\nsomething&#39;s bothering him. *For now* -- and this is what makes this  <br/>\nnew way confusing for people because it seems like it isn&#39;t working --  <br/>\nwhen you ask politely he will *hear* &quot;Don&#39;t chew with your mouth  <br/>\nopen!&quot; It will sound just like a different form of command. He will  <br/>\nassume his choices are obedience or disobedience. *Eventually* when  <br/>\nhe&#39;s filled full to overflowing with respect, he will *feel* that his  <br/>\nchoices are kindness and unkindness. But it will take loads and loads  <br/>\nof treating his feelings with respect to rebuild trust in you that you  <br/>\ndo care about his feelings before he can give that back.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":351836297,"authorName":"Amanda Mayan","from":"&quot;Amanda Mayan&quot; &lt;amanda@...&gt;","profile":"amandabpearl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Was I wrong?

For my husband, respect is a big trigger; if I<br/>\ncontradict him in front of the kids. He sees it as a respect issue..me for<br/>\nhis parenting, them for him maybe. Sometimes I will let stuff he says or<br/>\ndoes slide.and if it really bugged me, bring it up when we are alone..2<br/>\nhours or even 2 days later.and then I bring it up super constructively <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I know you want the best possible relationship with your daughter, and when<br/>\nyou do x I think it undermines the relationship in y way..maybe you could<br/>\ntry accomplishing that same goal through..&quot;  Is the basic dialogue. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, I will also chime in right after he says something with a gentle<br/>\nand subtle modification..or I will distract my daughter in another room.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not really about who&#39;s &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; more about how to make a<br/>\nlifestyle that you (hopefully) both desire work for your family unit. We&#39;ve<br/>\nnever done and don&#39;t really believe in bedtimes.but when Maya was about 3<br/>\nand Noah just born, my daughter and husband went on a camping trip with a<br/>\nlocal homeschool group.he came back saying that she needed some limits<br/>\n(there are some unschoolers in the group confusing  RU for having no<br/>\npersonal limits and boundaries if it contradicts what the kids want) ..he<br/>\nwanted her to have a bedtime so we could have &quot;adult&quot; time.I resisted for a<br/>\nwhile, because I knew that if I laid down with her I was asleep for the<br/>\nnight too, and because I didn&#39;t like the idea of a bedtime.however, it was<br/>\nREALLY important to him, so I said yes, as long as bedtime was his. Long<br/>\n(slightly off topic) story short.he got the &quot;yes&quot; and felt like he was being<br/>\nheard and that his input mattered.around the same time I realized that<br/>\n&quot;adult time&quot; was not time with me, but his  way of saying he wanted to watch<br/>\nTV undisturbed and we got a second TV, lastly, since he is the one that<br/>\nneeds to help with bedtime (since we have a baby too and I cannot manage<br/>\nboth to bed at the same time) he rarely initiates it..when he does, it&#39;s<br/>\njust reading and cuddling till Maya falls asleep..but he still feels like<br/>\nshe has a &quot;bedtime&quot; (however fluid) and that he has say as a parent.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne other note, since you mentioned you&#39;re having a hard time figuring out<br/>\nhow/ when to correct.I think a lot of parents (at least many of the ones<br/>\nI&#39;ve had a chance to observe) confuse the intent of RU with having the child<br/>\nbe &quot;the center of the universe&quot;..in our family we are all equals.thus, if<br/>\nMaya is doing something annoying to me I tell her.for information.I assume<br/>\nthat&#39;s not her intent, but sometimes tap shoes on all tile floors are just<br/>\ntoo grating to me, so I&#39;ll give her the suggestion of playing with them<br/>\nlater, going outside to play with them , or having me go to another room if<br/>\nI can so that she can continue in the room she is..usually she&#39;d prefer to<br/>\nhang with me than her tap shoes, so she&#39;ll do something else with me, but I<br/>\nwould never let her just continue doing something that grated my nerves just<br/>\nto avoid giving a limit.(though I look for an option that does work for<br/>\neveryone).but I think it is important to model (and truly have) respect for<br/>\nyour personal boundaries and needs..that is just setting a good example for<br/>\nyour kids<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":431370813,"authorName":"atvannoy","from":"&quot;atvannoy&quot; &lt;atvannoy@...&gt;","profile":"atvannoy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Was I wrong?

I think it is perfectly acceptable for somebody to tell another person that something they are doing is bothering them. My husband is a big kid and will joke around at the table and ask the kids if they want to see seafood and then he will open his mouth. I will ask him to knock it off because it is making me lose my appetite. I don&#39;t like looking at chewed food while I am trying to eat. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think in situations like that, it is best to try to help find a middle ground.
