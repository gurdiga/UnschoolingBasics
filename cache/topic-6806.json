I am concerned about my husband & son&#39;s <br/>\nfuture. My son&#39;s &quot;behind&quot; according to &quot;School Standards&quot; and I&#39;m just <br/>\nworried about what&#39;s going to happen if I&#39;m no longer here to unschool <br/>\nhim. My son will have to go to some type of school, most likely, <br/>\nbecause my husband is unable to take him to work daily.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave any of you thought of this or gone through this?<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nFirst, I&#39;m so sorry that you have to go through the process of even thinking about it.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut as some have already said, have a positive attitude: it may actually be nothing.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhere do you live, Holly? I&#39;m sure we can hook you up---or help start a network, at least---of unschoolers in your area that can give you advice and help your husband make things work.<br/>\n <br/>\nOn a sad, but hopeful, note---and this is for ALL parents because we never know what will happen from day-to-day: I&#39;d like to suggest that you---and that we ALL---take a day to sit down with a video recorder and speak to our children. Tell them about us, about how it felt to hold them for the first time. Our hopes and dreams for them, the reasons we chose to unschool, etc. <br/>\n <br/>\n*Any*thing could happen to any of us any time. Having such a video could be such a comfort to a young child---hell, to ANY child! <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen it&#39;s too late, it&#39;s too late. Do it now. Do it soon. And add to it as they grow.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf something *were* to happen to you, Holly, or to any of us---young memories come hard sometimes---how we look, how we sound, what we want, how much we love them...these things can become fuzzy. A little piece of us on tape could be a very special gift.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI hope your doctor&#39;s wrong. I hope you have a long, long life and can hold that boy forever. But if not, this could be something he can have of you and cherish forever.<br/>\n <br/>\nI wish you the very best!<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\nOctober 6-9, 2005<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175529137,"authorName":"Donald and Sandra Winn","from":"Donald and Sandra Winn &lt;aplan4life@...&gt;","profile":"aplan4life","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Worst Case Scenario","postDate":"1127781197","msgId":6826,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwOTI3MDAzMzE4LjQ5NjUzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzMDA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":6824,"nextInTopic":6830,"prevInTime":6825,"nextInTime":6827,"topicId":6806,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Holly, I must echo the others here on getting a second opinion and not giving up.

Don&#39;t necessarily look only to homeschooling families. If <br/>\nyou&#39;ve got a couple of close friends who would simply be willing to <br/>\nprovide &#39;child care&#39; a few days per week, that&#39;s all you&#39;d need.

Stuff that DH might not be able to do simply because they <br/>\noccur during the day time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the worst case side, if you&#39;ve ever worked, your spouse, as <br/>\nguardian, would get some small amount of money in &#39;survivor&#39;s <br/>\nbenefit&#39; from what you&#39;ve paid in to Social Security. Perhaps that <br/>\nwould help pay for either child care or a relaxed private school or <br/>\nmaybe even, depending on your state laws, someone to act as a <br/>\nprivate tutor at your home. For that matter, maybe some sort of room <br/>\nand board in exchange for child care deal (sort of au pair style) <br/>\nmight be doable at that point (especially if you are near a <br/>\nuniversity - college kids can be a good resource).<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":229025198,"authorName":"Holly","from":"&quot;Holly&quot; &lt;hbinkley3@...&gt;","profile":"hbinkster3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Worst Case Scenario","postDate":"1127759024","msgId":6811,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRoOWViZytjNmptQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRoOWQ3ZSt2MWt1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":6808,"nextInTopic":6812,"prevInTime":6810,"nextInTime":6812,"topicId":6806,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank-you Deb, for your Hugs and your quick response.
