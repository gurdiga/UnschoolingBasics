I&#39;m very glad to have found this site.  Wherever we <br/>\ndiscover we belong on the ladder, I&#39;ve always found it best to expose <br/>\nmyself to new perspectives.  I&#39;ve already read some things I find <br/>\nrather surprising, but then after I let them settle with me, maybe <br/>\nless so surprising. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, yes - one reason we pulled Markus out is because he comes up with <br/>\nall these fascinating ideas and interests (less so the longer he was <br/>\nin school!), but then doesn&#39;t seem to care to take them anywhere.  He <br/>\nwas SO stressed with all the petty demands the school put on him, I <br/>\nbelieve he&#39;ll be more inclined to explore those interests once he&#39;s <br/>\nhad the chance to take a breath.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nRobin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":165509949,"authorName":"Andrea","from":"&quot;Andrea&quot; &lt;andrealynn@...&gt;","profile":"tobinsmommy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: new member introduction","postDate":"1140364108","msgId":10046,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGMwMWM2MzU2YiRmMGVkYjFjMCQwMjAwYThjMEBXdW5qbz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDExNDAzNTMzOTQuMzI1LjExOTI0Lm0yMEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10062,"prevInTime":10045,"nextInTime":10047,"topicId":10046,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Welcome to the list Robin, I think you will find a lot of good reading here!

When I do, I just plug into this group and I always feel very<br/>\nsupported in my decision to get the &quot;school&quot; out of learning!<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin wrote:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I do have a question.  Currently, Markus is reading Thomas<br/>\nMore&#39;s <br/>\nUtopia. (His pick.) I started talking to him about literary <br/>\ntechniques More used - he wasn&#39;t uninterested, but not really <br/>\nenthralled.  We&#39;ve talked a lot about Thomas More&#39;s life and he watch <br/>\nA Man for All Seasons today, which he found very interesting with <br/>\nregards to history and social stds.  My 1st inclination is to give <br/>\nhim some ideas to write about himself (he likes to write short <br/>\nstories) - i.e. what would his own Utopia look like or how does <br/>\nMore&#39;s Utopia/England compare to modern America, etc.  As an <br/>\nUNSCHOOLER, do you let them think of these things themselves or do <br/>\nyou offer the list and then let it be?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is nice to be offered information.  If the goal is to lay off the demands<br/>\nand free up his life so that he can see for himself what he is interested<br/>\nin, then making a suggestion is fine as long as you don&#39;t expect anything.<br/>\nIf you can&#39;t get to what you&#39;re interested in until all the demands are met,<br/>\nthere may be no joy or energy left...which is why (I think) you probably<br/>\ntook him out of school.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean he only finds things on<br/>\nhis own, you can inspire, and plant seeds by leaving things strewn about,<br/>\ngoing to interesting places, and having experiences but then if he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nseem interested, don&#39;t worry, and don&#39;t demand him to do anything with<br/>\nit...I always ask myself when I&#39;m eager to chime in...am I thinking of<br/>\npushing my own agenda, or supporting his?<br/>\n <br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nAndrea Bond, mom to Tobin (5 1/2)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10055,"nextTopicId":10060}}
