Seems simple but it is exciting to see him learning how to <br/>\nread so naturally.  He has had some frustration because his desire to <br/>\nread came long before his readiness but it is just really neat to see <br/>\nwhere he is at now with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12682,"nextTopicId":12709}}
