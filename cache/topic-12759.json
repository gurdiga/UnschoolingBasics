EVERY single person we&#39;re<br/>\ngoing to encounter in the next month loves their grandchildren and<br/>\nwill not harp on school BUT I know they&#39;ll raise issues.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not want schooling at all in our lives.  After reading books from<br/>\nJohn Holt, Grace Llwelyn and one other man, plus websites and blogs<br/>\nand everything else regarding schooling, I have nothing but loathing<br/>\nfor the whole educational system and agree with EVERYTHING you all<br/>\nhere and they have to say regarding unschooling.  There is no way on<br/>\nearth that I could ever go back to the way things were and feel good<br/>\nabout it, I feel as though I&#39;ve discovered the truth and can&#39;t go back<br/>\nto the lie.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care if my kids go to college or not but I want to be able to<br/>\ntell ds (who is dreaming of playing college football) with confidence<br/>\nthat if wants to go, he can but he doesn&#39;t need to concern himself<br/>\nwith it now. Who knows, he may find out that he does not like<br/>\nfootball.  Afterall, playing on a team here in our area and our area<br/>\nis known for not only jerkoff coaches but parents may have him<br/>\nreconsidering.  I want him to enjoy football but he may not like the<br/>\nrequirements and put-downs people give nowadays...personally, I prefer<br/>\nsports done as leisure and not competitively as I think they strip the<br/>\nenjoyment out of them.  Maybe Zak will feel the same.
