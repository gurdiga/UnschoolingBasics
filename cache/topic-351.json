DIFFERENT CHILD!  It was a male/female issue - I talked to<br/>\nhim and he helped us switch to a female doctor at the same office and her<br/>\nvisits have been fearless ever since.  With the dentist, I waited past when<br/>\neveryone said I should, till my daughter showed signs of readiness (she was<br/>\nalmost 4), and what got her interested was watching Caillou and Barney<br/>\nDentist episodes, reading a Barney story about a little girl going to the<br/>\ndentist, and another key was finding a very child-friendly dentist where<br/>\nthey are fabulous with kids and she gets to &quot;hold Mr. Thirsty&quot; during the<br/>\ncleanings and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have also read Pooh books about going to the Dr. and so forth and those<br/>\nseem to help.
