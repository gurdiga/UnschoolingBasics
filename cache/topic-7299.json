For example, peanut m&ms rather than plain m&ms, <br/>\nor butter pecan ice cream rather than cookie dough.

I<br/>\nnursed them through their tummy aches and never said &quot;I told you so.&quot; This<br/>\nmorning they both told me that they never wanted candy again. Of course they<br/>\nwill, but I think the EXPERIENCE has taught them something about moderation.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nOK. I think the big difference here is that I would have set out a platter of carrots and dip, sliced apples and caramel sauce, steamed edamame, some nuts, and some sliced meats and cheeses *along* with that big bowl of candy. My children would have eaten a bit of everything (and ALL the edamame would be gone!) and wouldn&#39;t have gotten tummyaches because they would have had choices *other* than just Milky Ways or Milk Duds.<br/>\n <br/>\nThey *get* to make wise choices and aren&#39;t forced to eat as much candy as they can to be filled up. They have *something* to moderate.<br/>\n <br/>\nAt our Halloween party last Sunday, there was enough candy to choke a horse, but I also offered teriyaki bat wings, deviled ham tombstone sandwiches, carrots and dill dip, celery and bleu cheese dip, Devil&#39;s food cupcakes, and popcorn---with spider cider.

Last night my kids wanted to eat some of their Halloween candy. Well,<br/>\nsome turned into quite a bit. I said, &quot;Careful with that stuff guys. You<br/>\nmight get a tummy ache.&quot; I did not say &quot;Ok guys, that&#39;s enough. Put the<br/>\ncandy away&quot; like I would have a few months ago. They continued to eat and<br/>\neat. (We do have candy in our house and they are free to have it whenever<br/>\nthey want but they don&#39;t eat much by choice)Anyway, they both ended up with<br/>\ntummy aches and my son had diarrhea as well as not being able to sleep. I<br/>\nnursed them through their tummy aches and never said &quot;I told you so.&quot; This<br/>\nmorning they both told me that they never wanted candy again. Of course they<br/>\nwill, but I think the EXPERIENCE has taught them something about moderation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been a real tough one for me. As a mom I want to protect them but I<br/>\nhave realized that this is not always what&#39;s best for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAubrey<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of averyschmidt<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 01, 2005 7:12 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Unschooling??Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Even as adults we have to do things we don&#39;t always feel like<br/>\n&gt; doing at the time (laundry, making dinner, going to work, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As adults we don&#39;t really &quot;have&quot; to do anything though.

We live in families and<br/>\nsometimes we have to make decisions as parents. You can&#39;t please everyone<br/>\nall the time. Even as adults we have to do things we don&#39;t always feel like<br/>\ndoing at the time (laundry, making dinner, going to work, etc). I think it&#39;s<br/>\nalways important to consider everyone&#39;s feelings and needs and to talk with<br/>\nour children about everything, but someone needs to lead. An example: I am<br/>\nowner of a homeschool group with a co-op. Not everyone always loves the<br/>\ndecisions I have to make and I wish I could accommodate everyone all the<br/>\ntime but I can&#39;t. Someone has to make a decision. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you are talking about arbitrary rules at all. We don&#39;t make<br/>\narbitrary rules in our house either. We have carefully thought out<br/>\nguidelines for the good of the family. The children have participated in<br/>\ndeciding a lot of these things so it&#39;s usually not an issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nI may be wrong, but I get the feeling that people are assuming that just<br/>\nbecause parents might have guidelines or are willing to make decisions that<br/>\nour children do not like that we don&#39;t have a loving, caring, respectful,<br/>\nbeautiful relationship with our children. That our home is somewhat of a war<br/>\nzone of sorts. This just isn&#39;t true.  Granted it&#39;s rare, but sometimes I do<br/>\nsay, &quot;I&#39;m sorry that you don&#39;t agree but I feel ....&quot;  I do talk to my<br/>\nchildren, as I&#39;m sure you do, and I will look for a way to accommodate their<br/>\nwants but sometimes we all have to do things we don&#39;t want to do. Example: a<br/>\ncouple of weeks ago my daughter was sick and I needed to go to the store to<br/>\nget her some cough medicine. My husband works nights so I can&#39;t wait until<br/>\nhe comes home. My son didn&#39;t want to come with me. He wanted to continue to<br/>\nplay his video game. I told him I would wait 15 minutes so he could finish.<br/>\nHalf an hour later he was arguing with me about going to the store. I talked<br/>\nto him about how awful his sister felt and how I thought that if he felt<br/>\nthis way he would surely want me to get him some medicine. He kept arguing,<br/>\nasking if it could wait till morning. I finally said, &quot;No, we have to go.<br/>\nPlease get in the car.&quot;   That&#39;s what I mean about making choices for the<br/>\nfamily. Sometimes it&#39;s just not possible to accommodate everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am finding that the more I talk to my children and ask how they feel or<br/>\nwhat they would like to do, instead of telling them, that I find them making<br/>\nbetter choices for themselves and the family in general. I am learning to<br/>\ngive them control over their lives and they are growing in so many ways.<br/>\nWhen they learn something for experience they remember it and the experience<br/>\nbecomes a part of them and helps them make future decisions, rather than if<br/>\nI had made the decision for them. Children learn from experience, just like<br/>\nadults do. I try not to protect them from every consequence that is not a<br/>\nlife and death situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nAubrey<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondary<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Secondary+school+education&w1=Secondary\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Secondary+school+education&w1=Secondary</a><br/>\n+school+education&w2=Home+school+education&w3=High+school+education&w4=Chica<br/>\ngo+school+education&w5=Middle+school+education&w6=New+york+school+education&<br/>\nc=6&s=176&.sig=Si1y5-GbIFxmtsZ06qFDhA&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nHome<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Secondary+scho\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Secondary+scho</a><br/>\nol+education&w2=Home+school+education&w3=High+school+education&w4=Chicago+sc<br/>\nhool+education&w5=Middle+school+education&w6=New+york+school+education&c=6&s<br/>\n=176&.sig=lQuwRSWZv2ns2lJpptv3Zg&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nHigh<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Secondary+scho\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Secondary+scho</a><br/>\nol+education&w2=Home+school+education&w3=High+school+education&w4=Chicago+sc<br/>\nhool+education&w5=Middle+school+education&w6=New+york+school+education&c=6&s<br/>\n=176&.sig=9oX42OVNGJI76xRkng0S1Q&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChicago<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Chicago+school+education&w1=Secondary+s\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Chicago+school+education&w1=Secondary+s</a><br/>\nchool+education&w2=Home+school+education&w3=High+school+education&w4=Chicago<br/>\n+school+education&w5=Middle+school+education&w6=New+york+school+education&c=<br/>\n6&s=176&.sig=_stqR9O2mwCTEFYQaVGiCg&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nMiddle<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Middle+school+education&w1=Secondary+sc\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Middle+school+education&w1=Secondary+sc</a><br/>\nhool+education&w2=Home+school+education&w3=High+school+education&w4=Chicago+<br/>\nschool+education&w5=Middle+school+education&w6=New+york+school+education&c=6<br/>\n&s=176&.sig=Y7kce6Gx2ZOIFBzIAv7ipQ&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nNew<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=New+york+school+education&w1=Secondary+\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=New+york+school+education&w1=Secondary+</a><br/>\nschool+education&w2=Home+school+education&w3=High+school+education&w4=Chicag<br/>\no+school+education&w5=Middle+school+education&w6=New+york+school+education&c<br/>\n=6&s=176&.sig=MaAGCNL4kr9M7OGCuZAW5g&gt;  york school education <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!

I would say yes.  I just don&#39;t agree that in <br/>\nevery little thing we have ask our children what they want to do, if <br/>\nthey&#39;re okay with us going or doing this or that.   They lead the way <br/>\nwith their learning but I truly feel that the rest is about a <br/>\ndifference in parenting styles.  I do agree with not making arbitrary <br/>\nrules and guidelines and considering your children&#39;s needs and <br/>\ndesires and not being controlling or &quot;having&quot; to do something just <br/>\nbecause, no matter what.  But there are times where things do have to <br/>\nbe done and that is what being in a family is all about...going <br/>\nplaces and working and doing things together as a family.  I guess I <br/>\nwould definitely not call ourselves as radical unschoolers but <br/>\nunschoolers we are.  You don&#39;t have to have young children setting <br/>\nbedtimes of midnight and beyond or change all plans because they&#39;re <br/>\nrefusing to go to the grocery store to be an unschooler. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I have misuderstood something somewhere and am incorrect I am <br/>\npretty sure someone will let me know (lol) but could we clarify where <br/>\nthings are a matter of unschooling or not unschooling and just the <br/>\nway families and children are different in what they do?!<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7683,"nextTopicId":7254}}
