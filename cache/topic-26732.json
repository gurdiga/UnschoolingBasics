You might consider<br/>\n&gt;adult-size punching bags for that sort of thing, if your furniture<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t take the beating. Also, inflatable furniture is great for<br/>\n&gt;really intense rough play - just don&#39;t expect it to last very long.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The good news is that while Ray&#39;s still pretty physical and<br/>\n&gt;energetic, he doesn&#39;t need nearly as much intense stimulation as he<br/>\n&gt;used to. So to some extent, it *is* a phase, in that as kids mature<br/>\n&gt;their needs will change, and that includes these kinds of physical<br/>\n&gt;needs.
