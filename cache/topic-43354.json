We face problems with the inlaws a lot. Just to add flavour to the mix my dh works for his parents, so our livlihood kind of depends on them. I don&#39;t have any answers but have enjoyed reading the answers given. It is very tough raising children differantly when the inlaws are very opinionated. I even went so far to try as to take MIL with us to an unschooling conference so she could see that they are functioning people. I don&#39;t think it went well in convincing her. We have put some in school, that didn&#39;t appease them, we have taken them home, it is so frusterating when no matter what you do they find fault with you and you are ruining your children. I don&#39;t get what is so wrong with me that I wouldn&#39;t want my children to &quot;turn out like me&quot;. I felt the most at peace in my family when we were just living life and learning along the way. <br/>\nThis week is March break here, so the ones who wanted to go to school still are home and some of them want to be pulled, the ones I pulled at Chirstmas, want to go back, I was angished over the decision to put them in and the pressure that was on me then and am anguishing again over what to do now. I just wanted you to know, I am in the same boat you are including the food fight issues with the inlaws, sometimes my only saving grace is repeating&quot; they won&#39;t live forever&quot;<br/>\nAs far as food issues go, I have had to stand up for my childrens right to eat what they want but also balance what MIL has as rules. I approached it from a wasteful persective for her. She midaswell make child friendly food that they enjoy, then fight to get them to eat roast, squash, turnip and otherthings that they just don&#39;t enjoy. It has seem to work better at family meals this way.

We divulge too<br/>\nmuch I think.  A simple exchange like:<br/>\n<br/>\nMIL : &quot;He is rude and fat.  You should have more control over him.&quot;<br/>\nYOU: &quot;Thank you for your advice, I know you want the best for him.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDONE.  What is she going to say after that?  You haven&#39;t given any ground<br/>\n(your situation sounds like resource fighting to me) and she feels heard.<br/>\nIf she presses you further you just say something like:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You know, I&#39;m going to have to cogitate on this a while, you&#39;ve given me a<br/>\nlot to think about.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, you haven&#39;t said she is right.  You aren&#39;t agreeing the kid needs<br/>\nsomething different than he&#39;s getting...you just are being polite to your<br/>\nMIL.  Who *probably* is in a panic over a rude, fat kid (or whatever she&#39;s<br/>\ncomplaining about) no doubt she&#39;s catastrophizing and sees him as a 30 yr<br/>\nold criminal.  Remember, this is new to her and not the way one &quot;ought&quot; to<br/>\nraise a child.  She&#39;s looking at your kid with the only tools she has in her<br/>\ntoolbox.  It&#39;s hard to give to MIL that she&#39;s likely doing the best she can<br/>\nwith what she has, but she probably is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what you mean by he&#39;s rude...but that one is the one that<br/>\nlikely sets her off.  You might work with him on not being so rude if it&#39;s<br/>\nreally awful stuff.  I don&#39;t know if you mean he interrupts when others are<br/>\ntalking (normal for a 4 yr old) or if he punches his grandmother when he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get his way (guaranteed to set MIL off....hell, it would set me off<br/>\nif a kid hit me because they didn&#39;t get the crusts cut off their toast.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to push and pull your boy into the mold your MIL has for him,<br/>\nbut he can be reminded that EVERYONE has the right to feel safe and happy.<br/>\nWe don&#39;t always get that but that ought to be the goal.  So if it&#39;s physical<br/>\n&quot;rudeness&quot; I&#39;d intervene....you know, I&#39;d intervene in all interactions so<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t have anything to complain about.  And if in the end she&#39;s still<br/>\ncomplaining, at least she feels heard and likely that will cut down on the<br/>\ncomplaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is my opinion based on dealing with my MIL who is a malignant<br/>\nnarcissist...the afore mentioned opinion should be recognized as MY opinion<br/>\nand your mileage may vary.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n&quot;Correlation does not imply causation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a<br/>\nnail.&quot; Abraham Maslow<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":351836297,"authorName":"Amanda Mayan","from":"&quot;Amanda Mayan&quot; &lt;amanda@...&gt;","profile":"amandabpearl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Nutrition, discipline and structure and the inlaws","postDate":"1268769539","msgId":43377,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzZmQwMWNhYzU0MyQxZjYzZGYwMCQ1ZTJiOWQwMCRAdXM+"},"prevInTopic":43371,"nextInTopic":43378,"prevInTime":43376,"nextInTime":43378,"topicId":43354,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... very sensitive to how differently we are parenting.

I confess that I am no longer as kind in these exchanges with my FIL because he has no respect for his son, for me or for my children.. he&#39;s made no effort to get to know them or us or to contribute in any meaningful way to their well being.  His goal is always control and browbeating to make sure that everyone is lower than he is.   I have given up and we basically have no relationship with him at this point.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents have asked questions and they have disagreed but always from the standpoint of &quot;explain to me what you are thinking so I can understand&quot;  rather than &quot;you are wrong I did it this way so it must be right&quot;    My mother asked me once if I felt untrusted as a child and I explained I never understood why there were rules about so many things and so many things that I had never considered even doing but there was a rule about it.   She feels like her generation parented in the way they did out of fear... there were so many different philosophies and each one seemed to contradict the one before it.  What people thought of you was so important and she feels like people got sucked into that worry.  I think on some level it&#39;s always that way it&#39;s just that we are a generation of caring much less about what other people think. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway kind and gentle explanation (not defense but just explaining your point of view)  I try to share articles and books and just funny experiences that others have shared.   My kids are older and my parents can see they have turned out &quot;ok&quot; so they aren&#39;t as nervous anymore but I tried really hard to understand that their concerns were out of their love for us and not a desire to control us.

I&#39;m still <br/>\nlearning to distance myself from this &#39;inner game&#39; of black mail. For <br/>\ninstance the &#39;bad childhood&#39;. I found that that was mainly my own <br/>\ninterpretation and that changed drastically after some tapping and is still <br/>\na work in progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nOftentimes interactions between adults and children trigger old wounds <br/>\nwithin me. And then, besides the urge to protect the child I try to work on <br/>\nthe wound within and when I get that right the interactions most often <br/>\nchange, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well.

I mention that she doesn&#39;t eat well when she&#39;s excited/stressed/busy so I&#39;m happy to see her eat anything at all while we&#39;re visiting. I also feed her before meals - and do it a little ostentatiously so that grandma/aunty can see that I&#39;m not neglecting the child *and* there&#39;s no reason to pull the &quot;if you want dessert...&quot; card. Its okay, she already ate. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; my son eats sweet foods almost exclusively.

At 4, sweets are going to give your guy the fast energy he needs to Be on the go all day. If you&#39;re concerned, making your own is a good way to calm some of your fears - you can load up cookies and cakes with nut meals for extra protein and experiment with different sweeteners if the impulse takes you. It also generally helps to offer more protein rich foods before he&#39;s saying he&#39;s hungry. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":153200361,"authorName":"Tracy Austin","from":"&quot;Tracy Austin&quot; &lt;webinfusion@...&gt;","profile":"tracyaustin30","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Nutrition, discipline and structure and the inlaws","postDate":"1268690794","msgId":43354,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEEzQzcyMTU4NENBNDQ4MjZCODRCNUYxNTMwQjlDRUU1QE93bmVyUEM+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43355,"prevInTime":43353,"nextInTime":43355,"topicId":43354,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So we went to the inlaws last weekend and had a huge blowup.
