My daughter picked hers out before I even<br/>\nknew what it was. It is a little monkey packpack that has a matching tether.<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t used it for anything more then a stuffed animal yet but then she<br/>\njust began really wanting to walk around outside instead of riding the<br/>\nstroller.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOur dd loved her leash as well.  She has always been into animals.  When she<br/>\nwas 2 she could make tons of animal sounds and did so frequently.  I would<br/>\nuse a leash if I had to go to the mall or somewhere the possibility of her<br/>\ngetting away from me could happen.  I lost her once in Dillards (a large<br/>\ndepartment store).  In a blink she darted off and decided to play hide &<br/>\nseek in the clothes rack.  Nearly gave me a heart attack.  I did not have<br/>\nthe choice of waiting until my DH got home to do my shopping nor did I have<br/>\nfamily near to help out.  My dh was in graduate school and working 2 jobs<br/>\nfor me to be able to stay home with our dd.  So I did what I had to do.<br/>\nHowever, all that to say...everytime I would put the leash on her (it was<br/>\nthe harness type) she would immediately start barking like a dog!  People<br/>\npassing by got a real kick out of it and some gave me the &quot;look&quot; as if I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t a very good mom.  We made it a game and had fun with it.  I guess it<br/>\nis all in how you treat it.  By the time our younger dd came along I had<br/>\nhelp and never had to use a leash with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Tracey in SC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10861,"nextTopicId":10950}}
