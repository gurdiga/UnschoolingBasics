My <br/>\nfather may be a little more skeptical (he&#39;s an engineer and very structured)  <br/>\nabout the unschooling, but not homeschooling. He and I had a few conversations  <br/>\nabout public schooling, and he agreed with most of my views. He&#39;s loves the <br/>\nkids  and just absorbs them and their curiosity about &quot;stuff&quot;. My brother, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t  think really cares much about whether they go to school or not. He&#39;s 6 <br/>\nyears  younger than me, in the military and living in KY with his girlfriend and <br/>\nher 11  year old son. He&#39;s stationed back in Iraq now, so my kids&#39; education I <br/>\nthink is  the least of his worries :o)<br/>\n <br/>\nBill&#39;s mom is the same way as my mom. Totally on-board the homeschooling  <br/>\nthing. She loves watching them live and learn and just interact with life. My  <br/>\nSIL and BIL are, I don&#39;t even know. They&#39;ve got enough stuff to worry about.  <br/>\nThey aren&#39;t bothered by us, and frankly, have no right to say anything. <br/>\n <br/>\nAs far as other extended family, everyone does the nod, &quot;that&#39;s cool&quot; and  <br/>\nmoves on.

I did what was recommended at unschooling.com: have summer vacation---don&#39;t make him do anything that even resembles school. Since it WAS summer vacation, that wasn&#39;t so hard. He & I went to Baltimore for a magic convention, then he flew to Australia for three weeks with People to People. The rest of the summer, he just hung out with friends while I read everything I could about unschooling. <br/>\n <br/>\nI *say* we took a sharp left turn from private school to unschooling-and it WAS pretty direct. I ordered a whole lot of curriculum catalogues, but never bought anything. Unschooling just made sooo much sense right away! <br/>\n <br/>\nPutting into practice, well...that&#39;s another thing! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nDid you have to work through fears<br/>\nof &quot;covering the basics&quot; or having him fall behind others in skills?<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nNot so much *fears*.  More like indoctrination. He told me he was *never* going to read again. Great! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI did stupid things like exclaim, &quot;That&#39;s geometry!&quot; when we packed the car for a trip to Savannah. And &quot;That&#39;s algebra!&quot; when he and a friend figured out a handicap while swimming. I read every day to him---mornings, usually, while he was still in bed. Short stories, mostly. Poems. I would ask him to create a piece of artwork that would relate the story or poem I&#39;d just read. (ugh!)<br/>\n <br/>\nI also found a few unschooly books: Skellig, Stargirl. We watched Ferris Beuller&#39;s Day Off---and I couldn&#39;t leave well-enough alone! &lt;BWG&gt; I *had* to mention how much they learned! &lt;G?<br/>\n <br/>\nI *knew* he was smart, so I never really worried about his falling behind or covering bases. ALSO---and I just now realized this, but he&#39;d been in private school. I knew he was already 2-3 grades ahead of the public schooled kids his age anyway---so I guess that, in a way, gave me some comfort. Never really thought of that before..<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nFrom an intellectual level, I understand and wholeheartedly agree with<br/>\nthe unschooling philosophy.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=--=<br/>\n <br/>\nYeah---that seems to be the easy part! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n I have the Unschooling Handbook and have<br/>\nread it through a few times over the years, as well as Gatto&#39;s<br/>\nUnderground History of American Education. Everything within me says a<br/>\nbig resounding YES to the idea of unschooling, but when it comes down<br/>\nto it I have to deal with the fears that have been engrained in me<br/>\nfrom all my years of schooling and then classroom teaching. <br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nWell, looking at what you&#39;ve learned without school can be *very* enlightening. My biggest year of learning (still) was my junior year in college when I went to Germany and Vienna. I didn&#39;t spend much time in actual classes---Europe was my *school*. So I really saw first-hand how much the classes actually meant and how much my &quot;free&quot; time in the caf√©&#39;s and at friends&#39; homes and in the Oper really meant  and that that was when the REAL learning happened. Really opened my eyes to schooling.  I hardly learned *anything* useful in the classes at the University of Vienna---the cool stuff happened AFTER classes!<br/>\n <br/>\nWe say that the rule of thumb regarding unschooling is one month for each year of schooling---that means YOU too! If you spent 12 years in school, four years in college, two years in grad school, three years teaching (for example)---that&#39;s a BUNCH of schooling to be getting rid of!!!  Your child will get it MONTHS before YOU do---IF you let him! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nEverything around us demands measureable results,<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-==-<br/>\n <br/>\nNoooo. Around schoolteachers, maybe. But not in *my* life! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nYou just have to let that old life go!<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-==-<br/>\n <br/>\n and going against the grain is hard,<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nBut that&#39;s true no matter *what* you do! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n especially as there is no unschooling group around here to provide support.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nWhere are you? You may be surprised!<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n So, hearing how others have taken the plunge<br/>\nand dealt with all those things would be reassuring.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s what&#39;s so wonderful about these lists and the conference. The lists can give you daily affirmation and support (even though we don&#39;t SAY we do, it happens all the same! &lt;G&gt;). The conference allows you to actually SEE others on the same path. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;re all out here, but we&#39;re busy doing our own thangs.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n Do you have support from your (extended) family? <br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nMy mother&#39;s a bit nuts, so I could explain and explain until I&#39;m dead , and she&#39;d ask, but how will he learn to read. I just don&#39;t bother there! &lt;G&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\nMy father is a psychiatrist. When we told him we were going to homeschool the boys, he said. &quot;All the homeschooling moms I&#39;ve known (many because of his business) have been some of the smartest women I&#39;ve met! You&#39;ll do just fine.&quot; He still doesn&#39;t get the UNschooling, but he sees how much the boys know and that they aren&#39;t floundering and stupid. that helps a lot. He took Cameron (17) to Scotland this August for 10 days. He was SOOOO impressed, I&#39;ll never hear another word against unschooling ever again, I bet! &lt;G&gt; Cameron really wowed him! <br/>\n <br/>\nMy brother isn&#39;t married, has no children, hated school, and is a captain of a yacht. He couldn&#39;t care less! <br/>\n <br/>\nBen&#39;s family is a whole &#39;nother story. I just don&#39;t do the Lovejoy Christmas party. I hand him the phone as soon as I know it&#39;s one of them. They&#39;re very controlling with their own kids, and have attacked us in the past---not mean---just &quot;questioning&quot;-you know. But ALL the nieces and nephews LOVE it here! &lt;G&gt; My children don&#39;t want to go to their houses, but all the other cousins want to be HERE! &lt;G&gt; We got one here for a week last year because he was suspended from school. His older brother ran away a couple of weeks ago because he didn&#39;t want to take the SAT and he knew his parents would be mad. The older sister was supposed to go to med school after graduating from college. Decided that 17 years of schooling was too much and didn&#39;t want any more! Is going to be a bum for a few years. Freaking the family out! &lt;G&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids are happy. It&#39;s soo obvious. I just smile and wave my hand dismissively and say, &quot;The proof is in the pudding, and I&#39;m a patient cook.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nHow old are your children?

Did you have to work through fears<br/>\nof &quot;covering the basics&quot; or having him fall behind others in skills?<br/>\nFrom an intellectual level, I understand and wholeheartedly agree with<br/>\nthe unschooling philosophy. I have the Unschooling Handbook and have<br/>\nread it through a few times over the years, as well as Gatto&#39;s<br/>\nUnderground History of American Education. Everything within me says a<br/>\nbig resounding YES to the idea of unschooling, but when it comes down<br/>\nto it I have to deal with the fears that have been engrained in me<br/>\nfrom all my years of schooling and then classroom teaching. <br/>\nEverything around us demands measureable results, and going against<br/>\nthe grain is hard, especially as there is no unschooling group around<br/>\nhere to provide support. So, hearing how others have taken the plunge<br/>\nand dealt with all those things would be reassuring.
