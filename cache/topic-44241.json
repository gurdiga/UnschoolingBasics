Don&#39;t express or otherwise reveal your concern to her.  Her self esteem will be better if you can show her your calm confidence that things will come out ok.  Help her understand it&#39;s more about brain readiness than desire to learn and lots of people read later.   Maybe stories of later readers would help her feel better.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***She has always enjoyed Girl Scouts but I can see her shying away from that now too.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know anything about girl scouts but maybe it would be possible to explain to her leader that she&#39;ll need support for reading stuff.    I know it&#39;s hard to see a child move away from something she&#39;s previously enjoyed but being uncomfortable about not being able to read isn&#39;t a less valid reason for leaving an activity than some other reason.   We look at it like it&#39;s wrong somehow but if she left soccer because she realized she just wasn&#39;t good at sports, it probably wouldn&#39;t feel the same to you because you understand not everyone is great at sports.   Not everyone is great at reading at the age of twelve.  <br/>\nMy husband can read but doesn&#39;t really enjoy reading and if he can get to something without reading about it, without reading directions or details, he much prefers that approach.   He&#39;s fifty.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I&#39;m wondering if I should seek help for her at this point. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my kid wasn&#39;t reading at twelve I would not have looked for help.   Help always focuses on how the child is not measuring up, not getting it, how she&#39;s wrong.    Read to her often if she likes that.  Don&#39;t coach her to sound out words if she&#39;s trying to read something just tell her what the word is.  Get a lot of audio books, old time radio programs if she&#39;d like that, poetry recordings.   Listen together.  Talk to her about books you&#39;re reading, read little snippets of something wonderful from a book you&#39;re enjoying or an article you liked.   Watch foreign language films with subtitles if she&#39;d like that.  Amelie was on the other night and it&#39;s so quirky and charming.  (some sexual content if she&#39;d be ok with that)   Read the subtitles to her.   We had so much fun with this when Dylan was little. (he liked Japanese monster movies)  Watch English language films with rich language.  Learn some great songs together and sing.   If she likes to sing, get a karaoke machine and some cd&#39;s.     Play Mad Libs.  You do the work, write the words for her,  and then read the crazy sentences to her.   We played a game like that when Dylan was younger.   We wrote words on little pieces of paper or whatever was handy and then we&#39;d draw the little papers at random to make funny sentences.   Magnetic poetry for your refrigerator might be fun.   A white board or chalk board where you can leave her a little message - &quot; I love you!&quot;  or   &quot;Cookies!&quot;    Have fun with words and language.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Another reading question","postDate":"1274453274","msgId":44264,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYwMjQ4MS45MTc1My5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGh0NGhpbStxNWMxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh0NGhpbStxNWMxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44262,"nextInTopic":44266,"prevInTime":44263,"nextInTime":44265,"topicId":44241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Did you just write that she read does books?

That&#39;s a possibility. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;She has a lot of trouble grasping abstract concepts. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All the more reason to avoid anything like phonics - its probably the most abstract route to reading, breaking ideas down into representations of sounds and then building those sounds back up into words. Stated that way, it sounds ridiculously complicated! Its a wonder Anyone learns that way ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she have trouble putting small ideas together into bigger ideas? Ray&#39;s like that, although he has no developmental delays. He&#39;s just not very logical - he can&#39;t build an idea out of smaller ideas, he needs to grasp the big idea *and* the smaller ideas in order to see how they fit together. That&#39;s sometimes baffling for me and George because we&#39;re very logical - we don&#39;t think the way he does. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Sometimes when she is trying to read something and asks for help I may sound it out for her or may just read it to her.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nI really really recommend *not* sounding things out. What kinds of things does she like you to read to her?. Do you run your finger under the words while you read? Some people find that helpful. Do you put subtitles or captions on the tv and games? That can be helpful, too. Keep lots of print in her world - reading, captions, games, its not all that hard ;) and give her lots of reassurance that she&#39;ll read when she&#39;s ready. People who read later almost seem to do it by magic, sometimes - she won&#39;t be aware of herself learning and you won&#39;t see anything until it suddenly clicks. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209361242,"authorName":"JJ","from":"&quot;JJ&quot; &lt;jrossedd@...&gt;","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Another reading question","postDate":"1274387859","msgId":44254,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh0NDZpaisxcHZrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGh0NDR0cCsybnQzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44253,"nextInTopic":44255,"prevInTime":44253,"nextInTime":44255,"topicId":44241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We lived through a similarly unusual processing problem that affected basic math, and also showed up in room disorganization, really great writing skills that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-931795848\">We lived through a similarly unusual processing problem that affected basic math, and also showed up in room disorganization, really great writing skills that masked it, etc.  We never had her checked out although I secretly worried about whether I should, until she was a couple of years into community college and it finally came to a head.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is something she wrote about it as it was happening:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://misedjj.wordpress.com/2008/03/27/well-that-explains-a-lot/\">http://misedjj.wordpress.com/2008/03/27/well-that-explains-a-lot/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI mention this to say that it turned out not just fine to wait, but better than fine. Had we pursued diagnosis and therapy when she was still school-aged, the clinical psychologist told us she would not have been accommodated but remediated, even though it isn&#39;t possible to change or improve her specific coding disorder. All it would have done is make her focus on a problem rather than on her many strengths (which are extraordinary!) Certainly the schools&#39; &quot;remediation&quot; protocol would have sapped her confidence in her general ability and intelligence.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, she was able to stop struggling and to substitute science and computer courses for the required college math; she is a straight-A senior at a major public university, with all sorts of honors and scholarships, now preparing for the GRE so she can begin graduate school in library science and museum curation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GRE is all math and verbal,btw, half and half. No accommodations allowed. She doesn&#39;t care. She is cheerfully planning to ace the verbal and do what she can around her disorder with the math sections. She is supremely confident it will be enough when they see her undergrad record along with her verbal performance.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer brain works exactly the same as it always has and always will. The difference between her success breezing along with it, and the tragic failure of most kids who have the same coding function, is mainly that she was radically unschooled and that has made all the difference. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;centurykissed&quot; &lt;southernbelle@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you to all who responded.<br/>\n&gt; She tends to get frustrated when she tries but can&#39;t seem to get it.
