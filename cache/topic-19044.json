Guess what?  They read just find now.  Some have loved reading<br/>\nand some read because they need to.  Guess what?  It is no different<br/>\nthan any other child who was forced to read at an early age.  I taught<br/>\nmyself to read when I was just 3 yo.  My mom read to me every night<br/>\nand I got tired of waiting until the next night to learn what happened<br/>\n(we were reading Black Beauty at the time).  So I taught myself.  I&#39;m<br/>\nan avid reader.  My brother was forced to learn to read in<br/>\nkindergarden and to this day only reads that which he needs to in<br/>\norder to get through life.  Some people will read because they love<br/>\nit, and other people will read because they need to.  Doesn&#39;t matter<br/>\nreally when they learn.  I have an uncle who didn&#39;t learn to read<br/>\nuntil he was in his late 20&#39;s.  He is dyslexic and words were just a<br/>\njumble to him and didn&#39;t make sense.  Then he learned some tricks to<br/>\nhelp him read and now he loves reading and while it takes him longer<br/>\nto read he loves it.  His sister was a &quot;smarty pants&quot; in school.<br/>\nAlways did well without trying and she could care less about reading<br/>\neven though she can do it well.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading isn&#39;t the end all be all of learning.  One can learn A LOT<br/>\nwithout ever picking up a book!  Live with your child, proceed with<br/>\neach day as it comes.  You&#39;ve got a great start in beginning when your<br/>\nchild is so young.  What a boon that many of us didn&#39;t have!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":267954153,"authorName":"Brian & Alexandra Polikowsky","from":"&quot;Brian & Alexandra Polikowsky&quot; &lt;polykow@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Hi, I&#39;m new, excited and nervous.","postDate":"1163905410","msgId":19045,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjkwMWM3MGI4NyQ0YWFhNjU0MCQ2NDU4YThjMEBPZmZpY2U+","referencesHeader":"PGVqb2Q1cCtoMmlvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19044,"nextInTopic":19046,"prevInTime":19044,"nextInTime":19046,"topicId":19044,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have read a book called Homeschooling for Excellence and this family has 4 boys ( 2 adopted) and they all went to Harvard.
