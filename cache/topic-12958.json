I&#39;d already been struggling with a strong &quot;urge&quot; to create some <br/>\npurpose in my life and open myself up to new possibilities.  I think <br/>\nthis &quot;feeling&quot; was magnified or enhanced by the removal of our last <br/>\none, the 14 year old, from public school.  My acessment is that I am <br/>\nfinally deschooling myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEven though I have been at home with the youngest for several years, <br/>\nour years unschooling are only a part of our homeschooling journey, <br/>\nI don&#39;t think I ever quite experienced the &quot;let down&quot; like this due <br/>\nto the fact that I was still bound by schooly schedules and related <br/>\ninfringements on my time and life.  Now, things are different.  <br/>\nThere are three kids at home, not just one, and I have more time to <br/>\nthink about what it is we should/could be doing with our <br/>\ntime...specifically myself, but also the kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSince the oldest came home in December I&#39;ve really just kind of <br/>\nbacked off and handed over the reigns to each individual.  BUT, this <br/>\npart is becoming a little confusing for me.  Time seems to slip away <br/>\nVERY quickly during the day.  I&#39;m unsure as to how to find MY <br/>\npassions, be a good example, engage my children and provide a fun <br/>\nand stimulating life experience for everyone...myself included.  How <br/>\ndo I create this &quot;ideal&quot; environment for them when I don&#39;t even know <br/>\nwhat it is?  How do I show them how to be an engaged person in life <br/>\nwhen I have not fully engaged myself?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I need to do these things quickly.  When I started this <br/>\njourney with the youngest one I figured we would kind of grow <br/>\ntogether.  Now that I have older ones at home it seems a bit more <br/>\nurgent.  We are in unfamiliar territory together.  Currently, I feel <br/>\nas though I&#39;m wandering maybe not to aimlessly, but a little more so <br/>\nthan I&#39;m comfortable with.  I feel myself on the cusp of a huge <br/>\ndiscovery, but I just don&#39;t know quite how to unravel the elements.  <br/>\nDoes this make sense to anyone?<br/>\n<br/>\nI just feel like I need to be doing something more, but I don&#39;t know <br/>\nwhat it is...<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13464,"nextTopicId":13883}}
