She wants to  start taking courses at the <br/>\nlocal community college, here in NC you can do that  starting at age 16.  There <br/>\nare some stipulations that I won&#39;t get into here  but she can&#39;t take the <br/>\nremedial math classes, she must pass the entrance  test to be able to take any <br/>\nclasses that require a math prerequisite.  Not  sure that makes any sense but <br/>\nanyway.  She wanted to be able to pass the  entrance test so she, with her mom&#39;s <br/>\nhelp, went to the local book store and  library just looking through the math <br/>\nbooks.  Looking for one that was  simple but not too repetitive etc.  Anyway <br/>\nshe found one that she liked and  has worked through it on her own.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat she found is that the book store and library had  a wider selection than <br/>\nthe local homeschool supply store.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHTH,<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16558,"nextTopicId":16597}}
