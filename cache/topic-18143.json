I think your right with just trying to avoid certain <br/>\nsituations.  He definately does great when we meet at a park or museum, ect... then when <br/>\nit&#39;s at someones house and there&#39;s toys and other things that seem to cause conflict.  One <br/>\nof my friends that we get together with has an almost 3 year old and for the most part <br/>\nthey get along, but both of them can be very intense at times and it takes my friend & I to <br/>\nhelp diffuse the situation which can sometimes take 10 minutes!  I really trust this friend <br/>\nand she totally understands my son&#39;s needs/wants as well as her own child&#39;s.  She&#39;s also a <br/>\nfellow unschooler so we&#39;re on the same page.  That being said I still get stressed out when <br/>\nwe make plans to get together at either of our houses because there also eventually is <br/>\nconflict and it&#39;s hard for me to help my son socialize when I have a 12 month old that is <br/>\nnursing or wanting to be held, ect...<br/>\n<br/>\nToday in the car I was actually talking with the aforementioned friend about a mom&#39;s get <br/>\ntogether tonight and when I hung up my son said &quot;what were you talking about&quot; and I said <br/>\n&quot;about us getting together tonight&quot; (he thought I meant all of us), and he said (for the first <br/>\ntime ever) &quot;I really hate getting together&quot;, and I said &quot;you hate getting together?&quot; and he <br/>\nsaid &quot;ya, because everyone likes to make their own choices and when we get together <br/>\npeople try and make my choices&quot;.

I don&#39;t think he would be <br/>\nclassified as &quot;spirited&quot; or &quot;explosive&quot;, because most of the time we go along without <br/>\nconflict, but I&#39;ve definately gained some insight by reading &quot;Raising Your Spirited Child&quot; for <br/>\nthe times that he is overwhelmed with emotions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like your suggestions of just mirroring what he is saying, I&#39;ve tried that before in <br/>\ndifferent situations and it does seem to work.  For example if there is a show he wants to <br/>\nwatch that isn&#39;t on, instead of saying &quot;you can&#39;t watch it because it&#39;s not on, I know you <br/>\nwant to, but it&#39;s not on&quot;, I will just say &quot;that show isn&#39;t on right now&quot; and then just keep <br/>\nrepeating &quot;you really want to watch that show now!&quot; and then he knows that I am hearing <br/>\nhim instead of trying to shut him up or just trying to make him feel better about it, which <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to help, it&#39;s almost antagonizing in a way to hear &quot;I know you want to, but <br/>\nyou can&#39;t&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your insight,<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi Julie.

First, is it possible to avoid these  <br/>\n&gt; problematic situations for awhile?  At that age, there were only a very few  people we <br/>\n&gt; could hang around and those moms were sympathetic to the issue.

So when he says <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I can do what I want!&quot; say &quot;wow! you can do what you want?  cool!&quot; and see <br/>\n&gt; where it leads.

My dh & I have a 4.5 year old and a 12 month old.  We <br/>\nhave totally embraced the &quot;discipline&quot; philosphy of unschooling, mostly modeling how we <br/>\nwant our sons to act.  For the most part we don&#39;t have conflicts in the house (occasionally <br/>\nbetween the two, which just seems age appropriate at this time).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway my question has to do with the non negotiables concerning our 4.5 year olds <br/>\nbehavior when it is affecting another child&#39;s.  We aren&#39;t around other kids a whole lot, and <br/>\nwhen we are he tends to get agressive at times.  What I&#39;ve noticed is that he does very well <br/>\nwith older kids that he associates with, but it is the younger kids that he seems to <br/>\noverpower or get frustrated with.  How do you deal with agressive behavior?  Our son is <br/>\nable to pretty much do what he wants when he wants when it doesn&#39;t concern hurting <br/>\nanother person, but when I step in under the latter situation he gets very defensive saying <br/>\n&quot;I can do whatever I want to do&quot;, and I try telling him &quot;not when it concerns another <br/>\nperson&quot;.  I try to be positive and give him alternatives of what he can do, but sometimes <br/>\nhe literally seems out of control and can&#39;t redirect himself.  I know that sometimes he just <br/>\ngets overwhelmed with other kids in general and if we are at home he will hop on the <br/>\ncomputer or ask to watch a video to kind of take a break from the other children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday a friend of mine came over with her two kids (3 and 10 months), and he was <br/>\ngetting agressive with both kids, which is unusual because he is usually very good with <br/>\nbabies, but he pulled on the baby&#39;s shirt at one point and even pushed her over once.  <br/>\nAlso at one point he was &quot;riding&quot; this plastic snail we have in the backyard very close to <br/>\nthe baby and I tried to move him away saying &quot;let&#39;s ride the snail over here so we don&#39;t <br/>\naccidentally hit the baby&quot; and it turned into a power struggle of him moving it back to be <br/>\nnear the baby. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you react in these types of situations?  What are some good ways to dialogue with <br/>\nthe child during an intense conflict?  Sometimes I&#39;m just at a loss and then feel like he is <br/>\ngetting away with inappropriate behaviors (I know not a good way to look at the situation).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions would be appreciated,<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18203,"nextTopicId":18240}}
