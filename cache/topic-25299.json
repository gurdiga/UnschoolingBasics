I remember having to leave the park to get home in time for<br/>\nX to begin, or the kids asking to be awakened for X and if they overslept,<br/>\nthey were inconsolable after missing their planned show. The VCR helped fill<br/>\nthe gap at that time.<br/>\nMy perspective had to change, too, though. When I began seeing their shows<br/>\nas important as a playdate, for example, it increased my acceptance. Monday<br/>\nnights (8-9pm, january thru may) were once known as &quot;Mommy&#39;s date with<br/>\nKiefer&quot; (actually, we still use that to describe 24!) which was held as a<br/>\nsacred time for me to hang out with my favorite TV characters; I&#39;d mommy<br/>\nduring commercials. Seeing SpongeBob/Simpsons/Family Guy through the same<br/>\nlens made it so much easier for me to see their joy and participate in it.<br/>\nI&#39;d only talk to them during commercials, too, giving the same respect they<br/>\nso happily gave to me.<br/>\nNowadays, however, with the DVR-type technology, cable channels on-demand,<br/>\nand full episodes available on the internet -- it&#39;s a moot point. We&#39;re no<br/>\nlonger a &quot;slave&quot; to the television schedule as it happens. I can pause and<br/>\nparent and come right back to my date :D We&#39;ve got a multitude of shows<br/>\nawaiting to be seen at the exact moment we&#39;re in the mood. The fast<br/>\nforwarding of commercials (or the absence of them, as on the internet) has<br/>\nalso eliminated the complaints against advert manipulation.<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\nhannahbearski.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":285320662,"authorName":"Johanna","from":"Johanna &lt;dialog@...&gt;","profile":"solelokua","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Independet from TV-programme","postDate":"1185817479","msgId":25299,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhERjc0Q0NBLTdDQ0EtNEJGMS1CMEYxLTg5RDRGRkY0QzY5Q0B1bmVyem9nZW4uZGU+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25302,"prevInTime":25298,"nextInTime":25300,"topicId":25299,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey, I didn t have the time to read all of your posts about Why it is positive (or not) not to have a TV (and I m ashamed to say that I only read the first","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-701045571\">Hey,<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t have the time to read all of your posts about &quot;Why it is  <br/>\npositive (or not) not to have a TV&quot; (and I&#39;m ashamed to say that I  <br/>\nonly read the first of them). I just want to tell you our latest  <br/>\nexperiences with non-restriction on TV: Our daughter (8) is not  <br/>\nwatching any TV at all! Only videos she chooses, which we have on DVD  <br/>\nor which we rent from the video store. It took 11 months of patience,  <br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all started almost a year ago, august 2007, when we let go of all  <br/>\nrestrictions regarding TV (and just about everything). The first  <br/>\nmonths she (7 at the time) would watch TV practically all day (except  <br/>\nin the mornings, because of school – some of you know, I&#39;m from  <br/>\nGermany and it&#39;s illegal to fully unschool, so she&#39;s there in the  <br/>\nmornings, though now in a &quot;free&quot; school with an unschooling  <br/>\napproach). She didn&#39;t want to do anything with us of the things we  <br/>\noffered, she always chose TV. She sent her friends away who wanted to  <br/>\nplay with her, because she wanted to watch TV and not miss anything.  <br/>\nIt was very hard to watch but also showed me, how big the damage  <br/>\nalready was that I had done! This &quot;addiction&quot; was something *I* had  <br/>\ncreated!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we went over a period where she started watching less, but still  <br/>\n3-4 hours a day. But she didn&#39;t send her friends away anymore, and  <br/>\neverything else but TV was welcome. TV was only to pass the time in  <br/>\nbetween things or when she was bored. But she started to make her own  <br/>\nsteps towards other activites she could pursue. Also, activities that  <br/>\nwe offered were welcome again. We experience(d) complaints about her  <br/>\nfriends coming over and only wanting to watch TV instead of playing  <br/>\nwith her, because at home they aren&#39;t allowed to watch TV (same with  <br/>\nsweets ;-)).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut still, she was &quot;restricted&quot; to the times of the programme. She  <br/>\nfelt attached to the times her series were shown and couldn&#39;t let it go.<br/>\n<br/>\nFull freedom came only when we finally followed the advice of so many  <br/>\nunschoolers here. We don&#39;t have such a service as TiVo, but we found  <br/>\na TV-&quot;Stick&quot; for the Computer (for Apple computers, called &quot;The  <br/>\nTube&quot;).
