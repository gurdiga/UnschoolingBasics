I was listening to one of my favorite albums (Amplified Heart by Everything But The Girl) two little ones were napping, my dd 9 was drawing and ds 7 was keeping me company during my 20 minute cleanup before heading off to a july 4 barbecue at the neighbor&#39;s house.  The lyrics resonated with me, as I and my husband grow closer to unschooling in all aspects of our lives.  <br/>\n  &quot;If you lose your faith,babe, you can have mine, and if you&#39;re lost, I&#39;m right behind, cause we walk the same line.&quot;  <br/>\n  I have grown so much in the last year in really believing that we are our kids&#39; partners and that we are here to help them when they fall.  We are all on the same journey together. There is so much less pressure when I am not the one in control, but feel like we are working together, lending out faith to one another when it&#39;s needed.<br/>\n  Thanks to everyone on this list for helping me to listen and see in a different way.

I would start thinking of her as just the right size <br/>\nrather than tiny.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOur 6 year old (Sam) is a sugar addict.  We have always had candy and junk <br/>\nbut I rationed it until a few months ago when I stopped telling my children what <br/>\nto eat.  He has a history of anemia and low energy and we have carried him a <br/>\nlot due to his fatigue, since he was born.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Monday we visited a 100 acre park and he ran and climbed and lead the rest <br/>\nof us through the museums and gardens.  My husband pointed out how much <br/>\nenergy he&#39;s had lately and how we haven&#39;t had to carry him in a few months.  I <br/>\nlater mentioned it to Sam and said that he seemed to have a lot more energy since <br/>\nhe&#39;s been eating healthier.  His response was &quot;No, Mom, I have more energy <br/>\nsince I&#39;ve been eating what I want.&quot;  The latter is true.  He has been having ice <br/>\ncream for breakfast sometimes, a lot of soda because of the cookout season, <br/>\ncandy, etc., without limits.  He also eats a variety of other foods along with <br/>\nall the junk.  Basically, since I stopped worrying about what the kids eat, <br/>\nthere has become nothing to worry about.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to let go. Many pediatricians will tell you that kids don&#39;t generally eat <br/>\na balanced diet each day but take in a balanced diet each month.  That is <br/>\ntrue for my children as they sometimes eat a whole bag of carrots and then don&#39;t <br/>\neat another carrot for a week or they eat a pound of steak and have no meat <br/>\nfor a while.  It does work out. Since you&#39;re kids are so young, you still have a <br/>\nlot of control about what foods you provide and bring into the home.  Find <br/>\nstuff they love that is healthy and keep it available.  My kids have been eating <br/>\nwatermelon and plums for weeks and can&#39;t get enough of them.  We buy mostly <br/>\norganic, whole foods but there are M &M&#39;s and Pringles in our cupboards as <br/>\nwell.  Let your kids add some items to your grocery list and see how their <br/>\nrequests change over time as you surrender control.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, grazing is a much healthier way to eat than cleaning your plate at each <br/>\nsitting.  Take it from my strong, lean children who consume food all day and <br/>\ntheir chunky parents who eat three square meals.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe adults have a lot to learn and we have been learning a lot by listening to <br/>\nour kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nRobin in MA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15338,"nextTopicId":15347}}
