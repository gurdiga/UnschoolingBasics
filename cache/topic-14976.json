He slowly gets better and better at<br/>\npicking up new tools.:)  He still has minor melt-downs. Minor to me,<br/>\nbecause in the past it would take 1/2 hour or more to help him<br/>\ncalm....now it&#39;s usually short-lived. The best part about remaining<br/>\ngentle and sweet even when they&#39;re unpleasant? They trust you, they<br/>\nhug you, they are SO totally loving in between any unpleasantness!:)<br/>\nIt builds great relationships and that is the world to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Rudeness","postDate":"1151414562","msgId":14976,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU3cmJmMis2cjBkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14978,"prevInTime":14975,"nextInTime":14977,"topicId":14976,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"B) Hand it to him but tell him my honest feelings about being spoken to like that.
