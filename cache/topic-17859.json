I think so.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I personally do is limit what I share with others.  I guess I <br/>\npick and choose what I say, and to whom I say it, very carefully.  I <br/>\nthink we get excited and want to share it (unschooling and the <br/>\nfreedom found there) with everyone, because how could they not want <br/>\nto be free?  In our enthusiasm and zest for a peaceful life we tend <br/>\nto forget that most of the people in our everyday lives don&#39;t think <br/>\noutside the box.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to keep focused and centered I keep my ideas to myself and <br/>\nshare little bits here and there.  It seems to be more effective <br/>\nthat way anyhow.  Most people don&#39;t seem to be too open to <br/>\nalternative ways of thinking especially when it comes to education.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong.  I do have discussions here and there about <br/>\nsimple living, mindful parenting and unschooling.  I just watch my <br/>\nwords very carefully and make sure I am up to the challenge before I <br/>\nsay &quot;too much&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I find myself getting frustrated or discouraged or I am <br/>\nquestioning myself in any way related to unschooling and the <br/>\ndecisions I have made for myself and my family I come here.  I read <br/>\nthe blogs of like minded people.  I signed up for Scott Noelle&#39;s <br/>\nDaily Groove email list.  I read it daily.  I submerge myself in <br/>\nreassuring information.  I stay centered.  I look at my children and <br/>\nsee the self-confident, independent, beautifully free young people <br/>\nthat they are.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLook, listen, observe, interact, live, know, be...  <br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205212236,"authorName":"Cara","from":"&quot;Cara&quot; &lt;casonnier@...&gt;","profile":"casonnier","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Help with doubt and &#39;idealism&#39;","postDate":"1160002971","msgId":17859,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVnMWVpciszc2ZiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":17864,"prevInTime":17858,"nextInTime":17860,"topicId":17859,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve recently been accused of being an idealist in a recent discusson about unschooling my daughters.

No one ever seemed to <br/>\ndoubt my ability to homeschool - I guess because I was doing &#39;school <br/>\nat home&#39; but now my critics say that I&#39;m being too idealistic and my <br/>\nchildren will suffer because of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre unschoolers really more idealistic than others when it comes to <br/>\ncreating a different/better way in dealing with our children and <br/>\ntheir learning/growing?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI never thought that being idealistic was a bad thing, but I&#39;m <br/>\nhaving some doubts.  It (radical unschool) is much harder than <br/>\nreward/punishment system I used to use.  Unschooling is much more <br/>\nenjoyable than &#39;school at home&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you ever doubt yourself?  How do you deal with critics who claim <br/>\nyou are too much of an idealist and you are damaging your children <br/>\nbecause they won&#39;t be able to live in the real world?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nCara :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17899,"nextTopicId":17874}}
