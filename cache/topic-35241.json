Never before has<br/>\nTorah been positioned as the most relevant educational force not only<br/>\nfor religion and personal development, but also for a new generation<br/>\nof digital thinkers: the under 25-year olds who I have called (using<br/>\nmy own under-25-year-old son&#39;s term) E-Geners, or the generation of<br/>\nexponential thinkers. I explain how nothing caters to the needs of<br/>\nthis generation better than an outstanding Torah education topped up<br/>\nwith world class Math and English. Armed with these skills, young<br/>\npeople could quickly qualify for any university entrance they please,<br/>\ngrow as Torah thought leaders, or become entrepreneurs in their own<br/>\nrights.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRunning Time: 0:56:22<br/>\nFile Size: 9.47 MB</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35232,"nextTopicId":35217}}
