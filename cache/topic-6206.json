Of course, as a<br/>\nchild, I opposed spanking.  When I had my first child I thought I should<br/>\nspank, it&#39;s all I knew.  I sat through education classes thinking my<br/>\nprofessors were just ignorant as they talked about &#39;alternatives to<br/>\nspanking.&#39;  But, after I had my other children spanking never was something<br/>\nthat I had to use.  My daughter, for example, doesn&#39;t even like to know that<br/>\nI am upset with her - it breaks her heart.  Can you imagine how she would<br/>\nreact to a spanking?  All children are different, I know.  But, looking back<br/>\nat WHY I spanked my son, it was usually for things he eventually outgrew.<br/>\nThat&#39;s very very sad to me as I look back, but many of his &quot;discipline&quot;<br/>\nproblems were really just because he was not mature.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read that God uses a &quot;rod of reproof&quot; or &quot;rod of discipline&quot; with us?<br/>\nBut, I&#39;ve never been physically hit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think of a shepherd&#39;s rod or staff, did the shepherd ever beat the sheep?<br/>\nI picture them guiding and not striking or &quot;striping.&quot;  I would also like to<br/>\nknow the exact context and the original Hebrew words to get more insight<br/>\ninto this scripture that is quoted as a reason to spank.  I am sure that if<br/>\nyou studied it more and in context, it wouldn&#39;t be properly used to support<br/>\nspanking of small children.  Children are children - how many times do they<br/>\nact the way they act because they are tired - frustrated?  You have to ask<br/>\nif the child is acting out because of a discipline problem or are they<br/>\nacting out because of their immaturity?  And saying, &quot;NO&quot; is not bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope no one ever makes it common place to use the bible as an excuse to do<br/>\nviolence - using the bible to back up violent acts?

I do not <br/>\nknow any orthodox Jews (orthodox meaning living strickly by the law, <br/>\nwhich is what the old testament is, law; the new testament is grace). <br/>\nI have an opinion and please let it be well noted that this is my <br/>\nopinion and not fact and I am not proposing it to be so. My opinion <br/>\nis that Christianity is meant to be evangalistic. That is to say that <br/>\nChristians who earnestly believe that Christ died for everyones sin, <br/>\nand belief in Him is the only way to heaven; we can not work our way <br/>\nthere or ever be good enough to earn it, believe that they should <br/>\nshare that with everyone. The different way people go about doing <br/>\nthat is not always right, Christian like or kind, and for that I <br/>\napologize but fundamentaly that is what Christians are asked by <br/>\nChrist to do, share the good news of the Gospel. Jews are not <br/>\nevangalistic, they do not believe that Christ was the messiah and so <br/>\ntherefore there is no need to bring anyone to their faith. As I said <br/>\nbefore, many &quot;Christians&quot; go about &quot;evangalizing&quot; all the wrong ways <br/>\nand therby give the rest of us a very bad name but in my opinion that <br/>\nis why you probably hear more about what Christians believe on <br/>\ndifferent subjects than you do Jewish people. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would really like to share one thing though while we are on the <br/>\nsubject of spanking children and it&#39;s relationship to Christianity <br/>\nand God. It is also said in the bible, &quot;And you fathers, do not <br/>\nprovoke your children anger...&quot; Eph 6:4 (New Testament) This is the <br/>\napostle Pauls&#39; advice to fathers emphasizing patience. In this verse <br/>\nJesus describes, just as the heavenly Father, loves unconditionally, <br/>\nforgives, without strings attached, and gives abundatly, so should <br/>\nwe  as earthly fathers (and mothers). If a parent is spanking out of <br/>\nanger they are provoking their children to anger and that is not <br/>\nbiblical and not what God is asking of in the previously mentioned <br/>\nscripture, &quot;spare the rod&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel MacIntyre <br/>\n&lt;daniel.macintyre@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have a stupid question.
