Right now Riley (9) is touching floam for the first time, deciding it is sick. He is also watching Endurance Tehachapi. Tessa (6) is in the bath, as a distraction from yelling at her brother. She wanted to watch Sponge Bob, but really, she needs to wind down and sleep, so I am helping steer her to a safe calm place. I asked her if she wanted to take food coloring in there with her. Guess where I got that idea (the post before). Ashley, my 11 year old who goes to school her choice, is doing homework after 2.5 hours gymnastics. Riley is now stoking the fire also. Oh, Tessa is out of the tub, drying off to play play with floam. Floam has been wanted here since last Nov. and I just couldn&#39;t spend the money at the time. I found a single container yesterday, so we are finally experiencing floam.
