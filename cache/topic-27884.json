You can get worldwide news by simply connecting the Wii to the internet (if you have a network set up in your house it&#39;s free and REALLY simple).  My DH and DS set ours up a few days ago, and we&#39;ve had our system for about a month.  DS (11) will jump on the Wii and surf around looking at the news.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe news articles are set up like a newspaper (you can change font size, etc).  And the really cool thing?  On one side of the screen is the article while the other half is devoted to a map showing where the news orginated.  You can go all over the world map just looking for news.  It is really quite cool...and &quot;educational&quot; if you are needing to pitch that at all. ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll three of us in the family have Wii motes (the controllers) and have had a blast with Wii Sports.  Another nifty little game is &quot;Wii Play.&quot;  It has 9 different mini games and comes with a Wii mote.  The game by itself wouldn&#39;t be worth the $50 price tag, but if you are needing an extra controller this is a good way to go.  You get the controller (they cost $40) and then the game.  Not a bad little deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":147745368,"authorName":"Lesley Cross","from":"&quot;Lesley Cross&quot; &lt;lcross@...&gt;","profile":"decldc1992","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: &#39;Educational&#39; video games feedback?","postDate":"1195795315","msgId":27978,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZDkwMWM4MmQ5MCRjMzlkMzZlMCQzNTAxYThjMEBsZXNsZXlwYz4="},"prevInTopic":27970,"nextInTopic":27996,"prevInTime":27977,"nextInTime":27979,"topicId":27884,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have 2 Leapsters in our house (though I think the older one just kicked the bucket) which happened first because we had trouble finding games my middle","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-145691897\">We have 2 Leapsters in our house (though I think the older one just kicked<br/>\nthe bucket) which happened first because we had trouble finding games my<br/>\nmiddle child could play on her own at the age of 5.  We already had a GBA<br/>\nand DS in the house.as well as every previous Game Boy system.  It turned<br/>\nout that her favorite game was &quot;Mr. Pencil&#39;s Learn to Draw and Write&quot; which<br/>\nsounds horrible, but has some art components that she loved.  The other<br/>\ngames were too dry  and instructional in nature, even though they had<br/>\ncharacters and stories she liked.  Last year we ended up getting a second<br/>\nLeapster because our youngest was continually wanting to play with her<br/>\nsister&#39;s when her sister wanted to use it too- plus we didn&#39;t have a whole<br/>\nlot of other ideas of what relatives could get for a 2yo (who has 2 older<br/>\nsiblings and a house full of toys already!).  For her we got Finding Nemo,<br/>\nwhich is one of her favorite movies, and the cartridge was supposed to be<br/>\nmore of an interactive storybook.  They still both seemed to prefer Mr.<br/>\nPencil.  The younger one will also play the Disney Princess game and<br/>\nrecently has taken to Dora the Explorer.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the newer games have improved a bit as far as having less dry<br/>\neducational &quot;identify the letter&quot; kinds of things and being more open ended,<br/>\nbut I&#39;m really not speaking from a place of having played the games myself.<br/>\nLet me see if I can gather up what I have, try to play them a bit and see if<br/>\nI can give a better review.  My youngest seems to actually like some letter<br/>\nidentification sorts of things and while I think it&#39;s unnecessary for her<br/>\nfuture learning, her enjoyment is the most important thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I&#39;m all for helping my kids with their games, we&#39;ve found it easier to<br/>\ndo that on the tv console systems than the handheld ones.  Plus if they want<br/>\nhelp, they want it to be minimal (ie. to read for them),  which is why we<br/>\nwere aiming for something they could do independently.  In the few cases<br/>\nthey want me to get through a part of a game for them,  they like it a lot<br/>\nmore when they can see it while I&#39;m playing it.  Maybe try a Game Cube if<br/>\nthere are budget restrictions to work within (the games can later be played<br/>\non a Wii) .  Or a PS2.  There are a lot of great, affordable games for<br/>\nyounger players on the PS2.   I personally love Barbie Horse Adventures,<br/>\nthough I&#39;m SO not a Barbie kind of girl.

You don&#39;t need to play Brain AGE ( Which I do). My ds plays his Super Mario Games and has learned a lot from it. Fro  reading and writing to math to much more. <br/>\nHaving said that my ds says he does like his vTech ( maybe plays 20 minutes every couple of months).&#92;<br/>\nHe plays for fun and not because they are educational.<br/>\nWe also have the Wii system and its a lot of fun for all ages.<br/>\nYou can go to any GameStop and play with the Nintendo DS to try it out.<br/>\nI invested a lot of money on VTech and I think it is not worth it.<br/>\nAnd by the way they do have a handheld VTech. I have one and my system has the one that goes on the TV both sucked in our experience.<br/>\nAlex<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Adrean Clark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adrean@...\">adrean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 22, 2007 12:32:31 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] &#39;Educational&#39; video games feedback?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like my mom came around to the idea of homeschooling quicker <br/>\nthan I thought.
