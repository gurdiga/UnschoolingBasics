Answer:  I&#39;ll get money and buy myself some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat the friend even gave your daughter one bubblegum stick, shows me she likes to share. Having to give more than she was prepared to makes a child loath to do so next time and forcing her to share perpetrates her sense of ownership. YOU don&#39;t like others telling you what to do with your stuff. Children have as much a right to decide what to do with their property as you do.  Learning to accept a no is part of life. Learning how to handle it with grace is what you can teach your children by example.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding rules and principles, my mom and I talked about that and came to the obvious conclusion that rules grow out of principles. The principle of not hurting each other, taking care of each other, and being considerate of others needs may result in the rule of not slamming doors when fingers could be caught in them. The rule of not fighting at the table stems from the principle that stress while eating results in indigestion..  <br/>\nThe trick is not to make rules for the sake of having them, but to understand the principles behind them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve enjoyed this extremly and thank my mom for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlotte<br/>\ndaughter of Ulrike<br/>\nfrom Namibia - somewhere in Africa<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":295439124,"authorName":"wisdomalways5","from":"&quot;wisdomalways5&quot; &lt;wisdom1133@...&gt;","profile":"wisdomalways5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: A Few Specific Situations","postDate":"1196143115","msgId":28038,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZpZ2JtYitnaWRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZpZzF1ais4anBqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28037,"nextInTopic":28044,"prevInTime":28037,"nextInTime":28039,"topicId":28037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
