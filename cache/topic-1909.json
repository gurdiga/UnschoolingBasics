As some of you know I am very interested<br/>\nin discourses and language use.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurs to me that many people see the word &quot;boundaries&quot; and think<br/>\n&quot;limits&quot;, as if they were interchangeable. Maybe they are. But...I wonder if<br/>\nin Unschooling and how these ideas are applying to the personal<br/>\nresponsibility thread it is more helpful to consider the idea that<br/>\nboundaries come *from* a person - like the fences if you are standing in the<br/>\nmiddle of a field, whereas limits (or setting limits) are the person<br/>\nstanding *outside* the field trying to enclose the fence around someone<br/>\nelse. All we may have the right to do is enclose our personal field<br/>\n(hopefully with gates!) although we can/should help our children with their<br/>\nconstructions....<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
