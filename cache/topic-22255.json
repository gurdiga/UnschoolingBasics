As I mentioned before I am new to unschooling<br/>\nand wanting to give things a different course of<br/>\naction. My son (12) has a habit of teasing<br/>\n(unrelentingly) his sister (5). This has been going on<br/>\nfor the last 2 years that he has been home from<br/>\nschool. Of course for the last 2 years we have not<br/>\nbeen unschooling, and my son and I have suffered in<br/>\nour relationship because of the situation. It is<br/>\nalways that he&#39;s the &quot;bad one&quot;  because he&#39;s the<br/>\nteaser, and she is &quot;the victim&quot; because she is at the<br/>\nreceiving end, crying or screaming. It has been a<br/>\nvicious circle and I know he resents her in a way<br/>\nbecause she gets all of our &quot;good attention&quot; because<br/>\nshe is not the one teasing, and he gets our &quot;bad<br/>\nattention&quot; because we are always fussing about why he<br/>\nis teasing her. It has been *very* stressful for me,<br/>\nand the regular talking about it to him doesn&#39;t seem<br/>\nto help. We&#39;ll have a nice conversation about it one<br/>\nnight and the next day it&#39;s the same old thing. I end<br/>\nup being very emotional over it, and am upset alot of<br/>\nthe time by it. I also am pregnant and don&#39;t think it<br/>\nis so good for me to be this upset all the time. Help<br/>\nplease. Thanks so much!
