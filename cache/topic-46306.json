People will naturally push and challenge themselves - some more than others - and some people are  naturally competitive, too. It&#39;s not uncommon for someone with a goal to set him or herself up with situations where they&#39;ll struggle and even fail over and over out of a desire to do More - but it isn&#39;t natural to want punishment, that&#39;s a conflation of two different things. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;What I do stress is the importance of having at least one good friend to talk to. It might comfort him to know that at least one friend understands what he&#39;s going through.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping a child find his or her true peer group (or even One good friend, as min says) is a good way to set a kid up with an environment that provides the right kind of challenges and support. Its Hard to be the only kid who values Xyz - swimming or sewing or crossword puzzles or whatever - with no-one else to bounce ideas off, no-one to help you climb to that next level of skillfulness. <br/>\n<br/>\nCompetence is a driving motivation for humans - we Want to be skillful in whatever we choose to do. Its easier to accomodate that with a toddler than with a &quot;tween&quot; though. Part of unschooling is going beyond &quot;being your child&#39;s best teacher&quot; and seeing yourself as more of a solution center for finding more resources. Other people are fantastic resources!

He doesn&#39;t have a ton of friends in the area and because I am not much of a virtual nut, I have a hard time thinking about possible online friends. Also, I have thought about getting him involved in other activities, not necessarily age-peer groups, but with three other kids in the house younger than him it just seems to be put on the back burner. I need to get more on board with your idea. I asked him today about starting a science &quot;club&quot; with a girl friend of his that also loves science and he got real excited. I called her mom and we agreed to start next week. I figure this might be something he is interested in. He was in a Lego League but unfortunately had a rough experience with it and doesn&#39;t want to do it again, but I am still encouraging him, especially if we can join a different group (the leaders were quite disrespectful of the children). <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you hit the nail on the head saying he feels like the &quot;odd man out&quot;. He has often eluded to that, but I have a personality that makes friends with a cardboard box, so I wasn&#39;t seeing it as it is for him until you just pointed it out. Thanks! Sometimes it is hard to remove our own journeys or perspectives and put ourselves in their shoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are going to the UWG conference in May if anyone else is going. Maybe he could meet some kids that play Halo or other online games and get connected. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat great insight I have already received!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Heather in Cincy&quot; &lt;hmschleidt@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;He also does not like sports very much and feels like he has a hard time making friends because they always want to play sports and he would rather do science experiments or art projects or build with legos. <br/>\n&gt; ***************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It seems like the biggest issue is he&#39;s the &quot;odd man out&quot; and its wrecking his self esteem.

I was on the website last night at 3 am trying to figure out how to afford that AND the UWG conference in one year.  We were just in Dallas with friends and want to go back in July and visit them (they are WAY not unschoolers and WAY not like-minded), but there is a wonderful friendship history there and we love each others&#39; families a lot, so we will stay with them in July, but I don&#39;t want to stay with them for the conference as I would like to be in the hotel.  My hubby is out of town right now but when he gets back I am going to ask him about going to Dallas in September.  I&#39;ll let you know if we are coming.

We moved in to help them out, so<br/>\nbefore moving in I had a talk with them each, separately.  I didn&#39;t attack<br/>\nthem about it, but I made it clear that Parker and I (with input from<br/>\nDraven&#39;s father) were raising him the way we saw fit.  If they had any<br/>\nproblems they were free to discuss them with me privately, but please don&#39;t<br/>\nmake comments to Draven, or in front of Draven about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know they don&#39;t like that his sleep schedule isn&#39;t typical, and they don&#39;t<br/>\nlike that he spends a significant amount of time on video games.  It really<br/>\nbothers them that we don&#39;t make him help around the house and that he&#39;s<br/>\nallowed to say no when we ask.  My mom is firmly on board with &quot;Your kid,<br/>\nyour choice&quot; but my stepfather has a harder time with it.  He has<br/>\noccasionally caught Draven alone and given him a mini-lecture on what to do<br/>\nor not to do when taking things to the kitchen.  I&#39;ve reminded him multiple<br/>\ntimes that I&#39;d rather him speak to me about things that are bothering him<br/>\nabout Draven, he&#39;s getting better about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my father it&#39;s another story.  He is famous for quizzing everyone<br/>\n(including adult friends) on pointless bits of knowledge and going into<br/>\n&quot;teacher mode&quot; when they don&#39;t know the answer.  Draven knows this is just<br/>\nhis style and therefore sticks with me when we&#39;re over there so I can<br/>\nintervene.  When he is occasionally alone with him Draven has learned to<br/>\neither listen to the lecture but not take it to heart, or politely change<br/>\nthe subject.  He loves my father and understands that it&#39;s just his<br/>\npersonality and not something personal with Draven.  I don&#39;t tell my father<br/>\nmuch about unschooling and he&#39;s (finally) stopped asking.  We know we won&#39;t<br/>\nagree so we make it a point to avoid the topic altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there&#39;s two different ways I&#39;ve handled it.  One is up front and direct,<br/>\nthe other is basically agreeing to disagree and both involve being there to<br/>\nprotect Draven.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thu, Mar 10, 2011 at 12:59 AM, Heather in Cincy<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hmschleidt@...\">hmschleidt@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  My kids love their grandparents, so I am going to have to figure out how<br/>\n&gt; and what to say and stand up for them while maintaining the relationship for<br/>\n&gt; them.

He doesn&#39;t have a ton of friends in the area and because I am not much of a virtual nut, I have a hard time thinking about possible online friends.  Also, I have thought about getting him involved in other activities, not necessarily age-peer groups, but with three other kids in the house younger than him it just seems to be put on the back burner.  I need to get more on board with your idea.  I asked him today about starting a science &quot;club&quot; with a girl friend of his that also loves science and he got real excited.  I called her mom and we agreed to start next week.  I figure this might be something he is interested in.  He was in a Lego League but unfortunately had a rough experience with it and doesn&#39;t want to do it again, but I am still encouraging him, especially if we can join a different group (the leaders were quite disrespectful of the children).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you hit the nail on the head saying he feels like the &quot;odd man out&quot;.  He has often eluded to that, but I have a personality that makes friends with a cardboard box, so I wasn&#39;t seeing it as it is for him until you just pointed it out.  Thanks!  Sometimes it is hard to remove our own journeys or perspectives and put ourselves in their shoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are going to the UWG conference in May if anyone else is going.

I was looking at a mirror of my past few weeks and I realized that I have been very engrossed in getting a few things done around the house and haven&#39;t really been very connected.  I usually am, but we were out of town at Christmas for 4 weeks, then out of town again for a week, then out of town again for another week.

One of the best things for our now-15 year old always-unschooling son, has been finding him individuals and groups that are a great fit with what he wants to do, who appreciate unschooled exploration rather than a standard instructional approach and are a good match personality-wise. <br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, this seldom happens at random! For us it&#39;s turned out to be mostly adult males -- either young and bursting with passion and energy (25ish) or old (wise and seasoned, lots of patience and not competitive with a child.)  These relationships have started out as paid one-on-one tutoring (in order of his enthusiasms from about age 10,  remote control airplanes, dance, singing, acting, bagpipes, French which was a retired woman, and starting tomorrow when we meet &quot;Martin&quot; in person, saxophone) and grown to be personal friendships as well. Through these targeted shared interests with a structured schedule of getting together he can count on, he naturally tends to meet other compatible individuals including a few age peers over time, and they all then share cast parties, rehearsals and special weekend events of various kinds. A few of those have recently become FaceBook and online videogame friends as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut honestly, he never did the usual playdates, park days, birthday parties etc. with age peers nor seemed to want that, and he never had proximity friends in the neighborhood (none of us do -- people stay inside here or go out in their own cars.) He went to his birthday party just last month, at a pizza place, a girl he has been dancing with for three years and another boy from dance, plus two of her school friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good insight!

She did about the middle third of it and was then reading independently enough to suit herself and took off from there. I wonder if something like that would help your son. I think 100 Easy Lessons is way too easy for your son but maybe he could pick out something he feels would be useful. And if he wants to practice writing and do spelling exercises, he could set himself up on a schedule to do that. Not to abandon him in his efforts but if he wants and needs these activities to be scheduled (right now anyway) being part of that process (selecting the material, setting a time to do it, reminding himself to do it (does he want you to remind him?), doing it, etc.) then he could be involved as much as possible and really own what&#39;s going into his own head. And when he wants to stop doing all that (even when the books are only half used and the handwriting practice sheets are neglected), that&#39;s OK too.<br/>\n<br/>\n*********FWIW, my DD spent the next 9 years reading her way through the local libraries and has now taken herself to a charter high school at the local community college and is doing very well.

Hunger can play a big role in inability to deal emotionally, <br/>\ntiredness, thirst, boredom. Look to those things and see if you can direct some <br/>\nof your desire to fix, your wanting to help towards improving his basic needs. <br/>\nBoth Simon and Linnaea have enormously different responses to things when they <br/>\nare hungry or tired. 10 can be developmentally intense. He&#39;s getting ready to <br/>\nhit puberty, he&#39;s probably starting to put on a bit of extra weight in <br/>\npreparation for the impending series of growth spurts and the other series of <br/>\nchanges that are about to be initiated. He&#39;s appetite is probably growing out of <br/>\nproportion with your expectations. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBe more present. If his lashing out seems to come in moments when you are doing <br/>\nsomething else, try and do those things when you are more certain of his mood. I <br/>\nam fairly adept at turning a tense moment. Although, sometimes I end up ramping <br/>\nup the whole thing. But, if both Simon and Linnaea are in a grumbly, grouchy <br/>\nsort of mood my presence can make a massive difference to the way they move <br/>\nthrough that period with each other. It is much, much better if I am in the <br/>\ngroup at the beginning than if I come in later to try and mediate the peace <br/>\naccord. It also helps if when I can feel tension if I bring in a platter of food <br/>\nand some drinks. That can physically change the environment enough that the <br/>\nmoment of tension passes more quickly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He just recently lashed out at me screaming that it is my fault that he can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;&gt;spell. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you ever grab at something when you are in a fight to justify feeling bad? <br/>\nI&#39;ve done it. I&#39;ve done it a fair bit. I&#39;m feeling low and grumpy and I&#39;m kind <br/>\nof picking fights and to justify it I come up with something relatively <br/>\ntangential. If you&#39;ve been fussing, even supportively, about his spelling, he <br/>\nmay be grasping at something that he knows will get your attention. There is a <br/>\nhuge desire to not be at fault for being in a bad mood. Being able to shift that <br/>\nblame on to something else doesn&#39;t really help, but maybe for a moment one feels <br/>\nless accountable. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people never spell really well. Some people just never get an eye for how <br/>\nto spell, never can feel when e comes before i or i comes before e. I find that <br/>\nI am less certain about words than I used to be. But spell check is an amazing <br/>\nthing. I don&#39;t have to be perfect, I can google it (or goggle it as my spell <br/>\nchecker would have it). What if your son is among those folks for whom spelling <br/>\nwill never be an easy thing? Will working with different programmes just make <br/>\nhim feel less confident, more sure that he can&#39;t learn without schooling and <br/>\neven with schooling he&#39;s just incapable? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than work to implement a holistic solution for the spelling problem, <br/>\noffer him lists of words that he thinks will come up when he&#39;s writing things <br/>\nfor Cubs Scouts or wherever. Target the problem with greater efficiency instead <br/>\nof going at it with a general desire to improve his spelling. What does he need <br/>\nto write for Cub Scouts? Are there ways that you and he can do a directed study <br/>\nof the words that are likely to come up? He could carry around a little notebook <br/>\nwith the words in it and review them when he wanted or you could play hangman <br/>\nwith that word list. And handwriting improves with practice, or with other kinds <br/>\nof pencil and paper work, things like drawing. You could get him a Wacom tablet <br/>\nfor the computer and he could play around with that. We have one and I think I&#39;m <br/>\nthe only person who ever really used it. Now it just gathers dust. But maybe <br/>\nyour son would use it more than we have. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is that the spelling thing isn&#39;t really the pivotal point for his mood, <br/>\nthough. My guess is that it is a scapegoat. He feels bad and he doesn&#39;t want to <br/>\nfeel bad. He&#39;s grouchy and he doesn&#39;t want to be grouchy.

There were people who were critical of that, called it &quot;storming off,&quot; in a negative way. But, I knew that it was a big step forward for her and I&#39;d stop others from following her and insisting that she should deal with the problem immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra talks about how different bodies probably handle adrenaline differently. For some it hits them fast and furious, for others it is slow to flow, but also slow to dissipate. Roxana says, and always said, that her anger took her by surprise, that she really didn&#39;t have enough warning signals to stop and make any other decision. Even trying to <br/>\nbreathe first seemed impossible to her. She&#39;d be already furious and shouting or saying things she later regretted, at the exact same time that another part of her brain would be telling her to stop and breathe first. Looking back (she&#39;s 22 now and has full self-control), I think Roxana&#39;s fight or flight body chemical responses were super super quick and intense. She was little and when she felt wronged, it felt like being attacked to her, and she had an instant and super strong <br/>\nphysiological reaction - she was immediately awash in &quot;fight&quot; mode chemicals. Switching to &quot;flight&quot; was doable because those same chemicals can lead to that option. Switching to &quot;calmly discuss the problem&quot; just wasn&#39;t a realistic option when all those fight or flight chemicals were raging in her body.<br/>\n<br/>\nRox&#39;s sisters learned quickly to let her leave and then let her return without much comment. Sometimes, though, she&#39;d have a problem with friends, who would get their moms involved and then the mothers were insistent that she should stay and &quot;talk it out&quot; right then and there and they would get really pushy about it. There were times I said very firmly and clearly (to moms, mostly, but maybe a few times to kids), &quot;Please do NOT follow Roxana when she needs to get away. Let her go on her own and leave her alone. She&#39;ll come back when she feels ready to work things out.&quot; I stood guard a few times at park days - Rox was off on her own, crying and very upset, and I prevented anyone from going to <br/>\nher and insisting she &quot;talk about it.&quot; I know for a fact that there were parents there who thought I was cruel not to go to her myself, but I knew she needed space around her to recover. Looking back, I think it was that she needed a certain amount of time for the fight or flight chemicals to dissipate.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s a great 22-year-old now - I know her friends would describe her as even-tempered and sweet. She still does have a very very strong sense of justice - she feels it strongly when things seem unfair - it infuriates her still. But she can cope. She has perspective. She &quot;feels&quot; it but doesn&#39;t blow up over it. Example would be that her registration window <br/>\nat her university was Wednesday morning. They get 2 hours to register, then their window closes and they can&#39;t make any changes until just before school starts in the fall - no adding or dropping or changing classes. There was a glitch in the computer system during her window and it didn&#39;t recognize that she&#39;d met the prerequisites for a series of courses she needs to take to graduate. So it would not let her register. She emailed support, they emailed her back that they&#39;d fied it, but they took two hours to do it and her window closed, so she couldn&#39;t get into the classes. They&#39;re now all full. That kind of unfair frustration is exactly the kind of thing that used to completely throw her - something not her fault, frustrating, and unfair. But, this time, she anticipated they might take too long to fix it and so she looked around for some <br/>\nother courses to take, found some others that seem interesting to her, and really more than made the best of it. Ended up with some classes she would otherwise not have taken and she&#39;s looking forward to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRox doesn&#39;t let everybody see all her intensity - all the strong feelings she still has. She keeps it inside and only a few people even suspect it is there. She can still &quot;feel&quot; explosive about little things (to others) when they seem very unfair. She will excuse herself and go to the bathroom when people are playing a game and she thinks some decision was a bad one. I think her biochemistry has changed, some, with maturity, but mostly she has learned various strategies to handle it.<br/>\nSo - for those of you with quick-trigger kids who don&#39;t seem to have self-control, I guess I&#39;m saying do the best you can to help them now in ways that work best for them. Don&#39;t assume that helping them understand how to problem solve, for example, is useful. Roxana understood quite well how to problem solve. That wasn&#39;t her problem at all and all <br/>\nattempts to help her understand it just caused her greater frustration and made things worse. The most important thing I did was really listen to Roxana and really pay attention to what seemed to help and what didn&#39;t. Enlist the child&#39;s help - it isn&#39;t like the kid wants things to be hard - kids want to be happy, too.”<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"lylaw","from":"&quot;lylaw&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: 10 year old boy anger issues","postDate":"1299635900","msgId":46311,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzMkFDOTI2RTBDRDQ0NkNCNDYzOEQ1QTkzOTQ1MTc5QEx5bGFQQz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlsNmg0dCtoN25mQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlsNmg0dCtoN25mQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46310,"nextInTopic":46312,"prevInTime":46310,"nextInTime":46312,"topicId":46306,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I *highly* recommend that book!     <br/>\nmy son continues to surprise and amaze me with his changes in willingness to try new things, his ability to adapt and adjust to new situations and to overcome disappointment and frustration, especially in this last year or so (12) – 9-10 is a very tumultuous age for many kids.<br/>\nhave you read “the explosive child”?  that’s a good one – if your husband will read it too, it might really help.  it’s by a doctor, and very very respectful of kids who have what he calls “lagging skills” in social / emotional regulation....I don’t  particularly like the term lagging, but he looks at it as something that needs tremendous support, not punishment or domination, and even though it’s not an unschooling, or even a home schooling, book, it can be really helpful for any parent struggling to figure out how to deal with intense reactions.  his web site is www.livesinthebalance.org. ross greene, the author, talks about parents needing to be their children’s “surrogate frontal lobe” while the child’s matures.  <br/>\nalso – how do you respond when the issues like the one with his brother talking under his breath come up?    in my experience prevention and being extremely proactive at the first sign of discord is essential for kids who tend to go from 0 to 60 very rapidly.    pam sorooshian wrote a wonderful post about that, but I cannot find it anywhere – does anyone else have that?  <br/>\nalso, when he blames you, I know it’s hard, but try not to take it personally, in an affronted way.  lots of empathy and understanding for the underlying feelings and frustration can help a lot, to soothe and calm him, so he can get to a more rational, comfortable place.  when he’s lashing out, remember that HE feels bad.  <br/>\nlyla<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"lylaw","from":"&quot;lylaw&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] 10 year old boy anger issues","postDate":"1299634352","msgId":46310,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhFMDdEOTRGRDM4NDQxMjk4NkE3RTg4REQxNDc1RjE4QEx5bGFQQz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrem56QnlNYm9PRitvSFdndnUzMEQrUT02eFBVSDU9Q0NFXzhwM0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlsNjdxYityMjk0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaWt6bnpCeU1ib09GK29IV2d2dTMwRCtRPTZ4UFVINT1DQ0VfOHAzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46309,"nextInTopic":46311,"prevInTime":46309,"nextInTime":46311,"topicId":46306,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... my son is now 12.5 but at 9-10 and beyond was very much as you describe your son.

To be honest, recently he spent time with grandma and grandpa who are disapproving of our methods and make &quot;sly&quot; comments.  I told him this last time that he never had to go over there if he felt uncomfortable and then he started to cry and said he liked going over there but it was hard to hear them say that he only plays video games all day (he does play a lot, but he is very interested in other things just not in what they think is important).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI asked him why he wanted to spell and he says he is embarrassed at events (Cub Scouts, etc) where they have to spell things and he can&#39;t spell or write (he says he has terrible handwriting which REALLY is NOT true).  I always offer ahead of time to help him with things later or help him spell if I am there  but he doesn&#39;t want people seeing him need help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, we are not new to unschooling, but of course, like many, we have fallen off the horse occasionally and worked on &quot;subjects&quot; from time to time.  Over the last year we have gotten pretty solid at unschooling.  My kids have never been to school.  Unschooling fits my ds7&#39;s personality, but my ds10 is always questioning himself and comparing himself with other people, even though we don&#39;t do that to him at all.  In fact, I do all I can to point out his strengths.  He also does not like sports very much and feels like he has a hard time making friends because they always want to play sports and he would rather do science experiments or art projects or build with legos.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate the questions because it makes me look harder at the reasons behind it.  I also feel much of this is self-imposed.  He is sooo hard on himself and we don&#39;t put any pressure on him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe somebody has a suggestion of a spelling website or program that makes it fun and I can ask him if he would like to try it.  He is a more &quot;structure&quot; child and wants to have programs to learn.  He asked me two weeks ago to buy him a math program so he could get better at math, even though I have never mentioned that need.  In fact, he is probably at &quot;state&quot; standards for his grade level except for the memorization of multiplication and I joke with him all the time that he is about to surpass my math skills.  We know he will get math when he needs it.  I know that about spelling too and try and emphasize this, but that is not good enough for him, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why do you think he &quot;has a lot of anger inside him?&quot; Not how does he act but what do you think causes/caused the anger?

Obviously you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1988828331\">It has always helped me to remember that being angry and out of control<br/>\nis sometimes scarier for the child than it is for the people around him.<br/>\n Obviously you need to physically protect those around him, but at the same<br/>\ntime realize he&#39;s feeling very vulnerable while he&#39;s that angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might also help to examine your fears.  Fearing that your husband will<br/>\nreturn to &quot;traditional&quot; parenting, as well as other fears, will make it<br/>\nharder to address the situation at hand.  I&#39;m not sure how to explain this<br/>\nclearly but basically your fears about your sons anger will feed into his<br/>\nfears about being angry and his fears are what are making him angry in the<br/>\nfirst place.  I hope that makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nFear of being made fun of (the younger sibling mumbling) fear of not being<br/>\nequal to peers (not being able to spell).  From the examples you&#39;re giving<br/>\nit sounds like his anger stems from an underlying fear.  That may or may not<br/>\nhelp you find a better way to handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how to handle the issue with siblings (maybe someone with more<br/>\nthan one child can handle that part), but I have some ideas for the<br/>\nspelling.<br/>\n<br/>\nOffer him plenty of opportunities to spell things.  Maybe get him a keyboard<br/>\nphone for texting with you and your husband, and even friends.  Draven (my<br/>\n11y/o) has one we bought for around $50, and we have him on an unlimited<br/>\nplan through Metro PCS for $40 a month.  There are other cell phone<br/>\nproviders that have full keyboard phones cheaply with lower monthly plans.<br/>\n See if he&#39;s interested in chatting with other unschoolers (Draven may like<br/>\nto e-mail with him about games).  Be available whenever he&#39;s typing to spell<br/>\nanything he needs spelled, and do it without judgement.  Draven recently got<br/>\nthe chatpad for the Xbox 360 and uses it to send text messages through the<br/>\ngames.  Provide lots of handy dictionaries (they have ones that are<br/>\nspecifically for spelling) but don&#39;t say &quot;look it up&quot; just have it available<br/>\nin case he wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also work on his self esteem by pointing out (not when he&#39;s angry)<br/>\nlots of things he is good at.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know those things don&#39;t directly deal with the anger, however they deal<br/>\nwith the underlying problem causing the anger and that may be a better long<br/>\nterm solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n-- <br/>\nunschoolinguntitled.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Mar 8, 2011 at 4:41 PM, Heather in Cincy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hmschleidt@...\">hmschleidt@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been reading on this list for over two years but almost never post.<br/>\n&gt; I am need of some serious direction.

I am need of some serious direction.  My oldest is showing some high level anger issues and is lashing out in the form of screaming (really, at the top of his lungs!) at people when he gets frustrated.  I&#39;ll admit that I recently lost it with him and did not treat him respectfully or peacefully, but I apologized and we talk quite often about this.  Example:  He was playing XBOX with his brother and his brother mumbled something under his breath.  My oldest asked him to repeat what he said but he didn&#39;t want to.  So my ds10 started screaming at him telling him he had to tell him what he said or he was going to hit him.  It was so bad, I was on the phone with a company trying to pay a bill and I had to just excuse myself and hang up because I didn&#39;t know what kind of danger someone was in.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, he isn&#39;t a loud kid, but he has a lot of anger inside him and he has very low self-confidence.  He just recently lashed out at me screaming that it is my fault that he can&#39;t spell.  We unschool, but I also try to encourage him to use online resources or programs if he feels they might help him achieve goals.  For example, I bought All About Spelling because he asked me to teach him how to spell.  That was over one year ago and he wanted to learn how, asked for a few lessons, then quit.  I never pressured him or anything but I am always encouraging him to learn a few words when he wants to write something out.  I also always spell for him when he asks.  Then, suddenly he just started screaming at me the other day and crying because he can&#39;t spell.  According to him, it is all my fault.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just a few examples.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to continue to treat him respectfully but he is stressing out the rest of the family.  Some of the younger kids don&#39;t want to play with him as much and my husband, although he supports respectful/peaceful parenting, is about to return to traditional methods with him if we don&#39;t find a way to either work through this or shift our paradigm of viewing his anger.  I love him deeply, in some ways, maybe as a favorite because he is my first, but right now I am not enjoying my time with him because it almost always ends up in a yelling match where someone else is doing something wrong - it is never him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp!  I really want some advice - is it me?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46330,"nextTopicId":46265}}
