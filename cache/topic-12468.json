I would be <br/>\ndriving all over L.A. listening to books on tape, or some fairly good radio <br/>\nstations with my kids, and we would often be away from a computer until late at <br/>\nnight.  Then, I&#39;d be falling asleep in front of the screen, trying to keep up <br/>\nwith the latest hot topics.  Always wished I could be listening to posts from <br/>\nmy favorite lists, or have someone reading articles from my favorite newspapers <br/>\nand magazines.  I love NPR, Air America, Pacifica, and Democracy Now, but <br/>\nsometimes I would rather hear about subjects that are closer to my daily life, to <br/>\nthe way that I am actually living. Unschooling podcasts would be great.  Of <br/>\ncourse, something like this might already exist.  There is so much private <br/>\npodcasting going on these days, it&#39;s hard to find all that is available. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a small podcasting studio here, in one of the artist&#39;s lofts <br/>\nbuildings downtown, called The Brewery.  They help folks do podcasting, teach about <br/>\nit, rent out the space, etc.  I&#39;ll see the guy tomorrow night, and ask him <br/>\nabout setting something up.  <br/>\n~Bird</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201330991,"authorName":"Queana","from":"&quot;Queana&quot; &lt;queana7@...&gt;","profile":"queanabruedal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Unschooling Podcast?","postDate":"1146008216","msgId":12468,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12471,"prevInTime":12467,"nextInTime":12469,"topicId":12468,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry for those who see this several times!
