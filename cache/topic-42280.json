I think though that one <br/>\nof the negative sides of the orthodox Jewish community is that they <br/>\noften take on the beliefs of the surrounding cultures (as we can see <br/>\nfrom Jews of all different origins practice their Judaism differently, <br/>\nsometimes having incorporated practices from the cultures around them <br/>\nover time).  There are many areas where I wonder why the community at <br/>\nlarge has taken on certain fundamental beliefs about &#39;facts&#39; - medical <br/>\npractice, raising children, nutrition choices, car culture, nuclear <br/>\nfamily homes, etc...  I see many families struggle with these things, <br/>\nand yet not reject them or look for an alternatives. But they are not <br/>\npart of the Torah, they are not &quot;Jewish&quot; values.  They are just the <br/>\npopular practices of our current culture.  I would love to see some <br/>\nchange... and I do!

That&#39;s how a parent has to speak: like a slow and constant<br/>\ndrip.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of the child as a crop. There are different ways of watering crops.<br/>\nYou can pour water on them with rotary sprinklers, a whirling deluge; or you<br/>\ncan conserve your energy and work on the roots, gently, through a network of<br/>\nconnections called drip irrigation, which was invented here in Israel. You<br/>\ncan drip on your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one day they will grow in the direction you have guided them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned this concept of gentle parenting recently when a woman told me<br/>\nsomething very important, something I wish I had known when I was parenting<br/>\nlittle kids. But it is still relevant for parenting older kids:<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of kids as a crop *You just keep saying it.* Whatever *it* is. Ad<br/>\nnauseum. You just keep saying the same thing. The kids don&#39;t have to buy it.<br/>\nThey don&#39;t have to do it. They don&#39;t even have to listen. But if you keep<br/>\nsaying it, eventually it will seep in. Maybe not now--maybe when they are<br/>\ntwenty. But they will hear your voice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that what a parent is, anyway, ultimately: a voice inside of a child?<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of our religion--how we say the same things over and over: the weekly<br/>\nTorah readings, the prayers. The hope is that those words one day will enter<br/>\nus, define us, change us--slowly.<br/>\n<br/>\nG-d, after all, created the world with words. And He didn&#39;t have to yell to<br/>\ncreate.<br/>\n<br/>\nG-d didn&#39;t have to yell to createThis gentle method takes a lot of pressure<br/>\noff of the parent. She doesn&#39;t have to get her way. She just has to define<br/>\nher way, describe her way, articulate her way, know her way; and just by<br/>\nuttering her way, she plants a seed within the child that can lead to<br/>\nmovement.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe usually think of movement as quick: quick obedience, rapid listening. But<br/>\nchildren aren&#39;t built for rapid response to their parents. How often it is<br/>\nthat they don&#39;t respond, at least not the way you want them to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when my kids were little I would ask them to stop screaming. I<br/>\nwould ask them again. I would tell them. And then I would scream at them *stop<br/>\nscreaming.* I would lose it. I was Crazy Mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as we moms grow up, we also learn. There is no need to force things. I<br/>\nlearned this lesson in a very painful way. My son was murdered when he was<br/>\nthirteen. Before he was killed, I used to force the matter at hand with my<br/>\nchildren. I wanted them to do what I wanted them to do. Now. Not later. Not<br/>\ntomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut losing a child makes you revaluate your priorities. Makes you reevaluate<br/>\neverything. You don&#39;t expect things to go your way. You don&#39;t expect. You<br/>\nknow that you can do your best and the worst can happen. All you can do is<br/>\ntry.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now when I hear parents yelling at their kids I am a little bit shocked.<br/>\nI used to get into crazy power struggles with my kids. I wanted them to<br/>\nclean their rooms and do their homework and brush their teeth and sit at the<br/>\ntable and go to sleep at a proper hour and I wanted them to obey me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe control I thought I had was falseAfter my son&#39;s murder, it was so clear<br/>\nthat the control I thought I had was false. I had no power. Now I was happy<br/>\nbecause they were alive. I truly appreciated them. I wanted to be with them,<br/>\njust to be with them. I didn&#39;t need them to listen to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing that the power struggles stopped. Now for me to get into a<br/>\npower struggle with a child is rare, very rare. Yes I occasionally lose it,<br/>\nbut I don&#39;t have to be right and I don&#39;t have to force my will. I can be<br/>\nlike water, dripping on a rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe great Sage and scholar Rabbi Akiva, a man who first studied the Torah<br/>\nwhen he was forty and had no confidence that he would be able to learn it,<br/>\nnoticed the way that water had hollowed a cavity in a rock. He said<br/>\nsomething to the effect that if gentle water could hollow a rock, then the<br/>\nwords of Torah (which are compared to water) could also penetrate him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur words are water and sometimes our children are rocks. But rocks can be<br/>\nsculpted.
