I felt it was <br/>\nimportant for the child to experience the bodily connections between <br/>\nfeeling they needed to go to the bathroom and going; I viewed this as an <br/>\nimportant stage in the potty learning process. The child picked out some <br/>\nspecial panties to wear and voila.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just went right to underwear at this transition stage--or no pants at <br/>\nall. I put down big canvas crib pads on the carpet where necessary, had <br/>\na potty in the playroom, cheerfully cleaned up accidents, got lots of <br/>\nuse out of my bissell spot cleaner, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hi Danielle!  I know you (well, by name) a bit from the Shine list, so hello to you and yours!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;m hoping you, and everyone here, can help me out.  We have some issues here with the potty, too.  I really like the advice above, it&#39;s pretty much what I&#39;ve done with all three older girls, but my youngest, Lolo is giving us a harder time.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Here&#39;s the deal:  Loryn is three (four in May) and has a diagnosis of autism.  More than that, really, is that she doesn&#39;t talk yet.  I mean, at all...at least, no speech with us.  She will sing Wiggles songs, or count with us, or repeat certain words (she likes animal names the best), and once in a while she&#39;ll use &quot;bye bye&quot; in correct context.  No Mama, Daddy, nurse, milk, and definitely no poop or pee. :-)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My question is:  would you recommend that I start potty-training Loryn the same way (i.e. getting rid of diapers, using pull-ups at park or co-op days, etc.)? She has shown no interest in going to the potty, except for one or two times, but she&#39;s off again (and running, and giggling) in a second or two.  Maybe I shouldn&#39;t even be worried about potty-training now?  I have to admit, some of this comes from pressure from family and friends, who have all KINDS of advice...&quot;If you get her off the tit...if you get her out of your bed...if you don&#39;t carry her, blah, blah, blah.  Seems these people think ignoring mother&#39;s instincts and children&#39;s needs can &quot;fix&quot; anything:  talking, potty-training, &quot;tantrums&quot;, even autism!  LOL Then again, with all that great advice from others (there&#39;s that sarcasm again!), I have to admit that it would just be easier (for ME, I know, not necessarily her) if Loryn WERE potty-trained.  And speech seems to be a big part of that for me...I have to admit, I&#39;m<br/>\n skeptical of EC...but I&#39;ve never tried it, so who knows.  And is it too late to go that route?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Many questions, lots of pondering...please excuse my rambling (it&#39;s 1:40 am here in the beautiful Shenandoah Valley), and my three youngest are up with me...Loryn and Ashlyn (also diagnosed with Autism) are playing a Blues Clues game on the computer, Tori (my 7 year old) is listening to Harry Potter on tape.  My oldest, Shelby (12) has deserted us, and is in her room re-arranging things, packing up Beanie Babies and American Girl dolls because she feels the need to have a &quot;teenage&quot; room.  I&#39;m about in tears over this, BTW...LOL...something she feels she needs to do.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Anyway, I learn so much from this group, so thanks in advance for any advice that you all can give.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks again,<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Paige  <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

I felt it was <br/>\nimportant for the child to experience the bodily connections between <br/>\nfeeling they needed to go to the bathroom and going; I viewed this as an <br/>\nimportant stage in the potty learning process. The child picked out some <br/>\nspecial panties to wear and voila.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just went right to underwear at this transition stage--or no pants at <br/>\nall. I put down big canvas crib pads on the carpet where necessary, had <br/>\na potty in the playroom, cheerfully cleaned up accidents, got lots of <br/>\nuse out of my bissell spot cleaner, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my children was comfortable using the potty and could stay clean <br/>\nlong before feeling comfortable going poop in the potty. We had <br/>\npull-ups, which we called &quot;park panties&quot; because the parks where we <br/>\nlived had no bathrooms (I also traveled with a potty in my van for a <br/>\nlong time) and because all my kids were day-time free long before they <br/>\nwere able to go through the whole night--nighttime for all of them <br/>\nhappened at around 4.5.  At any rate, my one child would simply go put <br/>\non a pull-up to go poop and call me when done for several months before <br/>\nusing the potty felt comfortable. For daytime, one was 19 mos for <br/>\neverything; one was about 2.5; one was about 2.5 for pee/ 3.5 for poop. <br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\nI just think each child is different, and boys, especially, tend to need <br/>\na bit more time, anecdotally. I would try not to stress about it or turn <br/>\nit into a big issue. Just be prepared and give him the space and help to <br/>\ngo through whatever process he needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (8), Julia (7), Sam (5)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;With our thoughts, we make the world.&quot; ~~Buddha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":218449772,"authorName":"zenmomma@comcast.net","from":"zenmomma@...","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] 4 yo potty stuff","postDate":"1138842887","msgId":9706,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMDIyMDA2MDExNC4xMDk4Ny40M0UxNUQwNzAwMDk4MEFGMDAwMDJBRUIyMjA3MDIyOTMzMEUwMzAzMDEwMzAyMEE5NkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":9705,"nextInTopic":9708,"prevInTime":9705,"nextInTime":9707,"topicId":9703,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
