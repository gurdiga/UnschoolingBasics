My girls are 4 and 2 and we do not <br/>\nco-sleep but the 4 yr old would sleep next to our bed whenever she <br/>\nneeded to. Now she &quot;sleeps&quot; on the couch since she also has <br/>\nallergies and needed to be proped up at night or she just coughs all <br/>\nnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is what the evening looks like. We go outside from about <br/>\n7:30 till almost 9:30 (we live in Utah and that is when it cools <br/>\noff) and I *suggest* baths since they are sweaty and sometimes <br/>\nsandy. Most the time they both take a shower and get into something <br/>\nto sleep in. We have a snack if they are hungry and I also *suggest* <br/>\nteeth brushing and going potty. Usually I will then offer to read <br/>\nbooks. If the little one is obviously tired I will ask her is she <br/>\nwants books or to lay down. If she wants books sometimes big sister <br/>\njoins us. If not I lay down with her in her bed till alseep. Big <br/>\nsister usually watches tv with daddy and will eventually say I am <br/>\ntired I need a rest and will lay down on the couch and fall alseep. <br/>\nThis all may not be acomplished until 11:30 at night. <br/>\n<br/>\nI realized early on that keeping them up till they were tired  and <br/>\nthen having them fall asleep quickly was better than fighting with <br/>\nthem till 10:oo anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo best advice is to start slow. Watch them to see when the act <br/>\ntired and then do bedish stuff and take it slow. I realized that <br/>\nchildren do not have to fall asleep in their beds and I remember a <br/>\nquote from I think Sandra Dodd that when asked when Kirby? when to <br/>\nbed they would say a half hour after he falls alsleep.

I would look into finding some<br/>\nAP parents to visit at the park occasionally. I would try to find some<br/>\nunschoolers to hang out with.

Why don&#39;t you have pull-ups for this<br/>\nchild? Or some form of protection so they don&#39;t have to wake up wet<br/>\nand uncomfortable?

It&#39;s not fun waking up wet.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the topic of being proactive...it&#39;s really hard to sometimes, but<br/>\nyou need to fill up your cup BEFORE you&#39;re down to the last bit of<br/>\nenergy/patience/joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThree young children is NOT an easy path at times. I have almost four<br/>\nyears between my children so I don&#39;t know exactly what it&#39;s<br/>\nlike....though I grew up with five siblings and babysat most of my<br/>\nlife even nannying as an adult while my own children came with me, so<br/>\nI have an idea!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo.....plan ahead. Some good waterplay, playdough, bath fun,<br/>\nwalks, bubbles and other fun things can get kids distracted in a rough<br/>\nmoment so you have time to recover your calm. I used to keep a sack of<br/>\nDollar Tree toys hidden way for rough moments. Anything new was enough<br/>\nto interest my children and buy me a bit of time to re-connect.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Transitioning","postDate":"1183775279","msgId":24883,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY2bXRuZitlbTQ4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY2a2RqOStsMTU3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24882,"nextInTopic":24885,"prevInTime":24882,"nextInTime":24884,"topicId":24835,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~So, are you suggesting or saying here that unless one can claim to be totally RUing that one should not reply, but rather leave the replying to those who","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1542117803\">~~So, are you suggesting or saying here that unless one can claim to<br/>\nbe totally RUing that one should not reply, but rather leave<br/>\nthe replying to those who have fully embraced and arrived at<br/>\n&quot;successful&quot; RU?~~<br/>\n<br/>\nNot at all.

Sure, I could trust they&#39;d learn anything at<br/>\nany time, we&#39;d been non-curriculum crazies from the beginning. Heck,<br/>\nI&#39;d been homeschooling as the lone Mum that didn&#39;t worry about<br/>\ncurriculum or workbooks or tests since 1996! I knew of no one that was<br/>\nas relaxed as us. <br/>\n<br/>\nEnter unschooling.com and a bunch of folks that thought kids COULD<br/>\nlearn to learn about anything and everything, even television.<br/>\nSoooo....it&#39;s hard to be questioned. But we either decide the<br/>\ninformation is valid or not and we incorporate it or ignore it.<br/>\n<br/>\nProblem for me? The information and questioning wouldn&#39;t leave me<br/>\nalone.

But I am honestly <br/>\nlooking for advice. I am at a loss about how to proceed in further <br/>\ntransitioning from unschooling to much more radical unschooling. I <br/>\nlove the stories I read here about supporting kids through all their <br/>\nexperimentation with mess, sleep and all their chosen projects, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a full on attachment mama to a 6 year old dd, a 3 year old dd <br/>\nand a 15 month old dd. Everybody nurses and cosleeps and there is a <br/>\nlot of night waking. 6 year old dd wets most nights so bedding and <br/>\npjs get changed. 3 year dd wakes to nurse a couple of times and now <br/>\nalso to use potty. 15 month dd nurses pretty much continually all <br/>\nnight. Dh works around the clock seven days a week for the last six <br/>\nmonths to earn our way with me staying home. We have no other family <br/>\nsupport as they live far away and/or deeply disapprove of our <br/>\nparenting methods. We live in the city and only know families with <br/>\nonly children who are quite alternative but still quite &#39;schooly&#39;. <br/>\nNone of them feel up to watching my bunch for even an hour to give me <br/>\na break. Without sleep all my good intentions go out the window and I <br/>\nstart imposing limits, it tends to be when I am at my limit. We live <br/>\nin a small three bedroom apartment (we only use two of the bedrooms <br/>\nas dh has all his mechanical/electronic/tools/etc. stuff for his f/x <br/>\nrobot building, camera motion business stored in bedroom #3) near <br/>\nbusy streets with no yard. Money is very tight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love life with my girls as it is but I want to give them more.<br/>\n<br/>\n  15 month old dd is into everything, as to be expected. She tries to <br/>\ndrink out of the toilet before 3 year old dd has had a chance to <br/>\nflush. She loves to feed herself everything spread everywhere and <br/>\nhates to be cleaned after, but gets eczema all over her face if I <br/>\ndon&#39;t clean her. She wants to climb everything. We have concrete <br/>\nfloors. It&#39;s a long way down from the kitchen counter. If I don&#39;t <br/>\nclean up all the food she messes around with she&#39;ll eat it the next <br/>\nday or week. How much of what she wants to do should I let her?<br/>\n<br/>\n3 year old dd loves to run wild and free. Near busy traffic or not. <br/>\nShe has little fear if any of danger to her person. She argues with 6 <br/>\nyear old dd a lot. They also play together fabulously much of the <br/>\ntime. Should I drop everything to help them through their arguments. <br/>\nShould I trust them to work it out? How much freedom of movement can <br/>\nsafely you give an exuberant three year old while also attending to <br/>\ntwo other children near busy traffic?<br/>\n<br/>\n6 year old dd has 20 new projects thought up before breakfast. I love <br/>\nthis, but how do i find time to help her work on them all. What do I <br/>\ndo when her sisters keep breaking her creations? What do I do when <br/>\nshe hits her sisters? How do I guide them all through their joys and <br/>\nsorrows and be attentive enough to each child&#39;s needs?  My girls have <br/>\na wonderful loving relationship full of empathy and fun. I am not <br/>\ntrying to paint them as having dysfunctional behaviour issues. They <br/>\nare very respectful and loving to one another. But they are all young <br/>\nand in close quarters. Working it out 90% of the time still means <br/>\nthey have trouble 10% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do others with loads of tiny children manage RU? I want to make <br/>\nmy life more difficult in order to gain a better relationship with my <br/>\nkids, but I start losing it at some undetermined point of difficulty. <br/>\nHow do I give them this? I have given them the gift of each other, <br/>\nwhich they love and cherish. How do I give them RU too? I know there <br/>\nis a way.

As time goes by we find ourselves constantly re-examining my Asian cultural values, my husband western values and our parenting values. Some we let go, some we keep. But nevertheless, I find ourselves letting go quite alot, as we and son progress naturally into unschooling. But still, I can&#39;t see us  100% radical unschooling because I do still keep a few control over my son&#39;s life.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  The ones we keep is exercising our parental rights to make him go to bed early, sometimes! If he&#39;s talking really, really loud and easily excited and bouncing of the walls at 9pm, and can&#39;t seems to hear the meaning of &quot;Stop&quot;, then it means he&#39;s out of control because his brain is too tired and is short-curcuiting. Well, that&#39;s how we&#39;ll explain to him, justifying the reason of an early bedtime at 9ish pm.  We co-sleep and bedtime presently seems to be getting later and later at 11.30ish which is fine with us. Hubby wakes at 6.30am and son wakes at 8.30ish. Where else I&#39;m more inclined to sleep till 10am, but am tryin very hard to drag myself out of bed at 9ish.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I don&#39;t tell son what to do as he seems to have his own routine, other than the outings I organise for us. He&#39;s not too fuss about it but there are times I still say we should go because mummy wants to go, so he&#39;s got no choice. He wakes, goes downstairs to watch tv or play PS2, until I wakes and give him breakfast. Goes back to PS2, and will change out of pjs and brush his teeth on his own sometime after that. And goes back to PS2 or pc. These goes on untl it&#39;s time to go out if we have an outing for that day or lunch time of which he is reminded to stop. He is not allowed back onto the PS2 in the afternoon.  So in the afternoon, he&#39;s normally on the internet for a short while, then we&#39;ll do something together like play a board game or crafts or watch tv together or go to the park nearby. Then it&#39;s time for me to prepare dinner of which son&#39;s back onto tv or pc educational games. Until dad&#39;s home, have dinner, watch news together, after which son plays with his toys or<br/>\n lego or train tracks or just rummaging thru his multiple toy boxes in his room upstairs, making a mess. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Bathtime is around 8pm. Back to more playing after that until bedtime. In bed, we&#39;ll read some books together, mostly me(of which dad gets to watch tv) or dad(my night of  Yippee!!) doing the reading, sometimes son will last 3 stories, sometimes he&#39;ll fall asleep halfway thru the first, of which the me or dad will fall asleep too. So I&#39;ll say the only time me and hubby get to really catch up is during dinner and weekend. <br/>\n     <br/>\n  If he&#39;s being unreasonable with me or dad, my 123 timeout tactic comes into play. We&#39;re ok with son having a totally different opinion from ours, that he&#39;s entitled to not wanting to do what we parents want to do, of which, if possible, we&#39;ll say &quot;ok, we won&#39;t go today, perhaps tomorrow?&quot; If he decides he fancies somethings else for dinner, that&#39;s fine too. But it&#39;s not fine if our son is being totally un-compromising, rude, and snappy at us parents. We&#39;re his parents, not his peers!! Even that of his peers, I would be very cross if he&#39;s being nasty to them. Of which he&#39;ll be send off for a time out to think and reconsider his position within this family hierachy.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Not very radical, I supposed but it works fine for us. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  SharonC <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

Every<br/>\nyear on the fourth we typically go to my parent&#39;s house on the<br/>\ncoast... this year I had one child at camp , one flying in on Monday<br/>\nafter a 12 day sailing trip in the keys who was exhausted etc.   So we<br/>\ndecided to stay here in Raleigh and just hang out and rest.   At the<br/>\ncoast each year my dad has someone come and do fireworks off the shore<br/>\nfor the kids and so forth, sparklers, the whole typical American 4th<br/>\nof July thing (you know hot dogs, apple pie and blowing stuff up! )  <br/>\n  Yesterday while dh and I were out shopping we picked up a variety<br/>\npack of fireworks (tame by grandfather&#39;s standard as he buys his in SC<br/>\nnot the &quot;safe&quot; ones they sell here in NC)  We got home and it was<br/>\n7:30pm and still bright and sunny outside so we explained to my son<br/>\nwho was SOOOO excited by the idea of getting to set off fireworks that<br/>\nwe needed to wait until dark to be able to see them better.   We had<br/>\ngotten these snake things that you light and they go from a pellet<br/>\ninto a long snake of ash (very weird looking but pretty cool!)  so we<br/>\ndid some of those to entertain him while it was still light out.   I<br/>\ncome back in to do a few things and eventually it&#39;s 9pm...he comes in<br/>\nand announces that its dark out and  we needed to do it now because it<br/>\nwas almost his bedtime.

Anyway I thought it was pretty clever of him to try to<br/>\ninfluence the timing of things with that little line!

Since Ray moved in things have <br/>\nbecome more challenging, though, and there have been times when I&#39;ve <br/>\nlaid on the couch and sort of dozed so I could run interferrence - <br/>\nRay&#39;s a night owl, but I totally don&#39;t expect him to &quot;look after&quot; <br/>\nMo. When my partner isn&#39;t wiped out from a day of sawing he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nneed nearly as much sleep as I do, so he&#39;s happy to stay up with Mo. <br/>\nPast two nights they&#39;ve gone and hung out by the mill so she could <br/>\nplay in the sawdust under the stars.

Morgan&#39;s sleep cycle <br/>\nperiodically shifts by a couple hours all-of-a-sudden. That always <br/>\nthrows me for a loop for a week while I figure out how to rearrange <br/>\nmy own time and energy to get my own &quot;stuff&quot; done. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe last two weeks I&#39;ve had a double whammy - Ray had gone to visit <br/>\nwith his mom and grandma and they made him go to bed &quot;at a <br/>\nreasonable hour&quot; - so when he came home his sleep schedule was <br/>\ntotally different then when he left. *And* Mo made one of her <br/>\nperiodic shifts and is now up much later than before.

Most nights we go to bed with our 4.8 yo son at around 11pm. He chose that time since babyhood, and it works for us because we are night owls. On an average night, we are all 3 doing things independent of one another, and having our son up and busy isn&#39;t a problem. However, some nights, I choose his bedtime. Sleepiness is often disguised as grumpiness or bouncing off the walls, and that&#39;s one of the cues I follow to know that he needs help finding rest. <br/>\n  And sometimes I just need a break, which I see as just as good a reason. In this case, I let him know that Mom needs quiet time, I ready him for bed, followed by story-time, a few &quot;Mom, I need a drink of water&quot;-type sitings, and he settles-in early. <br/>\n   I hope you and your family find what works for you. We really like our lives &#39;flying by the seat of our pants&#39;, but know that routines work well for a lot of people. Good luck and happy bedtimes!<br/>\n  Lisa O <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  With my kids, I pretty much say everything like it is. I don&#39;t have arbitrary rules, and I don&#39;t say &#39;because I told you so&#39;. I think that&#39;s why my son reasons things out so well, because I reason with him, and even tell him when I&#39;ve changed my mind about something, what I was thinking. I treat bedtime, TV time, mealtime, playtime, the same way. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still have to do the 123-threat to get him to take action (as I just did to get him to brush his teeth before bed), but even that is more of an understanding than a discipline. On 3, I usually chase him and tickle him, or playfully swat him on the tush. <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\nRobert Saxon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TheSaxons@...\">TheSaxons@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Hey out there, y&#39;all!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs some of you know, I&#39;ve got two daughters, ages 4 and 5 (16 months<br/>\napart).
