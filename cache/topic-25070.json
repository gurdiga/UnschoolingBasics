I think you have articulated what I&#39;m feeling about some of<br/>\nthe other parents involved - the sex aspect is being overemphasized<br/>\nand I think coloring the discussion a little too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely, my first concern is my daughter&#39;s safety and I think we&#39;re<br/>\ndoing a pretty good job there.  We&#39;ve never pushed the whole &quot;Don&#39;t<br/>\ntalk to strangers&quot; thing and she has grown up feeling free to trust<br/>\nher instincts in whatever situations come her way.  If there is<br/>\nsomething she doesn&#39;t quite feel equipped to deal with, she&#39;s not<br/>\nafraid to come and ask for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo clarify - in this situation, I don&#39;t think she is uncomfortable or<br/>\nunsafe at all.  Given my daughter&#39;s personality, I don&#39;t think she is<br/>\nbeing pressured into doing anything she doesn&#39;t want to and from my<br/>\nconversations with her, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything happening to<br/>\ncause concern.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy concern is how to explain the new playground rules to her.  After<br/>\nthe recent games of &quot;Truth or Dare&quot;, the consensus seems to be that a<br/>\nsexual element has been introduced to the children&#39;s play and that we<br/>\nshould do everything we can to stop it, including introducing some<br/>\npretty arbitrary playground rules - banning the game and telling the<br/>\nchildren that playing in the bushes (within earshot, but out of sight)<br/>\nis no longer allowed. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince my daughter thinks &quot;Truth or Dare&quot; is just a fun game wherein<br/>\nshe and her friends get to &quot;dare each other do wacky things&quot;, I am<br/>\nfinding it hard to explain why the game makes some of the adults feel<br/>\nuncomfortable.  The same with the bushes.  I believe my daughter when<br/>\nshe tells me she likes playing there for a specific set of reasons,<br/>\nnone of which have to do with sexual exploration.  It therefore seems<br/>\narbitrary to ban this. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe asks me outright, &quot;Why aren&#39;t we allowed to play in there?&quot;  and<br/>\n&quot;Why was it okay before, but not now?&quot;.  The answer to this question,<br/>\nin my mind is adult hysteria, but that&#39;s not the answer that&#39;s going<br/>\nto satisfy my seven year old and, out of respect for the other<br/>\nparents, I&#39;m not going to take that approach.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that articulates my concern a little better.<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nKirsten<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Jul 20, 2007, at 3:36 PM, Kirsten wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; For my question, I&#39;m hoping people could share any resources or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; personal stories about sex positive parenting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think you&#39;re overly focusing on  the sex aspect and that&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; confusing you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Focus on helping her be safe in any social situation.

Hopefully I can<br/>\ndo the same one day - right now, I think I&#39;m still muddling through it<br/>\nall and taking it a day at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is seven and while I&#39;ve always been philosophically drawn<br/>\ntowards unschooling, it&#39;s taken me some time to reassure that anxious<br/>\n&quot;schooled&quot; voice at the back of my head continually questioning the<br/>\nvalidity of what we&#39;re doing.  We recently moved to an area that has a<br/>\nsupportive IRL unschooling network and that, along with various<br/>\nboards, is helping tremendously.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my question, I&#39;m hoping people could share any resources or<br/>\npersonal stories about sex positive parenting.  We&#39;ve had some<br/>\nexperiences lately with playground play that has some<br/>\nparents a little on edge.  It appears to be of the &quot;I&#39;ll show you<br/>\nmine, you show me yours&quot; variety.  &quot;Truth or dare&quot; has also made an<br/>\nappearance - with what I consider pretty innocent dares - &quot;What color<br/>\nare your underpants?&quot;, &quot;Dance like a noodle&quot;, etc.  The response of<br/>\nsome of the parents involved seems a little alarmist and there is now<br/>\ntalk of &quot;No playing in the bushes&quot;, &quot;No truth or dare&quot;, etc.  While I<br/>\nwant to respect the wishes of these parents, I don&#39;t know how to do<br/>\nthis without communicating a &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; type of message to my<br/>\ndaughter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust from drawing on my own experience, I knew I wanted to raise my<br/>\ndaughter in a more open and honest atmosphere regarding sex.  Growing<br/>\nup, I never got even an abbreviated version of &quot;the sex talk&quot; and the<br/>\nresults were pretty disastrous.  I was definitely a late bloomer<br/>\n(pretty much terrified of the idea of even kissing someone) and not<br/>\nhaving had a model for a healthy sexual relationship, I found it<br/>\ndifficult to set boundaries or to know what I wanted in a<br/>\nrelationship.  It took a long time for me to take control of my own<br/>\nsexuality and I think I missed out on a lot of fun, and spent far too<br/>\nmuch time projecting the image of a victim.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, it&#39;s fairly natural for kids to have some curiosity<br/>\nabout each other.  I also think that for very young kids, once that<br/>\ncuriosity is satisfied, without the hormones to back it up, they are<br/>\ngoing to lose interest pretty quickly.  I think we have a fairly<br/>\nhealthy attitude towards sexuality at our house.  Nudity is common, we<br/>\nuse appropriate language to talk about our bodies, she knows where<br/>\nbabies come from.  After one game of &quot;Truth or Dare&quot; she said someone<br/>\nwas dared to kiss her.  I did have a little internal knee jerk &quot;Oh<br/>\nno!&quot; reaction, but to her I just sort of laughed and asked if the<br/>\nlittle boy had kissed her. She said, &quot;No, he didn&#39;t want to, so he had<br/>\nto take another dare,&quot; then she laughed and added, &quot;I&#39;m glad he didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to.  I don&#39;t want to kiss anyone!&quot;  We had a little discussion<br/>\nabout that in which I mentioned how much I look forward to a kiss from<br/>\nher dad when he gets home from work.  She rolled her eyes at this,<br/>\n&quot;Yeah, but you&#39;re grown-ups...and he&#39;s your husband.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my daughter, I&#39;ve been hesitant to bring up these new playground<br/>\nrules.  She says they like playing in the bushes because they make<br/>\ntrails and little club houses there.  She says sometimes she and her<br/>\nfriends want privacy to avoid having to negotiate with younger<br/>\nsiblings.  This corresponds with the type of play she has preferred at<br/>\nhome - making little houses out of natural materials, carving out<br/>\nlittle private spaces in which to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI admit to having asked her and her friend not to play in the bushes<br/>\none afternoon and basically, I just said that her friend&#39;s mom wasn&#39;t<br/>\ncomfortable with it, so while playing with her friend, we needed to<br/>\nrespect that.  That afternoon, the kids went into the<br/>\nbushes anyway, but without first telling me where they were going<br/>\n(they usually do) and they didn&#39;t come out until we had several<br/>\nanxious parents, myself included, calling their names repeatedly and<br/>\nbush-whacking up the hill to where we thought they might be.  She&#39;s<br/>\nonly seven, and so I do need to know where she is.  I&#39;m more worried<br/>\nabout not knowing where she is for an extended period of time than<br/>\nwhether or not she and her buddy are stealing kisses in the bushes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want her to get the idea that there is anything inherently<br/>\nshameful about what they are doing, if anything.  She&#39;s pretty<br/>\nheadstrong.  I doubt anyone could wheedle her into doing anything she<br/>\nwasn&#39;t comfortable with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have read Judith Levine&#39;s &quot;Harmful to Minors&quot; and while it is<br/>\nhelpful in a more academic type discussion about how the media and<br/>\nchanging cultural values fuel increased hysteria about the sexual<br/>\nabuse of children, it&#39;s not heavy on advice to the average parent<br/>\ntreading a delicate path.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading and I look forward to hearing the collective wisdom<br/>\nof the group on this,<br/>\nKirsten</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25060,"nextTopicId":25117}}
