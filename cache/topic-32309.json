Yuck! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d make sure the house is clean and that all the food is *very* <br/>\nkid-friendly (so you don&#39;t have to field concerns over their not <br/>\neating). Better would be to eat out somewhere where the kids would be <br/>\nhappy and easily pleased---*IF* they handle restaurants well. For us, <br/>\nPanera is very family-friendly---casual enough for the kids (and mine <br/>\nlike the food), yet &quot;fancy&quot; enough for the adults (at least it&#39;s not <br/>\nChuck E Cheese! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d try to stay out of the house as much as possible---like a trip to <br/>\nthe zoo or a museum the kids like. Something she would consider <br/>\n&quot;educational.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, I would be sure she knew you only have to &quot;school&quot; 180 days <br/>\nout of the year, so this is one of the 185 you DON&#39;T have to &quot;do <br/>\nschool.&quot; She&#39;s *visiting* after all! It&#39;s a *vacation&quot; day! &quot;School&quot; <br/>\ncan be &quot;put on hold&quot; while grandma&#39;s in town.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the kids can make a cute card or other crafty-something for her that <br/>\nwould be nice. Or make breakfast in bed for her with flowers from the <br/>\ngarden. Muffins and cut up fruit with coffee---or an omelette.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo they like to put on plays or puppet shows? Grands like that kind of <br/>\nthing---plus, it looks &quot;educational.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe set up a craft everyone can do together---grandma too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe busier everyone is, the better---for us, anyway. Less &quot;downtime&quot; <br/>\nfor serious discussions to begin. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhirlwind her in and out, and she won&#39;t have time to judge or complain. <br/>\n*That* can come after she&#39;s back in her own home. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":299286442,"authorName":"Cameron Parham","from":"Cameron Parham &lt;acsp2205@...&gt;","profile":"acsp2205","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Mother-in-Law visiting...","postDate":"1209668417","msgId":32311,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYxODQ1Ny42MzkzMy5xbUB3ZWI1OTIwMy5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":32310,"nextInTopic":32315,"prevInTime":32310,"nextInTime":32312,"topicId":32309,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am very nervous about my own parents upcoming visit, and am all too aware that if  they are determined to see the negatives that s what they will see. ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1003087898\">I am very nervous about my own parents&#39; upcoming visit, and am all too aware that if  they are determined to see the negatives that&#39;s what they will see.  Still, for a short visit maybe you could plan to avoid activities that worsen the conflict and try to identify one or more activities that all can enjoy with little conflict.
