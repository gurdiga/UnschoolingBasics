I am <br/>\na &#39;newbie&#39; to unschooling...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe decided to unschool only about 9 months ago.  Well, actually, *I* <br/>\ndecided (my husband is still skeptical) to unschool after a long line <br/>\nof difficult public school and hard-core curriculum based <br/>\nhomeschooling situations. I am moving in this process alot slower <br/>\nthan I wish to.  I have dealt with everything from trying to get a <br/>\ngrasp on what unschooling is, feeling the need to explain it to <br/>\nothers, dealing with ex-in-laws (the oldest is from first marriage) <br/>\nquestioning and grilling my oldest (10 yrs old) about why he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nknow what 12x12 or 9x9 is without writing it on paper (yet, they <br/>\ncould care less that he is running his own business and that he knows <br/>\nhow to sew), dealing with my own patience and ingrained feelings of <br/>\ndoubt and what is &#39;suppose&#39; to be happening right now....etc, etc, <br/>\netc.  The thought of just &#39;letting things flow naturally&#39; has been <br/>\nhard for me.  I always thought I was a laid back person... since we <br/>\nstarted unschooling, I realized how much of a control freak I have <br/>\nbeen.*sigh*   <br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to introduce myself and say how much I appreciate this <br/>\ngroup and all the helpful tips provided here.  I do understand the <br/>\npoint of not wallowing in pity and just moving on and figuring out <br/>\nhow to do better next time.  It&#39;s hard, but absolutely worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove and peace to all~ Amanda and gang</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34827,"nextTopicId":34966}}
