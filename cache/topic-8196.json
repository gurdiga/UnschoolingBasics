In this situation, 10 seconds  <br/>\nis nearly an eternity. The pupil, blink, and gaze-averting reflexes  <br/>\nstop significant exposures in less than 0.25 seconds. Even in the  <br/>\noffice of an eye surgeon, with a chin rest, a target, and a machine  <br/>\nto aim the beam steadily, it is difficult to keep a beam on a single  <br/>\nspot for more than a few tenths of a second. So, a laser pointer in  <br/>\nmischievous hands carries no real risk for immediate or delayed  <br/>\nretinal damage.<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] My bad...","postDate":"1134520432","msgId":8325,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJFNEYwQzY3LUU3QTItNDE1MS1COThFLTg1MkExMTYzRDVGOEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFjYjViYzcxY2I0MWRjLjFjYjQxZGMxY2I1YmM3QGRpcmVjd2F5LmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDFjYjViYzcxY2I0MWRjLjFjYjQxZGMxY2I1YmM3QGRpcmVjd2F5LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":8323,"nextInTopic":8326,"prevInTime":8324,"nextInTime":8326,"topicId":8196,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

People willingly put<br/>\nthemselves<br/>\nthrough painful experiences all the time.  Pain is natural - pain doesn&#39;t<br/>\nstop people from working out, having babies or performing acts of heroism in<br/>\ntimes of emergency.  FEAR of pain is what breaks people.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Thanksgiving my siblings and I (and our spouses) were recollecting some<br/>\nof the bad things that happened to us in our childhoods. There were some<br/>\nfunny stories and some not so funny ones. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that came to mind for me was the time I got the belt for<br/>\nbeating up a neighborhood girl.  I was ten years old and someone else<br/>\nactually beat her up to get back at her for saying she was going to tell all<br/>\nher friends to hate me.  The only thing I did was cry in school and this<br/>\nperson felt bad for me and beat her up for me although I never asked her to<br/>\ndo so.  The girl who got beaten up (not badly) was my childhood best friend.<br/>\n(it was on and off for many years) <br/>\n<br/>\nWord got back to my mother via my sister that I beat her up and I got the<br/>\nbelt.  Or did I?  I actually can&#39;t remember getting the belt.  I remember<br/>\nbeing told I was going to get the belt and I remember going to my room,<br/>\nwhere I was sent to wait for it.  I remember the fear I had waiting to get<br/>\nthe belt but I don&#39;t actually remember getting the belt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI still apparently harbor some resentment over this issue.  &lt;g&gt; I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember trying to verbally stand up for myself.  I remember knowing that I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be believed.  My mother came in the room during the end of the<br/>\nconversation and someone laughingly mentioned it to her and she just said,<br/>\n&quot;there is nothing I can do about it now.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love my mother and she was a good mother in many ways. If I could change<br/>\none thing about her I would change the fact that she has such a hard time<br/>\nsaying sorry.  Sorry would have helped even 28 years later.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had bad days as a parent and not parented as well as I would have<br/>\nliked.  I have always apologized for my bad behavior afterward.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I got off track but I was just trying to agree that the pain wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthe issue so much as the fear of the pain to come.  I was spanked.  Not for<br/>\nevery minor offense but for me it was definitely about fear.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say that it didn&#39;t actually work the way it was meant to because I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t behave any better, I just learned to be sneaky.  My mother mentioned<br/>\nat Thanksgiving that I had given her many of her gray hairs due to my<br/>\nbehavior as a teen.  (Getting drunk and puking out the window, for one) I<br/>\ngot drunk as a teen a lot (escaping life, I think) and I never called my<br/>\nmother to pick me up once. I wouldn&#39;t have ever dared to admit I was<br/>\ndrinking.  I drove my moped smashed to the hilt.  I rode with other drunk<br/>\nteens.  I thought it was cool that some kids could call their mothers and I<br/>\nknew that one day I would be one of those moms because I would never want my<br/>\nteen to be in the predicaments I got myself into without having some kind of<br/>\nsafe escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nGee, that was therapeutic.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":248194505,"authorName":"Rod Thomas","from":"&quot;Rod Thomas&quot; &lt;rodneykathy@...&gt;","profile":"flyerkat","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics]  laser light, was Pam S","postDate":"1134513626","msgId":8321,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNzQwMWM2MDAzNiQzODY2MjRkMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBTUEFNPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyMTMyMDA1MjEyOS4xNTEyMy40MzlGM0QzNTAwMDU1QUVGMDAwMDNCMTMyMjA1ODg5MTE2MEUwMzAzMDEwMzAyMEE5NkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":8319,"nextInTopic":8323,"prevInTime":8320,"nextInTime":8322,"topicId":8196,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"He is 12 and he knows the risks, we ve had the talk.

Paraphrasing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2008780488\">I hate to compare spankings to torture, but this is SO reminding me of an<br/>\nessay I read a long time ago about &quot;questionable&quot; questioning practices.<br/>\n<br/>\nParaphrasing what I remember:<br/>\n<br/>\nPain is not what breaks down the barriers.  People willingly put themselves<br/>\nthrough painful experiences all the time.  Pain is natural - pain doesn&#39;t<br/>\nstop people from working out, having babies or performing acts of heroism in<br/>\ntimes of emergency.  FEAR of pain is what breaks people.  As such the actual<br/>\npain is more a teaching tool than anything else.  For full effect, time is<br/>\nallotted before and after sessions for the prisoner to contemplate what will<br/>\nhappen as well as to fully appreciate what has happened.  As with any<br/>\nteaching moment, as many of the senses as possible should be involved.  what<br/>\nthe prisoner sees, hears and smells is just as important to the process as<br/>\nthe actual pain inflicted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess this compares to a lot of punishments.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the opposite side of the issue is current trends for training pets.  The<br/>\nanimal trainers I have spoken to or heard on tv talking about the issue are<br/>\npretty much in agreement about the best way to get the behaviors they want<br/>\nfrom the animals they are training.  Basically, positive reinforcement is<br/>\nwhat is currently in vogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, some people may object to the idea of &quot;training&quot; your kids like<br/>\nanimals (I know I do).  My guess is the unschooling way of raising civilized<br/>\nchildren is as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   1. Respect your children as people (because they are :) ).<br/>\n   2. Model the behavior you would like to see them emulate (this means<br/>\n   if YOU don&#39;t say &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; when you are dealing with people -<br/>\n   say at burger king getting a meal or having your groceries bagged - don&#39;t<br/>\n   expect them to).<br/>\n   3. Model REAL behaviors.  Fake politeness is obvious - even to<br/>\n   children.  If you wouldn&#39;t expect an adult to behave that way, why would you<br/>\n   expect it of your children.  You are raising them to be ADULTS, right?<br/>\n   4. Provide necessary resources - let them know what is expected ahead<br/>\n   of time.  Getting upset because they didn&#39;t behave in a way they didn&#39;t know<br/>\n   they were supposed to is just silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I could be wrong.  Usually, I just muddle through the issues as<br/>\nthey arise.  It seems to work so far.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 12/13/05, Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I can&#39;t speak for others, but for me it was because it hurt.

But it is part of the same continuum.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that it is a continuum.  I think there is great parenting, good parenting, ok parenting, poor parenting, bad parenting and abuse.  I think most of us move around on that continuum throughout each day, at least a little.  I know that sometimes I&#39;m a great parent but not all day, every day, even though I would like to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t think the behavior of the parent is necessarily the sole determining factor of where you are on the continuum.  I have seen parents swat a child because said child was harrassing another child and wouldn&#39;t stop it.  Parents swatted child A to protect child B.  Not great parenting but I can&#39;t call that abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally knew (when I worked as a therapist) a family who were illegally in this country and therefore scared to ask for help.  Their 8yo son was completely out of control, running the streets at night, taking off, physically attacking family members.  The parents tied him to a tree in an attempt to keep him at home, as safe as possible.  They didn&#39;t know what else to do but were trying to keep him from injuring himself or someone else.  Not great parenting but not abuse.  (He was later placed in a psychiatric hospital where he was restrained by physician order.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen parents swat a child because that child touched something the parent didn&#39;t want them to touch.  No discussion, no talking, just a swat.  I would consider that much closer to abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a family, personally, where the father never raised a hand to his children, never even raised his voice.  But with the slow, steady use of his &quot;loving and rational&quot; voice (much like Chinese water torture)has convinced all 8 of his children that he alone is capable of making decisions for the family.  He chooses their friends, activities, even their husbands.  The younger kids won&#39;t even eat food he doesn&#39;t like himself.  In my mind, he is quite abusive but has never spoke to his children in anything but a calm and &quot;loving&quot; manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you have to look at the entire context, what was going on, what was the parent&#39;s intent, had other methods at least been attempted, was someone else being hurt, etc..  I just don&#39;t think it is as simple as a swat equals abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Robyn Coburn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dezigna@...\">dezigna@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, December 12, 2005 8:41 am<br/>\nSubject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] My bad...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I do not think spanking is a good idea but I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; necessarilyclassify it as abuse.

But yeah, spanking is lower-level parenting and <br/>\n&gt; it will<br/>\n&gt; get in the way of unschooling. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This reminds of a discussion that my post grad Women in Film class <br/>\n&gt; (14 years<br/>\n&gt; ago) had talking about where abuse and sexism begins. The <br/>\n&gt; consensus was that<br/>\n&gt; it began very trivially with sexist jokes. Obviously it would be <br/>\n&gt; ridiculousto define a person who cracked sexist jokes as an abuser <br/>\n&gt; in comparison to a<br/>\n&gt; rapist or molester or wife beater, but still jokes are the <br/>\n&gt; beginning of a<br/>\n&gt; broader cultural acceptance of all but those most overt and <br/>\n&gt; serious examples<br/>\n&gt; of the abuse of women.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Until as a society we make the leap of choosing to define spanking <br/>\n&gt; as abuse,<br/>\n&gt; the relatively lesser end of it compared to the undeniable horrors <br/>\n&gt; thatJulie has seen, it will continue to be accepted. Maybe it is <br/>\n&gt; because she has<br/>\n&gt; seen horrors that swatting looks so minor in comparison. But it is <br/>\n&gt; part of<br/>\n&gt; the same continuum.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Again I refer people to Alice Miller&#39;s writing. She speaks of the<br/>\n&gt; anti-spanking laws enacted in Scandinavia, against an outcry of a <br/>\n&gt; vocalminority, and how these have apparently led to the reduction <br/>\n&gt; of all kinds of<br/>\n&gt; child abuse over the culturally brief span of only 20 years. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here are some more places for her writing, which continues to be <br/>\n&gt; reallycompelling (in a good way):<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.com/alice_miller/\">http://www.naturalchild.com/alice_miller/</a> (the Hitler reference <br/>\n&gt; includedhere)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nospank.net/milindex.htm\">http://www.nospank.net/milindex.htm</a> (many articles including <br/>\n&gt; something as<br/>\n&gt; recent as September 2005)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Robyn L.
