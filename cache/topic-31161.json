I was hoping someone on this board could help me:<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are a family of 5 with a SAHM. Apparently, 2 younger daughters <br/>\nhave no trouble with school, but they have a 12 year old boy <br/>\ndiagnosed with ADD (or ADHD?) and learning disabilities.

I have no idea where they are on the parenting <br/>\nspectrum, so it&#39;s hard, kwim? I have no idea how they&#39;d react to <br/>\ndeschooling, for example, and if they are capable of giving their son <br/>\nfreedom to do so...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, does anyone have some general resources on removing a kid <br/>\nlike this from school and helping him recover from this experience? <br/>\nSpecific books to recommend or websites.
