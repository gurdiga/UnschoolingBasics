My family consists of Justin age 5 1/2, Madison age  3, DH, <br/>\nand pets- dog, cats, chickens.  We live in an off-the-grid home in  rural New <br/>\nYork State.  <br/>\nMy son is attending private school this year (when I&#39;d been planning for  the <br/>\nlast 2 years to unschool) after my husband and I both found employment at  <br/>\nabout the same time.  We moved to the country a little over a year ago and  I <br/>\naccepted a teaching job (I teach high school special education- that&#39;s  another <br/>\nlong story, but is a big part of why we want to homeschool) because my  DH was <br/>\nunable to find work in this very rural area.  So shortly after I  went back <br/>\nto work (was SAHM for 4 years), DH accepts position.  So we  think, yippie, I <br/>\ncan go back to staying home and we can unschool... then, his  company anounces <br/>\nthat they will be closing within a few years but layoffs will  begin anytime <br/>\nnow.  So, it looks like I will continue working  afterall.  We decided to send <br/>\nour son to school for K since we were both  working this year.  Next year, if <br/>\nDH still has position, we would like him  to continue working as long as he <br/>\ncan to pay off the land that we purchased when  we moved here. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe will be able to live (barely) off my salary after that, but aren&#39;t  <br/>\nworried about that as prior to now, we&#39;d been living off one salary for years  <br/>\nanyway.<br/>\nOk, so that&#39;s my background info.  next year, I&#39;d like my son to not  go back <br/>\nto school.  My mom lives nearby and watches my 3 year old.   She says she <br/>\nwill watch my son too, but is very concerned about his  schooling.  I&#39;m talking <br/>\nto her about unschooling, but she doesn&#39;t quite get  it.  At this point, I&#39;m <br/>\nkind of now teling her that I can &quot;teach&quot; him in  the evenings, weekends, and <br/>\nsummers, and could she just watch him and play with  him during the day while <br/>\nwe&#39;re working?  Like she does with my daughter who  has a ball at grandma&#39;s with <br/>\nthe baking and the dress up , and the library  trips, you know.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son has been complaining this year already that he doesn&#39;thave enough  <br/>\ntime to play because he&#39;s in school, and why can&#39;t they have longer recess (at  <br/>\nleast his school actually has recess), etc.  He&#39;s excited about the stuff  he&#39;s <br/>\nbeen learning at school, but would prefer not to go.  We have a  housefull of <br/>\nfun stuff to do, books to read, woods to play in, animals to care  for, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if anyone else has homeschooled with 2 parents working?  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy son would love it home with grandma as her place has tons of stuff to  do. <br/>\n He told me last night that if he didn&#39;t have to go to school he could  sew <br/>\nwith grandma (she makes quilts and great costumes), do airplane models with  <br/>\ngrandpa, play legos, and sleep in!  Plus paint, draw, write, and listen to  <br/>\ngrandma read books.<br/>\n <br/>\nI guess that even though I had been plainning on homeschooling all along,  we <br/>\ngot off track this year with working and sending him to K. It&#39;s not that I&#39;ve <br/>\n lost the courage to keep him home next year, I had just always thought I&#39;d <br/>\nbe  the one home with him having all the unschooling fun!<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, where we live there is not a homeschooling group.  There are a  few <br/>\nvery rigid Christian school at homers, and about 1 1/2 away is a more  relaxed <br/>\ngroup, but a long drive for a playdate.<br/>\n <br/>\nANY THOUGHTS?  <br/>\nThanks so much,<br/>\nAMANDA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9588,"nextTopicId":9535}}
