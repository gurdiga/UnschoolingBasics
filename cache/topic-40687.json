It talks about how making things equal is not always possible or advisable and how to help each child realize they are loved for their unique qualities, how sometimes one child needs more of one thing than another but everyone&#39;s needs will be met. I found it very helpful to really get into each of their shoes and see how I would react to some of the &quot;standard&quot; answers we are taught to give. Hope it helps. <br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nSharon Bliss</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40699,"nextTopicId":40708}}
