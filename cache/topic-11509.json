As you begin to truly LIVE,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll wonder at those that stay trapped within the box of school and<br/>\nnever choose to fly free.<br/>\n<br/>\n******<br/>\nRen,<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to say that even though I have been unschooling for a <br/>\nlong time I found this whole post just inspiring and well, <br/>\nbeautiful.  This paragraph especially describes what finding <br/>\nunschooling did for me.  Years ago when I was thinking that a good <br/>\nhome school mommy recreated school at home, I was growing so <br/>\nfrustrated and upset because I felt that by being their &#39;teacher&#39;, I <br/>\nwas missing out on just being their mom.  I wanted to be their mom, <br/>\nand unschooling brought all that back.  The difference in the <br/>\natmosphere of our home when we started unschooling was so big you <br/>\ncould &#39;feel it in the air&#39;.  It made everyone happier, and the joy <br/>\nspilled over to others outside our home.  It has been several years <br/>\nsince we started unschooling but I stay on the &#39;basics&#39; list because <br/>\nit helps me to remember...to remember what it was like before... and <br/>\nto be ever so thankful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11502,"nextTopicId":11503}}
