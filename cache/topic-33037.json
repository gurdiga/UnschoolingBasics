My mouth literally dropped open when he told me, because you just wouldn&#39;t know it.  And he got my surprise and said that many people don&#39;t realize it because he compensates - he understands the way social situations work enough that even though he has to consciously *think* about social behaviour, he can do that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSlightly off topic, sorry, BUT, my ex, OTOH, would never see or admit that he loses things, is highly reactive to the girls, is highly compulsive, has a low sex drive, and so on - because he is unaware of these traits in himself, he doesn&#39;t get that he pushes people away from him with his behaviours - and although i *understand* where those behavious come from and was able to honour him for who he was for a long time, once we had children, it just didn&#39;t work anymore - he was totally unable to see that his uncontolled fits of anger and frustration were harmful to the girls - and even though we had many talks about it, he *never* in 23 years changed any of his behaviours -<br/>\n<br/>\n so I am not a saint!  Sometimes I feel a bit guilty that I could no longer live with him, but also it helps if there is a little bit of a two-way street - but he is actually happier now that we no longer live with him -- he is free to just do his own things and can tune into the girls on occaision - he just couldn&#39;t handle the daily demands of having children, and I couldn&#39;t handle the daily demands of not having a partner - but this seems to work out fine once we all got over our resentments, and I think he now a good relationship with the girls that they can all live with.  And he does things with the girls that I don&#39;t do, like taking them on long trips to England or BC or wherever - that does make up for a lot!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you are blessed to be surrounded by loved ones and that you guys have such a good give and take!  I do sometimes wish that I could have figured a way to be more tolerant of him, to have more of a sense of humour around it or whatever, but I just didn&#39;t have it in me...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Ren Allen <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, May 31, 2008 9:37 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: What the Unschooling Gurus teach is so true!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~<br/>\n  As a child, I was away with the fairies.

It put words to <br/>\nmy experience of aspects of my parents&#39; way of relating to me as a <br/>\nchild. Even though in many ways, my childhood was traumatic (not my <br/>\nparents),unusual and my parents related in many dysfunctional ways, <br/>\nthere was always a sense that if the chips were down, they would be <br/>\nthere for me. They did and still do, think I&#39;m pretty alright and I <br/>\nknow (cos I&#39;ve snuck up on these conversations) that they boast about <br/>\nme and my latest doings to anyone who will listen. How I reacted to <br/>\nmy childhood in ways of self-preservation and a stubborn self-<br/>\nreliance is another story &lt;g&gt;. But you have pinpointed that there can <br/>\nbe a very strong sense in a child that regardless of all sorts of <br/>\nother things, they do sense when their parent is doing their best and <br/>\nreally loves them. Of course, now I am a parent, I have pretty high <br/>\nstandards for myself and I am not excusing intentional neglect of <br/>\none&#39;s parenting duty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a child, I was away with the fairies. I was always losing things, <br/>\nnot listening, etc. - actually as an adult too - but my parents just <br/>\nsaw that as part of me. They got frustrated with me, lectured me <br/>\nabout it and so on, but they would equally help me to find stuff or <br/>\nhelp me replace lost things. In the present, my kids see me &#39;lose it&#39; <br/>\nover the same stuff - usually practical stuff when I am off in the <br/>\nclouds - and they accept me in it, help me without judging and offer <br/>\nthe ultimate soother - a cup of tea. Then we carry on. The same thing <br/>\nhappens when they are having a hairy moment. It can all end in tears, <br/>\nbut we all know it&#39;s reedeemable and we can try again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a high school student, I gravitated towards at least one very <br/>\norganised person in my year - the one who always had the timetable, <br/>\ncolour-coded, knew how to read it and the school map, wore a watch <br/>\nand had a diary with all the assignment due dates in it. Some would <br/>\nsay that this was because my parents hadn&#39;t taught me how to be <br/>\norganised or responsible. The fact is, I was working part-time before <br/>\nI was ten, owned and cared for my own horse from the age of twelve, <br/>\nperformed well academically, blah blah. I just didn&#39;t do school <br/>\ntimetables. I helped lots of students with schoolwork, was a loyal <br/>\nfriend and knew what field I wanted to work in after school. I had <br/>\ngood compensatory mechanisms in place to help MYSELF be more <br/>\norganised and I have spent my life admiring and learning from people <br/>\nmore orgainsed than me. I really didn&#39;t like school as a system and <br/>\nalthough I often handed in work and sat exams in high school, I <br/>\navoided being there and spent a lot of time doing what I saw as &#39;real <br/>\nthings&#39;. My parents DID despair of me for a while on this count. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, my family and friends think that I am pretty responsible <br/>\n(well, they trust me an awful lot with their kids and other stuff if <br/>\nnot, lol) and good to be with. they also seem to think it&#39;s okay that <br/>\nI often run a bit late, forget the same details they have told me <br/>\nover and over and often require emergency feeding and cups of tea. I <br/>\nam constructive and efficient in my many hours of volunteer work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I got out of school,I got many good tertiary qualifications and <br/>\nworked in lots of different jobs, despite being refused a copy of my <br/>\nYear 10 Certificate (despite many top of the form marks) due to <br/>\ntruancy. My teachers didn&#39;t hold out much hope of me sticking at <br/>\nanything by the time I left &lt;g&gt; If I wasn&#39;t at home with the most <br/>\nimportant people in my life, I could return to a well-paid job in <br/>\ncounselling, herbal medicine, animal husbandry, etc. in pretty short <br/>\norder.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t died of boredom reading my CV, my point is - I have <br/>\ntaken a very unorthodox route to maturity, but though the journey was <br/>\nmy own, I haven&#39;t become a dysfunctional adult, simply because I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t MADE to conform. I have LEARNT myself what is worth standing <br/>\nfor and because I have arrived there myself, I know what my <br/>\nconvictions mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thank you again, Jeanette, for helping me to tap into this little <br/>\nrealisation of mine, by sharing your experiences,<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m so glad you wrote this.

But I always knew <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that there was something different about my parents.  When I look <br/>\nback on what they did so right (and continue to do) is to think that <br/>\nwe are the best people ever.  In fact, my mom says that to me to this <br/>\nday- &quot;your kids need to know that they are the most wonderful people <br/>\nin the world!&quot;  She never said this to me, but she made me feel this <br/>\nway.  My mom actually sees most everyone this way.  She doesn&#39;t look <br/>\nat people and see flaws and shortcomings.  She didn&#39;t look at my <br/>\nmessy bedroom and think:  she&#39;ll never learn to keep her room <br/>\nclean.   In fact, when I was in college, one of my 5 jobs was <br/>\ncleaning houses and I was awesome at it!  My parents had such <br/>\nconfidence in us.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another thing that stands out is that my parents didn&#39;t do things <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the way they were &quot;supposed&quot; to be done.  They weren&#39;t hung up on <br/>\nthe &quot;right&quot; way to raise kids.  We rarely ate family dinners <br/>\ntogether, but we all hung out together on their bed at least once <br/>\neach day.  My mom was all about connection.  She said that the most <br/>\ndifficult thing about us going to school was that she had to try so <br/>\nhard to reconnect with us every day, but she made it a PRIORITY.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know this sounds strange, but another thing my parents did was <br/>\n </span></blockquote>help me make &quot;excuses&quot; for my mistakes.  This was HUGE for me and my <br/>\nsiblings.  We never saw our faults, mistakes, shortcomings, etc. as <br/>\nbeing permanent.  If there was an &quot;excuse&quot; then that meant that I <br/>\ncould change it-if I wanted to, or I could accept something about <br/>\nmyself as being unique.  Grades, honors classes, perfect behavior, <br/>\nmanners, responsibility, chores, curfews, etc- were not issues in our <br/>\nfamily.  No one pushed these things.  Relationships, fun, excitement, <br/>\nlaughing, kindness, friendships, community, teamwork, and love were <br/>\nall valued.  The funny thing was that even though my parents didn&#39;t <br/>\npush grades we were all decent to good students.  Even though they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t push good behavior-none of us ever got in trouble in school or <br/>\nout of school.  Even though my parents didn&#39;t push <br/>\nchores/manners/responsibility most everyone would tell you that I was <br/>\nthe most responsible, mature kid<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  they ever met!  I used to get up on Saturday mornings at 6:00, get <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the newspaper, cut out coupons, make a grocery list, and then my dad <br/>\nwould take me shopping.  This was ALL my idea and I was in 4-6th <br/>\ngrade when I did this.  In high school I would come home from <br/>\npractice at 6:30 and go to bed, then I&#39;d get up at 4:00 am to do my <br/>\nhomework and go running.  My mom would occasionally get up to read <br/>\nliterature assignments to me because I just never &quot;got it&quot; when I <br/>\nread it to myself and my dad would get up to run with me.  My brother <br/>\nand sister were responsible in their own ways too.  (And we were <br/>\nall &quot;irresponsible&quot; in our own ways-which was accepted too.)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The final thing that stands out is that my parents were  &quot;in the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>back seat&quot; or &quot;on the sidelines&quot; a lot.  They let us do the driving <br/>\nin our lives.  They didn&#39;t &quot;worry&quot; about us, they didn&#39;t hover, they <br/>\njust stepped in when we needed them.  They could be &quot;bossy&quot; when I <br/>\nneeded that, they could be supportive when I needed that, they could <br/>\njust listen when I needed that, they could tell when they were needed <br/>\nand when they weren&#39;t, they could tell how they were needed too.  In <br/>\nfact, my mom even encouraged me to skip school for a day if that was <br/>\nwhat she thought might help me : )<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; That was a lot of writing to say that my parents were accepting, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they stayed connected, they were confident in us as individuals, <br/>\ntheir lives were not run by rules but rather by relationships.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Sometimes when I read this list,  I feel like if I don&#39;t do <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*everything*<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; right, my kids will grow up without a good relationship with me.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I don&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; let them have total control over their food, bedtimes, chores, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>things they<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; learn, whether or not they go someplace with us, how much tv and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>computer<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they watch, etc.  then they won&#39;t ever learn how to be passionate, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>motivated<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; life-long learners.

Forget those labels <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(food, bedtime, praise, punishment, etc.) and just focus on your <br/>\nrelationship with your kids.  If you focus on the relationship then <br/>\nthe mistakes that you make won&#39;t matter as much and you will learn <br/>\nfrom your mistakes.  It will mean having confidence in your kids and <br/>\ntheir ability to show you your place.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; You need to see your kids as already being great people, and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>trusting that they will always be great people.  Make &quot;excuses&quot; for <br/>\nthem and then help them change or accept those &quot;excuses&quot; as they <br/>\nwish.  For example, my nickname was eight o&#39;clock when I was little <br/>\nbecause no matter where I was, I fell asleep before 8, even if it was <br/>\nin a room full of people.  I would be IRATE if anyone disturbed me.  <br/>\nThis was just accepted and set me apart as being special or unique.  <br/>\nMy brother on the other hand stayed up late and could not get up for <br/>\nschool in the morning EVER!  It was just accepted and no one tried to <br/>\nfix him or solve his problem.  BTW he still goes to bed late and has <br/>\nmanaged to be VERY successful in his career.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have also learned to make &quot;excuses&quot; for our parents.  For <br/>\n </span></blockquote>example, when my mom can&#39;t find something she freaks out!  She knows <br/>\nit, we know it and we all have just accepted that about her.  She <br/>\nalways apologizes and says, &quot;I just get so frustrated when I know I <br/>\njust had it,&quot; or whatever.  My dad always freaked out about shoes <br/>\nbeing by the front door.  My best friend still remembers that about <br/>\nmy dad.  Anyhow, we all have our quirks, but in our family it has <br/>\nhelped our relationships to be accepting of those quirks, and talking <br/>\nthings out when it effects us too much.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The bottom line is that if something is effecting your relationship <br/>\n </span></blockquote>negatively then step back and figure out what will help the <br/>\nrelationship.  Some people see their kids as things to fix or improve <br/>\nor change.  I think that my parents saw me as a unique person that <br/>\nthey wanted to validate, encourage, trust, understand, enjoy (even <br/>\nthe quirks), and appreciate.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Jeanette<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":278087315,"authorName":"elendil722003","from":"&quot;elendil722003&quot; &lt;chis31@...&gt;","profile":"elendil722003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: What the Unschooling Gurus teach is so true!","postDate":"1212221121","msgId":33277,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcxcjBzMStrNGhlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGcxYTV1dCs0amJzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33160,"nextInTopic":33280,"prevInTime":33276,"nextInTime":33278,"topicId":33037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

These days, I continue to be pretty relaxed about how they <br/>\nkeep things in their rooms, being that they have their own room each <br/>\nand I figure it is good practice of having their own place and also <br/>\nbeing able to have their own space now. ( I have struggled more when <br/>\nthey have shared a room at times, as one has had a different need for <br/>\norder at a different time to the other, lol).<br/>\n<br/>\nI find they are willing to help tidy the shared lving areas (I am <br/>\nreally okay with them saying no and I really love what Rosenberg says <br/>\nin NVC parenting that children will often be willing to help if they <br/>\nknow they are truly free to say no and that it is a request for help, <br/>\nnot a demand).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I am doing any tidying of general living areas myself, I <br/>\ncarefully place any of their personal items in a corner of their <br/>\nroom, letting them know I have done so and taking extra care with <br/>\nfragile things not to put it somewhere that they might not notice it <br/>\nand step on it, etc. Sometimes they offer to take it themselves if <br/>\nthey see me gathering things up. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf either of us gets overwhelmed with the level of mess in their <br/>\nbedroom, we will usually make some time ( I schedule big blocks of <br/>\ntime, so we can include dealing with feelings of frustration or extra <br/>\nsorting of clothes, plus just being able to enjoy the time together <br/>\nchatting). I don&#39;t even bother to &#39;go there&#39; in the middle of a busy <br/>\ntime when we are in and out, or busy on other projects (including <br/>\nR&R) at home. I figure that the last thing any of us need after a <br/>\nbusy few days is to have yelling or stress about those &#39;filthy kids <br/>\nrooms&#39;. I mean, if I haven&#39;t had time to get around to things in the <br/>\nhouse, then they probably haven&#39;t either and I wouldn&#39;t like it if <br/>\nthe first quiet moment I got, my dh came and yelled about my <br/>\ndreadfully messy room, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, I told dd that I was planning an early morning attack on <br/>\nher room and she was welcome to join in, but that it was really <br/>\nbugging me. She said she would be happy to help, but I would have <br/>\nbeen okay to go it alone, because I felt quite motivated to do it and <br/>\nI wanted the satisfaction of seeing things in order in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight, dd has a lovely clean room, which she helped with, I have a <br/>\nmassive pile of dirty laundry &lt;g&gt; and we had a lovely time sorting <br/>\nclothes that she was finished with and how great she felt to be <br/>\npassing them on to a good friend who is younger than her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was even inspired to clean the parent&#39;s bedroom!<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt tremendously free to act on a task I was motivated to do, dd <br/>\ndidn&#39;t feel blamed about having a messy room, or coerced into <br/>\ncleaning it. Ds has requested a similar cleaning angel to visit and <br/>\nis happy to help also.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been times that they have both been quite happy to dwell <br/>\nin a very untidy room where they can&#39;t find a thing and we have been <br/>\nquite okay. Sometimes they have refused help from me and cleaned <br/>\nthemselves. The time has always come around when the room gets tidy <br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have higher standards for the shared living areas and this is <br/>\nusually the focus of day to day tidying. Sometimes I get utterly <br/>\noverwhelmed. Sometimes I am a cleaning demon. But I am always working <br/>\non our relationships and I really believe that this is the most <br/>\nimportant thing. I think there can be a fear that if we &#39;let things <br/>\ngo&#39;, that chaos will reign, or that our children will suffer as <br/>\nadults, unless they have been taught to get the &#39;boring stuff/tasks <br/>\nout of the way first and then do the fun stuff&#39;. I am hoping not to <br/>\ntransmit such a dichotomy between work and play. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that flexibility is so important in living with other human <br/>\nbeings.

Admittedly, I do get tired towards 9 pm, but<br/>\nI cannot leave a 3 and 5 year old awake with no supervision.&quot;<br/>\nHi Maisha, <br/>\nIt seems I have kids of similar ages to yours...and as I thought about it, I realized that it&#39;s been my husband and I that have changed our nightime &quot;routine&quot; to fit that of the kids....I&#39;m not sure if any of this might be helpful to you, but, it might help to reframe what it could look like.  <br/>\nDH here gets tired around 8:30 or 9 and usually makes a general announcement that he&#39;s going to bed soon.  DS 9 LOVES to read and snuggle with Dad, as does DD4 so he&#39;ll head up with the two of them (if DD4 is not already asleep after going all day without a nap...sometimes she hits the hay at about 7:30).  DD2 and I are at this point usually snuggling and she&#39;s nursing in her room. After I get DD2 down and the other three are asleep, I join DD11 downstairs.  She&#39;s usually at the computer or reading or waiting for me to watch a special program with her.  This is &quot;her&quot; time with me.  We usually spend an hour or so talking or watching or cleaning up until she is ready to sleep.  Then I usually stay up a bit later on the computer or just having a cup of tea.  <br/>\nWhat&#39;s changed for us since unschooling....&quot;my attitude&quot;!  I used to feel like I was hurrying up to get them to bed so &quot;I&quot; could do something!!  Now, I realize that usually that something is something we could have done together.  <br/>\nAlso, DH gets up at about 5....has his own time and a few cups of joe to himself.  He also has some time to read the sports or NY Times on the computer.  Believe it or not, our couple time has gotten better....I usually wake him up when I come into bed.  I&#39;m less stressed because I haven&#39;t been hurrying everybody into doing what I want them to do, so the mood is usually generally better  ;)  So, LATE night is our alone time together.  I&#39;m naturally a night owl, so staying up late suits me and give me some much needed time with my oldest DD, and then I usually get woken up in the morning anyway by DD2 (my natural alarm clock!)  <br/>\nI have to admit, we&#39;re still working on the &quot;connecting and conversation&quot; part od DH and my relationship.  There&#39;s usually little time for us (excpet for when we&#39;re in the car together, which I highly recommend),.....but we&#39;ve found ourselves of late e-mailing each other quite a bit.  ...sort of takes me back to the days of our dating and writing letters back and forth.  ;)<br/>\nI hope some of this might help give you some ideas....<br/>\nBest of luck!<br/>\nPeace, <br/>\nBeth in MA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: bedtime revisited","postDate":"1211817852","msgId":33156,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjQwMWM4YmY0YSQyM2RlMzc3MCQwMzAxYThjMEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4="},"prevInTopic":33151,"nextInTopic":33160,"prevInTime":33155,"nextInTime":33157,"topicId":33037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***This is still an issue for us here.

As they get older they&#39;ll be better able to be up by themselves, or come get you if they want something, and you&#39;ll all adjust.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Dylan was little and wanted to be up later I&#39;d go to bed with dh for awhile and then get up again.   I&#39;d doze on the sofa while Dylan played or watched TV but I was right there if he wanted me.   Maybe you could go to bed for a while and then get up again when your dh falls asleep and then Rohana could have her time while you were with kids.  Would you have the stamina for that? &lt;g&gt; Would your little ones let you doze a bit? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not perfect but if you can get more physical exercise during the day (and I realize how insane that must sound to you when you spend every day with a big family of busy kids&lt;g&gt;) it will help you have more energy.  Can you squeeze in fifteen minutes of yoga or stretching or go jog around the block before your kids get up?   Over time it will help.   Also, if you&#39;re depressed you&#39;ll feel tired more and want to sleep more and if that&#39;s a possibility the exercise can help with some emotional stuff too. <br/>\n<br/>\n***And then, dh wants the option of watching TV or using the computer in the<br/>\nevenings - sometimes watching programs that really aren&#39;t the best for the<br/>\nkids to see (too scary, too sexual, etc).***<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you delight the kids away from the TV into another room for a game or story?  (I so wish I could take credit for that term &quot;delight them away&quot; but I can&#39;t. I don&#39;t remember now who first used it but it&#39;s wonderful.)   We just got a TV from the Goodwill for thirteen dollars after ours sputtered out and it works perfectly...(it is not stylish, it&#39;s huge and weighs five hundred pounds)  could you get another TV so dh could watch his programs in your room?  Would he be willing to forego the adult themed stuff for a couple years if the kids are sensitive to it now?     Do you know it would bother the kids or does it just feel wrong to you to have it on with them around?  Could you talk up how much fun it would be to watch something silly with the kids, instead? <br/>\n<br/>\n***Not to mention, again, my need to stop<br/>\ngetting water, food, or any other request and needing to recharge my<br/>\nbatteries.***<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you make a tray of food, some little sandwich squares, grapes, crackers, a favorite thing or two,  with some little Dixie cups of juice and water and put it where the kids can get it?   Even if it gave you fifteen minutes to stand under a hot shower it might help to revive you.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** How can we come up with some solution that<br/>\nwill honor everyone&#39;s needs?***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you look at it objectively, when you think about your bedtime routine with your littlest kids do your kids seem unhappy or are they ok with it?  If things are going smoothly for now let it be.  Your kids are always growing and changing and learning and in a year or two these things will be changed too.<br/>\n<br/>\n I could afford, physically and emotionally, because I had one child, and because I don&#39;t need much sleep, to put my needs last or to put some of them away for another day in order to better give my growing and changing kid what he needed.  I had good conditions for it, though.   My dh didn&#39;t complain (much&lt;g&gt;)  I didn&#39;t have to work outside the home and I had only one child.    <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa Gray","from":"Melissa Gray &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] bedtime revisited","postDate":"1211813212","msgId":33151,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDQjhEQjNFLUUzNDYtNERGNi04NTVDLTk3M0VGREIwN0IyMkBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxYzMwMWM4YmYzYSQ3ODU1ZGFjMCQ2OTAxOTA0MCRAbmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwODMwMWM4YmU3YyQ2NDQ0OWVlMCQwMzAxYThjMEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4gPDAxYzMwMWM4YmYzYSQ3ODU1ZGFjMCQ2OTAxOTA0MCRAbmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":33146,"nextInTopic":33156,"prevInTime":33150,"nextInTime":33152,"topicId":33037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maisha, I know about wanting adult time, it is hard, especially in large families, because it seems like you re doing the little child parenting for such a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1450746543\">Maisha,<br/>\nI know about wanting adult time, it is hard, especially in large  <br/>\nfamilies, because it seems like you&#39;re doing the little child  <br/>\nparenting for such a long time. Most families, in ten years, have  <br/>\nmore independent children, and yet, we&#39;ve had little ones for over  <br/>\nthirteen years and probably have eight more to go before I can just  <br/>\nsay &quot;Going to bed, see ya tomorrow&quot;.  I have all these fun things I  <br/>\nwant to do that they don&#39;t see the value of, sewing, crochet,  <br/>\nreading, writing, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve done several things to help our family with this. One is moving  <br/>\nslowly...like adding five minutes of time that I spend on my thing  <br/>\nbefore I come back and spend an hour with the kids. We also have  <br/>\nplanned a night that is our &#39;date night&#39; so that the kids have agreed  <br/>\nthat mom and dad would like to watch a movie that might not be a good  <br/>\nchoice for them, and they have a party in their rooms. My oldest has  <br/>\nnominally agreed to be in charge on that one night, so that we can  <br/>\njust sit and snuggle. It doesn&#39;t mean that they DON&#39;T come in, but it  <br/>\nis much reduced...and because it&#39;s only one night they are excited to  <br/>\nhelp us have our romantic night ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d make sure to cook something for the younger kids if they are  <br/>\nprone to try to cook without, and that way they have their yummy  <br/>\nsnack, and try to set up a shelf in the fridge that is just for them.  <br/>\nDuring the day practice some things that they could make alone and  <br/>\nthey can put some on &#39;their shelf&#39; . Get small water bottles that can  <br/>\nbe refilled with whatever and put them on that shelf as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I&#39;m even being helpful, but I spent all weekend with  <br/>\na bunch of huge families, and so I&#39;m feeling especially blessed right  <br/>\nnow to have only the seven around me.<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Joshua, Breanna, Emily, Rachel, Samuel, Daniel and Avari<br/>\nWife to Zane<br/>\n<br/>\nblog me at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://startlinglives.blogspot.com/\">http://startlinglives.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://startlinglives365.blogspot.com\">http://startlinglives365.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On May 26, 2008, at 9:12 AM, Maisha Khalfani wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &lt;You brought up an example of bed times.

Most people (but <br/>\nnot all) find something inherently pleasant in a &quot;clean&quot; space - its <br/>\neasy to find things, its restful on the eyes, it has a different <br/>\naesthetic than &quot;messy&quot;. So providing a clean space for family <br/>\nmembers is a gift to them, something they value for the way they <br/>\nfeel when a room is clean vs messy. That&#39;s not something that people <br/>\nstop appreciating unless cleaning itself becomes tied to some other <br/>\nemotional glop - guilt, martydom, shame, that sort of thing. Hard to <br/>\nappreciate someone who keeps saying &quot;You better appreciate this <br/>\ndarnit!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the marvelous things about living joyfully with our families <br/>\nis that all our joy and graciousness and kindness fills up the needs <br/>\nfor those in our family members. When those needs are &quot;full&quot; then <br/>\nthe people we love go on spreading the same joy and grace and <br/>\nkindness - they give it back to us. Why shouldn&#39;t they? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo our kids will eventually want to give us gifts of love - the <br/>\ncatch is that what they see as loving won&#39;t necessarily be a clean <br/>\nliving room today. It may be a muddy flower today, a plate of <br/>\npancakes tomorrow (and a trashed kitchen), clean folded laundry the <br/>\nnext, and an offer to take us out for icecream after that. Will the <br/>\nliving room ever be cleaned by either of my kids? No idea. But I do <br/>\nsee them expressing kindness, being thoughtful and gracious, giving <br/>\ngifts of love to me and each other regularly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i want my children to be able to feel the pride and joy that comes <br/>\n&gt; from being able to tackle a big task like a messy room...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What about a big task like getting past the next &quot;boss&quot; monster in <br/>\ntheir favorite video game? Or a big task like creating an entire <br/>\ncard game - cards, rules, sequence of play, the whole schebang - and <br/>\nteaching it to another person? Or a big task like saving Ten Whole <br/>\nDollars to buy a hamster? Those are some recent things my 6yo has <br/>\nbeen able to feel pride and joy in, things she chose to do for <br/>\nherself. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;if it means simply modeling it now, then great...i just <br/>\n&gt; want to make sure i&#39;m not also setting them up to just expect <br/>\n </span></blockquote>others <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to do for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rather than thinking in terms of modelling cleanliness, think about <br/>\nmodelling appreciation itself. Do you applaud when you kid gets past <br/>\nthat monster? Do you admire the workmanship of those handmade cards? <br/>\nAre you impressed as hell when the 6yo manages to not spend every <br/>\npenny every trip to the store so she can eventually buy that <br/>\nhamster? How many moms and wives feel underappreciated but never <br/>\nshow appreciation for the efforts of other family members? I know a <br/>\nfew irl.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; how do you still help them learn good <br/>\n&gt; life skills like how to keep a clean room (which will equate to a <br/>\n&gt; clean house in adulthood). is modeling alone enough?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, they&#39;ll still need help, information, advice and appreciation, <br/>\ntoo. What they don&#39;t need are lessons on &quot;how to be the kind of <br/>\ngrownup mom and dad want you to be&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that, though, its really not so helpful to think about every <br/>\nthing your kids do as preparation for some later, more complete <br/>\nlife - adult life. They need help and support and information and <br/>\nappreciation and love right now, because people need those things. <br/>\nEven kid-people. Yes, there are &quot;results&quot; of being kind to your <br/>\nkids, but parenting with an eye toward those results distracts you <br/>\nfrom the reality that is your children Right Now. Today my 6yo has <br/>\ninvented a card game and my 14yo is at a friend&#39;s house killing <br/>\nmonsters. Hooray!

i have a HUGE problem with <br/>\nthis between my 2.5yr old and my 7.5yr old and i really am at a loss <br/>\nas to how to deal with it. my gut reaction is to get mad at my older <br/>\nfor overreacting and lashing out and my younger for doing all he can <br/>\nto rile up the older. yet, i know this doesn&#39;t work and only makes <br/>\nthings worse. there&#39;s no reasoning with either of them. the younger <br/>\nis too young to understand and the older completely closes her ears <br/>\nthe second you start trying to talk to her about an issue. so i know <br/>\ni need a new approach.<br/>\n<br/>\njeanette, i like how you talk about making &quot;excuses&quot; for them... <br/>\nthat&#39;s an intriguing thought...because i think i&#39;ve always been led <br/>\nto believe that excuses like that lead to a continuation of bad <br/>\nbehavior and worse. i&#39;m intrigued as to how this can work with my <br/>\nchildren. i think i sometimes sorta do this anyway, but perhaps not <br/>\nin the spirit you are talking about. its more a way to aleviate <br/>\nstress for me. but it is very true that my daughter simply is a very <br/>\nsensitive child, as i was, and simply has no tolerance for what she <br/>\nviews as irritating behavior by others...particularly her <br/>\nbrother...but is there a way to accept this without condoning her <br/>\nlashing out so nastily at her little brother? i&#39;m not sure exactly <br/>\nhow to make this work in a positive way. she just gets so nasty with <br/>\nhim and i worry that as he grows up being lashed out at that it will <br/>\naffect his relationship with her and possibly even his self esteem, <br/>\nsince he simply adores his older sister. <br/>\n<br/>\nplus the more she lashes out at him, the more he learns to push her <br/>\nbuttons and is now getting to an age (he&#39;ll be 3 in july) that he <br/>\ndeliberately does things like throw things at her and hits her just <br/>\nto get that crazy reaction from her. he likes the reactions he gets <br/>\nto things. he tends to do what we tell him NOT to do...so we <br/>\nactually, when we&#39;re thinking clearly and not reacting on emotions, <br/>\nhave made a &quot;don&#39;t do...&quot; game where we tell him to not do exactly <br/>\nwhat we want him to do and amazingly he most of the time will do <br/>\nexactly that! with a smile on his face. bizarre. LOL. doesn&#39;t always <br/>\nwork though and often in the heat of the moment its difficult to play <br/>\nthis game when we are fired up on the angry reactions we have to his <br/>\ndumping a cup of water or food on the floor for the 3rd time today <br/>\nand hitting his sister repeatedly with a toy because he likes how she <br/>\nscreams and cries when he does it. *sigh*  i&#39;m really at whit&#39;s end <br/>\nwith how to get a reconnection with them and and to help them <br/>\nreconnect with each other!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ntina<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jeanette Crichton <br/>\n&lt;jeanettec_99@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Right, I wasn&#39;t unschooled, I went to school.

When I look <br/>\nback on what they did so right (and continue to do) is to think that <br/>\nwe are the best people ever.  In fact, my mom says that to me to this <br/>\nday- &quot;your kids need to know that they are the most wonderful people <br/>\nin the world!&quot;  She never said this to me, but she made me feel this <br/>\nway.  My mom actually sees most everyone this way.  She doesn&#39;t look <br/>\nat people and see flaws and shortcomings.  She didn&#39;t look at my <br/>\nmessy bedroom and think:  she&#39;ll never learn to keep her room <br/>\nclean.   In fact, when I was in college, one of my 5 jobs was <br/>\ncleaning houses and I was awesome at it!  My parents had such <br/>\nconfidence in us.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another thing that stands out is that my parents didn&#39;t do things <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the way they were &quot;supposed&quot; to be done.  They weren&#39;t hung up on <br/>\nthe &quot;right&quot; way to raise kids.  We rarely ate family dinners <br/>\ntogether, but we all hung out together on their bed at least once <br/>\neach day.  My mom was all about connection.  She said that the most <br/>\ndifficult thing about us going to school was that she had to try so <br/>\nhard to reconnect with us every day, but she made it a PRIORITY.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know this sounds strange, but another thing my parents did was <br/>\n </span></blockquote>help me make &quot;excuses&quot; for my mistakes.  This was HUGE for me and my <br/>\nsiblings.  We never saw our faults, mistakes, shortcomings, etc. as <br/>\nbeing permanent.  If there was an &quot;excuse&quot; then that meant that I <br/>\ncould change it-if I wanted to, or I could accept something about <br/>\nmyself as being unique.  Grades, honors classes, perfect behavior, <br/>\nmanners, responsibility, chores, curfews, etc- were not issues in our <br/>\nfamily.  No one pushed these things.  Relationships, fun, excitement, <br/>\nlaughing, kindness, friendships, community, teamwork, and love were <br/>\nall valued.  The funny thing was that even though my parents didn&#39;t <br/>\npush grades we were all decent to good students.  Even though they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t push good behavior-none of us ever got in trouble in school or <br/>\nout of school.  Even though my parents didn&#39;t push <br/>\nchores/manners/responsibility most everyone would tell you that I was <br/>\nthe most responsible, mature kid<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  they ever met!  I used to get up on Saturday mornings at 6:00, get <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the newspaper, cut out coupons, make a grocery list, and then my dad <br/>\nwould take me shopping.  This was ALL my idea and I was in 4-6th <br/>\ngrade when I did this.  In high school I would come home from <br/>\npractice at 6:30 and go to bed, then I&#39;d get up at 4:00 am to do my <br/>\nhomework and go running.  My mom would occasionally get up to read <br/>\nliterature assignments to me because I just never &quot;got it&quot; when I <br/>\nread it to myself and my dad would get up to run with me.  My brother <br/>\nand sister were responsible in their own ways too.  (And we were <br/>\nall &quot;irresponsible&quot; in our own ways-which was accepted too.)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The final thing that stands out is that my parents were  &quot;in the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>back seat&quot; or &quot;on the sidelines&quot; a lot.  They let us do the driving <br/>\nin our lives.  They didn&#39;t &quot;worry&quot; about us, they didn&#39;t hover, they <br/>\njust stepped in when we needed them.  They could be &quot;bossy&quot; when I <br/>\nneeded that, they could be supportive when I needed that, they could <br/>\njust listen when I needed that, they could tell when they were needed <br/>\nand when they weren&#39;t, they could tell how they were needed too.  In <br/>\nfact, my mom even encouraged me to skip school for a day if that was <br/>\nwhat she thought might help me : )<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; That was a lot of writing to say that my parents were accepting, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they stayed connected, they were confident in us as individuals, <br/>\ntheir lives were not run by rules but rather by relationships.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Sometimes when I read this list,  I feel like if I don&#39;t do <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*everything*<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; right, my kids will grow up without a good relationship with me.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I don&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; let them have total control over their food, bedtimes, chores, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>things they<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; learn, whether or not they go someplace with us, how much tv and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>computer<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they watch, etc.  then they won&#39;t ever learn how to be passionate, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>motivated<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; life-long learners.

Forget those labels <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(food, bedtime, praise, punishment, etc.) and just focus on your <br/>\nrelationship with your kids.  If you focus on the relationship then <br/>\nthe mistakes that you make won&#39;t matter as much and you will learn <br/>\nfrom your mistakes.  It will mean having confidence in your kids and <br/>\ntheir ability to show you your place.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; You need to see your kids as already being great people, and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>trusting that they will always be great people.  Make &quot;excuses&quot; for <br/>\nthem and then help them change or accept those &quot;excuses&quot; as they <br/>\nwish.  For example, my nickname was eight o&#39;clock when I was little <br/>\nbecause no matter where I was, I fell asleep before 8, even if it was <br/>\nin a room full of people.  I would be IRATE if anyone disturbed me.  <br/>\nThis was just accepted and set me apart as being special or unique.  <br/>\nMy brother on the other hand stayed up late and could not get up for <br/>\nschool in the morning EVER!  It was just accepted and no one tried to <br/>\nfix him or solve his problem.  BTW he still goes to bed late and has <br/>\nmanaged to be VERY successful in his career.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have also learned to make &quot;excuses&quot; for our parents.  For <br/>\n </span></blockquote>example, when my mom can&#39;t find something she freaks out!  She knows <br/>\nit, we know it and we all have just accepted that about her.  She <br/>\nalways apologizes and says, &quot;I just get so frustrated when I know I <br/>\njust had it,&quot; or whatever.  My dad always freaked out about shoes <br/>\nbeing by the front door.  My best friend still remembers that about <br/>\nmy dad.  Anyhow, we all have our quirks, but in our family it has <br/>\nhelped our relationships to be accepting of those quirks, and talking <br/>\nthings out when it effects us too much.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The bottom line is that if something is effecting your relationship <br/>\n </span></blockquote>negatively then step back and figure out what will help the <br/>\nrelationship.  Some people see their kids as things to fix or improve <br/>\nor change.  I think that my parents saw me as a unique person that <br/>\nthey wanted to validate, encourage, trust, understand, enjoy (even <br/>\nthe quirks), and appreciate.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Jeanette<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: What the Unschooling Gurus teach is so true!","postDate":"1211729484","msgId":33094,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODMwMWM4YmU3YyQ2NDQ0OWVlMCQwMzAxYThjMEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4="},"prevInTopic":33088,"nextInTopic":33104,"prevInTime":33093,"nextInTime":33095,"topicId":33037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Sometimes when I read this list, I feel like if I don t do *everything* right, my kids will grow up without a good relationship with me. *** Your","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2017449399\">***Sometimes when I read this list, I feel like if I don&#39;t do *everything*<br/>\nright, my kids will grow up without a good relationship with me. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYour relationship with your kids doesn&#39;t depend on this list. &lt;g&gt;  It depends on whether you make your relationship with them more important than anything else. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou brought up an example of bed times.

I once<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; remember reading about a mother whose daughter&#39;s room gets really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; junky...so junky that the child is too overwhelmed to clean it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mother said that she cleans her daughter&#39;s room and that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; daugther<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would come to her and thank her for a clean room.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I found that fascinating because at the time I was still under the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impression that children clean their rooms. I have friends who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their children...young children such as 4, 5, and 6 clean their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rooms<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by themselves.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But because I really believed in unschooling and did not want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mandate my children cleaning their rooms, I decided to clean their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; room for them when it gets too messy. My children are 4 and 7 years<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; old respectively. My 7 year old son truly is one who leaves<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his &quot;stuff&quot; lying around the house. We have had many discussion on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; why he does this when we can&#39;t find what he is looking for. I tell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him that clutter disturbs me. He tells me that he likes his room<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; messy....so on and so on....<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; WELL, the other day I went into his room while he was sleeping and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cleaned it. When he awoke, he had a neat and clean room where he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could find whatever he needed. He walked into my room and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; said, &quot;Thank you for cleaning my room Mama.&quot; I about fell out! I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; immediately thought about the mother I described earlier and this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; group as a whole.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; His gratitude for the clean room warms my heart more than my making<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him clean his room. And what I find is that my modeling cleaning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; home is what makes my children do the same at times. It makes me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feel good and we have way more harmony and peace as a result.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So I write this as a thank you to all whose knowledge and wisdom in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the unschooling thang has helped me.

The mother needed to feel needed and  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want her daughter to show signs that she didn&#39;t need her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think too often we see adults and near adults with the behavior of  <br/>\nmuch younger children -- not cleaning up, living in their parents&#39;  <br/>\nbasement, temper tantrums when they don&#39;t get their way -- and we  <br/>\nassume that childlike behavior is the natural state of humans. We  <br/>\nassume that we aren&#39;t all self-centered and dependent and wanting to  <br/>\nonly play while we eat candy is because parents trained those traits  <br/>\nout of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut humans naturally want to do for themselves. They want to feel  <br/>\ncompetent. Even children do. But we can interfere with that by  <br/>\npushing. We interfere with that by preventing them.

Probably the biggest difference,  <br/>\nthough, is that while it&#39;s hard for other adults to crush our  <br/>\nspirits, we can do it to kids.

It really struck a chord with my latest<br/>\n<br/>\nunschooling struggle.  It wasn&#39;t the fact that you were &quot;unschooled&quot; that<br/>\nallowed you to have a close relationship with your parents.  What was it?<br/>\nTheir attitude?  Their respect for you?  How they weren&#39;t judgmental and you<br/>\ncould feel like you could talk to them about anything?   The way they<br/>\ncommunicated with you?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nRight, I wasn&#39;t unschooled, I went to school.  But I always knew that there was something different about my parents.  When I look back on what they did so right (and continue to do) is to think that we are the best people ever.  In fact, my mom says that to me to this day- &quot;your kids need to know that they are the most wonderful people in the world!&quot;  She never said this to me, but she made me feel this way.  My mom actually sees most everyone this way.  She doesn&#39;t look at people and see flaws and shortcomings.  She didn&#39;t look at my messy bedroom and think:  she&#39;ll never learn to keep her room clean.   In fact, when I was in college, one of my 5 jobs was cleaning houses and I was awesome at it!  My parents had such confidence in us.<br/>\nAnother thing that stands out is that my parents didn&#39;t do things the way they were &quot;supposed&quot; to be done.  They weren&#39;t hung up on the &quot;right&quot; way to raise kids.  We rarely ate family dinners together, but we all hung out together on their bed at least once each day.  My mom was all about connection.  She said that the most difficult thing about us going to school was that she had to try so hard to reconnect with us every day, but she made it a PRIORITY.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this sounds strange, but another thing my parents did was help me make &quot;excuses&quot; for my mistakes.  This was HUGE for me and my siblings.  We never saw our faults, mistakes, shortcomings, etc. as being permanent.  If there was an &quot;excuse&quot; then that meant that I could change it-if I wanted to, or I could accept something about myself as being unique.  Grades, honors classes, perfect behavior, manners, responsibility, chores, curfews, etc- were not issues in our family.  No one pushed these things.  Relationships, fun, excitement, laughing, kindness, friendships, community, teamwork, and love were all valued.  The funny thing was that even though my parents didn&#39;t push grades we were all decent to good students.  Even though they didn&#39;t push good behavior-none of us ever got in trouble in school or out of school.  Even though my parents didn&#39;t push chores/manners/responsibility most everyone would tell you that I was the most responsible, mature kid<br/>\n they ever met!  I used to get up on Saturday mornings at 6:00, get the newspaper, cut out coupons, make a grocery list, and then my dad would take me shopping.  This was ALL my idea and I was in 4-6th grade when I did this.  In high school I would come home from practice at 6:30 and go to bed, then I&#39;d get up at 4:00 am to do my homework and go running.  My mom would occasionally get up to read literature assignments to me because I just never &quot;got it&quot; when I read it to myself and my dad would get up to run with me.  My brother and sister were responsible in their own ways too.  (And we were all &quot;irresponsible&quot; in our own ways-which was accepted too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe final thing that stands out is that my parents were  &quot;in the back seat&quot; or &quot;on the sidelines&quot; a lot.  They let us do the driving in our lives.  They didn&#39;t &quot;worry&quot; about us, they didn&#39;t hover, they just stepped in when we needed them.  They could be &quot;bossy&quot; when I needed that, they could be supportive when I needed that, they could just listen when I needed that, they could tell when they were needed and when they weren&#39;t, they could tell how they were needed too.  In fact, my mom even encouraged me to skip school for a day if that was what she thought might help me : )<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a lot of writing to say that my parents were accepting, they stayed connected, they were confident in us as individuals, their lives were not run by rules but rather by relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Sometimes when I read this list,  I feel like if I don&#39;t do *everything*<br/>\nright, my kids will grow up without a good relationship with me.  If I don&#39;t<br/>\nlet them have total control over their food, bedtimes, chores, things they<br/>\nlearn, whether or not they go someplace with us, how much tv and computer<br/>\nthey watch, etc.  then they won&#39;t ever learn how to be passionate, motivated<br/>\nlife-long learners.  If I ever gave them praise or punishment, they wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nturn out to be great people.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nMaybe you&#39;re trying to look at too many things. Forget those labels (food, bedtime, praise, punishment, etc.) and just focus on your relationship with your kids.  If you focus on the relationship then the mistakes that you make won&#39;t matter as much and you will learn from your mistakes.  It will mean having confidence in your kids and their ability to show you your place.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to see your kids as already being great people, and trusting that they will always be great people.  Make &quot;excuses&quot; for them and then help them change or accept those &quot;excuses&quot; as they wish.  For example, my nickname was eight o&#39;clock when I was little because no matter where I was, I fell asleep before 8, even if it was in a room full of people.  I would be IRATE if anyone disturbed me.  This was just accepted and set me apart as being special or unique.  My brother on the other hand stayed up late and could not get up for school in the morning EVER!  It was just accepted and no one tried to fix him or solve his problem.  BTW he still goes to bed late and has managed to be VERY successful in his career.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have also learned to make &quot;excuses&quot; for our parents.  For example, when my mom can&#39;t find something she freaks out!  She knows it, we know it and we all have just accepted that about her.  She always apologizes and says, &quot;I just get so frustrated when I know I just had it,&quot; or whatever.  My dad always freaked out about shoes being by the front door.  My best friend still remembers that about my dad.  Anyhow, we all have our quirks, but in our family it has helped our relationships to be accepting of those quirks, and talking things out when it effects us too much.<br/>\nThe bottom line is that if something is effecting your relationship negatively then step back and figure out what will help the relationship.  Some people see their kids as things to fix or improve or change.  I think that my parents saw me as a unique person that they wanted to validate, encourage, trust, understand, enjoy (even the quirks), and appreciate.<br/>\nJeanette<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: What the Unschooling Gurus teach is so true!","postDate":"1211680458","msgId":33078,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgxMzYxLjc1MDIzLnFtQHdlYjgxNTAxLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGcxYTV1dCs0amJzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33077,"nextInTopic":33080,"prevInTime":33077,"nextInTime":33079,"topicId":33037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh and my 5 year old has cleaned up his room all by himself one day when i was super stressed out and it was amazing.I did not find out until late at nigh when","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-153476098\">Oh and my 5 year old has cleaned up his room all by himself one day when i was super stressed out and it was amazing.I did not find out until late at nigh when I walked in it.<br/>\n  He said he wanted to helped me.<br/>\n  Today he and his 28 month old sister where almost fighting to help me make a cake.<br/>\n  <br/>\n                           <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n   <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: What the Unschooling Gurus teach is so true!","postDate":"1211680266","msgId":33077,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI1NjE3NC44MzI1MS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGcxYTV1dCs0amJzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33075,"nextInTopic":33078,"prevInTime":33076,"nextInTime":33078,"topicId":33037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"it is something i frequently have on my mind because i had a college roommate who s mother cleaned her room for her and did probably everything for her growing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1720149783\">it is something i frequently have on my mind because i had a college <br/>\nroommate who&#39;s mother cleaned her room for her and did probably <br/>\neverything for her growing up and she was the WORST roommate...she <br/>\nabsolutely refused to help with the cleaning. she was the biggest <br/>\nslob i&#39;ve ever met. and very lazy.

It really struck a chord with my latest<br/>\nunschooling struggle.  It wasn&#39;t the fact that you were &quot;unschooled&quot; that<br/>\nallowed you to have a close relationship with your parents.  What was it?<br/>\nTheir attitude?  Their respect for you?  How they weren&#39;t judgmental and you<br/>\ncould feel like you could talk to them about anything?   The way they<br/>\ncommunicated with you?<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when I read this list,  I feel like if I don&#39;t do *everything*<br/>\nright, my kids will grow up without a good relationship with me.  If I don&#39;t<br/>\nlet them have total control over their food, bedtimes, chores, things they<br/>\nlearn, whether or not they go someplace with us, how much tv and computer<br/>\nthey watch, etc.  then they won&#39;t ever learn how to be passionate, motivated<br/>\nlife-long learners.  If I ever gave them praise or punishment, they wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nturn out to be great people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m realizing that this is my perfectionism creeping up on me again.  It not<br/>\nreally about following these rules, it&#39;s about being thoughtful about what<br/>\nyou are doing.  If, for whatever reason, DH and I decide that bedtimes are<br/>\nneeded in our home (which they are NOT, by the way!), it doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>\nwe are not unschoolers.  It doesn&#39;t mean that our children will not have<br/>\ngood relationships with us or have sleep issues or hate learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I was going about unschooling all wrong.  I think I was trying to<br/>\nreplace my old rules with new ones.  But that&#39;s really missing the point.  I<br/>\nthink we talk about things like bedtimes, food control, learning to read,<br/>\netc. because a lot of parents deal with these things without being very<br/>\nthoughtful about them.  (Why do we *have to* put kids to bed at 8:00 every<br/>\nnight, if they don&#39;t have to get up for anything or if they are not tired?)<br/>\nBut that doesn&#39;t mean I have to follow the a &quot;no bedtime&quot; rule, if it works<br/>\nfor our family.  Following all the &quot;rules&quot; of unschooling, isn&#39;t what makes<br/>\ngreat kids.

I <br/>\nimmediately thought about the mother I described earlier and this <br/>\ngroup as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis gratitude for the clean room warms my heart more than my making <br/>\nhim clean his room.  And what I find is that my modeling cleaning my <br/>\nhome is what makes my children do the same at times.  It makes me <br/>\nfeel good and we have way more harmony and peace as a result.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I write this as a thank you to all whose knowledge and wisdom in <br/>\nthe unschooling thang has helped me.  I write to tell the newbies <br/>\nthat the sooner you just go with what is being said to you in this <br/>\ngroup, the sooner you will be one who says, &quot;Yeah, Radical <br/>\nUnschooling really works.&quot; and you will truly mean it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove to you all<br/>\nTyra in Tennessee</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33350,"nextTopicId":21700}}
