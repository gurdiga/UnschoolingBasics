Did you  <br/>\nchange or quit your job? do you get help? what about your partner?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are willing to give me quotable answers, please write to me to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dialog@...\">dialog@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPlease not that I will NOT change your quotes (maybe I&#39;ll have to  <br/>\nshorten them, then I&#39;ll ask for your permission). I&#39;m fully supportive  <br/>\nof unschooling and promise not to twist any answers as to depict  <br/>\nunschooling as &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; or anything. The magazine &quot;unerzogen&quot;  <br/>\nis about unschooling, democratic education and respectful parenting.  <br/>\nWe have printed articles/interviews from: Joyce Fetteroll, Kelly  <br/>\nLovejoy and Sandra Dodd.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your support! Unschooling (homeschooling even) is illegal  <br/>\nin Germany. Please help us contribute to inform people about  <br/>\nunschooling ideas by sending me answers that I can use :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case my questions are not clear, here are possible answers, so you  <br/>\ncan see what I&#39;m looking for:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I quit my job and my husband works. We&#39;ve cut back and live in a  <br/>\nsmaller flat so we can finance unschooling&quot;.<br/>\n&quot;We both work and do this in different shifts so that most of the time  <br/>\nsomeone is at home with the kids&quot;<br/>\n&quot;We have a problem and have not come up with a solution yet, but we&#39;re  <br/>\nworking on it&quot;<br/>\n&quot;We have an network of unschooling friends and try to help each other  <br/>\nout&quot;<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I&#39;m not looking for people who fit my answers -- these were  <br/>\nrather jus examples. I&#39;m looking for real solutions that you&#39;ve come  <br/>\nup with. Or maybe even different ways to approach this &quot;problem&quot; (like  <br/>\nnot seeing it as a problem?..) The answers should not be too long, so  <br/>\nI can quote many different unschoolers on one page.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings from Germany<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGefl√ºstert wird nicht! - UNERZOGEN<br/>\nwww.unerzogen-magazin.de<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38382,"nextTopicId":38271}}
