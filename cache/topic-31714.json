No matter where I <br/>\nsent them, I was dissapointed, as were they.<br/>\nSo, I started looking into homeschooling last year (when everyone was <br/>\ntelling me I needed to get my daughter into a pre-pre-school) and  came <br/>\nacross unschooling.  It just makes so much sense!   Although I know it <br/>\nwill be hard for me, to always wrap my head around the concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I wanted to say thanks for all the info I have gleaned from you <br/>\nguys so far!   Now I know where to go when I am stuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great day!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31713,"nextTopicId":31715}}
