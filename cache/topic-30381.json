I don&#39;t think <br/>\nyou&#39;re seeing the forest thru the trees. Putting the obviously biased <br/>\nopinion article aside (it was obviously speaking to a certain <br/>\naudience and looking for a cetain reaction), what the court case is <br/>\nstating is disturbing, because it is NOT addressing the abuse <br/>\nallegations so much as the homeschool rights. Now it&#39;s posible that <br/>\nthe abuse allegations are being treated as a seperate case, IDK. But <br/>\nwhat is in this case is dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the original worry here was that California would suddenly <br/>\n&gt;become a place where parents couldn&#39;t homeschool their kids.   The <br/>\n&gt;court document said that there were several exemptions from the <br/>\n&gt;California law of compulsory attendance and this family had not <br/>\n&gt;sufficiently met any of those exemptions.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But they did meet those exemptions. They were using a licensed <br/>\numbrella school, which hundreds of others do as well. One of the <br/>\nother options was to establish your own private school in your home, <br/>\nbut from the sounds of the court case, this was an unacceptable form <br/>\nas well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;That there are hundreds (or thousands? I don&#39;t know) of families <br/>\n&gt;homeschooling in California suggests that many families successfully <br/>\n&gt;exempt their children and this parent could have too.   It seems a <br/>\n&gt;case where a person put his own religious or political agenda before <br/>\n&gt;the welfare of his children.  It&#39;s possible that no matter what kind <br/>\n&gt;of a nut he wanted to be he could have successfully exempted his kid <br/>\n&gt;and he didn&#39;t.   Abuse, if he was abusive, is not a homeschooling <br/>\n&gt;issue.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Precisely! It is *not* a homeschooling issue. It&#39;s an abuse issue. <br/>\nAnd they never stated that they were requiring school because of the <br/>\nabuse or until they clear up the allegations or whatever. They were <br/>\nturning an abuse case into a homeschooling issue, thereby **setting a <br/>\nprecedent for future cases** (just as how this case used prior court <br/>\ncases as a precedent to argue their point that HSing is not lawful).  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what happens if it comes out that this son and father simply had <br/>\nan argument and the son called CPS with allegations that were not <br/>\ntrue? If the abuse is overturned, the kids don&#39;t go back to <br/>\nhomeschooling because the court didn&#39;t state they had to go to school <br/>\nbecause of abuse, but ***because of qualifications to homeschool***. <br/>\nThe court has turned allegations of abuse into a legal right to <br/>\nhomeschool or not homeschool. THAT&#39;S the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe very fist line of the document states: In this dependency case <br/>\n(Welf. & Inst. Code, § 300), we consider the question whether parents <br/>\ncan legally &quot;home school&quot; their children. [Not whether these parents <br/>\nbut whether parents in general.]<br/>\n<br/>\nSubsequent lines state: &quot;However, California courts have held that <br/>\nunder provisions in the Education Code, parents ****do not have a <br/>\nconstitutional right to homeschool their chilredn***.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis document also states that the parents were <br/>\nproviding &quot;lousy,&quot; &quot;meager,&quot; and &quot;bad,&quot; education, and that keeping <br/>\nthe children at home &quot;deprived them of situations where (1) they<br/>\ncould interact with people outside the family, (2) there are people <br/>\nwho could provide help if something is amiss in the children&#39;s lives, <br/>\nand (3) they could develop emotionally in a broader world than the <br/>\nparents&#39; &quot;cloistered&quot; setting.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many judges could state the same about unschoolers, calling our <br/>\neducation &quot;lousy, meager or bad&quot;? We know it&#39;s not true but to an <br/>\noutside opinion (like that of my BILs) that is what they see. So the <br/>\nquestion is not whether their education is lousy but who&#39;s right is <br/>\nit to state so? Isn&#39;t it your right to maintain your childrens <br/>\neduction and to state whether they are learning? What if the court <br/>\ncame into to your life and stated what you were doing didn&#39;t <br/>\nconstitute &quot;Education&quot; as they saw it and demanded your child/ren go <br/>\nto public school?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe document also clearly states they believe the rights of the state <br/>\nare above the rights of the parents by stating <br/>\n- &quot;primary purpose of the educational system is to train school <br/>\nchildren in good citizenship, patriotism and loyalty to the state and <br/>\nthe nation as a means of **protecting the public welfare**&quot; <br/>\n- &quot;that nothing be taught which is manifestly inimical to the public <br/>\nwelfare.&#39;&quot; - &quot;the power of the state to enforce compulsory education <br/>\nof children within the state at some school is beyond question&quot;, <br/>\n- &quot;the juvenile court has authority to<br/>\nlimit a parent&#39;s control over a dependent child, including a parent&#39;s <br/>\nright to make educational decisions for a child&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe court here is stating that homeschooling in general is bad for <br/>\npublic welfare.

It&#39;s not always at it&#39;s best.  But we&#39;re not so fickle that we&#39;ve revoked voting rights or reestablished slavery. <br/>\n<br/>\n***.But it might not be &quot;alright&quot; with another member of society, and in <br/>\nthat situation you have a conflict *** <br/>\n<br/>\nOne way to avoid conflict is to think and act like everyone else.  <br/>\nTo never disagree when you think someone is wrong wouldn&#39;t necessarily avoid conflict because the &quot;wrong&quot; their doing may be causing conflict elsewhere.   To never stand up to oppressors wouldn&#39;t necessarily avoid conflict because the oppressed would still be suffering.   When is it right to be different or to speak out or to call for change or take action to make change?  <br/>\n<br/>\nConflict is not always the worst thing that could happen.  In the case of spanking, conflict that would result (I&#39;m thinking court cases, some rantings in blogs, fundamentalist breakaway groups determined to forge their own little nations where the godly act of smacking kids is protected as a parent&#39;s right, maybe some especially busy and /or violent activism - the spankers march of ten thousand moms descending on DC and spanking their kids knowing they can&#39;t all be arrested)  Might not be worse than generations of kids growing up with violence inflicted upon them in their homes by their parents.  It might not be worse than continuing to think of children as the property of their parents.  It might not be worse than an acknowledgement of ones right to not be assaulted. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe positive gains for some years of social unrest are sometimes worth the social unrest.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***when societal members have a <br/>\nconflict the only way to solve the conflict is to acquiesce to <br/>\nthe &quot;might makes right&quot; mentality. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a not so secret delight in violence.&lt;g&gt; I think violence is usually the most effective way to quickly solve a problem. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a long term solution, unless you kill *all* the other guys,  but it does seem to work in the moment.  I suspect lots of folks feel that way and that&#39;s why they smack their kids.  I reckon humans have a long history of that kind of problem solving and it won&#39;t be changed by changing our form of government.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t see all societal conflict - in the way we usually see it when it occurs in America today - as necessarily worse than the thing we&#39;re conflicted over.   <br/>\nThe Civil Rights Movement was not a more harmful thing to society than the denial of the right to vote.  <br/>\nI think if we made assaulting children illegal it would be worth the wrath of those who would oppose it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not defending schools and I would personally like to see an end to compulsory attendance laws.  But not addressing the problem of child abuse because we&#39;re afraid of conflict over homeschooling rights would be irresponsible and just pretty darn crappy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the original worry here was that California would suddenly become a place where parents couldn&#39;t homeschool their kids.   The court document said that there were several exemptions from the California law of compulsory attendance and this family had not sufficiently met any of those exemptions.   That there are hundreds (or thousands? I don&#39;t know) of families homeschooling in California suggests that many families successfully exempt their children and this parent could have too.   It seems a case where a person put his own religious or political agenda before the welfare of his children.  It&#39;s possible that no matter what kind of a nut he wanted to be he could have successfully exempted his kid and he didn&#39;t.   Abuse, if he was abusive, is not a homeschooling issue.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, if the parent was abusive,  I don&#39;t think the power and authority of the parent over his kids was preferable to the state&#39;s power over the parent.  I think the unchecked power of parents over children is more dangerous than the power of a state over an individual because the state&#39;s power can be changed by voters (or an angry mob&lt;g&gt;) and an abusive parent&#39;s power can rarely be questioned or changed by a little kid. <br/>\n<br/>\n***That is the biggest issue I have <br/>\nwith society&#39;s authority, &quot;might makes right&quot; is the only direction <br/>\nin which it can move.***<br/>\n<br/>\nHow you might change it and what you might change it to will take special consideration if you hope to avoid conflict.  <br/>\n <br/>\n***&quot;Humans are imperfect&quot; is nothing but propaganda, it is completely<br/>\nuntrue, I posit that nothing can be a more perfect human than a<br/>\nhuman.***<br/>\n<br/>\nHumans are well suited to do what humans do.  That doesn&#39;t make us perfect.   We&#39;re not always perfect in our logic, in our decision making.  We&#39;re not always perfect parents.   In lots of ways we&#39;re inferior to many of our fellow Earthlings.
