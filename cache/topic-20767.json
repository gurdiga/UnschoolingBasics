So we try to have a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2007093987\">I have an eleven yo (Josh) as well. I think one of the best things about our unschooling is <br/>\nthat the focus is on relationships, right? So we try to have a relationship where the kids <br/>\nWANT to be with us. By spending time with me, they see what I&#39;m doing, they see the <br/>\nsteps, they have a chance to help if they care to. Very frequently whomever is hanging out <br/>\nwith me in the kitchen will ask what they can do to help. The model is me, when they are <br/>\nhaving trouble, asking what *I* can do to help. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe may have a different situation, because with so many people in one house, there is the <br/>\nexpectation that everyone does what they can to help. Children are involved from very <br/>\nyoung, happily, in toting around laundry, stirring food, dusting. If I really want to finish <br/>\nsomething, they know that they have me if they need me, but are just as likely to join in <br/>\nwhen I ask if I can finish something &#39;real quick&#39;. They are with me and I say &quot;Do you mind <br/>\nhelping me carry this laundry downstairs?&quot; or &quot;Can you stir this sauce while I start the <br/>\nwater boiling?&quot; That&#39;s an incremental step, but they build up after a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone is asking for help, I always try to stop right there and help them. Not only are <br/>\nyou saying that you&#39;re &#39;here to help&#39; (ack...too much koala brothers!), but they are wanting <br/>\nto learn right then, and you can step them through. Josh can&#39;t remember phone numbers <br/>\nto friends or places, and nearly always needs help finding them in the phone book. He <br/>\nknows where to get the phone books, but still needs help finding the specific person or <br/>\nplace. Sometimes I can talk him through it, sometimes he just needs me there. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the hardest part to remember is that they are where they are. Just age should not <br/>\ndefine what one thinks a child should be able to do (and I guess I learned that lesson early <br/>\nhaving a child with autism) It doesn&#39;t matter what an eleven year old &#39;should&#39; be able to do, <br/>\nit&#39;s an artificial construct anyway, based on professional opinions of psychologists who&#39;ve <br/>\nnever met your child. What&#39;s important to look at is what your son CAN do, and how to <br/>\nbuild on that in a supporting manner. It can be hard, I won&#39;t deny that, but often the <br/>\nrealization that someday they&#39;ll be adults and won&#39;t WANT our help can stifle the bitter <br/>\nfeelings. I still remember the hurt look on my dad&#39;s face (he&#39;s always one for giving advice, <br/>\nwhether you want it or not) the day I told him to stop telling me what to do! I was nearly <br/>\n25...had four kids and he still couldn&#39;t let go. It&#39;s just as bad to tell a child that they HAVE <br/>\nto let go of their parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps, I tend to ramble when kids don&#39;t want my attentions ;-)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: encouraging independence?","postDate":"1168966010","msgId":20785,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVvaXZocStkbmZiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVvZ3BoMSszZjMxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20779,"nextInTopic":20789,"prevInTime":20784,"nextInTime":20786,"topicId":20767,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... started, ...

Sometimes my stepson <br/>\n(13) needs to actually watch someone do something several times, <br/>\nand/or get really specific step-by-step instruction several times <br/>\nbefore he feels the confidence to try it himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things he&#39;s been learning since he came to live with us <br/>\nin November is to make simple foods - we&#39;re talking *really* simple, <br/>\ntoo, like jello. I start out just making things and asking if he&#39;d <br/>\nlike to watch. After a couple times I&#39;ll ask if he wants to make it <br/>\nwith help, help me or if I should just do it? Somewhere along the <br/>\nline I&#39;ll be in the middle of something and he&#39;ll initiate making it <br/>\nhimself, but asking me for step-by-step instructions while he&#39;s <br/>\ndoing it. He can&#39;t stand to read, and doesn&#39;t really listen if I <br/>\nread directions to him - I have to paraphrase into something more <br/>\nconversational. Eventually he remembers how to do it himself. That&#39;s <br/>\nbeen the progression with soup, mac-n-cheese, and now jello. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it never fails, when I am doing just about anything, he suddenly <br/>\n&gt; needs something (a snack made, help finding his shoes, help <br/>\n </span></blockquote>finding <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a phone number, etc) that he could probably do for himself, if he <br/>\n&gt; would just try.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do you respond in these kinds of situations? Some of this sounds <br/>\nlike a desire for reassurance that his mom will always &quot;be there&quot; <br/>\nfor him, so if you are snapping and saying &quot;I&#39;m in the middle of <br/>\nsomething, do it yourself&quot; that only aggravates the need. I try to <br/>\nbe alert for times when Ray seems to be at a loss and offer to give <br/>\nhim a hand before he asks - &quot;Do you need a snack? I can get you one <br/>\njust as soon as I finish these dishes. What would you like?&quot; There&#39;s <br/>\na big difference in the implications, there. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I&#39;m used to keeping in mind wrt my 5yr old, and am <br/>\nnow having to translate into my thinking about Ray is &quot;autonomy is <br/>\nnot the same as independence&quot;. I want my kids to be Autonomous, and <br/>\npart of what that means is I want them to be able to decide when <br/>\nthey need help and ask for it. Its possible, when trying to promote <br/>\nIndependence, to undermine Autonomy - to give the message that <br/>\nneeding assistance is a bad thing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He has problems with a <br/>\n&gt; game he&#39;s playing, he gets upset, and doesn&#39;t even try to problem <br/>\n&gt; solve.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Plenty of adults have trouble problem solving. When I worked in a <br/>\nfabric shop there were days when it seemed like all I did was help <br/>\nother adults figure things out. How do *you* solve problems at home? <br/>\nI try to make my internal processes a bit more obvious around my <br/>\nkids - talking out loud instead of keeping it all in my head, or <br/>\neven bouncing ideas off them the way I would another adult. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13 - in Liberty TN, are you my almost-<br/>\nneighbor, Betsy?!?)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":267954153,"authorName":"Brian & Alexandra Polikowsky","from":"&quot;Brian & Alexandra Polikowsky&quot; &lt;polykow@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: encouraging independence?","postDate":"1168920732","msgId":20779,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjMwMWM3MzkyNCQ4MDE1ZDliMCQ2NDU4YThjMEBPZmZpY2U+","referencesHeader":"PGVvaDN2Nys4YXI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20775,"nextInTopic":20785,"prevInTime":20778,"nextInTime":20780,"topicId":20767,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Again I have not time...sorry.
