Or, maybe, take off the ones you&#39;ve been wearing that divides living into &#39;academics&#39; and &#39;not academics&#39;. Living is learning. They may never come to you and say &quot;Mama we&#39;d LOVE for you to sit us down with an algebra workbook.&quot; Or &quot;Mama can you teach us about pterodactyls&quot;...or ancient Egypt or whatever. That doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t absorb information about Egypt, algebra and whatever. It just won&#39;t look as clearly quantifiable as school academics do. You may not know they&#39;ve even learned about Queen Hatshepsut until something pops up in conversation or on Cash Cab or wherever and they pop out the information.<br/>\nUntil they are confident that a simple question is not going to turn into a &quot;lesson&quot;, they&#39;re not likely to ask anything. Take it slowly in that regard. If they ask a question &quot;what kind of flower is that?&quot; while you&#39;re out walking, answer it - if you know what it is, tell them &quot;That&#39;s a geranium&quot;; if not, let them know that you don&#39;t know but you can find out. DON&#39;T make it into a &quot;let&#39;s go home and research it&quot; project. If you don&#39;t know and you get home and they still want to know, YOU look it up and report back. If they want to sit beside you while you look, okay; if not, also okay. If you find that lots of flower questions keep coming up, bookmark a couple of good websites or get a nice, colorfully illustrated field guide to use as a reference. For you. Over time, they might or they might not, start looking things up themselves so they don&#39;t have to wait for you to do it. If the interest in flowers keeps coming up, look for garden club tours and plant your own flower garden and whatever else - not as &quot;academic&quot; lessons but simply because that&#39;s what your child enjoys.<br/>\nIt&#39;s much like dating - you don&#39;t try &#39;teaching&#39; your beloved about new stuff and making lessons about things. You DO look for what interests that person and how you can pleasure that person by bringing MORE of that around &quot;oh look Love, a new Thai restaurant just opened nearby. I know you love Thai food - how about we go there this Friday?&quot; And, at the same time, you&#39;re exposing them to the things you love &quot;I really love Norwegian death metal bands - Megaskeladark is my favorite.&quot; He may never love it, but odds are good that if he spots an album by Megaskeladark that you don&#39;t have, he might pick it up or at least ask you if you want him to pick it up for you while he&#39;s out and about. And, you might see that Vietnamese food is (or isn&#39;t) like Thai food and suggest a Vietnamese restaurant one week - expanding the boundaries to something you might both enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb R<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

Academic interests may or may not come later, but 8, 6 and 1 are better ages for playing with dolls and creating stories and myths and adventures. Get down on the floor and play with them. Play with them lots and lots. The more you sit and be with them the more you will see that they are actively learning and doing and the easier it will be to offer other things for them to do. Not things that move them away from their interests, but things that move them into their interests more.

Mostly, they spend their days playing with each other and entertaining themselves..  making up dances and videos, making paper dolls, playing a video game here and there.
