Who can better lead him & teach him that you? And who can argue (not even school teachers) that your child will learn more, learn faster & advance farther one on one with you as opposed to a class room.

I just wish I had <br/>\nthe time just now to reply to each of you independently but I need <br/>\nto get dinner together sometime in the near future! LOL! I haven&#39;t <br/>\nbeen so excited about life in general since I made my decision, <br/>\nfinally, to at least homeschool or possibly unschool my kids. <br/>\nUnschooling is an exciting idea to me that I am only learning about <br/>\nin the last week or so since really jumping into the &#39;pool&#39; of the <br/>\ninternet and all the lovely resources it has to offer! I&#39;d really <br/>\ndragged my feet on making the decision up until now, likely because <br/>\nI KNEW my MIL was so opposed to the whole idea. She is more like my <br/>\nmother than my own (who for various reason&#39;s I&#39;ve not seen for over <br/>\na decade, but that&#39;s a whole other story) and her opinion has <br/>\nweighed heavily on me. Then again, she&#39;s pretty freaked out about <br/>\nthe co-sleeping arraingement that I&#39;ve enjoyed w/ my kids since they <br/>\nwere born and I&#39;ve not &#39;bent to her wishes&#39; on that score either, so <br/>\nI guess I have some sort of backbone back there somewhere.. haha! <br/>\nI&#39;ve just decided that traditional school isn&#39;t the right place for <br/>\nmy kids. My son especially, would be &#39;broken&#39; by that sort of <br/>\neducation, I think. He is somewhat speech delayed and a very <br/>\nsensitive soul and I know it would crush the sweetness and light I <br/>\nsee in him everyday to go into a situation like traditional school. <br/>\nLuckily for me, my husband (of 15 yrs now, we put off having kids a <br/>\nlong time, wanting to be financially &#39;sound&#39;[if there is such a <br/>\nthing] enough for me to stay home with them full time, and I am so <br/>\nglad I went with my gut there as well!!!!) is supportive of my <br/>\ndecision to educate the kids at home. I&#39;ve not really discussed un-<br/>\nschooling with him much yet. Want to get a more solid grasp on the <br/>\ninformation myself before trying to present it to him yet... But he <br/>\nis supportive of my efforts, at least for the first few years. I <br/>\ntold him that was a fair support and we would reassess after we see <br/>\nhow the kids and I are after a few years. I figure and hope that the <br/>\nresults will speak for themselves. I have faith that they will. <br/>\nFaith in my kids to continue being the fabulous people they continue <br/>\nto grow into everyday and faith in myself to be courageous enough to <br/>\nALLOW them to do so... Like I said, I am excited by all I&#39;ve read <br/>\nand perhaps this is the first time I&#39;ve actually done <br/>\nany &#39;unschooling&#39; myself! LOL! I can&#39;t get my hands on enough <br/>\ninformation, websites and books on the subject and spend all my <br/>\nspare time (considering I have a 2 and 3 yr old, and a house to run <br/>\netc, that&#39;s a finite thing, as I am sure you all understand!) <br/>\nlearning about it... Naturally, I am trying to balance my excitement <br/>\nin order to leave enough time to play with, color with, read to and <br/>\ngrow with my kids! I read somewhere once that the key to a happy <br/>\nlife is to have just a little more to do everyday than you can <br/>\npossibly get done, and I, more and more, believe that is the truth!! <br/>\nWell.....

My parents are okay with the homeschooling aspect -- my Mom is totally onboard with the academic aspects of unschooling, it&#39;s the radical parenting she rejects.  My Dad assumes I&#39;m homeschooling traditionally, but has never asked for details -- I see no reason to enlighten him.  For me, their opinions matter not at all, and when/if we disagree I have no problem pointing that I&#39;m the mom and they&#39;re only a grandparent, so don&#39;t push me.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  With the inlaws, it&#39;s a whole different situation.  Dh&#39;s Mom is a retired school teacher (k-3) who just can&#39;t wrap her mind around why we&#39;d homeschool at all, or that the boys could be happy not in school.  His Dad is retired military, who just &#39;does the next thing&#39; without ever questioning anything in life -- once you&#39;ve done A, then you do B, and so on.  However, they are very nice people, dh is an only child and overall much more compliant and kinder a person than I am. &lt;eg&gt;  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We routinely get questions about how homeschooling is going, what are the boys learning, and ideas for &#39;projects&#39; -- got one just last week where my mil said:  <br/>\n   <br/>\n    Sylvia, how are the boys coming along with their homeschooling?  Trips to the museum/zoo and activities with their fellow homeschoolers must keep them busy.  I was just thinking about a writing project for Andrew--how about he wrote letters to us?  This way, he&#39;ll develop his creative writing as well as handwriting skills, learn about the postal system, etc.  We in turn could write regularly to him and encourage him.  Just a thought.<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n  My first reaction was to roll my eyes, and tell dh.  He&#39;d already seen the email, and was thinking about a response to her.  He said, &quot;Andy already knows how the postal system works and my handwriting is bad -- what does she expect from him and us?&quot;<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;ve fielded questions from her over the years. I&#39;ve explained that we don&#39;t use a curriculum, that we follow the boys&#39; interests, even mentioned Holt&#39;s name, thinking that as a teacher in the 60&#39;s & 70&#39;s she might be familiar with his theories -- I even referred to open classrooms once. I&#39;ve never used the word unschooling, tho I did share with them a link to my blog, where I openly talk about our life and unschooling.  I doubt they&#39;ve ever visited.  Gary says even if she had, she&#39;d never mention something she doesn&#39;t agree with -- it&#39;s more her style to advance her &#39;helpful suggestions&#39; and see if I&#39;ll bite.  I explained to him that I&#39;m ready to tell her to bite me. &lt;weg&gt;  Really, I&#39;m at the point where all I want to say is &quot;we&#39;re their parents, you&#39;re the grandparents and you had your chance.&quot;   I mean, hey, if she wants to write letters (Gary said, why not emails) I&#39;ll encourage the boys to write back -- if it&#39;s for the honest goal of getting better acquainted, but I<br/>\n will not have their letters &#39;graded.&#39;  Gary is convinced what she wants is benchmarks to compare Andy with Gary&#39;s cousins&#39; children.   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  After much discussion, we decided he&#39;ll respond -- in fact, from now on, he gets to respond to all their questions about homeschooling because I&#39;m not able to promise I&#39;ll be gracious.  When he gets around to emailing them, I&#39;ll share what he posted if it seems helpful.  Personally, I&#39;m ready to tell them to bug off. My parents aren&#39;t hurt when I tell them that, since that&#39;s just &#39;Sylvia being too sensitive.&#39;  His parents would be deeply hurt -- or at least they&#39;d convince him they were.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  In my fantasies, I tell them where to get off -- in real life, dealing with inlaws is a bit more difficult.

Many people who are not in the homeschooling world, picture homeschooling as the kids sitting at home all day with mom &quot;teaching&quot; them the way that teachers do OR even worse, just sitting learning from textbooks on their own.  I would specifically address her fears.  Let her know that while socializing was difficult before, there are tons of resources and groups for kids who are homeschooled.  The kids will be able to visit with other kids several times a week and spend hours interacting, playing, working on projects together (let her envision science projects if that is what helps her, I&#39;m sure at some point your kids will embark on some sort of science-ish project with a friend or two), etc.  They&#39;ll also have lots of time to interact with other adults and learn how to behave properly in society (if that is the type of socialization that she is worried about).  In fact they&#39;ll be able to learn how to act in society by interacting in real places.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as integrating into the real world, I wouldn&#39;t even get into arguing that they live in the real world now... but tell her that they&#39;ll have opportunities to learn in real world situations that will help get them ready.  Then talk about how the colleges are finding that homeschoolers are more succesful than their schooled counterparts (both public and private) and that many universities are setting up special scholarships and some are actively recruiting homeschoolers because they do so well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, talk about how dangerous all schools have become and how bullying has become such a huge issue at all schools, including private schools (maybe even worse at private schools).  Let her think about kids she sees at the store and hears about, does she want her grandkids like them?<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, her concerns are coming from a place of love.  I&#39;d try to very gradually over the next few years chip away at her concerns by talking to her in a loving manner and letting her know all of the great things you are learning about homeschooled kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlene<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Overcoming Objections from InLaws?","postDate":"1163709675","msgId":18986,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYxMTE2MjA0MTE1LjUxNjc3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzODA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVqaTZvNCtva2xrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18985,"nextInTopic":18989,"prevInTime":18985,"nextInTime":18987,"topicId":18964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We get opposition here, too.

I recently was thinking about my <br/>\ndad and his<br/>\nworries about my home-educated children (unschooling isn&#39;t a term he <br/>\nbandies<br/>\nabout). For his mother education was a very important ideal. And his <br/>\nmother was<br/>\nhis world in a lot of ways, for a long time. Knowing that helps me to <br/>\nunderstand<br/>\nand respond to his fears about my children. Fortunately my in-laws <br/>\naren&#39;t likely<br/>\nto question our decisions, since I can better dictate my relationships <br/>\nwith and<br/>\nresponses to my own parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven your children&#39;s ages, I woudn&#39;t really even talk about <br/>\nhomeschooling with<br/>\nyour mother-in-law. Since you&#39;ve already brought up the possibility, I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t<br/>\ntalk about it much. And if they bring it up, you can put them off with <br/>\n&quot;Well,<br/>\nwe&#39;ll see how it goes. I can always change my mind.&quot; And then talk <br/>\nabout some of<br/>\nthe exciting things you are doing, talk about what your days are filled <br/>\nwith and<br/>\nhow wonderful your life is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that she is prepared to pay for her grandchildren to go to <br/>\nprivate<br/>\nschool, not an inexpensive offer, suggests that she is really concerned <br/>\nabout<br/>\ntheir well-being. Not that you should take her up on her offer, but <br/>\nmaybe if you<br/>\ncan see the offer as a generous one instead of an aggressive, <br/>\nmanipulative one<br/>\nit might be easier for you. It also suggests that she doesn&#39;t trust you <br/>\nto be<br/>\nable to make decisions on your own. Next time she questions your <br/>\ndecision,<br/>\ndeeply questions your decision, have books and papers and articles <br/>\ntogether to<br/>\nhand to her. Be able to talk up the benefits of homeschooling. If she <br/>\npulls the<br/>\nsocialization card, talk about what you are doing to address those <br/>\nthings. Ask<br/>\nher how an artificial system like school, where children are segregated <br/>\nbased on<br/>\nage, can truly socialize someone. Ask her what kind of socialization <br/>\nshe thinks<br/>\nschool offers. Ask her how separating her grandchildren off from the <br/>\nreal world<br/>\ncan help them to be more integrated into the real world. But it is a <br/>\nfine line<br/>\nto walk, you have to try not to make her feel backed into a corner. Try <br/>\nand keep<br/>\nit light and easy. Which is hard since you may feel backed into a <br/>\ncorner. Make<br/>\nsure you are confident about what you are choosing.

My MIL is VERY OPPOSED to the idea of me homeschooling my<br/>\nchildren. Likely that is the reason I&#39;ve put off the decision this<br/>\nlong to decide to do it. She thinks kids need to be &#39;socialized&#39;<br/>\nand &#39;integrated&#39; in order for them to deal with the &#39;real world&#39; that<br/>\nthey will have to join &#39;some day&#39;. I&#39;ve put her off saying that my<br/>\noldest son is only 3 1/2 and I&#39;d not be putting him in school until he<br/>\nwas at least six anyway and so we have some time (figuring I&#39;ll just<br/>\ndo what I want and homeschool, but that it&#39;d buy me some time of<br/>\ncomplaining from her). She is so opposed that she has told me that<br/>\nshe&#39;ll pay the entire bill for any private school I choose if I want<br/>\nso badly to keep them out of public... Please help! Any ideas would be<br/>\ngreat!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1) These are *your* children, not hers. She got to make her own <br/>\ndecisions with her children. If she&#39;s not happy with the choices her <br/>\nson makes, whose fault/problem is that?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Until she&#39;s willing to study up on unschooling and be as informed as <br/>\nyou are and can carry on an INTELLIGENT conversation on the subject, <br/>\nthe topic is CLOSED. You can give her websites and books and articles. <br/>\n*After* she has completed the *assignment*, then you&#39;ll be ready to <br/>\ntalk. Until then, she&#39;s simply ignorant and uninformed and can butt <br/>\nout.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she&#39;s not willing to learn more, well, that&#39;s just an example of a <br/>\nschooled personality and that&#39;s not what you want for your child. You <br/>\nwant him to question and seek new information all his life.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) If she thinks schooled children are actually living in the &quot;real <br/>\nworld&quot; or even something similar, she&#39;s woefully mistaken. Unschooled <br/>\nchildre are *truly* lliving in the real world all the time, unlike <br/>\nschooled children, who are in a *simulated* world and may join teh real <br/>\nworld &quot;some day.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n4) We figured the amount we spent on private school ($10,000 per child) <br/>\ncould buy us some SERIOUS trips to REAL places instead of just reading <br/>\nabout them and doing papers and projects on them. TEN THOUSAND <br/>\ndollars/year??? We can GO to the Grand Canyon, to Australia, to <br/>\nScotland, to Minnesooota! The amount she would spend on 12 years <br/>\ntuition could enable the WHOLE family to travel the world twice over! <br/>\nIt also buys some handsome musical instruments and memberships to every <br/>\nmusuem within driving distance. It&#39;ll buy games and camera and swimming <br/>\npools and bee hives and chicken coops and a library of Usborne books <br/>\n---and a new van to drive all those places.<br/>\n<br/>\nTen thousand dollars/year could pay for you to EXPERIENCE all the <br/>\nthings you could only READ about in school.  What a waste!<br/>\n<br/>\nNO! ---better!  You&#39;ll be sending him to THE best private school money <br/>\ncan buy---with often a teacher-student ratio of 1-4 teachers to ONE <br/>\nstudent!

As for private school, I don&#39;t see that as a solution to public education. You&#39;re still placing your child&#39;s life and education in the hands of someone else who is dealing with him AND 20 other kids!  Who better knows your child that you? Who can better lead him & teach him that you?  And who can argue (not even school teachers) that your child will learn more, learn faster & advance farther one on one with you as opposed to a class room.  As long as you and your husband are in agreement and both want to do this, maybe she&#39;ll have to just put on her big girl panties & deal with it! :-)<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nMarsha<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helped.<br/>\n&quot;Someone needs exactly what you have been given by God.

I recently was thinking about my dad and his worries about my home-educated children (unschooling isn&#39;t a term he bandies about). For his mother education was a very important ideal. And his mother was his world in a lot of ways, for a long time. Knowing that helps me to understand and respond to his fears about my children. Fortunately my in-laws aren&#39;t likely to question our decisions, since I can better dictate my relationships with and responses to my own parents. <br/>\n<br/>\nGiven your children&#39;s ages, I woudn&#39;t really even talk about homeschooling with your mother-in-law. Since you&#39;ve already brought up the possibility, I wouldn&#39;t talk about it much. And if they bring it up, you can put them off with &quot;Well, we&#39;ll see how it goes. I can always change my mind.&quot; And then talk about some of the exciting things you are doing, talk about what your days are filled with and how wonderful your life is. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that she is prepared to pay for her grandchildren to go to private school, not an inexpensive offer, suggests that she is really concerned about their well-being. Not that you should take her up on her offer, but maybe if you can see the offer as a generous one instead of an aggressive, manipulative one it might be easier for you. It also suggests that she doesn&#39;t trust you to be able to make decisions on your own. Next time she questions your decision, deeply questions your decision, have books and papers and articles together to hand to her. Be able to talk up the benefits of homeschooling. If she pulls the socialization card, talk about what you are doing to address those things. Ask her how an artificial system like school, where children are segregated based on age, can truly socialize someone. Ask her what kind of socialization she thinks school offers. Ask her how separating her grandchildren off from the real world can help them to be more integrated into the real world. But it is a fine line to walk, you have to try not to make her feel backed into a corner. Try and keep it light and easy. Which is hard since you may feel backed into a corner. Make sure you are confident about what you are choosing.

But you certainly don&#39;t have to tell your MIL you&#39;re unschooling, I wouldn&#39;t open that can of worms for as long as you can possibly avoid it. Not that unschooling is a can of worms, but jumping from public school to unschooling is a pretty large conceptual leap, and not one that would come easily for someone not reviewing the same sort of information that you are. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the day, how you raise your children is your choice. But how you present it and how defensive you make your extended family feel may make a difference to how comfortable they are with your choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Heather <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, November 16, 2006 5:22 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Overcoming Objections from InLaws?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi All.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am just hoping for ideas on overcoming objections to Homeschooling <br/>\n  from InLaws.

I know it&#39;s hard.  But the best thing I think I can say <br/>\nto you is that your children are YOUR children and you must raise them as <br/>\nYOU see fit.  Your mother-in-law has raised her children.  While she may <br/>\nhave done a lovely job, she did it in a different time, maybe in a different <br/>\nplace, and with different children.  She can think whatever she wants, but <br/>\nthe bottom line is that it is your time to raise your children and she needs <br/>\nto respect that.  My in-laws hardly approve of a THING that I do, and <br/>\ncertainly don&#39;t approve of our homeschooling.  But I&#39;ve told them that while <br/>\nI appreciate that they care about my children very much, they need to <br/>\nunderstand that my husband and I make the decisions and they need to respect <br/>\nthat.  I know it may be easier said than done to get them to back off, but <br/>\nsetting the tone of your relationship with your in-laws is probably a good <br/>\nthing to do sooner than later.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to socialization, you might want to read the article at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tnhomeed.com/LRSocial.html\">http://www.tnhomeed.com/LRSocial.html</a> .   I think it addresses it all really <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnecdotally, I can tell you that my older son went to preschool, 6 hours a <br/>\nweek, for two school years.  He is shy, doesn&#39;t talk to strangers much, is <br/>\nprone to giving one word answers to people he doesn&#39;t know, and might be <br/>\nconsidered &quot;unsocialized.&quot;  But he&#39;s great with other kids, articulate and <br/>\nintelligent with people he knows, and possessing of better manners and <br/>\nsocial skills, once comfortable with someone, than most adults I know.  On <br/>\nthe other hand, my 6 year old NEVER went to preschool or to public school <br/>\nand he is the most social animal you can imagine.  He will chat with anyone, <br/>\nanytime, any place regardless of their age, physical appearance or social <br/>\nstatus.  He&#39;s the kind of kid who makes adults&#39; jaws drop at how well he <br/>\ncommunicates with adults and children alike.<br/>\n<br/>\nSocialization, by definition, is the process of learning and adopting the <br/>\nbehavior patterns of the community in which a person or animal lives.  If <br/>\nyou think about it, there is little resemblence between the behavior <br/>\npatterns of schools, public or private, and the &quot;real world.&quot;  That article <br/>\nI cited illustrates this well. Socialization has become a catch phrase for <br/>\nbecoming overly friendly with strangers, blindly trusting of authority <br/>\nfigures, docile and unquestioning of information presented by those <br/>\nauthority figures, agist and prone to think with pack mentality, among other <br/>\nthings.  None of these are things I want for my children.  I want them to <br/>\nquestion everything, be curious about everything, to express their feelings, <br/>\nto be reasonably cautious with people they don&#39;t know, not think with the <br/>\npack, and more.  Yes, I want them to be mannerly, respectful and decent. <br/>\nBut from what I see, they won&#39;t learn that in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say you should do what YOU see fit, as a parent, and make the <br/>\nparenting decisions you think are the best ones for your children.  If <br/>\nothers question your decisions, well, that&#39;s ok.  Even if they offer to <br/>\nthrow cash at you to think their way, I&#39;d resist.  Politely decline and do <br/>\nwhat you think is best.  I&#39;d venture to say nobody knows your children like <br/>\nyou do.

My MIL is VERY OPPOSED to the idea of me homeschooling my<br/>\n&gt; children. Likely that is the reason I&#39;ve put off the decision this<br/>\n&gt; long to decide to do it. She thinks kids need to be &#39;socialized&#39;<br/>\n&gt; and &#39;integrated&#39; in order for them to deal with the &#39;real world&#39; that<br/>\n&gt; they will have to join &#39;some day&#39;. I&#39;ve put her off saying that my<br/>\n&gt; oldest son is only 3 1/2 and I&#39;d not be putting him in school until he<br/>\n&gt; was at least six anyway and so we have some time (figuring I&#39;ll just<br/>\n&gt; do what I want and homeschool, but that it&#39;d buy me some time of<br/>\n&gt; complaining from her). She is so opposed that she has told me that<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;ll pay the entire bill for any private school I choose if I want<br/>\n&gt; so badly to keep them out of public... Please help!
