If so, it&#39;s enough. Keep strewing, but don&#39;t do that with the idea that &quot;THIS is what&#39;s going to get them excited!&quot; - do it because you know them, and you know what their interests are, and you want to share something interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is really, really content at home, connecting with friends online. When he goes out anywhere, as soon as we&#39;re done doing what we said we were doing, he&#39;s immediately ready to come home. It&#39;s who he is, right now, and I don&#39;t have a need for him to have more friends or be more involved in the community, or want to be out more. He&#39;s happy, and excited by what he does do at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read about different personality types - introvert/extrovert? Introverts recharge their energy by being alone, extroverts by being around people. Introverts feel drained after being around groups of people, or sometimes in loud places. They can do it, and most *enjoy* parties, being around other people, but they&#39;re ultimately drained by it, and need alone time to recharge. The extrovert is certainly more &quot;rewarded&quot; in our society, and in school, and one of the real joys of unschooling is the ability to celebrate our kids for who they are, without the desire for them to be anyone other than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis could be a really helpful time for you to look within, and ask yourSELF why you have these fears around your kids and what brings them enjoyment.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nCaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41064,"nextTopicId":40935}}
