About once every 5 or 6 weeks grandma (my<br/>\nhusbands mom) call and asks to have the girls for a few days. It is<br/>\nnormally for 2 or 3 days but one time it was for 5 days. My oldest<br/>\ndaughter is having a hard time staying at grandmas for any length of<br/>\ntime. This last time we dropped her off in the morning and I hung out<br/>\nat my MIL&#39;s for a bit- went to a doctors appt- came back for an hour<br/>\nor two then left to pick up my hubby so we could go to dinner with my<br/>\nmom. About 9pm my MIL called saying my 7 year old was crying and<br/>\nsaying she wanted to come home. I spoke with my daughter and said &quot;Do<br/>\nyou want to come home&quot; and she said yes so I said okay we will come<br/>\nget you. I didn&#39;t ask why. We just went and got her. For a few weeks<br/>\nshe complained about my MIL&#39;s husband saying he was grouchy. I do<br/>\nunderstand that- he can be. I just felt like something else was going<br/>\non. Now that I have been typing I feel like 5 days for her without<br/>\nseeing me and her dad was hard on her. It may have been pretty scary<br/>\ntoo.
