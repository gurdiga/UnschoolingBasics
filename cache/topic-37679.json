Google for &quot;repair wet electronics&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;repair wet cellphone&quot; or &quot;drying out wet phone&quot;.  Water doesn&#39;t always<br/>\nruin electronics.  Circuit boards are rinsed in water as part of the<br/>\nmanufacturing process.  What breaks them is the short-curcuits caused by the<br/>\nbattery being installed, so a current is coursing through the board when it<br/>\ngets wet.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy wife&#39;s purse fell in a canal a few years ago and in it she had a Canon<br/>\nElph digital camera, her Palm Treo cell, and an mp3 player.  The purse was<br/>\ndrenched.  Water was dripping from the electronics.  I pulled the batteries<br/>\n(except the mp3 player, which didn&#39;t have a removable battery) and when we<br/>\ngot back to the hotel I put all 3 devices in front of a warm hair dryer (not<br/>\ntoo hot) for about 6 hours, then left them to passively dry for another 2<br/>\ndays.  Reinstalled the batteries, and they all worked fine except for the<br/>\nmp3 player.  This is one reason I avoid buying items (like ipods) that have<br/>\nnon-removable batteries.  If it gets wet, yank the battery as soon as<br/>\npossible!<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year I bought my 3 y/o son a Cowon A2 Personal Media Player (PMP)<br/>\nthat&#39;s similar to a video ipod but with a 4&quot; screen.  I was tired of dealing<br/>\nwith DVD disks for travels and daily car trips.  2 weeks after getting it,<br/>\nhe dropped it in the toilet (clean, thankfully).  I tried to revive it for a<br/>\nweek, then submitted it for warranty repair.  Usually warranties don&#39;t cover<br/>\nwater damage, and manufacturers actually put water-sensitive stickers on the<br/>\ninside of the device that change colors if an item has been submerged.  But<br/>\nin that instance they replaced it, thankfully.<br/>\n<br/>\n4 years ago I got in my car, at night, and put my iRiver mp3 player<br/>\n(hard-drive based) in the cup-holder in the console after I plugged in the<br/>\ncassette adaptor I was using to hear it via my car stereo.  Less than a mile<br/>\ndown the road, the music stopped.  When I picked up the player, my hand got<br/>\nwet.  A friend had used my car that day and spilled water in the console,<br/>\nand hadn&#39;t cleaned it up.  So my mp3 player was sitting in 2 inches of<br/>\nwater.  Dried it out with a hairdryer for a few hours, and it&#39;s still<br/>\nworking fine today.<br/>\n<br/>\n10 years ago, I had a cordless Uniden house phone that spent a night at the<br/>\nbottom of a hot tub.  I bought a new one immediately, then a month later a<br/>\nfriend told me the old one might still work.  He was right.  I put it on the<br/>\ncharger, it charged, and worked fine for another few years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo not all electronics can be revived after a water dunking, and I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how the washing machine soap would have added to the damage, but try to<br/>\ndry it out.

Let me explain, he&#39;s 13! I check pockets because I smoke and am terrified I&#39;ll burn down the house drying a lighter. BUT I break dishes frequently and figure it&#39;s part of life. My ex-husband was bad about cell phones (ran 1 over, left one on top of car) and I never got upset. It&#39;s part of life! Tell her she&#39;s human like all of us and we all forget things and make mistakes. <br/>\nSent from my Verizon Wireless BlackBerry<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Faith Void&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:littlemsvoid@...\">littlemsvoid@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDate: Thu, 8 Jan 2009 10:48:07 <br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] cell phone went through the washer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI second what Gail wrote about learning takes.
