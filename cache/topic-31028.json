The reason goat s milk works better for some people is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2146143387\">Goat&#39;s milk has lactose, too. So does human milk.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m lactose intolerant and so is my oldest daughter. The reason goat&#39;s  <br/>\nmilk works better for some people is that it is more digestible so the  <br/>\nbacteria don&#39;t get as much chance to have a feast on the undigested  <br/>\nstuff down there in the small intestines. (It is partying bacteria  <br/>\nthat create the gas that causes the bloating and discomfort.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLactaid doesn&#39;t help me much (I am SEVERELY lactose intolerant - there  <br/>\nare degrees, it isn&#39;t all or nothing). But there is another similar  <br/>\npill, called &quot;Digestive Advantage - Lactose Intolerance Therapy&quot; that  <br/>\ndoes work very very well. I only have to take one in the morning and I  <br/>\ncan get by, even have a small frozen yogurt or cream in my coffee. I  <br/>\nstill wouldn&#39;t drink a whole glass of milk - that would overload me.  <br/>\nThese are available at regular drug stores and grocery stores (Ralphs  <br/>\ncarries them).<br/>\n<br/>\nMilk protein allergy or sensitivity is different than lactose  <br/>\nintolerance. Lactose intolerance means our bodies don&#39;t produce  <br/>\n(enough or any) lactase, the enzyme that metaboliizes lactose (the  <br/>\nsugar in dairy products). Bacteria flourish in the small intestine  <br/>\nwith all that undigested sugar sitting there.<br/>\n<br/>\nLactose is an additive in LOTS of foods. Trying to totally avoid it is  <br/>\nvery very difficult - which is why I take the Digestive Advantage pill  <br/>\nevery day. Otherwise, I might inadvertently eat something with &quot;milk  <br/>\nsolids&quot; or &quot;whey&quot; or &quot;lactoserum&quot; or &quot;modified milk ingredients&quot; and  <br/>\nthen be miserable. It is often added to processed meats like lunch  <br/>\nmeats, margarines, breads, dried fruit, medications, protein bars, and  <br/>\nalmost any kind of processed foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - my youngest daughter knows a lot about nutrition and digestion.  <br/>\nShe picked up a lot of it at the time I was just figuring out what was  <br/>\nwrong with me, getting tests, freaking out thinking I had stomach  <br/>\ncancer or something. And, at the same time, she was very involved with  <br/>\nhorses - which have lots of their own digestive issues. She even made  <br/>\na cool model of a horses digestive system to enter in the youth fair  <br/>\none year.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now she&#39;s 17 and her boyfriend says he is lactose intolerant, but  <br/>\nshe&#39;s explained to him (and his mom) the difference between lactose  <br/>\nintolerance and milk protein allergy (which is what he has - when he  <br/>\naccidentally eats anything with dairy, his lips start to swell, his  <br/>\nthroat swells, he vomits, he has breathing problems).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh - and last thing (I promise) - most people become less and less  <br/>\nable to metabolize lactose as they get older. Lots of people can&#39;t  <br/>\nreally digest it well after about age 5 or so, but the symptoms are  <br/>\npretty minimal - gas, a little discomfort, loose stool. But if a kid  <br/>\ncomplains of discomfort in the lower stomach, especially if you can  <br/>\nhear it &quot;bubbling&quot; - you might suspect that they are having trouble  <br/>\ndigesting dairy. I cannot TELL you how much more healthy and energetic  <br/>\nI felt when I figured out what the problem was and got off the dairy.  <br/>\nPart of that was just sleeping better at night. So, I don&#39;t doubt that  <br/>\nbehavior problems can be associated with milk consumption, even when  <br/>\nit is just a mild lactose intolerance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be lactose intolerant because I mistakenly thought  <br/>\nit was most people with Asian background that had this problem. I was  <br/>\nwrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mar 18, 2008, at 6:03 PM, Adrean Clark wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a difference between lactose intolerance and protein allergy.<br/>\n&gt; Goat milk didn&#39;t work for me :( (protein allergy)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":238795563,"authorName":"Lisa","from":"&quot;Lisa&quot; &lt;jlblock01@...&gt;","profile":"jlblock01","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: dairy craving","postDate":"1205934094","msgId":31104,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZycjU2ZSszb3ZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNlOS4yYWZkZTEyNy4zNTExNjQ1Y0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31089,"nextInTopic":31113,"prevInTime":31103,"nextInTime":31105,"topicId":31028,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son is allergic to cow dairy but tolerates goat and sheep s milk cheeses etc just fine.

Our allergist told us that the protein in<br/>\ngoat&#39;s milk is the most similar to the protein in human milk.   My son<br/>\nalso LOVED milk and drank LOTS of milk until we figured out his<br/>\nallergy.   He threw up at least 3 times a day, didn&#39;t sleep and ended<br/>\nup in the emergency room multiple times with huge asthma attacks.   He<br/>\nwas 3 at the time.   When we discovered he was authentically allergic<br/>\nwe took steps to find alternatives for him (he is also allergic to<br/>\ntree nuts, egg yolks and soy)  it was hard to find things... soy milk<br/>\nis out, almond milk is out...but he loves rice milk so that works for<br/>\nus.  We changed to sheep&#39;s milk cheeses and goat cheeses (we all love<br/>\nthem!).   I use applesauce in place of egg yolks in cooking.... he<br/>\neats egg white omelets for breakfast etc.   When there are times when<br/>\nthere isn&#39;t an alternative we discuss what&#39;s in it and what it does to<br/>\nhim (all of his reactions are respiratory and have gotten milder<br/>\nthrough the years...he is almost 7 now)  I allow him to make the<br/>\ndecision to have a little bit of cake or ice cream at a party and we<br/>\nimmediately take allergy meds to alleviate any adverse reactions.   He<br/>\nknows how it makes his body feel and he will not eat more than a<br/>\nlittle because he does know that.  Recently he had a cookie at a class<br/>\n... took one bite and discovered it had walnuts... immediately he<br/>\ngrabbed my hand and told me the cookie had nuts ...he held the cookie<br/>\nin his mouth until he made it to a sink where he spit it out and<br/>\nrinsed his mouth and washed his hands... he was not upset or afraid<br/>\njust knew that nuts are dangerous for him.   I think if I walked<br/>\naround policing his life it would make him angry and anxious.  I try<br/>\nto make it a partnership of keeping him safe and healthy.  I find<br/>\nsometimes when we are at a party etc he will ask if something has<br/>\nmilk, nuts, soy, or eggs .. the hostess is always surprised that he<br/>\nknows so much about his allergies and takes the responsibility for his<br/>\nown health.   I get really annoyed when someone comes to me to &quot;check&quot;<br/>\nthat he is accurate or tries to talk him into having something that he<br/>\nhas refused on the basis of his allergies...
