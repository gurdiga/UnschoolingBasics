Maybe even change the subject by asking if anyone <br/>\nwants popcorn or ice-cream.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Mo&#39;s especially insulting and bossy, its generally a sign that <br/>\nI&#39;ve been too &quot;busy&quot; - getting wrapped up in my own projects or <br/>\nissues and not spending enough time hanging out with Mo. The more <br/>\ntime I (and/or George) can spend with her, actively modelling being <br/>\nkind and considerate, the more she&#39;s likely to ask for help or find <br/>\nsome other, skillful way of resolving problems, rather than lashing <br/>\nout when she&#39;s frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My kid&#39;s fight and argue a lot, including hitting and yelling and<br/>\n&gt; insulting, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mo and Ray go through phases where they bicker alot. I&#39;ve had to <br/>\nlearn to step back from that to some extent, other than trying to <br/>\nsee if there are unmet needs being expressed. It doesn&#39;t help to try <br/>\nto micromanage their relationship, it just adds more stress to *my* <br/>\nlife. Ultimately, they&#39;re pretty good at resolving things. It just <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t always look like a warm fuzzy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One other issue I need help on is my 9-yo. often criticizes and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>bosses<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; her younger sister around.

Does she feel like her own life <br/>\nis or has been &quot;hard&quot; in some way? It might be something to try and <br/>\ntalk with her about. Now and then I&#39;ll apologise to Ray for having <br/>\nbeen such a hard-ass when he was little. I don&#39;t dwell on it, but <br/>\nsometimes the conversation gets to a point where its appropriate. <br/>\nBetween that and actively doing things to be sweet to him, he seems <br/>\nto &quot;get&quot; why we are parenting Mo differently from the way we did him <br/>\nat the same age - not necessarily understand it from a philosophical <br/>\nstandpoing, but deep down at a gut level. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;A lot of it is that my siblings and I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; speak to each other except for a couple times a year.

You are not your mom, they are not you and <br/>\nyour siblings. So even interactions that superficially remind you of <br/>\nyour past are *not* the same. Those past relationships weren&#39;t <br/>\nembedded in a context of radical unschooling, for one thing. That&#39;s <br/>\na big difference. Think of other ways your family as a whole is <br/>\ndifferent from your own childhood for more reassurance.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 14)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77228268,"authorName":"Marla B.","from":"&quot;Marla B.&quot; &lt;marla@...&gt;","profile":"hilltowner4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: I&#39;m aggravating my kid&#39;s sibling rivalry","postDate":"1222529020","msgId":36241,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdibGo1cysyNmRpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdiZ25vYytwZGhjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36240,"nextInTopic":36246,"prevInTime":36240,"nextInTime":36242,"topicId":36189,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey Kelly, Thanks for letting me know I m not alone!
