It&#39;s using storytelling - not reading from<br/>\nbooks but your own storytelling - with your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI first read about it in Mothering magazine and this lead me to read one of<br/>\ntheir suggested resources &quot;Storytelling for Children&quot; by Nancy Mellon which<br/>\nis a great book to support anyone interested in discovering their inner<br/>\nstoryteller so to speak.  Nancy teaches storytelling as a &quot;healing art&quot;.  It<br/>\nis great tool for reflecting on and processing what&#39;s happened during a<br/>\ngiven day, bringing your personal and family stories to life, and - what I<br/>\nfound it most helpful for - dealing with and helping my child with traumas<br/>\nand fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used it with my daughter most memorably to find a way to talk about her<br/>\ndifficult feelings about acquiring a sibling, to deal with her feelings of<br/>\ntrauma when the local museum she loved changed her absolutely favorite<br/>\ndinosaur room into a train room (little did they know the effect on her!),<br/>\nwhen my husband traumatized this sensitive to sound child with the electric<br/>\nsaw one day resulting in a period of time when she refused to go beyond the<br/>\nend of the driveway outside the car for 9 months because of fear of noise,<br/>\nand when she expressed fears about getting bigger.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost recently one day she completely lost it because she realized all of a<br/>\nsudden out of the blue that all her cousins on my side of the family that<br/>\nshe plays with and her brother have blonde or light hair while she has black<br/>\nhair.  She sobbed and sobbed and screamed at me to cut all her hair off and<br/>\nmake it blonde.  Everything including just being with her silently caused<br/>\nher to escalate until I told her the story of a little unicorn who decided<br/>\nto change the color of her mane (then all her other parts) to be just like<br/>\nher friends ...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a sometime writer and have an essay on specifically how storytelling<br/>\nhelped my daughter with her fears - if anyone thinks it would be helpful to<br/>\nthem, just send me an email offlist at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:salgenovese@...\">salgenovese@...</a> and I&#39;ll<br/>\nsend it to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":138085708,"authorName":"earthmothergypsy","from":"&quot;earthmothergypsy&quot; &lt;earthmothergypsy@...&gt;","profile":"earthmothergypsy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"****!!!!!!BEAR!!!!!!**** (was that gentle enough?)  :)","postDate":"1089380615","msgId":1664,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjbTdlNytiY3ZxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1671,"prevInTime":1663,"nextInTime":1665,"topicId":1664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, I used the bear in the yard example yesterday and while my kids were out playing badmitten last evening, the bear came lumbering down the driveway like","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2087857046\">Well, I used the &quot;bear in the yard&quot; example yesterday and while my <br/>\nkids were out playing badmitten last evening, the bear came lumbering <br/>\ndown the driveway like he was coming to play along too!!!!!!
