When my ds was a  toddler <br/>\nand I was pregnant with dd, a friend and I started a local chapter of  MOMS Club <br/>\nbecause we didn&#39;t fit in with the closest other chapter.  It took  awhile to <br/>\nget going but in a few months we had enough members for several weekly  <br/>\nactivities.  Kids are welcome (well pretty much expected ) at all daytime  <br/>\nactivities and meetings.  Groups plan whatever they are interested in-  field trips, <br/>\npicnic, park days, playgroups for all ages, etc.  Also fun for  mom were other <br/>\ngroups we started like scrapbook night, mom&#39;s nite out,  etc.  Those we usually <br/>\ndid at night and had dh watch the kids, but it was a  great way to meet a <br/>\nbunch of moms with young kids and gave me and the kids built  in friends at lots <br/>\nof stuff.  And, people totally understood if you were  running late or had to <br/>\ncancel because the kids were sicks, whatever.  The  kids could play and moms <br/>\ncould play and also get a chance to chit-chat.  It  was great for me.  Then we <br/>\nmoved and I haven&#39;t had the chance to join a  moms group of any sort, but now <br/>\nthat the kids are older, I&#39;m more interested in  a homeschool group anyways.<br/>\nSome cities/ towns also have other moms group that go by a different  name.<br/>\ngood luck,<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11014,"nextTopicId":11121}}
