She had very little verbal skills tolet us know how she felt, but this necklace made it extremly clear tofamily and friends how she was feeling.

Not that it always worked,<br/>\nbut most of the time I could remove him or distract quickly....we<br/>\ntalked about the situation away from the intense emotions. He couldn&#39;t<br/>\nhandle a discussion of any kind while he was angry or lashing out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly, we tried to do things with people that understood him and<br/>\ncould let me go handle things without giving it a lot of attention.<br/>\nSpending time at certain friend&#39;s houses, or doing things in small<br/>\ngropus. We still do a lot of that but lately he handles things<br/>\namazingly well. This has been a big year for us. I&#39;ve gotten comments<br/>\nfrom people about how much he&#39;s changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmpathy and impulsiveness are just like reading or any other skill a<br/>\nperson might have (or not have) a natural ability for. Some people<br/>\ntake longer to develop it, some need cues their entire lives. Labeling<br/>\nit won&#39;t give that person better skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo beyond being proactive about our social choices, we also tried to<br/>\nkeep snacks readily available, give him a lot of time to adjust to<br/>\nwhatever activity is coming up (transitions are still huge for him)<br/>\nand keep a lot of tools for physical activity around (trampoline,<br/>\nskates etc..).<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately, I have ways to work around him being home, which he<br/>\nchooses most of the time. He prefers being here unless it&#39;s something<br/>\nreally fun. It can take some creative exploration to find ways to<br/>\nsupport everyone, but trying to keep Jalen out of situations where he<br/>\nwon&#39;t be his best is part of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Maybe OT? aggression and disagreements-parenting compassionately","postDate":"1213161575","msgId":33720,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUyRDM0RUE4LTdFQTAtNDQxNC1CMTg1LUQ5NDE1MkQ2Mzc5M0BtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxYTkwMWM4Y2I0ZiQ0ODc1YmUzMCQ2NDAxYThjMEB0ZWFjaGVyZmVyPg==","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTExMi1XNTA0NEE3NjcwRDIzRkEwQTYwN0RBMUFEQjMwQHBoeC5nYmw+IDwwMWE5MDFjOGNiNGYkNDg3NWJlMzAkNjQwMWE4YzBAdGVhY2hlcmZlcj4="},"prevInTopic":33719,"nextInTopic":33721,"prevInTime":33719,"nextInTime":33721,"topicId":33718,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

When his little brother does something to upset him he usually reacts by screaming and then hitting the 1st available &quot;safe&quot; person (usually his sister).  We constantly have issues with dirt/rock throwing, inappropriate grabbing, etc.  I am sorry to say that I do not know anything that works, however, I know a lot of things that don&#39;t.  I continually take the same stance as you do and show understanding and empathy when I explain that the things he is doing upsetting and/or dangerous to others.  He does have the capability to stop doing the activity, for how long all depends on his receptivity that day.  Some days it&#39;s only a few mins. and other times he&#39;ll just move on to some other activity that may or may not be considered better.  The best thing I can offer to help is that when I understand/remember that everything for him is in the moment and that it takes months (sometimes years) for a concept to sink into the point that he is able to access that information on his own w/o my reminding him.  This helps me not to become frustrated with his behavior, but I don&#39;t always succeed and have my bad days too.  There are some concepts that we have been &quot;working&quot; on for years that have shown no improvement/understanding, like toilet training, hitting, throwing things in anger, and getting in people&#39;s faces.  I remind myself on a constant basis that there are wonderfully beautiful things about him that I wouldn&#39;t trade for the world and that b/c he cannot get the information from one part of his brain to the other in order to not hurt people that it is my responsibility to do it for him (by gently reminding him of the things that he&#39;s forgetting).  Like your son, mine doesn&#39;t want to hurt/upset people and we have talks where he seems to understand that (for instance) he shouldn&#39;t rush right up and yell HELLO inches from someones nose, when the time comes it&#39;s like his excitment makes everything we talked about non-existent. <br/>\n<br/>\nI continue to be compassionate and understanding that he is not like other kids, he needs my help to function socially.  I have issues with this a lot of the time.  I have 3 other kids who for the most part tollerate his differences with amazing understanding.  I wish the rest of the world was so accepting!  We have a lot of run-ins with kids that either won&#39;t have anything to do with him or become aggressive, for me this is so heartbreaking.  He loves kids & he wants to play, yet, he is so inappropriate most kids won&#39;t even get past the yelling HELLO!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing, when it comes to siblings..... I have spoken to them all and I think all but the 3 yr. old understands that when Chris starts to melt (hitting, screaming, etc.) that if I ask them to leave that it&#39;s not against them and that they are not being punished it&#39;s that I/we need some space to try and get him calmed down b/c sometimes moving him escalates the meltdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hopes with unschooling him is that I can (through repetition and patience) help him to understand how to be considerate, kind, and accepting. Loving a child with differences like these is challenging and takes a considerable amount of self control.  You have my best wishes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer mom to Chrissy 19, Lacy 16, Chris 8, Amber 7, and Hayden 3<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Kelli Johnston <br/>\n  To: Unschooling Unschooling <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, June 10, 2008 3:59 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Maybe OT? aggression and disagreements-parenting compassionately<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi, I was wondering if someone could help me with some ideas on how to help my son with aggressive or disrespectful reactions to his feelings (upset and happy). I read Sandra Dodd&#39;s piece on sibling fighting and I think it is mostly what we do already. But I am thinking more in regard to other children that we may or may not know. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Two situations that come up for us is when my son will throw dirt or rocks around himself for fun but they often hurt people inadvertantly. Sometimes he thinks it is funny to get a reaction from others too so it isn&#39;t all inadvertant. I normally go to him and tell him that he should be sure to not be near others that could get hurt by his actions or to be respectful of other&#39;s wishes when playing (some kids don&#39;t like to be splashed and some do-like him :O)). He will continue to do these things though ....over and over again even after every time I speak with him about it. Sometimes if I tell him to move to another place where he can throw rocks safely he will just shout &quot;NO!&quot; and laugh.<br/>\n<br/>\n  THe other situation is when he is extremely frustrated or upset, he is reaction is to hit and scream at....every one around him. We have told him and showed him how to release his anger on his pillow or to use specific words instead but it is still an on going struggle for him. He is getting really heavy now and removing him from situations is extremely difficult (say he is hitting his sister and won&#39;t stop fighting with her....lots of times it is to get her to go away from him so removing her first seems to be unfair?)....or once he held onto another girl in the water and she went under and freaked out. It was in play and he didn&#39;t realize it was dangerous but once I said to stop and helped her out of the water he didn&#39;t seem to understand the seriousness of the situation and swam off laughing. I kept asking him to talk to me about it and he refused.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He is on the spectrum so empathy, impulse and explosiveness has always been a challenge for him (and us) but it comes in waves....and we are in a wave!. He is almost 6 years old. I do a fair amount of preparation before we do anything.....reminding him of ways to be respectful of others and not hurt others in playdate settings. He acknowledges that he understands and seems empathetic while we are talking then but it all goes out the window when we are in the situation.Thanks!- Kelli<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  No virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\n  Checked by AVG. <br/>\n  Version: 8.0.100 / Virus Database: 270.2.0/1494 - Release Date: 6/10/2008 7:22 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":238615405,"authorName":"Kelli Johnston","from":"Kelli Johnston &lt;KelliJohnston@...&gt;","profile":"kaipelesmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Maybe OT? aggression and disagreements-parenting compassionately","postDate":"1213131557","msgId":33718,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTExMi1XNTA0NEE3NjcwRDIzRkEwQTYwN0RBMUFEQjMwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33719,"prevInTime":33717,"nextInTime":33719,"topicId":33718,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I was wondering if someone could help me with some ideas on how to help my son with aggressive or disrespectful reactions to his feelings (upset and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1648002692\">Hi, I was wondering if someone could help me with some ideas on how to help my son with aggressive or disrespectful reactions to his feelings (upset and happy).
