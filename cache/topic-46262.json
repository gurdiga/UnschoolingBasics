This has been a journey deep into self and looking  <br/>\nat all the beliefs i personally have. Children are naturals at this,  <br/>\nthis is there innate state. There is nothing to defend against there  <br/>\nis nothing to make special about it, or to make any other belief  <br/>\nsystem right or wrong. It really is a journey of trust. I have come to  <br/>\nknow this has been part of my spiritual path. I think the most  <br/>\nimportant thing, is whether a child is in school, or if they are  <br/>\nnot...its about all of us following our hearts and our inner guidance  <br/>\nin whatever form that make take.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally feel that unschooling is more than unschooling.As my  <br/>\nchildren lead the way as what is natural to them, i can trust and look  <br/>\nat any all fears that arise in myself or others around me, knowing its  <br/>\nan opportunity just to look into my own mind to see what my beliefs  <br/>\nare..<br/>\n<br/>\nJust felt to share...Sandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46240,"nextTopicId":7231}}
