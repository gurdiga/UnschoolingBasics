He was so naive<br/>\nand inexperienced it&#39;s almost unbelievable he survived but it&#39;s a good<br/>\nstory. <br/>\n<br/>\n==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\nHere&#39;s another one about an inexperienced, naive young man who sets out on a <br/>\nquest to live in the wilds of Alaska: &quot;Into The Wild&quot; by Jon Krakauer. <br/>\nNonfiction. VERY interesting story (I thought) but, with a very tragic ending. I read <br/>\nit a couple years ago and my dd is reading it now. Not trying to be <br/>\ndiscouraging or anything.  It&#39;s more of a *what not to do* kind of story when <br/>\nattempting to live out in the wild. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s from a well-to-do family, gives away $25,000 in savings to charity, <br/>\nabandons his car and most of his possessions, burns all the cash in his wallet and <br/>\ngoes off to live in the wild. He was definitely not well prepared at all. At <br/>\none point he sees a plane over head and waves, with ONE hand, which is an <br/>\ninternational signal that &quot;Hello. Everything is OK.&quot; He didn&#39;t even know to wave <br/>\n*both* hands up in the air to signal distress so the plane moved on. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14071,"nextTopicId":14050}}
