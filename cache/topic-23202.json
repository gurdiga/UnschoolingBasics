I&#39;m going to a one-day intensive &quot;Bee School&quot; to learn<br/>\n&gt; to take care of my Christmas present: two beehives.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cameron said the other day, &quot;For Unschoolers, we sure are taking a lot<br/>\n&gt; of schooly classes!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That got me thinking...especially since we are one of those families<br/>\n&gt; that discovered unschooling after years and years of schooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think that there are three &quot;Stages of Unschooling.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stage I<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The first stage is the longest and most difficult and involves getting<br/>\n&gt; rid of all school-think, which includes classes and &quot;instruction&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; school-speak. We have to rid ourselves of the reliance on schools and<br/>\n&gt; teachers and testing and book-worship. We need to look deeply into the<br/>\n&gt; difference between &#39;teach&#39; and &#39;learn&#39;. We ban classes and structure<br/>\n&gt; and nagging. It&#39;s accepting that grades and requirements and diplomas<br/>\n&gt; and curricula and extrinsic motivations truly have no meaning in an<br/>\n&gt; unschooling life. It&#39;s realizing that the whole world is related and<br/>\n&gt; inter-related: it&#39;s about NOT dividing the world into subjects: math is<br/>\n&gt; science is art is history is literature is FUN! It&#39;s a time for<br/>\n&gt; reflection on how we&#39;ve learned the things that really matter in our<br/>\n&gt; adult lives. It&#39;s hard to let go of all that school-think, to go beyond<br/>\n&gt; what we&#39;ve been *taught* was important and to value ALL learning as<br/>\n&gt; important.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s realizing that we learn what WE believe is important WHEN we are<br/>\n&gt; ready. And it&#39;s realizing that what&#39;s important often changes. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; about abolishing coercion in learning and about the freedom to change<br/>\n&gt; passions. It&#39;s understanding that learning doesn&#39;t stop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Face it, almost all of you reading this in 2004 went to school---at<br/>\n&gt; least for 12 years, maybe as many as 22 or 25 years! School is so<br/>\n&gt; ingrained in us, that it&#39;s hard to think any other way. We appreciate<br/>\n&gt; &quot;straight A students&quot; and &quot;AP&quot; classes and college prep high schools<br/>\n&gt; and term papers and &quot;higher math&quot; and high SAT/ACT scores. &quot;Good&quot;<br/>\n&gt; students are given preferential treatment by everyone: pizzas for<br/>\n&gt; reading and Chuck E. Cheese tokens for good report cards. Even our<br/>\n&gt; child&#39;s car insurance is lowered if we have an &quot;A student!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stage one is about ridding our minds of those things, about really<br/>\n&gt; thinking about learning in a holistic manner. It&#39;s about examining how<br/>\n&gt; we learned what truly interests us---especially those things that<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t require a &quot;teacher.&quot; What are your passions? HOW did you learn<br/>\n&gt; to do those things? In a classroom?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Two of my passions as a child were dogs and horses. Dogs and horses are<br/>\n&gt; NOT taught in any grade, middle, or high school *I* know of. But I<br/>\n&gt; wanted to learn everything I could about them. My parents gave me dogs<br/>\n&gt; and horses. They bought me books and paid for me to take riding lessons<br/>\n&gt; and dog obedience classes. They paid for dog and horse shows and<br/>\n&gt; equipment. My passion threw me into reading every book I could find<br/>\n&gt; (there were no videos back then�or &quot;Animal Planet!&quot;). By twelve I could<br/>\n&gt; identify every breed of dog and horse that I had ever seen or read<br/>\n&gt; about and tell you how it was developed, where, why, and by whom. I<br/>\n&gt; spent every weekend and every afternoon at a dog show/horse<br/>\n&gt; show/event/trial or just hanging around the stable or kennel. I asked<br/>\n&gt; thousands of questions and &quot;got my hands dirty.&quot; Many of my friends<br/>\n&gt; were adults with the same passions. Training, breeding, grooming,<br/>\n&gt; showing, husbandry�all of these things I learned because I was consumed<br/>\n&gt; by them!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But, of course, dogs and horses are NOT school subjects�and are<br/>\n&gt; completely unimportant in the school world. What if I had waited for a<br/>\n&gt; teacher to come along and say, &quot;Today we are learning all about dog and<br/>\n&gt; horses&quot;? Not only would I have waited all my life, the teacher would<br/>\n&gt; only have given me a &quot;taste&quot; of the subject!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; OH! And you *can&#39;t* make a living with dogs and horses�right?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stage one is often referred to as DEschooling. It&#39;s the period of time<br/>\n&gt; we need to give ourselves in order to &quot;step away from the box&quot; of<br/>\n&gt; school and school-think. Ask yourself why and how you learned your<br/>\n&gt; passion: whether it was music, cooking, flying, gardening, or<br/>\n&gt; long-distance running. Or even more &quot;academic-like&quot; passions, like<br/>\n&gt; Shakespeare, chemistry, World War II, or a foreign language. When you<br/>\n&gt; are comfortable with how learning happens by indulging in passions and<br/>\n&gt; making connections in your learning, you are quickly heading towards<br/>\n&gt; stage two.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stage II<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once you are comfortable with the idea of immersion learning�and you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; over wanting or needing classes and structure, you&#39;re finally over the<br/>\n&gt; deschooling hump and are actively in the process of UNschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stage two involves really immersing ourselves�and allowing our children<br/>\n&gt; to immerse themselves�into passions and even into slight, fleeting<br/>\n&gt; interests. Seeing connections and making connections and yet realizing<br/>\n&gt; that some things *might* not connect for YEARS is the most important<br/>\n&gt; part of stage two.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Connection: I remember lying in my bed when I was about 11 or 12. My<br/>\n&gt; bed was behind the door, so that, when open, the door obscured the head<br/>\n&gt; of my bed. I had tied a string to my doorknob. I would try to shut my<br/>\n&gt; door with my finger at the point of the doorjamb; then I would open the<br/>\n&gt; door back up with a pull on the string. It took *a lot* of pressure<br/>\n&gt; (and pain!) to close my door at the point of the jamb. But every inch<br/>\n&gt; closer to the door knob I got, it would be easier and easier to close,<br/>\n&gt; so that by the time I was right at the edge of the door (by the knob),<br/>\n&gt; I could almost &quot;blow&quot; it shut. I had &quot;discovered&quot; torque�but it had no<br/>\n&gt; name!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; School&#39;s idea that children should be given the definition of torque<br/>\n&gt; and then have it explained is backwards. It was so simple for me to<br/>\n&gt; understand the definition of torque because I already had made the<br/>\n&gt; personal and meaningful connection with my bedroom door.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Passion: There are people who invest their time (and many even make a<br/>\n&gt; living) studying Elizabethan fashion or reading/writing about the works<br/>\n&gt; of John Steinbeck or determining whether an 17th century chair is a<br/>\n&gt; forgery or watching birds make nests/feed their young or , as I heard<br/>\n&gt; on the radio yesterday: there&#39;s this guy who&#39;s getting his Masters<br/>\n&gt; degree in Soil Science! Go figure!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If allowed (and often, even if not allowed!), a child will pursue his<br/>\n&gt; career by following his passion(s). A wise parent will encourage this<br/>\n&gt; pursuit of passion, because it may be what the child decides to devote<br/>\n&gt; his life&#39;s work to. Maybe *more* importantly, that wise parent will<br/>\n&gt; step aside when a passion becomes &quot;old&quot; because the parent will know<br/>\n&gt; that *some* connection has been made with this fleeting passion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From 10-12 years old, Cameron was a magician. I actually thought that<br/>\n&gt; he would become the next Lance Burton or Jeff McBride (who once<br/>\n&gt; referred to Cameron as &quot;mini-me&quot;). He was so passionate about magic, he<br/>\n&gt; would practice and perform ALL day! Insert here: &quot;If I let him, Cameron<br/>\n&gt; would sit around and do magic ALL DAY!&quot; Well, he DID! Until the day<br/>\n&gt; when he quit. I was stunned! He&#39;d lost all interest. We&#39;d put thousands<br/>\n&gt; of dollars into costumes and tricks and gimmicks and conventions and<br/>\n&gt; tapes and books and private sessions with famous magicians�and he just<br/>\n&gt; up and quit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At first I was incredulous. Then I realized it was just an intense,<br/>\n&gt; fleeting passion. We still have a huge box of magic upstairs in the<br/>\n&gt; attic. He can come back to it whenever�or not. What&#39;s important is that<br/>\n&gt; it inspired him and fed a passion and entertained him (and us and<br/>\n&gt; hundreds more). He met some truly fascinating people and made<br/>\n&gt; connections that will last a lifetime�because he had an interest, a<br/>\n&gt; passion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stage one, deschooling, is a very uncomfortable time! It&#39;s a period of<br/>\n&gt; intense questioning and of challenging yourself to think differently.<br/>\n&gt; This is difficult, but it can be done�as with all learning: when you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; ready to!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stage two may be even more uncomfortable, because you&#39;re actually<br/>\n&gt; putting the ideas into action: you&#39;re allowing the passions to take<br/>\n&gt; over and you&#39;re not pushing the three &quot;R&#39;s&quot;. You are beginning to trust<br/>\n&gt; that the child will learn, and you&#39;re respecting his choices. You&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; UNschooling! And the more you do it, the easier it gets!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stage three is freedom and joy and trust and respect and desire:<br/>\n&gt; Radical Unschooling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stage III<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The third and final stage is when we can honestly and sincerely look at<br/>\n&gt; ALL learning as equal and not hold one &quot;method&quot; or style or subject or<br/>\n&gt; means of obtaining information above another. By stage three, we live<br/>\n&gt; and breathe unschooling---it&#39;s such a part of our day-to-day living<br/>\n&gt; that we can&#39;t separate it from our lives: it&#39;s not just the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;educational&quot; part because *everything* is educational. We can apply<br/>\n&gt; unschooling principles to bedtimes and eating and video gaming and TV<br/>\n&gt; and &quot;chores.&quot; We know that our children will learn because it&#39;s what<br/>\n&gt; they were born to do; they&#39;re hard-wired to learn. Learning is how the<br/>\n&gt; human species survives and progresses and succeeds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is the stage when we can effectively and confidently start giving<br/>\n&gt; out unschooling information to the uninformed or misinformed because we<br/>\n&gt; &quot;get it.&quot; We can live our lives joyfully because we&#39;re not worried<br/>\n&gt; whether Susie will pass her algebra or whether Johnny will be able to<br/>\n&gt; get into a good college, because they WILL if they want to. We know<br/>\n&gt; that they will pursue their passions...well, passionately! And that<br/>\n&gt; each day will bring more connections and learning opportunities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is the stage when classes and instruction may eke back into our<br/>\n&gt; lives, as it recently has in our family&#39;s. We don&#39;t give more weight to<br/>\n&gt; the learning that is happening in Sociology-101 or karate or<br/>\n&gt; bee-keeping just because it&#39;s happening in a classroom situation. A<br/>\n&gt; class is just another means of pursuing our passions, making the<br/>\n&gt; connections, and receiving the information. Learning happens all the<br/>\n&gt; time in all places�*even* in a classroom!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to give the impression that acceptance of class/book<br/>\n&gt; learning automatically makes you a Radical Unschooler. Stage III cannot<br/>\n&gt; &quot;just happen&quot;: you&#39;ll have to go through Stages I and II first. For<br/>\n&gt; those of us that attended school, deschooling will always exist at a<br/>\n&gt; lower level throughout our lives. The next generation (our unschooled<br/>\n&gt; children) will not have this stage to work through: they&#39;ll be able to<br/>\n&gt; see all learning as equal and good from the get-go.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a process: getting rid of the school-think and structure, becoming<br/>\n&gt; comfortable and implementing immersion learning, and *then* accepting<br/>\n&gt; ALL learning as equally valuable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; AOL now offers free email to everyone.

And it&#39;s realizing that what&#39;s important often changes. It&#39;s <br/>\nabout abolishing coercion in learning and about the freedom to change <br/>\npassions. It&#39;s understanding that learning doesn&#39;t stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nFace it, almost all of you reading this in 2004 went to school---at <br/>\nleast for 12 years, maybe as many as 22 or 25 years! School is so <br/>\ningrained in us, that it&#39;s hard to think any other way. We appreciate <br/>\n&quot;straight A students&quot; and &quot;AP&quot; classes and college prep high schools <br/>\nand term papers and &quot;higher math&quot; and high SAT/ACT scores. &quot;Good&quot; <br/>\nstudents are given preferential treatment by everyone: pizzas for <br/>\nreading and Chuck E. Cheese tokens for good report cards. Even our <br/>\nchild&#39;s car insurance is lowered if we have an &quot;A student!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nStage one is about ridding our minds of those things, about really <br/>\nthinking about learning in a holistic manner. It&#39;s about examining how <br/>\nwe learned what truly interests us---especially those things that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t require a &quot;teacher.&quot; What are your passions? HOW did you learn <br/>\nto do those things? In a classroom?<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo of my passions as a child were dogs and horses. Dogs and horses are <br/>\nNOT taught in any grade, middle, or high school *I* know of. But I <br/>\nwanted to learn everything I could about them. My parents gave me dogs <br/>\nand horses. They bought me books and paid for me to take riding lessons <br/>\nand dog obedience classes. They paid for dog and horse shows and <br/>\nequipment. My passion threw me into reading every book I could find <br/>\n(there were no videos back then—or &quot;Animal Planet!&quot;). By twelve I could <br/>\nidentify every breed of dog and horse that I had ever seen or read <br/>\nabout and tell you how it was developed, where, why, and by whom. I <br/>\nspent every weekend and every afternoon at a dog show/horse <br/>\nshow/event/trial or just hanging around the stable or kennel. I asked <br/>\nthousands of questions and &quot;got my hands dirty.&quot; Many of my friends <br/>\nwere adults with the same passions. Training, breeding, grooming, <br/>\nshowing, husbandry—all of these things I learned because I was consumed <br/>\nby them!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, of course, dogs and horses are NOT school subjects—and are <br/>\ncompletely unimportant in the school world. What if I had waited for a <br/>\nteacher to come along and say, &quot;Today we are learning all about dog and <br/>\nhorses&quot;? Not only would I have waited all my life, the teacher would <br/>\nonly have given me a &quot;taste&quot; of the subject!<br/>\n<br/>\nOH! And you *can&#39;t* make a living with dogs and horses—right?<br/>\n<br/>\nStage one is often referred to as DEschooling. It&#39;s the period of time <br/>\nwe need to give ourselves in order to &quot;step away from the box&quot; of <br/>\nschool and school-think. Ask yourself why and how you learned your <br/>\npassion: whether it was music, cooking, flying, gardening, or <br/>\nlong-distance running. Or even more &quot;academic-like&quot; passions, like <br/>\nShakespeare, chemistry, World War II, or a foreign language. When you <br/>\nare comfortable with how learning happens by indulging in passions and <br/>\nmaking connections in your learning, you are quickly heading towards <br/>\nstage two.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStage II<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you are comfortable with the idea of immersion learning—and you&#39;re <br/>\nover wanting or needing classes and structure, you&#39;re finally over the <br/>\ndeschooling hump and are actively in the process of UNschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nStage two involves really immersing ourselves—and allowing our children <br/>\nto immerse themselves—into passions and even into slight, fleeting <br/>\ninterests. Seeing connections and making connections and yet realizing <br/>\nthat some things *might* not connect for YEARS is the most important <br/>\npart of stage two.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnection: I remember lying in my bed when I was about 11 or 12. My <br/>\nbed was behind the door, so that, when open, the door obscured the head <br/>\nof my bed. I had tied a string to my doorknob. I would try to shut my <br/>\ndoor with my finger at the point of the doorjamb; then I would open the <br/>\ndoor back up with a pull on the string. It took *a lot* of pressure <br/>\n(and pain!) to close my door at the point of the jamb. But every inch <br/>\ncloser to the door knob I got, it would be easier and easier to close, <br/>\nso that by the time I was right at the edge of the door (by the knob), <br/>\nI could almost &quot;blow&quot; it shut. I had &quot;discovered&quot; torque—but it had no <br/>\nname!<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool&#39;s idea that children should be given the definition of torque <br/>\nand then have it explained is backwards. It was so simple for me to <br/>\nunderstand the definition of torque because I already had made the <br/>\npersonal and meaningful connection with my bedroom door.<br/>\n<br/>\nPassion: There are people who invest their time (and many even make a <br/>\nliving) studying Elizabethan fashion or reading/writing about the works <br/>\nof John Steinbeck or determining whether an 17th century chair is a <br/>\nforgery or watching birds make nests/feed their young or , as I heard <br/>\non the radio yesterday: there&#39;s this guy who&#39;s getting his Masters <br/>\ndegree in Soil Science! Go figure!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf allowed (and often, even if not allowed!), a child will pursue his <br/>\ncareer by following his passion(s). A wise parent will encourage this <br/>\npursuit of passion, because it may be what the child decides to devote <br/>\nhis life&#39;s work to. Maybe *more* importantly, that wise parent will <br/>\nstep aside when a passion becomes &quot;old&quot; because the parent will know <br/>\nthat *some* connection has been made with this fleeting passion.<br/>\n<br/>\n From 10-12 years old, Cameron was a magician. I actually thought that <br/>\nhe would become the next Lance Burton or Jeff McBride (who once <br/>\nreferred to Cameron as &quot;mini-me&quot;). He was so passionate about magic, he <br/>\nwould practice and perform ALL day! Insert here: &quot;If I let him, Cameron <br/>\nwould sit around and do magic ALL DAY!&quot; Well, he DID! Until the day <br/>\nwhen he quit. I was stunned! He&#39;d lost all interest. We&#39;d put thousands <br/>\nof dollars into costumes and tricks and gimmicks and conventions and <br/>\ntapes and books and private sessions with famous magicians—and he just <br/>\nup and quit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first I was incredulous. Then I realized it was just an intense, <br/>\nfleeting passion. We still have a huge box of magic upstairs in the <br/>\nattic. He can come back to it whenever—or not. What&#39;s important is that <br/>\nit inspired him and fed a passion and entertained him (and us and <br/>\nhundreds more). He met some truly fascinating people and made <br/>\nconnections that will last a lifetime—because he had an interest, a <br/>\npassion.<br/>\n<br/>\nStage one, deschooling, is a very uncomfortable time! It&#39;s a period of <br/>\nintense questioning and of challenging yourself to think differently. <br/>\nThis is difficult, but it can be done—as with all learning: when you&#39;re <br/>\nready to!<br/>\n<br/>\nStage two may be even more uncomfortable, because you&#39;re actually <br/>\nputting the ideas into action: you&#39;re allowing the passions to take <br/>\nover and you&#39;re not pushing the three &quot;R&#39;s&quot;. You are beginning to trust <br/>\nthat the child will learn, and you&#39;re respecting his choices. You&#39;re <br/>\nUNschooling! And the more you do it, the easier it gets!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStage three is freedom and joy and trust and respect and desire: <br/>\nRadical Unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStage III<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third and final stage is when we can honestly and sincerely look at <br/>\nALL learning as equal and not hold one &quot;method&quot; or style or subject or <br/>\nmeans of obtaining information above another. By stage three, we live <br/>\nand breathe unschooling---it&#39;s such a part of our day-to-day living <br/>\nthat we can&#39;t separate it from our lives: it&#39;s not just the <br/>\n&quot;educational&quot; part because *everything* is educational. We can apply <br/>\nunschooling principles to bedtimes and eating and video gaming and TV <br/>\nand &quot;chores.&quot; We know that our children will learn because it&#39;s what <br/>\nthey were born to do; they&#39;re hard-wired to learn. Learning is how the <br/>\nhuman species survives and progresses and succeeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the stage when we can effectively and confidently start giving <br/>\nout unschooling information to the uninformed or misinformed because we <br/>\n&quot;get it.&quot; We can live our lives joyfully because we&#39;re not worried <br/>\nwhether Susie will pass her algebra or whether Johnny will be able to <br/>\nget into a good college, because they WILL if they want to. We know <br/>\nthat they will pursue their passions...well, passionately! And that <br/>\neach day will bring more connections and learning opportunities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the stage when classes and instruction may eke back into our <br/>\nlives, as it recently has in our family&#39;s. We don&#39;t give more weight to <br/>\nthe learning that is happening in Sociology-101 or karate or <br/>\nbee-keeping just because it&#39;s happening in a classroom situation. A <br/>\nclass is just another means of pursuing our passions, making the <br/>\nconnections, and receiving the information. Learning happens all the <br/>\ntime in all places—*even* in a classroom!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to give the impression that acceptance of class/book <br/>\nlearning automatically makes you a Radical Unschooler. Stage III cannot <br/>\n&quot;just happen&quot;: you&#39;ll have to go through Stages I and II first. For <br/>\nthose of us that attended school, deschooling will always exist at a <br/>\nlower level throughout our lives. The next generation (our unschooled <br/>\nchildren) will not have this stage to work through: they&#39;ll be able to <br/>\nsee all learning as equal and good from the get-go.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a process: getting rid of the school-think and structure, becoming <br/>\ncomfortable and implementing immersion learning, and *then* accepting <br/>\nALL learning as equally valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.

Rachel, 11, is in her 1st.  <br/>\nBoth were removed from public schools for social reasons: my son, for <br/>\nsafety reasons, and my daughter because she was turning into someone <br/>\nthe likes of which my family has never seen (think cruel, Queen of <br/>\nthe World).<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite being somewhat dissatisfied with it, I did a mostly <br/>\ntraditional form of hsing until February this year.  I&#39;d read and <br/>\ndismissed unschooling more times than I can count, and then one day <br/>\nit clicked - that&#39;s what my kids needed, that&#39;s what I needed.  I <br/>\nfigured deschooling was the first order of business.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the difference between deschooling and unschooling?
