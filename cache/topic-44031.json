The people accross the street were having an estate sale and my oldest wanted to go so we went.  She found an antique dresser she fell in love with and the lady took significantly less for it to sell it to my daughter for what she could afford.  Then after getting it in her room she remembered they had a bed frame and went to see about it.  To make a ling story short my 11 year old daughter bought complete new bedroom furniture bed and all plus a lamp and nicknacks ( all antiques) for 73.00.  Now she is dreaming and planning of how she will decorate her room.  Asked me to take her to thrift stores and yard sales yesterday where she picked up a few more antique nicknacks and a couple of decorating books for about 3.00.  It has all just come together in a way that I see she is learning lots but it is all stuff I would never have thought to teach her.  It will lead into sewing<br/>\n too because she is asking for curtains but when I said it might be a while before I can make them she said she wants to make them.  So much learning about something I would never have thought to teach.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu May 13th, 2010 12:14 PM CDT diana jenner wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    Unschooling is way more hard to figure out then homeschooling.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Only for the grownups ;) We&#39;re all born knowing how to be passionate about<br/>\n&gt;the world, we&#39;ve had more time to forget and need time to remember :D<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s a lot more work than homeschooling, a lot more internal examination<br/>\n&gt;(especially of our motivations), a lot more connectedness between people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Basically *unschooling* is less about how you educate your child and more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; about the way you believe they should be allowed to grow up?

She doesn t like big toys in her room and seems to prefer a handful of nice toys to a lot of stuff.  She wants a special place just for her and wants a special place to keep her treasures.<br/>\nDaughter #3-has always cried a lot.  Even now she cries often no tears just noise.  I think it may be because as the youngest of my older children she gets left out a lot and most likely needs extra attention.  She is very attached to the memory of a kitten she had a couple years ago ands says she loves it best in all the world.  I knew this but finally realized she may need another orange kitten like she s been asking for.  We are picking up an orange mama cat with 4 orange babies this afternoon.  They are 2 weeks old.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for today my oldest wants to go to a yard sale.  I think I will give her a few dollars spending money since she wont hardly ask for anything.  I may take them to the childrens museum (its small and didn t seem worth the admission prise to me but both my oldest have been asking to go.  They seem to think its amazing.  Plus we will be picking up the cat and kittens.  I also have an old toaster oven that only partly works.  I think I will put it on the table with some tools and let them know its OK if they would like to take it apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo am I beginning to get it?
