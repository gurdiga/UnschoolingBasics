I found it on happenstance.  I was looking<br/>\nfor some old books to use in an altered book project and came across a book<br/>\nof bio-and autobiographies by Time Books (one of those &quot;looks old and will<br/>\nlook cool on your bookshelf but probaby not something you would actually<br/>\nread type books).  I noticed that one was Ben Franklin and started scanning<br/>\nit.  Ended up reading the whole thing.
