It was hard to not have community support, but I kept<br/>\n&gt; doing my thing. I seperated from my husband in early 2002, and by<br/>\n&gt; the summer of 2003, I was enrolled in massage therapy school. I<br/>\n&gt; made the decision to send my son to school. Fortunately, it didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; work out. I say fortunately because I am glad he didn&#39;t become one<br/>\n&gt; of those children who just quietly slipped through the cracks. I<br/>\n&gt; listened to his needs and in time realized if I didn&#39;t take a break<br/>\n&gt; from school, I&#39;d lose my son to the proverbial cracks in the public<br/>\n&gt; school system. With the help of my sister, we managed to keep him<br/>\n&gt; in constant care between us, while I finished up massage therapy<br/>\n&gt; school. It was not easy, it was in fact, the most difficult thing I<br/>\n&gt; have done. Not the coursework, but the lose of family time, and the<br/>\n&gt; inability to focus on my childs homeschooling and my schooling at<br/>\n&gt; the same time. I finished as fast as I could. Meanwhile, I never<br/>\n&gt; sent him back to school after Christmas. My sister kept him busy,<br/>\n&gt; deschooled him for 3 weeks, then I was finished with the main part<br/>\n&gt; of my school. The rest of came in bits and chunks, when my parents<br/>\n&gt; cared for the kids while I did massages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I felt the overwhelming pressure to send all three kids to school in<br/>\n&gt; 2005, when I was going through the divorce.

My kids began to tell me how much they wanted to be at<br/>\n&gt; home, to unschool, to read all day if they wanted, and to make some<br/>\n&gt; decisions, if not all decisions in their education. I didn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; faith it would happen, but I spent the summer planning what we would<br/>\n&gt; do, how we would do it, and the kids even wrote stories about it. I<br/>\n&gt; was so touched that I began to look for ways (as a single mother<br/>\n&gt; with very little income) to help their wishes come true. I was<br/>\n&gt; going against everything everyone in my family believed in.<br/>\n&gt; Everyone thought I should be in a job, getting health benefits, with<br/>\n&gt; the children in school. When time to enroll the children in school<br/>\n&gt; came, I just couldn&#39;t do it. I called the school to see if I could<br/>\n&gt; enroll them after school started.
