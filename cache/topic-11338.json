We bought it<br/>\noff eBay. The author is Larry Gonick and he also writes a number of<br/>\nothers including a history of the universe. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted to respond to the woman who says she isn&#39;t comfortable<br/>\nwith unschooling yet because of her fear of her families reaction. I<br/>\ncan totally relate. However, our &quot;schooling&quot; process has led us to<br/>\nunschooling mostly and the family is freaked out! I can tell you from<br/>\nwhat I am going though now, the schooling issues have brought up a<br/>\nwhole lot of family and past issues which have needed to come to the<br/>\nsurface for a loooong time. In the end the issue doesn&#39;t seem to be<br/>\nabout schooling at all. It has wound up being about how my parents<br/>\nstill see me as a child, treat me as such(even at 36) and will not<br/>\nrespect or trust our decision. I just sent off a letter to my dad<br/>\ntoday responding to his accusations that we are ruining our childrens&#39;<br/>\nlives. Boygolly isn&#39;t this fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, when I put that aside and keep what is important in front of<br/>\nme (our children and their well being) the decision we made was worth<br/>\nevery consequence (consequence being the flack from my family and the<br/>\npast wounds being revisited). Our children are exceptional people (as<br/>\nI am sure every one of your children are) and we learn more from them<br/>\nthan I think they from us. What do I learn from our children? I am<br/>\nlearning to trust the universe again. To see things with simple eyes.<br/>\nTo watch the magic that occurs in a single dandilion and then multiply<br/>\nthat by everything. You all know what I am talking about. They<br/>\nmysteries od life that most often only children notice because adults<br/>\nare so closed down and afraid. Since my children I have made friends<br/>\nwith the snails again who crawl on our front porch late at night. I am<br/>\nthe snail police, making sure each of them reach their destination<br/>\nwithout getting crunched. This is a lovely responsibility. And only<br/>\none example of some of my own awakenings. How can I not trust that my<br/>\nchildren, who are wiser in most respects can&#39;t lead themselves (and<br/>\nme) to learn what they need. It is inate within them. They cannot help<br/>\nbut explore and learn. I am sorry if I am rambling, but I am so very<br/>\npassionate about all of this that given the opportunity I will share<br/>\nshare share. I fell it s simply my responsibilty to put in front of<br/>\nthem as many resources as possible. That is my job, oh yes, and to get<br/>\nout of the way. I wish my own parents could do the same. <br/>\n<br/>\nI loved what someone else wrote about how the only people we have to<br/>\nanswer to about our children&#39;s education is our children. (applause!)<br/>\nI will keep this in mind and use it as my latest mantra!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the video of the jcb kid who&#39;s dad is &quot;Bruce Lee&#39; was incredible<br/>\nand I most certainly cried the second time we watched it for the<br/>\ndeclaration of how happy he is not to be in schoool was so very<br/>\ntouching! Thank you so much! Finally, does anyone know anything about<br/>\nanimation for our kids want to create an animated little movie. Can we<br/>\nget direction to some sites or books on the subject that yo umight<br/>\nknow about? Thanks everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the very best to all of you and thank you for the opportunity to<br/>\nshare!!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11302,"nextTopicId":11332}}
