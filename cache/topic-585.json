Older 2 went  through the <br/>\npublic school system, unfortunately, I didn&#39;t realize the  options!<br/>\n <br/>\nYounger 3 started in public, withdrawn and homeschooled.   They calmly and <br/>\nquickly led me to unschooling and here we are - reveling in  it!  Hayden is 12, <br/>\nLogan is 10 and Holly is 8.<br/>\n <br/>\nDh, Marty, and I have always hung with the kids too.  It seemed almost  <br/>\nunnatural to us not to.  But it got me to start thinking about my own  upbringing.  <br/>\nAnd while it was far, far, far from perfect, my parents did  make it a point <br/>\nof never going anywhere without us.<br/>\n <br/>\nEverything we plan or do is done so with all of us in mind.  Some of  us like <br/>\ngetting out of the house more than others and we do our best to  accommodate.<br/>\n <br/>\nWithout knowing it had a term, we have always been gentle parenters.   Maybe <br/>\nit&#39;s easier when you raise them that way from birth rather than transition  <br/>\nlater on.  We&#39;ve just never had any real &quot;issues.&quot;  We model self  respect and <br/>\nrespect for others and are living a life so joyful it should be  illegal &lt;bwg&gt;.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s us.  It&#39;s nice to be here.<br/>\n <br/>\nLinda in Ann Arbor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":558,"nextTopicId":531}}
