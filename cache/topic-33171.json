I think it may <br/>\nstill be too cold for slide rock but anywhere along the river will be <br/>\nnice for hiking around. My son is also a gamer but loves to go to the <br/>\ntrout farm and fish. It can get pricey, you have to pay for the fish <br/>\nyou catch and can&#39;t catch and release, but its a blast for the kids <br/>\nand exciting as you can see them. There is also Page Springs Hatchery <br/>\nwhich is neat to visit. Take a drive up the canyon toward Flag and <br/>\nyou can stop along the river and hike down along it, that&#39;s always <br/>\nnice. My homeschooling (mostly unschooling) group meets at Sunset <br/>\nParker on Thursdays starting at 11:00. Kids are ages 5 up to 13. Its <br/>\ncasual and fun. Turn east at the Walgreens on Sunset and go just a <br/>\nlittle ways, you&#39;ll see the park on your right.
