We were there a lot when our son was born, even before <br/>\nthe unschooling.  Everything we did, compared to both our families, <br/>\nwas &quot;weird&quot; and had to be constantly defended.  We didn&#39;t circumcise, <br/>\ndidn&#39;t vax.  Breastfeeding alone sent our respective families into <br/>\nfits.  They just couldn&#39;t get it.  The fact that our son was still <br/>\nbreastfeeding at 4 was way too much for them to understand!  We all <br/>\nslept together in a family bed.  We just didn&#39;t do anything the <br/>\nway &quot;normal&quot; people did.  So the negative feedback from everyone <br/>\naround us was constant, relentless, and really quite annoying.  When <br/>\nwe would go over to my wife&#39;s family with our nine month old son and <br/>\nspend a few minutes showing them the signs the boy made and <br/>\nrecognized so they could &quot;talk&quot; to them, they looked at us as if we <br/>\nwere crazy - until he started signing at them!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not good at listening to people comment on my decisions.  I have <br/>\na tendency to tell people where to stuff it, but I was trying to be <br/>\nmore gentle with my family and my wife&#39;s family.  I tried to explain <br/>\neverytime someone would ask about one or another of our decisions.  <br/>\nBut it quickly became apparent that the person asking the question <br/>\n(Why do you breastfeed?) wasn&#39;t really interested in hearing our <br/>\nresponse or in learning something new, they just wanted to get the <br/>\nconversation started so they could attack with their pre-<br/>\narranged &quot;brilliant&quot; comeback (You know, that will cause him to end <br/>\nup gay.)  Ok, so I don&#39;t have the most progressive family in the <br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, given that we were surrounded by people who disagreed with so <br/>\nmany of our choices, and who had such poor manners that they didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow that constantly poking us on it was rude, we had to spend a lot <br/>\nof time being defensive.  In a case, for example, where you&#39;re still <br/>\nnursing a three year old, it isn&#39;t enough simply to not care what <br/>\neveryone thinks - you have to go on the offense as well.  My three <br/>\nyear old son could understand when people made negative remarks about <br/>\nus, our decisions, our practices, etc and my wife and I would just <br/>\nnow allow it.  I was not about to have someone make my son self-<br/>\nconscious about the fact that he nursed, so snarky comments when my <br/>\nchildren were present would result in an immediate rebuke from me <br/>\n(with my family) or my wife (with hers).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, long story short, eventually they all got over their <br/>\nsqueamishness when they saw that 1) our kids refused to succumb to <br/>\nall of the horrible things they were sure would happen because of our <br/>\nchoices and 2) either my wife or I would tell them where to stuff it!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now (eight years and three kids later) nobody says much and we <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to spend so much mental energy feeling defensive and <br/>\nplanning how we&#39;ll handle it when nutty Uncle X says something <br/>\noffensive at Thanksgiving dinner.  Although, when our son was born <br/>\nthree weeks ago, I could feel them wanting to say something about the <br/>\nfact that we did a lotus birth!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":232014518,"authorName":"Wendy McDonald","from":"Wendy McDonald &lt;iwendyiwanda@...&gt;","profile":"iwendyiwanda","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:i feel somethings wrong here...","postDate":"1212592494","msgId":33486,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczOUM0OTg3LTRFRDUtNDk5Ni04OERELTYzNTRBMjAwN0MwRUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":33482,"nextInTopic":33550,"prevInTime":33485,"nextInTime":33487,"topicId":33377,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It sounds like your dh needs to do some growing.
