She is deschooling, for sure!!  Deschooling means she is decompressing from the expectations that school or a school-at-home approach laid on her.  She is being given the room and time to figure out for HERSELF what her interests are.  She will need YOU to be patient and support her.  Have you discovered your own passions and interests and does she see you trying them out in front of her?  Try doing the things you strewed about yourself, showing her they can be interesting things to do.  This must be, however, without the expectation that she will automatically become interested in these things and want to do them immediately.  She may actually still be intensely interested in her own &quot;work&quot; right now, which may be lots of tv, lots of figuring out what to do with her day.  That is quite a challenge for someone who has had her day planned for her by other adults!  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The other thing is that you must, must, must get the idea out of your head that some things are &quot;productive&quot; and &quot;mindless&quot; and others are not.  EVERYTHING is a learning experience for humans.  She is getting something out of everything she is doing, whether that is being bored for a bit, watching an entertaining show, reading a book, painting, etc.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, don&#39;t beat yourself up (or your daughter!) about being in the schooly mindset!

Take baby steps.  And talk with her about this!  Ask her how she&#39;s enjoying her show, if there&#39;s anything she needs or would like to explore.

I first heard about unschooling from a family that was giving it up as a failure - they&#39;d done something closer to what I&#39;d call &quot;unparenting&quot;, but at the time all I knew was that &quot;unschooling&quot; was a disaster. Over the next few years I met a few starry-eyed mothers with infants who extolled the virtues of radical unschooling, and two other families who made unschooling look like a nightmare. So I was verrrrrry leary of unschooling. I took baby steps. Some of my baby steps involved learning to honor Ray&#39;s needs, and I&#39;m glad I took them! They helped enormously, even if we were still a long way from radical unschooling at that point. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am not here to support your toying around with mindless and unproductive ideas while FOUR YEARS of a little girl&#39;s life goes by in school, with a mom playing games online and whining.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nEr...I think I missed something.

He loves many varieties, and most of his learning comes through the filter of games or TV.  He learns so much from figuring out the strategy of shooting games, working through a series of riddles with Carmen Sandiego, playing Pokemon or Spectrobes on his DS, and the list goes on and on.

She learned a lot about biology, geography, geology, meteorology, and music.  Then we got her some out-of-print books on Ebay with the same hero, where she learned an immense amount of sophisticated vocabulary, more geology, some bits of history and culture, mapreading, more music, art, and to read and write several words she found irresistible.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one point, she choreographed a dance for the end credits, and made a chart to show her brother the steps.  She spent an hour in intense activity of a very complex nature.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut these bursts of understanding and growth come after many hours of what looks just like stiing and staring at a screen, oblivious to the rest of the world...<br/>\n<br/>\nStill waters DO run deep.

She is being given the room and time to figure out for HERSELF what her interests are.  She will need YOU to be patient and support her.  Have you discovered your own passions and interests and does she see you trying them out in front of her?  Try doing the things you strewed about yourself, showing her they can be interesting things to do.  This must be, however, without the expectation that she will automatically become interested in these things and want to do them immediately.  She may actually still be intensely interested in her own &quot;work&quot; right now, which may be lots of tv, lots of figuring out what to do with her day.

The official unschooling experts&#39; recommendation for deschooling is &quot;live as if you were on vacation.&quot; This is an important part of the healing process for your dd and yourself. She needs time to change gears. YOU need time to learn about learning, because natural learning doesn&#39;t look like schoolish learning. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; So far since ditching the traditional way of schooling, she has been passing her days by watching T.V.

Offer to play with her? You might need some practice (re)learning to play! Offer to do some fun things with her for the sake of fun itself - like, make fudge and eat it while watching a goofy movie marathon! That level of enjoyment can help the two of you reconnect, something that&#39;s important emotionally And in terms of you beginning to understand how she really learns and thinks, so that you can help her on her journey. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;...talking to herself in pretend scenarios waiting patiently...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is an important kind of play, btw. Its a powerful natural learning tool. Play with her! Or simply hang out with her and listen/watch as her interests unfold.

Some kids can come home and still feel pressured by past expectations to do things that look like school. Its great that she instinctively is staying away from those things for now. Depending on how she best learns, she may never get into things that &quot;look&quot; educational, but that doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s not learning and won&#39;t have any skills. She&#39;s just going to have a chance to find out how she Really learns sooner. That&#39;s marvelous. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy always-unschooled 8yo does a few things that look very &quot;academic&quot;. She likes to play with the microscope and calculator, does some math games and puzzles, she likes non-fiction, and even some textbooks. Those things are easy for me to point to when family and neighbors wonder what we do &quot;for school&quot;. Most of her learning, though, looks like play: legos and video games and hours a day cutting things out of paper, mostly with the tv on. There&#39;s a loooooot going on in that paper cutting, but its would be easy to overlook that if I was expecting all her &quot;learning&quot; to look like her math games. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 16yo doesn&#39;t do much that looks schoolish. As he&#39;s getting older, more of what he does looks &quot;vocational&quot; - woodworking, welding, that sort of thing, but for the most part he doesn&#39;t learn through books and classes. He learns by hanging out with guys with the skills and knowledge he wants to explore. So I &quot;point&quot; to the woodworking, but most of his learning looks like standing around a kitchen chit chatting, or sitting on a rock yacking, or leaning on a truck, bein&#39; a guy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am so &quot;white knuckling&quot; this whole unschooling concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What&#39;s the scariest part? For me, it was the idea that there was just me &quot;to blame&quot; I guess you could say. I had the power to screw it all up. But kids are Amazing! They really are. Watching my kids learn from everything around them, not just me but from tv and each other, from the cats and the sky and books and music and the neighbors and random people we&#39;d meet in town, that did a lot to bring me down to earth. The only way I cas screw it All up is by being always in the way! <br/>\n<br/>\nHang out with your dd and learn to see her amazingness. Neither you nor she will ever regret that.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":219295063,"authorName":"ackerman_laura","from":"&quot;ackerman_laura&quot; &lt;ackerman_laura@...&gt;","profile":"ackerman_laura","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: New unschooler here again....","postDate":"1261418907","msgId":42507,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhnb2Rpcis1bXNlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhENDQzNDREMkI3QTRBNjg5RDIwMUY1OUY0MzVDODY2QFJvY2tldFNhdWNlMj4="},"prevInTopic":42506,"nextInTopic":42510,"prevInTime":42506,"nextInTime":42508,"topicId":42500,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Jenna and Melissa....those were helpful and positive responses.
