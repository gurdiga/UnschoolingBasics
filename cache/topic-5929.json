(small noisy hawks.) She <br/>\nhas crows also, we have a family of them that have eaten all my strawberries, <br/>\nand they hang out to clean up any oats my horses miss. <br/>\nWe go to a park down the road, on the mighty Nechako River, and we see the <br/>\ncoolest birds there. A pair of ospreys has taken up residence this year, and one <br/>\nday ds Tommy (9) was sitting in theriver, and one of the ospreys dove into <br/>\nthe river not 15 feet in front of him, and came up with a huge fish and flew <br/>\noff!!!!! We thought he would  hit Tommy&#39;s head from where we were sitting. IT was <br/>\nmost exciting. We see these birds every day now. There are also kingfishers, <br/>\nand mergansers, and the other night a pair of blue herons flew right over <br/>\nus,and landed at the top of a giant cottonwood tree right above us and watched us <br/>\nfor a while before taking off. The next night we saw them with a young&#39;un. <br/>\nSo great that you got lots of good ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nI will continue to lurk. <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy in BC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5925,"nextTopicId":5950}}
