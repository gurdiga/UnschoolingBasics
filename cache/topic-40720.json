And please spread the word.<br/>\nLove, Helene, lurking and learning on some groups, more known on others ;-)<br/>\n----<br/>\n      Welcome to sign our petition <br/>\n      The Swedish Government is trying to pull the rug from underneath the few already hard pressed home-educating families in Sweden, in their proposal for a new School Law. <br/>\n<br/>\n      We will not sit still and passively watch while our kids are forced (!) to school, after so many years in what they love: To learn in their own pace, in a safe environment, and to develop without social limitations. <br/>\n<br/>\n      A legal and very successful alternative to school is about to be erased, without any grounds or research! <br/>\n<br/>\n      For this reason, we ask you to join in supporting our work - sign the petition! <br/>\n<br/>\n      Please note: You will need to validate your signature in an email you will receive shortly after signing. This email contains a link for yoiu to click on. Only after you have clicked on the link, your signature will count. <br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40693,"nextTopicId":40688}}
