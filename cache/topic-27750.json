I have been down with a flu bug these last few days so I am just logging on again reading some wonderful messages.  To answer some questions.  Brian is a writer and has always been at home.  He did the at home dad thing when the kids were small then enjoyed some writing time when they started school now he finds he is at home again with the kids and is trying to figure out how to write and hasn&#39;t figured it out yet.  Kora is 10 and Lukas is 9.  I read about Cameron and his experience has echoed our 6 month experience.  Sort of feeling like we are failing at unschooling.....the old schooling language I know......but it is a real feeling.  It helps to know that other parents have felt the same worries....where it seems kids have no interests, they stay away from so many activities they used to do.  Brian offers a number of ways to engage in learning but they turn the other way.  However, since I wrote about our<br/>\n discouragement, we have let go a little more and see some signs of good things.  Mostly, I see happy, calm and thoughtful children emerging.  When schooled friends come over they are able to engage in lots of creative play while their friends decompress from their day by running wild and excluding each other.  Kora and Lukas seem so far from this now.  I also hear such independence from them...stating clearly what they want to do and what they don&#39;t want to do.  I see them expressing feelings more openly.  Perhaps all the work they are doing and we are doing is more the inner work the things we can&#39;t see.  I better stop here...but thanks for responses and encouragement.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Donna and Brian<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n          <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cameron Parham &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:acsp2205@...\">acsp2205@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Looking for..encouragement with process towards unschooling...it&#39;s <br/>\nbeen almost<br/>\n6 months now.&quot;<br/>\nThis caught my eye because I noted some similar feelings starting at <br/>\nabout 6<br/>\nmonths, and many still continue here at our 8-month mark.

One suggestion would be rather than him<br/>\nsuggesting is for him to (a) get involved in what the kids are doing<br/>\n(even if it&#39;s just sitting and reading a magazine and admiring artworks<br/>\nwhen presented with them) (b) get his own life - what does he love to<br/>\ndo? Woodworking? Carpentry? Gardening? Oil painting? My hubby plays<br/>\nvideogames (with or without DS, who is 9), cooks awesome meals (most<br/>\neverything we eat is from scratch and he&#39;s looking into canning foods<br/>\nnext year and grinding our own flour and nut butters), took a community<br/>\ncollege class in computer game design just for fun, and is currently<br/>\nvery into making wallets and tote bags and such from duct tape (with an<br/>\neye toward selling the items he makes at a town craft fair next July<br/>\n4th). He and DS also have spent time exploring local nature trails over<br/>\nthe last 6 months or so. Sometimes they just pack a lunch and go watch<br/>\nairplanes at the major airport 25 minutes from here. BUT the key thing<br/>\nis to just go with the flow, not take &quot;no thanks&quot; personally but just as<br/>\na statement of fact - right now, that is not what they want to do. What<br/>\ndoes he do to refill his own tank? <br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, how does he feel about being the at home dad? Is this something he<br/>\nchose? Or, is it something that is a &#39;default&#39; because he got laid off?<br/>\nKWIM? If it&#39;s a default thing, he may still be dealing with issues<br/>\nrelated to self image - particularly if he grew up with &quot;Dad works, Mom<br/>\nstays home, the man is the breadwinner&quot; type paradigm. We&#39;re fortunate<br/>\nin that DH&#39;s growing up years developed a very pragmatic streak in him -<br/>\nwhatever works, works. <br/>\n <br/>\nY&#39;all can contact me offline and I&#39;ll see if DH wants to hook up via<br/>\nemail. Also, there is a dad&#39;s group around but I&#39;m not sure how active<br/>\nit is.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

Its bee almost<br/>\n6 months now.  Sometimes everything seems to be going<br/>\nalong just fine......my husband is home with Kora and<br/>\nLukas all day and I go out to work.  We seem to be<br/>\nmoving along in our adjustment from schooling lives to<br/>\nthe unschooling life but then everything seems to<br/>\ncrumble.  My husband feels so overwhelmed with the<br/>\nwhole thing some days.  Feels like he keeps offering<br/>\nactivities to do and is met often with what he<br/>\ninterprets as a lack of interest.  Last night he said<br/>\nhe was not sure if this is working and maybe he isn&#39;t<br/>\ncut out to be an unschooling dad.  I suggested<br/>\nconnecting to other dads who unschool.
