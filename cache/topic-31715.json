Last fall we made pumpkin butter - simmer cut up pumpkin, mush it all up, add sweetener and cinnamon/spices, then slow simmer (LOW heat to avoid burning)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-659118250\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;Have you ever made apple butter?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Last fall we made pumpkin butter - simmer cut up pumpkin, mush it all<br/>\nup, add sweetener and cinnamon/spices, then slow simmer (LOW heat to<br/>\navoid burning) until it gets thick. And, again, we just jarred it and<br/>\npopped it in the fridge (let it cool just enough so the jars don&#39;t crack<br/>\nfrom the temperature difference). DS loves it on pancakes, fresh bread,<br/>\netc. (just had some last weekend and it was still good) Oh, and it&#39;s a<br/>\nshortcut to &quot;pumpkin pie&quot; - schmear some pumpkin butter on a graham<br/>\ncracker and top with whipped topping (if you like) and voila -<br/>\nindividual pumpkin pie with way less work! <br/>\n<br/>\nAh - just noticed something - we do some in glass jars and pop them in<br/>\nthe fridge as noted BUT we also use small plastic &quot;freezer jam&quot; jars and<br/>\nfreeze some of the result (jam, pumpkin butter, etc - NOT applesauce) so<br/>\nthat we have a supply for the year. DS loves the fact that we can pick<br/>\nand jam enough &quot;wild berries&quot; (wild blackberries in our back yard) to<br/>\nhave jam until the next year&#39;s berries are ripe. Berry season is one of<br/>\nhis favorites (comes right after his birthday too which is an added<br/>\nbonus) - he&#39;s usually up with the sun, dressed, and outside with a berry<br/>\ncontainer to get that day&#39;s berries. He&#39;s careful to only pick the ones<br/>\nthat are exactly ripe that day - he lets the rest continue to ripen, no<br/>\nwholesale ripping berries off the vines/canes. And, we have a deal with<br/>\nall our little woodland friends and the birds - we only pick the fronts<br/>\nand a bit of the top and side, the areas facing our lawn and readily<br/>\naccessible; they get the back, some of the top, and the underneath<br/>\nareas. It&#39;s better for everyone - we&#39;ve got 2 or 3 times the number of<br/>\nberry brambles now that we did when we first moved in because we let the<br/>\nbirds and critters have at it and they spread the seeds on their own.<br/>\nNow we all have more. That&#39;s a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, note that the pop&#39;em in the fridge thing requires that they stay<br/>\nin the fridge. It is not a substitute for water bath or pressure canning<br/>\nwhere you can shelve the results without refrigeration. That&#39;s our next<br/>\n&#39;phase&#39; that we&#39;re going to try this summer - water bath canning for<br/>\nstuff like tomatoes and tomato sauce, peaches, pears, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
