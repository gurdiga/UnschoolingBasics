Thanks for being <br/>\nhere, and I am sure I will gain alot of info and inspiration from <br/>\nyou.<br/>\nI wanted to comment on the Time Out issue, and in discipline in <br/>\ngeneral, if you don&#39;t mind.  I have been thinking so much about this <br/>\nlately.  I have a 7 yrold and almost 3 yrold...boys.  I have tried <br/>\nevery method of discipline on the market.  (yes, sadly, I have paid <br/>\nmoney for people to tell me how to count from 1 to 3...pathetic, I <br/>\nknow)  The one thing that DH and I were talking about today is the <br/>\nfact that WHEN they are misbehaving is generally when we are not <br/>\navailable to them emotionally...we might be on the computer, or <br/>\nreading the paper, or on the telephone. or just plain not paying <br/>\nattention to them. We talked about our attachment parenting...how we <br/>\nlet it slack off, and the theory being that if our kids are being <br/>\nout of control and having problems, then WE are at fault for what I <br/>\ncall &quot;Lazy Parenting&quot;  or as our parents used to say &quot;Knock it off <br/>\nand go find something to do&quot;.<br/>\nWe (DH and I) have to constantly guard ourselves against this kind <br/>\nof thinking, becuase, we chose to have these wonderful beings in our <br/>\nlives, and now..yes...here they are.  Sometimes they interfere with <br/>\nwhat WE want, but tough.  Truthfully, when we are attentive to their <br/>\nneeds, and give them all that they need, we are able to have that <br/>\nextra time to ourselves.  It is about trying to anticipate their <br/>\nneeds first and trying to meet them, before you reach a crisis, <br/>\nwhere everyone is upset.  This is true in all relationships if you <br/>\nreally think about it.  If I ignore my husband for days on end, he <br/>\nis bound to act like a jerk.  Same goes for your best friend, your <br/>\nother loved ones, and your children.<br/>\nOK.  writing this helped me probably more than anything.

Instead of the often punitive <br/>\ntone of &quot;time outs&quot; we call it &quot;taking a break&quot;. When things are getting a little intense and <br/>\nwe can&#39;t diffuse it in the scene, I ask if it would help to take a break. Then I see if he needs <br/>\nsome time to himself or if he wants me to be with him. (I still do this with our 6yo, and <br/>\nmyself at times...)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older son was always the one who wanted to be with me through his break. We&#39;d just <br/>\ntuck in and do something quiet. Play-doh, playing with water (even a bath sometimes), <br/>\nreading were things that really seemed helpful. I&#39;ve heard of other people having a little <br/>\nspot for this kind of safe, quiet space with things that help calm--like containers of soft <br/>\nmaterials (silks, velvets) and items (cotton balls,  clay, whatever they found to be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger son is more the type that needs his space. He usually chooses to be alone, but <br/>\nwith me not far from him. Yesterday, he wanted me to stay in the room and &quot;watch&quot; him, <br/>\nwhich I read to mean he wanted silent company. (Sometimes I try to be too helpful and use <br/>\ntoo many words...)<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce they reach balance again, it seems like they can be more receptive (and I can be <br/>\nmore patient and creative and positive). And that&#39;s when the gentle hands reminder has <br/>\nmore effect. And we can practice soft touch and talk about safety. And also about other <br/>\nways/words to use when he does need attention or something he&#39;s not getting. Take a <br/>\ndeep breath, it takes lots of repitition. They need to know they are safe and cared for and <br/>\nwill test that many times each day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the post...it&#39;s always great to revisit these topics with fresh eyes,<br/>\nWen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle Leifur Reid","from":"&quot;Michelle Leifur Reid&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Alternative ideas then TimeOuts!!","postDate":"1159307980","msgId":17614,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA5MjYxNDU5cjU5YzA3MThleDQ3NGNmYzk3MGJjMGUzMGVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVmYzFjNCt0YWtkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVmYzFjNCt0YWtkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17613,"nextInTopic":17615,"prevInTime":17613,"nextInTime":17615,"topicId":17612,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
