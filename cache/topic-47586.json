I know a young man, have known him since he was a teenager. His passion is cartooning (and he&#39;s really GOOD!). He took a &#39;day job&#39; working nights (LOL) at a mini-mart/convenience store because that fit with his night owl preferences, it was generally quiet which gave him lots of time to think and sketch, and it funded his purchases of art supplies and trips to comic conventions. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.toddbot.com/\">http://www.toddbot.com/</a> is his website - he is now making a living in art/comics/cartooning but there have been times along the way when he had a &#39;day job&#39; to pay the rent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think that is also the reason people put their kids in school because they think there are certain steps everyone has to take to be &quot;successful&quot;.

I have a slightly different perspective, which is that what one loves, is passionate about, doesn&#39;t always pay, and that&#39;s not a bad thing. Parenting doesn&#39;t pay very well, for instance. And there&#39;s baggage around that - it gets framed as a &quot;lesser&quot; occupation despite the fact that competent parenting takes a good bit of thought and effort. And its something to be passionate about. <br/>\n<br/>\nArt doesn&#39;t always pay, either, and its a big source of passion for many people. Making money off artwork depends on market forces and some degree of business sense - things which can get in the way of doing what one loves. That&#39;s why a lot of artists have &quot;day jobs&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there&#39;s volunteer work - some of which can be paid work in the right field but it doesn&#39;t have to be and in some cases loses in value when it moves into the realm of paid labor. Keeping unschooling information free and readily available, for example, takes the time and energy of people who are passionate about sharing that information. It&#39;s not a Bad thing to get money for writing and public speaking and even working as a homeschool consultant, but there&#39;s a particular value to keeping some resources available at no cost to those who need them. <br/>\n<br/>\nParenting and art and charity work tend to get painted as &quot;leisure&quot; activities (snort) but they&#39;re active passions for a lot of people. It&#39;s not a terrible thing to have a day-job which isn&#39;t a source of passion or personal fulfillment in order to make one&#39;s other interests attainable. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":262970381,"authorName":"brandi yates","from":"brandi yates &lt;brandi.yates@...&gt;","profile":"brandi_y_28","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: New with a question :)","postDate":"1319208976","msgId":47594,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUHpaPVZtYV9ibjdIdkt5X2tGZVZvd1FFVS1qMEFHK1p1WFRZUmNtQmNHZWFUYUZqQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEE2MDREOUJDRjA0MEI0NDA5MjMxQzkyOTg0N0RERUU4MEFEQTkxQURAVU5JQkxBQi5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PEE2MDREOUJDRjA0MEI0NDA5MjMxQzkyOTg0N0RERUU4MEFEQTkxQURAVU5JQkxBQi5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47590,"nextInTopic":47595,"prevInTime":47593,"nextInTime":47595,"topicId":47586,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks :)  This really is sort of my own problem one that I have.

Besides graphics arts/design? Besides the entire entertainment industry (music, movies, etc)? How exactly would he know what he would enjoy as a career at this point in his life? Why should he narrow things down to ONE way to make money? He IS studying something on his own right now - are you seeing that? He may even end up in a career in physics or architecture or landscape design or construction - all those things are part of Minecraft (I know, because I&#39;ve got a 13 yr old Minecrafter at home). For that matter, maybe HE&#39;LL be an at home parent while his partner works for money - my DH has been the at home parent since DS was not quite 2. At the same time, my DH has a craft business (making and selling beautiful and useful duct tape items like tote bags and wallets) AND a brand new business as a Pampered Chef consultant (because he LOVES to cook and share that love with other people). He&#39;s making money at TWO things he enjoys without ever having &quot;studied&quot; for either one and neither is something his parents would have said &quot;go study this&quot; to. He also got out of school HATING school, didn&#39;t go on to college. Worked for a decade. Started in a mailroom job at one company, ended up doing software phone support at another and then doing support, testing, and website design at a third (back in the day when website design was all hand-coded HTML which he taught himself). THEN, at age 27, two years after we got married, he CHOSE to attend a university because he found something he was passionate about and the university had all the resources to pursue that in one convenient location. So now he has a bachelor&#39;s degree and he&#39;s an at home parent and he has TWO money making businesses and he gets to use what he learned in university when and how he chooses without all the day to day stuff that would go with a full time career in that area.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now, why is it exactly that you want him to pick something to &#39;study&#39; now?<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
