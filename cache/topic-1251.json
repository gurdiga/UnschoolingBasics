Go read some of the articles at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com\">http://www.sandradodd.com</a> (click on unschooling - although I really<br/>\nlike all of her website! :-)  )<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; NO Go. She is unmotivated to do anything, nothing at all. She will<br/>\n&gt; stay on a computer from sun up too sun down and that&#39;s it. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have a problem with the computer. She may learn something that way.<br/>\n&gt; However she will not share with me what she is doing so I can record<br/>\n&gt; what she learns.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, if you are truly interested you can go to your computer&#39;s web<br/>\nbrowser and click on the History button.  On IE it&#39;s a small clock<br/>\nicon up above the navigation bar.  But she IS motivated to do<br/>\nsomething and that is computer.  Fine.  Let her have her computer.<br/>\nAnd in all honesty most kids aren&#39;t interested in &quot;innapropriate<br/>\nwebsites&quot; anyway and usually happen on them when they mistype a URL<br/>\n(Be careful when typing &quot;disney&quot; we&#39;ve run into some pretty, um,<br/>\ninteresting websites that way!)  LOL!!  Until she can trust that you<br/>\naren&#39;t going to force anything she is interested into school work she<br/>\nis not going to share with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; She has no learning problems and is quite bright. She does have an<br/>\n&gt; interest..computers, she just won&#39;t share that with me and it&#39;s her<br/>\n&gt; only interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually I think that her interest are the places she is going on the<br/>\ncomputer - not the computer itself.  The computer is just a tool, a<br/>\nmeans to get to that which she is interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question is how do I meet state requirements if I can&#39;t keep a log<br/>\n&gt; because of my daughter&#39;s unwillingness?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Join a 600 school and forget about &quot;state requirementst.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How do I get her interested<br/>\n&gt; in doing anything or at the very least share with me what she does on<br/>\n&gt; the computer. She tells me I don&#39;t have the right too know.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like you need to regain her trust.  Until she knows you are<br/>\ngoing to give her room, not judge what she is doing and not turn it<br/>\ninto an educational lesson she is not going to open up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not having problems with her. She just feels she&#39;s right and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; wrong and she&#39;s not going to help me in anyway. I told her about the<br/>\n&gt; homeschool laws and asked for her help. She told me I was lying.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, you weren&#39;t lying, but you didn&#39;t have all the information<br/>\navailable to you!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (yes, I showed her the law itself, she didn&#39;t understand it and still<br/>\n&gt; called me a lier.

My son HATES formal instruction in math, but he is practically addicted to the math arcade on funbrain.com, and we just got him a new math cd for the computer called Math Blaster, which he asked &quot;permission&quot; to play this morning (as if...).  I have never been good at basic math myself, so it is with great relief that I see him mastering basic facts, which DO make real life easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nRenee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countrycottage10@...\">countrycottage10@...</a>&gt; wrote:  Hello, Im a newbie to the forum,<br/>\nI have been homeschooling my son since he was 4, I was looking at the <br/>\nunschooling approach but Im afraid, :( We have always used work books, <br/>\nbut now that he is in 3rd grade, well he seems to hate most of them :( <br/>\nSome he seems to have trouble with like 3rd grade math has <br/>\nmultiplication in it and he is just not ready for that, they seem to <br/>\nhave stuff he just isnt ready for, it seems like with the books they <br/>\nare rushing him through the stuff just like public school does and <br/>\nwell while he still enjoys homeschooling i dont want the books to put <br/>\nhim off learingmso I thought unschooling, but I have no clue on where <br/>\nto start or how,<br/>\nlately i put the books on the shelf, and he does things on his own <br/>\nlike reading,writing,drawing,computer,gardening and he seems to enjoy <br/>\nit when no books are involved.<br/>\nOh did i say he HATED the grammer book, although he loves the phonics <br/>\nbook,he loves hearing stories about history and he does enjoy his <br/>\npresidential book,he loves to read and discuss the story he just <br/>\nread,he dont mind printing but getting him to do cursive thats a <br/>\nbattle and i dont want that.<br/>\nhe likes math but doesnt does that make sence, <br/>\nhe loves art,drawing,painting. he loves to help cook also<br/>\nok im babbling, does any one have any suggestions please<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

I have been unschooling my two sons, age 13 and<br/>\n16 for two years. My 16 year old was diagnosed with having dyslexia and<br/>\nthen we were told he was bipolar. This was while he was attending public<br/>\nschool. Each year was a nightmare. Since he has been taught at home - or<br/>\nuntaught - he is 98% healthier. We were told he does not have bipolar.<br/>\nIt was the constant stress that was driving him mad. His entire manner<br/>\nhas changed. The clothes he wears are brighter. He lost 50 pounds, etc.<br/>\nI am extraordinarily happy that he is doing so much better. My 13 year<br/>\nold has matured so much that people think he is 17. He actually wants to<br/>\nlearn for the sake of knowing. He questions everything and learns that<br/>\nway. <br/>\nI think public school causes much more damage, in general, than it helps<br/>\nour society. I think the damage to the child continues into adulthood.<br/>\nThat is my opinion. I think it is incredibly sad. Like anything else<br/>\nthat is outside the norm for the time, it has taken us time to unprogram<br/>\nand get used to unschooling. Along with redirecting our thought<br/>\nprocesses we have opened up to much more of life in general.
