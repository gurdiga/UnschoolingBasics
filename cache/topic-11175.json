My older sister actually began screaming at me (spitting in my face -<br/>\nshe was so close) at the mere mention of homeschooling, let alone unschooling. Her exact <br/>\nwords, I believe, were &quot; You&#39;re going to ruin your son!&quot;.   My best advice to you is to keep <br/>\nyour comments back to a bare minimum.  Tell her what she wants to hear, frame your <br/>\nlearning experience in terms she relates to and try to keep from spending  much time <br/>\ninteracting with her.   Ultimately people like these don&#39;t want to hear our explanations or <br/>\nrationale.   Anything that you do differently they take as an indictment on the way they are <br/>\ndoing or have done things.  Just remember that your focus is your children and not <br/>\nspending time and effort trying to &quot;convert&quot;  naysaying family members.<br/>\nNow, if she were ever genuinely interested in unschooling, I&#39;d recommend sending Rue <br/>\nKream&#39;s book or Sandra&#39;s MOVING A PUDDLE.  Alfie Kohn&#39;s PUNISHED BY REWARDS is a <br/>\ngood way of explaing the damaging effects of testing and grading on learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there,<br/>\nRobin<br/>\nMa to Luca, 6 and Lillian 4</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11152,"nextTopicId":11178}}
