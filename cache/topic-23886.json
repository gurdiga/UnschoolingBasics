But when we  <br/>\nthink in terms of How can I get what I want without imposing on  <br/>\nothers, then it&#39;s not so much hard as requiring flexibility and  <br/>\ncreativity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs unschooling parents we provide our kids with the freedom to  <br/>\nexplore their interests. We aren&#39;t handing them the right to do  <br/>\nwhatever they please. As we help them explore ways to explore their  <br/>\ninterests, part of our help will be respecting the needs of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of us probably grew up deprived of power. There was a promise  <br/>\n(maybe sometimes spoken, sometimes unspoken) by our parents that we&#39;d  <br/>\nget our turn to do what we wanted when we grew up but now it was  <br/>\ntheir turn. (They, too, were victims of the same promise and were  <br/>\npassing it on as a legacy.) The problem was it was a lie. We realize  <br/>\nwhen we get to be adults that though we have the freedom to do what  <br/>\nwe want, we also take on a load of responsibilities which seems to  <br/>\neat into our freedom*. (We also unconsciously have filled our heads  <br/>\nfull of &quot;no&quot; scripts from our parents about things we thought we&#39;d be  <br/>\nable to do when we were grown up: stay up all night, eat ice cream  <br/>\nfor breakfast, sing at the dinner table and so on.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(It helps a lot to see our responsibilities not as chains but as  <br/>\nchoices. We *could* drop every single one of our responsibilities at  <br/>\nany point. We *choose* not to. We also choose the level and manner  <br/>\nthat we&#39;ll perform them. I think it&#39;s a very important, helpful --  <br/>\nand freeing :-) -- mental shift.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAdults can end up feeling like our time belongs to our duties to our  <br/>\nhomes and duties to our kids and duties to any other responsibilities  <br/>\nwe have. When is it *our* turn -- our turn that was promised to us?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo most adults, as did their parents, end up taking from their kids  <br/>\nto meet their own needs to &quot;do what they want&quot;. They want to sing,  <br/>\nthey want to watch their TV show, they want to listen to their music  <br/>\non the radio in the car, tough on the kids. When kids ask for what  <br/>\nfeels like an extra burden: drive them to get the newest game release  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been waiting for, but another toy, go to the waterpark, it  <br/>\njust feels like it&#39;s more that&#39;s stolen from our non-existent freedom  <br/>\nto &quot;do what we want&quot;. So parents retaliate -- though it feels like  <br/>\nself protection -- by saying no.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we don&#39;t need to continue that legacy. We can, as many suggest,  <br/>\nnurture the deprived child in us by giving to our own children what  <br/>\nwas denied us. We can stop seeing living as a power struggle to get  <br/>\nwhat we want and be our children&#39;s advocate in getting what they  <br/>\nwant. If they feel that someone places great importance on what they  <br/>\nwant, if they feel that they will get what they want in a timely  <br/>\nmanner, there&#39;s no reason to feel the need to step on others to get  <br/>\nit. We&#39;re social creatures so we do want to get along with others.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s just that the natural instinct to cooperate when our own needs  <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel like they&#39;re being met. We can help kids meet *both*  <br/>\nneeds: their spoken need and the unspoken need to get along with others.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23819,"nextTopicId":23745}}
