Here&#39;s a set of older engines on-line: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/theme_See%20the%20engines%20at%20work.asp,\">http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/theme_See%20the%20engines%20at%20work.asp,</a><br/>\n but it isn&#39;t loud enough. Engines should be louder. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could build simple engines, like rocket launchers with vinegar and baking <br/>\nsoda as the propellant. I was going to say that wasn&#39;t really an engine, but <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine</a> talks about siege engines, converting force <br/>\ninto motion machines, so it may just work. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.metacafe.com/watch/2371437/home_experiment_film_canister_rockets/\">http://www.metacafe.com/watch/2371437/home_experiment_film_canister_rockets/</a> has <br/>\nsome a very basic set up. Ooh, a pop pop boat. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sciencetoymaker.org/boat/index.htm\">http://www.sciencetoymaker.org/boat/index.htm</a> is how to make one, but you can <br/>\nusually find already made, metal ones around. That&#39;s a really simple engine. <br/>\nDavid suggested that there are steam engines you can build from kits available. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forest-classics.co.uk/Basic%20Boiler%20Kit.htm\">http://www.forest-classics.co.uk/Basic%20Boiler%20Kit.htm</a> is an example, <br/>\nalthough as I don&#39;t know where you live it may not be a relevant one. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAsking a mechanic is a good idea. I asked David, he said the internal combustion <br/>\nengine is just controlled explosions. And if I wanted he could show me how that <br/>\nworked ;o). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: keeliereader &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keeliebean@...\">keeliebean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 28 September, 2011 4:04:31<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Mechanical child<br/>\n<br/>\nHello, <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son (3yrs) has alwsys been into cars and trains and how things work.
