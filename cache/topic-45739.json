Its not uncommon for moms in your situation to feel closer to zombies than parents! Overtired is probably inevitable, and maybe grumpy, too. You can practice not acting on &quot;grumpy&quot; and work on shifting your focus to more positive thoughts when you&#39;re tired, but with two little kids, you *will* be tired on a regular basis. <br/>\n<br/>\nRather then hoping for some impossible ideal, look for ways to set yourself up so you can function when you&#39;re tired. That includes meeting your essential needs proactively and considering what sorts of things you need mental clarity for. For instance, I&#39;m not a &quot;night person&quot; so I&#39;d put some extra energy into setting myself up for a mellow evening. I&#39;d make sure that by the time &quot;dinner time&quot; was over all I needed to do was be present for my kids.

Our 3 1/2 year old needs nine hours sleep a day, including any naps. This is his rhythm, so I&#39;m not looking to try to interfere with that, more looking for strategies for my fatigue, and DH&#39;s. We have a little three month old too, she seems to be the opposite in terms of sleep ie sleeps loads, but it&#39;s still tiring, though I was actually more tired when I was pregnant than now, surprisingly.<br/>\nYesterday, for example, DS was up at 9am, had a nap from 4-6pm-ish, and finally fell asleep at just gone 2am which is exactly predictable according to his pattern timewise. The only thing we do is to usually (though not always) try to entice him to not nap longer than about two hours, as we&#39;ve let the naps play out fully and ended up being awake from say midnight to 6 or 7am, after five or six hours of nap. He doesn&#39;t seem overtired at all, and lots of physical activity doesn&#39;t change his length of day or night&#39;s sleep, so I think he is really fine, it&#39;s just us (parents) who need a few ideas of how to make it through a fifteen hour day of intense present loving parenting while managing to keep our energy and also keep from getting overwhelmed. I&#39;m trying out some Bach&#39;s flower remedies  - Hornbeam, Beech, Pine & Larch. Id welcome other suggestions. We have a few activities which are low key & often end the day with an hour plus of watching Mighty Machines, Bob the Builder or YouTube construction etc videos. Puzzles and Lego are popular and somewhat relaxing, as is a &#39;read-in&#39;. He is just transitioning into playing without our imput 100%, and has begun setting up his train sets and construction projects himself too so I imagine we will get some downtime at some point in the next year or so. But meanwhile I wondered if any one else had had this experience, and if so, if they had any tips or advice - practical or emotional or therapeutic - ie herbal remedies or such for energy etc. I can&#39;t do caffeine at the moment due to bfeeding. Any thoughts will be welcome. I really don&#39;t want to get overtired and grumpy, but I do on occasion, and I would like to help sidestep that if at all possible.<br/>\nWith thanks,<br/>\nCornelia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45742,"nextTopicId":4029}}
