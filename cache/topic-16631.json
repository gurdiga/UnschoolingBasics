Most of<br/>\nthe time I can, but when it happens a few times an hour all day, I<br/>\nhave trouble.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the key is to fill yourself up when he doesn&#39;t need you. Good<br/>\nself-care when our children are happily involved in a tv show or fun<br/>\nactivity is a great way to stay focused on them when they need you. <br/>\nFive years old is so very little. They really need a lot of you still,<br/>\nespecially as the oldest child.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Jalen has older siblings to play with some of the time, so there is<br/>\nquite a bit more &quot;engaged&quot; time where he doesn&#39;t need me...though his<br/>\nintense behaviors more than make up for that! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can really &quot;fill him up&quot; when he needs you, really BE with him<br/>\nand enjoy your time together, maybe that will make it possible for him<br/>\nto not feel rushed. If he senses that you don&#39;t really want to be with<br/>\nhim, it will cause more neediness, not less. Focus on him when you&#39;re<br/>\nthere in the games, focus on his joy and what he needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou aren&#39;t going to &quot;teach&quot; him problem solving. He&#39;ll learn it as<br/>\nhe&#39;s ready by having people around him model it and fulfill his very<br/>\nreal needs. He NEEDS what he&#39;s asking for. It&#39;s not some &quot;negative&quot;<br/>\nway to act.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould it be possible that you&#39;re expecting something more of him just<br/>\nbecause he&#39;s that magical &quot;school age&quot; now? He&#39;s a wee little man that<br/>\nneeds a lot of his Mum. Giving him what he needs now, is no different<br/>\nthan responding to our infants cries. He&#39;s communicating needs, you<br/>\nhave a choice to responds warmly and fully, or being annoyed with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16629,"nextTopicId":16552}}
