Uggh.  Anyway, this morning she (mom) made a comment to me about<br/>\nhow her 9yo ds wanted to show Saylor a magic trick, and the mom said, yeah,<br/>\nyou should, and then he said &quot;but, it&#39;s got math in it and Saylor doesn&#39;t<br/>\nknow Math, he said he really wants to know it, but he doesn&#39;t&quot;  (this is her<br/>\nrendition of the story to me).  So, I&#39;m trying to figure out if she&#39;s<br/>\ndropping some sort of judgement on me, like &quot;i can&#39;t believe you aren&#39;t<br/>\nteaching your kid math&quot;, or what?  I did talk to Saylor about that, asking<br/>\nhim if he told his friend he &quot;didn&#39;t know Math&quot;, Saylor said he never said<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like my ds isn&#39;t happy sometimes.
