Even when I was a GS myself I changed the motto (or <br/>\nis it the slogan?) to &quot;Be OVER prepared&quot;. I appreciate that the <br/>\norganization takes girl&#39;s safety seriously, but it&#39;s so overdone <br/>\nsometimes that it restricts what the girls can do. For example, the <br/>\nSafety Wise book (program Bible...) says something like &quot;parents helping <br/>\nwith transportation can use any insured vehicle as long as it has side <br/>\nairbags&quot;. Side airbags?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am seriously contemplating trying to get a &quot;group&quot; together where each <br/>\ngirl is registered as an individual Juliette. That way the parents <br/>\nretain responsibility for safety and we can decide as a group what to do <br/>\nwithout all the paper work and difficult to get trainings. The girls <br/>\nlike the group experienced but registering and maintaining a troop is a <br/>\nlot of red tape, especially if you live in a rural area of a less <br/>\npopulous state. Our council is a 4 hour drive away and most of the <br/>\ntrainings are held there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; their own goals.

I&#39;d like to think our group listens  <br/>\nmore to the kids. I&#39;ve had to push though. The leadership training  <br/>\nDOES emphasize that the boys should be involved in all choices. Once  <br/>\nthey cross from cubs into boy scouts, it is DEFINITELY more scout  <br/>\nled. They run the meetings, they plan activities as well as volunteer  <br/>\nopportunities, and a good leader is able to balance their need for  <br/>\nassistance with letting them make choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nSOOO much depends on the troop, as well as the patrol and the adult  <br/>\nleader. Everything is so different, the implementation depends on the  <br/>\npeople involved. The organization definitely leads towards scouts  <br/>\nover the age of 12 making choices though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for being Christ-centered, as Kelly says, some units take that  <br/>\nvery seriously. However, the organization itself says in training  <br/>\nmaterials that all leaders are to be open to differences of  <br/>\nreligions. Our adult leader is an orthodox Jew, and the scout leader  <br/>\nis a Muslim (altho they invited us to our very first smoke lodge to  <br/>\ncelebrate the solstice!), while the assistant patrol leader is an  <br/>\natheist.
