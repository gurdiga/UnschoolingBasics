They have all been SO helpful and have given <br/>\nme a lot to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Mary said, to leave the learning co op would be a grieving <br/>\nprocess, for sure. What an amazing group of mothers and children. BUT <br/>\nthey do hold events that we may still be able to share in from time to <br/>\ntime. For instance, I plan many field trips with them. It&#39;s good for a <br/>\ndiscount rate and it always adds to the fun :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in regards to leaving Christian at home.. He&#39;s been left home <br/>\nmany times for about a year now. The issue I have is with the time and <br/>\ndistance. The more I mull it over though, there ~may~ be a way to <br/>\narrange with my second shift husband and to simply ~not~ stay all day. <br/>\nI did talk to Christian again about it. He IS happy to be there. Maybe <br/>\nhe just doesn&#39;t need the classes, or needs the option to NOT attend if <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t want, or to just not go. He does enjoy the courses.. <br/>\nthere&#39;s art and science and chess. It&#39;s definately more school-y than <br/>\nunschooling but not nearly what it may sound. There&#39;s no homework, the <br/>\nkids&#39; interests are followed in choosing what to talk about, etc. <br/>\nHaving been our first year at this, it was a nice &#39;bridge&#39; for the <br/>\ntime being while we were finding our way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also taken much of the advice on the board and started delving <br/>\ninto my own interests again. I picked up the neatest book on country <br/>\nliving and I have bread rising in the kitchen as we speak! I love <br/>\ngardening and my beds look nice this year (so far) and I&#39;ve begun <br/>\nplanting in my vegetable garden. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, bottom line is THANK YOU everyone. I ~loved~ hearing about your <br/>\nexperiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarm regards,<br/>\nTonya</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13969,"nextTopicId":13859}}
