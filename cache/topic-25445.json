If you think it&#39;s bad <br/>\nnow, just wait until the 5th, 6th, & 7th grade time period!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that there is a LOT of teaching going on in schools <br/>\nduring this time; and since the students are still in a learning mode, <br/>\nthey&#39;ll seem to know so much more than your own, unschooled kids. <br/>\nWhat&#39;s good to keep im mind is that they aren&#39;t RETAINING much of this! <br/>\nSure, they can regurgitate a bunch of facts, but it&#39;s not really <br/>\nlearning that sticks. our children are *absorbing* HUGE amounts of <br/>\nfacts and figures and ...schtuff! But it&#39;s not yet regurgitable. &lt;G&gt; <br/>\nHere: Schooled kids are *swallowing* the info and spitting it back out. <br/>\nYOUR kids are DIGESTING a lot of the same material---it&#39;s becoming part <br/>\nof them---just like longer bones and more skin and bigger teeth. But <br/>\nyour children&#39;s knowledge won&#39;t show up <br/>\nas....something.....*Tangible*!...until quite a while afterwards. Can <br/>\nyou understand my analogy? I think it&#39;s a pretty good one. &lt;G&gt; I just <br/>\nhope it&#39;s as good to others out there reading. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled children&#39;s learning will show up months/years later when you <br/>\nleast expect it---just like that couple of inches your child grew last <br/>\nsummer---WHEN did that happen? Well, all along! It just wasn&#39;t as <br/>\nnoticable! Learning&#39;s sneaky like that! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really will look worse in &quot;middle school&quot;---the schooled kids will <br/>\nsee, themsleves, how much they are being taught---AND they are being <br/>\ntold how important this schtuff is. Some may throw it in your <br/>\nunschooled child&#39;s face (which, as a parent, is REALLY hard to take!). <br/>\nBut if you can be patient for just a couple more years, the pay-off <br/>\nhits---and hits HARD! THose very same kids who were so sure school was <br/>\nTHE answer will now start hating their teachers and school---and even <br/>\ntheir parents for making them go to school! Worst of all, they learn to <br/>\nhate learning! The tables will turn, and suddenly YOUR child is the one <br/>\nwith so much freedom and whose learning is finally tangible---you can <br/>\nSEE the spark in his eyes and that there will never be enough time for <br/>\nhim to gobble up everything he wants to learn. The schooled schildren <br/>\nare now jaded and *done* with learning---they&#39;re *full*, overstuffed, <br/>\nloosening that belt-buckle so that *THEY * can just relax and digest <br/>\nfor a while. In fact. they have been giving NO time to digest what <br/>\nthey&#39;ve learned. Twelve or more years of being crammed FULL! They&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen the goose, forced-fed until they&#39;re about to pop---no room for <br/>\n*any* more facts. They quit. They won&#39;t be hungry for learning for a <br/>\nlong, long time!<br/>\n<br/>\nI know how hard it is to be on the other side of that curve! It was <br/>\nvery painful to watch Cam when he was 13 & 14. But now *he* can see how <br/>\nlittle his friends want to learn anything new. It&#39;s very sad, because <br/>\nhe knew them when they were creative, curious five year olds who <br/>\ndevoured all new things. They&#39;ve stopped learning---they&#39;re just <br/>\nsurviing until they can refind/rediscover themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best advice I can give to look at some older schooled kids, som <br/>\neteens who have given up. Is that what you want for your child?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou KNOW your child is smart. You KNOW he finds joy in learnning. That <br/>\nreally needs to be enough right now. PLEASE don&#39;t let him lose that <br/>\nthrill of learning! Just because he can&#39;t regurgitate like the schooled <br/>\nkids---that&#39;s NOT a bad thing! Let him take things slowly (or fast---at <br/>\nHIS pace) and digest as he goes! MUCH healthier for his brain&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;digestive&quot; tract! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.

Recently her mom has started backing off on the &quot;writing <br/>\nrequirements&quot; bc her dd is starting to say she hates to write.  Mom <br/>\nhas also dropped &quot;spelling lessons&quot; bc while her dd can spell in a <br/>\nquiz format, she can&#39;t spell the same words when she goes to write a <br/>\nsentence. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your dd is writing bc she chooses to, that&#39;s fantastic.

The way free kids learn about math is very <br/>\nfluid and experiential and so it doesn&#39;t &quot;look&quot; very much like the <br/>\nway math is taught in schools. For example, on their own, kids often <br/>\nlearn about fractions before they add - and almost certainly before <br/>\nthey subtract. Exploring volume, btw, is part of that. While your dd <br/>\nmay not be able to express herself by means of saying &quot;mom, I&#39;d like <br/>\ntwenty percent more milk, please&quot; I&#39;ll bet she can show you with her <br/>\nfingers how much more she would like poured out.

She <br/>\ncan quote the tax code left, right and center, but 7+9? <br/>\nComputational aids have been available for millenia for a reason ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I see her picking up reading <br/>\n&gt; by me reading to her, sounding out words when she asks, but it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>isn&#39;t a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; smooth process for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ahhhhh, a misconception! Learning isn&#39;t necessarily &quot;smooth&quot;. Its <br/>\nnot a sequential process. Learning often happens in &quot;spurts&quot; - like <br/>\ngrowing, but unlike growing, sometimes learning seems to go backward <br/>\nfor a little while and then springs forward a whole lot. <br/>\nThose &quot;backward&quot; times can be really rich in terms of building <br/>\ndifferent kinds of connections, though. Times to integrate one kind <br/>\nof learning into the whole self, maybe. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How to stop wanting to get <br/>\n&gt; Math-u-see for dd as she is so hands on <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All that being said, expecially if you&#39;re worried about math, it <br/>\nmight be helpful for *you* to look at a few different math programs <br/>\nand expand your own theoretical knowledge about math-learning. Kind <br/>\nof depends on how *you* learn, though - it might just amp up your <br/>\nown concerns. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as manipulatives go, do you have legos or other construction <br/>\ntoys? How about paint? Does she like to cook? Play in the mud? <br/>\nDance? Throw? Arrange things? Cut, glue and tape?

What do you do when you feel panicky about your &quot;rhythm&quot; as an <br/>\nunschooler/unschool ing family? When you feel the kids <br/>\naren&#39;t &quot;learning &quot; anything (because it isn&#39;t always in a measureable-<br/>\nby-school-standards - sense) <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a just turned 7 yr old and 4 yr old. I try to focus on living a <br/>\njoyful life with them, to remember as Joyce Fetterol on her site says <br/>\nthe 3 R&#39;s will come about as they are tools obtained as a result of <br/>\nkids just living life and doing what they are interested in and not <br/>\nalways to be taught separately out of context. I feel so confused right <br/>\nnow. Dd writes somewhat, we certainly never have had spelling lessons <br/>\nas she spells a word here or there on her drawings, but the actual <br/>\nphysical act of it is tedious to her. She has a basic math sense in <br/>\nterms of volume, bigger and smaller, etc but could not even BEGIN to <br/>\ncompute/calculate, and of course it worries me when she has friends who <br/>\nspent an hour everyday in school playing with manipulatives, learning <br/>\nthe concept of adding up to 18, etc. I guess I am thinking that she <br/>\nwill still be counting on fingers at 18! I see her picking up reading <br/>\nby me reading to her, sounding out words when she asks, but it isn&#39;t a <br/>\nsmooth process for her.

If the creative aspect is at <br/>\nissue, offer to be her &quot;secretary&quot; - I&#39;ve got pages and pages of <br/>\nstories DS (9) has told - if it seems like it&#39;s going to be <br/>\na &#39;keeper&#39; story (sometimes he&#39;s just running stream of <br/>\nconsciousness and other times he has an idea he wants to keep), I&#39;ll <br/>\ngrab paper and a pen and try to keep up (luckily, I can do a form <br/>\nof &quot;shorthand&quot; so I can keep up most of the time). Then <br/>\nI&#39;ll &#39;translate&#39; it so DS can read it later. Again, step back and <br/>\nsee that learning IS happening, but it is happening the same way she <br/>\ndigests that apple she had with her lunch - invisible to you, <br/>\ninvisible in many ways to her as well, but happening nonetheless.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;She has a basic math sense in <br/>\n&gt; terms of volume, bigger and smaller, etc but could not even BEGIN <br/>\n&gt;to <br/>\n&gt; compute/calculate, and of course it worries me when she has <br/>\n&gt;friends who <br/>\n&gt; spent an hour everyday in school playing with manipulatives, <br/>\n&gt;learning <br/>\n&gt; the concept of adding up to 18, etc. I guess I am thinking that <br/>\n&gt;she <br/>\n&gt; will still be counting on fingers at 18!   <br/>\n </span></blockquote>And the problem with that is...? I know adults that still use <br/>\nfingers at times (although many of them move to pocket calculators <br/>\nand such). You&#39;d really be surprised at what she organically knows - <br/>\nit just doesn&#39;t show up until/unless she needs it. Why does a 7 yr <br/>\nold really NEED to do written done, drilled &quot;arithmetic problems&quot;? <br/>\nCurrently, at our house, 9 yr old never schooled DS has recently <br/>\nexpressed a desire to focus more on number skills (way long story <br/>\nbehind that short phrase). His choice is for me to write out a <br/>\nNumber Question of the Day for him. When I get home from work, he <br/>\nshows me the answer (sometimes he works it out himself, sometimes he <br/>\nasks DH for assistance). It&#39;s been 4 days and so far I&#39;ve learned <br/>\nthat he has a deep, organic grasp of concepts that are not <br/>\nnormally &#39;taught&#39; until somewhere around 7th grade while at the same <br/>\ntime still using fingers (and toes and nose) to handle basic <br/>\ncalculations. And that&#39;s fine. What he&#39;s learned is that he actually <br/>\nDOES know &quot;math&quot;, he just needed a reminder about it. For instance, <br/>\none of the earlier questions I posed was &quot;If you are 9 now and can <br/>\nget a driver&#39;s license at 16, how many years until you can drive a <br/>\ncar?&quot; Now, most likely you and I would go 16-9=7, right? However, DS <br/>\nexplained to me that the way he got that answer was as follows:<br/>\n9+9=18 (he knows that because it&#39;s double his age, anything with a <br/>\npersonal reference point &#39;sticks&#39; well)<br/>\n16 is 2 less than 18<br/>\nTherefore, if he removes 2 from one of the 9s, that makes 7, which <br/>\nis the answer<br/>\n[which is also basic algebraic thinking - doing the same thing to <br/>\nboth sides of the equation]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I see her picking up reading <br/>\n&gt; by me reading to her, sounding out words when she asks, but it <br/>\n&gt;isn&#39;t a <br/>\n&gt; smooth process for her. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>It *won&#39;t* be a &quot;smooth&quot; process - it will have bumps and jumps and <br/>\nstops and starts and forward and back - learning is NOT a linear <br/>\nthing, despite what we&#39;ve been trained to think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; like I am not &quot;doing enough&quot; especially with them, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>What exactly is &quot;enough&quot;? How much time is &quot;enough&quot;? How many books <br/>\nis &quot;enough&quot;? How many &quot;field trips&quot; is &quot;enough&quot;? Get where I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing? What is &quot;plenty&quot; for us may be &quot;not enough&quot; for you and vice <br/>\nversa. And what is &quot;plenty&quot; today might be &quot;not enough&quot; tomorrow <br/>\neven with the same child. Again, getting back to food analogies, <br/>\nsometimes I want MOUNDS of strawberries and other times, just a <br/>\nsmall handful and other times, no thanks. So, consider carefully <br/>\nwhat you&#39;re using as your measure of &quot;enough&quot;. Do the kids seem like <br/>\nthey&#39;re content or are they a bit fidgety lately? Maybe you are in a <br/>\nrut and need a jolt, a trip to a different park, different grocery <br/>\nstore, pick up some inexpensive bright colored somethings to play <br/>\nwith together, have a different arrangement to your day (have <br/>\npancakes for dinner, wear your underwear outside your clothing, <br/>\nwhatever).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am not bringing <br/>\n&gt; enough into their lives, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>What are you bringing into your own life? If you&#39;re spending ALL <br/>\nyour time focused on what they AREN&#39;T doing, likely you&#39;re also not <br/>\nexploring what you are drawn to as well. Pick up an old hobby or get <br/>\na new one - doesn&#39;t have to be something you do really well, just <br/>\nsomething you love or have wondered about for a while. Wear fuchsia! <br/>\nRead a different genre than usual! Walk around the block <br/>\ncounterclockwise instead of clockwise! Like they say, be <br/>\ninteresting - to your own self. Have you ever gone to the video <br/>\nstore and seen the signs &quot;if you liked x, try these&quot; and they have a <br/>\nshelf of related movies (same director, actors, theme/genre, etc) - <br/>\nwell, go for it - pick up that other movie that&#39;s by the same <br/>\ndirector or whatever. Look at what the kids are loving and hit the <br/>\nlibrary and dollar store and wherever for related stuff to have on <br/>\nhand (not require, just &#39;strew&#39; it about). Find cartoons that are by <br/>\nthe same animators or have a similar animation style; find books <br/>\nthat incorporate those characters (Dora, Spongebob, Jimmy Neutron, <br/>\netc all have short books in the &quot;learning to read&quot; section of the <br/>\nbookstore for maybe $3 each); find Dora color Legos (they actually <br/>\nhave pink Legos!), explore fairies or physics or Spanish or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds as though the fears that come with having a non-&quot;typical&quot; <br/>\nchild are permeating your whole life. Take a breath. Have a cup of <br/>\ntea. Catch this cyber {{HUG}}. Remember that acting from fear is not <br/>\nacting, it&#39;s REacting. Instead of reacting, be pro-active. You&#39;re <br/>\ndoing what needs doing, advocating for your children, and it&#39;s great <br/>\nthat you&#39;re looking for ways to bring things home from various <br/>\ntherapies rather than simply throwing up your hands and letting <br/>\nthe &quot;experts&quot; do whatever they want. Let yourself *grieve* for the <br/>\nthings you expected that now may have changed. Life will go on no <br/>\nmatter what - which path will you take to the next minute, and the <br/>\nnext, and the next?<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224117939,"authorName":"Tina Bragdon","from":"&quot;Tina Bragdon&quot; &lt;jamesandtina942@...&gt;","profile":"crazycanuckgurl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"having a bit of a panic attack here!","postDate":"1186072165","msgId":25445,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY4dDBwNSs3N3ViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25447,"prevInTime":25444,"nextInTime":25446,"topicId":25445,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Help!
