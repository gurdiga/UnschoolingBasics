My Mom yelled all the time, we totally tuned her out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really feel like I didn&#39;t take the time with my post about saying<br/>\n&quot;STOP&quot; though. Not enough info. I guess because my children and I have<br/>\nbuilt these relationships of trust, I CAN say &quot;stop now&quot; and they know<br/>\nI have a good reason. But it certainly doesn&#39;t have to be in a loud<br/>\nvoice either.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike with the sleeping brother. I would have kept my voice soft and<br/>\nsaid very clearly &quot;that is NOT ok, come over here with me please&quot; or<br/>\nsomething that would get the child out of that area so you could give<br/>\nhugs, or discuss or whatever needs to be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some children, a hug while saying &quot;stop that&quot; will work great. If<br/>\nhe was too angry to be touched yet, it might not work.  I might have<br/>\nsaid &quot;I&#39;m going to bring this toy into the other room, because I can<br/>\nsee you really want to push the noisy button, but it is NOT ok to wake<br/>\nyour brother&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are SO many options, none of them include ignoring the fact that<br/>\nhe refused to let the room stay quiet for the person that is sleeping.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15593,"nextTopicId":15590}}
