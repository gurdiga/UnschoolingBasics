But now he has a couple<br/>\ndifferent styles. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, some things that helped me:<br/>\nI would totally prefer my son to learn the safe way to handle guns of<br/>\nany kind with my support than without it. He&#39;s not one to go behind my<br/>\nback, but he has no reason to. And I&#39;d bet the kids going around your<br/>\nneighborhood shooting birds and pets don&#39;t have the support of a<br/>\nloving grown-up. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son recently joined a &quot;shooting sports&quot; club (through 4H, if your<br/>\nin the U.S.) so that he can dive deeper into his love of guns and bows<br/>\nand arrows. All the parents participate and are very involved with<br/>\nhelping their kids be safe and responsible. There will be shooting<br/>\npractice at a shooting range and everyone gets a chance to make their<br/>\nown bow and arrows if they want. It&#39;s very cool and <br/>\n<br/>\nour life would look very different if I had just said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry--I<br/>\nhate guns and the death and murder that happens with them and you<br/>\ncan&#39;t have an airsoft right now.&quot; Do I still get uncomfortable with<br/>\nguns? Yes, sometimes. And my son knows this. My fears and past are not<br/>\nmy son&#39;s problem. Do I say I hate guns anymore? No. I&#39;ve grown. I know<br/>\nthe difference between safe and responsible gun handling and hideous<br/>\ncrimes. I still get afraid, but I&#39;m learning how empowering it is for<br/>\nme to learn about something I used to fear. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would strongly encourage you to be open to your son and find a way<br/>\nto say &quot;yes&quot; for the airsoft gun. It would be an awesome way to show<br/>\nyour son that you trust him. And researching places for him to go<br/>\nabout using it safely can give him some guidance. And you&#39;ll learn a<br/>\nwhole lot. You&#39;ll be a team with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a &quot;Here&#39;s your new gun! See you at dinner time, honey.&quot;<br/>\nThere&#39;s all sorts of ways to go about getting both your needs met--you<br/>\nwant safety (I&#39;m guessing) and he wants a gun. There are many ways to<br/>\nsay yes.<br/>\n~~Juillet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;caradove&quot; &lt;caradove@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My twelve yo has been campaigning for an airsoft gun for a few weeks<br/>\n&gt; now.

I am very uncomfortable about guns, I grew up in N Ireland with a<br/>\nstrong military presence on the streets daily, shootings,<br/>\nknee-cappings on the news, armed checkpoints etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that is my personal experience, we live in a built up area with a<br/>\nsmall yard, there are sometimes kids with pellet or beebee guns<br/>\nwalking around shooting birds dead on the street, a neighbouring town<br/>\nis trying to get them banned.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat interested my son is when we were on vacation way in the country<br/>\nand homeschool friends had airsofts in the woods and shooting targets.<br/>\nThere was no targeting small animals there, round here is a big<br/>\nhunting mentality and plenty of cruelty to dogs, cats, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first reaction is to say no. Can someone suggest an activity where<br/>\nthere is the fun of target practice, maybe something safe for the yard<br/>\nor park, without the gun. Or a link to a product that shoots but is<br/>\nnot fashioned like an actual gun?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nCara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36222,"nextTopicId":36189}}
