I think it&#39;s really useful advice, but especially when you&#39;re<br/>\nfirst starting out this unschooling path:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The happier I have allowed myself to be,<br/>\nthe happier my children have become.<br/>\nThe more I have become myself,<br/>\nthe more they have done the same&quot;<br/>\n#62<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s something I didn&#39;t get in the beginning. Excavating my<br/>\nauthentic self, doing that which is within me, BEing the ME I was<br/>\nmeant to be, has translated into a much happier household with<br/>\nchildren that follow their bliss.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a hard process to describe. When folks start asking about how to<br/>\nhelp their children learn, how to make sure they cover the &quot;basics&quot; or<br/>\nhow to trust their children, I think some of the best advice is to<br/>\nquit focusing on the children!! That doesn&#39;t mean &quot;don&#39;t pay attention<br/>\nto them&quot; because connecting with your children is paramount.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt means quit FOCUSING on how to get to a certain place, or how to GET<br/>\nkids to do anything. Just be with them. Focus instead on your own<br/>\npassions and interests. Pull your children into that which brings you<br/>\nabsolute JOY. Experience the beauty of YOU.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs children grow, they need models of a passionate, interesting and<br/>\nrich life. They need to see what a beautiful life looks like! Give<br/>\nthem that model in yourself and watch the learning unfold.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11241,"nextTopicId":11256}}
