Unschooling Does require resources! Which specific resources will vary depending on the needs and personalities of members of the family, though. There are unschooling families of very limited means and families of much greater financial means which don&#39;t have the resources (personal or social or imaginative) to unschool. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you Can afford to give everyone in the family enough to eat, the issue may be one of shifting your attitudes about what kids &quot;should&quot; be eating and looking for ways to meet everyone&#39;s desires as much as you can. If you treat their desires as valid, then the matter becomes a logistical puzzle rather than one of consequences - how can we make this work?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I leave out a fruit bowl, on child will likely eat all the bananas there.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about banana flavored stuff? That could be a way to give the kids what they want and stretch your dollars. Or, if they&#39;re eating lots of bananas, cut out something else to compensate, like fruit juices (which are expensive! ye gads...).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;if I &quot;allow&quot; a child to eat the whole box of crackers then no children get snack for the week.  I can buy 2 boxes a week.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>********************<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, treat it as a logistical puzzle. If they&#39;re eating whole boxes of crackers, what are they Not eating as a result that you can cut out of the budget for awhile? <br/>\n<br/>\nAlternately, can you make your own crackers? Or make something just as appealing? Home-made baked goods (cookies, cakes, pies, etc) can go a long way toward stretching the budget and creating a happy home environment where food is concerned. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, its not a disaster for some foods to be &quot;luxuries&quot; and to feast on them only to have them disappear for awhile. Foods your kids like to eat every day, though - its worth re-arranging your budget and expectations to Provide those every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Another food question :)","postDate":"1324678418","msgId":47797,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJGOEFDNTg5LTIwRjYtNEU2My05RjcwLTEzQ0UxRjNCMkYyQ0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpkMms0byttb25kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpkMms0byttb25kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47795,"nextInTopic":47800,"prevInTime":47796,"nextInTime":47798,"topicId":47795,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
