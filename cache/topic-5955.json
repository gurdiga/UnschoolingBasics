That&#39;s<br/>\nwhy you can&#39;t say &quot;workbooks aren&#39;t unschooling&quot; because sometimes<br/>\nthey ARE.<br/>\n<br/>\nI encourage families new to this journey, to get away from anything<br/>\nschoolish because all of that can be a stumbling block. But with my<br/>\nunschooled from birth daughter, she has no hang ups about what<br/>\nlearning is or isn&#39;t and she chooses schoolish looking activities<br/>\nsometimes. I don&#39;t worry that she&#39;s valuing it above other kinds of<br/>\nlearning though.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is an attitude, a lifestyle, a belief that only the<br/>\nlearner has the power to gain information and only they can know what<br/>\nis important for their own life journey. There is no way to pick out<br/>\nactivities and label them as unschooling or not.

And What do alot<br/>\nof you do when your feeling really tired and grumpy. I am having<br/>\nanother baby and find myself feeling that way alot!!

Children appreciate that!  Also, <br/>\nif you can warn them that you are tired and may snap at them, they can <br/>\nlearn to do the same. Still apologize when you do snap! But I found <br/>\nthat, if I&#39;m getting touchy and creepy, if I tell the boys that I&#39;m <br/>\ngrouchy, they will be a little kinder and gentler with *me*! I do the <br/>\nsame for them. If we can learn to recognize when our tempers are <br/>\ngetting short, we can better learn to deal with it and ask other for <br/>\nhelp too!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for no bedtimes: that does not mean that you can&#39;t make the <br/>\nsurroundings conducive to sleep! Lights low, warm drink, soft music, <br/>\nsweet book or songs, warm cuddle....I&#39;m getting sleepy already! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":213809267,"authorName":"jlh44music","from":"&quot;jlh44music&quot; &lt;jlh44music@...&gt;","profile":"jlh44music","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Bedtime Ritual (was: Re: Question)","postDate":"1123801902","msgId":6023,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRkZ2x2ZStzNWRxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwODExLjA4MjAzMy4yMDYwLjEuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5999,"nextInTopic":6188,"prevInTime":6022,"nextInTime":6024,"topicId":5955,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... him he could wake me and we d still do the tucking in bedtime stuff.

And yes when we finally dropped it (not a big announcement <br/>\njust saying OK when he wanted to stay up to watch one more episode of <br/>\nwhatever) he did stay up later than usual - for maybe 3 or 4 days. <br/>\nThen he decided that snuggling with mom before mom was mostly asleep <br/>\nwas more to his liking than staying up to watch something he knew he <br/>\ncould watch some other time (since his favorite shows repeat often).
