I agree about the mutual respect of each other&#39;s time. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy strategy is that I am awake for at least an hour before he gets <br/>\nup, that&#39;s when I try to get my most focused work done.  Of course, I <br/>\ncan&#39;t get it all done in an hour or so a day.  But I try to keep it <br/>\nto a before he gets up and after lunch schedule.  That way, when he <br/>\nawakes, I am available for a morning snuggle and breakfast.  Then we <br/>\ndo something together.  Sometimes it&#39;s something I suggested, <br/>\nsometimes it&#39;s his suggestion.  Then if I have more to do, I work <br/>\nafter lunch.  During that time, he uses the computer, makes <br/>\ninventions, works on remote control vehicles, writes in his journal, <br/>\nplays with the dog, etc etc etc.  It helps alot that he is older, <br/>\nthis was a lot bigger challenge when he was little.  Now he has his <br/>\nown interests, and the abilities to pursue many things on his own, <br/>\nwith maybe a little input from me.  Like, &quot;Mom, how can I find _____ <br/>\non the internet?&quot; Also, his dad gets home at 3PM, so if I need really <br/>\nfocused time, I can often get it then with dad doing stuff with our <br/>\nson.  We have a general &quot;no tv in the daytime&quot; rule unless you are <br/>\nsick or on special occasions.  That&#39;s just a personal preference for <br/>\nme.  However, when he was younger, we did not have that rule.  TV can <br/>\nbe a great way to get even a few minutes of down time for mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are right about following your child&#39;s lead.  Every time I think <br/>\nI know the route, a new one appears!  It makes it interesting and <br/>\nalways exciting!

Just pick up the book. Read. Stop when he&#39;s had enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I completely just let my son flow throughout the day as long<br/>\nas learning and teaching responsibility occurs?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, how do you think you could stop him from learning?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you feel you need to *teach* responsibility? Do you not think he <br/>\nlearns that by watching *you* be responsible?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Should the activities happen based on spontaneous learning?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHuh? All learning is based on building upon what we already know. The <br/>\nlearning happens based on the activities---not the other way around.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Moms, it would be<br/>\nnice to know how it works for you.
