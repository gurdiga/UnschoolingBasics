He has learnt that if he agrees, you stop the<br/>\nseemingly endless flow of what may be meaningless seeming talking.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of months ago, Jayn was really upset about leaving the park. She<br/>\nwas crying in the car seat and I was &quot;trying&quot; to be understanding, while<br/>\nstill wanting to get going. I was asking her why she needed to stay, beyond<br/>\nthe agreed upon leave time, and everyone else had gone etc, blah, blah, blah<br/>\n- lots of questions and talking at her. I said, &quot;I want to understand why&quot;.<br/>\nHer immediate reply stopped me cold, &quot;No you don&#39;t.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI instantly realized that I was going through the motions of &quot;communicating&quot;<br/>\nwhile I still had my own agenda, and she knew it before I did. I was trying<br/>\nto manipulate her, while using the wordy &quot;tools&quot; of compromise!  What a<br/>\nwonderful lesson she taught me in that moment. I immediately got out of the<br/>\ncar, and undid her seat belt, offering her to go back to the park, and<br/>\ntelling her that she was right, and thanking her. After a few hugs she was<br/>\nready to go home after all, but that is not the point. Sometimes we think we<br/>\nare being honest and really communicating when we are not, because we are<br/>\nstill trying to a circuitous route to getting our own way, or at least<br/>\nmaking sure that they know we are not happy with their way.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
