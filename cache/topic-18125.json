My house isn&#39;t <br/>\na pigstye, but I&#39;m more relaxed about cleaning and can ignore a lot <br/>\nof things.  DH on the other hand gets annoyed, but he&#39;s pretty good <br/>\nat just doing it (he loves cleaning the bathrooms and toilets, maybe <br/>\nnot as thoroughly as I&#39;d like, but I never complain!).  DD will <br/>\nbring her dishes down stairs voluntarily every day as she likes to <br/>\neat in her room while on the computer.   As far as her room goes, <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s too bad, but it&#39;s a small room and can look <br/>\ncluttered fairly quickly and she&#39;s also not big on putting clean <br/>\nclothes away, they tend to stay in a pile on her bureau etc. so once <br/>\nin a while I&#39;ll ask if she wants me to help her collect the trash <br/>\nand straighten things out, change the sheets (she&#39;s got a queen size <br/>\nbed in the corner so it&#39;s easier with 2 people doing it) etc.  <br/>\nSometimes she wants to do it herself (which often means just pushing <br/>\nthings under the bed!) and sometimes she welcomes my help.  I try to <br/>\nbe aware of how I word things and also to be sensitive to how <br/>\nwelcome my offer of help is being received on any given day (the <br/>\ntiming you mentioned, Tina!).

That me doing for my <br/>\nchildren &quot;too much&quot; will cause them to think that they should be <br/>\nwaited on hand and foot?  What do I say when someone says &quot;chores <br/>\nteach them to be responsible&quot; (that&#39;s usually my husband).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been at the unschooling lifestyle for 3 months, so I&#39;m no <br/>\nexpert.  But letting go of my control issues and allowing my <br/>\nchildren the freedom to say no has actually helped them get involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI discussed that the common areas of the house - living room, dining <br/>\narea and kitchen are for everyone to enjoy.  If they make a mess <br/>\nwhile making toast or popping popcorn they need to clean up and if <br/>\nthey need help with the mess to ask and it will be given.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for their rooms and the sunroom we have (its our resource room - <br/>\npuzzles, games, toys, building blocks, etc) they can make a mess all <br/>\nthey want.  They put clothes in a basket if they want them washed <br/>\nand many times they want to help sort them or throw them in the <br/>\nmachine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night my 7 yo went through the kitchen, living and dining <br/>\nrooms and straighten things up.  I didn&#39;t ask or even suggest it.  <br/>\nBut she said that since I helped her put her clean clothes away and <br/>\nsort out some toys without bugging her, she wanted to help me by <br/>\npicking up dishes, pillows and wiping the counters. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess my response would be that when you treat your child with <br/>\nrespect and allow them to say no, they will return the respect and <br/>\ndevelop their sense of responsibility.  I&#39;m not sure about the <br/>\ndiscipline though - I think that self-discipline comes with knowing <br/>\nwhat you want and how to get there and guiding yourself in order to <br/>\nobtain it.

I suggest that you<br/>\nare responsible only for things that they can�t do for themselves. For example,<br/>\nbabies can�t toilet themselves so we do it for them. Then there is the<br/>\ntransitional period when they can with help but ultimately we realize that they<br/>\ncan consistently take care of themselves (unless they are sick) and we leave it<br/>\nto them.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly with toys, in the beginning we take out the toys<br/>\nand we put them away but when they start taking out the toys, they can help put<br/>\nthem away and ultimately we can say, �You got it out, you put it away.� A cautionary<br/>\nnote here in that if they have been taking toys out all day, the task of<br/>\nputting them all away all at once is overwhelming. Taking the time several<br/>\ntimes during the day to help them put away the toys they are finished with should<br/>\nhasten the day when they think in terms of �take it out, work with it, and put<br/>\nit away� as an unbroken continuum.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen children begin selecting the clothing they want to<br/>\nwear, they can begin to accept some responsibility for its care. They can have<br/>\nsome input. Do they want clothes in dressers drawers or would they rather have<br/>\nthem in bins or laundry baskets? Do they want to put dirty clothes in a hamper<br/>\nin the bathroom, a basket in their room, or some other arrangement?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMesses in common areas impose on others. If living space<br/>\npermits, children may benefit by having an area that is theirs alone and may be<br/>\nmaintained anyway they see fit. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for discipline, it comes from the same root at disciple (which<br/>\nmeans a follower) and that root means to teach. In our society we tend to<br/>\nconfuse discipline with punishment. However punishment isn�t a factor unless<br/>\ndiscipline fails and the child isn�t following. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe encourage children to explore and master their world.<br/>\nPart of that is stewardship, learning how to take care of the things in their charge.<br/>\nPutting away ones toys or clothes isn�t really any different than recycling<br/>\ncans, bottles and paper.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for our resentment of our children, like physical pain,<br/>\nit�s a warning signal that something is going wrong and needs our attention. I<br/>\ngot myself into situations where I felt resentful because while the kids were<br/>\nhappily entertaining themselves, I just let them until they clearly needed my<br/>\nattention. Being on top of things so as to be able to provide guidance at<br/>\nappropriate times takes a lot of energy initially but pays off in the long run.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this is of some help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlice<br/>\nRoddy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96545052,"authorName":"marji","from":"&quot;marji&quot; &lt;marji@...&gt;","profile":"gaia10921","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: responsibility, discipline, and resentment","postDate":"1161350986","msgId":18478,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVoYWowYSsxdnM0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVoYWc5cCs2MmtwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18477,"nextInTopic":18480,"prevInTime":18477,"nextInTime":18479,"topicId":18125,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I mean really sat down with them? Talk to them about<br/>\nall that you do. Give details that they may not see, or have just become so<br/>\nused to seeing you do it that they just don&#39;t notice. Tell them how<br/>\nexhausted you feel come the end of the day and that one person really can&#39;t<br/>\ndo it all. You don&#39;t have to make it sound like a guilt trip. Just be<br/>\nhonest. I have had this conversation with my kids before and it really<br/>\nhelped. We all live here. We all make messes. When I am really overwhelmed<br/>\nand need to get it under control because of company coming or just sanity:-)<br/>\nI ask for help. I believe that everyone&#39;s happiness and comfort in the<br/>\nfamily is important, even the mom. If my husband or a long term guest were<br/>\nleaving messes and expecting me to clean up after them all the time I would<br/>\nhave an issue with that. I don&#39;t feel that there is anything wrong with<br/>\nsaying, &quot;Hey guys, the living room is trashed. Please come clean up your<br/>\nstuff so that we can walk through there.&quot; Or &quot;Guys you made a huge mess in<br/>\nmy bathroom, please come clean it up.&quot; I don&#39;t think it is unreasonable to<br/>\nask others to clean up their own messes. Now, let me also say that I am the<br/>\nfirst one to lend a hand if one of my children need my help and it&#39;s way<br/>\nmore often than not that I am in there with them helping out. I do the bulk<br/>\nof the cleaning around the house because having a clean and orderly house is<br/>\nimportant to me. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to push that on other people. But<br/>\nI do think that cleaning up you own messes is just part of life, unless of<br/>\ncourse you live alone. All I ask is that we keep the common areas of the<br/>\nhouse picked up out of respect and consideration for all who live here. With<br/>\nas many children as you have I can imagine that the house can become a<br/>\ndisaster in a New York second. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also try to come up with a way to streamline the housework a<br/>\nlittle more. Get the kids in on it. Make it a family thing instead of a mom<br/>\nthing. Our homes need regular maintenance just like a car, our bodies, and<br/>\nour relationships. If you were the only one driving your car you would be<br/>\nresponsible for the maintenance but a home is for many peoples enjoyment. <br/>\n<br/>\nI struggled with laundry for many years. When I finally sat down with the<br/>\nfamily and talked to them about what a hard time I was having we decided<br/>\nthat it might be easier to do the laundry one day a week instead of a little<br/>\nat a time. They enjoy helping most of the time. Sometimes I don&#39;t think they<br/>\nreally want to but they usually do anyway. We do things to help each other<br/>\nout. Not everything that someone else wants to do is something that we might<br/>\nwant to do but that&#39;s okay. Example-We go fishing with my husband pretty<br/>\noften. The kids and I don&#39;t really like fishing but we go cuz it makes dad<br/>\nhappy. It&#39;s like a little gift to him. I don&#39;t care for hockey much but my<br/>\nson loves it so I watch with him. I think I&#39;ve gotten off track here but my<br/>\npoint is when a family has a real give and take relationship with each other<br/>\nit flows over naturally to other things. Also, you do have a lot of<br/>\nchildren. Do you think your standards could be lowered for a while? Are<br/>\nthere some things that aren&#39;t really that important? And also consider your<br/>\ntiming. Are you asking them to help when they are in the middle of something<br/>\nelse? I wouldn&#39;t want to be interrupted when I&#39;m in the middle of something<br/>\nto do something that could wait. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Maisha Khalfani<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 19, 2006 3:24 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] responsibility, discipline, and resentment<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings - <br/>\n<br/>\nhow do you all counter the claims that unschooling doesn&#39;t foster discipline<br/>\nor responsibility or respect? That me doing for my children &quot;too much&quot; will<br/>\ncause them to think that they should be waited on hand and foot? For<br/>\ninstance....after I do the laundry should they put their clothes away or<br/>\nshould I? And if I ask for their help and they say &quot;no&quot; then I have to put<br/>\naway clothes for at least 5-6 individuals. icky for me. Or if I request help<br/>\nin cleaning up the living room, and my daughter (8) or so (7) whine and say<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot; or &quot;do I have to?&quot; and then I clean up their<br/>\ntoys......What do I say when someone says &quot;chores teach them to be<br/>\nresponsible&quot; (that&#39;s usually my husband). I&#39;m not sure what to say because I<br/>\nguess I still believe that, having been raised that way - that the family<br/>\nworks together to keep it going. Right now as I am moving my family into RU,<br/>\nthe only one &quot;working&quot; is me. If I assigned chores the kids would be upset,<br/>\nbut I would have<br/>\nhelp. I feel overwhelmed with it all sometimes. How do I move away from that<br/>\ntype of thinking?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how do I grow and counter my own feelings of resentment because I am<br/>\npicking up and cleaning up after 5 children?

BUT, when I&#39;m tired, or feeling overwhelmed<br/>\nor whatever I just imagine that person NOT being with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can actually shift from a feeling of tiredness to a feeling of<br/>\ngratefulness very quickly that way. I have some of Hannah Jenner&#39;s<br/>\nashes sitting on my bedside table right now. That&#39;s a pretty poignant<br/>\nreminder that I am VERY lucky to have spills to clean up...they&#39;re a<br/>\nsign of healthy, growing, busy children that are learning every day<br/>\nright here with me. I&#39;m so blessed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I grab a rag and say &quot;hey, that spill needs a rag&quot; and the<br/>\nchild WANTS to clean it up. More often than not, I just help my<br/>\nyounger ones because it can feel overwhelming for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":61290046,"authorName":"Maisha Khalfani","from":"Maisha Khalfani &lt;maitai373@...&gt;","profile":"maitai373","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"responsibility, discipline, and resentment","postDate":"1161289464","msgId":18460,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYxMDE5MjAyNDI0LjI2MTQ2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMjA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ4OC5lNmQzMDU1LjMyNWZhNWY2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":18459,"nextInTopic":18464,"prevInTime":18459,"nextInTime":18461,"topicId":18125,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Greetings - how do you all counter the claims that unschooling doesn t foster discipline or responsibility or respect?

That me doing for my children &quot;too much&quot; will cause them to think that they should be waited on hand and foot?  For instance....after I do the laundry should they put their clothes away or should I?  And if I ask for their help and they say &quot;no&quot; then I have to put away clothes for at least 5-6 individuals.  icky for me.  Or if I request help in cleaning up the living room, and my daughter (8) or so (7) whine and say &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot; or &quot;do I have to?&quot;  and then I clean up their toys......What do I say when someone says &quot;chores teach them to be responsible&quot; (that&#39;s usually my husband).  I&#39;m not sure what to say because I guess I still believe that, having been raised that way - that the family works together to keep it going.
