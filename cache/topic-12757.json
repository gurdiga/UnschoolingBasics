My concern is that she may believe that I just don&#39;t<br/>\ncare, but I do care.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t say a bunch of negative stuff about it, because it still<br/>\nmatters to her. That&#39;s ok right now. As you keep pursuing interests,<br/>\nseeing the learning in EVERYTHING, she&#39;ll care less and less about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might point out that she&#39;s learning really cool stuff without it,<br/>\nbut that&#39;s about as far as I&#39;d go. Some kids just like that stuff and<br/>\nI think you&#39;re far enough into trust that she&#39;s not getting the<br/>\nmessage from you that it&#39;s more important than other kinds of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took Sierra and Jalen to the store with me last night because he<br/>\nNEEDED a notebook and pen (nothing around here was &quot;right&quot;) and she<br/>\npicked out a math workbook.  We looked at several K-1 math workbooks<br/>\n(she said &quot;I want an easy one&quot;) that had money/fraction or story<br/>\nproblem type stuff. She didn&#39;t like that. I kept thinking how stupid<br/>\nit was to give kids story problems and fake money on paper when you<br/>\ncould just let them figure it out in real life much better!!<br/>\nShe chose a basic addition/subtraction book. Bought it with her own<br/>\nmoney too (probably got more math out of the transaction than she will<br/>\nout of the book, but ok).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea when or if she will pull it out. It might sit and<br/>\ngather dust like other workbooks we have. But it meant something to<br/>\nher last night, so we have another K-1 workbook. It&#39;s all good if the<br/>\nparent is trusting the learning process and not making schooly stuff<br/>\nthe end-all-be-all in lieu of real life experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12693,"nextTopicId":12746}}
