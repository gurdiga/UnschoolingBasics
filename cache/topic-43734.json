My parents had a hidden agenda (what about you?) in unschooling, that I should get my AA degree. Which really just trumps unschooling in general. So technically, I&#39;m not unschooled.

Which was fine for me, since that was what I wanted to do at the time, and in that year prior, it was not a relevant option for me. I didn&#39;t want to do it, so I didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s realizing he&#39;s not into it, that&#39;s fine. College is hard work.

There&#39;s less than no point going to college if you&#39;re not excited about it. Its a massive waste of time and money. <br/>\n<br/>\nFifteen is young! It may not seem that way to you (or him) but I have a 16yo, and that&#39;s still pretty young ;) There&#39;s no rule that you have to have started college by 18 or you&#39;re some kind of failure. My mother didn&#39;t start college until she was in her mid-twenties and ended up pretty happy with her career choices. I went to college straight from high school and have a degree that I can&#39;t use for anything, not even grad school at this point. Give your guy a chance to learn more about himself - not himself as a student, but as a person. That&#39;s farrrrr more valuable in terms of finding satisfying work and being satisfied with his life in general!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;My plan is to &quot;force&quot; him <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t force anything!

Is there anything else he&#39;d like to do? Travel? Buils a boat in the cellar? Spend six months doing nothing but play video games? Those would all be better than being forced to do anything at all. No-one likes being forced, and its not a good way to learn. In face, its a really really bad way to learn because you learn a whoooooole lot about hate in the process. No-one needs more hate in their life! <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":28011095,"authorName":"MargaretC","from":"&quot;MargaretC&quot; &lt;museec@...&gt;","profile":"margaretc229","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"My 15 year old","postDate":"1271867919","msgId":43734,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhxbjltZit0NTk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43735,"prevInTime":43733,"nextInTime":43735,"topicId":43734,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi - I m looking for support.
