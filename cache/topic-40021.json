We found an amazing deal for a hotel ($40 downtown at a 3<br/>\n1/2 star!) but the parking price is crazy. We have an extra ticket<br/>\ninto the show and were wondering if anyone would like to trade an out<br/>\nof town free parking spot and the ride to and from for the free<br/>\nticket, some free beads and some unschooling fun involving beads,<br/>\njewelry and the business thereof (if desired). We love talking about<br/>\nand showing off our beads.<br/>\n<br/>\nSadly our kids opted to stay home. They are sufficiently bored of long<br/>\ndays at bead shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much if you can help!<br/>\n<br/>\nJean Elizabeth and Esther<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://3mommies.blogspot.com\">http://3mommies.blogspot.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39937,"nextTopicId":40022}}
