They give the exact opposite advise that we would for peaseful parenting. They advocate adversarial relationships with children---especially teens! They strive to provide top-down control in families. Rosemond pushes &quot;vitamin N&quot; (the word NO) as much as possible. <br/>\n <br/>\nThey&#39;re just really lousy advice givers. We suggest you stay as far away from them as possible.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I read your bit on Dobson yesterdy, I groaned that someone was posting Dobson advice. But I liked the part about greeting each other postively each time we meet. It&#39;s a nice start. But we *should* do that and be that person with our families ALL the time.<br/>\n <br/>\nUnfortanately Dobson doesn&#39;t expect you to keep it up all day. He expects you to have to say NO arbitrarily the rest of the day, so this is only a nice way to start.

My rule is that<br/>\nQuentin (age 5) must be in his room usually watching a movie before we watch<br/>\nthese shows. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou already had someone mention the idea of recording your shows - we have a<br/>\nsatellite and it has been a great thing for freeing us from the temporal<br/>\ntyranny of scheduling. We all get to record our shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have never had the mindset that we wanted to send Jayn away from us. Nor<br/>\nhave we had a house that would accommodate such a desire even if we had one!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a long time dh and I used to get our alone time in the mornings before<br/>\nJayn awoke, rather than the traditional in the evening. Now we seem to be on<br/>\ndifferent schedules most of the time. It is sometimes a strain between dh<br/>\nand I, to have less time to talk without interruption. We get around it part<br/>\nof the time by phoning, and by taking the opportunity when Jayn, now 6, is<br/>\nbusy with her own concerns. Mostly we just try to maintain the awareness<br/>\nthat this time is temporary - the tv shows will come again, or end up on<br/>\ndvd.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot as a recommendation but just as a demonstration of what Unschooling can<br/>\nencompass, here is the ongoing saga of our unusual rotating sleep schedule:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; Jayn lives on a 26-28 hour day. She sleeps for close to 10 hours and<br/>\nthen stays awake for 16 - 18. Since the world is rotating once every 24<br/>\nhours, this means we (she and I) are on a permanent slow march around the<br/>\nclock. Sometimes she divides her sleep into two 5 hour sessions on a<br/>\ncompletely unpredictable basis. In our household we are generally over the<br/>\ncourse of a month or 5 weeks spending about a third of that time on a &quot;night<br/>\nshift&quot; when Jayn gets up in the early evening and goes to be after the sun<br/>\nhas risen. Another part of the time she is getting up in the middle of the<br/>\nnight and going to bed in the mid afternoon - this is usually when she will<br/>\ntake a nap and somehow flip around to being on either nights or days. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has never had a set bedtime, and when a toddler simply went to sleep<br/>\nwith us. Dh and I were fortunate in that he was at home after a knee<br/>\nreplacement for the vast majority of her young life, so he and I were able<br/>\nto have our adult together time in the morning. Recently he has returned to<br/>\nwork in the film business, on a varying schedule, so one of the limiting<br/>\nfactors in how I am able to cope with the pushing through to nights is the<br/>\nneed to avoid disturbing his rest. In the past, Jayn has been able to be<br/>\nawake for a couple of extra hours in the bedroom watching tv and asking<br/>\nperiodically for a snack, while I snoozed. Now that dynamic occurs with me<br/>\non the increasingly uncomfortable (as we both age) sofa. [Or I bring a snack<br/>\nbag, similar to our park day food bag, into the bedroom so I don&#39;t have to<br/>\nget up.]<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn is not comfortable being alone and lonely during the nights, so I stay<br/>\nwith her. These quiet, intense times have been the scene of some of our most<br/>\nenriched imaginative games and discussions. They can be wonderful nights. It<br/>\nis only when she does her sudden flips that I have a serious tiredness<br/>\nproblem. When she moves into it gradually, I am able to just follow her,<br/>\nstill usually getting up an hour or so sooner than she awakens. I keep<br/>\nmyself alert by typing on the computer sometimes, when she is engaged with<br/>\nher dolls. Sometimes she watches DVD&#39;s, and there are times when I watch<br/>\nsome other DVD&#39;s on my computer or the portable player at the same time. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing up all night has some restrictions that are not manifest during the<br/>\nday. The first is obviously the need for quiet. Luckily our apartments have<br/>\nwonderfully thick walls, and have all been soundproofed by the Los Angeles<br/>\nAirport Authority. I have to help Jayn avoid jumping games, as we are on the<br/>\nsecond floor. She gets her activity by doing sofa jumping, cycling on the<br/>\nexercise bike, and after the sun comes up. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other restriction is the limited social contact she has during that 10<br/>\n[now more like 6 days] day(night) period. We struggle to get to her just<br/>\nreconvened dance class (1pm on Tuesdays) and the park playdate following.<br/>\nSometimes she is literally getting out of bed to rush to class, at other<br/>\ntimes, about to go to bed as soon as we get home....<br/>\n <br/>\n....It is a fine balance between going places at a certain time and how long<br/>\nthe drive home then is - sometimes a nap during that drive is utterly<br/>\ndisastrous. It only takes 15 minutes of sleeping for Jayn to be refreshed<br/>\nenough for seven more energetic hours, regardless of when she awoke that<br/>\n&quot;morning&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nAwakening her when she doesn&#39;t wish to get up is futile. She has chosen to<br/>\nmiss birthday parties and sleep instead. Trying to manipulate her into<br/>\nsleeping - even with nursing, darkened rooms, quiet time, warm baths, valium<br/>\n(JUST KIDDING!) any kind of trick at all - is equally pointless. She has<br/>\nkept on playing and chatting happily for hours after I would have expected<br/>\ncollapse. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only time that we ever have any kind of emotional conflict or issues<br/>\nbetween us over sleeping, is when I am not being acceptant of Jayn&#39;s<br/>\nschedule. It is true that I am sometimes tired. However I have to choose to<br/>\nnot be resentful or fight her process, or I am tired *and* grumpy. I adapt<br/>\nmy other activities - cleaning, laundry, shopping, errands - around her.<br/>\nThank goodness for 24 hour markets!<br/>\n<br/>\nDh makes time to play with Jayn when he gets home from work [and lots of<br/>\nother times too!]. Again the only times when there are conflicts between us,<br/>\nare when he loses his sense of acceptance about the sleep schedule - if he<br/>\nis feeling lonely or left out. Most of the time he is a miracle of<br/>\nacceptance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the expectation that this is temporary. I have been sometimes<br/>\nreassured by other Unschoolers that this will likely pass. Eventually Jayn<br/>\nmay need fewer sleep hours so her days will regulate back to being 24 hours<br/>\nlong. Also she will gradually become more self sufficient and less needy of<br/>\ncompany or assistance, so in time I will be free to follow my own preference<br/>\nof sleeping, which is to go to bed between midnight and 2am and rise around<br/>\n10-10.30am. (Theater hours) For all I know she will become the same morning<br/>\nperson my dh is. Or she may be a night owl, which is what I suspect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI occasionally talk to her about what she is missing by being awake at night<br/>\ninstead of during the day. She often talks about activities she wants to be<br/>\npart of - such as ice skating or gymnastics. I will have to make sure that<br/>\nthese classes are not early in the morning. Our ability to get to something<br/>\nregularly scheduled before 11am would often be pretty impaired by both my<br/>\ntiredness and her schedule.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI let Jayn know that I am tired and thinking about bed by saying that I<br/>\n&quot;don&#39;t have much left in me - about 10 minutes.&quot; It helps to alert her to<br/>\nthe upcoming transition. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
