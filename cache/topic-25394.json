Mainstream <br/>\nparenting says kids need boundaries, discipline and consequences.  <br/>\nWhat that translates to is kids need limits set by parents and other <br/>\nauthoritarian adults and they need to be disciplined by parents and <br/>\nthey need to endure parent (or other adult) invented punishment.    <br/>\n<br/>\nTo traditional parents boundaries are rules and limits put in place <br/>\nto ensure a child will not do what his parents don&#39;t want.  They <br/>\nbelieve without the rules and limits a child would definitely, <br/>\nwillfully and habitually do wrong things.      <br/>\n<br/>\nTraditional parents believe children need to be disciplined (trained) <br/>\nby adults in order to learn how to be responsible and good.  They <br/>\nbelieve without the external discipline by an adult a child would <br/>\nnever be conscientious.   <br/>\n <br/>\nTraditional parents believe that in order for a child to lean that <br/>\ncertain things are wrong they must suffer some punishment.  Without <br/>\nconsequences traditional parents believe children will strive to find <br/>\nways to &quot;get away with&quot; doing the wrong or bad things they are always <br/>\nsecretly hoping to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents believe kids are nice people who want to do <br/>\nwell.   That changes every interaction with a child.  It eliminates <br/>\nthe need for boundaries, discipline and consequences and makes room <br/>\nfor trust, support and compassion. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the poster was stuck on the issue of saying no to a child, <br/>\nwanting maybe, guidelines for times when &quot;no&quot; is an appropriate <br/>\nresponse in an unschooling family.   <br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Rosemond, who has a weekly column and several books about <br/>\nparenting, maintains a website called &quot;Traditional Parenting.&quot;   From <br/>\nthat website, here is a link to John Rosemond&#39;s bill of rights for <br/>\nchildren:  http://rosemond.com/index.php?action=website-<br/>\nview&WebSiteID=389&WebPageID=9896  where he says a child &quot;has a <br/>\nright&quot; to hear &quot;no&quot; at least three times a day.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe having one&#39;s feelings disregarded by one&#39;s parents <br/>\nbuilds character.  I think it builds resentment.  That&#39;s not the <br/>\nrelationship I&#39;m striving for with my son.   Saying no to someone for <br/>\ntheir own character development is manipulative and patronizing and <br/>\nmean.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think a child should hear &quot;no&quot; as an answer to requests as little <br/>\nas possible.  I think parents should work very hard to find ways to <br/>\nsay yes to children.  I believe people who are new on the planet need <br/>\nto be facilitated in exploration and adventure and investigation as <br/>\nmuch as possible for them to learn and grow happily and be healthy <br/>\nemotionally and mentally.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThinking about times when &quot;no&quot; is appropriate will side track a <br/>\nperson from the creative thought process of trying to find ways to <br/>\nsay &quot;yes.&quot;  I think it&#39;s a sticking point that ought to be got over <br/>\nright quick for unschooling to bloom and grow.   If one has to have a <br/>\nguideline make it to never say &quot;no&quot; automatically or arbitrarily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224687104,"authorName":"j50yab","from":"&quot;j50yab&quot; &lt;ourhome@...&gt;","profile":"j50yab","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling and &quot;No&quot; - Was Snarky Comments and Paintball thread","postDate":"1186256003","msgId":25492,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY5MmthMytpdGczQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY4dmk4OCtkM3FrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25485,"nextInTopic":25494,"prevInTime":25491,"nextInTime":25493,"topicId":25394,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Jennifer - thank you for understanding, it s very much appreciated.

Because he is doing what is <br/>\nnatural, and because you will probably not successfully change his <br/>\nnature and inclination without damage to your relationship, the most <br/>\nreasonable thing for you to do would be to change *your* <br/>\nexpectations for the state of your house while your son is a mud <br/>\nenthusiast.   It is difficult and problematic to try to change <br/>\nsomeone else or to try to get them to meet our expectations.  It is <br/>\nmuch more effective and useful to see what we can change within and <br/>\nabout ourselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since most all of us on this list have at least one kid, and <br/>\nsince it&#39;s not unusual for kids to enjoy mud play or sandbox play, <br/>\nwe all have some concept of the scope of the mud coverage and the <br/>\ntime it takes to clean up.   You might consider whether you&#39;re <br/>\nexaggerating the situation in your own mind and in your language <br/>\nhere in order to justify saying &quot;no&quot; to mud play.   Is it possible <br/>\nthat part of the reason you&#39;re focusing on when an unschooler might <br/>\nsay &quot;no&quot; is because you want to feel ok about sometimes limiting a <br/>\nsecond round of mud play? <br/>\n<br/>\n*** trying to understand the &quot;no&quot;<br/>\nconcept better. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re focusing on when and how and how often to say no when <br/>\nyou should be focusing on finding ways to enrich your child&#39;s life <br/>\nwith you.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Now I&#39;m wondering if it isn&#39;t just a<br/>\nnatural outcome of US rather than the goal in itself? -***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not the goal of unschooling to never say no. There are times <br/>\nwe say no and times we all hear or experience a &quot;no.&quot;   We&#39;re not <br/>\nhoping to convey to our kids that saying no is wrong.  We want our <br/>\nkids to say no to creeps who want to hurt them.<br/>\nBut we should think about each request and situation instead of <br/>\nsaying an automatic &quot;no.&quot;  Consider the possibility of what your <br/>\nchild is asking as you&#39;d consider one of your own desires, or the <br/>\ndesire of a dear friend visiting your home.   Be as helpful and <br/>\nthoughtful with your child as you would be to your friend or your <br/>\npartner.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal is to live well with our children.  To respect them, help <br/>\nthem, and empower them.  The idea is to think about our parenting <br/>\nand make choices that build our relationship with our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents say no for a lot of different reasons.  Lot&#39;s of parents <br/>\nbelieve kids *need* to hear &quot;no.&quot;  They think kids won&#39;t learn <br/>\nwhat &quot;no&quot; means if they don&#39;t make up a lot of reasons to say no.  <br/>\nLots of parent use &quot;no&quot; as the default answer to requests out of <br/>\nconvenience to the parents or some other reason that has nothing <br/>\nreally to do with the workability of the request.  Lots of parents <br/>\noperate on the &quot;Shut them down before they get out of hand&quot; <br/>\nprinciple and unschooling rejects all of that.   Unschooling <br/>\nencourages parents to help their kids do what they want to do as <br/>\nmuch as possible and when it&#39;s not possible to be careful and <br/>\nthoughtful and sympathetic.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I still don&#39;t see the difference between many other parenting <br/>\nstyles<br/>\nand RU***<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you&#39;re looking for the difference.  I think you&#39;re <br/>\nlooking for ways unschooling might be like what you&#39;re doing, so <br/>\nthat you don&#39;t have to really change much in order to think of <br/>\nyourself as an unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is different but until you&#39;re willing to really consider it and <br/>\nconsider why making the changes would be beneficial to your <br/>\nrelationship with your kid you won&#39;t see the difference. <br/>\n<br/>\n***But my son has just turned 7 and<br/>\nyes he does have screaming fits -*** <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that a kid whose folks talked to him about the deck <br/>\nbeing unusable for a little while, whose parents considered how much <br/>\ninconvenience it would be to the kid if they made the deck unusable, <br/>\nwhose mom or dad found another place for chalk play while the deck <br/>\nwas sticky, who maybe even were willing to let the deck go another <br/>\nyear, wouldn&#39;t feel very much like something was done *to* him when <br/>\nthe deck was varnished, wouldn&#39;t feel like something had been taken <br/>\nfrom him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLots of adults have screaming fits.  Some adults still scream when <br/>\nthey feel overwhelmed and as if no one is listening to them or <br/>\ntrying to help them. Kids who&#39;ve been here much less time and who <br/>\nhave fewer skills for coping with stress also especially face a lot <br/>\nof  little disappointments all day long with traditional parents.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s not surprising they sometimes feel stressed to the point of <br/>\ncrying. <br/>\n<br/>\n *** he does respond strongly if hungry or tired, there are<br/>\nother issues ***<br/>\n<br/>\nMany kids and maybe even most little kids are at the mercy of their <br/>\nparents when it comes to getting food.  If parents get busy or <br/>\ndistracted, kids might not get food when they first need it.   There <br/>\nhave been many posts about being proactive when it comes to kids and <br/>\nfood.  Parents can make sure convenient foods are easily available <br/>\nto kids, parents can remember to offer food regularly and they can <br/>\npay attention to their child&#39;s hunger signals so that a kid doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to get to the melt down stage before mom notices he hasn&#39;t <br/>\neaten.   All of those things help a kid feel good immediately, he <br/>\ngets food, he has the considerate attention of his mom and he has <br/>\nchoice.  All of those things can go a long way to help in managing <br/>\nor even avoiding stress. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling and &quot;No&quot; - Was Snarky Comments and Paintball thread","postDate":"1186189759","msgId":25469,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY5MGpqditxcnA2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY4dmk4OCtkM3FrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25465,"nextInTopic":25485,"prevInTime":25468,"nextInTime":25470,"topicId":25394,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~Sometimes I go through periods of focusing too much on the end result of being a totally enlightened RUS mom.~~ I think  that might set you up for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2034499225\">~~Sometimes I go through periods of focusing too much on the<br/>\nend result of being a totally enlightened RUS mom.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nI think  that might set you up for disappointment.

We are relatively new to radical unschooling as well <br/>\n(going on our 2nd year), and I know exactly where you are coming <br/>\nfrom.  When I first started learning about RUS, I looked for specific <br/>\nexamples, trying to get an idea of what it looked like.  I&#39;m just <br/>\nwired that way.  I need specifics and how to steps:)  What I&#39;ve <br/>\nlearned is that the details are much less important than the overall <br/>\npicture.  For me, it&#39;s best that I don&#39;t focus on saying &quot;yes&quot; to <br/>\neverything (however, saying yes as much as possible is a byproduct of <br/>\nliving a RUS life)  or get too wrapped up in if my child does... than <br/>\nI should do... Instead, it&#39;s more helpful to my own journey in RUS <br/>\nthat I stay focused on being present with them in the moment as much <br/>\nas possible (it takes alot of practice, and I&#39;m still working on it:) <br/>\nand quieting my own conventional parental baggage gunk in my head and <br/>\nREALLY watching and listening to my kids.  In learning who they are, <br/>\nI&#39;m able to see their needs behind whatever negative behavoir they <br/>\nare displaying or better yet, I&#39;m able to meet those needs before <br/>\nthere is a problem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that is helpful for me to remember, is that this *is* a <br/>\nprocess (I think it was Meredith and Lisa that mentioned this <br/>\nbefore).

We home school<br/>\nbut are very very new to the idea of unschooling.  However, my son&#39;s<br/>\nfavorite choices of hobby are almost all quite messy, that&#39;s just what<br/>\ninterests him and has since he was about 4 yrs old.  Generally<br/>\nspeaking I do not restrict this, but nevertheless I do find the clear<br/>\nup rounds exasperating (and sometimes draining if I&#39;m having a low<br/>\nenergy level day) as I am repeating the same huge clean up tasks every<br/>\nday or sometimes more.  Often times the clean up lasts longer than the<br/>\ntime it took to make the mess.  My house is not that tidy and not that<br/>\nclean as you cannot have everything - I would rather he has fun doing<br/>\nthat stuff freely than make him sit at a table doing something tidy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mud questions were really around trying to understand the &quot;no&quot;<br/>\nconcept better.  So now I&#39;m wondering if maybe I have a<br/>\nmisunderstanding about US and &quot;no&quot; then?  My impression from websites<br/>\netc was that to try really hard not to say &quot;no&quot; is one of the<br/>\n*objectives* of radical US.  Now I&#39;m wondering if it isn&#39;t just a<br/>\nnatural outcome of US rather than the goal in itself? - which makes a<br/>\nlot more sense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still don&#39;t see the difference between many other parenting styles<br/>\nand RU though in this regard, with the wet deck scenario many non-US<br/>\nfamilies would have given that little extra thought to explaining to<br/>\nthe child as well, so the difference between the different parenting<br/>\nstyles must lie elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould a 6 yr old have a screaming fit?  This was a made up example so,<br/>\nas you say, maybe not the best one.  But my son has just turned 7 and<br/>\nyes he does have screaming fits - where he shouts and dissolves into<br/>\nheavy crying and is very distressed.  I can&#39;t quite gauge whether the<br/>\nloud crying is just his way of letting it all out and that&#39;s that, or<br/>\nwhether there&#39;s more to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately I just can&#39;t think of a real example right now to think<br/>\nabout, but yes, he does respond strongly if hungry or tired, there are<br/>\nother issues (or I wouldn&#39;t be here!!), and maybe it happens when I<br/>\nhave given an inconsistent or unreasonable &quot;no&quot; to something - I just<br/>\ncan&#39;t remember.

Even a very, very little child would<br/>\nunderstand if you took the time to walk over to the freshly varnished<br/>\ndeck, stoop down with child in hand and let them touch a little<br/>\ncorner. Or have the parent touch it and show them. A bit of time and<br/>\nsharing information is all that&#39;s needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a big difference in that scenario, even though the result of<br/>\n&quot;no you can&#39;t walk on the  deck&quot; is the same. In the mainstream world<br/>\n(overgeneralizing here) the answer is just &quot;NO, you&#39;re not allowed&quot;.<br/>\nThe mindful parent is assuming the best of their child and getting<br/>\ndown on their level. Big difference in the affect on the relationship<br/>\neven if the end result is &quot;no&quot;. <br/>\n  <br/>\n~~ Rather than resenting the child and going along, she said no. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know how  Jalen reacted -- maybe he was sad or angry.

I really WANTED to go to the park with<br/>\nhim (this is a downtown park, not really a park at all so no other<br/>\nalternative appealed to him) but between two other family members<br/>\nreally not feeling up to it, there was no way to make it work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo....Jalen was not happy. Not over the top angry or sad like he can<br/>\nbe, probably because he really did understand &quot;sore throat&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;menstrual cycle&quot; in his own way.;) He called me a &quot;jerk&quot; when we got<br/>\nin the van and I just said &quot;You know, it probably feels like I&#39;m a<br/>\njerk because we can&#39;t go to the park right now and you really want to<br/>\nbut I&#39;d really be a jerk if I didn&#39;t take Trevor home when he&#39;s sick.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n~~I want to repeat -- we say yes whenever we can BECAUSE IT MAKES<br/>\nSENSE!  ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, yes, yes!!:) See...it feels GOOD to say yes.

So whe<br/>\nperhaps a difference in how the parents might deal with the  screaming<br/>\nfit child)<br/>\n <br/>\nWell, here&#39;s the problem with hypotheticals. <br/>\n <br/>\nJust like I can&#39;t picture a six year old WANTING to watch porn, I can&#39;t  <br/>\nimagine a child without other issues going on really throwing a screaming fit  <br/>\nbecause they can&#39;t immediately use chalk on a freshly varnished deck. Of course,  <br/>\nthe magic words are &quot;other issues.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nEven little kids aren&#39;t stupid. With a healthy attachment to parents, and a  <br/>\nhistory of being treated with respect, most of the time they can understand  <br/>\nreasonable, real-world limits. You stop them from running into the street,  <br/>\nreminding them that cars are big and fast and can break them. Not stupid -- they  <br/>\ncan get that. The varnish is wet, but we can do it later when it&#39;s dry, or <br/>\nyou  can do it on the sidewalk. Again, not stupid.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf the healthy attached child is throwing a fit because of it, it&#39;s  probably <br/>\nnot about the chalk on the deck. She&#39;s hungry or tired or needs hugs,  or <br/>\nsomething. Maybe it&#39;s just been a hard day. <br/>\n <br/>\nPeople get fixated on the yeses and no&#39;s. We try hard to say yes whenever  we <br/>\ncan because it makes sense. You might have a hard day with a kid where there  <br/>\nare lots of no&#39;s. But even the no&#39;s can be kind and reasonable. Think about <br/>\nhow  you would treat your partner or your best friend. It&#39;s the same thing with <br/>\nyour  child.<br/>\n <br/>\nRen brought up an example with Jalen that I think illustrates an important  <br/>\n&quot;no.&quot; Jalen wanted to do something that Ren was just not physically up to <br/>\ndoing.  Rather than resenting the child and going along, she said no. I don&#39;t know <br/>\nhow  Jalen reacted -- maybe he was sad or angry. It&#39;s okay. Our kids can be <br/>\nsad or  angry sometimes, but a genuine &quot;no&quot; will lead to more trust than a <br/>\nresentful  &quot;yes.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI want to repeat -- we say yes whenever we can BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE!  (caps <br/>\nfor emphasis) Some of the conservative dooky parenting &quot;experts&quot; (I&#39;m  <br/>\nthinking Dobson) insist that you should say no a lot. Why? So kids understand  they <br/>\ncan&#39;t always get what they want?  Again, not stupid -- they know, they  know. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe call this approach radical, but if you think about real relationships,  <br/>\nit&#39;s really not. We just grow up being taught that children are some wild things <br/>\n that have to be broken and controlled. The problem with that is that you end <br/>\nup  with an adult who is broken and doesn&#39;t have any self-control.

Kids having fun are messier.  I think you need to <br/>\ndecide what&#39;s more important.  Is a clean house more important to <br/>\nyou than a happy kid?  If the answer is yes then say no to mud, but <br/>\nconsider that kind of prioritizing isn&#39;t compatible with unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like you need to figure out what it is you believe.   If <br/>\nthe principles of unschooling make logical sense to you then you can <br/>\ntake action to live according to those principles.  If they don&#39;t, <br/>\nthen do something else. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou won&#39;t be the mom of a mud playing child forever.  This time <br/>\nwon&#39;t last, for him or for you.  Let his joy be more important than <br/>\nthe clean floor. On your death bed you will never say, &quot;I wish I&#39;d <br/>\nkept my house cleaner.&quot;  You will say, &quot;I wish I&#39;d played with my <br/>\nkid more.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he&#39;d play in his swim trunks, if the weather is nice enough, <br/>\nand hose off before he comes inside.  <br/>\nMaybe he&#39;d be willing to take his clothes off at the door and hose <br/>\noff. <br/>\nMaybe he&#39;d take his clothes off inside the door and wipe down with a <br/>\ntowel.<br/>\nIf he doesn&#39;t like the cold hose maybe he&#39;d jump in a big  tub of <br/>\nwater before coming in.  You can attach a hose to an indoor spigot <br/>\nfor warm water.<br/>\nMaybe he&#39;d use a camp shower if you hung one outside, they&#39;re nice <br/>\nbecause the sun warms the water a little. <br/>\nMaybe you can put up a little tent with a bucket inside for potty <br/>\nbreaks. <br/>\nMaybe you can get over your worry about mud on washable surfaces. <br/>\nIf you&#39;re too tired to clean up the mud yet again, remember, the mud <br/>\nwill wait for you and in the morning when you&#39;re fresh you can clean <br/>\nit up. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeday you might want his help or understanding about something.  <br/>\nIf he says it&#39;s too much trouble will that be fine with you?  If he <br/>\nlearns that what he wants is just too much bother for you it could <br/>\ndamage your relationship with him.  You&#39;re son&#39;s delight and <br/>\nhappiness today is directly related to his happiness as a teen and <br/>\nas an adult. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is fifteen now but he was four once, and seven once, and nine <br/>\nonce, and twelve.  He played in mud and sand and water.

This isn&#39;t<br/>\nunschooling. Its not what radical unschoolers are trying to express.<br/>\nWhat this describes is parents manipulating children and that&#39;s a<br/>\ndifferent matter.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is, how is what unschoolers do in this situation not<br/>\nmanipulating if traditional but gentle parenting is manipulating?  In<br/>\nboth cases something will come up, the requested thing won&#39;t be<br/>\nallowed, a discussion about options (forget the frowning bit) will<br/>\nfollow, and hopefully an agreeable solution will be reached.  So<br/>\nwhat&#39;s the difference?  You&#39;ll want an example  so let&#39;s say, for<br/>\nexample, you&#39;ve just varnished the deck and it&#39;s still wet, and your<br/>\nchild wants to chalk on it right now.  For both families that just<br/>\nisn&#39;t going to be possible, both will discuss options and in both<br/>\ncases there might be an happier outcome (eg child happily chalks on<br/>\nthe outside wall) or a less happy outcome (child has a screaming fit<br/>\nbecause they really want to do it right now and can&#39;t accept any<br/>\ndiscussion of alternatives).  So where&#39;s the difference? (except<br/>\nperhaps a difference in how the parents might deal with the screaming<br/>\nfit child)<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the difference is in the intentions of the parent?  Isn&#39;t that<br/>\nvery obscure from the child&#39;s point of view? Why does it matter if the<br/>\nconversations and outcomes are the same but the parent has a slightly<br/>\ndifferent slant on it?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe it&#39;s to do with the building of a relationship of trust from<br/>\nthe point of view of the child?  Ie, the traditionally gently parented<br/>\nchild might be aware and begrudge in the discussion that the parents<br/>\nare trying to work round to the child doing something other than what<br/>\nthey want to do.  But with the unschooled child they trust that the<br/>\nparent is trying to work something out sincerely with the child&#39;s<br/>\ninterests at heart?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSee, now I&#39;m lost again because of course the traditional parents will<br/>\nalso have the child&#39;s interests at the heart of their discussions, so<br/>\nwhy would the child see it any differently?  And also, surely the<br/>\nunschooled child, just like the traditionally parented child, will<br/>\nsometimes get mad at the parents because for whatever reason it just<br/>\nisn&#39;t possible for them to do the thing they want when they want to do<br/>\nit eg chalking on the wet deck?<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling and &quot;No&quot; - Was Snarky Comments and Paintball thread","postDate":"1185992983","msgId":25413,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY4cWplbis3cmxwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY4cHEycCsybjcyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25409,"nextInTopic":25414,"prevInTime":25412,"nextInTime":25414,"topicId":25394,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... beach ...

The <br/>\ndifference between radical unschooling and &quot;gentle discipline&quot; <br/>\nthough, is a shift in focus away from the ideas of limits and saying <br/>\nno and *toward* the ideas of facilitation and partnership. Its a <br/>\nconceptual shift that effects the way we interact with our kids on a <br/>\ndaily basis and over the long term. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;... with as much compromise as we (the parents) feel is reasonable <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have certainly made statements like this to conventional parents, <br/>\nbut there&#39;s a significant degree of obfuscation there. Part of the <br/>\nunschooling journey involves stretching the idea of &quot;reasonable&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy school-at-home girlfriend believes its &quot;reasonable&quot; that her 7yo <br/>\nshould obey her promptly since she can never know if what her <br/>\nparents say is urgent. That&#39;s not &quot;reasonable&quot; from an unschooling <br/>\npov. So a statement like the above doesn&#39;t further anyone&#39;s <br/>\nunderstanding of radical unschooling. Its a placating statement, <br/>\nuseful in some social situations, but not a terribly informative <br/>\none. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In my mind I am seeing adults who know that the answer to the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*stated*<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; request is &quot;no&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sometimes the answer *is* no - that 2day drive to the beach, for <br/>\ninstance - but in a sense its not *my* answer, its a statement of <br/>\ngeography. TN is not located near an ocean. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe trouble comes when a parent &quot;knows&quot; the answer is no without <br/>\nreally considering all the possibilities. Automatic or knee-jerk <br/>\nnos. We&#39;re socialized to produce those nos first. That kind of <br/>\nbehavior is modled for us, parents, every time we interact with <br/>\nalmost any other family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a big part of my reluctance to say &quot;of course its okay to say <br/>\nno sometimes&quot;. It takes a lot of practice to say &quot;yes&quot; first. It <br/>\ntakes stopping and thinking Every Time, re-examining each and every <br/>\ndecision, every &quot;no&quot; and &quot;not now&quot;. Until you do that (generic you, <br/>\nnot personal) you don&#39;t realize how few of those limits you&#39;ve <br/>\nreally thought about and how many you&#39;ve swallowed hook, line and <br/>\nsinker, from your own parents and the world around you. When you <br/>\nstart to realize that, its humbling. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes even more time and practice to actively involve childen in <br/>\ndecision making - especially for those of us (true confession, here) <br/>\nwho like to think we&#39;re good at solving problems and coming up with <br/>\nsolutions. It takes a good dose of personal discipline and humility <br/>\nto trust that our kids can come up with ideas every bit as good as <br/>\nour own - even younger kids. Really. It takes time and patience and <br/>\nthe willingness to say &quot;well, I f#ed that up...&quot; - not just in our <br/>\nheads but to our kids - and try again. And again. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;we supervise and interact with our younger kids a lot, and we try<br/>\n&gt; to refuse as little as possible, and when we do set limits, we try <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; do that as humanely as possible, explaining as much a possible, and<br/>\n&gt; and with as much compromise as we (the parents) feel is reasonable <br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; order to support as much of the original intent of the child as<br/>\n&gt; possible, considering the needs and limitations of everyone in the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>family&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest problem with that statement is its not really about <br/>\npeople in relationships, its about behavior.

And I believe that desire to try and meet her<br/>\nneeds makes a difference in my relationship with my<br/>\ndaughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nManisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nLuggage?

Last night, in Asheville we were picking up<br/>\nTrevor from a weekend away (he&#39;s 17). We had planned to walk many<br/>\nblocks up to Pritchard park but Trevor was feeling cruddy with a sore<br/>\nthroat and really wanted to go home right away. Leaving him in the van<br/>\nfor a while wasn&#39;t an option he relished. I was having some physical<br/>\nissues as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo....Jalen had his heart set on going to the park. We explained all<br/>\nthe issues we were dealing with, but he really doesn&#39;t care for the<br/>\nmost part. He tends to get &quot;stuck&quot; on certain ideas and has a very<br/>\ndifficult time transitioning. <br/>\n<br/>\nHad this been an area where we could drive close to  the park, I would<br/>\nhave done that. It&#39;s a many, many block walk with no close parking (we<br/>\nwere lucky to find a spot within three blocks of the original<br/>\ndestination) and it wasn&#39;t going to work for that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, a &quot;no&quot; happened. It does happen. Real life and being sick or<br/>\ntired or not having money or whatever...it happens. But for us, it&#39;s a<br/>\n&quot;no-for-right-this-second&quot; and we&#39;ll find ways to make it work later. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sucked for Jalen and I wish I could have changed it. Unfortunately<br/>\nMY physical issue needed new clothes and NOT walking around.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him how much I wanted to go to the park with him and I was<br/>\nreally sorry it just wasn&#39;t going to work out tonight. I explained<br/>\nthat when we come through again we&#39;ll make sure and go to the park<br/>\nfirst. He&#39;s just not developmentally able to handle changes to plans<br/>\nvery well.....it&#39;s not easy to tell him &quot;no&quot; but it does happen<br/>\noccasionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s life. The point is we try and find ways to adapt so everyone<br/>\ncan get what they need. It doesn&#39;t always work ideally. But the most<br/>\nimportant thing is nobody told him his need for the park was<br/>\nunreasonable. Everyone was sympathetic. He knows we care about his<br/>\ndesires.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67726757,"authorName":"j50yab","from":"&quot;j50yab&quot; &lt;ummhamzah99@...&gt;","profile":"j50yab","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Unschooling and &quot;No&quot; - Was Snarky Comments and Paintball thread","postDate":"1185967001","msgId":25394,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY4cHEycCsybjcyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25396,"prevInTime":25393,"nextInTime":25395,"topicId":25394,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am really fascinated by this comment by one of the posters on another thread.

In fact I was going to ask a related question about<br/>\nit when I came on today.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think most mainstream parents would have less problems with<br/>\nunschooling (even radical unschooling or even &quot;unparenting&quot;) presented<br/>\nas &quot;we supervise and interact with our younger kids a lot, and we try<br/>\nto refuse as little as possible, and when we do set limits, we try to<br/>\ndo that as humanely as possible, explaining as much a possible, and<br/>\nand with as much compromise as we (the parents) feel is reasonable in<br/>\norder to support as much of the original intent of the child as<br/>\npossible, considering the needs and limitations of everyone in the family&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is the difference (if any) between &quot;unschooling&quot; and what the<br/>\nposter says above?  There was an example I think in one of the threads<br/>\nabout a little girl who wanted to go to the beach *now* when the beach<br/>\nis 2 days away.  In my own home my son wanted to go out yesterday to a<br/>\nmuseum across town (on foot) after we had done errands and when he and<br/>\nI would be too tired and museum would only be open for about 15<br/>\nminutes when we got there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my mind I am seeing adults who know that the answer to the *stated*<br/>\nrequest is &quot;no&quot;.  Yes there can be examination and reflection on what<br/>\nare the child&#39;s needs/desires/feelings/unstated requests and<br/>\nsuggestions of alternatives etc which may or may not be agreeable to<br/>\nthe child. And as mentioned by the poster I have quoted at the top,<br/>\nthis can all be done honorably, respectfully etc until child&#39;s needs<br/>\n(as best as we can discern them) are met to the best of our ability -<br/>\nwith the child&#39;s wishes/development etc at the heart of discussion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut isn&#39;t this still an unstated &quot;no&quot; to the original request? Thank<br/>\nyou for helping me to understand this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25713,"nextTopicId":25079}}
