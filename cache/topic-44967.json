We had understood from an interaction last night in which <br/>\nCharlie had become more and more frustrated with our inability to <br/>\nunderstand what was going on for him. On reflection we began to <br/>\nunderstand his need for us to do the work to understand him and his <br/>\nneeds, rather than an expectation that he should have the tools to <br/>\ncommunicate and manage the situation. After doing so much therapy I <br/>\nrecognize the need to have someone understand my needs and meet them <br/>\nwithout me asking, which was left over from the unmet needs of my own <br/>\nchildhood. I&#39;m hoping that I will handle this differently than my mother <br/>\nhandled this, and listen and learn...and make the changes I need to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are trying to provide lots of opportunities where he can feel in <br/>\n&#39;control&#39;, I think that he needs to feel &#39;supported&#39; alot right now, to <br/>\nhave his needs met and his vulnerability accepted, spends a lot of time <br/>\nsat on my knee, wants me to get him things food, be showing that he is <br/>\nstill dependent and wants us to meet his needs. He has started to <br/>\ncommunicate in non verbal ways, he has also started to want to have <br/>\nbaths with me again. I think he needs to be indulged and I&#39;m working at <br/>\ndoing that altho I sometimes feel controlled, I&#39;m able to hold onto this <br/>\nknowledge that this is helpful for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is very keen on fairness and equality, which is fair enough and <br/>\ncomplains loudly if we fall back into double standards. When I say <br/>\nintense i mostly mean becoming &#39;shouty&#39;, &#39;name calling&#39;, I do feel he is <br/>\nscared by some of the strong reactions(feelings) he is experiencing now <br/>\n(as they are not controlled externally by threats of punishment) he has <br/>\ntried to hit me and I have held my boundaries...(he knows that he has <br/>\ncontrol and could hit without the fear of punishment) I offered him the <br/>\nchoice to continue to hit me....(not sure if this is a great way to deal <br/>\nwith it? but it worked) he stopped immediately when he realised he had <br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmongst all this complexity in our journey, I would also like to <br/>\nacknowledge how lovely, kind, empathic and gentle Charlie is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the support, it has really helped me to value our &#39;real&#39; <br/>\njourney together, and I love it.<br/>\nAll good wishes Tori<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nplaidpanties666 wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tori Otero &lt;tori.otero@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;We are finding it a struggle as his expression has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; become louder and more intense, (I feel that he is testing our resolve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and asking whether he really has freedom and choice)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sure, he wants to know if you&#39;re &quot;serious&quot; - and he wants to know just <br/>\n&gt; how much safety he has to express things that are important to him. <br/>\n&gt; How much can he trust you?

Rather than looking for specifics it could be better to simply read with that in mind, see who else has similar questions and issues to yours. Lots of people run into issues of control, for instance, in a whooooole lot of different ways - the thread about belly-button piercing just as much as a thread about television or food or &quot;getting out of the house&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have this fantasy of us exploring life together, living  <br/>\n&gt; and working together, being on a journey together. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found it helpful, over the years, to invite those fantasies in for a cup of tea and then say goodbye to them- grieve a little for the loss of my fantasy life with my fantasy kids and then refocus on my real family. <br/>\n<br/>\nStepping away from the fantasy, you&#39;re already doing those things - they just don&#39;t look quite the way you&#39;d imagined. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 17)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":359116515,"authorName":"Tori Otero","from":"Tori Otero &lt;tori.otero@...&gt;","profile":"toriotero2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"New here and new to &#39;unschooling&#39;","postDate":"1287314529","msgId":44967,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRDQkFEQzYxLjgwNzA1MDZAbnRsd29ybGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44968,"prevInTime":44966,"nextInTime":44968,"topicId":44967,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello to everyone My names Tori, I live in Manchester uk with my partner Matt and two of my (our) three sons, Luciano who is almost 17 and Charlie who is six.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-39739474\">Hello to everyone<br/>\n<br/>\nMy names Tori, I live in Manchester uk with my partner Matt and two of <br/>\nmy (our) three sons, Luciano who is almost 17 and Charlie who is six. My <br/>\nother son Fabrizio is 13 and lives with his dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe began Homeschooling Charlie back in Febuary this year. Initially we <br/>\nthought it important to to take advice to deschool and we also resisted <br/>\nmaking contact with other HE&#39;s as we wanted to find our own way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had read some of John Holts work and especially liked A S Neill&#39;s <br/>\neducational philosophy and visited Summerhill twice. Myself and my <br/>\npartner had both lived in a democratic community and both feel strongly <br/>\nthat children are able to make decisions and choices that are right for <br/>\nthem and that we are their to support them when needed. We also <br/>\nacknowledged that we have been brought up in families and a society (in <br/>\nwhich we still live) that  doesn&#39;t support this way of living. We knew <br/>\nit was about sitting back and managing our anxieties, saying and doing <br/>\nless.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell thats the theory over with.....now for the reality.....back in Feb <br/>\nwe tried being more laid back, not restricting TV, or controlling food, <br/>\ntho we still had managed bedtimes and managed our timetable. We <br/>\nexperimented with differing levels of autonomy....very much dependent on <br/>\nhow much anxiety we could manage (how well we did at silencing the voice <br/>\nin our heads that said we we&#39;re being neglectful), things we&#39;re going <br/>\nwell, Charlie seemed happy and content painting and playing with his <br/>\nfigures in the garage or playing with lego. He would move between <br/>\ndifferent interests, these intense experiences lasting for a couple of <br/>\nweeks. About four weeks ago we lifted  decided to embrace the <br/>\n&#39;unschooling&#39; philosophy, we lifted and are committed to no restrictions <br/>\nwith TV, Food and bedtimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie seems to have embraced his freedom, and lets us know when we <br/>\ndon&#39;t get it right. We are finding it a struggle as his expression has <br/>\nbecome louder and more intense, (I feel that he is testing our resolve <br/>\nand asking whether he really has freedom and choice), we are learning <br/>\nloads about each other and ourselves....Charlie doesn&#39;t want to go out <br/>\nvery much at all, I try suggesting different activities I think he may <br/>\nlike, ....I think he needs to be in control at the moment and there is <br/>\nno room to negotiate....I know that he has the language and the <br/>\nunderstanding and I&#39;m trying hard not to see his behaviour and <br/>\nresistance as pathological (I come from a psychology background) but as <br/>\nhim being assertive, so I&#39;ve backed off, and we are committed to not <br/>\nforcing him to go out for his &#39;own good&#39; I have done quite a lot of <br/>\nreading but there is very little about how children have found the <br/>\ntransition between the different ways of living and working. Obviously <br/>\neach child is an individual and I suppose I&#39;m looking for some <br/>\nreasurrance. I have this fantasy of us exploring life together, living  <br/>\nand working together, being on a journey together. I don&#39;t expect this <br/>\nto be conflict free, but selfishly and impatiently I want it sooner, (I <br/>\nrealise that I should drop this expectation and go with the flow more).<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the lengthy post and thanks to anyone who takes time to read it<br/>\nxxxx Tori xx</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44338,"nextTopicId":44985}}
