I hear you thinking: My kid had gone crazy!  He&#39;s a motorcycle maniac.  He doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s really asking for!!  He&#39;s gonna die!!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, judgement masks fear.  You may have a pile of fear you need to unload about motorcylces before you can work together with your son towards his dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps me to figure out how realistic my fears are.  Like when I let go of the fear &quot;TV is bad and Violent Video games are worse.&quot;  I read a lot about TV and video games and violence.  I discovered that many people learn lots of positive skills via video games.  Since I&#39;ve let go of my fears I&#39;ve been able to enjoy my son and his passion for video games.  I&#39;ve watch with pleasure as his leadership skills improve and his communication skills grow.  I&#39;ve been able to watch my daughter as she explores acting, directing, theatre, relationships, etc. through TV.  Cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also helps me to keep things good with my kids if I unload my fears before I talk to them.  Maybe talking to hubby about fears.  Definitely writing to un-schooling folks about my fears.  Sometimes just writing down, &quot;I am afraid...&quot; and filling in the blank gets those fears out of my head and on to paper where I can deal with them.  I am afraid he will hurt his head, so I get a helmut.  I am afraid he will ride before he knows what to do, so I get him a mentor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest getting those fears out and on the table where you can deal with them.  Then, go back to your son and find a way to help him get what he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\n<br/>\nElli</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141243160,"authorName":"Kathryn","from":"&quot;Kathryn&quot; &lt;kathryndubay@...&gt;","profile":"observeandlearn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: 11 yo, motorcycle, and creativity","postDate":"1275219039","msgId":44328,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh0dGk4ditsa2EwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEM4MjY5QTk1LjE4NTREJXpvYWNvbm5lckBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":44326,"nextInTopic":44329,"prevInTime":44327,"nextInTime":44329,"topicId":44322,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... == My normally lovey 11 yo son has decided that he really want us to buy him a motorcycle and is angry as all hell that we have not done so  yet. == Hi","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-478926248\"><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Zoa Conner &lt;zoaconner@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n== My normally lovey 11 yo son has decided that he really want us to buy him a motorcycle and is angry as all hell that we have not done so  yet. ==<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Zoa,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son too (5) is dearly passionate about and wanting a motorbike.  It&#39;s been an interesting journey for myself, exploring/contacting local council, etc, to determine where/when people can ride dirtbikes.  It&#39;s Not supported well here in this corner of the world; the noise can be an issue for residence.  Fair enough.  He doesn&#39;t care about the details.  He just wants to ride NOW!  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor now, what seems to have fed his passion (without the actual dirtbike!) is DVD&#39;s of motorcross stuff.  Check out Crusty Demons; my ds LOVES it!  But first and foremost are his video games.  He has a few that are his favourite, where he choses the bike/rider/track, etc.  I wander if your son has &#39;parallel&#39; type passions -- scooters, BMX, skateboard, etc.  Jude does, and we do lots of trips out and about to local skate parks with bike/scooter in tow where he can do his thing and increase his skills/creativity.  To me, all this seems &#39;transitional&#39; to his ultimate goal of owning/riding a dirtbike.

We are at<br/>\nam impass and I could use some fresh ideas. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of the things that you have discussed are legal matters. Did you encourage him to do the research to verify the laws in your state? Whenever my daughter wants to do something (doesn&#39;t matter what it is) that I am uncomfortable with, we research it together or I have her do the research to help me be comfortable with it. What are your reasons for not doing it? Are you uncomfortable with the idea and trying to find ways to avoid it? Is it a monetary thing? What are your fears and concerns? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-- finding somewhere to try a motorcycle or dirt bike since he has never<br/>\n </span></blockquote>been on one&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you gone to any of the local motorcycle shops? I would recommend going to a shop and talking to a shop owner about the legalities involved in owning a motorcycle or dirt bike in your area. They would also probably know where a race track is. I have a friend whose son started racing dirt bikes/motorcycles when his son was 4 or 5. Here is a link to a quick guide for dirt bikes: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dirtbikekids.com/\">http://www.dirtbikekids.com/</a>  You might also consider finding go kart tracks. Go karts are pretty fun and let you go fast. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-- the option of driving &quot;something&quot; on our friends&#39; farms (said no since he<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wants to go fast)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe motorcross tracks and courses that are available in a lot of places would be much better than a friends farm because it would allow him to go fast. If you could find one of those tracks somewhere in your area, you might be able to contact them for ways that your son could try out a motorcycle to see if he really likes it or if he just likes the idea of it. I think there are classes and stuff that are offered. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-- how we would come up with the money for a motorcycle and gas for it&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does he get an allowance or have any kind of way to earn money? When my daughter wanted a nintendo DS, we talked about not being able to afford it. Our solution was for her to help save the money by doing extra work around the house. She also remembered that she always gets lots of money for her birthday from family members. For her birthday, we put our money with her birthday money and the money she had been saving and got her the DS as well as games and accessories. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He says I am killing his dream by not getting him a motorcycle right now.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Those words hurt me, but I seem to be having problems finding more ways to<br/>\napproach this situation.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you could tell him yes now and start moving towards buying the motorcycle by checking out some local tracks and shopping at some of the local mini bike places. We usually have a research and discovery period where do things related to the item that my kids want to purchase. Does he have any idea how much bikes run? Does he have any idea of what type of bike he actually wants?

Here are things we have<br/>\ndiscussed:<br/>\n<br/>\n-- where he can ride it (he thinks that our neighborhood road is acceptable<br/>\neven though it is a county maintained road so we disagree)<br/>\n-- the age requirements for a driver&#39;s license to ride on &quot;real&quot; roads<br/>\n-- whether a &quot;pocket bike&quot;, which he considers a &quot;toy&quot;, counts as a motor<br/>\nvehicle requiring licensure and registration<br/>\n-- finding somewhere to try a motorcycle or dirt bike since he has never<br/>\nbeen on one<br/>\n-- the option of driving &quot;something&quot; on our friends&#39; farms (said no since he<br/>\nwants to go fast)<br/>\n-- how we would come up with the money for a motorcycle and gas for it<br/>\n<br/>\nHe says I am killing his dream by not getting him a motorcycle right now.<br/>\nThose words hurt me, but I seem to be having problems finding more ways to<br/>\napproach this situation.<br/>\n----------------<br/>\nZoa Conner, PhD<br/>\nPhysicist and Organic Learning Mother<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zoaconner@...\">zoaconner@...</a><br/>\n*Scintillating Science or Marvelous Math Days: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ssommd.blogspot.com\">http://ssommd.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n*Handmade stuff @ <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://earthyzee.etsy.com\">http://earthyzee.etsy.com</a><br/>\n*LaPlata Area Food Delivery @ <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://laplata-area-food.blogspot.com\">http://laplata-area-food.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://zzz-organic.blogspot.com\">http://zzz-organic.blogspot.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44331,"nextTopicId":44334}}
