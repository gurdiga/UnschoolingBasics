Certain kinds of clothes too - and don&#39;t even get me started with hair! I&#39;m so glad other unschooling girls have &quot;hair wads&quot;. And she&#39;s very much an introvert. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Emotional sensitivity. Lots here, no TV in this house (ds is only child left at home) the news is devastating, programmes that humiliate people, or abandon them on Islands, or where people are not nice to each other upset him for days. He prefers not to go there. He also doesn&#39;t want to know what is going on in the world, social studies type lessons when he was at school are devastating.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nMorgan is similar and we learned early to avoid any of that kind of programming around her. Happily, no-one else in our family really likes that kind of thing, so it wasn&#39;t a big deal, and she never had to deal with school. We did learn early on not to offer any &quot;live action&quot; movies without pre-screening for emotional violence, but then we also gave her the option of watching things if she wanted. She was able to develop some strategies of her own for dealing with the glop to get to the good stuff, as it were. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be that your guy&#39;s strategy is simply avoidance. Is he okay with that for now? Does he have opportunities to make other choices, develop other strategies? or do you simply censor based on his known triggers? You might be able to help him expand that, if he wants, set him up for more choices. Its just as possible, though, that he really really knows his limits and avoidance is his best bet. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else I wonder is that, with others in the house, did he have to make an effort to avoid things he didn&#39;t want to see in the past? That might have been stressful enough that he didn&#39;t get a chance to develop other strategies. It may be, now that he has time without other family members around, that he&#39;ll start to expand his options naturally. That&#39;s something I&#39;ve seen my 16yo do in other areas, not sensitivty per se. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The problem comes with other people, and now even family, this Christmas even his older sibling have been on his case. &quot;How long are you going to pander to him? He&#39;s 13 years old!&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************************<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you use any lables to describe him, beyond &quot;Highly sensitive&quot;? Sometimes it can be useful to have something like that to get people off your back. If he were in a wheelchair, no-one would question the ramp to your front door! I mostly rely on humor and deflection, personally. My favorite (and I&#39;m careful where I use it) is to say &quot;oh, she just doesn&#39;t like humans&quot;. In the right crowd, its met with humorous commiseration &quot;oh, yeah, me neither, LOL.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;Its what comes of homeschooling! Send him to school!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I get that sometimes with Morgan. I&#39;m very confident, though, when I tell people I&#39;ve researched the matter thoroughly and am certain school would be the worst place for her. I have, and it would! And anyone who has gone to the trouble to research the benefits of home education for themselves is welcome to debate the matter with me. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He&#39;s fine actually, as long as we respect his need for quiet space, but he is lonely. All the kids we know his age have mobile phones (he cannot tolerate them) play computer games and watch TV.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes he want friends his own age? Ray doesn&#39;t - he wants adult friends. He has very little in common with other teenagers unless they&#39;re unschoolers. Both my kids meet people through their interests more than by age. Some of Mo&#39;s interests are still &quot;age based&quot; in the sense that kids are more likely to be into Bakugan and Spongebob video games than adults, but its still a matter of interest. She sometimes says she&#39;d like more girl friends, for instance, but has little in common with local girls (unschoolers are a different matter) so most of her local friends are boys. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes he want a cell phone? to play video games? to watch more tv? If he does, look for more strategies and options that allow him to do that, or something close. But if he&#39;s just looking to connect, help him find more ways to connect via the things he enjoys already. Look into lego clubs and leagues, book clubs, SCA, sailing clubs, groups for surfers. In the real world, outside the hothouse of school, people meet by means of interests - your peers are the people who do and like the things you do and like. So help him make friends the way adults make friends, by connecting with his real peers, not his age-peers. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The big thing is he wants really badly to be in a play. There is one coming up but it means auditions (some people will be upset) and, if he gets in, noisy rehearsals, and lots of people. The show will include bright lights and amplified sound. Would you let him do this?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you talked to him about all of this? What kinds of strategies does he think will help him cope? That&#39;s an important question. In between &quot;wanting to&quot; and &quot;being able to&quot; are the strategies. He&#39;s going to need some in order to function in that kind of environment. Help him work out some ideas and then, if he&#39;s still interested, take him to the audition! If there&#39;s time before then, take him to some rehearsals of other shows, or ask for a tour of the theater - any theater that will accomodate you, doesn&#39;t have to be the same one - and chat with the technical staff. Maybe set up a practice stage at home with lights and speakers so he can experience those aspects and develop strategies for dealing with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he balks at the audition, look into the possibility of becomming part of the crew. That&#39;s a good way for him to learn, first hand, what all the possible trouble spots are. Its also a good way for him to meet people who share an interest! And theater people are wonderfully quirky and have a host of strategies for dealing with fears and sensitivities. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;What about the other people in the play if he gets in and later cannot cope?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>********************<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he gets in, ask him how he&#39;d like to deal with this, make a plan. It may mean talking to the director and making sure an understudy is ready to go at a moment&#39;s notice. It may mean re-casting him in a smaller role, or simply as a background character in a group scene. It may mean he switches to &quot;crew&quot; rather than &quot;cast&quot; for that show, to be sure he can handle the environment before actually being in the spotlight. It may mean giving him space to try his wings a little and hoping for the best! <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":256450034,"authorName":"riverkatie","from":"&quot;riverkatie&quot; &lt;riverkatie@...&gt;","profile":"riverkatie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Highly sensitive children","postDate":"1261764908","msgId":42571,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhoMnZmYyt2cDI4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":42572,"prevInTime":42570,"nextInTime":42572,"topicId":42571,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Does anyone have one of these?

In practical terms this means (for him, obviously all sensitive people are different!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOral sensitivity. Cannot eat certain foods eg cooked vegetables, or things in sauce, or jelly.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoise sensitivity, cannot go to a movie theatre, Museum ultra sonic alarms mean we have to leave. A shame as he loves museums. We are going to try again with ear plugs!<br/>\n<br/>\nPhysical sensitivity, a pat feels like a blow, can only wear certain clothing items,  socks seem to be a form of torture.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmotional sensitivity. Lots here, no TV in this house (ds is only child left at home) the news is devastating, programmes that humiliate people, or abandon them on Islands, or where people are not nice to each other upset him for days. He prefers not to go there. He also doesn&#39;t want to know what is going on in the world, social studies type lessons when he was at school are devastating.<br/>\nHe cannot play computer games involving violence etc. We do watch carefully selected DVDs on the computer. They have a lovely feature where we can preview scenes and work out if it is likely to be OK for ds.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeeds lots of time alone. As we were a family of 5 living in a 4 room house, this was a real problem, until he and dh built a tree house for him, now so long as the weather is OK he can escape. He is &#39;safe&#39; up there. No-one is allowed to climb the tree if he is in it. (is this controlling? Reading it now, it reads as controlling but he needs this for his mental health) Things are generally better now the older children have left home and he has a bedroom to himself, and a door he can shut (he had a curtain before)<br/>\n<br/>\nCannot cope with team sports or competitive games. He surfs and sails.<br/>\n<br/>\nFear of the dark. Many other fears rational only to him<br/>\n<br/>\nDifficulty with transitions from one sate to another, eg sleep to waking, waking to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll stop here, I&#39;m sure you get the idea!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem comes with other people, and now even family, this Christmas even his older sibling have been on his case. &quot;How long are you going to pander to him? He&#39;s 13 years old!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;He&#39;s going to have to get a grip, how is he going to cope in the real world?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Its what comes of homeschooling! Send him to school!&quot; (He came out because at the age of 8 he was still screaming and clinging to me and doorways in an attempt not to go to school. He learnt nothing there, could not read, spell, add up, it was too noisy, people were too unkind etc etc. he was incapacitated.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s fine actually, as long as we respect his need for quiet space, but he is lonely. All the kids we know his age have mobile phones (he cannot tolerate them) play computer games and watch TV. He is a gifted artist, who loves to read, lego, and ironically, research history as long as nobody expects him to look at the 20th century.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big thing is he wants really badly to be in a play. There is one coming up but it means auditions (some people will be upset) and, if he gets in, noisy rehearsals, and lots of people. The show will include bright lights and amplified sound. Would you let him do this? What about the other people in the play if he gets in and later cannot cope?<br/>\n<br/>\nToo long, sorry. And thank you if you managed to read this far! Any advice on sensitive teenagers, plays and auditions and interfering relatives gratefully accepted!<br/>\n<br/>\nKatie.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42549,"nextTopicId":42581}}
