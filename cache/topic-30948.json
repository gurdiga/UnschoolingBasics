I agree it is for experimentation and a perfect example of why I say humans are born uncivilized. In your original post you were asking how to handle yourself in this situation eh? I would say for you to convince yourself that this behaviour is natural and to expect it. It really sounds as if you do expect it but somehow got caught off guard when she shifted her behaviour to kicking. I sincerely believe my son would also be a biter in day care had I kept him there because he tries to bite us all the time. He also tries to capture the cats when he sees them, and yes he tries to pinch and pull their hair. The cats are able to handle themselves and I do not have to intervene at all, but if he could catch the dogs I&#39;m sure I would have to intervene, but I am like you, I would not re-home my dogs nor even consider it, I would simply stay diligent in intervening that<br/>\n way I&#39;m never caught off guard thus not losing it. Now someone here has already told you that occasionally losing it will not cause harm, I agree because it is a natural result of being afflicted with emotions and your kids will understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Karen Swanay &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:luvbullbreeds@...\">luvbullbreeds@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 18, 2008 7:32:31 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Do you ever get really mad? aka I blew it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, by pulling his ears.

I *LOST* it.  I can handle<br/>\nher breaking things, or throwing tantrums (which she really doesn&#39;t do<br/>\nshe just lets me know she&#39;s frustrated.)  But my pets...I just can&#39;t<br/>\nhandle animal abuse.  And yeah I know she doesn&#39;t understand the<br/>\nconcept of abuse.  But in the moment...what should I do?  Because I<br/>\njust yelled at her very loudly.  I was so mad.  My husband just took<br/>\nher for a walk and I vacuumed the house which helps calm me down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I blew it.  I need some tool to help me with the pets.  This is<br/>\nthe one thing I can&#39;t just giggle about and say &quot;Oh well!  She&#39;ll<br/>\nlearn!&quot;  And NO I&#39;m not rehoming my pets.  That&#39;s a no go option.  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot asking for how to keep her from doing this, because it&#39;s pretty<br/>\ninfrequent and I know as she gains more understanding it will stop.<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m asking for is what do *I* do in the moment, what&#39;s the<br/>\noverride button?  My pets are as important to me as she is.  I take<br/>\npet ownership seriously.  So this is like my other big<br/>\nconundrum...when the boys are fighting and they are hurting each other<br/>\neither physically or verbally.  I feel like so much of this<br/>\nunschooling stuff would be seamless with just one kid but, I stumble<br/>\nover these kinds of conflicts and I SO blew it just now.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren *feeling like a bad person but would like no one to tell me I&#39;m<br/>\na bad person I feel bad enough about this already.*<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, I probably would have done the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I would have taken that breath---*after* the fact. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking on a three year old is so completely different than starting as <br/>\nan infant. There&#39;s a reason we naturally get them when they don&#39;t DO <br/>\nmuch of anything: so we can grow WITH them to make changes that will <br/>\nmake life easier as we all grow. &lt;G&gt; Suddenly having a three year old <br/>\nisn&#39;t easy! And a three year old with little to no empathy is even <br/>\ntougher.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would keep the animals separated from her for a while. Baby gates are <br/>\nhelpful. Only have the dogs with her when you are RIGHT there where you <br/>\ncan control the situation. She certainly shouldn&#39;t be left alone with <br/>\nthem unsupervised for a long, long while.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a while, she&#39;ll learn *how* to treat the animals. The problem is <br/>\nthat she&#39;s had NO experience with animals. And the experience she&#39;s had <br/>\nwith humans has been spotty, at best. But she needs more time watching <br/>\n*you* and your boys interact with the dogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that, although *we* consider it abuse, she was just seeing <br/>\nwhat would happen if she kicked the dog. Had she been *born* to you, <br/>\nshe would have had months and months of seeing proper treatment of dogs <br/>\nbefore she could ever even *walk*! I doubt it was malicious; it was <br/>\nprobably just an experiment! &quot;What happens if I do THIS?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the big scheme of things, a little yelling will NOT scar her. It may <br/>\nhave made a huge impression though---especially of that&#39;s not the norm <br/>\naround your house. When I yell now (NOT several years ago before <br/>\nunschooling!), it&#39;s a damned big deal---and everyone knows I&#39;m upset <br/>\nand out of control---so they take it seriously. In a home where yelling <br/>\nand hitting *are* normal, then yelling and hitting are ---just that: <br/>\nNormal---and nothing to get upset about (that didn&#39;t some out quite <br/>\nright, but it&#39;s not seen as OHMYGODMOMISOUTOFCONTROL!). I know a lot of <br/>\nkids who just &quot;tune out&quot; the yelling. They don&#39;t even notice it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI essentially HAVE one kid(s) (eight years apart), so I *can* <br/>\nconcentrate on one at a time. So I&#39;m worthless in helping you figure <br/>\nout what to do with multiples. &lt;g&gt; But I *do* know all about crates as <br/>\nsafe havens for dogs! The dogs should not be in range of a hitting <br/>\ntoddler. I just put mine up if I think a guest child will not be able <br/>\nto restrain himself. I&#39;m sure the dogs and cats appreciate it---even if <br/>\nthey don&#39;t know why. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t look at this as the end of the world. Look at it as a <br/>\n*learning-take* for both you and Morgan. She learned that you go <br/>\nballistic if she kicks the dog (that could be good OR bad, depending!). <br/>\nYou learned that she is interested in interacting with dogs---and not <br/>\nalways well. You learned not to leave her alone with (or at least <br/>\nwithin kicking distance of) the dog. You learned that it freaks you out <br/>\nmore than you thought. *Knowing* that, you can make adjustments as they <br/>\ncome up again (and I&#39;m sure they will! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep them separated unless you can be *right* there. The good thing is <br/>\nthat she will probably catch on sooner because she *is* older and she <br/>\nsees gentleness modeled *for* her.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut don&#39;t beat yourself up. You&#39;ve learned some good things! &lt;G&gt; Now <br/>\nyou can do better next time.
