So, if we drop speech therapy, he is going<br/>\nto continue to experience the frustration of potential<br/>\nfriends quite literally turning their backs on him.  He <br/>\nis delightfully funny and personable, so this is really sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe therapy is focused on the sounds he can make.  <br/>\nThe SLP is guiding DS to notice whether air is coming<br/>\nout of his nose or out of his mouth.  They are also<br/>\nworking on learning to close the palate.  That is a big<br/>\nchallenge, but the first step to making most consonant<br/>\nsounds. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;work&quot; is all very playful:  they paint their palates<br/>\nwith blue popsicles--the SLP does the activities alongside<br/>\nDS--and then look in the mirror with a flashlight to see<br/>\ntheir palates opening and closing.  They make sounds<br/>\ninto a mic connected to a computer so that DS can see<br/>\non the screen when he is (and when he isn&#39;t) making <br/>\nglottal stops.  They talk with a tube over the nose<br/>\nand the other end held to the ear, again to distinguish<br/>\noral from nasal sounds.  It is all very playful and low<br/>\nkey, but DS is a smart kid; he knows it is work.  And<br/>\nI&#39;m sure he&#39;s afraid to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Karen said, our kids have had rough starts to life.<br/>\nThis particular son told me that adults hit him in China.<br/>\nHe demonstrated placing a closed fist to his cheek.  Yes,<br/>\nhe was punched in the face by caretakers.  Another son,<br/>\nfrom a different orphanage, a different province, was talking<br/>\nto me last night about death.  (My MIL is terminally ill.)<br/>\nHe told me that sick kids are left alone to die, and then <br/>\nleft until whenever &quot;a big truck&quot; comes to collect the corpses.<br/>\nHe talked about how &quot;worms eat dead babies&#39; eyes.&quot;<br/>\nSorry to be so graphic, but it is important to understand<br/>\nthat for these kids to show any weakness, to admit<br/>\nany vulnerability...<br/>\n<br/>\n...that feels like a death threat.  Because where they came<br/>\nfrom, weakness and vulnerability actually could lead to<br/>\ndeath.  It was a very brutal, survival of the fittest beginning<br/>\nto life.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, I&#39;ve tried to explain this to the SLP, but<br/>\nmaybe I need to have the talk again, and be just<br/>\nas explicit as I have been here, so that she understands<br/>\nhis resistance to the therapy.  I&#39;m not sure there is anything<br/>\nI can say to get her to understand my resistance to the <br/>\ntoken economy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate the thoughts about ASL, but the goal really<br/>\nis to be understood by other people in general.

Here I go again. <br/>\nI am a speech path but I am also a mother of 4 kids (two who were adopted at the ages of 2 and 5) and also have kids with speech issue (not as severe as yours however).<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonnally, I dont believe speech therapy as you describe it is doing anything but aggrevate your son and will not help in the long run, but might actually hurt things, because his attitude toward it will be bitter but his speech will not improve unless he wants it to and is willing to work toward it.  It is like trying to teach a child to read, who has not interest in reading and perhaps isnt even ready to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son is able to talk to you about what might make the therapy more bearable, I would start by discussing that with him.  Perhaps he would do the exercises with you but not the therapist. (the therapist can show you what to look for and how to do them)  Perhaps having siblings involved, things like that.  I dont know your therapist but I ask parents about what motivates their kids not to set up a token system but to have more activities centered around their interests so that they are more likely to want to participate.  Approaching that with her might help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes down to it though, thinking about your sons communication not as speech but as a whole system is important.  Expanding all is his modes of communication, be is spoken language, signs, pictures, written words, hand gestures etc..  even if he continues in therapy right now, it will be years before he is through and in the meantime he needs to be able to communicate.  It is all about giving him the tools and helping him learn to use them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps or gives you any ideas.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"Karen Swanay &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Speech Therapy Frustration","postDate":"1238069557","msgId":39113,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDkwMzI2MDUxMmdkZTcwNzZibzFlM2JjODYxODZhNzljMDFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGdxZGZtaisza3ZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdxYmVvNytvbG8yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Z3FkZm1qKzNrdmdAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39102,"nextInTopic":39114,"prevInTime":39112,"nextInTime":39114,"topicId":39070,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Although I don t expect a lot of you to understand this, please remember this child is an older (meaning not a baby) adoptee from a foreign country where he","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1364759121\">Although I don&#39;t expect a lot of you to understand this, please<br/>\nremember this child is an older (meaning not a baby) adoptee from a<br/>\nforeign country where he lived in an orphanage.  The pychological<br/>\nchanges this makes to a child are profound.  My own daugther spent 3<br/>\nyrs tied on her back in a crib.  I had to &quot;teach&quot; her how to cry, that<br/>\nher needs would be met, that she even HAD needs...forget about wants.<br/>\nNow home some 15 months, she knows what she wants when we deal with<br/>\nbasic ideas like snack foods, and toys.  But she has NO opinion on<br/>\nclothes, dinner foods, whether or not she eats breakfast etc....<br/>\n<br/>\nSo asking Kelly to ask her son to be a partner in this journey isn&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily going to work.  Additionally, children from orphanages<br/>\ntend to be severely emotionally, if not developmentally retarded<br/>\n(retarded used in it&#39;s perfectly acceptable English definition here<br/>\nnot the common usage) so her son can look 8 or 10 or 22 but be 2 or 5<br/>\nor 15 etc...depending on the skill you are looking at.  My daughter is<br/>\n4.5 but is really more like a 2 yr old in many ways.  And she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nspeak.  So in speech, expressive speech, she&#39;s even further behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the final &quot;gift&quot; of the orphanage experience is the inability to<br/>\ngrasp what it means to be &quot;family&quot; , that one won&#39;t be &quot;sent back&quot; for<br/>\ndoing &quot;bad things&quot;, abuse, neglect, teasing, malnutrition, resource<br/>\nguarding and fighting, and a general mistrust of strangers.  So if<br/>\nanyone can help Kelly keeping these very primal triggers in mind that<br/>\nwould be good.  I&#39;m reading this too because Morgan has been<br/>\n&quot;prescribed&quot; a Nothing In Life Is Free program to make her speak (in<br/>\nother words, she wants a snack and I dangle it over her head until she<br/>\nsays &quot;snack&quot; or whatever...and I&#39;m not going to do that to her.)

It was the closest thing I found on the site that seemed to sort of mirror what you are going through.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thinkkids.org/blog/?id=1\">http://www.thinkkids.org/blog/?id=1</a> and look for &quot;No Compromise?&quot;  7/30/2008<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t speak to the legal ramifications of letting him stop, but I would think/hope that if you took a break with the intention of starting again next year or whenever, that you would be &quot;safe.&quot; Is there a homeschooling advocate in your area you can consult? You may want to know how much leeway you have before you agree on a solution with your son. If he wants to just quit, but that will land you in trouble and him in school, that is something you need to know. But if he could take a break for the remainder of the school year with no legal ramifications, you might want to know that, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck,<br/>\nAngela Wolff</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77669557,"authorName":"gailbrocop@aol.com","from":"gailbrocop@...","profile":"gailbrocop","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Speech Therapy Frustration","postDate":"1237990894","msgId":39083,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQjdCNkMyMjhFMEY3QS1DODAtQTg0QG1ibGstZDM5LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdxYmVvNytvbG8yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdxYmVvNytvbG8yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39070,"nextInTopic":39084,"prevInTime":39082,"nextInTime":39084,"topicId":39070,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a question about helping one of my sons deal with some frustration he is having.

I do understand both sides of your situation.? Since your son has the physical issues that come with cleft palate, speech therapy should be the best avenue to help him get to the point where his speech is more understandable.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first suggestions would be to help him to develop ownership of his speech.? What can be done so that he is the one making the decisions about his communication abilities??? Things to consider...<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes he like the speech therapist?? If not, consider getting another one who will work with him.? Maybe 30 minutes is too long for him and 15 minutes to demonstrate how to work on one thing and then ideas for practicing at home might help.? Maybe twice a week would be enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould the therapist be willing to work with you during that 30 minutes and then you help him (maybe in a game format) with some of the sounds he is working on?? Would she give him some options for fun therapy activities that he would enjoy?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe take a break from speech therapy and see if the speech pathologist would give your son some things to work on at home?? The whole idea here is to have your son be the one that chooses how he wants to pursue this.? In this way, it becomes a partnership with the three of you rather than someone making him do something that is just really difficult and often frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;d like to write to me off list, I&#39;d be happy to give you some resources where you could also buy some games that he might enjoy as he develops more sounds as well as brainstorm with you about more ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nGail<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hummingbirdhaven.blogspot.com\">http://hummingbirdhaven.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":369128977,"authorName":"tuemian","from":"&quot;tuemian&quot; &lt;tuemian@...&gt;","profile":"tuemian","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Speech Therapy Frustration","postDate":"1237984002","msgId":39100,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdxZDd1MitiM2l0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdxYmVvNytvbG8yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39095,"nextInTopic":39102,"prevInTime":39099,"nextInTime":39101,"topicId":39070,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Kelly, I m new to this group too and just stumbled across another article on another group, that might help you.

Sometimes you can keep track of the hits through beads, blocks, stickers or the like that are traded in for a chosen reward later.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I know, you don&#39;t like incentives but maybe for him a very visible association like &quot;with every block I collect, my friends will understand me better&quot; could help him keep going - just a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor an incentive, what about a picture representing a sound or word he said correctly, which he can color in and put on the fridge or somewhere in his room to look at and be happy about his achievments?<br/>\nI&#39;d probabely start with the words or sounds he&#39;s already pretty good at, to help him feel positive about what he can do already (instead of focussing on what he can&#39;t do).

I&#39;m new to this list.<br/>\nI have five kids, four unschooling, (really<br/>\nmore still deschooling at this point), and <br/>\none in school by his choice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question about helping one of my sons <br/>\ndeal with some frustration he is having.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was born with a cleft lip and palate.<br/>\nHe lived in an orphanage until just<br/>\nthis past July, when he joined our family.<br/>\nHe never had any speech therapy before<br/>\njoining our family.  He is eight, will be<br/>\nnine in a few days.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince coming home to us, we have had<br/>\nhim going to speech therapy three or<br/>\nfour days a week.  Right now, the only<br/>\nsounds he can make are L, M, N, and<br/>\nvowel sounds, plus glottal stops.<br/>\n(If you don&#39;t know what a glottal stop is,<br/>\nsay &quot;uh-oh!&quot;  Feel how you stop the air<br/>\nin your throat between the &quot;uh&quot; and the &quot;oh&quot;?<br/>\nThat&#39;s a glottal stop.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the issue is, our son does not like<br/>\nspeech therapy.  He gets very frustrated,<br/>\nand he doesn&#39;t want to go and work at something<br/>\nso frustrating.  I can understand that. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf somebody told me that I MUST learn to do all the <br/>\nthings with my toes that I am currently able to do with <br/>\nmy fingers, I would be really frustrated.  I KNOW<br/>\nthere are people out there who are able to do it.<br/>\nI suppose I could learn how to coordinate all those<br/>\nlittle muscles, too.  But it would be really frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference is, if I don&#39;t learn to use my feet like<br/>\nhands, nothing in my life changes (as far as I know!)<br/>\nIf my son doesn&#39;t go to speech therapy, he avoids<br/>\nthe frustration of doing exercises that are hard, but<br/>\nhe INCREASES the frustration of most people not being<br/>\nable to understand a word he says.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis speech language pathologist keeps asking me<br/>\nwhat motivates my son.  She is looking for an<br/>\nincentive program to keep him on track.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have told her, time and again, that our family<br/>\ndoes not believe in forcing children to do specific<br/>\ntasks, and that we really do not dig token economies,<br/>\nbut the SLP keeps asking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know my job is not to please her, but to advocate<br/>\nfor and support my son.  But it is complicated, because<br/>\nas much as he dislikes speech therapy, he equally dislikes<br/>\nnot being able to make himself understood.  (His sibs<br/>\nand I understand him, but most people he interacts with<br/>\nsimply have NO IDEA what he is saying, and it really<br/>\ndoes frustrate him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne choice I have is to drop the speech therapy, and let<br/>\nhim tell me if and when he is ready to give it another try.<br/>\nLet him decide which frustrations he is going to face.<br/>\nThat option opens me up to investigation:  where I live,<br/>\nthe law requires homeschooling families to provide<br/>\n&quot;special educational services&quot; (speech therapy would count)<br/>\nto children who need such services.  I could be accused<br/>\nof educational neglect for not forcing speech therapy on him.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut setting aside fear of the law, I do feel confident that a time<br/>\nwill come when his desire to be understood by others will<br/>\noutweigh his reluctance to face the hard work the therapy<br/>\nentails.  Perhaps in a few more years, when hormones hit,<br/>\nand he becomes interested in romance?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am currently doing is let him know that I understand<br/>\nhe is frustrated, but I think he should continue on.  I remind him <br/>\nthat *he* really wants his friends to understand what<br/>\nhe is saying and that the work he is doing in speech therapy<br/>\nis what is going to allow him to learn how to speak clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI accept that in any 30 minute session, my son<br/>\nmay goof around for 25 minutes and do &quot;only&quot;<br/>\nfive minutes of &quot;productive&quot; work.  I accept the<br/>\nfact that this is frustrating for the SLP.  But<br/>\nthe SLP&#39;s frustration is not my concern.  My son&#39;s<br/>\nfrustration is.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, to reiterate, he is going to be frustrated by his<br/>\nspeech impediment (I wish there were a better word<br/>\nor phrase than that) whether he works on overcoming<br/>\nit or whether he chooses not to work on overcoming it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe tells me he doesn&#39;t want to go.  Do I honor that?<br/>\nIf I do, the natural consequence is that people will<br/>\ncontinue to not understand him, and he will continue<br/>\nto be frustrated by that, and shut out of friendships<br/>\nbecause of it.  I see him trying to strike up conversations<br/>\nwith the other boys on his gymnastics team and in his<br/>\nTae Kwon Do class.  I see him fighting back tears when<br/>\nthey simply turn away from him b/c they don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat he is saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing those interactions leads me to believe that<br/>\ncontinuing to encourage him to go to speech therapy<br/>\nis the right thing to do.  But where does encouraging<br/>\nend and forcing begin?<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not like failing to  honor his right to say, <br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t want to do this.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, I have already done that to him.<br/>\nHe needed ear tubes to drain fluid from<br/>\nhis middle ears and he needed his soft<br/>\npalate lengthened, and although he told me,<br/>\n&quot;I already had two surgeries in China; I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to have more surgery!&quot; I went ahead and<br/>\nlet the surgeons put those tubes in and lengthen<br/>\nthat palate, b/c I understood there were medical<br/>\nissues that my son could not understand.<br/>\nStill, it didn&#39;t feel good, forcing surgery on him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, to sum up:  if you were in our shoes,<br/>\nwhat would you do?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour advice, suggestions, wisdom is much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Sturman<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kelly-livingjoyfully.blogspot.com\">http://kelly-livingjoyfully.blogspot.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39107,"nextTopicId":39157}}
