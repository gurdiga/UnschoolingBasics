I haven&#39;t purposely<br/>\nlaid out and tanned since I was in Junior High (probably 7th or 8th grade)<br/>\nand I&#39;m 31 now.  I try to get some sunlight because we all need that (I<br/>\nespecially need it in the winter time because I deal with seasonal<br/>\ndepression... I have a special light box for winter when the sunlight doesn<br/>\nt happen much) but direct sunlight in the heat of summer gives me a<br/>\nthrobbing headache... and I like my milky white skin (it&#39;s a much better<br/>\ncanvas for tattoos).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnyhow... I don&#39;t force my DD to wear sunscreen... usually if we&#39;re going to<br/>\nbe in the sun, it&#39;s not going to be for any long period of time.

Might wanna<br/>\nre-think slathering it on your youngun&#39;s unless absolutely necessary.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I have read this, too.  It seems that the culprit may be *chemical* sunscreens that somehow react w/ the skin in a harmful way.  We avoid those and use &quot;natural&quot; sunscreens that contain physical blocks.  I also wear a wide-brimmed hat and clothing to protect myself if I can&#39;t avoid being in the sun during the peak hours.  My older children choose not to wear sunscreen much of the time (my younger ones don&#39;t seem to mind it), but they are rarely in the sun to the extent that they get burned (or even very tanned).  However, my teenage son went tubing w/ some friends last summer, didn&#39;t wear sunscreen or a shirt and ended up w/ a blistering burn on his back and shoulders that was very painful.  He&#39;s more careful now because of that experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also do believe that people are duped into thinking that they are safe from any harmful effects from the sun as long as they are wearing sunscreen.  I think people naturally assume that they can be outside for as long as they&#39;d like even when the rays are strongest (and that they are in Australia!) -- just slather on the sunscreen and everything&#39;s a-okay.  Not true.  I wonder how that phenomenon comes into play with respect to the increase in skin cancer. <br/>\n<br/>\nCathy     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"sunscreen","postDate":"1158761194","msgId":17472,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVlcmh0YStvajc4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17471,"nextInTopic":17475,"prevInTime":17471,"nextInTime":17473,"topicId":17445,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh, and let s not forget the lack of ozone, the naturally occuring protection from harmful rays, being depleted.

He is far less alternative <br/>\nthan I choose to be. The kids and I rarely use it and only do so if <br/>\nwe are to be in the sun all day. We spent at least 3 days a week at <br/>\nthe pool during the summer and never burned. I have a naked boy who <br/>\nlikes to play outside all the time with no clothes on and an older <br/>\nboy who loves to go shirtless. Neither has burned since babyhood - <br/>\nwhen we took care not to have them exposed too much. When we do <br/>\napply sunscreen, we apply regular lotion first so the sunscreen <br/>\nstays on top and doesn&#39;t absorb as much.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we buy the insect spray or lotion from the health food store. <br/>\nI use a lot of essential oils for the after bites, if they get them.<br/>\n<br/>\nGinger<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;camden&quot; &lt;ccoutlaw@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ***Are there more of you on this list that prefer not to use <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sunscreen on <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; yourself or children?***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My family also prefers to generally stay away from sunscreen, we <br/>\n </span></blockquote>like to avoid chemical lotions & sprays.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; My kids wear shirts when they swim in the pool mid-day to protect <br/>\n </span></blockquote>their upper bodies.
