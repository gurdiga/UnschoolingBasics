I&#39;ve been crazy busy this past week <br/>\nwith VBS at church and just haven&#39;t been online much which has felt <br/>\nvery strange for me! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t DO summer anymore than we DO any other traditional school <br/>\nbreak. Life doesn&#39;t stop during the summer. We live and learn <br/>\nevery day of every year during our entire lifetime. The whole point <br/>\nof unschooling is to learn to step away from the nonsensical method <br/>\nof viewing learning as being able to happen only in certain places <br/>\n(i.e. classrooms, labs, etc.) or at certain times (from Sept to May, <br/>\nMonday through Friday, 8am to 3pm). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing I see most newbies to unschooling misunderstand is <br/>\nthat life and learning happen without us pointing it out to one <br/>\nanother, whether to our spouses, friends, children, or whoever. New <br/>\nunschoolers expect their children to choose to do schoolish things <br/>\nlike work through a Math textbook, study a certain time period in <br/>\nHistory perhaps through reading regular books, set up a Science <br/>\nexperiment, etc. It truly helps to focus YOUR thinking away from <br/>\nschoolish things. All the things we do in life can be categorized <br/>\nin some manner if you speak educationlese, but one wonders WHY you <br/>\nneed to do that? For example, when you prepare your grocery list <br/>\nand complete your shopping, do you award yourself a grade or some <br/>\nother form of external reward for doing something in Home <br/>\nEconomics? Do you consider your Math lessons done for the day when <br/>\nyou balance your checkbook? Adults do not, normally, separate <br/>\neverything into subjects but we sure expect that of our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first started unschooling, I had to genuinely believe that it <br/>\nwas OKAY that my children may never, never do anything that looks <br/>\nlike schoolwork. Over time, I&#39;ve become so excited by that fact <br/>\nthat I now take a double-look when I do see them choosing something <br/>\nthat looks like schoolwork! *lol* <br/>\n<br/>\nI may repeat this alot and it&#39;s also for my sake, but I think <br/>\nthe &#39;unschooling&#39; term is more for us parents trying to let go. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think of my kids as unschooling because they aren&#39;t trying to <br/>\nundo anything. Instead, they are living life... actually WE are <br/>\nliving together and that encompasses so very much if you truly stop <br/>\nand marvel at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to top Reply (via email) | Reply (via web post) <br/>\nMessages in this topic (12) <br/>\n1b.

With the unschooling philosophy of your children pursuing what<br/>\n&gt; interests them, i.e. making learning and doing a natural part of life, along<br/>\n&gt; with working at their own pace, how do you do your summer break?

I&#39;m relatively new to this, but wanted to <br/>\nshare something. Rachel, my six yo, came up to me last week with a <br/>\npuzzled look on her face. I asked her what was going on (I was <br/>\nkneading dough at the time), and she looked up at me and said <br/>\n&quot;Multiplying things is figuring out how much groups of numbers equal, <br/>\nright?&quot; I thought I knew where she was going with this, but I asked <br/>\nher to clarify. &quot;Well, if you have nine of something, then that&#39;s <br/>\nnine times one&quot;, I affirmed this and she continued. &quot;So, if you <br/>\nwanted to do nine times two, it would be eighteen, right?&quot; Yup. &quot;But <br/>\nif you said nine times zero, it would mean you had nothing!&quot;. Yep, <br/>\nyou&#39;re right again. &quot;But I&#39;ll bet nine times infinity is still <br/>\ninfinity.&quot; Holy cow child!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t need to memorize anything. It came to her, on her own, <br/>\nwhile she was counting ants in the backyard. Something I had to be <br/>\ntaught in animal behavior was to estimate herds and flock numbers by <br/>\ncounting by groups. She figured it out on her own. College is <br/>\noverrated. College prep is doubly so. You&#39;re eight year old will do <br/>\nthe math she needs. Math isn&#39;t hard. Nothing truly is until you are <br/>\ntold that it is (or unless you are forced to learn it when you&#39;re not <br/>\nready), and you&#39;re own baggage makes it difficult at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy four year old is learning how to read. i haven&#39;t taught him. He <br/>\nstarted by wanting to find his sports bottle in the cabinet. He finds <br/>\nS-A-M. Then it moved to reading the bionicles gameboy game, he needed <br/>\nto know which defense to use. I have never taught him ABC&#39;s or <br/>\nphonics or even Dolce sight words. but he can read....<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople are talking about trust. I know you probably feel attacked <br/>\nright now, but don&#39;t take it personally. Take it as genuine concern <br/>\nfor your family, and try to be open minded about listening. Trust <br/>\nopens up the world, suspicion closes minds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOn Jun 10, 2006, at 9:49 AM, squeakybiscuit wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am hesitant because I&#39;m not sure you can go to college successfully<br/>\n&gt; with unschooling.

YOU want to learn about unschooling so you are surrounding<br/>\nyourself with information about unschooling. You have bought a book,<br/>\njoined a webgroup, looked things up on the ineternet, joined in<br/>\ndiscussions, and are immersing yourself in that interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first step you are going to have to do before your children can<br/>\nget to that point is to deschool. Even though you have homeschooled<br/>\nall their lives, you have still have very schoolish ways of doing<br/>\nthings. Your children are going to have to learn to trust that you<br/>\nare going to let them delve (like you are doing) all the subjects that<br/>\ninterest them. That&#39;s *all* the subjects, just not the schoolish<br/>\nlooking subjects. There are *some* children who will do the same with<br/>\nmath or reading or geography or science or social studies, but it<br/>\nwon&#39;t look like school - it will look a lot like them pursuing their<br/>\ninterests.

Our first five were girls...the last <br/>\ntwo boys. What a WORLD of difference. They truely are from <br/>\nMars! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOur oldest boy, Andrew, is 14, and he has wanted to go into the <br/>\nmilitary ever since he was five-years-old. He loves everything guns <br/>\nand knives. He loves to explore martial arts. He thinks the idea <br/>\nof killing a squirrel or a bird is a-okay, and in the right instance <br/>\nmaybe even funny. Andrew is also a natural shot and great hunter. <br/>\nHe views violence in war as necessary and acceptable. On the flip <br/>\nside he is excellent with young children, extremely helpful, <br/>\ncompassionate, a good writer and a wonderful artist who wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhurt anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur youngest boy, Adrian, is 12, and he loves &quot;violent&quot; video games, <br/>\nb.b. guns, South Park, Joe Cartoon and looks forward to joining Pat <br/>\nand Andrew for his first hunt this fall even though he&#39;s a <br/>\nvegetarian. On the flip side he is thoughtful, knowledgable about <br/>\nsmall animals and history, has extreme polital views and interests <br/>\nand is also good with young children. He would never hurt anyone <br/>\nand thinks senseless killing is, well, senseless.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that our boys can come as a shock to us moms at times. <br/>\nThere were times that Adrian&#39;s &quot;dark side&quot; made me raise an eyebrow <br/>\nhere and there, but I just paid close attention to him. I listened <br/>\nmore and got as in tune with him as I possibly could. From my <br/>\nexperience it seems that boys, maybe not all of them...but at least <br/>\nsome of them, go through a real &quot;snakes and snails&quot; phase. They are <br/>\nSO different than girls, and I&#39;m a girl. So, I don&#39;t get A LOT <br/>\nabout them. When it comes to this I am VERY grateful that my <br/>\nhusband is around. I also try to read about boys specifically. It <br/>\nreally does help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also try to be VERY, VERY open to them. They talk about <br/>\ndisgusting stuff that involves bodily fluids, bodily sounds and <br/>\nnatural urges. They talk about killing and hurting and like <br/>\naggressive things. That&#39;s not my bag, but I do talk and laugh with <br/>\nthem. If something REALLY grosses me out, or I just can&#39;t handle <br/>\nthe way they are talking, I will comment something to the tune <br/>\nof, &quot;Okay, ladies are present.&quot; or, &quot;Mom&#39;s REALLY don&#39;t NEED to know <br/>\nthat!&quot; This is always with a smile, and they tend to laugh, but <br/>\nthey do back it off a bit to respect my poor, little brain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever &quot;get&quot; boys, but I do know we have <br/>\nexcellent relationships with eachother. It didn&#39;t start this way, <br/>\nbut it became open and wonderful by one means. Someone else <br/>\nmentioned it earlier, *I* changed, not them. It is SO true that <br/>\nyour behavior will change your children. Openness is ESSENTIAL for <br/>\na mom to have a successful relationship with her son...not that it <br/>\nisn&#39;t essential for other things too, we just happen to be talking <br/>\nabout boys right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two-cents worth...<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to top Reply (via email) | Reply (via web post) <br/>\nMessages in this topic (8) <br/>\n5c.
