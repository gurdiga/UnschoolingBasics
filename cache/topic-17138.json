We  <br/>\nthink that this is also just trusting in us again, that when she&#39;ll  <br/>\nask for help, she&#39;ll really get it, so she doesn&#39;t have to make up a  <br/>\nshow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I don&#39;t understand is why you don&#39;t want her to talk on the  <br/>\nphone when it is that late? Just because it seems &quot;sneaky&quot;? I mean...  <br/>\nisn&#39;t it maybe, because then you cannot control it at all, or because  <br/>\nthen you&#39;ll not know how long it was, or... ? It seems kind of  <br/>\narbitrary a request, not to call late, even though you don&#39;t make it  <br/>\nan official prohibition. Because why shouldn&#39;t she? He&#39;s awake, she&#39;s  <br/>\nawake, they are in the middle of their &quot;days&quot;, she&#39;s not disturbing  <br/>\nanybody, AND she can be in privacy.

It turned out she  <br/>\nhas no job and had been lying all along, the thigns were stolen or  <br/>\npaid with VISA, the account not covered though so she has 20000 €  <br/>\ndebts. So even in &quot;real life&quot; you can never know. A similar thing  <br/>\nhappened to my mother, and I think many people have encountered these  <br/>\nkinds of situations. Should we raise our children in fear that you  <br/>\ncannot trust anybody?<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter we give them the tools to do it the best we can, give them  <br/>\nsupport if anything happens and stay close with them in trust (rather  <br/>\nthan thinking &quot;should I ask her or not if she phoned him...&quot; and be  <br/>\nable to talk to stay informed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is that you shouldn&#39;t think that just because you don&#39;t  <br/>\ngive your telephone number that youa re safe! Anyone can find out who  <br/>\nthe internet access belongs to, if someone really wanted, and mostly  <br/>\nthe numbers are registered somewhere anyway. And someone doesn&#39;t need  <br/>\nyour telephone number to harass you, it can happen on the streets as  <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, the research Jann and her daughter could do, would be  <br/>\nmore effective than anything I can think of. Just talking about  <br/>\ninternet safety is not enough, if her daughter believes or &quot;feels&quot;  <br/>\nthat she CAN trust that guy. So examples of people who are not really  <br/>\ntrust worthy are needed, and they needn&#39;t wait until something  <br/>\n&quot;happens&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings<br/>\nJohanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle Leifur Reid","from":"&quot;Michelle Leifur Reid&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Teens & Late Night Internet Chat","postDate":"1157813058","msgId":17147,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA5MDkwNzQ0dTY2NTg5MTEyajRmN2ZlODhkNzBiNzA5MzZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDI0QjkxRjc1LUI5RUQtNEQ5RC04Mjc5LTM5RTA3NkM4QkFBMEBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGVkc2JtbStyM3RjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDI0QjkxRjc1LUI5RUQtNEQ5RC04Mjc5LTM5RTA3NkM4QkFBMEBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17140,"nextInTopic":17148,"prevInTime":17146,"nextInTime":17148,"topicId":17138,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

IMO, this is not fully true, if you  <br/>\nthink about it carefully. You do not trust the other guys, and in  <br/>\ncertain ways you do trust that she doesn&#39;t *want* anything bad  <br/>\nhappens to her, but you do not trust in her ability to detect a &quot;bad  <br/>\nguy&quot;, or you do not trust that she believes you when you are trying  <br/>\nto say &quot;nobody is trust worthy on the internet, because you can never  <br/>\nknow&quot; (in case this is your point). It is OK if you do not trust her  <br/>\nin that! But then, start not saying you trust her, when you do not  <br/>\ntrust her fully, she&#39;ll know.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, you said you don&#39;t know if she&#39;s talking to him on the phone,  <br/>\nand if it is concerning you and your inner, natural limits, because  <br/>\nit&#39;s just driving you crazy and you can&#39;t sleep at nights because you  <br/>\nare afraid (or whatever reaction you may have), you will just need to  <br/>\ntalk to her about that, openly. Tell her your concerns. Tell her you  <br/>\ndon&#39;t trust in her ability to detect a bad guy (or the other thing).  <br/>\nTell her that you are afraid. She might understand!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd third, teach her to detect such a guy if that is your problem! If  <br/>\nyou have the time, you might just chat together in another chatroom.  <br/>\nChat a lot. I know she might be too old to &quot;play games&quot;, but I think  <br/>\nit could still be fun to make it a game. You are anonymous. You can  <br/>\nmake up an identity and talk to guys. See what the guys say and talk  <br/>\nabout how you think this guy is and if he seems to be trustworthy or  <br/>\nnot and WHY and ask her how she would think about this or that other  <br/>\nguy. You can even do it so far as to accept invitations of actually  <br/>\nmeeting the person. You can go together and check it out. Find out if  <br/>\nthe people lie or not. Since you are anonymous and you are not  <br/>\nexperimenting with her already &quot;friends&quot;, you can tell those other  <br/>\npeople whatever you want, just to test. This might also let her think  <br/>\nabout how people can make up an identity on the other end of the  <br/>\nline!!! And you can try things out like: Yeah, you can invite me, but  <br/>\nI&#39;m 13 and you&#39;ll have to say hello to my mom. Or, I&#39;m 25 and I have  <br/>\nbig boops! Or, I&#39;m 57 and have 5 children... See how the guys would  <br/>\nreact. Talk about how these guys react. Talk about what kind of  <br/>\nreactions you would have liked instead (if). For instance, if the  <br/>\nguys would leave instantly, you can derive from this behaviour that  <br/>\nhe is not really interested then. Or that he is afraid. Or something  <br/>\nelse. These are just ideas, you can do all or some or nothing. And of  <br/>\ncourse it only works, if she would like to do that. But maybe she  <br/>\nwants. Because she wants to be safe, and if she knows about internet  <br/>\nsafety already she might be interested in such a test (and it is  <br/>\nfun). And if you told her your true concerns she might also want to  <br/>\ndo if for you, to ease your stress and your fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause you are unschooling, you know that if she doesn&#39;t get the  <br/>\nchance to check out this medium she&#39;ll probably be even more naive  <br/>\nabout it whenever she&#39;ll be able to use it, so you don&#39;t want to  <br/>\nforbid it. But you are still concerned. But you are concerned about  <br/>\nher ability to detect bad guys, so I think you have to approach the  <br/>\nproblem from that end. When you have done &quot;research&quot; together, you  <br/>\nmight as well come up with a thesis that says that nobody is actually  <br/>\nreally trustworthy on the internet. Or that some are and some don&#39;t  <br/>\nand that there are different criteria which can help you determine  <br/>\nif. There is always a risk. But you will also always be there for her  <br/>\njust in case. There are dangers on the street as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.: Since I&#39;m unschooling only for a very very short time, I don&#39;t  <br/>\nknow if my advices are really according to unschooling principles.  <br/>\nAnyone is free to tell me where I&#39;m wrong.

So far I know the connection of all<br/>\nthe people on her buddy list (RL friends of RL friends, no internet<br/>\n&quot;buddies&quot; met online).  We talk often about ways to keep safe on the<br/>\ninternet.

I used to stay up with <br/>\nher until maybe 2 or 3 AM as she didn&#39;t want to be alone, but <br/>\nfinally we had a discussion about it because it was catching up with <br/>\nme (I can&#39;t sleep as long on the other end).  She decided she wanted <br/>\nto stay up on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe plays World of Warcraft almost exclusively, and has since she <br/>\nleft school in June 2005 (end of 6th grade).  This has been her <br/>\nfirst year, deschooling, healing.   I&#39;ve had my struggles but get <br/>\nlots of help by coming here and continuing to read and deschool <br/>\nmyself.   Our relationship has improved greatly, more mutual <br/>\nrespect, trust etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBack in the spring she learned how to talk to her friends on the <br/>\ngame through a headset and approached me about getting one.   She <br/>\nshowed me the software (free download), her dad checked it (he&#39;s the <br/>\ncomputer guy) as she knows we want to be sure it&#39;s legit etc and we <br/>\ngot the headset.  She&#39;s really enjoyed talking with the friends <br/>\nshe&#39;s made in the game while they&#39;re playing.  She doesn&#39;t have a <br/>\nlot of friends IRL (she&#39;s always had a hard time connecting with her <br/>\npeers).   This group is a variety of ages, including teens and <br/>\nadults.   She talks to me fairly often about the different people.   <br/>\nOne (I&#39;ll call him &quot;J&quot;) has come up more often lately.  I asked a <br/>\nlittle about him, how old, what state does he live in  she knows to <br/>\nnot say where she lives, only the state once she gets to &quot;know&quot; them <br/>\nbetter, most of the people are mid to west coast  how old is he <br/>\netc).  She isn&#39;t always sure, she doesn&#39;t ask a lot of questions, <br/>\nbut picks it up from the general conversations, but I think he&#39;s at <br/>\nleast 18.   She has also mentioned that a couple of the adults (I&#39;m <br/>\nassuming, or hoping) are sometimes drunk (she thinks it&#39;s comical-<br/>\nanother topic for discussion we have too) but I&#39;m not sure if he was <br/>\none of them.   She also says most don&#39;t know how old she is, she&#39;s <br/>\nconcerned they&#39;ll &quot;reject&quot; (not the word I want) her if they find <br/>\nout she&#39;s &quot;only 13&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have cordless phones and this morning I went to hit redial <br/>\nthinking I was recalling the last number I dialed, and it was &quot;J&#39;s&quot; <br/>\nnumber (cell phone).  It went to voice mail.   Then, it occurred to <br/>\nme that the phone upstairs (that she uses earlier in the evening <br/>\nmany days to talk to her friend (who is in school)) has been in the <br/>\nbathroom when I get up in the morning for a few days now (I use it <br/>\nas well from my office also on the 2nd floor).   One of the last <br/>\nthings I do before I go to bed is replace the 2 cordless phones in <br/>\ntheir cradles to recharge them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how to approach her about this.

I registered with &quot;Do Not Call&quot; <br/>\nquite a while ago and the telemarketer calls have all but ceased, so <br/>\nnow I&#39;m wondering if it might be connected.  I didn&#39;t pick it up, <br/>\nthat&#39;s why we have an answering machine if it&#39;s a number I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow, I&#39;ve also heard that telemarketers have a computer program <br/>\nthat will call randomly to see if someone picks up, just to register <br/>\nwhen to call for real.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve talked many times about how it&#39;s not HER I don&#39;t trust, its <br/>\nother more experienced and older/stronger (for real life situations <br/>\nwhen we&#39;ve talked about abduction etc) people.  Also, she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave the world experience of knowing how to read people yet.
