I figured out a few things about his name calling: 1) he uses it as a defense mechanism, like when he&#39;s nervous or whatever (he called the &quot;haircutters&quot; long poopers : )because he was scared of them) 2) he does it when he wants to get a rise out of someone (he especially likes calling his grandpas stupid because he wants them to chase him or something)  3)the more someone tells him it&#39;s not nice the more he does it.  Anyhow, those are my observations so far and I still haven&#39;t figured out if he needs more help getting through this or if it&#39;s just a phase.  But so far, it has only been a big deal to one of my SILs.  I usually just say, &quot;Oh, are you trying to get their attention? (with a goofy giggle and a grin)&quot; or &quot;Oh are you nervous? (with a hug)&quot;  I know that he is not trying to hurt someone else, but rather to protect himself.  Maybe you could figure out why your son is doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeanette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Maisha Khalfani &lt;maitai373@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSent: Saturday, May 24, 2008 11:04:45 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] FW: name calling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this has been covered on here, but I didn�t pay much attention to the<br/>\nissue because it didn�t involve me.
