What kind of adjustment <br/>\nperiods do<br/>\nI need to know about?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rule of thumb is one month of deschooling for each year they (and <br/>\n*you*) were in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the best thing you can do---especially since it&#39;s summer, is to <br/>\njust keep having summer vacation. Don&#39;t quit in September. Have fun <br/>\nwith your passions. Immerse yourselves in them. If you&#39;re having too <br/>\nmuch fun, GOOD!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if the kids seem dazed and out of it, they *still* <br/>\nneed to deschool. It may not look the same as days full of fun and <br/>\npassions. If school really took a lot out of them, they may be listless <br/>\nand unwillling to try anything new. They need to heal.

They hang around. Even if they don&#39;t like what <br/>\n we&#39;re saying. Why do I think that is?<br/>\n <br/>\n As owner, I am notified when members sub and unsub. They often say <br/>\n they will leave; they don&#39;t.<br/>\n <br/>\n The list is feeding *something* in them. And many---most---eventually <br/>\n make the huge paradigm shift (or at least a step or two in the <br/>\n unschooling direction) that it takes to unschool. Then they start to <br/>\n post and joyfully add to the conversations. There are at least a dozen <br/>\n parents new to this list who are adding to the conversations regularly <br/>\n now. It&#39;s fun to watch them jump in and scream, &quot;The water&#39;s FINE!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n *Anyone* can post and not be afraid of getting blasted. But she&#39;ll <br/>\n have to *think* about what she posts first. Saying that &quot;a child <br/>\n *needs* punishment or at least disapproval&quot; and then saying that she <br/>\n didn&#39;t say that is not OK.<br/>\n <br/>\n I have no problem being challenged. Challenge me. I like a debate. I <br/>\n like answering unschooling questions. A lot. But I want to talk with <br/>\n someone who *WANTS* to unschool. Who&#39;s TRYING to get there. If I wanted <br/>\n to argue with someone for the sake of arguing, I could call one of my <br/>\n sisters-in-law. Or go to the grocery store! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n I&#39;m tired of working with someone who doesn&#39;t want to unschool. There <br/>\n are plenty of people who DO want to get it; I&#39;d rather save all my <br/>\n energy for them.<br/>\n <br/>\n On the plus side, maybe someone benefited from this last exchange. <br/>\n Maybe something Ren or Pam or dear, patient Marji (or <br/>\n godforbid---something *I* said) made a difference in some child&#39;s life <br/>\n tonight.<br/>\n <br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n We are told on other lists to come here because we don&#39;t know enough <br/>\n or aren&#39;t<br/>\n   quite there yet or have a lot of questions. But then when we are here <br/>\n we are<br/>\n  told we aren&#39;t forced to be here and to go on.<br/>\n <br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n I think it&#39;s silly to think you can&#39;t ask questions. But *THINK* <br/>\n before you ask. But badmouthing children is not going to go over well <br/>\n here. Thinking poorly of them won&#39;t either. Do you want to know how it <br/>\n works in our families? Or do you just want to argue that you way is <br/>\n &quot;just as right&quot; as mine/ours? Punishing is NOT just as OK as not <br/>\n punishing. Rewarding is NOT just as OK as not rewarding. Sending a <br/>\n child to his room to think about it is NOT just as OK as hugging him <br/>\n and making sure his needs are met (before you rant and rail).<br/>\n <br/>\n There are mainstream answers you can get to almost every scenario <br/>\n brought up here. Hell, just go ask Dr Phil or John (yuck!) Rosemond. <br/>\n They will FILL you with mainstream parenting ideas---maybe even some <br/>\n you haven&#39;t thought of! Jeez---you could just shout a question out your <br/>\n back door and be blasted with well-meaning mainstream parenting &quot;tips&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\n But to get someone who will question *why* you think you need to do <br/>\n that---there are only a few places that can do that. Why do you think <br/>\n that is? Maybe we&#39;ve been questioned ourselves? Maybe we struggled and <br/>\n have found a better way?<br/>\n <br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n So, is it that you don&#39;t want us<br/>\n  in the other lists for the &quot;old timers&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n The Always Learning list usually refers folks here because it&#39;s really <br/>\n not for &quot;how do you get your kid to read or do math&quot; questions. They <br/>\n talk more about deeper unschooling issues; that&#39;s why it was <br/>\n started---for people who didn&#39;t *need* to hear AGAIN how to get your <br/>\n child to learn history or do an experiment. A place to chat about <br/>\n unschooling without the same old questions that come up every few weeks.<br/>\n <br/>\n Unschooling Discussion is the &quot;mama&quot; list to all these. Again, I think <br/>\n many of the regular readers there were also weary of the same old <br/>\n newbie questions, but they can handle some serious debate. That list is <br/>\n definitely for delving into the whys of unschooling.<br/>\n <br/>\n The Always Learning list is for parents of kids under eight-ish. I&#39;m a <br/>\n member; I read occasionally and hardly ever post. But they&#39;re there to <br/>\n discuss how unschooling works with littluns. I don&#39;t have littluns.<br/>\n <br/>\n *This* list is for all those issues that scare new unschoolers: the <br/>\n ones that other lists just don&#39;t want to touch AGAIN. And I admit, I <br/>\n can get very tired of doing it again and again some days. But that&#39;s <br/>\n why we started this list---so that people had a place to ask those <br/>\n questions.<br/>\n <br/>\n BUT we assume that, if you&#39;re here, you are ready to take the plunge. <br/>\n Or, hell, are at least open to change. I have very little patience left <br/>\n for those who just want to poke at me or at the list.<br/>\n <br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n or you don&#39;t want us on any lists that<br/>\n   you belong to? This isn&#39;t an imflammatory question- I am very serious <br/>\n and have<br/>\n   no feelings of anger, just curiosity. What is it about newbies asking <br/>\n questions<br/>\n   and pushing the envelope that brings out ill feelings and comments <br/>\n like &quot;I&#39;ll<br/>\n   know when you leave&quot; or affirmation that you think you are better than <br/>\n another<br/>\n  mom because she isn&#39;t where you are yet in your parenting?<br/>\n <br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n Is that what you saw?<br/>\n <br/>\n *I* saw a woman who was here---NOT To get unschooling (she admitted <br/>\n that), but to ask a few questions. When she was asked the same <br/>\n questions BACK, she got defensive. She wasn&#39;t pushing *any* envelope: <br/>\n she was fighting what she perceived as a challenge to her parenting. <br/>\n The good thing is that she made some progress---I saw little lights go <br/>\n off here and there. And even though she doesn&#39;t want to unschool some <br/>\n of what she learned here *will* indeed stick with her. She *may* hate <br/>\n me, but I&#39;m not out looking for friends! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n I *do* think that I have found a better way of parenting, yes. *She* <br/>\n came *here* asking questions. I did NOT go to her to push my view onto <br/>\n her. I was asked questions and I asked back. I don&#39;t think she was sure <br/>\n of her stance or her answers.<br/>\n <br/>\n And again, as for the &quot;I&#39;ll know when you leave&quot; comment: none of you <br/>\n (especially the poster who said she would) have left yet. Often the <br/>\n poster will say she&#39;s leaving, but stay put for weeks, months.<br/>\n <br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n I know we aren&#39;t forced to be here. But what kind of answer is that to<br/>\n   someone? It&#39;s very &quot;my way or the highway&quot;. Is it necessary to feel <br/>\n left out,<br/>\n   picked on, or picked apart to stay here? Is it really okay to be harsh <br/>\n to new<br/>\n  questioning people because &quot;they aren&#39;t forced to stay&quot;?<br/>\n  -=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n I don&#39;t understand why this is so difficult to understand.<br/>\n <br/>\n You mean it&#39;s OK to complain about how lousy my party is while <br/>\n enjoying my wine and hors d&#39;ouvres?<br/>\n <br/>\n You don&#39;t have to stay at my party: you can find or host a party that <br/>\n serves Schlitz and Saltines.<br/>\n <br/>\n Some of the *best* unschooling writers are here. Some of the *best* <br/>\n unschooling parents I have ever met (and I&#39;ve met hundred and hundreds <br/>\n in person) are here. Some of the absolute *gentlest* parents are here. <br/>\n Do you not believe they are real?<br/>\n <br/>\n Well, I can understand that &quot;are they real?&quot; bit! &lt;g&gt; That&#39;s why the <br/>\n conference was started in the first place: &#39;cause I wanted to meet all <br/>\n of them and *see* that they were real.<br/>\n <br/>\n But do y&#39;all not believe that we get the &quot;results&quot; we say we do?

It&#39;s hard to give an unschooling point of view in a discussion without comparing and contrasting it to a more traditional parenting style. That&#39;s not singling anyone out as bad or even traditional. (When did that get to be a bad word? lol) It&#39;s discussing the ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a list owner or moderator. I belong to no club, organization or elite clique. I *like* differing points of view because it gets a good discussion going. When someone asks a question, I give the best unschooling answer I have on hand. When someone gets snarky, old and new posters alike, I just assume they&#39;re having a bad moment for whatever reason. It has nothing to do with me coexisting with them out here in cyberland.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am confident 100% of the time in my choice to unschool and parent as my children&#39;s partner. I wasn&#39;t always, but I am now. I&#39;ve seen the benefits. That&#39;s not to say you can&#39;t raise amazing kids a different way. It&#39;s just pointing out that what I was told repeatedly over the years from traditional sources was wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t need to punish to raise kids who know right from wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t need to shame for a child to feel bad about a misguided  action. <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t need to set a lot of rules to have a happy, peaceful, cooperative household.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t need to reward to keep my kids on the &quot;right&quot; path.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t need to teach  in order for them to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://zenmommasgarden.blogspot.com/\">http://zenmommasgarden.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water.

They hang around. Even if they don&#39;t like what <br/>\nwe&#39;re saying. Why do I think that is?<br/>\n<br/>\n  As owner, I am notified when members sub and unsub. They often say <br/>\nthey will leave; they don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The list is feeding *something* in them. And many---most---eventually <br/>\nmake the huge paradigm shift (or at least a step or two in the <br/>\nunschooling direction) that it takes to unschool. Then they start to <br/>\npost and joyfully add to the conversations. There are at least a dozen <br/>\nparents new to this list who are adding to the conversations regularly <br/>\nnow. It&#39;s fun to watch them jump in and scream, &quot;The water&#39;s FINE!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  *Anyone* can post and not be afraid of getting blasted. But she&#39;ll <br/>\nhave to *think* about what she posts first. Saying that &quot;a child <br/>\n*needs* punishment or at least disapproval&quot; and then saying that she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t say that is not OK.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have no problem being challenged. Challenge me. I like a debate. I <br/>\nlike answering unschooling questions. A lot. But I want to talk with <br/>\nsomeone who *WANTS* to unschool. Who&#39;s TRYING to get there. If I wanted <br/>\nto argue with someone for the sake of arguing, I could call one of my <br/>\nsisters-in-law. Or go to the grocery store! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m tired of working with someone who doesn&#39;t want to unschool. There <br/>\nare plenty of people who DO want to get it; I&#39;d rather save all my <br/>\nenergy for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  On the plus side, maybe someone benefited from this last exchange. <br/>\nMaybe something Ren or Pam or dear, patient Marji (or <br/>\ngodforbid---something *I* said) made a difference in some child&#39;s life <br/>\ntonight.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  We are told on other lists to come here because we don&#39;t know enough <br/>\nor aren&#39;t<br/>\n  quite there yet or have a lot of questions. But then when we are here <br/>\nwe are<br/>\n told we aren&#39;t forced to be here and to go on.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think it&#39;s silly to think you can&#39;t ask questions. But *THINK* <br/>\nbefore you ask. But badmouthing children is not going to go over well <br/>\nhere. Thinking poorly of them won&#39;t either. Do you want to know how it <br/>\nworks in our families? Or do you just want to argue that you way is <br/>\n&quot;just as right&quot; as mine/ours? Punishing is NOT just as OK as not <br/>\npunishing. Rewarding is NOT just as OK as not rewarding. Sending a <br/>\nchild to his room to think about it is NOT just as OK as hugging him <br/>\nand making sure his needs are met (before you rant and rail).<br/>\n<br/>\n  There are mainstream answers you can get to almost every scenario <br/>\nbrought up here. Hell, just go ask Dr Phil or John (yuck!) Rosemond. <br/>\nThey will FILL you with mainstream parenting ideas---maybe even some <br/>\nyou haven&#39;t thought of! Jeez---you could just shout a question out your <br/>\nback door and be blasted with well-meaning mainstream parenting &quot;tips&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But to get someone who will question *why* you think you need to do <br/>\nthat---there are only a few places that can do that. Why do you think <br/>\nthat is? Maybe we&#39;ve been questioned ourselves? Maybe we struggled and <br/>\nhave found a better way?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n So, is it that you don&#39;t want us<br/>\n in the other lists for the &quot;old timers&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  The Always Learning list usually refers folks here because it&#39;s really <br/>\nnot for &quot;how do you get your kid to read or do math&quot; questions. They <br/>\ntalk more about deeper unschooling issues; that&#39;s why it was <br/>\nstarted---for people who didn&#39;t *need* to hear AGAIN how to get your <br/>\nchild to learn history or do an experiment. A place to chat about <br/>\nunschooling without the same old questions that come up every few weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling Discussion is the &quot;mama&quot; list to all these. Again, I think <br/>\nmany of the regular readers there were also weary of the same old <br/>\nnewbie questions, but they can handle some serious debate. That list is <br/>\ndefinitely for delving into the whys of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The Always Learning list is for parents of kids under eight-ish. I&#39;m a <br/>\nmember; I read occasionally and hardly ever post. But they&#39;re there to <br/>\ndiscuss how unschooling works with littluns. I don&#39;t have littluns.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *This* list is for all those issues that scare new unschoolers: the <br/>\nones that other lists just don&#39;t want to touch AGAIN. And I admit, I <br/>\ncan get very tired of doing it again and again some days. But that&#39;s <br/>\nwhy we started this list---so that people had a place to ask those <br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n  BUT we assume that, if you&#39;re here, you are ready to take the plunge. <br/>\nOr, hell, are at least open to change. I have very little patience left <br/>\nfor those who just want to poke at me or at the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n or you don&#39;t want us on any lists that<br/>\n  you belong to? This isn&#39;t an imflammatory question- I am very serious <br/>\nand have<br/>\n  no feelings of anger, just curiosity. What is it about newbies asking <br/>\nquestions<br/>\n  and pushing the envelope that brings out ill feelings and comments <br/>\nlike &quot;I&#39;ll<br/>\n  know when you leave&quot; or affirmation that you think you are better than <br/>\nanother<br/>\n mom because she isn&#39;t where you are yet in your parenting?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Is that what you saw?<br/>\n<br/>\n  *I* saw a woman who was here---NOT To get unschooling (she admitted <br/>\nthat), but to ask a few questions. When she was asked the same <br/>\nquestions BACK, she got defensive. She wasn&#39;t pushing *any* envelope: <br/>\nshe was fighting what she perceived as a challenge to her parenting. <br/>\nThe good thing is that she made some progress---I saw little lights go <br/>\noff here and there. And even though she doesn&#39;t want to unschool some <br/>\nof what she learned here *will* indeed stick with her. She *may* hate <br/>\nme, but I&#39;m not out looking for friends! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I *do* think that I have found a better way of parenting, yes. *She* <br/>\ncame *here* asking questions. I did NOT go to her to push my view onto <br/>\nher. I was asked questions and I asked back. I don&#39;t think she was sure <br/>\nof her stance or her answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And again, as for the &quot;I&#39;ll know when you leave&quot; comment: none of you <br/>\n(especially the poster who said she would) have left yet. Often the <br/>\nposter will say she&#39;s leaving, but stay put for weeks, months.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I know we aren&#39;t forced to be here. But what kind of answer is that to<br/>\n  someone? It&#39;s very &quot;my way or the highway&quot;. Is it necessary to feel <br/>\nleft out,<br/>\n  picked on, or picked apart to stay here? Is it really okay to be harsh <br/>\nto new<br/>\n questioning people because &quot;they aren&#39;t forced to stay&quot;?<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I don&#39;t understand why this is so difficult to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You mean it&#39;s OK to complain about how lousy my party is while <br/>\nenjoying my wine and hors d&#39;ouvres?<br/>\n<br/>\n  You don&#39;t have to stay at my party: you can find or host a party that <br/>\nserves Schlitz and Saltines.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the *best* unschooling writers are here. Some of the *best* <br/>\nunschooling parents I have ever met (and I&#39;ve met hundred and hundreds <br/>\nin person) are here. Some of the absolute *gentlest* parents are here. <br/>\nDo you not believe they are real?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I can understand that &quot;are they real?&quot; bit! &lt;g&gt; That&#39;s why the <br/>\nconference was started in the first place: &#39;cause I wanted to meet all <br/>\nof them and *see* that they were real.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut do y&#39;all not believe that we get the &quot;results&quot; we say we do? Do you <br/>\nnot believe that we can shun chores and bedtimes and forced apologies  <br/>\nand reading lessons and math workbooks and rewards and punishments and <br/>\n*still* have amazingly kind, generous, and pleasant children? And not <br/>\njust children, but TEENS!? Is it that far beyond comprehension?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo need to actually answer. Just ask the question of yourself. If it <br/>\n*is* unbelievable, maybe unschooling isn&#39;t for you. If you really can&#39;t <br/>\nfathom such a life, maybe it isn&#39;t attainable. We *know* it is: we&#39;re <br/>\nliving it. And we&#39;re happy to share how to get there. But you really do <br/>\nneed to open up and believe in the possibility.

This isn&#39;t an imflammatory question- I am very serious and have no feelings of anger, just curiosity. What is it about newbies asking questions and pushing the envelope that brings out ill feelings and comments like &quot;I&#39;ll know when you leave&quot; or affirmation that you think you are better than another mom because she isn&#39;t where you are yet in your parenting?  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I know we aren&#39;t forced to be here. But what kind of answer is that to someone? It&#39;s very &quot;my way or the highway&quot;. Is it necessary to feel left out, picked on, or picked apart to stay here? Is it really okay to be harsh to new questioning people because &quot;they aren&#39;t forced to stay&quot;? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  T<br/>\n<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-149027494\">While no one is tied up or forced to do anything I think people come <br/>\nto this list hoping to find gentle advice on how to ease into <br/>\nunschooling. I know I did.<br/>\n<br/>\n I have felt the eletist attitude come across here too. I have felt <br/>\nit was not safe to post here. the funny thing is that I know a <br/>\ncouple people from this list in person and the reason I have not yet <br/>\nleft is because I know for sure that if they were speaking to me in <br/>\nperson that they would not be coming across as eletist. Some people <br/>\nI do not know in person have come across in posts as concerned, <br/>\nsupportive and caring. <br/>\n<br/>\nwhich has led me to wonder why the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have spent plenty of time wondering if text removes an attitude of <br/>\nconcern and instead brings in the feeling of cold indifference and <br/>\nsnobbery or if perhaps people feel that they can just lay it all out <br/>\nwithout the kind and gentle trimmings they would add if they were <br/>\nface to face.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know from working in the animal rescue field for a long while that <br/>\neventualy you get sick of people, the way they ask for advice but <br/>\ndon&#39;t take it and then continue to whine and ask for more help. <br/>\neventualy people become hardened I think, I have. any more when <br/>\nasked for advice in Animal training I tend to give it cut and dried <br/>\nand.. well cold. bare bones and I&#39;m sure bordering on bitchy at <br/>\ntimes. Perhaps this is how the &quot;old timers&quot; from this list feel. I <br/>\ncan&#39;t say.<br/>\n<br/>\nI rarely post here not because I wouldn&#39;t be getting the answers or <br/>\napproval I want, but because it does not feel like a safe place to <br/>\npost- I came to this conclusion by seeing what others sometimes get <br/>\nput through when they post- I&#39;m pretty thick skinned, but no one <br/>\nlikes to feel they are not &#39;good&#39; enough to really be part of the <br/>\ngroup. so I lurk about, trying to learn more. When I do post I let <br/>\nthe negitivity that is likely to come roll off me and try to sift <br/>\nthrough to usefull information, because ultimatly my goal is to <br/>\nlearn about Unschooling from people who do it, who live it. not just <br/>\nby reading some articles on line or a few books on the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I have come to the conclusion that Unschoolers are just <br/>\npeople.<br/>\nSome are fanatical, rigid hardline thinkers and some are flexable to <br/>\nthe point of wishywashyness. Many fall somewhere in between. Do I <br/>\nthink these descriptions make some good and others bad? no. Just <br/>\ndifferent and as is said here many more times than I can count -- <br/>\neveryone is different. we all think and learn and do things <br/>\ndiferently. Every one of you here on this list may have some peice <br/>\nof advice, some turn of a phrase that I could take into myself, <br/>\nsomthing to contribute to me to help my family. <br/>\nI learn and change by taking what is needed right now and leaving <br/>\nthe rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I leave this list now that I have said this? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, kbcdlovejo@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No one is tied up and forced to read and/or post here.
