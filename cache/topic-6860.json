Well, sadly<br/>\nthe information was stored on a computer to which we<br/>\nlost everything and I know longer have her<br/>\nhandwriting.  She had beautiful cursive, textbook<br/>\ncursive.  Well, since not sticking with it for the<br/>\npast year or so her handwriting is no longer like that<br/>\nat all. Ashamedly, I admit, I asked Brooke to<br/>\nhandwrite something to Aunt Kim.  Needless to say, my<br/>\nheart sank because she wrote beautiful at age 4-5 and<br/>\nnow, you&#39;d hardly know that she ever wrote cursive.  I<br/>\nwas at a loss and it still bothers me.  Instead of<br/>\nimproving, she&#39;s went downhill and &quot;I AM&quot; having a<br/>\nproblem getting over it.  I think that &quot;I AM&quot; having a<br/>\nproblem with pride, because instead of not caring, I<br/>\ndo care.  I care about what is thought about me as her<br/>\nmom and I care about what people think about her<br/>\nhandwriting going downhill.  However, I DO NOT WANT TO<br/>\nFEEL THIS WAY, I know that my attitude about it stinks<br/>\nand that it NEEDS to be changed. <br/>\n<br/>\nI should have never asked Brooke to write and she<br/>\nlooked sad when I asked her too, so I told her that<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t have to.  Also, I said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Brookey,<br/>\nit was wrong of me to ask you to do that.&quot;  She didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow my disappointment because I didn&#39;t show it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my attitude was wrong, but just wanted you to<br/>\nknow that you are not alone.  I&#39;m new to radical<br/>\nunschooling myself.  For awhile, I&#39;m happy and excited<br/>\nand committed, and then with one foul swoop, I LET<br/>\nmyself get intimidated into thinking it&#39;s wrong. I&#39;m<br/>\nscared that my husband will be pissed off that our<br/>\ndaughter no longer writes neatly and that he will not<br/>\nlet this unschooling continue.  He won&#39;t beat me or<br/>\nanything...LOL, but he won&#39;t see unschooling as<br/>\npositive if something was once good but has now gone<br/>\ndown hill.  Guess we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come<br/>\nto it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace and Joy,<br/>\n~Sandy<br/>\nwww.homelearningnaturally.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!

Yes - I&#39;m on several homeschool and unschool lists and I&#39;m hoping to hear from someone in VT regarding state regulations and how to deal with all that.  The only reason I&#39;m still giving them &#39;assignments&#39; is because I&#39;m worried about the repercussions next year if they don&#39;t meet whatever &#39;state standards&#39; they have to.  Since I&#39;m new to all this I&#39;m not sure what to expect. <br/>\n <br/>\nI totally agree that they would not CHOOSE to do &#39;bookwork&#39;.  The &#39;weekly&#39; outline that I gave them on the 19th is still not done - so I&#39;m being *really* lax about it.  I really  want to toss it all and let them go.  I just need to figure out how to deal with state regs first.  The LAST thing I want is to put them in the position of having to go back to ps because I screwed up dealing with the state.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m sure there are unschoolers around here and I&#39;m working the resource lists as I get them.  I just haven&#39;t gotten alot of info yet.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I said &#39;semi-engaged&#39; I didn&#39;t mean it in a negative way.  I meant that I wanted to keep them communicating with me and each other and involved in daily life.  We stick pretty close as a family and I don&#39;t like the idea of them totally disengaging.  I&#39;m sure that&#39;s one of those things we will work through over time though.  I remember as a teenager when I played video games for hours on end.  I still enjoy it - but I worry that we don&#39;t leave ourselves open to each other if we are absorbed in a game for a long time.  For me it was an escape, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the same for them, and I understand that&#39;s the point your making [regarding time to heal, etc] so it&#39;s something I&#39;m open to.  I guess it&#39;s just that I&#39;m so new to all this and I don&#39;t want to make any more mistakes - like I did leaving them in the public school system for 8 years even though I felt compelled to remove them after 2.<br/>\n <br/>\nI DO feel this *urge* to &#39;guide&#39; them into &#39;studying&#39; stuff they are interested in - a la unit studies - I&#39;m fighting that urge - really.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy progression has been this:<br/>\nThe first day of &#39;homeschool&#39; was full-blown school at home,&quot; schedule, gotta get every little thing done today, by the book, verbatim.&quot;  I didn&#39;t have fun at all, they did ok but only because it was new.  Day two - my eldest did all his work by noon, the youngest cried from lunch til dinner.  Day three - the youngest went on a work strike - I made him sit at the work table all day but he refused to do anything, just sat there and cried - it felt like child abuse.  It was about that time that I realized this whole &#39;school at home&#39; thing was not for us; but I KNOW they will not thrive in the public schools.  That&#39;s when I started reading a LOT more about this &#39;unschooing&#39; thing that was popping up here and there in various resources that I&#39;ve been reading.  So you can see - I&#39;ve only been following this for about a month.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI may not phrase things right but my heart is for my children to learn what they love and pursue it - not to make them miserable.  I think I really am in the middle of a paradigm shift (I HATE that term - lol - it&#39;s such a &#39;catch phrase): shifting from &quot;learning&quot; (i.e. educating in a tangible way) to &quot;experiencing life&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks again for being such a great resource and sounding board.  I think you will all hear alot from me over the coming months.  Please be patient, I&#39;m learning.<br/>\n <br/>\nAmber<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo! for Good<br/>\n Click here to donate to the Hurricane Katrina relief effort. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6902,"nextTopicId":6904}}
