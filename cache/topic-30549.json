I am very excited to announce several new things. <br/>\nNETSHU, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NETSHU/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NETSHU/</a> , is now open to <br/>\nchildren of all ages. It started out mainly for children 10-16 but we <br/>\nhave various ages now due to younger siblings and some families with <br/>\nyoung children only. We still hope to continue getting some older <br/>\nchildren (above 10) in the group as they seem to be the minority now <br/>\na days. But as I said we are now welcoming all ages!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the exciting part! We now have a facility for all of our <br/>\nactivities and such. We also have a Gym class lined <br/>\nup......Yayyyyyyy! I know a lot of you have been hoping for such a <br/>\nclass to help the children get the exercise they need. I will be <br/>\ngoing Saturday morning to finalize everything on use of the building. <br/>\nStarting in April we will be having some sort of activity going on <br/>\nevery Friday from 12:00 - 2:00. I am open to ideas and volunteers of <br/>\nall kind. I hope to do a cooking class around once a month, some type <br/>\nof arts & craft class once a month, Gym class once a month maybe <br/>\ntwice depending on what everyone else would like to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a million ideas running through my head and would love to hear <br/>\nfrom those of you interested in joining our Fun Fridays! We welcome <br/>\nthose from any group, you do not have to belong to NETSHU, but it <br/>\nwould be nice :) Just keep in mind we are a secular group.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease start either posting, emailing or calling me with what you <br/>\nthink. Wether you want to join in the fun, have ideas, want to <br/>\nvolunteer or anything. We are excited to finally have more activities <br/>\nfor our children to join in on!<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n423-791-5843<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CraftyGardenerTN@...\">CraftyGardenerTN@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NETSHU/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NETSHU/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30532,"nextTopicId":30464}}
