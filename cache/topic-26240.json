I can&#39;t tell for sure if you&#39;re tongue was in your cheek <br/>\nwhen you wrote this, but if not, don&#39;t give the song that much <br/>\ncredit.  Your son is who he is.

I have found it to be really helpful to remind myself <br/>\nperiodically that my son is NOT me.  We have a lot in common, it&#39;s <br/>\ntrue, but he is his own person and does many things differently than <br/>\nI do and for different reasons.  I remind myself that I am holding a <br/>\nspace for Liam to become the best *Liam* he can be, *not* the best <br/>\nMarji (I&#39;ve already got dibs on being the best Marji!!).  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has also been helpful for me to remember that unschooling is all <br/>\nabout trust and providing my son with what he needs.  Sometimes I <br/>\nhave to divine what he needs, but most of the time, he just tells <br/>\nme.  This path is Liam&#39;s path, and I see my role here as helping him <br/>\nbe on it.  Whatever he needs, I do my best to get for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I trust that Liam trusts me.  So, if, to use your example, <br/>\nthere&#39;s a danger of him overdriving his ear buds and damaging his <br/>\nhearing by playing the music too loudly, I very gently and politely <br/>\ntug his coat (as I would anyone who I thought needed the information) <br/>\nand inform him of the dangers.  He understands that I trust him <br/>\nenough to understand me and my intentions and he is always <br/>\nappreciative for the helpful information.  I give him the information <br/>\nhe needs and trust that he will act on it as he sees fit.  In some <br/>\nareas, he needs to learn for himself.  I totally respect <br/>\nthat!  Sometimes, I&#39;m ::gasp:: wrong!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were me, I would do my best to try to shift away from seeing <br/>\nhim as &quot;hyperfocusing.&quot;  I&#39;d do my best to support him (by bringing <br/>\nhim food to eat if I think he&#39;s been going without for too long or <br/>\ngently reminding him that he may want to pause and use the <br/>\nbathroom).  I&#39;d do my best to make sure he has all the tools he needs <br/>\nto fully immerse himself in his passion.  I&#39;d be his partner in the immersion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this is helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marji  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":323487745,"authorName":"Julie","from":"Julie &lt;jsweevil2@...&gt;","profile":"jsweevil1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Hyperfocusing, when is it unhealthy?","postDate":"1190069900","msgId":26331,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2RUYwNjhDLjYwMjAzMDdAZW1iYXJxbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGQzNC4xNDNiNTEzNC4zNDIwNTg4MUBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGQzNC4xNDNiNTEzNC4zNDIwNTg4MUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26330,"nextInTopic":26332,"prevInTime":26330,"nextInTime":26332,"topicId":26240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"OMG!

To tell you the <br/>\ntruth, I have in the past tried to limit his video game time to keep him <br/>\nfrom getting so obsessed over them. It&#39;s just since joining this and <br/>\nother unschooling lists that it has hit me that maybe doing that is <br/>\nentirely wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember a time when I was in my early teens when I ended up staying <br/>\nup all night long trying to teach myself how to draw horses. It was a <br/>\nschool night, and when my mother found out I had been up all night, she <br/>\nwas rather miffed at me. I tried to explain that I could catch up on the <br/>\nsleep that I had lost, but had learned something important in the <br/>\nprocess (how to draw horses).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the first time I am realizing that video gaming is what is truly <br/>\nimportant to my son. I&#39;m having difficulty getting around all the <br/>\npsychology experts saying it is an addiction, and harmful to kids...yada <br/>\nyada yada. I wanted to be an artist when I grew up, art was important to <br/>\nme, sleep wasn&#39;t. To my son, he was to program video games, so <br/>\ntherefore, learning to play video games well is important to him. <br/>\nHowever, if it is something unhealthy (not eating, not using the <br/>\nbathroom, not sleeping at all etc.) is there a point where it needs to <br/>\nbe limited, or would it be better to try and introduce him to some <br/>\nprograming software/classes/what have you to let him put that energy <br/>\ninto the &quot;making&quot; rather than only &quot;Playing&quot; videos games?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I am confusing myself here so I know I am probably confusing <br/>\neveryone else as well. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s use Julian&#39;s obsession with the Ramones as an example for a <br/>\nmoment. Is it bad for him to want to listen to the same thing over and <br/>\nover and over again? No. What if he insisted in listening to it at full <br/>\nvolume with headphones on? That could be unhealthy to the ears right? <br/>\nCause permanent hearing loss etc. Somewhere, an obsession can become <br/>\nunhealthy. If I just said Caleb, if it is important to you to play games <br/>\nthree days in a row with no sleep or food, go for it, would I be <br/>\nallowing it to go too far? He has that ability to hyperfocus just that <br/>\nmuch. Would it be wrong at his age to put limits on time spent playing <br/>\nvideo games for his own protection, or would that be squashing his <br/>\ninterests?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess you&#39;d have to be around a kid who has the capability of manic <br/>\nepisodes to understand. I know that sleep is important or can cause a <br/>\nmajor crash later on. It can cause a complete lack of need for sleep, <br/>\nfood, or basic necessities. Completely unmedicated and on a manic high, <br/>\nI can literally go days without food or sleep with little to no obvious <br/>\nproblems, but I pay for it afterwards with a major depression. The <br/>\nhigher you go, the harder you fall is pretty apt here. The same holds <br/>\ntrue for Caleb as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just never really thought about allowing him to play games until he <br/>\ngot over them before until I started reading this thread about Julian <br/>\nand the Ramones. It made me think back to my own past experiences and <br/>\nabout the analogy of learning to Draw horses and how I was proud of what <br/>\nI had accomplished, yet my mother was upset at me for not sleeping. It <br/>\nmade me take a step back and wonder if I am doing the same thing, even <br/>\nunconsciously to Caleb, or if there should be some kind of dividing line <br/>\nwhere I can tell him maybe we should put the games away for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake any sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Not in our lives.<br/>\n&gt; Could you explain what you mean by that?

When Caleb was that <br/>\nage he went through the same thing of course, I think most kids do at <br/>\nsome time, but Caleb seemed to go through it for about 6 years straight. <br/>\nHe has always loved music from the time he was an infant, and there were <br/>\ntimes when I could scream if I heard Allstar by Smashmouth ONE MORE <br/>\nTIME! However, I knew he would eventually move on to something else, or <br/>\nget a more widely varied taste in music. It happened in all due course, <br/>\nbut I think Caleb has a major issues with hyperfocusing in all aspects <br/>\nof his life. This has made me wonder what may happen once he does get <br/>\nout of PS and move into a unschooled environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf given his complete druthers over what to do during the day, it would <br/>\nmost definitely be playing video or computer games. At what age do you <br/>\ntry to prevent (if any) hyperfocusing on one thing? It kind of muddies <br/>\nthe waters a bit when the thing Caleb really wants to do with the rest <br/>\nof his life is become a computer game programmer. It&#39;s all he wants to <br/>\ndo really.

Dishwashing, laundry, or other non-essentials ;) <br/>\nin life go out the window and I feel driven to see my idea come to <br/>\nfruition.  I know how getting hyperfocused can drain you of all other <br/>\nneeds, like eating, sleeping and going to the bathroom, and Caleb does <br/>\nthe same things when he gets interested in something.

I don&#39;t agree, <br/>\nhowever, that 5 ~ or any age ~ is &quot;old enough&quot; for anything.  That&#39;s <br/>\nan arbitrary &quot;should,&quot; and I really think it&#39;s an individual <br/>\nthing.  In mainstream society, I suppose 5-year-olds are expected to <br/>\ndo lots of things they may not be ready for.  But, if a family wishes <br/>\nto eschew mainstream-thinking, these kinds of expectations have no place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that it is best for the one who has more coping tools to be <br/>\nthe one who yields.  Only Karen know how well her Julian would be <br/>\nequipped to do this now.  I like the idea of inviting him to offer <br/>\nsolutions, but when Karen wrote, &quot;Screaming. Tears. Anger...from <br/>\nJulian that is,&quot; this suggested to me that he has a need that is <br/>\ngreater than his ability to be empathic to others ~ right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt won&#39;t last forever.  Really.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be most helpful to change how Julian&#39;s &quot;demands&quot; are <br/>\nperceived.  He is adept at identifying what he needs and expressing <br/>\nit.  That&#39;s amazing and wonderful!  There will be opportunities when <br/>\nhe develops more empathy to help him mesh his needs with others&#39; <br/>\nneeds around him.  He&#39;ll develop empathy by having it modeled for <br/>\nhim, and this gives you a beautiful opportunity to do that!  But, <br/>\nthis may not be the time to force him to develop empathy (an <br/>\noxymoron).  Forcing him cannot bring him any closer to achieving that skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you can find ways to help the other kids while meeting <br/>\nJulian&#39;s needs, that will be wonderful!!

He would listen to that tune ALL day <br/>\nlong.  He learned (by himself) what that little button the CD player <br/>\nmeant with the two arrows, and then he could listen to the song over <br/>\nand over and over and over and over and...   well, you get the <br/>\npicture.  He also liked the  Jaco Pastorius composition &quot;A Remark You <br/>\nMade,&quot; and he listened to that all the live-long day.  When he, I <br/>\nmean we, wasn&#39;t listening to it, he was singing the songs, even <br/>\nthough the Pastorius comp was an instrumental.

I never asked him <br/>\nnot to listen to it or to listen to something else, but it was just <br/>\nme and him during the day and his dad when he was home.  We just <br/>\nallowed it, figuring it was obviously really important to Liam.  We <br/>\nfigured that when his need was met, he would move on, and he did.  I <br/>\nalso knew that the more I was able to *not resist* (sorry for the <br/>\nsplit infinitive), the more likely Liam would be able to move on for <br/>\nhis own reasons, rather than for reasons of resisting my <br/>\nresistance.
