We&#39;ve had one for four years and it amazes me how much time they will spend on it.  I bought it when my youngest was 4 and my oldest was 6. I was desperate to find a new, fun way to burn off some of that &#39;little boy energy&#39; . The two boys will often have some imaginary game going on between them and the trampoline it where it all takes place- I love listening to their happy chatter and watching them jump and run round and round the trampoline.  The trampoline has an enclosure so there is no danger of them falling off but now that they are older I&#39;ve noticed they are more likely to try gymnastic stunts (flips)on the trampoline . I&#39;ve had to caution them about the serious injuries that they could sustain doing flips were they to land improperly, especially on their necks.   This seems to have put an end to the stunt attempts. They had previously  been taking a gymnastics class where older children were learning t<br/>\nrampolining- I am going to ask my boys if  they would like to return to class gymnastics class this year so they can learn how to do flips properly so as to avoid injury.....  Anyhow we like the trampoline and I enjoy joining them for some exercise too!   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":299687655,"authorName":"King & Stace","from":"&quot;King & Stace&quot; &lt;ks.barnett@...&gt;","profile":"staceymoonlight","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Sleep & exercise","postDate":"1175391805","msgId":22886,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZDkwMWM3NzNmZiQyNDcxMDViMCQwMjAxMDEwYUBQZWFjZXk+","referencesHeader":"PGV1bHJkYitscWViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22884,"nextInTopic":22892,"prevInTime":22885,"nextInTime":22887,"topicId":22884,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Ness My 9 yr old daughter is the same when she doesn t get enough sleep.
