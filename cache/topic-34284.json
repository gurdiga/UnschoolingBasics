There seems to be a big difference in the *depth* they go <br/>\nand in the risks they choose to take. Cameron looks at their forays as <br/>\na &quot;scientist&quot; as well. Or maybe as a sociologist. &lt;g&gt; He does examine <br/>\ntheir choices---as well as his own---and what drives them (and him).<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* think that, if a person has nothing to rebel against, he still may <br/>\nwant to *know* what the buzz is.

(Even they <br/>\n  aren&#39;t all the same.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  But there are profound differences between schooled kids and <br/>\n  mindfully parented unschooled kids. The difference comes from knowing <br/>\n  their parents are their partners who trust and respect them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Teen rebellion is not an essential part of being a teen. It&#39;s caused <br/>\n  by control.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The unfortunate thing is is that parents think that they need to <br/>\n  control their kids until the kids stop &quot;acting up&quot;. But the acting up <br/>\n  is being caused by control and not being listened to. We don&#39;t get to <br/>\n  use mindful parenting because our kids are &quot;good&quot;, our kids are <br/>\n  &quot;good&quot; because they&#39;re mindfully parented.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; ?/ will a kid smoke<br/>\n  &gt; just cos his parents do ?/ and do we just say &#39;&#39; oh hes 15, hell <br/>\n  &gt; do it<br/>\n  &gt; anyway ?<br/>\n<br/>\n  My mom smoked.

Kids who <br/>\n  feel their parents are there to help them get what they want from <br/>\n  life, what&#39;s there to rebel against?<br/>\n<br/>\n  When parents draw lines their kids can&#39;t cross, the kids hear &quot;You&#39;re <br/>\n  not competent to handle this.&quot; It&#39;s a challenge! When we stop telling <br/>\n  them they&#39;re incompetent, when we help them find safe and courteous <br/>\n  ways to do what they want, then they challenge themselves in sensible <br/>\n  ways, rather than challenging themselves on all the things they&#39;re <br/>\n  told they can&#39;t do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: smoking cigarettes.........","postDate":"1215018867","msgId":34322,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NEFEOUYzQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":34321,"nextInTopic":34326,"prevInTime":34321,"nextInTime":34323,"topicId":34284,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So most people did.<br/>\nWhen my mom was a young teenager, growing up in Brooklyn, NY (Flatbush<br/>\nAvenue) she remembers sitting on the front steps of the house<br/>\n(brownstone row house type situation) one summer evening when the bugs<br/>\nwere coming up (skeeters and gnats and such) and a relative handing each<br/>\nof them (her and her siblings) a lit cigarette to keep the bugs away.<br/>\nAnd that started it. What ended it, according to her (I was too young at<br/>\nthe time to remember) was when I was about 2 or 3 and she was sitting on<br/>\nthe couch with my baby brother in one arm and a cigarette in the other<br/>\nhand and I asked her &#39;do you have to do that?&#39; She set about stopping<br/>\nright then. Good thing too because 3 years later, at the ripe old age of<br/>\n28, she had a stroke. Had she still been a smoker, the doctors say she<br/>\nmight not have made it. But her body had started repairing the smoking<br/>\ndamage to some extent by then and she&#39;s now 71 and loves babysitting her<br/>\n5 grandkids. My dad, on the other hand, kept smoking. The thing that<br/>\nkicked his butt was when my sister chose to go to college in northern<br/>\nFL. It was 1984/85 and planes still had smoking and non-smoking sections<br/>\nfor relatively short flights (NJ to FL is only about 2 hours or so). My<br/>\ndad got seats in non-smoking as the better choice for my mom. He had to<br/>\nget up during the flight and go back and find a spot in smoking to light<br/>\nup. That just aggravated the daylights out of him - that he had to leave<br/>\nhis wife by herself and go have a smoke on a TWO hour flight. So, when<br/>\nhe got back to NJ, he found a hypnotist/behavioral specialist who used<br/>\npost hypnotic suggestion to help with the &#39;crazies&#39; and cravings as they<br/>\nworked behaviorally to cut the strings tied to smoking one by one -<br/>\n&quot;coffee and a cigarette&quot; snip; &quot;phone call and a cigarette&quot; snip,<br/>\n&quot;driving and a cigarette&quot; snip, etc. until he could choose to smoke all<br/>\nhe wanted but not while he was actually doing anything else. Then it was<br/>\neasy to stop. It was kind of fun in a way because us kids were in on<br/>\nwhat he was doing but he was saving it as a surprise for my mom&#39;s<br/>\nbirthday which happened to coincide with the end of the process. So,<br/>\nonce a week for a couple months that summer, we &#39;covered&#39; for him when<br/>\nhe got home from work a little later than usual &quot;oh must&#39;ve been<br/>\ntraffic&quot; or &quot;he mentioned he had to do something for JTIDS (or some<br/>\nother project - we knew all the acronyms for the stuff he worked on).<br/>\nHe&#39;s now 77 going on 78.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

Hill and Kristy Chow. It&#39;s a review paper looking at the demographics of people who are likely to do risk taking behavior. It reminded me of one the reasons that people engage risk taking behavior that I&#39;d forgotten. The idea that choices based on short term outcomes trump decisions made on long term outcomes if you don&#39;t feel like there is going to be a long term.  There is a book by Jim Chisholm that looks at sexual frequency and number of partners when compared with the sense that the person being asked has of how long they will live. Or at least that is some part of the book:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/6oakpd.\">http://tinyurl.com/6oakpd.</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nCigarette smoking has benefits, not necessarily health benefits, although it does have some health benefits. Just as many risk taking behaviors do have a benefit. The benefit may be access to a certain social group or moving up in the hierarchy of that group. I smoked at 12 and it was like passport for getting me accepted into the social group that I wanted to accept me. If the short term benefits of smoking are great enough than the long term risks should be less important. And if you think you are going to die earlier than you shouldn&#39;t worry so much about the long term risks. So environment is really important to risk taking behavior. I&#39;ll quote this from the article: In a survey of women university students, their expectation of a shorter life-span was associated with more childhood stressors (such as divorce or loss of parents; Chisholm 1999b). That means that the better the home enviroment, the more likely that someone will make choices based on<br/>\n long term benefits over short term benefits. So, even if adults are smoking, if it is a relaxed home, children may not smoke. <br/>\n<br/>\n(1999b is Chisholm, J. S. (1999b) Attachment and time preference: relations between early stress and sexual behavior in a sample of American university women. Human Nature, 10, 51–83.) I wonder if that was I was thinking of rather than the book?  <br/>\n<br/>\nOhh, ohh, just found this paper by Tamas Bereczkei, whose stuff I adore: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStressful family environment, mortality, and child socialisation:<br/>\nLife-history strategies among adolescents and adults from unfavourable<br/>\nsocial circumstances Tamas Bereczkei <br/>\nJanus Pannonius University, Pecs, Hungary <br/>\nAndras Csanaky <br/>\nJanus Pannonius University, Pecs, Hungary <br/>\nThis study, based on questionnaires given to 732 subjects, usesan integrative                 approach with a focus on evolutionary(life-history) explanations. In accordance                 withBelsky, Steinberg, and Draper’s theoretical model of socialisation (1991), we claim that experiences during childhoodtrigger variations in the life                 cycle and shiftdevelopmental trajectories as adaptive answers to different environmental conditions. Unfavourable familyconditions constitute an unpredictable                 and unstableenvironment that make children susceptible to adopting opportunistic mating strategies rather than parenting strategies.Based on Chisholm’s                 statement (1993) thathigh stress in the family provides cues for local death rates, we argue that mortality rates may have a significanteffect on reproductive                 decisions, even in post-industrialsocieties. We report that length of schooling,  date<br/>\n of the first marriage, and fertility were associatedwith the                 subjects’ family conditions,such as parental affirmation, emotional                 atmosphere,parent-subject conflicts, and parental relations. Women growingup in                 unfavourable family circumstances finishschooling and marry earlier, and                 this shiftin developmental trajectory is likely to lead to the highernumber of                 children measured among these women.Men, on the other hand, do not show such a                 differencein reproductive output, which may be due to their increasedinvolvement                 in sexual competition. Remarkably,significant correlation has been found between  life-history strategy and mortality rates; those coming fromunfavourable                 environments have more deceasedsisters and brothers than others. It is possible  that individual differences in mating and parenting behaviourare still<br/>\n contingent,                 among others, on localdeath rates.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I think I&#39;ve jumped around a lot.

When we stop telling  <br/>\nthem they&#39;re incompetent, when we help them find safe and courteous  <br/>\nways to do what they want, then they challenge themselves in sensible  <br/>\nways, rather than challenging themselves on all the things they&#39;re  <br/>\ntold they can&#39;t do.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":327608745,"authorName":"ann329851","from":"&quot;ann329851&quot; &lt;annworsley991@...&gt;","profile":"ann329851","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"smoking cigarettes.........","postDate":"1214839005","msgId":34284,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc0YXRjdCtqNnAwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":34288,"prevInTime":34283,"nextInTime":34285,"topicId":34284,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"anyone managed to quit the stuff, or had comments or the kids copying mum with a pretend ciggy crayon ?/ just asking for input and ideas, as i have had an","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1592340\">anyone managed to quit the stuff, or had comments or the kids copying <br/>\nmum with a pretend ciggy crayon ?/ just asking for input and ideas, as <br/>\ni have had an interesting debate with some friends whos kids are <br/>\nschooled and have very interesting ideas as to a 15 year old and <br/>\nsmoking. what are other peoples opinions on this ?/ will a kid smoke <br/>\njust cos his parents do ?/ and do we just say  &#39;&#39; oh hes 15, hell do it <br/>\nanyway ? ann</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34123,"nextTopicId":34365}}
