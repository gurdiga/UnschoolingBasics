If my kids only learned <br/>\nwhat *I* knew, we&#39;d have pretty boring lives. Luckily, I am simply <br/>\nthe doorway through which they access the world, so I try to stay <br/>\nwide open (saying yes a lot, being interested in their interests, <br/>\nfinding creative ways to get them items and information they want <br/>\netc..).<br/>\nIf *I* was their teacher, then my oldest would certainly NOT know <br/>\nall about computers and video games and guitar and Dungeons and <br/>\nDragons and history of wars and medieval weaponry and so on....<br/>\n<br/>\nThank goodness we are all individuals that each have our own <br/>\ninterests that enrich the rest of our family.<br/>\nDoes your dh need you to teach him everything you know? Do your <br/>\nfriends? Of course not. Your children don&#39;t either. So you have a <br/>\ndeficit in math. What caused that?<br/>\nWas it pure genetics? Or perhaps some really crappy school <br/>\nexperiences that made you believe you had to be taught math? That <br/>\nyou couldn&#39;t possibly understand all that material without great <br/>\nstruggle?<br/>\nI venture to guess that most of us blocked up by math were schooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo school didn&#39;t work very well to teach you math. And now you think <br/>\nthat school methods will somehow help your children learn something <br/>\nyou struggle with? How does that work?<br/>\nIf schoolish methods work, then they work? If they don&#39;t work, then <br/>\nwhy are you trying to bring them home?<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I&#39;ve asked you a lot of questions....I&#39;ll back off now.:)<br/>\nHow about read an article for me, about how children learn when <br/>\nthey&#39;re interested. It&#39;s a schoolish method used, but ONLY on <br/>\nchildren that WANTED the lessons.<br/>\nSo far, my children use numbers happily and readily, because it&#39;s <br/>\njust another part of their lives. If they want to attach formal <br/>\nwords and equations to the stuff they&#39;re already familiar with, <br/>\nthink of the advantage they&#39;ll have over schooled kids that have <br/>\nbeen taught all their lives that it&#39;s DIFFICULT to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sudval.org/05_onli_11.html\">http://www.sudval.org/05_onli_11.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if it makes you feel better, read about Laurie Chancey, who did <br/>\nnot memorize her multiplication tables, never had a math lesson in <br/>\nher radical unschooled life, and did (and is doing) fabulous in <br/>\ncollege:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chancey.info/unschooling.html\">http://www.chancey.info/unschooling.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy goal is not to turn out academically &quot;educated&quot; individuals. My <br/>\ngoal is to help my children live the life of their choosing as <br/>\nhappily as possible, which I believe will lead to a wonderful life <br/>\njourney.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"not anti-unschooling","postDate":"1104635744","msgId":4532,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNyN3AxMCtsaWV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4533,"prevInTime":4531,"nextInTime":4533,"topicId":4532,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It seems to me that unschoolers in general get very upset when people question them-or maybe I am just taking it the wrong way I think you re just not seeing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1861109179\">&quot;It seems<br/>\nto me that unschoolers in general get very upset when people question<br/>\nthem-or maybe I am just taking it the wrong way&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re just not seeing it from the other side (well...that&#39;s <br/>\nunderstandable).<br/>\nIf you&#39;re saying that unschoolers get &quot;no help&quot; that&#39;s a bit <br/>\ndisrespectful to all the wonderful parents here that spend day after <br/>\nday making sure their kids have access to the whole, wide world!!<br/>\nI know it isn&#39;t meant as a put-down, but things that newbies ask can <br/>\nsure come across that way sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think unschooling leads to poor jobs, or lack of math skills <br/>\nor an inability to get a GED etc....then you&#39;re basically saying <br/>\nthat the lot of us unschooling parents don&#39;t care about that stuff! <br/>\nOf course we care about our children having wonderful lives, that&#39;s <br/>\nexactly WHY we unschool.<br/>\nMaybe when you word things, just ask HOW it works, rather than <br/>\nassuming all these negatives about unschooling like we haven&#39;t <br/>\nthought all that through.<br/>\nDoes that make sense?<br/>\nAsking &quot;HOW do kids learn math without lessons and structure?&quot; is <br/>\nbetter in my opinion than saying &quot;I have horrible math skills so how <br/>\nwill an unschooled child learn math?&quot; (duh, you went to school!!:) <br/>\nwink, wink.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4531,"nextTopicId":4537}}
