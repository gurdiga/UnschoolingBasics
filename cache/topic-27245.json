That was something I found *myself* doing when we <br/>\nfirst got Netflix, and then again when I discovered fantasy role-<br/>\nplaying computer games (there aren&#39;t nearly enough of these!) I had <br/>\nbeen &quot;trained&quot; to think that movies and shows and games were somehow <br/>\nless than reading, but when I was able to step away from that I <br/>\ncould see how I was choosing to watch and play the same sorts of <br/>\nthings I would choose to read. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my first post, here, I think, and I really liked this point, and <br/>\nwanted to add a smiliar one about writing.<br/>\n <br/>\nI write *all* the time, in my head.  I think up ideas, connect them and <br/>\norganize them, but I just don&#39;t always feel the need to write them down and share <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve discovered my 11yo daughter does the same thing, it&#39;s just disguised as <br/>\nplaying with stuffed animals.  Most people interpret this as &quot;she loves <br/>\nanimals and will probably grow up to be a vet.&quot;  But that&#39;s not really it.  She&#39;s <br/>\nwriting.  She&#39;s creating characters.  They each have their own separate <br/>\nidentity, she imagines what each one would say to each of the others in various <br/>\nsituations and settings.  She thinks up plots and works out conflicts.  It&#39;s all <br/>\npart of the writing process, it&#39;s not all that visible unless you&#39;re looking for <br/>\nit because so much of it is happening *inside* her head. <br/>\n <br/>\nHer friends do the same thing, and recently they started having e-mail <br/>\nconversations between the animals.  So then it was obvious.  I could see her sitting <br/>\nat the computer typing up dialog in each character&#39;s particular voice and <br/>\nseeing *in writing* (proof!!!) that it really is writing.  But by then I didn&#39;t <br/>\nreally need the proof, because we&#39;ve been doing this long enough for me to <br/>\nlearn to trust that valuable things are happening in her head, all the time, and <br/>\nthat each thing doesn&#39;t have to lead to something more &quot;productive&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;schooly-looking&quot; to be worthwhile.<br/>\n <br/>\nPatty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27217,"nextTopicId":27140}}
