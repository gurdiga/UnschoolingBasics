I was just befuddled over whether anyone had seen any of my<br/>\ncontributions to the list, and had wanted to erm, nicely, say it without<br/>\nprojecting the appearance of a whiner ;-)  ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it&#39;s tricky when some lists specifically want introductions.  Hard to <br/>\nkeep it all straight.  This list gets so busy sometimes it&#39;s hard to keep up <br/>\nwith the changing flow of discussion and side discussion let alone <br/>\nintroductions.  I like introductions!   I just don&#39;t remember who&#39;s who <br/>\nuntil I&#39;ve read their stuff for awhile.  Lot&#39;s and lots of people probably <br/>\n*can* remember new members based on their introductions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s not a necessary part of participation on this list.  Nice, but not <br/>\nnecessary.  Anyway, glad you&#39;re here!<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20119,"nextTopicId":20192}}
