(yes, you can all applaud now!)  I will boil it down to this -<br/>\n<br/>\nWaldorf is very rigid.  These schools have a very specific <br/>\ncurriculum about what to teach, when to teach it, and how.  They <br/>\nalso are big believers in delayed academics (as in, first grade <br/>\nbegins AFTER the child has seen 7 springs - and not before)  Many <br/>\n(and I&#39;m generalizing, so take this with that in mind) Waldorf <br/>\npeople would actively discourage any kind of early academics, even <br/>\nif the child wants them.  These things are my biggest beef with <br/>\nWaldorf.  I do, however, love the stories, the valued play and the <br/>\nartistic quality.  These are things that we can incorporate on our <br/>\nown, however, without a curriculum saying I can only use 1 or 2 <br/>\ncolors of paint in Kindergarten, and it has to be this kind, using <br/>\nthis kind of brush, etc....<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if any of you are Waldorf teachers, remember, this is just my <br/>\nopinion - don&#39;t beat me up!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Mason, my biggest problem (again) is a set course of study - <br/>\nBUT, Mason was a homeschooler, and was therefore more applicable to <br/>\nmy situation.  If I needed a course of study, I might chose that.  <br/>\nBut it&#39;s not about me - I want my kids to chose their own courses of <br/>\nstudy (that&#39;s why I&#39;m here!)  I do like Mason&#39;s nature journal idea, <br/>\nand although I would never force it, I will bring some paper and <br/>\npencils along on a hike, just in case anyone asks ;)...  I also like <br/>\nthe idea of learning history through literature rather than <br/>\ntexbooks...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite thing about BOTH of these approaches is the emphasis on <br/>\nrespecting the child.  I do, however, think that in order to TRULY <br/>\nrespect your child, you have to become an unschooler, using whatever <br/>\nyou know to broaden their experiences and opporitunities.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I&#39;m just figuring this all out - and loving every minute.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a nutshell, everybody brings something to the picnic, but <br/>\nultimately, you gotta chose your own lunch!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am in awe of you all who are on this path - it is truly a gift to <br/>\nbring to a childhood.  I&#39;m literally GULPING every piece of <br/>\ninformation I can find, and realizing that this is not going to come <br/>\nfrom a book, it has to come from me - that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been on here <br/>\nbegging for help in learning to do that - and I thank you all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to be so long-winded - blame Anna - she asked!!! :) :) (LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nPenny<br/>\n<br/>\nPS:  I wish we lived closer too - I loooooove England!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265615958,"authorName":"anna_mumx5","from":"&quot;anna_mumx5&quot; &lt;as007i0152@...&gt;","profile":"anna_mumx5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: My intro (and boy am I happy to be here!)","postDate":"1156265559","msgId":16641,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVjZmNvbisybGhlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVjZDh0aCtpcHI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16640,"nextInTopic":16646,"prevInTime":16640,"nextInTime":16642,"topicId":16626,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Penny, I enjoyed reading about your journey.

I am thrilled to <br/>\n&gt; find you all - I feel like I&#39;m home!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve been homeschooling for about 3 years, during which time I have <br/>\n&gt; learned about just about every kind of curriculum imaginable (and <br/>\n&gt; bought most of it to, which explains my embarrassing credit card <br/>\n&gt; debt...) and lots of educational styles.  I have tried Charlotte <br/>\n&gt; Mason, Montessori, classical and a LOT of Waldorf (which I thought <br/>\n&gt; was relaxed, but it&#39;s actually the most rigid of the bunch).  I <br/>\n&gt; would learn everything I can, put everything in place and within <br/>\n&gt; months abandon them.  Why?  They never felt natural, or right, or <br/>\n&gt; well, healthy. (Although, I must admit, it WAS a fun journey for me <br/>\n&gt; to learn about them, even though they were disappointing when I <br/>\n&gt; tried to implement them).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It was actually John Holt&#39;s book &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; that inspired me <br/>\n&gt; to homeschool, but I rejected unschooling because I lacked the <br/>\n&gt; confidence to believe in it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ...and then my daughter wrote a 10 page book about unicorns for her <br/>\n&gt; sister&#39;s birthday...just because she wanted to, and it&#39;s the best <br/>\n&gt; bit of work she&#39;s ever accomplished...and I had NOTHING to do with <br/>\n&gt; it!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I put away the spelling and grammar workbooks, math is next.  My <br/>\n&gt; current struggle is to figure out how to encourage without sounding <br/>\n&gt; like I&#39;m assigning - if anyone could help me with that I&#39;ll be <br/>\n&gt; grateful...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t mind a few deschooling tips (for MY deschooling) <br/>\n&gt; either... if anyone can share...I&#39;m having an awfully hard time not <br/>\n&gt; relying on a math text - even though I hate teaching that way...I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; getting better though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t tell my daughter.  When she asked if we were going to do <br/>\n&gt; math I asked her &quot;didn&#39;t we bake today?&quot; - and when she asked about <br/>\n&gt; spelling I said - &quot;if you need to know how to spell something the <br/>\n&gt; dictionary is in the living room&quot;.  Then I told her to go outside <br/>\n&gt; and play, at which point she found some slugs, looked up some info <br/>\n&gt; in a book about them and drew a picture.

Part of your job  <br/>\nis to run the parts of the world you think might interest them  <br/>\nthrough their lives so they have access to new interests. The other  <br/>\npart is to walk along beside them as they explore, being their  <br/>\nresource. You don&#39;t always need to be physically *at* their side! ;-)  <br/>\nThey do need time to explore on their own. But have an awareness of  <br/>\nwhat interests them and what they need, an awareness of when they  <br/>\nneed you to be with them and when they need the space to try things   <br/>\nout for themselves.

Treat everything like that. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your mind you&#39;re still dividing the world into &quot;needs to be  <br/>\nlearned&quot; and &quot;fun&quot; and you&#39;re afraid she won&#39;t be interested in the  <br/>\nstuff that &quot;needs to be learned&quot; so you feel the need to encourage her.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreat it as all as potentially interesting to them. Part of your job  <br/>\nis to run the parts of the world you think might interest them  <br/>\nthrough their lives so they have access to new interests. The other  <br/>\npart is to walk along beside them as they explore, being their  <br/>\nresource. You don&#39;t always need to be physically *at* their side! ;-)  <br/>\nThey do need time to explore on their own. But have an awareness of  <br/>\nwhat interests them and what they need, an awareness of when they  <br/>\nneed you to be with them and when they need the space to try things   <br/>\nout for themselves.

Not only does it help them, as a side  <br/>\neffect, understand learning by living life, it will make them smile :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When she asked if we were going to do<br/>\n&gt; math I asked her &quot;didn&#39;t we bake today?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To her the word &quot;math&quot; means workbooks because that&#39;s how you&#39;ve  <br/>\ndefined it for her so far. So a more understandable answer would have  <br/>\nbeen &quot;Do you mean math lessons? Nope! Not unless you want to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUp to this point you&#39;ve said with your actions (and maybe words too)  <br/>\nthat she needs to do workbooks and textbooks in order to do math. By  <br/>\nasking &quot;Didn&#39;t we bake&quot; it sounded like she should already have known  <br/>\nthat math is baking. And she probably left confused (and perhaps  <br/>\nrelieved that you were confused about &quot;math&quot; today.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to teach her how to unschool ;-) *She* already knows!  <br/>\nHer natural understanding was just getting confused by what you&#39;ve  <br/>\nbeen saying (in your actions) so far. If she&#39;s expressing something  <br/>\n&quot;wrong&quot; (in terms of natural learning) about learning, then more than  <br/>\nlikely it&#39;s an idea she&#39;s learned from you. Be gentle with her!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and when she asked about<br/>\n&gt; spelling I said - &quot;if you need to know how to spell something the<br/>\n&gt; dictionary is in the living room&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which might have sounded to her like &quot;I&#39;m not going to help you any  <br/>\nmore.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s *really* hard to hear what our words sound like from our kids&#39;  <br/>\npoints of view!<br/>\n<br/>\nA better way of phrasing it is &quot;If you need help spelling a word just  <br/>\nask. If I don&#39;t know I can look it up.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Then I told her to go outside<br/>\n&gt; and play, at which point she found some slugs, looked up some info<br/>\n&gt; in a book about them and drew a picture.

Until tainted by boring lessons, *everything* is  <br/>\npotentially interesting, even George Washington. But not everything  <br/>\nwill interest them right now. Imagine (or maybe physically carry  <br/>\naround chips!) that the kids give you only 5 &quot;Here&#39;s something  <br/>\ninteresting,&quot; chips to spend. Every time you play a chip (point  <br/>\nsomething out) and they walk away bored, you lose the chip. Every  <br/>\ntime they&#39;re interested, you get to keep the chip and gain an extra  <br/>\none. If you run out of chips it&#39;s because you&#39;re still in &quot;this is  <br/>\nimportant to know&quot; mode. To make up for it, you need to go find a  <br/>\ncartoon you think they&#39;ll like ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227473922,"authorName":"psmbegan","from":"&quot;psmbegan&quot; &lt;pennyegan@...&gt;","profile":"psmbegan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"My intro (and boy am I happy to be here!)","postDate":"1156196081","msgId":16626,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVjZDh0aCtpcHI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16633,"prevInTime":16625,"nextInTime":16627,"topicId":16626,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello everyone!
