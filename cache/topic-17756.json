They have similar <br/>\nlives to cows, pigs, sheep, ect. with the exception of their size.<br/>\n<br/>\n It took us a year to commit, but we love them! We have three <br/>\nbrothers, one for each child. We get them out and handle and play <br/>\nwith them often. And the kids have learned a lot about what it takes <br/>\nto care for live stock on a small scale. And since we handle them <br/>\noften, they sleep on our laps and cuddle with us as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have the yard space, you can make a rabbit proof fencing pen <br/>\nthat is a great place for them in nice weather. We have some friends <br/>\nwho keep them outside or in the garage year round, but we expanded <br/>\nour cage into a larger area so they can be inside. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll our pets think their people! We take commitments to our pets <br/>\nvery seriously. My hubby is very big on a clean house with no fur, <br/>\nso with the dogs and cat we have to vacuum a lot. But the parakeet <br/>\nwe rescued has a big cage, the fish have a big tank and the piglets <br/>\nhave the guest room! We are buying land next January. We have <br/>\nalready heard jokes from friends about how many pets we might end up <br/>\nwith. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny, when people come over to our house they see the two <br/>\nsmall dogs and assume that&#39;s it. Then they&#39;ll hear the bird or <br/>\nguinea pigs(they purr and squeak) and want to see all the pets! I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think we could handle anymore. And hubby is real big on the <br/>\nhouse smelling clean as well, so reptiles are out for the most part. <br/>\nBut we live on the edge of a creek and rural area, so we get to see <br/>\nour share of snakes, frogs, turtles, ducks, raccoons, and coyotes! <br/>\nIt great to observe them from the upstairs balcony late at night. <br/>\nLast year we watched a baby skunk for over an hour while it <br/>\nmeandered around the field in the moonlight. I woke the kids up to <br/>\nsee it and they still mention it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, whew, that was a ramble!<br/>\n<br/>\nWildflower</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17706,"nextTopicId":17765}}
