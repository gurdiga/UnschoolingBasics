I guess I just wanted confirmation from you unschoolers.Most of the moms in my local homeschooling support group do school-at-home, so I feel isolated and have very little support when it comes to unschooling my kids.  I guess that&#39;s why I second-guess myself and still struggle with my traditional ed. and traditional parenting mentality.  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; So now, you got this as one of your choices:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &quot;pull Miguel out of the school (and they&#39;ll refund us the last couple of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; months&#39; tuition)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Why wouldn&#39;t you take him out today?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, we are seriously thinking about pulling him out of school.  It&#39;s just that I&#39;msurrounded by friends, who are school-at-home-moms, and one of them told me that when a friend of hers did just that, her son was OK in the beginning because he was younger.  But later on, when he was older, he began to think that his parents didn&#39;t have much confidence in him to leave him in the school and come out strong, despite the difficulties he experienced there.If you or anyone in the list could clobber this piece of advice, I would be very grateful.  Because my gut instinct says, pull him out of school.  But it&#39;s advice like this that make me pause and wonder.Thanks for taking the time to read through my posts -- I really appreciate it!Shelley<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39197,"nextTopicId":39200}}
