But maybe her young teens are getting to the point now that they feel the need to get comfortable with math in a more formal way?  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor us math in life and formal, written math operations proved to be two different questions.  Fun at home with games and building or sewing projects, fun along the road trusting the math instinct, sure. There are maps to read, shopping to do, currency to convert in all sorts of adventures we&#39;ve had and &quot;math&quot; was never a thought or care. Absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the time may come when your older unschooler asks for help developing formal math skills as a means to some end. Passing standardized entrance exams for college and graduate school, for example, which for us turned out to be a whole different kind of unschooling question.  Trust it can be done of course but it may take a little (school)work along the road. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a specific set of math conventions associated with scholastic goals, maybe like fluency in a new dialect or language, translating natural math thinking to spoken and written expressions in SchoolSpeak.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHelping a teenager who has done cooking and shopping fractions and percents but never drilled arithmetic or performed written algebraic equations, convert those rich unschooling adventures to specific preparation for a computerized algebra entrance exam to community college (for example) is a little different sort of parent question. Now what?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne option is the immersion approach, where a confident unschooler plunges unprepared into a formal school environment without a clue what anybody is saying at first, and can&#39;t even understand what&#39;s being asked at first, much less what the answers are. I know this works well for some people, with both language and math. It was a nightmare for my daughter and we had to keep open to other school resources to help her along HER road.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO I like the idea of unschooling math as a long road-trip, not just as actual journey such as Nancy&#39;s family is taking, but as metaphor too.

Off the top of my head I can think of three things that would have math value in what you do:<br/>\n- learning about different currencies and exchange rates <br/>\n- figuring out distances traveled and how much more to travel<br/>\n- everyday shopping <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, that would already be plenty to learn more math than any curriculum you could carry.<br/>\n<br/>\nBea</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":346500999,"authorName":"nancyrsv","from":"&quot;nancyrsv&quot; &lt;sathren@...&gt;","profile":"nancyrsv","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Roadschoolling mom checking in","postDate":"1253200853","msgId":41517,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg4dGs0bCtmcnEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg4dDlxYitjYWJjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41514,"nextInTopic":41529,"prevInTime":41516,"nextInTime":41518,"topicId":41514,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I suppose I should put this in since I ve already had a couple ladies write and ask me...

I&#39;ve been reading your discussions for the past couple of days and have found them pretty enlightening!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m Nancy and we are &quot;Roadschooling&quot; our twin boys while we ride our bikes the length of the Americas.  We left from Alaska 15 months ago and are now in Colombia.  Along the way, the boys are mostly learning from Mother Nature and our journey itself.  We have opted to carry math books for them since we didn&#39;t feel they would get what they needed in that regard from the journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I most likely won&#39;t be all that active here as my internet time is usually quite limited, but I&#39;ll be browsing through your posts in my email.  Keep up the fascinating discussions - you&#39;ve already challenged my thinking in a number of ways!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41554,"nextTopicId":41512}}
