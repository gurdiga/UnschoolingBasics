Sometimes it&#39;s a sign that he&#39;s at a transition - we&#39;ve heard that more in the last year I think than ever before. He&#39;s just turned 13 this summer and is at that neither fish nor fowl stage. He&#39;s not a little kid anymore but he&#39;s not quite sure of the footing ahead of him, he&#39;s kind of feeling his way into who and what he wants to be next on his journey. I have learned (sometimes painfully) that my best answer to &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; (and its cousin &quot;I have no idea what I want to do now&quot;) is &quot;Okay, come give me a hug&quot; Even at 13, nearly as tall as I am, he&#39;ll come snuggle on my lap (if I&#39;m sitting) or we&#39;ll have a big long hug, no words necessarily, just a hug.
