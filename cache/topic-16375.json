It&#39;s SO much like when our babies<br/>\nwere babies and they would have a &quot;fussy crying irritable nothing<br/>\npacifies them but the breast (maybe)&quot; sort of day.  This was usually<br/>\nfollowed by some profound developmental change - a word comprehension,<br/>\ncrawling, sitting up, walking, a motor skill refinement, etc.  It<br/>\nseems logical that this would continue into &quot;kidhood&quot; and &quot;teendom&quot; as<br/>\nwell.   I&#39;ve seen it often in Emily, who as a baby was the one that<br/>\nhad the most &quot;off kilter&quot; days.

Since we&#39;ve taken on this unschooling lifestyle, we had seen <br/>\nless and less of these episodes.

I&#39;ve been giving him choices, setting him <br/>\nfree from the expectations we used to have, and remaining calm. The <br/>\nonly thing I&#39;m taking up with him is that it&#39;s not ok to be nasty to <br/>\nhis brother (demeaning, insulting, etc) or anyone else. Once the <br/>\nepisode has passed and he&#39;s back to himself, he apologizes profusely <br/>\nand will say &quot;I don&#39;t know why I acted that way. I&#39;m sorry&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n.. I&#39;m getting to my point here... <br/>\nToday, we went to a good friend&#39;s birthday party. Christian had <br/>\ndecided to go and there were lots of friends of this girl and her <br/>\ncousins there. Christian stayed back and to himself while I was <br/>\nwatching the kids in the pool. It was wild, rambunctious play and <br/>\nhe&#39;s not always comfortable in those types of intense situations. He <br/>\nthen came up to the pool, watched what was going on and decided he <br/>\nwanted in! I was kind of surprised, briefed him on what may happen <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s in the pool, he was ok with that and he joined in. <br/>\n<br/>\nLong story .. ok, LONG.. LOL he had a great day with little, if any, <br/>\naltercations and he didn&#39;t lose his cool. Lots of times he&#39;ll feel <br/>\nthe play very personal and then turn it into a vendetta type thing <br/>\nand he feels very unreachable to me then. That didn&#39;t happen. He had <br/>\na wonderful day, interacted and enjoyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe did fall apart a little on the way home but it was short lived, <br/>\nhe apologized and we were home in no time to fix the situation (he <br/>\nwas very upset to have to sit in a wet bathing suit for the 5 minute <br/>\nride home)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m getting at is that it&#39;s nice to watch this lifestyle in <br/>\naction, working. Tomorrow, we&#39;re going to the RI shore with friends <br/>\nand we are all looking forward to it. Just a note: He apologizes on <br/>\nhis own. There&#39;s no guilting or expectation of an apology.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarm regards,<br/>\nTonya</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16409,"nextTopicId":16415}}
