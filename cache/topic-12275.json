Nrityagram is the only dance village in the world, it <br/>\nexists solely to preserve and popularize the 7 classical Indian dance styles and <br/>\n2 martial dance arts. The mostly female dancers spend yrs. perfecting their <br/>\ncraft and technique. The ensemble is known primarily for it&#39;s commitment to <br/>\nOdissi dance form. &quot;Scared Space&quot; is a presentation of 7 dance segments based on <br/>\nIndian poetry and mythology, that aims to recreate an energy field or sacred <br/>\nspace through the Odissi dance tradition. What a beautiful dance! We all decided <br/>\nthat we felt like we were in a trance and &quot;in another place&quot; the whole time <br/>\nwhile watching it. It was SO cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe then went a few blocks over to an Indian restaurant for lunch (yummy!) and <br/>\ncame home and made some Masala Chai tea from a recipe they gave us and I <br/>\nthought I would pass it on to all of you. (you may already have it or one like it, <br/>\nI think I remember seeing a recipe here once, but I figured it wouldn&#39;t hurt <br/>\nto share just the same!:o) <br/>\n<br/>\nMasala Chai<br/>\n4 c. water<br/>\n4 c whole milk<br/>\n1/2 t. cardamom seeds<br/>\n1/2 t. whole black peppercorns<br/>\n1/2 t. whole cloves<br/>\n1/2 cinnamon chips<br/>\n1 star anise<br/>\n1 whole nutmeg<br/>\n1t. peeled & minced fresh ginger<br/>\n1 Madagascar Bourbon vanilla bean, chopped fine<br/>\n4 t. black tea leaves, strong, robust tea works best<br/>\n8 oz grade &quot;A&quot; honey (I always use raw)<br/>\n<br/>\nBring the water and milk to a boil in a scaucepot. Add the remaining <br/>\ningredients, except honey, turn the heat down to a simmer, cover and steep for 10-15 <br/>\nmin. Remove from heat and strain. (try using a coffee filter if needed) Add <br/>\nhoney and mix well. Store in refrigerator. Can be served hot or cold.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you enjoy it as much as we did! <br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12310,"nextTopicId":12297}}
