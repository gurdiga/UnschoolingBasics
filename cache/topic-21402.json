It&#39;s<br/>\ninteresting to note that while the Jugendamt<br/>\ndetermined she was developmentally delayed by one year, German <br/>\nchildren undergo strict assessments around 5th grade which determine <br/>\ntheir overall intellectual and educational abilities. It is based on <br/>\nthis assessment that students are sent to one of three levels of <br/>\nschooling:<br/>\n1. Gymnasium - this is the highest, most challenging level of<br/>\neducation and the ONLY path to university level studies. It has 13<br/>\ngrades as opposed to the American 12.<br/>\n2. Realschule - this is a &quot;technically&quot; inclined education. Not to be<br/>\nconfused with an &quot;IT&quot; trade school. Youth attending this school<br/>\ngenerally attend less than 13 years, do not have the option to attend<br/>\nuniversity with this diploma (though they can voluntarily apply to<br/>\ncomplete Gymnasium).<br/>\n3. Hochschule - this school traditionally only goes to grade 9,<br/>\nthough in recent years it&#39;s become more fashionable for students to<br/>\ncomplete 10 grades. Students in this school could generally be<br/>\nconsidered &quot;at or below average&quot; and are headed for an apprenticeship<br/>\nin a trade position, most typically some type of manually labor like<br/>\nconstruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, on the surface not a totally bad system as, unlike the US<br/>\nsystem, it doesn&#39;t automatically try to force children onto a path for<br/>\ncollege when they may actually be more successful and happier in a<br/>\ntrade job. It does however, confine them to trade jobs carries a<br/>\ncertain degree of &quot;class&quot; distinction.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my point though:<br/>\nThe GERMAN EDUCATION SYSTEM is the one that determined this girl<br/>\nbelonged in Gymnasium. They are the ones that educated her. They<br/>\nare the ones that apparently failed, if she&#39;s now considered behind<br/>\nby one year.<br/>\n<br/>\nGermans do tend to put &quot;delayed&quot; students into a &quot;Sonderschule&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;Special school&quot; and yes -- it has all the nastiness of<br/>\nthe &quot;short bus&quot; attitude. Many children end up in &quot;Sonderschule,&quot; in<br/>\nfact, for health reasons. I know of children who were epileptic.<br/>\nOtherwise perfectly healthy, intelligent and capable children, but<br/>\nbecause of the risk of seizure deemed not appropriate for placement<br/>\nin the general school environment. These otherwise &quot;normal&quot; children<br/>\nwere thus confined to a classroom with children who were, in part,<br/>\ngreatly mentally and physically challenged. The message is clear and<br/>\nwhile I&#39;m not one to scream &quot;Nazi&quot; at the drop of a hat, it<br/>\ndefinitely smacks of the same flavor of human worth classification.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I read in another article mention of a loud classroom<br/>\nenvironment and cancelled classes. I dare say I question whether a<br/>\nloud classroom environment claim has any merit whatsoever; however, I<br/>\nam familiar with the German practice of simply not holding class when<br/>\na teacher is unavailable rather than bringing in a substitute. This<br/>\nhas always astounded me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I question the slant with which some of the information has<br/>\nbeen presented, I believe the facts are to be found and they are<br/>\nindeed not pretty.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that illuminates for someone who might take interest.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"Nance Confer","from":"&quot;Nance Confer&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"nanceconfer","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"This is scary...Germany and homeschooling","postDate":"1171462438","msgId":21416,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwN2UwMWM3NTA0MiQ1ZWMzMDA1MCQ2NDAyYThjMEB5b3VydzA0Z3R4bGQ2Nz4="},"prevInTopic":21402,"nextInTopic":21417,"prevInTime":21415,"nextInTime":21417,"topicId":21402,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Consider the source. http://www.wnd.com Nance Cocking A Snook A Blog for Thinking Parents http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/ [Non-text portions of this","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1864478715\">Consider the source.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wnd.com\">http://www.wnd.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\nCocking A Snook<br/>\nA Blog for Thinking Parents<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/\">http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":292658207,"authorName":"Shellini Spencer","from":"Shellini Spencer &lt;shellini@...&gt;","profile":"shellinispencer","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:This is scary...Germany and homeschooling","postDate":"1171455731","msgId":21419,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlFMDUyQjNCLUMyQTItNDNDQS05MzZELUJGNzc5Q0ZFREM4RUBvcHRvbmxpbmUubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":21417,"nextInTopic":21443,"prevInTime":21418,"nextInTime":21420,"topicId":21402,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi MIk!

It is running more and more to tyranny and<br/>\ndictatorship.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWND reported  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=54082\">http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=54082</a>&gt; more<br/>\nthan a week ago that German authorities had assembled a team of about 20<br/>\npolice officers and other officials to take the teen from in front of her<br/>\nshocked family. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was taken on a judge&#39;s order to a psychiatric ward after a diagnosis of<br/>\n&quot;school phobia,&quot; according to reports from German homeschool supporters. She<br/>\nhad fallen behind in Latin and math studies, and was being tutored at home<br/>\nin the subjects. However, when school officials found out, they expelled<br/>\nher, then took the family to court when they began homeschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe court order executed by police officers said, &quot;The relevant Youth<br/>\nWelfare Office is hereby instructed and authorized to bring the child, if<br/>\nnecessary by force, to a hearing and may obtain police support for this<br/>\npurpose.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHer father, Hubert Busekros, told the homeschool group the state was out of<br/>\nline with its &quot;zealous drive to enforce compulsory schooling.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe initially was hospitalized in the Child Psychiatry Unit of a clinic in<br/>\nNuremburg, but then moved without notice, officials with<br/>\nNetzwerk-Bildungsfreifeit said. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week, the  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=54135\">http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=54135</a>&gt; Home<br/>\nSchool Legal Defense Association launched a campaign to have its supporters,<br/>\nmostly in the United States, contact the German embassy about the case. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThen officials with the International Human Rights Group said they had<br/>\nassembled a list of German officials to contact on behalf of the teen. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInformation about the case can be found in English at<br/>\nNetzwerk-Bildungsfreifeit,<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wnd.com/redir/r.asp?http://www.netzwerk-bildungsfreiheit.de/html\">http://www.wnd.com/redir/r.asp?http://www.netzwerk-bildungsfreiheit.de/html</a><br/>\n/pe_erlangen_en.html&gt;  officials said. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The State&#39;s action clearly goes beyond what is justifiable. They took<br/>\nunreasonable measures for which they had no basis. They intimidated the<br/>\nfamily with a &#39;SWAT&#39; team of 15 police officers to take captive a 15-year<br/>\nold unsuspecting girl early in the morning, taking her to a state<br/>\npsychiatrist,&quot; according to the IHRG. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The psychiatrist, after hours of interrogation, wrote a report which<br/>\nclaimed that Melissa had delayed educational development of one year and<br/>\nschool phobia. The judge, basing her decision on this report, gave the<br/>\ncustody of the child over to the state and placed the child in a psychiatric<br/>\nward. This was all done in a sped-up action taking only four days. The<br/>\nfamily is devastated and has immediately appealed the judge&#39;s decision,&quot; the<br/>\nIHRG said. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This is nothing else than deprivation of liberty and child abduction,&quot; the<br/>\nGerman homeschool group said. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOfficials there said historically the German phobia about homeschooling<br/>\nbegan with Adolph Hitler, whose design was to control the minds of children<br/>\nas they grew, leaving them with only his worldview. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The &#39;Jugendamt&#39; (youth welfare office) has its origin in the German Nazi<br/>\nstate,&quot; the German group said. &quot;German Wikipedia writes about the Jugendamt:<br/>\n&#39;In 1939 the Jugendamt [was] adopted ... as a part of government in the<br/>\nNS-state control of child-education. The Jugendamt controlled and observed<br/>\nfamilies and children politically from their birth.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA spokesman for the group told WND, &quot;Today the Jugendamt  is free to take<br/>\nthe children away from their parents when in their opinion the child&#39;s<br/>\nwelfare is jeopardized. A false accusation of neighbors is sometimes<br/>\nsufficient to capture the children from their parents.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe students&#39; rights and human rights groups say they still want people to<br/>\ncontact German officials about the situation: Contacts, provided by the<br/>\nIHRG, include: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYouth Welfare Office<br/>\nDirector: Edeltraud Höllerer <br/>\nRathaus<br/>\nRathausplatz 1<br/>\n91052 Erlangen<br/>\nTel. +49 9131 86-2844<br/>\nFax +49 9131 86-2438<br/>\nMail: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:edeltraud.hoellerer@...\">edeltraud.hoellerer@...</a><br/>\nOr <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stadtjugendamt@...\">stadtjugendamt@...</a><br/>\nResponsible Official<br/>\nMonika Muzenhardt<br/>\nMail: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:monika.muzenhardt@...\">monika.muzenhardt@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nMayor of the Town of Erlangen<br/>\nDr. Siegfried Balleis<br/>\nRathausplatz 1<br/>\n91052 Erlangen <br/>\nFon: +49 [0] 9131 86-0<br/>\nFax: +49 [0] 9131 86-26 92<br/>\nMail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ob@...\">ob@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLocal Court Erlangen<br/>\nFamily court<br/>\nRichterin Frank-Daupin<br/>\nMozartstraße 23<br/>\n91052 Erlangen<br/>\nTel. +49 9131-782 01<br/>\nFax +49 9131/782-361<br/>\n(No Email address available)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMinister of Justice in Bavaria<br/>\nBeate Merk<br/>\nPrielmayerstr. 7<br/>\n80335 München<br/>\nTel. +49 89 5597 1799<br/>\nFax +49 89 5597 3580<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beate.merk@...\">beate.merk@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nClinic Nürnberg-Nord/Psychatrie<br/>\nProf.-Ernst-Nathan-Str. 1<br/>\n90419 Nürnberg<br/>\nchief physician: Prof. Jörg Wiesse<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joerg.wiesse@...\">joerg.wiesse@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAssistant Medical Director<br/>\nDr. Schanda<br/>\n(Responsible for the survey of Melissa)<br/>\nTel: 0911-398-3877<br/>\nFax: 0911-398-3261<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KJP_B@...\">KJP_B@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:axel.froelich@...\">axel.froelich@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Our prayer is that we can work together to end this nightmare for this<br/>\nfamily.
