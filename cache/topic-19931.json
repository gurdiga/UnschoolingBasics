Newsprint is cheap as most newspaper offices<br/>\nwill give or sell it cheaply (I think our newspaper sells end rolls<br/>\nfor $3-$5 and there is still quite a bit of paper left on the roll).<br/>\nTape it to your walls.  Let him go to town!  My kids love wall art<br/>\nbecause it is big and wide and they aren&#39;t limited by an 8.5 x 11<br/>\nsheet of paper.  It also is easy to clean up.   Another idea is to<br/>\npaint a wall or section of a wall with chalkboard paint and get him a<br/>\nbig box of colored chalk.  Again this is giving him a place to create<br/>\nthat is for him.  If you own your own house consider painting his room<br/>\n(or the hall or another wall that you are willing to give him) with a<br/>\nsemi-gloss or gloss paint and just resolve to the fact that when you<br/>\nmove or he moves out of this stage you will just paint the wall, but<br/>\nbeing gloss has a better ability for cleaning if need be before then<br/>\n(those magic erasers will take off almost anything from the walls!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dream has always been to have a &quot;quotes wall&quot;  Grafitti in the<br/>\nhouse.  A plain colored walls that friends and family and guests can<br/>\nwrite quotes on.  Big, small, fancy, in their own handwriting or<br/>\nfonted.  Quotes on paper could be glued on or mearly tacked or taped.<br/>\nMarker, paint, crayon, I don&#39;t care the medium.  I&quot;m a tad older than<br/>\nyour son and I still want to write on the walls :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:OT-drawing on my walls","postDate":"1166556086","msgId":19938,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1MjYyRkM4QEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":19934,"nextInTopic":19940,"prevInTime":19937,"nextInTime":19939,"topicId":19931,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t think it s too young in some ways and it is in other ways (how s that for a non-answer lol).

What is it he gets out of it? <br/>\n <br/>\nFor instance, painted walls or wallpaper have different textures, the<br/>\nwriting looks different there. If that&#39;s related, maybe get some<br/>\ninexpensive (free) wallpaper samples or sections of board you can paint<br/>\nand hang as &quot;art areas&quot; in various places. Paint over it (primer<br/>\nnecessary) whenever it starts getting crowded - maybe take a digital<br/>\nphoto of it first. <br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s just handy when he has an idea right at the moment and &quot;can&#39;t<br/>\nwait&quot; to find paper to sketch it out. If that&#39;s the case, maybe creating<br/>\nsafe to draw on areas in each room - using chalkboard paint for instance<br/>\nor putting up whiteboards or wallpapering a section with a sheet of the<br/>\nbrown butcher paper stuff (we have several rolls, it comes in packs of 4<br/>\nor 6 rolls at Sam&#39;s Club and other places).<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, put any permanent inks up or remove them from the house and leave<br/>\nmore readily washable writing implements at hand for a while.<br/>\n <br/>\nBack long ago when I was in college, they were coming through to repaint<br/>\nthe dorm hallways and public areas. Since they had to prime it anyhow,<br/>\nthey gave us notice as to when they would be by for that and said Go<br/>\nahead and write on the walls if you want, the primer will cover it. So<br/>\nwe did - we got pens and markers and made a huge mural all down the<br/>\nwalls. Then they came and painted over it. It was really fun - and I was<br/>\n19 at the time!<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

One <br/>\nthing that is bothering me though is my almost 4 year old thinks he should <br/>\nbe able to draw on anything.  I find his name and other letters, skulls and <br/>\ncrossbones, ships, rockets on the walls, the furniture, the floor.  I never <br/>\nsee him doing this, just walk in the kitchen to get something and come back <br/>\nand there it is.  He is very proud of his drawings and claims them <br/>\neverytime.  My dh gets angry so i try to keep it cleaned up but some of it <br/>\nwont clean off some surfaces and like he gouged marks with a pen in our <br/>\ndresser.

Words are everywhere and he notices them, reads them, sounds them out, asks questions every day. He reads some books when he wants too, reads the monopoly cards, but he still is not a confident reader yet. He is ok with this, I am ok with this. Recently he was in a local Nutcracker production. Each group hangs out together when not on stage and play games. They were all playing apples to apples and the leader, a young 14 year old happily read to my guy as needed, no big deal. However, when my son asked a peer to read something for him, she made a big deal about him not being able to read. She went so far as to say, &quot;Is it because your stupid?&quot; My guy responded with grace, as he does, and told her he homeschools, and reading isn&#39;t required at a certaim age... But I was wondering, I want to give him some quick line that gets the point across, shuts down the negative confrontation and helps my guy feel ok<br/>\n with himself. Something like &quot;many great men have been later readers and I intend to be one too.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts for me to pass to him?
