My sons love rearranging things in the house!  I find that I need to do this for them a couple of times each month.  My sister does it weekly because they are at home about 90% of the time.  When my house is a total mess, I usually get things going by reorganizing a closet or room.  This gets everyone&#39;s energy going and I get some extra help : )<br/>\nJeanette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys are switching rooms in anticipation of the baby, (my oldest<br/>\nasked for the smaller room so &quot;baby stuff&quot; didn&#39;t go in his room, oh<br/>\nand IF we painted it red and he could sleep in the closet!)  Anyway...<br/>\nwhile cleaning the rooms I had bought some giant bins at BigLots for<br/>\ntoys because the stairs are becoming a problem for me.  Up and down up<br/>\nand down!  Plus when the baby comes I&#39;d rather sit at the table with<br/>\nthem, then on their floors.  Now their toys are organized and in bins<br/>\nin the dining room.  Including a half a ton of Lego&#39;s.  But guess<br/>\nwhat?  They are playing together, more often, and I&#39;ve even gotten in<br/>\non the building.  They love it.  They&#39;ve been playing Lego&#39;s,<br/>\nHeroscape, and duplo blocks for days now.  I also organized a big<br/>\ngame/art shelf and suddenly they are enjoying each other&#39;s company<br/>\nmore often on that too. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I found when my kids got their OWN rooms, they started fighting<br/>\nMORE.  This is when possessiveness actually took over.  I heard a lot<br/>\nof &quot;It&#39;s my room!  Get out!&quot;  There were LOTS of hurt feelings.  My<br/>\npoint is that having the &quot;community area&quot; of toys downstairs in the<br/>\nmiddle of &quot;life&quot; has been a wonderful solution for us. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n. <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32474,"nextTopicId":32794}}
