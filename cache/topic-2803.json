If a child has interest in something, or sees a need for information because it will help them with an interest, they&#39;ll absorb it readily. We&#39;re all like that. That&#39;s the way humans are. <br/>\nMake a list for yourself of all the jobs you&#39;ve done for pay, the ones you&#39;ve volunteered, all of the hobbies you&#39;ve had or plan to have and then ask yourself how much of this stuff you learned in school?<br/>\nUsually none or just a few. And of the few that you might have learned in school, it&#39;s only because the school happened to be teaching something you were already interested in.<br/>\nThings like reading, math, writing, come along as people are exploring their interests. Focusing on &quot;teaching&quot; those as subjects, only sucks the joy out of learning.<br/>\nListen to your child, he already knows how to be an unschooler...kids are naturals that way.
