I would check with the state department of education and find out what your state and district requirements are. (if any).  My daughter got a job at 14 and it involved filling out the district&#39;s work permit application, and then getting the employer to sign off on it, and then going back to the district and filing the form. Here in CA we can file a form establishing our home as a private school (R4 form) and then we grant our students the work priveleges just as any public or private school would. It was pretty easy, but the district imposed a rule saying she could not work between the hours of 8 and 3 or some nonsense, but fortunately her employer ignored that because as my daughter explained &quot;the form is written for people in formal schools and does not really address the needs of homeschoolers. &quot; <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n -------------- Original message ----------------------<br/>\nFrom: &quot;caradove&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:caradove@...\">caradove@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My oldest is near 12yo, and he has asked me several times if he has to<br/>\n&gt; go to school to get a work permit at 16yo.
