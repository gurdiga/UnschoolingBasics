He was extremely violent.  He destroyed 16 doors in 4 years <br/>\nof marriage and celebrated beating our second child out of me when he <br/>\ncaused me to miscarriage.  I have never regretted divorcing him, but <br/>\nhave regretted that the legal system doesn&#39;t allow children to <br/>\ndivorce bad dads.  I know.  I&#39;ve lived it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven after he told his only child that he was going to kill her (and <br/>\na list of others including me)there was no legal protection.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has never regretted the divorce nor has she ever thought <br/>\nit was her fault.  Granted, these are not the average divorce <br/>\nsituations.  My mom and lawyer, had advised me to never bad mouth <br/>\nhim.  He would show himself for who he is all on his own which he did <br/>\nmore times then I care to count.  My daughter has never felt that she <br/>\nwas the cause of divorce.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy step-daughter, who&#39;s parents never married, was always told the <br/>\ntruth of &quot;how&quot;.  She has four parents and three she knows love her.<br/>\n(I can&#39;t speak for her step-dad and they tend to fight so I won&#39;t)<br/>\nShe, also, doesn&#39;t feel any of it was her fault.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, speaking to children, and being honest, can go along way <br/>\nto helping them not feel it&#39;s their fault.  My lawyer had also <br/>\nadvised to make it available to children to have stamps and envelopes <br/>\nso they could mail school work, art work and other things to the <br/>\nother parent to help avoid this situation of guilt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToday, my daughter faced the worst tragity of her young life.

So these kids have to live with guilt that they helped tear their own world apart, and fear that it could happen again. This is really not just my opinion; it is substantated by decades of research. So these kids are under tremendous pressure already to somehow be very careful not to &#39;wreck things like they think they did before.&#39; When we tell them their feelings are the wrong feelings to have, we remove from them any tools to heal. Feelings really can&#39;t be adjusted externally. However, behavior can, sometimes at great cost to the self and to trust. So he may eventually learn to hide how he feels from you, or forget how to tell what he really is feeling. Are these desirable outcomes?   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Joyce Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, March 9, 2007 3:45:46 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Children of Divorce was Re: cant always get whatcha want<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mar 8, 2007, at 4:58 PM, The Jeffrees wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &quot;didn&#39;t they love me enough to stay married to each other?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a worry in the backs of their minds: &quot;If they can stop loving <br/>\neach other, can they stop loving me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Children of Divorce was Re: cant always get whatcha want","postDate":"1173437146","msgId":22046,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFDMDU0NEFELUNBQTUtNDRFMy04QjZCLTQzMTQ5Qjk4RjE4QkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwYmYwMWM3NjFjYyRlNTNjMzdhMCQ4NDc4ZmVhOUBiaWdwb25kPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwYmYwMWM3NjFjYyRlNTNjMzdhMCQ4NDc4ZmVhOUBiaWdwb25kPg=="},"prevInTopic":22029,"nextInTopic":22075,"prevInTime":22045,"nextInTime":22047,"topicId":22029,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Both of our children (now 9 and 7) recognise that something is *wrong* with their grandparents not being married to their original partners without ever having been told that by ourselves or anyone else (to my knowledge).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen parents divorce it&#39;s not just the event of the actual divorce which impacts the children. There is a whole range of other events involved which happen on a daily basis. ESPECIALLY for a child who&#39;s parents divorced very early in their life there is the constant question of &quot;was it my fault?&quot; I have heard that from my step-daughter who is now 18 (her parent&#39;s divorced when she was 3). There are also the questions (amongst many others of); &quot;why don&#39;t my parents love each other any more?&quot;, &quot;why do they get so angry at each other?&quot; &quot;why can&#39;t I have my mummy and daddy to myself like (some) other kids?&quot;, &quot;didn&#39;t they love me enough to stay married to each other?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy for us to stand externally and say that the child is lucky to have 4 parents who love them and indeed when my step-children&#39;s mother has tried to cause trouble for our family (she and my husband were separated YEARS before we met and she&#39;d since been married another two times) I&#39;ve often said &quot;why can&#39;t she accept that her children have 4 parents who love them and not make them feel that they have to choose?&quot; However, children quite simply recognise that the &quot;regular&quot; form of a family is not something that they have and they naturally wonder why.<br/>\n<br/>\nKindest Wishes,<br/>\nAnita<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Shellini Spencer <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, March 08, 2007 11:07 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: cant always get whatcha want<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  So we teach him that is <br/>\n  is lucky to have 4 loving parents and not just 2...
