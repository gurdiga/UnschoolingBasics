We&#39;ve always been open about body parts and functions;<br/>\nit&#39;s the sexuality and relationships that gets complicated. I think a<br/>\ngreat deal of my problem (for verification) isn&#39;t that ds and I can&#39;t<br/>\ntalk about the body, physical health and even political issues<br/>\nsurrounding sex like birth control, abortion etc. It&#39;s more of not<br/>\nknowing the line between healthy looking at pictures, and then abuse<br/>\nand being scarred for life. My abuser used porn as a gateway, and the<br/>\nlonger the abuse when on, the less mainstream it became. And of course I was curious, but in hindsight, 12 yos shouldn&#39;t be reading about<br/>\nundesired bondage and wound infliction as part of their introduction to<br/>\nsexuality! What was the term...something more &quot;vanilla,&quot; I guess. And part<br/>\nof my baggage is that my mother (at some point) knew what was going on<br/>\nbut didn&#39;t have the desire or courage to step into and lose a boyfriend<br/>\nover it. So as a mother figure, I needed someone to step in and protect<br/>\nme; and as a mother now, I&#39;m not sure where that point is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI do worry<br/>\nbecause in our homeschool group, it&#39;s all guys. I worry that I&#39;m not<br/>\nproviding enough social interaction to develop relationships, but he<br/>\nreally doesn&#39;t seem to seek out social interactions IRL. Someone said<br/>\nthat just because he&#39;s looking doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s wanting to meet girls,<br/>\nand that&#39;s useful to know. Anyone have a script for me to bring up THAT<br/>\ndiscussion. &quot;I noticed that you&#39;ve been looking at x, is there<br/>\nsomething I can help you find? Are you looking to meet some new friends<br/>\nof the girly persuasion?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the<br/>\nguy/girl thing, I hope I didn&#39;t offend. I do not discriminate based on<br/>\nsexual preference...just with things being so complicated<br/>\nalready...sigh. So that&#39;s normal too?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lastly,<br/>\nthe legal issues do bother me some, privacy and tracking on certain<br/>\nwebsites, so Christy and Schuyler&#39;s advice was particularly helpful.<br/>\nThanks so much, everyone, I&#39;ll look into the books mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37772,"nextTopicId":37791}}
