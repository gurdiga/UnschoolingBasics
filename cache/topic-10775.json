","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1049662777\">That was funny. The earlier cartoon had me thinking about socialization this past few days.  Your cartoon reminds that what school socialization really means.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Just yesterday we met another Mom and her two boys (same ages as my boys) at the local children&#39;s museum.  It was our 2nd regular playdate, after 18 mos of not seeing each other.  We had both brought an assortment of snacks, and were all sitting down at the playground.  When the food started to come out, it was met with kids saying, &quot;that&#39;s two for me and two for [friend&#39;s name]&quot; and &quot;we have more burritos at home, we&#39;ll bring them next time&quot; and &quot;I know -- we could plan what to bring and then everyone could share!&quot;  from the kids.  Every comment was generous and thoughtful, and all the food was shared equally by the kids -- with no prompting or organization from the Mom&#39;s.  The kids played well together.  I said to the other Mom, &quot;And they say kids who don&#39;t go to school don&#39;t have any social skills.&quot;  We had to laugh because there were four boys, sharing food, playing together, talking to us and other adults they ran into during our time there (about 4 hrs) and having a great<br/>\n time.  My boys have never been to school, her older one went to kindergarten for about one semester, so this isn&#39;t something they learned in school. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
