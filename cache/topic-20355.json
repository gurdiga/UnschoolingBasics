It was <br/>\njust that, my own personal experience. My parents taught me a million little <br/>\nthings that I use every day in the advancement and betterment of my own <br/>\nchildren. My parents, to my memory, never told me no. And for the most part, <br/>\nthat worked. But I personally wish they had said no to me more often because <br/>\nin my day to day life now I hear it. In all fairness, I lived in a commune <br/>\nfor most of my early years and that isn&#39;t the same for my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI belong to a group of adult unschool grads. This is a common issue that we <br/>\nall share, not being prepared for people not to respect our opinion. When <br/>\nput in a situation under authority it was/is a big adjustment for myself and <br/>\nothers. And when people told us,&quot;No.&quot;, it was really a shock to hear when no <br/>\nexplanation was offered. I have experienced and have heard that the ability <br/>\nto say no is difficult when you didn&#39;t hear it as a child. I&#39;m certainly <br/>\nwilling to concede that it may be an isolated group. I only know what is <br/>\ntrue for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned much about unschooling from these fellow unschooled adults. <br/>\nReserving the right to say ,&quot;No.&quot; without giving a detailed list, or even a <br/>\nnot so good reason is a simple reality for me. I want my children to <br/>\nsay,&quot;No.&quot; when they don&#39;t want to do something. And they don&#39;t always have <br/>\nto give a reason and neither do I.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also encourage and practice sharing our feelings when someone tells us <br/>\n,&quot;No.&quot; so that we don&#39;t use it as a crutch to be rude or lazy. We&#39;re a <br/>\nhuggy, feel good, bunch at my house, and we always try to at least be <br/>\nconscience of each other feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the concept that kids need to hear ,&quot;No.&quot;, for their own good. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink you should find occasions to say, &quot;No.&quot; I think we both agree that <br/>\nthere is enough natural situations that &quot;No.&quot; happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think we (Deb and I) are on a closer idea about this than appears. <br/>\nSome words just have a bigger impact than others, but they are just words. I <br/>\nrespect your opinion and it has given me pause to re-examine my thought on <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue Peace!<br/>\nWildflower<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:d.lewis@...\">d.lewis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;unschoolingbasics&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: No<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sat, 6 Jan 2007 18:10:49 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;***&quot;No.&quot; has a vast number of meanings given the context in which<br/>\n&gt;it is said.***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The website referenced in the post to this list is about saying no to<br/>\n&gt;children as in denying children the things they want, as in &quot;tell them NO<br/>\n&gt;for their own good.&quot;   What are some of the vast meanings within that<br/>\n&gt;context?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;***Again, if  children don&#39;t  learn to hear it used in the appropriate<br/>\n&gt;context, they won&#39;t know to use it<br/>\n&gt;that way.***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can think of no situation in which a hearing, English speaking child <br/>\n&gt;would<br/>\n&gt;never hear the word &quot;no.&quot;   Are you really saying you believe children must<br/>\n&gt;be told &quot;no&quot; in order to understand the meaning of the word ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Deb Lewis<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCommunicate instantly!
