When <br/>\nshe first ended school last June, she spent the every day on the <br/>\ncomputer (Toontown at first, then found World of Warcraft, also some <br/>\nvideo games here and there).  I think it&#39;s really hard to trust the <br/>\nwhole concept of unschooling when you pull a child from school and <br/>\nhave not lived an unschooling life from day one.  It&#39;s hard to <br/>\nbelieve that they WILL find their way.  And it&#39;s not that <br/>\nshe&#39;s &quot;done&quot; with the deschooling process by any means, and that <br/>\nshe&#39;s all of a sudden saying &quot;OK Mom, I&#39;m ready to get back to those <br/>\nfractions I had trouble with last year in 6th grade&quot;!  Not at ALL!  <br/>\nIt&#39;s about her learning to trust herself and becoming an active <br/>\nparticipant in her own learning.   Remember, when they&#39;re in school, <br/>\nevery minute of every day they&#39;re told what to do, when to do it, <br/>\nhow to do it, etc etc.  For real learning to occur, in a way that&#39;s <br/>\nvalid for each child, they need to let go of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve certainly had my moments of doubt, but I come here for <br/>\ninspiration and words of wisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I see her growing and learning things everyday, maybe not like the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>kids in school.

Ive always had an unschooling heart but untill last week my daughter was in school by choice. <br/>\n  I invite you to join me in learning to let go. Give yourself permission to not be frustrated. Give youself permission to support your daughter 100% in whatever she chooses to do at this time. You may see if she is interested in subscribing to a gaming magazine. Go online with her for tips on game play. <br/>\n  Dont bug but be there to talk to her if she wants to tell you what she acomplished on the game today or whatever. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  As far as thinking she is going to want to play on the computer all day instead of holding a job. <br/>\n  Well first of all public schoolers are the worst on not wanting to hold down a job. I have to have a bit of sympathy esp since I was one. The have already had to work for 10 years when they become old enough to actually get paid for it. <br/>\n  A trend I notice with unschoolers is becoming more creative about how they gain employment and becoming employed doing something they are passionate about. As a result they have a much better work ethic, keep their jobs longer and enjoy doing them a lot more. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  If you arent ready to fully let go then think of it like this ...there is what ? not quite 3 months of ps left? No child will become horribly behind or off grade level in a couple months ......I dont care what the schools try to tell you. Then they would be out for summer anyway. So commit to letting go for 6 months.........I do hope you will be glad you did. <br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

Eventually, she will have her fill of computer time and feel ready to venture away from that for other things.  Have you offered fun alternatives for her to do?  Not &#39;here, leave the computer and spend time learning something&#39; but &#39;hey, how about we hit the mall to window shop and people watch?&#39; or the park, or ice rink, or bowling alley or anything else you think she might enjoy doing.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  The learning will follow -- it&#39;s impossible to be alive and not learning something all the time. Really.  So, while she&#39;s deschooling, spending her days however she does (computer, etc) you can take that time to read, read, read about unschooling, deschooling, trusting your children and the like.  Try www.sandradodd.com and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a> and www.unschooling.info and Danielle Conger&#39;s website (don&#39;t have that addy handy, but someone else will I&#39;m sure).  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  ******<br/>\n   <br/>\n  And if I let her do this she is going to grow up not wanting to go to work and just sit home and veg in front of the computer all day. <br/>\n<br/>\n  ****<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Speaking as the Mom of one child who spent 11 years in school before coming home, I can tell you this is exactly the desire of kids forced to spend 11 years in school -- sit in front of the computer all day, escaping from the demands of the life and process forced on them by the adults.  If you think school is damaging, flawed and dangerous (I know it is) why ever would you bring that into your child&#39;s home?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  <br/>\nI want to take some what of an unschooling approach but for our very strongwilled child we need some sort of guidline limits as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  What you shared doesn&#39;t give me any indication she&#39;s a &#39;strong-willed&#39; child.  Which, by the way, I consider to be a good thing.  It&#39;s funny, as a society we call a child strong-willed only when his desire differs from ours.  If she were as focused on &#39;learning something&#39; or excelling in school as she is in playing on the computer, it would be called &#39;determined&#39; or &#39;disciplined.&#39; <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Rather than being an exhausted and frustrated Mom, you could drop the expectations and chooose to be a joyous Mom, expectantly awaiting the next amazing thing your child finds to explore with that strong will.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Mom to Will (21) Andy (9) and Dan (5) <br/>\n     <br/>\n  The future is not someplace we are going to, <br/>\n  But one we are creating.<br/>\nThe paths to it are not found but created, <br/>\n  And the activity of creating them, <br/>\n  changes both the maker and the destination.<br/>\n-John H.
