","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-495806882\">Sandy<br/>\nActually we are Spiritualists. The only church that &quot;allows&quot; us a space<br/>\nto hold our conventions is the Universalist church in our state capitol.<br/>\nSpiritualists believe in life after death, spirit communication (which<br/>\nmy family and I practice), and &quot;do unto others as you would have them do<br/>\nunto you.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;T&quot; now has two therapists. He works with a group he is teaching him<br/>\nsocial skills 4 afternoons a week. This group would like to see him get<br/>\ntherapy around his sexual identity issues. He is not a feminine acting<br/>\nboy, except when he dresses feminine. He has a crush on a girl at<br/>\nschool. He is almost 9. I am so happy for him, that people are enabling<br/>\nhim to explore his life without harrassment, punishment, degradation,<br/>\netc. I take the unschooling stance that he is who he is and this is<br/>\nworth exploring. When we take one persons right to be who they are away,<br/>\nwe take everyones rights away. I have been learning also, which is good.<br/>\nI used to think crossdressing had something to do with a persons<br/>\nsexuality and learned that it doesn&#39;t, etc. He is still young enough<br/>\nwhere he can be sheltered from the masses. Eventually - I think when he<br/>\nis a teenager - he may want to wear female clothing in public. He<br/>\nalready asks if he can grow his hair out long or wear a dress outside.<br/>\nI said yes to the hair, no to the dress. <br/>\nA young man from our state made headline news across the nation wearing<br/>\na dress to school a couple of years ago. When I was at Costco two weeks<br/>\nago I over heard a mother and son having a conversation. He seemed about<br/>\n13 years old. I heard his mother say, &quot;We just moved to a new town, you<br/>\nare in a new school, let&#39;s not start that...&quot; He was looking at female<br/>\nHalloween costumes. Sad that we tell people not to be who they are out<br/>\nof fear. On some level, it is necessary though.
