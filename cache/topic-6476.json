I asked Valerie if I<br/>\ncould help out in some way long-distance, whether by sending some money or<br/>\nin any other way, and wanted to forward her response in case anyone else<br/>\nwould like to help out too.  Money would be great, but I know emotional<br/>\nsupport would also be greatly appreciated.  Valerie&#39;s email address (and<br/>\nPaypal account, if anyone&#39;s so inclined)  is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:valerie@...\">valerie@...</a>.  ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************************************************<br/>\nThat would be wonderful and appreciated. I haven&#39;t asked for money.  I&#39;m<br/>\ntrusting it&#39;ll come to me some way. I had 3 of the women (who are living<br/>\nwith me now) go with me to the Lake Charles civic center today. There are<br/>\nseveral thousand people there. We have a list of the needed items and saw<br/>\nhow organized the whole thing is. Everyone was so calm and busy, even though<br/>\nthey&#39;ve lost everything they own, their homes, jobs, etc. The three women<br/>\nthat went with me, have seen their places of employment in the French<br/>\nQuarter (on the news) and realize those jobs are gone, because the buildings<br/>\nhave either burned or are flooded beyond help. They&#39;ve seen their<br/>\nneighborhoods and know all is lost. So heartbreaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had everyone get together this morning and discuss needs. Some needed<br/>\nmeds. The Walgreen&#39;s stores are filling all prescriptions for free. We also<br/>\ndiscussed how to best get along in this tiny house, everyone doing their<br/>\npart, etc. We&#39;re like a commune from the 60&#39;s here now, and it&#39;s working<br/>\nwell. We do realize that we have to watch our pennies and our moods, and<br/>\nthink in terms of &quot;us&quot; instead of &quot;me.&quot; So far, so good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m staying calm, but can&#39;t watch too much of the news, or I won&#39;t stay that<br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nlove, Valerie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6470,"nextTopicId":6479}}
