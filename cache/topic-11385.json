What would you do with the kids if your home was a hotel  and your town was brand new to you? Maybe they&#39;d want to hang out in the room for awhile. Maybe swim a little. Maybe read a fun trashy novel. Play some video games? A leisurely lunch? A stroll through downtown? A movie? A tourist trap? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter exactly what you do. You just need to relax and get in vacation mode. Once you can get to that state of mind, the ideas for even more exciting, interesting, fun and creative things will bubble up from all of you. But you&#39;ve got to relax first. School and school at home puts a strain on family relations and a person&#39;s ability to think for themselves.

The more complex answer is working towards<br/>\nself-discovery.  Deschooling evolves into unschooling.  So as they deschool<br/>\nand get comfortable with unschooling they are going to start venturing out<br/>\non their own.  Where you come in is when they say, &quot;I&#39;m bored.&quot;  That&#39;s when<br/>\nyou can offer suggestions.  Start with the question, &quot;What is it you want to<br/>\ndo?&quot;  If they still say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; then offer a suggestion such as &quot;Do<br/>\nyou want to create something or be entertained or be physical?&quot;  From there<br/>\nyou can narrow down what it is they want.  My teen goes through periods<br/>\nwhere she will say she is bored and what she really means is that she is<br/>\nrestless.  She needs to go outside and do something physical or she needs to<br/>\ncreate.  Static activities aren&#39;t working for her such as reading, games,<br/>\ntv.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you had the Teenage Liberation Handbook recommended yet?
