As far as the matches, surely he&#39;s old enough to light candles<br/>\nwithout an adult right next to him? We simply ask that the kids let us<br/>\nknow when they light a candle and that we dont&#39; light them in rooms<br/>\nthat nobody is going to be in (or blow them out if leaving the room<br/>\nfor good).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also ask that nobody use matches or stoves when we&#39;re gone, for<br/>\nobvious reasons. So maybe if you just point out that it would be<br/>\nbetter for an adult that knows how to handle an extinguisher (maybe<br/>\nshow him how to use one too) available when he&#39;s using matches, that<br/>\nwill be enough.

He doesn&#39;t want to <br/>\ngo anywhere.  We are deschooling and he is spending alot of time on <br/>\nthe computer and that is fine with me.  My 10-YO usually wants to <br/>\ncome along but sometimes he wants to stay home too and I don&#39;t feel <br/>\ngood about leaving them home alone together, so I talk my youngest <br/>\ninto going with me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 12, I remember coming home after school everyday and being <br/>\nalone because my mom worked.  But this last time I left my 12-YO home <br/>\nalone, there was a pile of lit matches next to a candle on the dining <br/>\ntable.  We keep the matches put away in a box and he had found them.  <br/>\nHowever, we have been letting him light a candle at dinnertime (a <br/>\nritual we just recently started) and he said he didn&#39;t know he wasn&#39;t <br/>\nsupposed to light them, although I have told him before he can only <br/>\nlight the candle when we are in the room watching.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, about 3 afternoons a week I leave the house in the afternoons <br/>\nto run some errands.  I try to think of things my oldest son might <br/>\nwant to do to get him to come along, but he just doesn&#39;t seem <br/>\ninterested.  My great-grandma (who&#39;s 102!) is in a nursing home and <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t want to go with me to visit her and I can&#39;t say I blame <br/>\nhim due to the environment, but I feel sort of bad dragging my <br/>\nyounger son along.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19227,"nextTopicId":19139}}
