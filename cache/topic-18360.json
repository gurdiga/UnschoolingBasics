We actually have a shooting range and host skeet shooting gatherings.  All my kids have had weapons training and firearms education.  My 16 dd, has a collection of throwing knives, hatchets, and stars.  My spouse has a collection of blowguns among his other various collections.  We even shoot air balls with airzookas and megazookas (this one is great for the 2yo as he can learn to cock it)  *** My spouse highly reccommends the air and mega zookas****  We have paint balls, airsofts, trapshooting, bows & arrows, crossbows, bow-staffs, to name a few &lt;g, does anyone see a continuation of my spouses playground?&gt;  If it&#39;s a boy toy, we got it (I think).<br/>\n <br/>\nThe funny thing is that my 8yo ds still has his preferred stick sword and a curved stick that was made into a bow.  Those are still his favorites over all the plastic guns, light sabers, wooden swords, airsofts or real weapons.  Guess weapons isn&#39;t really a big thing here, as they don&#39;t compare to the remote control airplanes, trucks, cars, boats and submarines, etc...<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for the hitting,  if they hit someone, they lost the toy.  Period.  After awhile, they may get it back.  Very rarely was there a repeat offense.  Airsofts are fun, however being hit in the eye could cost you your sight. Therefore, strict rules are to be followed for everyone&#39;s safety and fun.<br/>\n <br/>\nRen, my spouse loved your idea of the padded weapons.
