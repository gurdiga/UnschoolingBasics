Which is\r<br/>\ncommon.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTraditional parenting is all about force, control and &quot;making&quot; kids do\r<br/>\nthings by use of punishments/rewards. The parents decide, the child\r<br/>\nobeys. This goes on all day long, day in and day out. The children\r<br/>\nhave little or no real control over their life. They may be allowed\r<br/>\nto have pseudo-choices such as &quot;You can wear the red jacket or the\r<br/>\nblue jacket but you WILL wear a jacket.&quot; (or my favorite, &quot;You can\r<br/>\neat all your veggies or you can get a spanking&quot;) But other than that\r<br/>\ntheir days consist of being bossed around by the parent or other adult\r<br/>\nauthority figures. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhat this creates in the child is a strong opposition or counterwill\r<br/>\nin order to maintain their sense of self. It is this dynamic that for\r<br/>\nthe most part is missing in unschooled children. And it is this\r<br/>\ndynamic that makes it difficult for traditionally parenting families\r<br/>\nto find solutions other than using coercive methods. In the sunscreen\r<br/>\ncase, counterwill would make finding a solution near impossible simply\r<br/>\nbecause the issue is not about sunscreen but about the child asserting\r<br/>\nhis automony. And since the parent will not let the child be\r<br/>\nautonomous, there really is no solution. The parent and child will\r<br/>\nclash and whoever is more forceful will prevail. Even if the parent\r<br/>\noffers alternatives, such as a T-shirt, the child will still say no\r<br/>\nbecause the child is using this as an opportunity to deliberately\r<br/>\noppose the parent. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis type of incident occurs because the entire relationship is based\r<br/>\non control and force. Parents and children who unschool base their\r<br/>\nrelationship on love and respect. When children are not being forced\r<br/>\nto do things, counterwill is not triggered in the child. When\r<br/>\nchildren are treated with respect, solutions can be reached. \r<br/>\nUnschooling parents strive to not make demands or issue orders to\r<br/>\ntheir children. Despite the fact that we are bigger and stronger than\r<br/>\nour children, we try our best to not use this force to get our own\r<br/>\nway. Our children relish their automony and respect us because we\r<br/>\nrespect them. And they call us on it when we are using force with\r<br/>\nthem and we apologize! \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhat this creates is a wonderful, joyous, loving climate in which\r<br/>\nsolutions can be found. It also simplifies the problem. An\r<br/>\nunschooling family struggling with finding a solution to sun burn is\r<br/>\njust dealing with that - the sun burn. Optimally, they are not\r<br/>\nstruggling with the whole force/control/counterwill issue that a\r<br/>\ntraditional family would be dealing with. So the child really can\r<br/>\njust make a choice. He doesn&#39;t have to choose not to put on sunscreen\r<br/>\nas a way to assert his will as opposite to his mother&#39;s. He can\r<br/>\nchoose to put it on just because it would be a smart thing to do. And\r<br/>\nhe can choose to not put it on just because he really hates the feel\r<br/>\nof it. Mom probably has a preference but she isn&#39;t going to impose it\r<br/>\non him. And she certainly isn&#39;t going to coerce him.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo traditional parents always ask what boils down to the same\r<br/>\neither/or question: Either you make your child do (whatever) or you\r<br/>\nlet them kill/hurt/maim/burn themselves. In their reality, that is\r<br/>\nall they know. There is no other choice. And really, I think, it is\r<br/>\nprobably true. For a parent and child locked in a battle of wills,\r<br/>\nthere is only one winner and one loser. You either force them or let\r<br/>\nthem hurt themselves. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBut as far as either/or goes, unschoolers will answer that question as\r<br/>\n&quot;neither&quot; because our reality is entirely different. I will neither\r<br/>\nforce them nor will I &quot;let&quot; them kill themselves. What I will do is\r<br/>\nwork with them, in an attitude of mutual respect, to find a solution\r<br/>\nthat is acceptable to all. And because I treat my child with respect\r<br/>\nall the time - not just in this single instance - he will work with me\r<br/>\nto find that solution and not have to exert all his energy opposing\r<br/>\nme. We both win because we are not fighting each other, we are on the\r<br/>\nsame team working on a problem. It is just a completely different\r<br/>\nparadigm.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-Alice\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":280005589,"authorName":"Solé","from":"=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Sol=E9?= &lt;solelokuai@...&gt;","profile":"solelokua","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: &quot;impossible not to use coercive methods&quot;?","postDate":"1158767255","msgId":17485,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc5Q0Y4NjlGLTNDMEEtNDhDQS1CMzYyLUM1MjQxQzYzRDU5MEBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDJlMy5kNTM0Zjk5LjMyNDJiMThlQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDJlMy5kNTM0Zjk5LjMyNDJiMThlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17482,"nextInTopic":17493,"prevInTime":17484,"nextInTime":17486,"topicId":17297,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yeah, WOW, that s what I wanted to say too.

We *all* would like to believe that the <br/>\nchildhood we endured/survived was the best we could have had. Many <br/>\nthings often look blurry through adult eyes! &lt;g&gt; That&#39;s why people <br/>\ndon&#39;t make the necessary changes to be a better parent than their own <br/>\nparents were. I mean...THEY turned out OK, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n  AND I think that if it were a pro-unschooling study (meaning a <br/>\nsupporter of unschooling was doing the study) that it would be taken as <br/>\nself-serving publicity at most and plain stupid/reckless at the very <br/>\nleast. I think it would be rather hard to find a truly unbiased <br/>\ninterviewer/studier/sociologist/scientist.

If we were to do studies on<br/>\nunschoolers we would need a control group.  I don&#39;t see traditionally<br/>\nschooled children as a fair control group.  Would we compare them to<br/>\ntraditionally homeschooled children?  Children left in a box for 18<br/>\nyears?  What we can do is look at &quot;reports&quot; from parents of unschooled<br/>\nchildren.

Here to start with.  At<br/>\nsandradodd.com for another.  Several unschooling magazines and even<br/>\nunschooling blogs.  I think one reason that most unschoolers see their<br/>\nchildren as &quot;successful&quot; is because they have redefined what success<br/>\nis.  It isn&#39;t going to an Ivy league college, winning a Rhodes<br/>\nscholarship, becoming a well-paid defense attorney (or vascular<br/>\nsurgeon) *unless* those are the goals of that child.  I&#39;ve read<br/>\n&quot;reports&quot; from unshcooling moms who were just as proud of their<br/>\nchildren who chose to live homeless for a period of time as I have<br/>\nfrom unschooling moms whose children have gone on to more<br/>\ntraditionally looking careers.<br/>\n<br/>\nStudies schmudies.

Can I be with my children 100% of the time?  No.  I do<br/>\nhave to pee and bathe and go to work.  Yet I do know that if my child<br/>\nhas a need of me to be there for them I will.

I&#39;m so new to unschooling that I cannot answer all the  <br/>\nquestions or argue against waht she says, even though I jsut &quot;feel&quot;  <br/>\nthat unschooling is &quot;right&quot;. Don&#39;t tell me I should not go out there  <br/>\nto convince people, I&#39;m not, we&#39;re just discussing and soemtimes she  <br/>\nsays something and I feel, hmmmm yeah, hm, I really don&#39;t know, I  <br/>\nwonder waht unschoolers would do in these situations. So I have to  <br/>\nask you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo first, I said that unschoolers wouldn&#39;t restrict TV, and also not  <br/>\nthe kind of programs. I have asked here how come they don&#39;t even  <br/>\nrestrict the kind of programs, for there ARE programs which aren&#39;t  <br/>\ngood for children (pornos, horror, war etc, she brought up a  <br/>\nhitchcock movie she saw when she was 6 (the birds or soemthing) and  <br/>\nhow she was afraid of birds for her whole childhood and had  <br/>\nnightmares and so on), and got good answers that helped me understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said that unschoolers don&#39;t expect their children to even want to  <br/>\nwatch these kind of movies and they would prpbably trust the parents  <br/>\nif they told them as a friend that movie x was going to scare them,  <br/>\nbecause the child has ideally never been as disappointed by its  <br/>\nparents as schooled children who raised with coercive methods. And if  <br/>\nthey wanted to so badly we&#39;d talk about it and I&#39;d explain my worries  <br/>\nand if she still wanted to watch I&#39;d watch whith her etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, she said that NOW at 7 they wouldn&#39;t want to watch those things  <br/>\nbut in a few years... she said just like an adult would still be  <br/>\ncurious even if their husband/wife would tell them kindly not to  <br/>\nwatch something because X, they would probably still want to watch  <br/>\nit, accepting the consequences which a child couldn&#39;t forsee. An  <br/>\nadult could handle the consequences (fear, nightmares) better, but  <br/>\nchildren couldn&#39;t and she said there have been research where they  <br/>\nshowed children agressive movies and then someone would hit the  <br/>\nchild, and those children who watched agressive movies reacted way  <br/>\nmore agressive than the others who hadn&#39;t. So her point was, it is  <br/>\nproven to be damaging if they watch such things. And she doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nbelieve they wouldn&#39;t watch it just because their parents tell them –  <br/>\nand because I said that I would be watching with her if she wanted to  <br/>\nwatch something &quot;dangerous&quot;, she said that was quite time consuming  <br/>\nand if would I sit next to her each time at each hour in the day  <br/>\nwhenever she wants to watch something, would I be advising her each  <br/>\ntime if she should be watching X or Y? I guess I wouldn&#39;t want to,  <br/>\nand I cannot be 100% each minute with her. Is the only answer to this  <br/>\nthat unschooled children aren&#39;t interssed in TV so much anyway  <br/>\nbecause of all the strewing we do? *scratch.head*<br/>\n<br/>\nOk and then she came with other examples where she says it is  <br/>\nimpossible to not use any coercive methods and she quite got me  <br/>\nthere, I dunno what I would do especially with very young children  <br/>\nwhen you can&#39;t even explain so much. So one example was her son who  <br/>\nis 3, they were at the beach and he didn&#39;t want to neither use sun  <br/>\nblocking cream nor use a hat, and absolutely refused it no matter  <br/>\nwhat they explained (which they kindly did). Then they said they had  <br/>\nto go home – they went into the car, there he promised to use the  <br/>\nhat. He used it for 5 Minutes and again he refused to use it – same  <br/>\nprocedure, car, promise to use it, and then it worked for only THAT  <br/>\nday, and the other older child was pissed off because she did use the  <br/>\ncream but still was kind of punished (or would have been), if they  <br/>\nwould have had to go home. Then she told me they met a family with  <br/>\nthe same problem BUT, their son even had a sun allergy (or whatever  <br/>\nillness so he really couldn&#39;t be in the sun). So it didn&#39;t work out  <br/>\nvery well with the coercive method either, but with letting him with  <br/>\nno suncream it would have burned his skin. So she asks sarcastically,  <br/>\nwould I let my son &quot;burn&quot;, until he &quot;learns&quot;, what would the  <br/>\nunschooling parent do? and it&#39;s kind of mean to say, well then burn  <br/>\nfrom the sun, you&#39;ll see, isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nShe says they DO NOT learn from experience, for this thesis she had  <br/>\nanother example was that her son had hurt herself on his knee so he  <br/>\ngot a plaster. When the wound was healed, they tried to convince him  <br/>\nto put it off, but he refused. They explained it could inflame and  <br/>\nget worse and that it was really healed and so on but he refused. So  <br/>\nthey even let it there (&quot;unschooling&quot;) – and it did inflame and got  <br/>\nworse, it hurt him and everything, but he still didn&#39;t learn! the  <br/>\nnext time he had a plaster was the same drama, so what would the  <br/>\nunschooling parent do? if this is a safety issue I guess we would be  <br/>\n&quot;allowed&quot; to enforce it and just rip the plaster off, at least the  <br/>\nsecond time it happens? BUt then, wouldn&#39;t we be allowed to switch  <br/>\noff TV after the second scary movie, if the first one made her have  <br/>\nnightmares and she still didn&#39;t learn?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that I want to convince MY FRIEND, it&#39;s just that I really  <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how *I* would handle this and I have a son who is 1 now,  <br/>\nsoon those kind of issues will arise, I guess. My daughter is 7, with  <br/>\nher I can reason and since we are unschooling she is really  <br/>\nreasonable and she really trusts me what I say and we haven&#39;t had  <br/>\nthese kinds of arguments (I&#39;m waiting though, it&#39;s just been 3  <br/>\nweeks...), but with a toddler?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you<br/>\nJohanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17480,"nextTopicId":17449}}
