If I <br/>\nFORCED you to do what I say? Now??? For your own good??? Because *I* <br/>\nknow better???<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* believe that you are here because you are ready to learn more about <br/>\nunschooling. I figure you *want* to know more.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that you will *NOT* <br/>\nunderstand it completely until you are ready! All the little blocks <br/>\nHAVE to aligned &quot;just so&quot; before the light bulb will go off.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy being on this elist, you are surrounding yourself with an <br/>\n&quot;unschooling-rich world.&quot; You asked questions and examine the answers. <br/>\nYou attempt to put some strange words and actions together to make it <br/>\nwork in your family. You *play* with it and tweak it and even dismiss <br/>\nsome things as too difficult. You may come back to certain things that <br/>\nwere harder just a few months ago and toss those ideas around again. <br/>\nSome things click. Some things don&#39;t---but they may soon!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there is no way in bloody hell that you will start unschooling if I <br/>\nmake you. None. It has to be something you are 1) ready to do, and 2) <br/>\nwant to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with reading---and every-damn-thing else out there in the world. <br/>\nWithout internal motivation and a physical/mental readiness, it won&#39;t <br/>\nhappen.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t try to pass off here, on this list, that forcing a child to do <br/>\nwhat he&#39;s obviously NOT ready to do is acceptable and respectable. It <br/>\nis not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMore new features than ever.
