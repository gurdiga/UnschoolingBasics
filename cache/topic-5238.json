Here&#39;s one addy for a site at medicine net:<br/>\n <br/>\nwww.medicinenet.com/script/ main/art.asp?articlekey=43760<br/>\n <br/>\nIt sounds like the &#39;experts&#39; are saying there&#39;s no cause for concern. Then again, the person who asserted that untreated ADHD is &#39;devastating&#39; -- and implied that it could somehow be as bad as an increased cancer risk is one of those experts.  When did ADHD become as bad as cancer?  I mean, does ADHD actually kill people?  <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!

There&#39;s no question we need a bigger study before we can take any further major action.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoctors have been prescribing Ritalin for some 50 years, with schools advocating handing it out like candy to any kid how can&#39;t sit perfectly still for 7 hrs, and no one bothered to see if it altered chromosomes? <br/>\n<br/>\nFinal paragraph of the article:<br/>\n<br/>\nBut medical experts said that, until more is known, parents should not be overly frightened of giving the drug to their children.  &quot;Cancer is somethign to be scared about but untreated ADHD is devastating, too,&quot;  said Kathryn Ellerbeck, a developmental pediatrician at the University of Kanses Medical Center. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;End of quote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now untreated ADHD is at least as devastating and frightening as cancer?!   <br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDaniel MacIntyre &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:daniel.macintyre@...\">daniel.macintyre@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!
