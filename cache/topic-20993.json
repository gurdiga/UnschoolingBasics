I am still doing science shows <br/>\nin the<br/>\n  area, and having a blast, with shows, nature photography, walks on the <br/>\nbeach,<br/>\n and visiting with friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n This week&#39;s experiment comes from a teacher inservice on energy that I<br/>\n  presented at Florida Power and Light&#39;s Energy Encounter last week. We <br/>\nwere talking<br/>\n  about different ways that we measure energy, and as we talked about <br/>\nthe<br/>\n  energy stored in our food, they got quite a surprise. To see what <br/>\nstartled them,<br/>\n you will need:<br/>\n<br/>\n  1 M&M candy, or a small candy that tells you how many calories it <br/>\ncontains<br/>\n<br/>\n  In our food conscious world, we hear a lot about calories, but most <br/>\npeople<br/>\n  don&#39;t really know what a calorie is. Calories are a measure of energy. <br/>\nOne<br/>\n  calorie is the heat energy that it takes to raise the temperature of <br/>\none gram<br/>\n of water by one degree Celsius.<br/>\n<br/>\n There is some confusion, since in the food industry; the word Calorie<br/>\n  actually refers to a kilocalorie, which is one thousand actual <br/>\ncalories. The<br/>\n  nutritional Calorie is spelled with a capital &quot;C&quot;, while the actual <br/>\ncalorie has a<br/>\n lower case &quot;c&quot;. One nutritional Calorie has enough energy to raise the<br/>\n  temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. That means <br/>\nthat a piece<br/>\n  of candy that contains 200 nutritional Calories has enough chemical <br/>\nenergy<br/>\n  stored in it to raise the temperature of 200 kilograms (200 liters) of <br/>\nwater by<br/>\n one degree.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When you eat food, your body has two choices. It can use the Calories, <br/>\nor<br/>\n  it can store them for later. To maintain a steady body weight, we need <br/>\nto use<br/>\n  as many Calories as we consume. Depending on what you eat, and how <br/>\nmuch you<br/>\n  exercise that can be a challenge. To give you an idea of what it takes <br/>\nto<br/>\n use up the Calories, lets try an example.<br/>\n<br/>\n Pick up one M&M candy. Look at it carefully. Not very big, is it? And<br/>\n  it only contains 4.3 nutritional Calories. Not much at all, right? <br/>\nNow, eat<br/>\n the candy. So far, this is a really fun experiment.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, lets burn up the Calories from that tiny piece of candy. To do <br/>\nthat,<br/>\n  you have walk at a brisk pace for 100 yards, the length of a football <br/>\nfield.<br/>\n  No, just sitting there thinking about walking will not have the same <br/>\nresult.<br/>\n  Get up and actually walk. After walking that distance, you will have <br/>\nburned<br/>\n about the same amount of energy that was in the candy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, think about eating an entire bag of M&Ms. For each 18 pieces of <br/>\ncandy<br/>\n  that you eat, you would have to walk just over a mile, so even a small <br/>\nbag of<br/>\n candy would mean several miles of walking.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Look at some other foods, to see how far you would have to walk. You <br/>\nwill<br/>\n  be amazed at how much energy you consume. But wait a minute! If you <br/>\nlook at<br/>\n  guides to nutrition, most recommend a diet of about 10 Calories for <br/>\neach<br/>\n  pound of your weight each day. If you weigh 150 pounds, then a healthy <br/>\ndiet<br/>\n  should include about 1500 Calories. To walk that off, you would have <br/>\nto walk<br/>\n almost 20 miles a day! What is going on?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, not all the Calories you eat are used for exercise. Much that <br/>\nenergy<br/>\n  goes towards producing heat, to keep your body at a constant 98.6 <br/>\ndegrees.<br/>\n  It varies from person to person, but about 800 to 1000 of the calories <br/>\nthat the<br/>\n  average person eats will go towards producing the heat that maintains <br/>\nyour<br/>\n  body temperature. The rest of the Calories go towards keeping your <br/>\nbody<br/>\n running and letting you do the things that you do every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you eat more calories, then you need to exercise more, to keep your <br/>\nbody<br/>\n  from storing that energy as fat. That&#39;s why I spend so much time <br/>\nhiking with<br/>\n  30 pounds of camera equipment on my back. Besides the fun I have with <br/>\nnature<br/>\n  photography, it also helps me burn off all the ice cream, chocolate <br/>\nsauce,<br/>\n whipped cream, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n Have a wonder filled week!<br/>\n<br/>\n ****************************************<br/>\n  This weekly e-mail list is free from charge.   You are welcome to <br/>\nforward it<br/>\n  to friends, print it in your newsletter, repost it on the Internet, <br/>\netc., as<br/>\n long as you do not charge for them and my name and e-mail address are<br/>\n included. <br/>\n<br/>\n Please forward this e-mail to anyone that you think might enjoy it. <br/>\n<br/>\n To join the list, send a blank e-mail to:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:krampf-subscribe@...\">krampf-subscribe@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n on-line archives are located at: <br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/krampf/messages\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/krampf/messages</a><br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.topica.com/lists/krampf/read\">http://www.topica.com/lists/krampf/read</a><br/>\n<br/>\n ***************************<br/>\n Robert Krampf&#39;s on-the-road schedule:<br/>\n  My calendar is now on-line.  You can see a detailed calendar, with <br/>\ndates,<br/>\n times, schools, etc. at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.krampf.com/tour.html\">http://www.krampf.com/tour.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n ***************************<br/>\n<br/>\n Check out my web site at:<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.krampf.com\">http://www.krampf.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n From Robert Krampf&#39;s Science Education Company<br/>\n PO Box 60982<br/>\n Jacksonville, FL  32236-0982<br/>\n 904-388-6381<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.
