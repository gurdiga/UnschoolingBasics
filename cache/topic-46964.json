(Of course because I have these<br/>\ntendencies.)  Eating disordered attitudes -- are those thoughts and<br/>\nbehaviors which indicate an unhealthy attitude towards food, the body and<br/>\ntwo big screaming red flags of personal &quot;damage&quot; -- low self esteem and<br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nLow self-esteem seems self explanatory for this issue, &quot;hate yourself = hate<br/>\nyour body&quot; but control?  If you&#39;ve never had EDA or studied it, you might<br/>\nnot realize how important control is as an activating event.  If you can&#39;t<br/>\ncontrol anything else in your life, you can control what you put in your<br/>\nmouth, or what you keep in your body to metabolize.  This is very similar to<br/>\nstruggles parents have with toddlers on potty training.  They can&#39;t control<br/>\nanything else in their lives, but if you think you can make them poop on the<br/>\npotty...you&#39;ve got another thing coming.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is an interesting issue to me that women are willing to blame the media<br/>\nfor the unhealthy &quot;ideal&quot; woman or Barbie, or whatever else, but it&#39;s FAR<br/>\nless about that and much more about cognitive schema and control issues for<br/>\nmost women with EDA.  It may be helpful to show the girls the Dove company&#39;s<br/>\ncampaign for real beauty materials.

My boys are almost 15<br/>\nand almost 13 years old.  I do not delude myself.  At their age I was a<br/>\nraging ball of hormones.  (I did not have sex the first time until 2 weeks<br/>\nbefore my 18th birthday, ironically that was a Good Friday and I was an<br/>\nIrish Catholic at the time, and I was date raped.)  But I digress...I do not<br/>\npreach to my sons about abstinence.  I tell them &quot;Don&#39;t get anyone<br/>\npregnant.&quot;  I believe they will do what they will do for themselves when<br/>\nit&#39;s right for them.  (My 13 yr old&#39;s &quot;girlfriend&quot; lives in the UK so there<br/>\nis little that is going to happen there.)  But I don&#39;t believe they have the<br/>\n&quot;right&quot; to hurt others.  And teenage pregnancy is a tragedy for the BABY.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t &quot;care&quot; about anyone else involved frankly.  So, anyway, the &quot;advice&quot; I<br/>\nhope they take to heart is about the devastation to the infant.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, back to your daughters.  If you preach to them about this food or that<br/>\nbeing &quot;unhealthy&quot; you will lose that battle.  In point of fact you can find<br/>\nmany examples of people who &quot;eat healthy&quot; who are not healthy at all.  Lance<br/>\nArmstrong comes to mind though he may have brought about his cancer by<br/>\nsteroid usage.  I don&#39;t know.  I also know there are 100+ yr old men living<br/>\nin Afghanistan who do not &quot;eat healthy&quot; and yet are long lived.  So do watch<br/>\nwhat you say and what you demonstrate.   Anything you do that removes their<br/>\nsense of control over their lives, including restriction of food choice, ups<br/>\nthe risk of EDA or full blown ED.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome quick facts about eating disorders:<br/>\n<br/>\n*PREVALENCE*<br/>\n<br/>\n   - It is estimated that 8 million Americans have an eating disorder �<br/>\n   seven million women and one million men<br/>\n   - One in 200 American women suffers from anorexia<br/>\n   - Two to three in 100 American women suffers from bulimia<br/>\n   - Nearly half of all Americans personally know someone with an eating<br/>\n   disorder (Note: One in five Americans suffers from mental illnesses.)<br/>\n   - An estimated 10 � 15% of people with anorexia or bulimia are males<br/>\n<br/>\n *MORTALITY RATES *<br/>\n<br/>\n   - Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness<br/>\n   - A study by the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated<br/>\n   Disorders reported that 5 � 10% of anorexics die within 10 years after<br/>\n   contracting the disease; 18-20% of anorexics will be dead after 20 years and<br/>\n   only 30 � 40% ever fully recover<br/>\n   - *The mortality rate associated with anorexia nervosa is 12 times higher<br/>\n   than the death rate of ALL causes of death for females 15 � 24 years old.<br/>\n   *<br/>\n   - 20% of people suffering from anorexia will prematurely die from<br/>\n   complications related to their eating disorder, including suicide and heart<br/>\n   problems<br/>\n<br/>\n*ACCESS TO TREATMENT *<br/>\n<br/>\n   - Only 1 in 10 people with eating disorders receive treatment<br/>\n   - About 80% of the girls/women who have accessed care for their eating<br/>\n   disorders do not get the intensity of treatment they need to stay in<br/>\n   recovery � they are often sent home weeks earlier than the recommended stay<br/>\n   - Treatment of an eating disorder in the US ranges from $500 per day to<br/>\n   $2,000 per day. The average cost for a month of inpatient treatment is<br/>\n   $30,000. It is estimated that individuals with eating disorders need<br/>\n   anywhere from 3 � 6 months of inpatient care. Health insurance companies for<br/>\n   several reasons do not typically cover the cost of treating eating disorders<br/>\n<br/>\n   - The cost of outpatient treatment, including therapy and medical<br/>\n   monitoring, can extend to $100,000 or more<br/>\n<br/>\n*ADOLESCENTS*<br/>\n<br/>\n   - Anorexia is the 3rd most common chronic illness among adolescents<br/>\n   - 95% of those who have eating disorders are between the ages of 12 and<br/>\n   25<br/>\n   - 50% of girls between the ages of 11 and 13 see themselves as overweight<br/>\n<br/>\n   - 80% of 13-year-olds have attempted to lose weight<br/>\n<br/>\n*RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES*<br/>\n<br/>\n   - Rates of minorities with eating disorders are similar to those of white<br/>\n   women<br/>\n   - 74% of American Indian girls reported dieting and purging with diet<br/>\n   pills<br/>\n   - Essence magazine, in 1994, reported that 53.5% of their respondents,<br/>\n   African-American females were at risk of an eating disorder<br/>\n   - Eating disorders are one of the most common psychological problems<br/>\n   facing young women in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven these numbers, the average cost of treatment for an eating disorder is<br/>\nover $280K and it is statistically not likely to work.  When faced with<br/>\nthat...what would you rather have your daughters do -- drink soda or develop<br/>\nAN?<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to share some other thing here which I do not to frighten or punish<br/>\nanyone.  But I&#39;d like to let you into my head a little.  Let you know what<br/>\nit&#39;s like to live a life once these cognitive schema have taken root.  I did<br/>\nnot write this, but it could have been written by me.  I weigh myself 7<br/>\ntimes a day on a good day.  I have a scale which measures my weight to the<br/>\n.01 of a lb.  (And I don&#39;t get rid of the scale because I&#39;m working on NOT<br/>\nweighing to eliminate the drive. Not having access to it would be both going<br/>\n&quot;cold turkey&quot; and wouldn&#39;t allow me to change my maladaptive schema.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe site on which this appears proclaims that AN is a lifestyle, not a<br/>\ndisease and enjoins the reader to &quot;suck it in harder&quot;... both sad and<br/>\nterrifying.  And I live this each day, the fight between these thoughts and<br/>\nwhat I know to be a more healthy way to live.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nANA Creed<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe in Control, the only force mighty enough to bring order to the<br/>\nchaos that is my world.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that I am the most vile, worthless and useless person ever to have<br/>\nexisted on this planet, and that I am totally unworthy of anyone&#39;s time and<br/>\nattention.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that other people who tell me differently must be idiots. If they<br/>\ncould see how I really am, then they would hate me almost as much as I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe in oughts, musts and shoulds as unbreakable laws to determine my<br/>\ndaily behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe in perfection and strive to attain it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe in salvation through trying just a bit harder than I did<br/>\nyesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe in calorie counters as the inspired word of g_d, and memorize them<br/>\naccordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe in bathroom scales as an indicator of my daily successes and<br/>\nfailures<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe in hell, because I sometimes think that I&#39;m living in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe in a wholly black and white world, the losing of weight,<br/>\nrecrimination for sins, the abnegation of the body and a life ever fasting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this:<br/>\n<br/>\nAna Psalm<br/>\n<br/>\nStrict is my diet.
