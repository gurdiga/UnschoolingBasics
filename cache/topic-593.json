LONG<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi there,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Should the child not be able to do what she wants because of the parent&#39;s<br/>\n  wishes?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think the reality is that sometimes someone has to do something they don&#39;t want to, or miss out on something they want, simply because there are other people in the family.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The goal isn&#39;t one person getting their way at the expense of the other. The<br/>\n  goal is trying to find a solution that works for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I agree, but sometimes it just doesn&#39;t happen that way. Can you say that you are able to accomodate every person in your family on every given day?<br/>\n<br/>\n  If a child is confident that the parent is working to help her get what she<br/>\n  wants, it won&#39;t feel like she&#39;s losing the battle if there are times when<br/>\n  it&#39;s more convenient for one person to have to give up what they want so<br/>\n  another person can get what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I agree with this, I think we just go about it in different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know it seems like we&#39;re always giving them what they want, but that<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t count! ;-) For instance, if a friend is always giving up her<br/>\n  peaceful Saturday afternoons without saying a word about it to help us do<br/>\n  some charity work, we&#39;re going to assume the friend is helping because she<br/>\n  wants to, not because she&#39;s making sacrifices to give us what we want.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The &quot;friend&quot; being an adult has the responsibility to say what they are feeling and to not do things that they aren&#39;t wanting to do especially if they are feeling like they are *sacrificing*. It isn&#39;t the job of the other person to guess what they are feeling. So if I put off my things to do something of hers, I let her know. I say &quot;well I can see you really want to go to the park, so I can put off these errands till tomorrow, so lets go&quot;. But if I am 5 minutes away from a client coming then there is no way I can do it. Not everything can be put off for a trip to the park.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So when we &quot;give in&quot; to them, children assume we&#39;re doing what we want.<br/>\n<br/>\n  They do if we don&#39;t communicate with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s those times when our wants and needs clash and kids see us willingly<br/>\n  making it a high priority to work out a way for us both to get our needs met<br/>\n  that gains kids&#39; confidence that what the kids want is just as important to<br/>\n  us as what we want.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I agree. That doesn&#39;t mean the kids get to do everything they want to at the expense of everyone else. Or that the adults get to do everything they want at the expense of the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The way to encourage children to give is by giving not by taking from them!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Again, I agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If we set up the situation between us where one side needs to lose for the<br/>\n  other to win, kids will treat it as a battle. About the only tool they have<br/>\n  is to dig in their heels and hold onto the territory they have, even when<br/>\n  it&#39;s not territory that they feel strongly about. They know they often lose<br/>\n  because they&#39;re weaker and parents can just take whatever they want, so they<br/>\n  need to hold onto any territory they possibly can. So if they&#39;re asked to<br/>\n  give up an afternoon so mom and dad can shop, they&#39;ll draw the line and<br/>\n  refuse. Which leaves us the only option of making them go.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Why do you assume it is a win/lose situation in my home? I try to make it win/win for all of us. I spent a half an hour in the rain at an outdoor Barney concert today for goodness sake, that sure wasn&#39;t because I wanted to be there or didn&#39;t have 50 other things I could be doing. But it went on the calendar weeks ago as a commitment we made to do today, after our midwives appointment. So we all got things done. Win/win. No one complained or sacrificed more than the other.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It helps to see what the world looks like from a child&#39;s point of view so we<br/>\n  can get to a mental place where we don&#39;t resent helping a child who has so<br/>\n  little power in the world. We brought them into the world. And part of the<br/>\n  package deal is that we give up a lot of what we have to help them get what<br/>\n  they want. If you were dragged around here and there to boring places for<br/>\n  hours at a time just because your husband wanted to go and he was bigger and<br/>\n  stronger and could make you, it would be a big factor eating away at your<br/>\n  relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Give up a lot yes, not everything. I seek balance. I do not drag my child around to boring places for hours at a time just because I want to go there and I am bigger and can make her. I really resent that implication to be honest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  And isnt&#39; the child learning that they&#39;re second class citizens whenever<br/>\n  their needs conflict with the parents needs and the parents decide they<br/>\n  don&#39;t want to inconvenience themselves to help everyone get what they want?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Depending on how it is handled. Seems to be a lot of assumptions going on to be honest. They do not have to learn they are second class citizens, to do things that other want. They also do not have to learn that the world revolves around them and they get to do only what they want to. Again, when we have conflicting needs, the parents don&#39;t always get what they want and don&#39;t always decide by inconvenience to them. I am sure you have met people like that, but nothing I said in my post indicated that I was that kind of parent. So why are you assuming it? If I don&#39;t do it your way then I must be neglecting my child&#39;s needs and dragging them around without a thought to their needs? Hogwash. There is a happy medium.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s only compromise when everyone has equal power and equal say. Usually<br/>\n  when parents talk about &quot;compromise&quot; it means kids get their way when it&#39;s<br/>\n  convenient for parents and parents get their way when it&#39;s not.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t agree with your definition of compromise. Often there are compromises when there is very unequal power and say. And sometimes there are exceptions to the rule.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for your thoughts,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sherri-Lee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

The<br/>\ngoal is trying to find a solution that works for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree, but sometimes it just doesn&#39;t happen that way. Can you say that you are able to accomodate every person in your family on every given day?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child is confident that the parent is working to help her get what she<br/>\nwants, it won&#39;t feel like she&#39;s losing the battle if there are times when<br/>\nit&#39;s more convenient for one person to have to give up what they want so<br/>\nanother person can get what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with this, I think we just go about it in different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it seems like we&#39;re always giving them what they want, but that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t count! ;-) For instance, if a friend is always giving up her<br/>\npeaceful Saturday afternoons without saying a word about it to help us do<br/>\nsome charity work, we&#39;re going to assume the friend is helping because she<br/>\nwants to, not because she&#39;s making sacrifices to give us what we want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;friend&quot; being an adult has the responsibility to say what they are feeling and to not do things that they aren&#39;t wanting to do especially if they are feeling like they are *sacrificing*. It isn&#39;t the job of the other person to guess what they are feeling. So if I put off my things to do something of hers, I let her know. I say &quot;well I can see you really want to go to the park, so I can put off these errands till tomorrow, so lets go&quot;. But if I am 5 minutes away from a client coming then there is no way I can do it. Not everything can be put off for a trip to the park.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when we &quot;give in&quot; to them, children assume we&#39;re doing what we want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey do if we don&#39;t communicate with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s those times when our wants and needs clash and kids see us willingly<br/>\nmaking it a high priority to work out a way for us both to get our needs met<br/>\nthat gains kids&#39; confidence that what the kids want is just as important to<br/>\nus as what we want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree. That doesn&#39;t mean the kids get to do everything they want to at the expense of everyone else. Or that the adults get to do everything they want at the expense of the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to encourage children to give is by giving not by taking from them!<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I agree.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we set up the situation between us where one side needs to lose for the<br/>\nother to win, kids will treat it as a battle. About the only tool they have<br/>\nis to dig in their heels and hold onto the territory they have, even when<br/>\nit&#39;s not territory that they feel strongly about. They know they often lose<br/>\nbecause they&#39;re weaker and parents can just take whatever they want, so they<br/>\nneed to hold onto any territory they possibly can. So if they&#39;re asked to<br/>\ngive up an afternoon so mom and dad can shop, they&#39;ll draw the line and<br/>\nrefuse. Which leaves us the only option of making them go.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you assume it is a win/lose situation in my home? I try to make it win/win for all of us. I spent a half an hour in the rain at an outdoor Barney concert today for goodness sake, that sure wasn&#39;t because I wanted to be there or didn&#39;t have 50 other things I could be doing. But it went on the calendar weeks ago as a commitment we made to do today, after our midwives appointment. So we all got things done. Win/win. No one complained or sacrificed more than the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to see what the world looks like from a child&#39;s point of view so we<br/>\ncan get to a mental place where we don&#39;t resent helping a child who has so<br/>\nlittle power in the world. We brought them into the world. And part of the<br/>\npackage deal is that we give up a lot of what we have to help them get what<br/>\nthey want. If you were dragged around here and there to boring places for<br/>\nhours at a time just because your husband wanted to go and he was bigger and<br/>\nstronger and could make you, it would be a big factor eating away at your<br/>\nrelationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive up a lot yes, not everything. I seek balance. I do not drag my child around to boring places for hours at a time just because I want to go there and I am bigger and can make her. I really resent that implication to be honest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd isnt&#39; the child learning that they&#39;re second class citizens whenever<br/>\ntheir needs conflict with the parents needs and the parents decide they<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to inconvenience themselves to help everyone get what they want?<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on how it is handled. Seems to be a lot of assumptions going on to be honest. They do not have to learn they are second class citizens, to do things that other want. They also do not have to learn that the world revolves around them and they get to do only what they want to. Again, when we have conflicting needs, the parents don&#39;t always get what they want and don&#39;t always decide by inconvenience to them. I am sure you have met people like that, but nothing I said in my post indicated that I was that kind of parent. So why are you assuming it? If I don&#39;t do it your way then I must be neglecting my child&#39;s needs and dragging them around without a thought to their needs? Hogwash. There is a happy medium.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s only compromise when everyone has equal power and equal say. Usually<br/>\nwhen parents talk about &quot;compromise&quot; it means kids get their way when it&#39;s<br/>\nconvenient for parents and parents get their way when it&#39;s not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t agree with your definition of compromise. Often there are compromises when there is very unequal power and say. And sometimes there are exceptions to the rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your thoughts,<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86288922,"authorName":"Sherri-Lee Pressman","from":"Sherri-Lee Pressman &lt;s-lp@...&gt;","profile":"sherrileepr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] intro.

So to some extent, I am the one in charge for the day. I have no interest in living in a situation where everything is done by committee. In  my experience (in other situations) little to nothing gets done in that situation. In our home, we all have things we need to do in the day. On the weekends, when we spend the day with dh, then we all list what we have to do (at 4 my dd has little she *has* to do each day other than class commitments (not on the weekend) and eating, and playing.) We then look at what *needs* to be done and what we want to do and try to fit it all in. If we make a plan and it becomes apparent that my dd has no patience for anymore running around then we go home and have a better time than if we stayed out. Perhaps one of us goes out to finish the errands or perhaps they get put off if they can to the next day.

The<br/>\ngoal is trying to find a solution that works for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child is confident that the parent is working to help her get what she<br/>\nwants, it won&#39;t feel like she&#39;s losing the battle if there are times when<br/>\nit&#39;s more convenient for one person to have to give up what they want so<br/>\nanother person can get what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it seems like we&#39;re always giving them what they want, but that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t count! ;-) For instance, if a friend is always giving up her<br/>\npeaceful Saturday afternoons without saying a word about it to help us do<br/>\nsome charity work, we&#39;re going to assume the friend is helping because she<br/>\nwants to, not because she&#39;s making sacrifices to give us what we want.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when we &quot;give in&quot; to them, children assume we&#39;re doing what we want.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s those times when our wants and needs clash and kids see us willingly<br/>\nmaking it a high priority to work out a way for us both to get our needs met<br/>\nthat gains kids&#39; confidence that what the kids want is just as important to<br/>\nus as what we want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to encourage children to give is by giving not by taking from them!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we set up the situation between us where one side needs to lose for the<br/>\nother to win, kids will treat it as a battle. About the only tool they have<br/>\nis to dig in their heels and hold onto the territory they have, even when<br/>\nit&#39;s not territory that they feel strongly about. They know they often lose<br/>\nbecause they&#39;re weaker and parents can just take whatever they want, so they<br/>\nneed to hold onto any territory they possibly can.

The things it<br/>\nmakes sense to me that I need to ask my kids about and that they need to ask<br/>\nme about is plans and decisions we make that involve participation from each<br/>\nother.

Then she would<br/>\nneed to &quot;ask&quot; me not about the content, but about how I feel about making<br/>\nit, since I am the one doing the making and I may feel for example &quot;Gosh,<br/>\nit&#39;s so hot today, I just don&#39;t feel I can turn on the oven for that&quot; or<br/>\nalternately &quot;Well, I just cooked for you guys 15 minutes ago and I don&#39;t<br/>\nreally feel like cooking again.&quot;  Then I would ask &quot;Can you make do with<br/>\nsomething I don&#39;t have to cook?&quot; or something similar and we would have a<br/>\ndiscussion about it considering everyone&#39;s needs and hopefully coming up<br/>\nwith a solution that everyone feels good about.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny plans I make for our day together that don&#39;t require my kids<br/>\nparticipation, I don&#39;t feel I need to &quot;ask&quot; them about.  I would definitely<br/>\nhowever notify them ahead of time about plans where we split up so they know<br/>\nwhat to expect and I am always open to talking about their feelings about<br/>\nbeing away from me.  If the plans I am pondering require my children&#39;s<br/>\nparticipation, then it makes sense to me that I would honor their feelings<br/>\nas participants and &quot;ask&quot; them how they feel about partipating (just like<br/>\nthey would ask me about cooking for them).  That does not mean that my<br/>\nfeelings are not important or not as important as theirs.  It&#39;s not about<br/>\nmeasuring feelings for me.  It does mean that since we would all be doing it<br/>\ntogether, all our feelings are important, and thus it is important for us<br/>\nall to talk, to put on our &quot;thinking hats&quot; as I like to say (at one point my<br/>\ndaughter and I made physical &quot;thinking hats&quot; together we used to put on).  I<br/>\nwould start to spell out &quot;Well, Mom needs this, Dad needs this, Aline needs<br/>\nthis, Nicky needs this.  How can we get all our needs met?&quot;  We brainstorm<br/>\nand problem solve and I take their suggestions seriously, whatever they may<br/>\nhappen to be.  This method has had many benefits for us.  I have found that<br/>\nit has turned my children into little problem solvers and also allowed them<br/>\nto come up with ideas that help us find solutions I might have gotten too<br/>\nfrustrated to get to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example would be: Today I had promised my brother in law that we would<br/>\ncome over to his house.  My sister was out of town and he wanted to work on<br/>\nhis pool.  He asked me if my dh and I would help with his kids (ages 4 yrs<br/>\nand 10 months) while he did this and I said sure.  He also was looking for<br/>\nhelp at certain points on the pool from dh.  The last time we went, my kids<br/>\nwere happy enough to go to their cousins house.  Today turned out to be a<br/>\nproblem.  My daughter (who is a huge homebody anyway and a big challenge to<br/>\nget out of the house most days) didn&#39;t get enough sleep, and also was<br/>\nincredibly grumpy when some modelling crafts we had made that she wanted to<br/>\npaint that were not dry enough.  She didn&#39;t want to go with us, she wanted<br/>\nto stay home and wait for them to dry.  I had made a promise to my BIL.  So<br/>\nwe talked about it.  I told her that I could see her disappointment over the<br/>\ncrafts (and explained why I thought we had estimated wrong on the drying<br/>\ntime) and I understood how she really wanted to paint them.  I also<br/>\nexplained that Mama had made this promise with her uncle.  What could we do?<br/>\nShe suggested bringing her cousins to our house instead and just daddy goes<br/>\nto her uncle&#39;s (very ingenious!)  I said that was a good idea, but what I<br/>\nwas concerned about was that her 10 month old cousin hasn&#39;t spent a lot of<br/>\ntime with us and might need her daddy at some point and it would be a half<br/>\nhour drive to get her to him if she got really upset.  And I pointed out<br/>\nthat all of them would have to come with me.  I said &quot;how about if your<br/>\nolder cousin comes here, you can stay home with Daddy and her, I will go<br/>\nwatch the 10 month old at your uncle&#39;s house and try to juggle her to help<br/>\nwith the pool if needed (throw her in a backpack carrier perhaps).  She was<br/>\nintrigued by this idea but also doesn&#39;t like to be away from me all<br/>\nafternoon.  She decided to think about it for a while until my dh came back<br/>\nfrom his morning run and it would be closer to time to go.  Shortly after my<br/>\ndh came back she remembered that she was wanting to paint a wooden bug box<br/>\nfrom the craft store that we saw on our last visit.  She really wanted to go<br/>\nto the craft store, get it and paint it (in lieu of the undried items).  So<br/>\nI countered with a plan:  We would go to the craft store, get the bug<br/>\ncatcher, plus something for her brother and older cousin to paint (she could<br/>\nhelp me pick it out).  We would bring all our painting materials with us and<br/>\nshe could paint her bug catcher together with brother and cousin at her<br/>\ncousin&#39;s house.  &quot;Yes!&quot; she cried, and we&#39;d found a solution that worked for<br/>\neveryone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first started doing this sort of thing, I found it really hard to<br/>\ngather the time and patience to negotiate, problem solve, wait some more,<br/>\nfocus on listening to my kids instead of my own internal frustration.  But<br/>\nas we did it more and more, it got easier and easier.  And in my book it way<br/>\nbeats trying to impose my will on them to go regardless of how they feel<br/>\nabout it.  Not only because that makes for frustration and hurt feelings all<br/>\naround, but because I feel that the biggest thing I am in my children&#39;s life<br/>\nis an example.  If my example is &quot;I get to impose my will on you regardless<br/>\nof how I feel because I want to&quot;, then that is how they learn to problem<br/>\nsolve.  If my example is &quot;Let&#39;s problem solve by taking everyone&#39;s needs<br/>\ninto account and figuring out the best scenario&quot;, then they learn to do that<br/>\nwhich not only helps them in the family, but helps them negotiate life.  My<br/>\nbottom line: I had made a promise to my BIL, but I also would have been open<br/>\nto calling my BIL and asking him if we could re-schedule if it came down to<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are not hearing they are in charge.  They are hearing that we<br/>\nare all in it together, that we all have different needs and feelings, and<br/>\nthey are learning how to figure it out together.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that makes some sense to you in the place where you are at...<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan<br/>\nMom to Aline 5.7 and Nicky 3.4</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86288922,"authorName":"Sherri-Lee Pressman","from":"Sherri-Lee Pressman &lt;s-lp@...&gt;","profile":"sherrileepr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] intro.

One thing I wanted to say, is that you can be an unschooler and still enforce bedtimes, food controls","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-687049813\">Hi Ren,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the reply,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Sherri-Lee and welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\n  One thing I wanted to say, is that you can be an unschooler and <br/>\n  still enforce bedtimes, food controls etc.... It&#39;s not about <br/>\n  saying &quot;you aren&#39;t an unschooler if you don&#39;t let your kids eat <br/>\n  sugar&quot;. What I HAVE found to be true, is that unschooling unfolds <br/>\n  best in an atmosphere of complete trust and respect. And controlling <br/>\n  another human beings choices is just not truly <br/>\n  respectful....although I think your children won&#39;t grow up to feel <br/>\n  anything but loved and cherished if you continue as you are at the <br/>\n  present moment.<br/>\n  The thing about unschooling, is once we begin to see that our <br/>\n  children can make choices about what/when to learn, we MUST question <br/>\n  all the other controls that are taken for granted. You&#39;ve already <br/>\n  started questioning a lot of issues, so I&#39;m sure you can see how <br/>\n  that unschooling mindset begins to affect your entire life and make <br/>\n  you question everything about parenting!<br/>\n  I can see that and thank you for stating that. On so many other lists I am on, whether it is about unschooling or not, there is often the attitude, that if you don&#39;t do it all then you don&#39;t &quot;qualify&quot; for the title. Luckily, I long ago let go of my need for anyone else to see me the way I do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you think about it from an adult point of view, what if you lived <br/>\n  with family that would not let you eat a vegetarian diet (if you <br/>\n  wanted to) or kept other foods from you that THEY deemed &quot;bad&quot;.<br/>\n  The only thing it really affects is the relationship between the <br/>\n  controller and the controllee. It doesn&#39;t make you want the food <br/>\n  item any less.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is a good perspective and I hadn&#39;t thought of it this way. I am a partial vegy, meaning I eat chicken, turkey and fish, but no red meat. My dh is a carnivore. He always has salami in the house. I personally hate it, but when my dd said she wanted to try it I didn&#39;t stand in her way and now her and daddy enjoy sharing their afternoon snack of salami (ICK!). For us, it isn&#39;t a matter of &quot;not letting&quot; her have any of the foods she is interested in, but limiting how much and working with her to teach her about the value of those foods. A perfect example is McD&#39;s. she does not know what this place is and she will not learn from us. Other kids ask for it or recognise the arches and when they say something my dd thinks they are talking about the farmer!:) I love that. We don&#39;t eat it, so I am sure not going to take her to it to introduce it to her just so she can have the opportunity to self regulate herself about intake.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I really, really believe that sugar or other &quot;junk&quot; substances are <br/>\n  much healthier for a person than having another human being control <br/>\n  them. I think guilty feelings associated with food are much more <br/>\n  harmful than sugar. And this is coming from a certified health-<br/>\n  freak, so I feel I have a right to defend children&#39;s choices on this <br/>\n  subject.:)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I really really believe that I am educating my daughter about things not controlling her the way it is presented here. I see the damage that sugar does to people&#39;s lives daily in my business and although I do not want to end up encouraging her to binge when she is away from us, I want her to know WHY we limit that kind of food. It is not arbitrary. The other day she asked for a fruit bar, I said, we are just about to go for lunch, do you want to eat your lunch first and save the bar for after or the bar first and eat lunch later. She picked having lunch first and never did get around to the bar. I didn&#39;t control her then. But she made the choice because of the talking and education we have offered her.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t eat ANY sugar right now. Not honey, not fruit, not any sugar <br/>\n  of any kind. I can&#39;t eat carbs, I eat mostly protein and <br/>\n  vegetables...it&#39;s HARD. So should my restrictive diet be forced upon <br/>\n  others? I&#39;ve been semi-vegetarian for 10 years, should my children <br/>\n  not be allowed to eat meat because I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s not healthy?<br/>\n<br/>\n  That kind of a diet is hard. I assume it is for health reasons. The only reason why others would eat this way would be because they had the same health concerns (or you did for them) or because they chose to to support you. When I was on my food elimination diet to recover from FM and CFS my bf at the time totally changed his diet to be the same as mine in support of me. It made it so much easier to stick with it and I cared for him more for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Every human being should be able to choose the diet that they feel <br/>\n  comfortable with. Our children will choose, regardless of whether we <br/>\n  control their choices or not (it&#39;s called sneaking). I&#39;d rather have <br/>\n  the kind of relationship that allows for free exploration and <br/>\n  dialogue, rather than my children feeling they need to hide their <br/>\n  Snickers bar from me. yk?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Me too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean the parents don&#39;t suggest things, or offer <br/>\n  or just DO things that sound fun. It&#39;s simply honoring their choices <br/>\n  if those choices are different than our own, or they want something <br/>\n  different than what we offer.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I like this idea in theory. Still not convinced it can be totally achieved for us at least. This is something else that comes up for me reading the various threads is the respect issue. Respecting the child is important of course but at the cost of what? Lets say the parents want to go do something on the weekend, shop for materials for a home project they are working on (currently going on in my home) and the child does not want to go out. Should the parents not be able to go do what they want to because of the child&#39;s wishes? How do you manage to respect everyone&#39;s wishes when they are so completely opposite? It feels like sometimes respecting the child happens at the expense of the parent and although I think the parent can do this as the adult and be ok with it sometimes, resentment comes when you give up of yourself too much to meet others needs. And isn&#39;t the child learning that the world revolves around them and that they make the plans for everyone in the house? What about compromise and working together? Am I making sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I try to equate it to living with a roommate (though that&#39;s not <br/>\n  necessarily a good analogy, because we obviously have a totally <br/>\n  different relationship with our children) and how I would treat <br/>\n  them. A roommate my have a very different diet than my own, totally <br/>\n  different tv viewing habits and a far different level of comfort <br/>\n  with cleanliness. I wouldn&#39;t force myself upon another adult (unless <br/>\n  they were disregarding my personal boundaries) or try to control <br/>\n  their choices....so I won&#39;t do that with my children either.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I really don&#39;t agree with this. I don&#39;t live with roommates, I live with my family. I have had both and it is totally different living with a family than a roommate. I was not the least bit bothered if my room mate ate Mc&#39;D every day and stayed out all night and slept most of the day. As long as they had the rent and kept things tidy and didn&#39;t put their moods on me fine. But I also had no obligation to them either.. I do to my family. It is a totally different thing in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Enjoy the unschooling journey!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks, so far life is more peaceful around here. Once I started asking myself &quot;why am I saying no&quot; and stopped saying no to the trivial things and gave up the need to decide on those things, she doesn&#39;t resist the really big things I have to say no on as much. Less fighting, less complaining, less whining... all is good so far. And more peace in me, less judgment of my decisions, less feeling like I am lacking and more acceptance of what is... also all good.<br/>\n  Thanks for the welcome,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sherri-Lee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"intro.

I also enjoy getting some cleaning or <br/>\nart/writing done when they are happily absorbed in a <br/>\nprogram....that&#39;s a great way to meet everyone&#39;s needs!
