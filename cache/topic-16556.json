Starting when school starts in your area. Maybe even <br/>\nplan a special event with the kids - lunch out at a favorite place or <br/>\na picnic at the beach or whatever to &#39;kick things off&#39; - the start of <br/>\na long vacation. General rule of thumb for deschooling (which everyone <br/>\nneeds, not just the kids) is one month for every year of school. Which <br/>\nmean the grown ups need at least a year to slowly unwind the tapes <br/>\nthat say &quot;but you should be doing this&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re supposed to know <br/>\nthat&quot; and so on. So, wait until somewhere around spring cleaning time, <br/>\nat the earliest to see the buds of curiousity start blooming in your <br/>\nkids. The time from now to then might feel a bit nervous to you, keep <br/>\nin mind you need more time than they do even. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you feel like you&#39;re still &#39;new&#39; to your area, great! Go to the <br/>\nlocal chamber of commerce or the town/state website and find out all <br/>\nthe stuff they commend to tourists...then go do it. Lots of free stuff <br/>\nusually (they don&#39;t want tourists to think it&#39;s really expensive to <br/>\nvacation there) - state parks, music concerts for free on the town <br/>\ngreen, festivals and carnivals and parades and such. And deliberately <br/>\nstash aside x amount per week (or pay period) so that when stuff that <br/>\ndoes cost cash comes up (a state fair, a renaissance faire, a movie at <br/>\nthe drive in, etc) you&#39;ll have it available without killing the <br/>\nbudget. Be a tourist in your own town. Even just going to the &quot;other&quot; <br/>\nside of town and checking out the ethnic markets can be a fun time.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":58929735,"authorName":"psychomom95","from":"&quot;psychomom95&quot; &lt;psychomom95@...&gt;","profile":"psychomom95","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"I am new to this","postDate":"1155907931","msgId":16556,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVjNGZncitnM21nQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16561,"prevInTime":16555,"nextInTime":16557,"topicId":16556,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, my name is Vanessa.

(hubby wanted them to finish the year.)  We <br/>\nwill begin our journey of unschooling this year, and would love any <br/>\nsuggestion/help anyone can offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were too many bullying problems, which none were getting taken <br/>\ncare of, and my kids didn&#39;t feel safe, and were not happy in the <br/>\npublic schools.  Things have changed alot, since I was in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two kids-Tyler will be 11 in October, and has taken the brunt <br/>\nof bullying (even though the school says there is none aloud-lol), <br/>\nand I also have a daughter Alexandra who is 9.  She also has been <br/>\nbullied, but not as bad as my son.  I am hoping to get them out of <br/>\nthe groove of public schools, and have them feel more relaxed, and <br/>\nready to have some fun learning new things with me. I feel like they <br/>\nhave lost their love for learning, and their excitement too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have researched different types of homeschooling, and have found <br/>\nthat unschooling fits our lifestyle more.  I don&#39;t want the kids to <br/>\nsit at the kitchen table for 3 hours a day, and do nothing but crack <br/>\nopen books.  They did that enough in public schools, but for a lot <br/>\nlonger.  We live in South Lyon, and have been here for about 5 <br/>\nyears.  So I am still kind of new to this area.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking for fun/but cheap/free things to do with my kids, since <br/>\nmoney is tight, and we are a single income family.  I haven&#39;t had a <br/>\nchance to read any books about unschooling all the way through, but <br/>\nhave read some chapters of a couple of books.  Any help anyone could <br/>\ngive me would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, and have a great weekend.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16506,"nextTopicId":16577}}
