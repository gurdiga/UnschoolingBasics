By what <br/>\nI mean are you concerned with the physical mechanics of putting <br/>\nimplement to paper or are you concerned with the creative aspect of <br/>\nstringing together words to communicate ideas? Why exactly is writing <br/>\nmore at age 8 important to you? (as opposed to say 7 or 9 or 12) I&#39;ve <br/>\ngot an 8 1/2 year old who has stories and game ideas and all sorts of <br/>\nstuff bubbling in his brain all the time. But, unless he wants it <br/>\nwritten down, it just is verbal communication (very clear and <br/>\ndescriptive and imaginative verbal communication too). Sometimes he <br/>\nasks me to take dictation if he wants to keep an idea. So I do. If the <br/>\nstory telling communicating side is what you are wanting, maybe ask if <br/>\nyou can write it down when your DD starts describing or telling a <br/>\nstory or whatever. Otherwise, work on your own insides first - why <br/>\nthis is so important to you for her right now at age 8. Maybe even do <br/>\nsome writing on your own (if it&#39;s that important, I&#39;m guessing you <br/>\nwrite creatively, journal, whatever, in your own life on a regular <br/>\nbasis - if not, why is it critical for her life at 8 yrs old but not <br/>\nyours)<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231930081,"authorName":"wibberbie","from":"&quot;wibberbie&quot; &lt;dj250@...&gt;","profile":"wibberbie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"My response (WAS:  I&#39;ve Lost It)","postDate":"1173977424","msgId":22258,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV0YnRnZyt0ZG9nQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22262,"prevInTime":22257,"nextInTime":22259,"topicId":22258,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ok, I m feelin pretty crummy right now.
