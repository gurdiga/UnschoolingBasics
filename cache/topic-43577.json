This is from when Linnaea was 5 or 6 and My Humps had come out. My dad was visiting and Linnaea was finding all the magical things she had, all the bits of treasure that she filled her life with and sharing them. So she and my dad danced together on dance mats to a Mario game for the gamecube and she showed him her dogs on nintendogs and she showed him walks we took and she brought him flowers. It was this showering of love and wanting him to love her back. Among her treasures was the video My Humps on the computer. David and I and other friends of ours had thought it was such a funny video, it was good musically and there was, in my interpretation, a tongue in cheek nature to the described crassness of the relationship between men and women. My dad was appalled. He took me aside and questioned how we could allow my daughter access to such misogynist videos. I was livid and decided it was a<br/>\n good time to take the dog for a walk. And I thought about it, and I saw all that she had done, all the jewels she&#39;d polished and made dazzle to show to him. And I was hurt for her because of his inability to trust her enjoyment of something not taking away from her love of herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nLinnaea is not now, nor has she ever been, a wallflower. She is bold and brassy and absolutely able to speak of her needs and her self. Over the few days that he&#39;d already been with us she&#39;d been involved with conversations where she&#39;d spoken up about women not tolerating men&#39;s dominance. In fearing for her safety, her fragile sense of self, my father had missed the greater picture of who Linnaea was, of who Linnaea is. Linnaea&#39;s life is full of things that support her feeling good about herself. And she does. She likes herself and is more comfortable with herself than most women I know and she&#39;s 10. When she was 5 or 6, the fear of a song about breasts and butts being used to get jewels and clothes, well, I don&#39;t think that was the way she heard that song. She saw it as a fun song to dance with and she wanted to dance with her grandpa. And of course there is the irony in my dad&#39;s love of A Chorus Line, and the song Tits and Ass (Dance Ten Looks Three)<br/>\n which he never commented on as I sang along to the record in the tv room. Same message, same cynicism. <br/>\n<br/>\nLinnaea is buffered not by my censorship, not by my controlling what she hears or sees or conceptualises, but by her loving and supportive and nurturing environment. All of the things I could limit and control exist and can be found if I am inattentive in my vigilance even for a moment and then they become things to hide and to feel guilty about. But if I am there with her, if I am watching South Park with her and talking about why that line makes me squeamish and still makes me laugh or if I&#39;m there laughing over My Humps or if I&#39;m supportive of whatever, well then it is an open exchange of ideas and opinions and taste. And she gets to share with me and trust me to trust her and her strength and her love of her self. It isn&#39;t so scary a world if you are invited to come along. But if you shut the gate to their experience, no one is gonna invite you to come as they leap the fence when you aren&#39;t looking. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nListen to me!

I do cuss a lot though, a WHOLE lot.  I cuss around my 10 y/o<br/>\nson, and more recently have told him that he&#39;s allowed to cuss.  He still<br/>\nhasn&#39;t chosen to say any &quot;real&quot; cuss words, but I do hear crap a little more<br/>\noften, and I think he said something sucked the other day.  I&#39;m interested<br/>\nto see what my gut reaction is the first time he cusses &quot;for real&quot;.  I know<br/>\nif he directs it at someone in a mean way I will be upset, but since I don&#39;t<br/>\nuse words to hurt people (including myself), he typically doesn&#39;t either.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I let the F word fly because I&#39;ve dropped something or hurt myself,<br/>\nit&#39;s typically out of shock, or pain, not because I&#39;m angry with myself.  I<br/>\ntend to play with the words, combining them with other words, and have some<br/>\npretty interesting words that I use for different situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEven before unschooling we didn&#39;t censor very much of the music he listens<br/>\nto.  I like rap, and pop and the &quot;popular&quot; music that&#39;s out now, and Parker<br/>\nlikes more Rock, but not quite as heavy as the rock his dad likes which goes<br/>\nall the way to &quot;death metal&quot;.  I occasionally throw some country in there,<br/>\nand we also like music from the Renaissance festivals, so Draven has a<br/>\npretty diverse palate to chose from.  Most of what we listen to ends up<br/>\nhaving some cussing, some talk of sex, some talk of violence, or some talk<br/>\nof drugs.  I think very few popular songs today are without one of the<br/>\nprevious.  Some of the songs we&#39;re used to listening to on the radio, we<br/>\ndon&#39;t like as much once we hear them uncensored.  Some we like more.<br/>\n Sometimes we talk about why the artist used that particular word there, and<br/>\nwhy we think it sounds better on the censored version.    Sometimes we<br/>\ndiscuss how the censoring can totally change the meaning for a particular<br/>\nsong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas your daughter heard the uncensored versions of those songs.  Does she<br/>\nstill like them once they aren&#39;t the same song she&#39;s heard on the radio?<br/>\n<br/>\nDraven has been going to concerts with us since he was 6 or so.  He still<br/>\ntalks about all of them.  He has amazing memories of seeing the musicians he<br/>\nloves actually preforming live.  In most cases he&#39;s gotten to meet them, and<br/>\nget autographs and shake their hand.  Some of them played songs that he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t like, so we&#39;d walk out of the area for awhile.  Some of them were<br/>\nvery loud, so we always brought ear plugs.  Sometimes the crowd got a little<br/>\ntoo rough for him during certain songs, so we moved to the back, or used<br/>\nthat time to take a bathroom break.  He doesn&#39;t remember the loudness, or<br/>\nthe songs they sang, or the few times I&#39;d pick him up in a rush and get him<br/>\nout of the area because I didn&#39;t like the way the crowd was moving.  He<br/>\nremembers the lights, and the people on stage, and the people around him,<br/>\nand he REALLY remembers shaking the artists hands and telling them his<br/>\nfavorite song, and typically he also remembers getting complimented on<br/>\nhis Mohawk by the artist (which tends to be his hairstyle of choice when<br/>\nwe&#39;re going to a concert).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s going to remember the parts she enjoys, the cussing really won&#39;t<br/>\nmatter.  It&#39;ll be the atmosphere, all of the sights and sounds and smells<br/>\nand just the feel of being at a concert.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":264461697,"authorName":"JOHN","from":"&quot;JOHN&quot; &lt;ygroups@...&gt;","profile":"jmhnet1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: concert for 11 y/o","postDate":"1270618495","msgId":43585,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhwaDVoditqNzNmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEMwOTVDQkJFLUM5QTMtNEQ0Ri04RDg3LTA5RDEyRjAwM0JEQkBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43584,"nextInTopic":43586,"prevInTime":43584,"nextInTime":43586,"topicId":43577,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I admit the &quot;control&quot; aspect of my response. It&#39;s fear. I am scared that my innocent, precious little girl will actually grow up and learn about the pain in this world, the pain that has touched me, that has undoubtedly touched so many of us. Maybe its instinct gone awry. As her father, I want to protect her, shield her, never see that spark of wonder leave her brilliant eyes. But who am I to do that? If I am acting out of my own fears, I am doing it for completely selfish reasons. If I can stop her from learning about sex, or swear words, or violence, misogyny, terror, hate, racism, drugs, addiction, abuse, rape, suffering, and so much more, I can somehow save her. But it is really me I want to save. <br/>\nI know I know I know... I have to let her go. I have to release her into this world and allow her to be herself. &quot;But not yet&quot; I scream inside. She&#39;s too young, she&#39;s only 11! She should know nothing of Sept 11, she shouldn&#39;t know of war or suicide or genocide. Not until she&#39;s 16. Or maybe 21. How about 30.<br/>\nEvery day I walk this unschooling path is another day of encountering myself. Facing what I hate about myself, facing the foundation of my fears. It comes up when I feel the resistance. Then I see my chance to right all the wrongs done to me, and I turn to my children. No, I can&#39;t use them for that. They can not be my redeemers, and I can not be their savior. <br/>\nBut why does it hurt so much? To let go? My wife knows the &quot;look&quot; all too well. When something comes on the TV, I look at her with the &quot;change the channel&quot; look, or the &quot;why are you letting her watch this are you crazy&quot; look. I mean, isn&#39;t my wife supposed to be with me on this?<br/>\nWe all like the main-stream Black Eyed Peas songs, but I don&#39;t think any of us has heard much more of their stuff. They let the s**t and f**k words fly. Will my daughter start saying &quot;f**k&quot; every time she drops something, in the same self-punishing way that I sometimes do (I never swear around my kids, mostly at work). I don&#39;t want her to hate herself for dropping something. <br/>\nListen to me! OMG the control! I have no control over whether she hates herself! What I can control is me (and even that has its limits). Control IS an illusion. It keeps me in a false world, one that *I* create. In that world, I know what&#39;s coming next. In that world, I can keep the pain away.<br/>\nI&#39;m unlearning 40 years of doing it the way I&#39;ve been doing it. Maybe during the next 40 years, I&#39;ll have unlearned all of it, so I can start fresh. By then, my kids will have kids (or not), and I&#39;ll have fully embraced the gift of letting go. Until then, I&#39;ll keep taking the steps. Things like this concert might just end up being my unteachers. And who knows, maybe it won&#39;t take 40 years to unlearn.<br/>\nThanks for letting me get this out.<br/>\n-john</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":302010303,"authorName":"sharon","from":"&quot;sharon&quot; &lt;1drflmthr@...&gt;","profile":"sharonjemerson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: concert for 11 y/o","postDate":"1270593041","msgId":43584,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhwZ2NtaCs5MWZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFEMUZDMDFELTEwRUQtNEM0OS1CMzk2LUMzMEQ5RkRGODkzNEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":43582,"nextInTopic":43585,"prevInTime":43583,"nextInTime":43585,"topicId":43577,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey, Thank you for your responses so far.

Joyce, I agree wholeheartedly with what you said about the control, etc. I forwarded your response to my husband. I am all for going to the concert with my dtr. I didn&#39;t even second guess it until hubby spoke up. He is still stuck in fear and control mode sometimes. He also can get upset when I just go ahead and do things without consulting or considering his point of view. Understandable. Seems it is more an issue about us talking about it together and me explaining more of the RU concept. He is mostly on board with me, we just hit these bumps once in a while. <br/>\nMy dtr and I have listened and watched some of their songs on Youtube. We have also seen them perform on an awards show and on Oprah. I think it would be an awesome concert. I&#39;d be curious to see what she thinks of the experience. <br/>\nThis afternoon I remembered that there is a live Black Eyed Peas concert playing in the movie theaters. I looked it up and unfortunately it was just last week on March 30th. Bummer!! My dtr says she would rather see a live concert anyway. She says she wants to see what it is like. I am honored that she wants to go with me. I never went to a rock concert with my mother.
