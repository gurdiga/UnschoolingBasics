My name is Shannon.  I am a 40 yr old Mom to three fantastic<br/>\nkids.  Two dd&#39;s, 10 and 8, and a ds, just 3.  We live in Ontario, on a rural<br/>\nproperty.  Our kids have been homeschooled in an unschooled fashion from the<br/>\nstart. I watched them grow from infants to toddlers to young children,<br/>\nsoaking up everything around them and learning at an amazing speed.  I<br/>\nfigured why mess with that success by teaching them anything.  I see my role<br/>\nas faciliator, or tour guide, along their journey.  I joined this list on<br/>\nthe recommendation of a fellow homeschooling support group member.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say that I have had much experience on a variety of lists and<br/>\nhomeschooling boards, so I know not everyone will agree.  I think alot of<br/>\nwonderful information can come out of debates.  I also realize that not<br/>\neverything will come packaged just the way I personally prefer it and have<br/>\ndeveloped the skill of taking what I need and leaving the rest.  I find<br/>\nmyself in a very comfortable place in our journey.  We all are finding what<br/>\nis working for us, is working for us.  When it isn&#39;t, we make the necessary<br/>\nadjustments. So I don&#39;t feel the need to be defensive about where we are or<br/>\nwhat we are doing. Or justify our choices.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a newbie, for the most part, I am finding the posts helpful, informative<br/>\nand can sense that the overall intent is quite genuinely helpful..looking<br/>\nforward to reading more and getting to know all of you as time goes by.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25368,"nextTopicId":25401}}
