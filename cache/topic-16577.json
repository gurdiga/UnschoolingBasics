There are a<br/>\nton of great math resources out there for kids that are really, truly<br/>\ninterested in learning certain facts. I&#39;m sure Pam S has a nice list<br/>\nof recommendations for things that would help a child when they want a<br/>\nspecific body of knowledge in that area.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a very different thing from trying to help her &quot;graduate&quot; from<br/>\nWHAT?? She&#39;s unschooled. There is no graduation. It&#39;s just living life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she&#39;s interested in math facts, the last thing I&#39;d do is give her a<br/>\ncurriculum like Saxon. Yucky. I think the recommendation of F.U.N.<br/>\nbooks is great...they have loads of cool stuff. If she&#39;s that<br/>\nfascinated with it, maybe she does want a tutor or class. Our purpose<br/>\nhere, for this list and discussion, is how to help people<br/>\nunschool...not how to help them get more schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16556,"nextTopicId":16565}}
