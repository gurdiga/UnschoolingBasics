Not just any goal that seems worthwhile but the goal of <br/>\nunschooling.

Unschoolers are <br/>\nthe least likely people to help you feel ok about a decision to place limits <br/>\non your kid.   We can help you think about why you feel the need to control <br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s choices, or help you find ways to feel better about your <br/>\nson&#39;s choices or give you ideas to make his world really interesting so that <br/>\nhis TV choices are only one small part of his big life, but if you want <br/>\napproval for limiting him, an unschooling list probably won&#39;t help you.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** I am ready to drop it now.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou certainly don&#39;t have to respond to any post, but please understand ideas <br/>\ntake on a life of their own once they&#39;re out.
