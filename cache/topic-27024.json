More connection and communication is what&#39;s needed - real <br/>\ncommunication, not just parents running our mouths off bc we&#39;re too <br/>\ncaught up in our own stuff to look any further. I use repetition as <br/>\na sort of &quot;red flag&quot; in my mind - if I hear myself saying the same <br/>\ndarn thing more than a couple times Woah-up there, Momma! Time to <br/>\nstop whatever I think I&#39;m doing and pay attention to the real kin in <br/>\nfront of me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; While I do try to let the kids be more independent, they are still <br/>\n </span></blockquote>kids<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and members of a family that cares for each other. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a little bit of unschooling jargon for ya: &quot;autonomy&quot; is a <br/>\ndifferent thing that independence. From an unschooling standpoint, <br/>\nits the ability to get needs and desires met. For very young <br/>\nchildren/babies, we facilitate autonomy mainly by meeting their <br/>\nneeds directly - nursing, diaper changing, picking them up, holding <br/>\nthem, swinging.... all that stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs kids get older they become more able to get their needs <br/>\nmet &quot;independently&quot; but not all of them all the time - and they <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to *have* to do it by themselves all the time. So there&#39;s <br/>\na loooooooooong transitional period where supporting a kid&#39;s <br/>\nautonomy is about making space for that kid to do things <br/>\nindependently, while still being available to help - even with <br/>\nthings that child *can do already*. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s something that can continue right on up to adulthood - think <br/>\nabout it, how often do you ask another adult for help with something <br/>\nyou are perfectly capable of doing? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For example, my daughter counts on Mommy&#39;s wake up<br/>\n&gt; call, just as I count on the morning cup of coffee my husband <br/>\n&gt;provides. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right, exactly. Its not about pushing independence at all costs <br/>\n(eegads!).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My 8-year-old son doesn&#39;t always remember to brush his teeth,<br/>\n&gt; and doesn&#39;t notice any difference in how his mouth feels.  I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>notice his<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; bad breath when we work together.  Of course, I kindly remind him <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; brush his teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One alternative would be to talk about his breath without going <br/>\nstraight to the solution - I forget that myself and tend to go <br/>\nstraight to solutions. After all, my solutions are fabulous! Why <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t anyone just want me to tell them what to.... oh, oops. <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of supporting autonomy is giving our kids the space to think of <br/>\nsome of those fabulous solutions on their own - the other part is <br/>\nthen being willing to help them problem-solve if those &quot;solutions&quot; <br/>\naren&#39;t exactly what they hoped. To use a montessori truism: &quot;kids <br/>\nlearn to make decisions by making decisions&quot; and that includes less <br/>\nthan sucessful decisions, so they can experience the whole process <br/>\n*with our support* backing them up, and helping them figure out <br/>\nthe &quot;what now&quot;? parts. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Of course, I kindly remind him to<br/>\n&gt; brush his teeth.

If he&#39;s not <br/>\nused to this kind of problem solving (if mom jumps to solutions, why <br/>\nshould he be?) he might need some prompting. Can you set up the <br/>\ntoothbrushing somewhere different? Can y&#39;all look into mouth rinses <br/>\nfor first thing in the morning? Gum? A tongue scraper? Maybe y&#39;all <br/>\ncould look into some of the causes of bad-breath together and find <br/>\nyet more possibilities - like a change of night-time snacks, or more <br/>\nhumidity in the bedroom or a nasal rinse?

I don&#39;t think anyone here is saying &quot;hands off&quot;. When rules<br/>\n&gt; and arbitrary limits and authoritarian demands are removed and we<br/>\n&gt; choose to take children seriously we are, in fact, committing<br/>\n&gt; ourselves to be *more* aware and engaged than traditional parenting<br/>\n&gt; models call for. Unschooling and respectful parenting is so much more<br/>\n&gt; *hands on* than conventional approaches, imo. It&#39;s not about giving a<br/>\n&gt; command and expecting immediate compliance or making a set of rules<br/>\n&gt; and then considering my job finished (unless one of the rules is<br/>\n&gt; broken).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s working *with* our children, being present to their needs,<br/>\n&gt; emotions, experiences, and curiosities.

My son frequently forgets where he was headed / what he was<br/>\n&gt; going to do and it happens with teeth brushing, too. There is much<br/>\n&gt; less stress if we go to do it together. I give him a piggyback ride to<br/>\n&gt; the bathroom, sometimes he brushes his teeth and sometimes he wants me<br/>\n&gt; to do it. I don&#39;t mind helping him brush at all, I think it helps him<br/>\n&gt; figure out the sensations and movements of what a good teeth brushing<br/>\n&gt; feels like. We talk about each part of his mouth and he asks<br/>\n&gt; questions, etc. Since he&#39;s fiercely independent in many ways, it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; treat for me to be able to do something *for* him. We pause to<br/>\n&gt; chit-chat and giggle. Sometimes we&#39;ll brush our teeth together or<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;ll want to brush mine for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If told him to go do it he&#39;d make it halfway down the hallway and<br/>\n&gt; start playing. I&#39;d get frustrated, remind him again, direct him toward<br/>\n&gt; the bathroom, spot him in the living room a few moments later and<br/>\n&gt; discover he still hadn&#39;t brushed his teeth. I&#39;d send him down the<br/>\n&gt; hallway again with my patience rapidly decreasing, and so on until<br/>\n&gt; eventually I was close to yelling and all but dragging him into the<br/>\n&gt; bathroom or on the verge of making threats like &quot;no bedtime story&quot;<br/>\n&gt; etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is a principal behind the act of teeth brushing - taking care of<br/>\n&gt; ourselves so we stay healthy. Both ways are trying to meet this goal.<br/>\n&gt; One way tries to figure out how to make it happen in the most joyful,<br/>\n&gt; non-coercive way. There are no commands, rules or punishments<br/>\n&gt; involved. It does, however, require me to be *present* and actively<br/>\n&gt; engaged with him to accomplish the brushing of teeth.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other way is the opposite. It starts with me thinking I can issue<br/>\n&gt; a command and have it obeyed and that should be the extent of my<br/>\n&gt; involvement. Every time he needs redirecting my frustration level<br/>\n&gt; grows because I&#39;m not suppose to have to intervene - I said &quot;do it&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and that should have been it. I choose to turn it into a battle of<br/>\n&gt; wills and to take his inability to complete the task on my timetable<br/>\n&gt; as a sign of disrespect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Which way is respectful towards the child and is more pleasant for<br/>\n&gt; both of us? Which way is ultimately more hands-on? Which way honors<br/>\n&gt; the relationship?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~ Susan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":203677783,"authorName":"trektheory","from":"&quot;trektheory&quot; &lt;trektheory@...&gt;","profile":"trektheory","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Mom Video","postDate":"1192332817","msgId":27090,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZlczJtaCtoYWt2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ3Y2Q5MGUyMDcxMDEzMTYxMWw2ZTc2MzYzN3U0ODcxMjdhMDkzZTI0YWQ5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27085,"nextInTopic":27101,"prevInTime":27089,"nextInTime":27091,"topicId":27024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;d send him down the<br/>\nhallway again with my patience rapidly decreasing, and so on until<br/>\neventually I was close to yelling and all but dragging him into the<br/>\nbathroom or on the verge of making threats like &quot;no bedtime story&quot;<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a principal behind the act of teeth brushing - taking care of<br/>\nourselves so we stay healthy.

It does, however, require me to be *present* and actively<br/>\nengaged with him to accomplish the brushing of teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other way is the opposite. It starts with me thinking I can issue<br/>\na command and have it obeyed and that should be the extent of my<br/>\ninvolvement. Every time he needs redirecting my frustration level<br/>\ngrows because I&#39;m not suppose to have to intervene - I said &quot;do it&quot;<br/>\nand that should have been it. I choose to turn it into a battle of<br/>\nwills and to take his inability to complete the task on my timetable<br/>\nas a sign of disrespect.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich way is respectful towards the child and is more pleasant for<br/>\nboth of us?

I&#39;ve always modeled and<br/>\nencouraged being respectful of other peoples&#39; feelings.  However, one of<br/>\nthe reasons this video strikes a chord is due to what the comedian<br/>\ndescribes as the &#39;cosmic Groundhog Day&#39; where moms (and dads) often find<br/>\nthemselves saying the same things over & over.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I do try to let the kids be more independent, they are still kids<br/>\nand members of a family that cares for each other.  They count on me to<br/>\ngive them reminders or to point out things that are obvious to an adult,<br/>\nbut not to them.  For example, my daughter counts on Mommy&#39;s wake up<br/>\ncall, just as I count on the morning cup of coffee my husband provides. <br/>\nThese aren&#39;t necessary, but the morning doesn&#39;t go as well when they are<br/>\nmissing.  My 8-year-old son doesn&#39;t always remember to brush his teeth,<br/>\nand doesn&#39;t notice any difference in how his mouth feels.  I notice his<br/>\nbad breath when we work together.  Of course, I kindly remind him to<br/>\nbrush his teeth.  Still, in route to the upstairs bathroom, he forgets<br/>\nwhy he went upstairs.  So, again I remind him to please brush his teeth.<br/>\nSometimes, this happens several times.  I suppose I could give up on<br/>\nworking with him and wait a few days until his grungy mouth bothers him<br/>\nas well.  I&#39;m not too fond of that solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past, I&#39;ve tried to persuade the children to do what is necessary<br/>\nbecause it is important to them personally or to our family.  In light<br/>\nof this discussion, I will think about whether my requests or reminders<br/>\ncan be perceived as authoritarian orders.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the food for thought!
