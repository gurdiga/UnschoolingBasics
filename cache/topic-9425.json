","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1370418253\">&quot;&gt;&gt;My middle son (age 10 next month)<br/>\nis still having a very hard time reading. &gt;&gt;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to see him as &quot;learning to read&quot; not having &quot;a very hard time<br/>\nreading&quot;. <br/>\nHe&#39;s in the process, the process just looks very, VERY different from<br/>\nchild to child. I really wish I could back up my next statement with a<br/>\nlink, but I don&#39;t even remember where I read it at this point. You&#39;ll<br/>\njust have to trust me;)(scary, I know).<br/>\n<br/>\nI read once that the &quot;average&quot; ages for children to read are anywhere<br/>\nbetween 3 and 12. That&#39;s AVERAGE. There were children that were<br/>\noutside those &quot;normal&quot; parameters, either earlier or later (and<br/>\naccording to this research, it was NOT problematic for a child to be<br/>\nlater at all) but that our society has become so brainwashed by the<br/>\nschool system, most folks think 5-7 is &quot;normal&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Jared at age 10 was not reading. He was learning to read, but he<br/>\nasked us to read EVERYTHING to him at that age. Everything.<br/>\nOnce we read his game cards over and over, he would remember them. He<br/>\ncould remember literally hundreds of cards, hundreds of game symbols<br/>\nbut he couldn&#39;t decipher the alphabet or written words.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the world, he was a &quot;non-reader&quot;. I could see he was learning more<br/>\nand more as he asked about words, why they sounded a certain way,<br/>\nwhere letters came from etc... He was curious.<br/>\n<br/>\nUp until very recently (he was 12 in August) he didn&#39;t read fluently.<br/>\nAll of the sudden, he&#39;s not only reading better than his younger<br/>\nsister (who has been reading much longer than him) he&#39;s writing and<br/>\ntyping. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe was just on the game &quot;Kalonline&quot; (which requires talking to other<br/>\nplayers) and when I walked in the room the game was gone and a message<br/>\nin my search bar said &quot;it&#39;s all yours Mom&quot;. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe types messages all the time now!! He&#39;s asking how to spell things<br/>\nall the time and is reading quickly. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t stress. Try to see your child as &quot;learning&quot;, not having<br/>\n&quot;trouble&quot;. It will happen, just not on someone elses time table and<br/>\nNOT nearly as well if you push.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9423,"nextTopicId":9429}}
