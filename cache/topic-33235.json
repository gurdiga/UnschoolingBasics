Kids who get services are not <br/>\nnecessarily better off. Our son was evaluated as developmentally <br/>\ndelayed by 2 years in nearly every area measured. He spent 2+ years <br/>\nin Special Education pre-K classrooms and 1 year in Kindergarten. He <br/>\nreceived Speech, Physical, and Occupational Therapy from the school, <br/>\nand also outside Speech and Physical Therapy.  We struggled every <br/>\nyear to get Individual Education Plans that made sense - because the <br/>\ntherapists would set goals that he could already achieve.... (Gosh, <br/>\nit sure is easy to show progress/success that way.) When he went to <br/>\nKindergarten (mainstream) he had an Inclusion Teacher (separate from <br/>\nthe K teacher) who was dedicated to help certain kids in the <br/>\nclassroom and he had accomodations for tests. Even so, Kindergarten <br/>\nwas a yukky experience. He could not keep pace, and so he frequently <br/>\nbrought class work to finish at home, in addition to homework. <br/>\nHomework was an hour or more of struggle everyday. He also frequently <br/>\nbrought home negative behavioral marks, which were usually poorly <br/>\nexplained by the teacher. I actually keep a copy of the &quot;classroom <br/>\nrules&quot; on my nightstand in case my resolve to unschool ever weakens <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly believe that he would have been better served if he had <br/>\nbeen home those 3+ years. In hindsight, I regret the choice we made. <br/>\nHowever, this experience did lead us to homeshooling, which led us to <br/>\nunschooling. That is a positive outcome. I trust that he will recover <br/>\nsome of what he lost in school because he is young (7). <br/>\n<br/>\nMy observation is that services for kids, whether through the school <br/>\nor privately paid, are not always high quality. And, you have much <br/>\nless influence with school-affiliated service providers than you do <br/>\nwith private providers. I also believe that parents can provide many <br/>\nof the same learning opportunities that therapists provide. <br/>\nTherapists may be specialists, but that does not make their skills <br/>\nunattainable to someone motivated to help their own child. <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163698313,"authorName":"Dory","from":"&quot;Dory&quot; &lt;carzmom2000@...&gt;","profile":"carzmom2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: 5 yr old boy voted out of class by teacher/students-xpost/Joyce","postDate":"1212230695","msgId":33282,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcxcmE3NytrbmQyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEMzODUzRTUwLThBRDctNDA0QS05MUY3LTNCRUJEREMwNkYyNEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":33278,"nextInTopic":33291,"prevInTime":33281,"nextInTime":33283,"topicId":33235,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... worth it.
