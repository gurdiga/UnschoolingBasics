They might seem to make sense on some level (usually the level or<br/>\nour wounded-in-childhood selves) so we hold onto them and reuse them but<br/>\nhaven&#39;t really thought about them.   I think the phrase &quot;slave to your<br/>\nchildren&quot; is one of those things. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere along the way some people come to feel they have no choices. <br/>\nHow did that happen?  It happens to some people who are told &quot;we all have<br/>\nto do things we don&#39;t want to&quot; by parents who want to dismiss the<br/>\nworries, hurts and complaints of their kids.   But we do have a choice. <br/>\nHaving kids was a choice and knowing that kids create a lot more work for<br/>\nus we made that choice anyway.   Looking after and helping other people<br/>\nis a choice.  How we think about helping others is a choice. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if someone is a &quot;slave&quot; to their children are the children then the<br/>\noverlords?  How did they get that way?  I mean, who treated them so<br/>\nunkindly, created such an example for them that they grew, in a few short<br/>\nyears, into heartless beings who would happily enslave their own mothers?<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was as study about altruism and the researcher found that little<br/>\nbabies are good for the sake of goodness.  Little babies.   Who turns<br/>\nthem into slave owners?   Moms who feel like slaves to their children<br/>\nhave more going on than a messy house and I think very little of that, if<br/>\nany, has to do with the kids or the mess.     <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we&#39;re doing it right our kids lives are full of fun and possibility.<br/>\nKids don&#39;t see messes, they see fun.  They are not &quot;leaving messes&quot; for<br/>\ntheir mom they are doing what children do.  They are playing and being<br/>\nand growing and learning.   Children don&#39;t think &quot;I&#39;m going to make a<br/>\nmess and I&#39;m going to leave it for my mom because I want her to feel like<br/>\nmy slave.&quot;   They play.  That joy and imagination is just so cool.  <br/>\nIf we think that we might become enslaved by the work of looking after a<br/>\nhome and kids we&#39;re turning their innocent joy into something sinister. <br/>\nIf a mom is determined to feel abused by her family she&#39;s going to look<br/>\naround at her happy kids and think they&#39;re happy because they have a<br/>\nslave.  She&#39;s going to see their inventions and creations, not as<br/>\nevidence they were having fun but as &quot;messes left for mom to clean up.&quot;  <br/>\nIt is a really unkind way to think of our kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is choice and it is choice-in-attitude and at the heart of that is<br/>\nphilosophy.  Some people don&#39;t think they have choice, don&#39;t think they<br/>\ncan benefit from choosing a different attitude, haven&#39;t ever considered<br/>\nwhat might be their life&#39;s philosophy.   But it&#39;s worth looking at<br/>\nbecause anything that keeps moms thinking resentfully of their children<br/>\nwill stand in the way of unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen some people get mad at the suggestion they stop using some<br/>\nwords or phrases to describe their kid or their relationship or what<br/>\nthey&#39;re doing.  The language might be an indicator that the thinking<br/>\ncould use some tweaking.  Sometimes it turns out we don&#39;t even really<br/>\nthink that way but we&#39;ve been using the language for so long we forgot to<br/>\nlook at our kids in the positive light of love.  It&#39;s one easy step in<br/>\nthe direction of a happier and more respectful life with kids.   It will<br/>\nmake it easier to really understand unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196090915,"authorName":"jnjstau@direcway.com","from":"jnjstau@...","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: I&#39;m new and unsure","postDate":"1142473688","msgId":10811,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4YTUxZTM4OGQ0MS4zODhkNDEzOGE1MWVAZGlyZWN3YXkuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10803,"nextInTopic":10883,"prevInTime":10810,"nextInTime":10812,"topicId":10557,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Actually, you can look at it about a hundred different ways","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-11986771\">&lt;&lt;you can look at housework as a gift to your family or you can look at it as a hated chore...&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, you can look at it about a hundred different ways in between those two extremes.

Making other people do your bidding, in the <br/>\n&gt; long run,<br/>\n&gt; makes them bitter and not wanting to help.  Choosing to do things <br/>\n&gt; for my<br/>\n&gt; family, does not make me a slave to them.  I have the right to <br/>\n&gt; choose to<br/>\n&gt; clean or not and they also have the right to choose to clean or not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t HAVE to do housework.  The housework police aren&#39;t going <br/>\n&gt; to swoop<br/>\n&gt; down and take me away.  I do choose to do housework regularly <br/>\n&gt; though because<br/>\n&gt; I value having a clean house.  My children often help without my <br/>\n&gt; asking and<br/>\n&gt; when I do ask them to help, most of the time they pitch right in <br/>\n&gt; and help<br/>\n&gt; sometiems right then or as soon as they aren&#39;t busy.  They know <br/>\n&gt; they can say<br/>\n&gt; no though and that I will not try to make them feel guilty about it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My kids keep a lot of toys out on a regular basis and we are a <br/>\n&gt; very careful<br/>\n&gt; family and it&#39;s not often that anything gets stepped on and broken.<br/>\n&gt; However, if we are planning on having company that isn&#39;t quite as <br/>\n&gt; careful as<br/>\n&gt; we are, the girls work hard to pick up their things before they <br/>\n&gt; come and put<br/>\n&gt; them in a more appropriate place.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All that said, it really makes a different to your own peace, <br/>\n&gt; depending on<br/>\n&gt; how you look at it.

Respecting children isn&#39;t  \r<br/>\nsacrifice it&#39;s treating them as we would like to be treated. Not little<br/>\nadults  but \r<br/>\nspoken to in kindness and not birthed to be our cleaning crew. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMore than one list is good.  I was on a local list/group who pushed  \r<br/>\nunschooling, advertised as unschool but told families that spanking and <br/>\nunschooling \r<br/>\nwith required math and English was unschooling. That families  should just<br/>\ndo \r<br/>\nwhatever works for them whatever and how they define it.  Spankings,<br/>\nrequired \r<br/>\nsubjects,rules,chores, limits on freedoms that even PS kids  have is not \r<br/>\nunschooling and respecting children. Yes, it can get confusing with  all the<br/>\nfamily \r<br/>\nvalues out there but force/coercion and unschooling do not mix. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy kids happily learned how to do laundry. They actually want to do it BC <br/>\nwe \r<br/>\njust purchased front loaders and they are electronic. We don&#39;t  have &quot;chores<br/>\n \r<br/>\nbut there are things I ask them to help me with as they would ask  me. Our \r<br/>\nhome is busy, we have 5 dogs and four kids and life can get crazy. Too  boot<br/>\nwe \r<br/>\nre adding a home addition (raising the roof soon) so it&#39;s going to  really \r<br/>\ntest our family&#39;s patience. That said we DO NOT have daily  &quot;rules or chores<br/>\n \r<br/>\nthat they have assigned to them.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI look at it this way.. I don&#39;t want my Dh to leave in the am and say &quot;You  \r<br/>\nneed to do the laundry, wash the floors, take out the trash, wash the dog,<br/>\nfeed \r<br/>\nthe dogs , take them out,weigh the puppies, call the vet&quot; etc.. YKWIM?  \r<br/>\nTherefor....... I don&#39;t do that to my children. If I need help.. I ask but I<br/>\ndo  \r<br/>\nnot say &quot;you are going to learn this BC I said so&quot;. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYour children will know from watching you. They may even offer to  help.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhat I wonder is....\r<br/>\nWhat happens if they don&#39;t want to help?\r<br/>\nDo they lose something?\r<br/>\nAre they &quot;disciplined&quot;?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI suspect you may have been on one the larger unschool lists. You may have  \r<br/>\neven been in conversation with one of the older seasoned unschoolers. Did <br/>\nyou \r<br/>\nstay to listen? Did you ask questions? Was there a read for a few  weeks \r<br/>\nposting guideline?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIs it possible that some with years of experience just might have wisdom to <br/>\n\r<br/>\noffer? Are we not on lists to learn and help others get to unschooling? If<br/>\nwe  \r<br/>\njust listen when someone agrees does that mean we are learning and <br/>\nchanging?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI understand where the posts are going but this being a basics/new  \r<br/>\nunschooling list there needs to be clarity. Discipline means many things and<br/>\nfor  those \r<br/>\njust reading it may be sending mixed messages.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSome don&#39;t use the word discipline BC they simply don&#39;t need to use it in  \r<br/>\ntheir home. That doesn&#39;t mean wild children that means everyone knows and  \r<br/>\nrespects each other.\r<br/>\nSome rather than discipline talk to each other...\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLaura\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS Secondary school education Graduate school education Home<br/>\nschool education \r<br/>\nGraduate school education online High school education Chicago school<br/>\neducation \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYAHOO!

I have seven kids, and I  \r<br/>\n*was* worried that I would be slaving all day to keep the house clean  \r<br/>\nand kids happy. But kids WANT to help. And if you ask them, usually  \r<br/>\nthey will UNLESS they have been bossed around so much they get  \r<br/>\nresentful. What the other list was saying is that you should be open  \r<br/>\nto them saying, &quot;Not right now&quot; Or being aware that what they are  \r<br/>\ndoing is a legitimate learning experience and it&#39;s not fair to  \r<br/>\ninterrupt and say, take the trash out RIGHT NOW. I did spend a few  \r<br/>\nweeks not having them do anything. I focused every day on providing  \r<br/>\nthem with snacks and cleaning the house. and it went really well. Now  \r<br/>\nI&#39;ve started asking them again to help with dishes, laundry, etc. And  \r<br/>\nthey usually step right up and say ok. Sometimes they kind of go &quot;Aw  \r<br/>\nmom...I&#39;m reading right now&quot; or &quot;Can I finish this game first?&quot; and I  \r<br/>\nsay okay. Because next week, much less a hundred years from now, does  \r<br/>\nit really matter when they did the dishes? Not unless I make it an  \r<br/>\nissue and make everything ugly.\r<br/>\nSince your kids are members of your team, that would imply that they  \r<br/>\nhave equal rights and equal say in how they will help. And when they  \r<br/>\nwill help. If I nagged my daughters all day that they needed to put  \r<br/>\naway their laundry, would they have chosen to stay up late one night  \r<br/>\nand fold EVERYONE&#39;S laundry and put it away? Probably not, they would  \r<br/>\nhave been so resentful of being told what to do, that it never would  \r<br/>\nhave occurred to be so generous with their time and energy. I think  \r<br/>\nwhat&#39;s important is what is in your heart and how you have your  \r<br/>\nchildren help.

I have seven kids, and I  <br/>\n*was* worried that I would be slaving all day to keep the house clean  <br/>\nand kids happy. But kids WANT to help. And if you ask them, usually  <br/>\nthey will UNLESS they have been bossed around so much they get  <br/>\nresentful. What the other list was saying is that you should be open  <br/>\nto them saying, &quot;Not right now&quot; Or being aware that what they are  <br/>\ndoing is a legitimate learning experience and it&#39;s not fair to  <br/>\ninterrupt and say, take the trash out RIGHT NOW. I did spend a few  <br/>\nweeks not having them do anything. I focused every day on providing  <br/>\nthem with snacks and cleaning the house. and it went really well. Now  <br/>\nI&#39;ve started asking them again to help with dishes, laundry, etc. And  <br/>\nthey usually step right up and say ok. Sometimes they kind of go &quot;Aw  <br/>\nmom...I&#39;m reading right now&quot; or &quot;Can I finish this game first?&quot; and I  <br/>\nsay okay. Because next week, much less a hundred years from now, does  <br/>\nit really matter when they did the dishes? Not unless I make it an  <br/>\nissue and make everything ugly.<br/>\nSince your kids are members of your team, that would imply that they  <br/>\nhave equal rights and equal say in how they will help. And when they  <br/>\nwill help. If I nagged my daughters all day that they needed to put  <br/>\naway their laundry, would they have chosen to stay up late one night  <br/>\nand fold EVERYONE&#39;S laundry and put it away? Probably not, they would  <br/>\nhave been so resentful of being told what to do, that it never would  <br/>\nhave occurred to be so generous with their time and energy. I think  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s important is what is in your heart and how you have your  <br/>\nchildren help. If you pull the grownup card and legislate, that&#39;s not  <br/>\ntrusting your children&#39;s heart or their growth.<br/>\nI would say if what you&#39;re doing works and the kids are happy, then  <br/>\nwhy are you worried about what other people say?

Respecting children isn&#39;t  <br/>\nsacrifice it&#39;s treating them as we would like to be treated. Not little adults  but <br/>\nspoken to in kindness and not birthed to be our cleaning crew. <br/>\n <br/>\nMore than one list is good.  I was on a local list/group who pushed  <br/>\nunschooling, advertised as unschool but told families that spanking and  unschooling <br/>\nwith required math and English was unschooling. That families  should just do <br/>\nwhatever works for them whatever and how they define it.  Spankings, required <br/>\nsubjects,rules,chores, limits on freedoms that even PS kids  have is not <br/>\nunschooling and respecting children. Yes, it can get confusing with  all the family <br/>\nvalues out there but force/coercion and unschooling do not mix. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids happily learned how to do laundry. They actually want to do it BC  we <br/>\njust purchased front loaders and they are electronic. We don&#39;t  have &quot;chores&quot; <br/>\nbut there are things I ask them to help me with as they would ask  me. Our <br/>\nhome is busy, we have 5 dogs and four kids and life can get crazy. Too  boot we <br/>\nre adding a home addition (raising the roof soon) so it&#39;s going to  really <br/>\ntest our family&#39;s patience. That said we DO NOT have daily  &quot;rules or chores&quot; <br/>\nthat they have assigned to them.<br/>\n <br/>\nI look at it this way.. I don&#39;t want my Dh to leave in the am and say &quot;You  <br/>\nneed to do the laundry, wash the floors, take out the trash, wash the dog, feed <br/>\n the dogs , take them out,weigh the puppies, call the vet&quot; etc.. YKWIM?  <br/>\nTherefor....... I don&#39;t do that to my children. If I need help.. I ask but I do  <br/>\nnot say &quot;you are going to learn this BC I said so&quot;. <br/>\n <br/>\nYour children will know from watching you. They may even offer to  help.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I wonder is....<br/>\nWhat happens if they don&#39;t want to help?<br/>\nDo they lose something?<br/>\nAre they &quot;disciplined&quot;?<br/>\n <br/>\nI suspect you may have been on one the larger unschool lists. You may have  <br/>\neven been in conversation with one of the older seasoned unschoolers. Did  you <br/>\nstay to listen? Did you ask questions? Was there a read for a few  weeks <br/>\nposting guideline?<br/>\n <br/>\nIs it possible that some with years of experience just might have wisdom to  <br/>\noffer? Are we not on lists to learn and help others get to unschooling? If we  <br/>\njust listen when someone agrees does that mean we are learning and  changing?<br/>\n <br/>\nI understand where the posts are going but this being a basics/new  <br/>\nunschooling list there needs to be clarity. Discipline means many things and for  those <br/>\njust reading it may be sending mixed messages.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome don&#39;t use the word discipline BC they simply don&#39;t need to use it in  <br/>\ntheir home. That doesn&#39;t mean wild children that means everyone knows and  <br/>\nrespects each other.<br/>\nSome rather than discipline talk to each other...<br/>\n <br/>\nLaura<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":30983993,"authorName":"Lesa McMahon-Lowe","from":"&quot;Lesa McMahon-Lowe&quot; &lt;lesajm@...&gt;","profile":"lesamlowe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: I&#39;m new and unsure","postDate":"1142432189","msgId":10790,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTExNS1EQVY0MUEwRTBFNjZCNEY3MkFBMjBEMzBEM0U2MEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwMzE1MTM1NjQ2LjkxMDgxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjMwMzAyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":10787,"nextInTopic":10792,"prevInTime":10789,"nextInTime":10791,"topicId":10557,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Goodness, what list where you all treated so badly on?

The major problem, is they always use my DH\r<br/>\n&gt; as the chauffer. This\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Fri. he happens to be working overtime and will be\r<br/>\n&gt; exhausted. We are\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unsure how we are to handle this. It&#39;s not just my\r<br/>\n&gt; DH picking this boy\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up, it&#39;s also interferring with the Sat. plans.\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The second thing we are having trouble getting our\r<br/>\n&gt; mind around happened\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this past Sat. We had a party and 4 children\r<br/>\n&gt; stayed over. Between 1 a.m.\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and 8:30 a.m. They devoured most of the food and\r<br/>\n&gt; drinks in the house. My\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children didn&#39;t partake in the feeding frenzy but\r<br/>\n&gt; they didn&#39;t put a stop\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to it. What should our response have been? These\r<br/>\n&gt; kids are all public\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school kids and have very little sense of\r<br/>\n&gt; selfcontrol.\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Remember that we are new to this way of thinking\r<br/>\n&gt; and are wanting to\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; change our mind-set and responses.

You are a family. At our<br/>\n&gt; house that means that<br/>\n&gt; we are a team and everyone has to work together to<br/>\n&gt; make it a pleasant<br/>\n&gt; place to live and be. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Take Care,<br/>\n&gt; Melissa in Oregon <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Thank you so much Melissa for making this point!  I<br/>\n&gt; mentioned on another<br/>\n&gt; list these same points and I was told to shut up, I<br/>\n&gt; was told that as long as<br/>\n&gt; I have <br/>\n&gt; that attitude, I will never be an unschooler.  I was<br/>\n&gt; told that I should not<br/>\n&gt; be posting to the list, I should just<br/>\n&gt; read--basically I was treated like<br/>\n&gt; crap for saying<br/>\n&gt; these exact things--and it made me feel so badly<br/>\n&gt; that I almost considered<br/>\n&gt; giving up on unschooling because if this is how<br/>\n&gt; unschooling<br/>\n&gt; adults treated each other, did I really want to be<br/>\n&gt; one myself? In my house<br/>\n&gt; we are also a team, we work together to keep things<br/>\n&gt; going, we help each<br/>\n&gt; other<br/>\n&gt;  when needed and we strive for daily/monthly/yearly<br/>\n&gt; goals together to make<br/>\n&gt; life more pleasant.  I thought this was a positive<br/>\n&gt; thing, but I was told<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; as long as I expected my children to do anything<br/>\n&gt; around the house, I wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; an unschooler and I was pretty much accused of being<br/>\n&gt; a terrible parent since<br/>\n&gt; I should be happy to handle all the housework and<br/>\n&gt; chores myself as a gift to<br/>\n&gt; my kids. I love my kids to death and would do<br/>\n&gt; anything for them---but there<br/>\n&gt; are 6 <br/>\n&gt;  of them and one of me and not enough hours in the<br/>\n&gt; day to do everything<br/>\n&gt; around here by myself.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I just wanted to let you know how happy I am to see<br/>\n&gt; that others feel and<br/>\n&gt; think the way I do, thank you so much!<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Leslie:-) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;streetresearcher&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;happyfallingleaf@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been reading everything I can find on<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.
