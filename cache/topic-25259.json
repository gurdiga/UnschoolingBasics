My <br/>\nhusband and most of the people we know work in the film and <br/>\ntelevision industry. These shows start with a storyline and script <br/>\nmuch like reality tv shows. Then they try to get the shots to fit <br/>\nwith the script. Sometimes they need to use food or some other <br/>\nstimuli or action to get the animals to perform their role. The <br/>\noriginal nature shows from disney in the sixties had the plots <br/>\npatterned after typical disney stories. I grew up on these and Wild <br/>\nKingdom -another travesty to science.<br/>\nIt is not a conspiracy. It is just giving the viewer something <br/>\npalatable. It is about ratings not science. Have you ever been <br/>\ninterviewed by a news show?  I have been quite a few times. They <br/>\nwrite the story then look for quotes to fit in to the story. They ask <br/>\nyou really leading questions and then they edit your answers to match <br/>\nwhat they want. It is not information gathering, it is news. Two <br/>\ndifferent things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEmilie<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12:40 AM 30/07/2007, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In a message dated 7/29/2007 8:01:41 P.M.
