Maybe<br/>\nthat&#39;s where I differ with hardcore Consensual Living advocates. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our home we constantly strive to meet everyone&#39;s underlying needs.<br/>\nBut there are times with 6 people that one person gives up something<br/>\nin order to make things flow. Sometimes one persons needs are greater<br/>\nthan another person&#39;s (not as a rule, but in the MOMENT).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen dh has a migraine for example, his need for quiet and calm<br/>\noverrides a persons needs for jumping, screaming or otherwise creating<br/>\nloud noises in the house. Same for sleeping people. If I look at the<br/>\nunderlying need (to be loud, movement oriented) there are times I can<br/>\nmeet the need some other way, like going outside, a park etc...<br/>\nAt 11pm, when it&#39;s cold and dark and everyone is tired, then we need<br/>\nto find some way to be quieter. <br/>\n<br/>\nI find so many examples in our lives where we give and take, take and<br/>\ngive to keep the machine oiled so to speak.  Times when the IDEAL of<br/>\nconsensual living collides with reality.

I<br/>\nthink empathy is useful and necessary.....which involves giving up<br/>\nyour own want/desire occasionally. I can see where people do it in an<br/>\nunhealthy  way, but that&#39;s not something I would encourage. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think service to others, giving and compromise are positive tools<br/>\nwhen a person is whole, healthy, strong and able to care for<br/>\nthemselves.

I see compromise as the PROCESS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI live with five other individuals all with their own tastes,<br/>\npreferences etc.... and we use negotiation and compromise as tools to<br/>\nREACH mutually agreeable soluations.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery member has equal weight (though sometimes not in the moment...a<br/>\nsleeping person gets prioritiy over the person that wants to scream<br/>\nand shout in the house) when we&#39;re using our negotiating and<br/>\ncompromise to find soluations. You will often hear me say &quot;how can we<br/>\nmake this work for everyone?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are moments where I DO try to persuade people of a different<br/>\nchoice also, which it sounds to me like consensual living is against.<br/>\nLast week, when we were at the park for our homeschool meetup I had<br/>\ntwo children that wanted to stay and swing after everyone else was<br/>\nexhausted and already in the car wanting to go home NOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nI swung them for a while, after explaining to my other boys, we talked<br/>\nabout how they were waiting and we needed to go soon but after I got<br/>\nback to the car again Jalen protested loudly that he needed to swing<br/>\nmore. The boys weren&#39;t thrilled. At that point I explained how<br/>\nimportant that physical motion was for him, and that they were sitting<br/>\nin a comfortable car with a radio and could they please give me some<br/>\nmore time to swing him? We did so again and I finally was able to<br/>\nconvince Jalen how hungry and tired they were. But without explaining<br/>\nto him several times, he would have stayed for another hour, leaving<br/>\nthem hungry, tired and upset.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times I push for a certain forward momentum because I know<br/>\nand understand where everyone is at. It&#39;s not totally &quot;consensual&quot; but<br/>\nI guess that isn&#39;t my ideal anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think negoatiation and compromise are really useful tools in this<br/>\nworld. I see my kids using them with their friends in a very healthy<br/>\nmanner. Maybe &quot;consensual&quot; isn&#39;t my goal after all. Peaceful, joyful<br/>\nand healthy family is.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Unschooling?

I don&#39;t think compromise is a bad word.  Sometimes when I read about consensual living it sounds like the solution comes only after one person &#39;consents&#39; to want what the others want -- or to give the others what they want.  I know it wouldn&#39;t take long for me to resent always consenting to the other person&#39;s preference.  In compromise, each person gives a little -- not in sacrifice to the other&#39;s whims, but from a genuine desire to see everyone have some joy.  So it&#39;s not a bad thing, but a choice.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My other question about CL is what about those times when consent just isn&#39;t possible, or can&#39;t be waited for?  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Mom to<br/>\n  Will (21) Andy (10) and Dan (5-1/2) <br/>\n   <br/>\n  www.ourhapahome.blogspot.com<br/>\n   <br/>\n    Life is what happens while youre busy making other plans. ~ John Lennon<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nSponsored Link<br/>\n<br/>\n   Mortgage rates as low as 4.625% - $150,000 loan for $579 a month.

I&#39;ve put the original comments in quotes with indentation, my responses are just normal. I am also sending this a second time as it hasn&#39;t come through yet. So, sorry if it turns into a double post.<br/>\n<br/>\n      &quot;I would like to find out more about unschooling without reading another book! (smiles!) &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of great websites that aren&#39;t books, although they are impressive tomes. Joyce&#39;s site <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a> is an amazing place, beautifully linear. And Sandra Dodd&#39;s site <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a> is just a labryinth of interconnected pages and ideas, with golden cords to help you find your way through all the while.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;Currently I&#39;m looking at The Unschooling Handbook. I find this style to be much freer than the way I was taught.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is likely to be much freer than the way any of us were taught. Unschooling isn&#39;t a teaching method, though. It is an approach to education that is about putting aside teaching so that learning can occur. Teaching makes a presumption of a student and an instructor. Unschooling starts with the notion that everyone is a learner and that every situation offers its own learning experience, depending on how you approach it, or how you walk away from it. <br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;I am looking for ways to teach my children by learning about who they are. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would start by putting away the notion of teaching your children. Even when there are things they are learning from you, it is much more helpful to think of yourself as their partner than as their instructor. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/wordswords\">http://sandradodd.com/wordswords</a> is an essay on why using the word teach may be a stumbling block in your understanding of unschooling. What follows is a quote from that essay:<br/>\n<br/>\n        If I want to teach someone how to use quotation marks, I can talk, show them, make jokes, draw stick figures with speech-balloons, and I could maybe sing songs about it. So IF the person who&#39;s in the room &quot;being taught&quot; is thinking about how to file down that one piece of a machine gun that can turn a legal semi-automatic into an illegal automatic, and how to hide that part really well, disguised as something altogether different, what am I doing? <br/>\n<br/>\n        I&#39;m talking, writing, drawing, dancing, and singing. But I&#39;m not teaching. I&#39;m reviewing for myself something I already know. I&#39;m just performing a play of sorts, without any audience. I&#39;m playing with myself. I&#39;m ...well, you know. <br/>\n<br/>\n        So if I&#39;m reading a magazine about machine guns and someone comes and says, &quot;How do I punctuate a quote within a quote?&quot; I can show them. If they don&#39;t totally understand, I can draw pictures or give other examples. When I perceive that they have learned the thing they wanted to learn, I should shush up and go back to my magazine, because the action is completed. .<br/>\n<br/>\n        They learned. I helped them learn. I was &quot;the teacher&quot; but I didn&#39;t do the work that resulted in learning. The learner did that in his own head. I could put ideas in the air, but only he could hear and process and ask more questions. Without his active work, no teaching can possibly take place. <br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;I do not make homemade bread, nor do I have an organic garden. And I&#39;ve occasionally thrown plastic in the garbage. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many people out there who make homemade bread and garden organically and have small holdings with free range chickens and live in a home they built that runs on solar power who, also, happily bid their children farewell ever morning and greet them with a smile every afternoon when they return from school. The two things are not entertwined. And it has been my experience that many of those people who are rigorous about how their food is raised are much more likely to limit their own children&#39;s choice of food. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot; I have my defenses up because I&#39;ve &quot;bumped into&quot; a few unschoolers who have strong opinions about their approach to teaching as though any other style is of Satan!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is easy to be passionate about unschooling. And it is easy for that passion to come across as intolerance. When you have chosen to allow your children to craft their own lives with your help and to support them in whatever interests them, it is hard to watch other people squash their children into whatever box they feel is the best and most appropriate box to view the rest of the world from. There is a real sense that childhood is short and that every day that you spend traditionally parenting is a day that you&#39;ve spent not working to create the best relationship possible with your child. And, I suppose, with that in mind, prostelytizing might become a part of an unschoolers approach to the world. <br/>\n<br/>\n     &quot;I&#39;m hoping someone here has a definition of what unschooling is&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite definition of unschooling comes from here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/unschooling/unschoolingphilosophy.html\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/unschooling/unschoolingphilosophy.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The goal of unschooling is not education. It is to help a child be who she is and blossom into who she will become. Learning happens as a side effect.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling?

I think unschooling lists are a great source of <br/>\ninformation, really wonderful for getting answers to questions in a <br/>\nrelatively short time.  But reading wherever you can, books included will <br/>\nhelp you that much faster.

Imagine yourself their loving outfitter for this long adventure. <br/>\nBe a help to them, be their guide, do things for them and with them and give <br/>\nthem lots of opportunities to do what they want.   Don&#39;t think about <br/>\nteaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour children will be changing every day.  If you focus on who they are <br/>\ntoday then tomorrow you&#39;ll have to find out all over again.   Focus on what <br/>\nthey love to do, on what makes them happy and then help them do as much of <br/>\nthat as they want.   If they like to play outside, then play outside.  If <br/>\nthey like to build forts then build forts.  If they like to do six different <br/>\nthings at once, then get to it! &lt;g&gt; You will learn so much about your kids <br/>\nby letting yourself enjoy their happiness.   When you know what delights <br/>\nthem you can be looking for all kinds of things to add to their lives and to <br/>\ntheir play that will make their world bigger and more interesting.   And <br/>\nremember, every moment they&#39;re alive, they&#39;re learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I need help though.

Learning takes place everywhere, in the big wide world, in the bathtub, <br/>\nin the yard,  and in the little corners of a cozy home where kids are free <br/>\nto play and explore.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I was raised in a home where everyone screamed and fought a lot. I choose <br/>\nto have a gentler life now. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you&#39;ve already made the world a better place by ending the pattern of <br/>\nscreaming and anger.

Anyone thinking of unschooling <br/>\nshould know why they think it&#39;s the best choice for them.  Anyone <br/>\nunschooling should be doing it because it makes sense and is good for their <br/>\nkids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know of people who&#39;ve said, &quot;unschooling isn&#39;t better than any other <br/>\nmethod of homeschooling.&quot;   Then, I want to know why they&#39;re doing it!   If <br/>\nthey don&#39;t think it&#39;s better or if they think something else IS better, why <br/>\ndid they settle for second best for their kids?

I&#39;ve put the original comments in quotes with indentation, my responses are just normal.<br/>\n<br/>\n      &quot;I would like to find out more about unschooling without reading another book! (smiles!) &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of great websites that aren&#39;t books, although they are impressive tomes. Joyce&#39;s site <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a> is an amazing place, beautifully linear. And Sandra Dodd&#39;s site <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a> is just a labryinth of interconnected pages and ideas, with golden cords to help you find your way through all the while.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;Currently I&#39;m looking at The Unschooling Handbook. I find this style to be much freer than the way I was taught.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is likely to be much freer than the way any of us were taught. Unschooling isn&#39;t a teaching method, though. It is an approach to education that is about putting aside teaching so that learning can occur. Teaching makes a presumption of a student and an instructor. Unschooling starts with the notion that everyone is a learner and that every situation offers its own learning experience, depending on how you approach it, or how you walk away from it. <br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;I am looking for ways to teach my children by learning about who they are. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would start by putting away the notion of teaching your children. Even when there are things they are learning from you, it is much more helpful to think of yourself as their partner than as their instructor. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/wordswords\">http://sandradodd.com/wordswords</a> is an essay on why using the word teach may be a stumbling block in your understanding of unschooling. What follows is a quote from that essay:<br/>\n<br/>\n              If I want to teach someone how to use quotation marks, I can talk, show them, make jokes, draw stick figures with speech-balloons, and I could maybe sing songs about it. So IF the person who&#39;s in the room &quot;being taught&quot; is thinking about how to file down that one piece of a machine gun that can turn a legal semi-automatic into an illegal automatic, and how to hide that part really well, disguised as something altogether different, what am I doing? <br/>\n<br/>\n              I&#39;m talking, writing, drawing, dancing, and singing. But I&#39;m not teaching. I&#39;m reviewing for myself something I already know. I&#39;m just performing a play of sorts, without any audience. I&#39;m playing with myself. I&#39;m ...well, you know. <br/>\n<br/>\n              So if I&#39;m reading a magazine about machine guns and someone comes and says, &quot;How do I punctuate a quote within a quote?&quot; I can show them. If they don&#39;t totally understand, I can draw pictures or give other examples. When I perceive that they have learned the thing they wanted to learn, I should shush up and go back to my magazine, because the action is completed. .<br/>\n<br/>\n              They learned. I helped them learn. I was &quot;the teacher&quot; but I didn&#39;t do the work that resulted in learning. The learner did that in his own head. I could put ideas in the air, but only he could hear and process and ask more questions. Without his active work, no teaching can possibly take place. <br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;I do not make homemade bread, nor do I have an organic garden. And I&#39;ve occasionally thrown plastic in the garbage. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    There are many people out there who make homemade bread and garden organically and have small holdings with free range chickens and live in a home they built that runs on solar power who, also, happily bid their children farewell ever morning and greet them with a smile every afternoon when they return from school. The two things are not entertwined. And it has been my experience that many of those people who are rigorous about how their food is raised are much more likely to limit their own children&#39;s choice of food. <br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot; I have my defenses up because I&#39;ve &quot;bumped into&quot; a few unschoolers who have strong opinions about their approach to teaching as though any other style is of Satan!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    It is easy to be passionate about unschooling. And it is easy for that passion to come across as intolerance. When you have chosen to allow your children to craft their own lives with your help and to support them in whatever interests them, it is hard to watch other people squash their children into whatever box they feel is the best and most appropriate box to view the rest of the world from. There is a real sense that childhood is short and that every day that you spend traditionally parenting is a day that you&#39;ve spent not working to create the best relationship possible with your child. And, I suppose, with that in mind, prostelytizing might become a part of an unschoolers approach to the world. <br/>\n<br/>\n     &quot;I&#39;m hoping someone here has a definition of what unschooling is&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    My favorite definition of unschooling comes from here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/unschooling/unschoolingphilosophy.html\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/unschooling/unschoolingphilosophy.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;The goal of unschooling is not education. It is to help a child be who she is and blossom into who she will become. Learning happens as a side effect.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.wayforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle Leifur Reid","from":"&quot;Michelle Leifur Reid&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling?

If you don&#39;t want to read<br/>\n&quot;another book&quot; look through the webpages of Sandra Dodd and our own<br/>\nJoyce as well as the archives here.  Or just sit back and read as the<br/>\nmessages come through ( we tend to repeat things often enough) :-)<br/>\nYou will need to deschool yourself, but hopefully you won&#39;t have to<br/>\ndeschool your kids (too much).  As for others, I think we are all<br/>\npassionate about the way in which we are raising our children.  I also<br/>\ndon&#39;t think that you can &quot;half unschool&quot; children.  Either you are<br/>\nunschooling or  you are doing something else (self-directed studies<br/>\nperhaps).  Unschooling is so much more than just how we help our<br/>\nchildren gain information.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m hoping someone here has a definition of what unschooling is as well as how to fill out<br/>\n&gt; the proper paperwork for the school district, if your not sitting down teaching geometry???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, we would only be &quot;sitting down teaching geometry&quot; if our child<br/>\nasked to learn geometry.  Geometry can be learned from all kinds of<br/>\nways other than sitting at a table with work books.  Sewing, quilting,<br/>\nbuilding gardens, making gingerbread houses, making a tree house,<br/>\nbuilding a kite, getting recycling into a box, sorting the pantry, etc<br/>\netc etc.  Unschooling (at least for us) is living our lives fully and<br/>\nfollowing our interests while trusting that we will learn the things<br/>\nthat we need to learn as we have need for them.  There is more to it<br/>\nthan that, but that is my definition in a nutshell.  Others will have<br/>\nbroader or narrower or different definitions and what they include or<br/>\nexclude in their definitions.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle - who owns no denim apron but is making a 10th century Viking<br/>\napron with lots of triangles today</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287618285,"authorName":"John & Karen Buxcel","from":"&quot;John & Karen Buxcel&quot; &lt;thewildtribe@...&gt;","profile":"blackhillsdoula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling?
