Are there no limit setting in unschooling? ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nSure there are. <br/>\nEvery family decides that for themselves. What we discuss here are<br/>\nways to meet the underlying needs of a child, without controlling<br/>\ntheir choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust now I had a real-life limit come up. We just installed a lovely<br/>\nMayan handwoven hammock swing here in the basement. Jalen was climbing<br/>\nup onto the wooden bar (that the hammock hangs from) and hanging<br/>\nupside down and doing other stunts. I stopped him. It&#39;s right over<br/>\nconcrete and it&#39;s about 6 feet off the floor! I&#39;m not really willing<br/>\nto trust his 6y.o. flipping ability enough to find out if his head<br/>\nwill crack when it hits concrete.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, after explaining why I wasn&#39;t ok with the activity, I offered a<br/>\nfew other choices......<br/>\n~buy a special bar just for flipping from, with a mat under it<br/>\n~buy a mat for under the chair, for flipping time<br/>\n~put a bar outside over soft ground (dh&#39;s idea)<br/>\n~or???  I asked if he had any ideas for making it safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t care anymore. He had moved on to other activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, dh and I now know he will want to hang and flip from the bar. We<br/>\ncan meet the underlying need and keep him safe (and keep me from<br/>\nhaving a heart attack at the same time;) all at once. Rather than<br/>\nlimiting him, we can expand his world. Now he&#39;ll have a hammock swing<br/>\nto be snugged up in AND a bar for hanging from. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe limit is only in the moment....it&#39;s a lot easier to meet needs,<br/>\nthan to constantly try to stop someone from doing what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Robyn/Robin","postDate":"1179274063","msgId":23658,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOTY1NjU1QzZDNjY3Qy03M0MtM0UwNEBGV00tRDMwLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4ODQzMy41NTQ2MC5xbUB3ZWI1MzgwNy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":23657,"nextInTopic":23659,"prevInTime":23657,"nextInTime":23659,"topicId":521,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
