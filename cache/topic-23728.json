They&#39;re born perfectly suited to being individuals. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I thought there was a scene in a movie that might disturb Dylan I&#39;d just<br/>\ntell him what I thought.   He (in every case, if I remember right) decided<br/>\nto watch the movie anyway.   I remember at the end of one of the Godzilla<br/>\nmovies, (The one where he&#39;s melting in the volcano) Dylan turned the TV off<br/>\nand said &quot;I&#39;m never watching THAT again.&quot;   When we talked about it he said<br/>\nhe felt sad for Godzilla and they shouldn&#39;t have ended the movie that way.<br/>\nWe made up different endings.   At first they were all about Godzilla<br/>\nstomping the guys who tricked him into the volcano but our made up endings<br/>\ngradually got sillier.  After some days he decided to watch the movie again <br/>\nand we talked about the special<br/>\neffects of Godzilla melting.   He now fondly recalls his viewing of that<br/>\nmovie, all these years later.  We still love to watch those old Godzilla<br/>\nmovies together. &lt;g&gt;  We throw popcorn at the bad guys (and the monsters are<br/>\nnever the bad guys&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n***I do agree with Cameron in that things can influence<br/>\nsome people.  We don&#39;t know for sure what will or won&#39;t influence our<br/>\nkids. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nHumans are being influenced all the time by everything around them.  People<br/>\nwere being influenced before TV was ever invented.&lt;g&gt;  Our kids will be<br/>\ninfluenced by family members, neighbors, friends, smells, tastes, textures,<br/>\ntemperatures, grass, music, bees, water, dreams, cars, sculptures,<br/>\nmountains, paintings, dirt...   We can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t try to be the only<br/>\ninfluence on our kids.   All people are not the same,  all of us evolve as<br/>\nwe grow and all of our growth and evolution comes from our experience and<br/>\nenvironment.  The more we experience (safely, with the help of people who<br/>\nlove us) the more intelligent and capable we become.  That&#39;s how it should<br/>\nbe.   Our kids are not destined to become some fresher version of ourselves.<br/>\nThey are themselves and we need to let them be themselves.  That brain is<br/>\nnot ours. &lt;g&gt; (dang it anyway, I could use a fresh brain.  HEY, that may be <br/>\nwhy I love zombie movies!)<br/>\n<br/>\n***We can hope we have raised them to know right from wrong, and<br/>\nwhat is pretend humor on tv and what is real.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be more than a hope.  What&#39;s that quote?  &quot;If you can&#39;t be a good<br/>\nexample then you&#39;ll just have to be a horrible warning.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nWe can model goodness, kindness, honesty.  We can model thoughtful decision<br/>\nmaking and respect for others.  We can and will influence our kids.  We<br/>\ncan&#39;t help but influence our kids!  We just can&#39;t expect to be the *only*<br/>\ninfluence.  That wouldn&#39;t be good or natural or healthy.   But we are the <br/>\nsteady influence.  We are the continuous feed<br/>\nfrom birth and there&#39;s a lot of power in that.  We need to be more dedicated<br/>\nto being a helpful guide for our child&#39;s individual journey than we are<br/>\ndedicated to trying to make them just like us.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I realize Cameron&#39;s son is older but in a way from reading your posts<br/>\nCameron I would say he is asking you for limits even though he says he<br/>\nis not. It&#39;s just the feeling I get for what its worth. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s a mistake to let the voice of our unfounded fears overpower the<br/>\nvoice of our children.<br/>\n<br/>\n***...if he is looking for limits because as someone pointed out he doesn&#39;t<br/>\ntrust<br/>\nhimself that is not a bad thing, it&#39;s just how he feels at this point<br/>\nin his life. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is a bad thing.  We all have doubts and rely on others for help<br/>\nor reassurance from time to time.  But a healthy survival depends on our<br/>\nbeing able to make good decisions.  If we can&#39;t trust ourselves we can&#39;t<br/>\nmake good decisions.    Kids who don&#39;t have confidence in themselves are<br/>\nmuch more likely to be at risk of deception by others.   It&#39;s not just a bad<br/>\nthing, it&#39;s dangerous.   If a child of thirteen is always depending on<br/>\nadults to make up his mind he&#39;s at risk.   Not all adults will have his best<br/>\ninterest at heart.   We only become capable and confident when we know and<br/>\ntrust ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n ***maybe he will begin to trust himself as the unschooling<br/>\nlife unfolds.......I don&#39;t know.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know.  People don&#39;t learn to trust themselves until and unless they<br/>\nhave a lot of experience making their own decisions.   Kids will make poor<br/>\nchoices.  We all do.  But making some questionable choices doesn&#39;t mean we<br/>\nshould be able to or can&#39;t continue to make choices.  And parents need to be<br/>\naware of the difference between a poor choice and a choice the parent just<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t agree with.  One is not necessarily the other. &lt;g&gt;  As difficult as<br/>\nit has been for me to accept, I am not always right. &lt;bwg&gt;  We can help our<br/>\nkids.  We can ask questions.  We can express our concerns and even say &quot;I<br/>\nthink that&#39;s a bad idea and here&#39;s why.&quot;  But that doesn&#39;t mean our kids<br/>\nhave to agree with us, and it doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re right.   Our kids<br/>\ndefinitely need our thoughtful guidance.   They also really need to make<br/>\ntheir own choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling can&#39;t work in a home where kids aren&#39;t trusted.  It just won&#39;t<br/>\nhappen.   Learning takes exploration and in order to explore a person needs<br/>\nto be free.  Unschooling parents need to be brave and let their kids be<br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n***my question is why is it not truly unschooling if we help<br/>\nour kids by setting limits? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nControlling other people is counter productive.  First, it&#39;s hard.  It<br/>\nalmost never works the way we wish it would.  Once you set a limit how do<br/>\nyou enforce it?  You either have to trust the kid won&#39;t exceed the limit or<br/>\nyou have to set in place some other kinds of limits to ensure the first one<br/>\nis maintained.  If you could trust him, why the limit?   It&#39;s complicated.<br/>\nAnd control is an illusion.  We might stop our kids from doing something<br/>\nwhen we&#39;re around but what about when we&#39;re not around?  What about when<br/>\nwe&#39;re asleep?  When they go to a friend&#39;s house?  When we go to the store<br/>\nand they stay home?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling only works when people are free to explore.  That doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\n&quot;left to their own devices&quot; as talk show hosts are fond of saying.&lt;g&gt;  Our<br/>\nkids shouldn&#39;t be ignored or neglected or scooted out the door with a broom<br/>\nso we can clean house.    We should be involved in their life in fun and <br/>\nhelpful ways as much as they want us.<br/>\n<br/>\nLimits are things people talk about a lot but don&#39;t think about too much.<br/>\nWe hear from our parents about our limits and when we&#39;re grown we hear about<br/>\nhow kids need limits and when our own kids come along we&#39;re fairly itching<br/>\nto set some limits because that&#39;s what parents do.  We start our life with<br/>\nour children believing they&#39;re always on the verge of doing something<br/>\nthey&#39;re not supposed to do so we are ever on the look out for ways to stop<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unschooling parents don&#39;t think of limits as things that &quot;help&quot;<br/>\nchildren.  Unschoolers think *help* helps a child. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nUnschooling parents believe their kids are doing exactly what they&#39;re<br/>\nsupposed to do.  Exploring the world where they will spend their whole<br/>\nlives.  Instead of looking for reasons they should be limited in their<br/>\nexplorations we look for ways to help them explore safely and happily.<br/>\nWe&#39;re not standing in their way.  We&#39;re not the roadblock between our kid<br/>\nand where our kid wants to go.  We&#39;re the tour guide, helping him go just as<br/>\nfar as *he* wants.  Its a big world.  We&#39;re not going to be the biggest part<br/>\nof our kid&#39;s lives for very long.  The very best thing we can do for them is<br/>\nto help them come to know their world and be confident in it.  We can&#39;t do<br/>\nthat by setting up unnatural boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: More questions on limits......","postDate":"1179404598","msgId":23761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY0OUEyOEYwLTY1NUQtNEEwNC05OEQxLUVEMUJGMDI1RUQ3NUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDJGMUExNzBBLUQ5NjUtNEI0OC04QTdELThGOUI1MTE4MzEwNUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDcwNTE2LjE5NTEzNC44MDguMjI2NTc0M0B3ZWJtYWlsMDcubGF4LnVudGQuY29tPiA8MkYxQTE3MEEtRDk2NS00QjQ4LThBN0QtOEY5QjUxMTgzMTA1QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":23744,"nextInTopic":23772,"prevInTime":23760,"nextInTime":23762,"topicId":23728,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The advice is  <br/>\nof the form &quot;When child does x, you do y.&quot; With conventional  <br/>\nparenting it doesn&#39;t make any difference why the child is reacting in  <br/>\nthat way. The parent&#39;s job is to stop the behavior. For example, if a  <br/>\n7 yo wants to watch an R rated horror movie conventional parenting  <br/>\nsays no. So hypotheticals can work to explain conventional parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMindful parenting is proactive. It focuses on the child&#39;s needs and  <br/>\nthose aren&#39;t present in a hypothetical. If a 7 yo wanted to watch an  <br/>\nR rated horror movie there&#39;s a whole world of motivations behind it  <br/>\nwell beyond &quot;I want to.&quot; The advice would help the parent focus on  <br/>\nwhat the child really wants. Maybe they saw the cover and think it&#39;s  <br/>\nabout something it isn&#39;t. Maybe a friend saw it and described a funny  <br/>\nscene. Maybe it&#39;s because big brother is watching it and he wants to  <br/>\nbe with his brother. Maybe it&#39;s because he understands what it&#39;s  <br/>\nabout and really wants to see it -- in which case we&#39;d suggest  <br/>\nstrategies to help the child see it comfortably and have power over  <br/>\nthe movie (free to stop at any point, fast forward, watch in the  <br/>\nmorning and so on.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of the above makes sense in a hypothetical. Hypothetical  <br/>\nchildren can be what if&#39;d into situations that fit the solution the  <br/>\nparent wants to hear, for instance, &quot;What if the 7 yo just wanted to  <br/>\nwatch period?&quot; Just because it&#39;s plausible, doesn&#39;t mean there are  <br/>\nreal children who behave that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal kids don&#39;t &quot;just want to.&quot; There&#39;s a whole family dynamic,  <br/>\npersonality, history, unmet needs and so forth behind what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe what&#39;s confusing you is you&#39;re taking advice tailored to one  <br/>\nperson&#39;s family and assuming it&#39;s like conventional parenting: if a 5  <br/>\nyo wants to watch the news, let them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince she had already built the foundation that there was a lot of  <br/>\ndiscussion in her family, that important aspect was there. The child  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be watching without parent support. It was clear either they  <br/>\nwould be there with him to explain things or he knew he could come to  <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nMindful parenting isn&#39;t cookie cutter advice. Parents shouldn&#39;t be  <br/>\nparking their 5 yos in front of the 6 o&#39;clock news! ;-) But if a  <br/>\nchild wants to watch the news because they&#39;ve had experience with it  <br/>\nand has a relationship of support then his interests should be  <br/>\nsupported.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: hypotheticals WAS:  More questions on limits......","postDate":"1179371385","msgId":23744,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOTY2NDdGNDZGNkQ0Ni0xMEU4LTgxQUZATUJMSy1NMDguc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDcwNTE2LjE5NTEzNC44MDguMjI2NTc0M0B3ZWJtYWlsMDcubGF4LnVudGQuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDcwNTE2LjE5NTEzNC44MDguMjI2NTc0M0B3ZWJtYWlsMDcubGF4LnVudGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23742,"nextInTopic":23761,"prevInTime":23743,"nextInTime":23745,"topicId":23728,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And if he is<br/>\nlooking for limits because as someone pointed out he doesn&#39;t trust<br/>\nhimself that is not a bad thing, it&#39;s just how he feels at this point<br/>\nin his life. maybe he will begin to trust himself as the unschooling<br/>\nlife unfolds.......I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the more he&#39;s restricted the LESS he will trust himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool does that to children every day.
