It is ok, if one child likes school, and does well with <br/>\nit, and the other one doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just pulled my kids out of public school, at the end of last year <br/>\n(they were in 3rd and 4th grade).  Since having them out, they are <br/>\nlearning what it is really like to live life, and enjoy the things <br/>\nthey like.   There are no more tests, no more spelling, and no more <br/>\nlearning about uninteresting things.  Now they learn at their own <br/>\npace, and are more relaxed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter was in school (she&#39;s 9), she was labeled with &quot;she <br/>\nstruggles with math and always will.&quot;, and now that I have her home, <br/>\nshe is more at ease with adding and subtracting stuff, and has done <br/>\nmuch better with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son was in school (he&#39;s 11) he wasn&#39;t a very good speller, <br/>\nand would add letters in the words, even though they didn&#39;t belong <br/>\nin it.  He would get very upset, and frustrated.  Now he is much <br/>\nbetter at spelling, than he ever was in public school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are still deschooling, and telling me different things about <br/>\nthe horrors of public school.  We are healing together, for the <br/>\nthings we all had to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is so much better on the other side.  It may be video games, <br/>\nand computer, and shopping and movies, but they still learn, and <br/>\nthey are having more fun now, then they did in public school.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime to let go, bring your son home, and spread your wings.  <br/>\nUnschooling is great, and I am really enjoying getting to know my <br/>\nkids again.  Take care, and best of luck to you and your son.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Vanessa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jenjon1964&quot; <br/>\n&lt;amparo0914@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi everybody,<br/>\n&gt;  You are all <br/>\n&gt; such nice ladies I was hoping for some advice from all of you.
