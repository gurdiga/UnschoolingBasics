Not technically an unschooling issue if you describe<br/>\nunschooling as not doing school, but an unschooling issue if you describe<br/>\nunschooling as a life philosophy.    A human rights issue, I guess.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister in law is here with her kids.  We were all up at my mom in<br/>\nlaw&#39;s house, cooking, eating, visiting and I started to do the dishes.  <br/>\nDylan went out to the picnic table to collect plates and glasses people<br/>\nwere finished with.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sil came in and said to her middle daughter &quot;you&#39;re just sitting there<br/>\nletting her do the dishes?&quot; in a tone that was so snotty and<br/>\ndisrespectful.  Lillie said she thought we&#39;d probably talked about it and<br/>\nalready worked it out and her mom said &quot;No adult in this house should<br/>\nhave to do dishes when there are three teen aged girls here.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy stomach hurt.  Dylan was SO offended he got up and went outside.  I<br/>\ntold Lillie I was sorry my actions resulted in her being yelled at and<br/>\ntold her I was happy to do the dishes, that I liked the hot water and it<br/>\nmade my hands feel good.   I told my sil if she was being harsh on her<br/>\nkids to impress me it was failing miserably and I&#39;d rather see everyone<br/>\nhappy even if I ended up doing every dish from now until eternity.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people talk like that to their kids it&#39;s not parenting.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow quite what to call it, but if we keep calling the abuse of kids by<br/>\ntheir parents &quot;parenting&quot; we&#39;re not going to get anywhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf my sister in law had been talking to/about the neighbor kids who<br/>\nhappen to be black and had said &quot;No white person in this house should<br/>\nhave to do dishes when there are three black girls here&quot;   Everyone would<br/>\nhave exploded in outrage.   If a man had said &quot;No man in this house<br/>\nshould have to do dishes when there are women here.&quot;  I can&#39;t think of<br/>\nanyone who&#39;d stay silent.   Really, I&#39;m asking now, is there anyone on<br/>\nthis list who wouldn&#39;t have made a judgement about that kind of behavior?<br/>\n Would we spend a minute debating whether it was right to judge? <br/>\n<br/>\nOur society lets this kind of discrimination, disrespect, abuse of kids<br/>\ngo on and on because we tell ourselves we shouldn&#39;t be judgmental about<br/>\nthe way others parent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBullshit.   <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople like this are hurting their kids as surely as if they were hitting<br/>\nthem.  Sickeningly enough, even if she&#39;d hit her daughter then (she does,<br/>\nbut she didn&#39;t then) no one in the family (except Dylan and I ) would<br/>\nhave said anything about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe seem to still be pretty comfortable letting adults get away with<br/>\ndiscrimination against children and I wonder why.   How many of us on<br/>\nthis list could witness a woman being abusive to her elderly mother and<br/>\nnot make a judgement call about whether it&#39;s right or wrong?   How many<br/>\nof us could watch a man treat his wife this way and not make a judgement<br/>\nabout it? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the only way things will start to change for children on a larger<br/>\nscale than just our little unschooling lists, is if we are brave enough<br/>\nto speak up in defense of kids who are being treated like crap by their<br/>\nparents.  Maybe even if we do we won&#39;t be able to make much difference, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know, but I know I don&#39;t want to look into my son&#39;s eyes and tell<br/>\nhim I was too worried about being politically correct to try.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1742,"nextTopicId":1754}}
