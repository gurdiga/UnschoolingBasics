But I think Maisha&#39;s family <br/>\nis kind of like ours right now, where we are sliding on the spectrum <br/>\nof unschooling. If we jumped straight to where you&#39;re at, there would <br/>\nbe problems. My children DO still choose to eat when they see someone <br/>\neat, basically because they are worried about things being fair <br/>\n(that&#39;s mostly age and experience I think, in addition to the fact if <br/>\nyou have nine people in your household, if two or three someones ate <br/>\nall they wanted of something, it&#39;s very possible that none would be <br/>\nleft for the next seven or eight persons). If so-n-so gets a candy <br/>\nbar, it doesn&#39;t matter what their internal state is, THEY want a <br/>\ncandy bar. So I would say that body signals right now are not the <br/>\nbest way to judge hunger.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not really taking a choice away, we&#39;re just moving towards <br/>\nchoice.

None of us can afford to buy  <br/>\nabsolutely everything our family might wish for.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Food limits&quot; refers to conventional parenting methods of the parent  <br/>\ndeciding exactly what food will be purchased, what will be served,  <br/>\nwhen it will be served, and how much a child must eat, often whether  <br/>\nthey like it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot having such limits doesn&#39;t mean we magically have the ability to  <br/>\nbuy everything everybody wants, all the time. Real life requires  <br/>\nliving within budget constraints.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever - the question is do the kids have a say-so in how much of  <br/>\nthe family budget goes toward food? That $150 per month - is that  <br/>\nsomething everybody understands and agrees with or would they like to  <br/>\ntry to find some way to give up something else and have a little more  <br/>\nmoney for food? In other words, with such a limited budget, we&#39;d  <br/>\nprobably make it a family decision. Another possibility would be to  <br/>\ngive each kid a small amount of that money to decide how to spend -  <br/>\nin other words, find ways to let them help with the decision making,  <br/>\neven though it is within a constraint. When I get ready to go  <br/>\nshopping, I ask everybody - &quot;Anybody want to put something on my  <br/>\nlist?&quot; They say things like broccoli, bananas, milk, cucumbers,  <br/>\nspecific cereals, popcorn -- they almost never say ice cream or cake  <br/>\nor cookies. Just once in a while does anybody straight out ask for  <br/>\nsomething like a box of Oreos - if they do, I make an effort to get  <br/>\nit. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re doing something similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the food is home and in the kitchen, they can choose what and  <br/>\nwhen to eat (except if something was special for one person, I  <br/>\nsometimes put someone&#39;s name on it OR if I have plans to cook with  <br/>\nsomething, I might tell people not to eat it). If they eat all the  <br/>\nice cream the first day after shopping - that&#39;s okay.  But if I see  <br/>\none person eating a whole lot of something, I&#39;d probably remind them  <br/>\nto make sure they consider others who might want it. Doesn&#39;t happen  <br/>\ntoo often - but occasionally somebody eats up something that someone  <br/>\nelse was looking forward to - when it does happen, I just make sure  <br/>\nto get that person some of it the next time I shop and make sure that  <br/>\nthis time they get some of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 10, 2006, at 12:56 PM, drusila00 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  I am not trying to get anyone to eat less food but I do try to make<br/>\n&gt; my son aware that he has choices when it comes to food consumption.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I buy 150.00 worth of food per month.<br/>\n&gt; it is our entire food budget.<br/>\n&gt;  I strech it as far as I can, I use cupons, sales and discount<br/>\n&gt; grocerys.

It&#39;s given the  <br/>\nkids alot to think about, we personally don&#39;t limit to just one  <br/>\nserving, but mindful eating is as important as mindful parenting.<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 10, 2006, at 7:52 AM, Ren Allen wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s the word &quot;allow&quot; again.

And it&#39;s interesting to me that you <br/>\nmention unhealthy choices in the future: giving kids zero chance to <br/>\npractice making choices now in my opinion generally leads to an <br/>\nimpaired ability (to varying degrees) to make good choices in the <br/>\nfuture.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to be perfectly clear: people who radically unschool when it comes <br/>\nto food don&#39;t offer their kids chips and cookies constantly, or have <br/>\nonly those items in the house. They simply aren&#39;t forbidden.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t speak for all other unschoolers, but we know all about fruits <br/>\nand vegetables! We live on a farm and grow our own lettuce, radishes, <br/>\nonions, tomatoes, peppers, watermelon, pumpkins, corn, beans, okra, <br/>\ncucumbers, turnips, and probably a dozen other items. We also have wild <br/>\nblackberries on our property. So be careful what assumptions you make <br/>\nabout other people&#39;s families if you don&#39;t have the whole picture!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter eats a lot of different foods (in rotation, and separately, <br/>\ni.e. she&#39;ll eat cereal and fruit, but not cereal with fruit on it) and <br/>\nshe even knows a lot about foods that she chooses not to eat. She will <br/>\nhelp me cook stuff all the time that she knows is daddy&#39;s favorite but <br/>\nshe won&#39;t want any because for example it&#39;s got mushrooms in it. But <br/>\nstill she likes to help. Granted she won&#39;t eat most of the stuff we <br/>\ngrow, but her food choices are changing and evolving all the time <br/>\naccording to her own tastes and what her own body needs at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast month&#39;s favorite falls by the wayside and she tries something new <br/>\nand adds it to the menu of what is acceptable to her. Then it changes <br/>\nagain. She used to eat only plain bread. No toasting, no spreads of any <br/>\nkind. Now she eats toast with butter or french toast but not plain <br/>\nbread. She took about a year off from eating eggs other than in french <br/>\ntoast and now she asks for scrambled eggs often. I used to be <br/>\npositively alarmed at how many pistachios she would eat. I haven&#39;t seen <br/>\none pass her lips in 6 months. But now she suddenly likes to lick <br/>\npeanut butter off a spoon. It&#39;s very interesting to me that she will <br/>\neat bologna and cheese but not a bologna and cheese sandwich. She has <br/>\nher reasons I guess!<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now as far as fruits and veggies go she loves carrots, apples, <br/>\nblueberries, and peas. My younger daughter loves squash, peaches, <br/>\navocadoes, sweet potatoes, and bananas. My older daughter wouldn&#39;t eat <br/>\nany of those things if her life depended on it, lol. And that&#39;s fine. I <br/>\nfeel like a surefire way to make her stop liking peas is to withhold <br/>\npopsicles or cookies until she eats all of her peas (not saying you do <br/>\nthis, just saying that many many people do, and it&#39;s a bad idea in my <br/>\nopinion).<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t make peas the enemy! Eat popsicles in the bath! Worried about how <br/>\nmany cookies/brownies your kids are eating? Make a healthy version that <br/>\nyou can feel good about saying yes to at any time of the day. Model <br/>\nhealthy eating. Leave bowls of fruit and trays of veggies and dip out <br/>\nfor them. There was a study that people are something like 30-40% more <br/>\nlikely to eat fruit if it&#39;s washed and displayed in plain sight than <br/>\nstored somewhere hidden. And mini carrots with ranch dressing was more <br/>\npopular with the kids (ages 3-14) at my DD&#39;s 3rd birthday party than <br/>\nthe brownies. Color me shocked, lol. I remember hovering by the food <br/>\ntable at birthday parties when I was little and scarfing M & Ms and <br/>\ncupcakes like there was no tomorrow. Because there WAS no tomorrow for <br/>\nsweets for me -- until the next party.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know this thread has inspired me to post some pictures of my kids <br/>\nin the photos section. Might take a while as I&#39;m on dialup (ugh!) but <br/>\nit&#39;s important to me that people reading this SEE how beautifully <br/>\nhealthy they are on a diet of their own choosing.

So I would say that body signals right now are not the  <br/>\nbest way to judge hunger.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not really taking a choice away, we&#39;re just moving towards  <br/>\nchoice. It&#39;s getting better all the time (heehee, one of my favorite  <br/>\nsongs). If one of my kids had ever said they were starving, of course  <br/>\nI would offer them some choices. If someone said they were a little  <br/>\nsnacky and just wanting to taste something, then I might say &quot;Well,  <br/>\ndinner is in 15 minutes, could you wait til then?&quot; We don&#39;t  <br/>\nnecessarily even eat the same thing at dinner, but if my ten yo is  <br/>\njust a little hungry, I think he could talk to me for fifteen minutes  <br/>\nand then eat it with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be different a little for us because i do leave a snack tray  <br/>\nout all day...and that&#39;s helped a lot with the kids being able to  <br/>\nlearn themselves better.
