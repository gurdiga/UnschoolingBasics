I put it up on the wall and have my kids make me a mural. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  As far as other kids to play with .....you say he is already in dance and art ? that should help some. Here there a local community theatre group? would that intrest him?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  What about your work? I know you work from home but are there set hours you have to go by? Would it be possible to do some work early and some of the work later in the eve ? then you could have a chunk of time in the middle of the afternoon to not just supervise but to go get sticks, draw picks in the sand, fly kites , laugh and roll in the mud with him <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNew Yahoo!
