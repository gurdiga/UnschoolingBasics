I used to be a <br/>\nvery social, chatty child until I started school. Once school came along and <br/>\nchastized me for being chatty and social during class, I squashed that <br/>\nbehavior. My mother, who had agoraphobia and was extremely, painfully shy <br/>\nwith just about everyone outside of our family, felt that she would be <br/>\nsaving me from a world of hurt and awkwardness if she could just bring out <br/>\nthat social child again. However, if she had only known about unschooling <br/>\n(or homeschooling, at least), it might have worked.

I still hated it.<br/>\n<br/>\nResult today? I still hate social activities. I could stay home every single <br/>\nday and sit and read or get on the computer or garden, etc. and never see <br/>\nanother person besides my husband and son all day and be super duper happy <br/>\nabout it. My son, however, is a butterfly who wants to go places and see <br/>\nkids, etc., so I pull it out of myself to go somewhere once a day. My <br/>\nhusband is also a very social person and has to have people over for dinner <br/>\nor small parties fairly frequently, so I pull it out of myself for him, too. <br/>\nWe do have lots of &quot;down time&quot;, though, too, for MY sanity.

I have 3 boys ages almost 14, 16 and <br/>\n18. My 18 year old has always been shy but has a strong desire to <br/>\nfigure out how to be social. My 16 yo has never been shy but isn&#39;t a <br/>\nsuper duper outgoing type either. My youngest has always been shy <br/>\nand has NO desire to get to know anyone else unless of course they <br/>\ncome to him and are interested in things he is interested in, like <br/>\nonline games. I used to worry about my boys because they never <br/>\nseemed to want to go out in our neighborhood to find friends to hang <br/>\nout with. I finally realized that they had always had each other to <br/>\nplay with and even though they sometimes get tired of each other and <br/>\nact like they would rather be around anyone else in the world than <br/>\ntheir brothers, they really were just best friends. Another thing <br/>\nabout them that I realized is that they don&#39;t necessarily NEED to be <br/>\naround a LOT of other kids. They are perfectly happy to have someone <br/>\nthey enjoy being with over on occasion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest one decided to go to high school because he felt like he <br/>\nwanted to be around more kids his age. He did make a few friends <br/>\nthat he has hung out with on occasion but what he has enjoyed the <br/>\nmost was going to work this last year at a web design company where <br/>\nall of the people he works with are WAY older than he is, but he has <br/>\nsomething in common with them, computers!<br/>\n<br/>\nI always considered myself shy as a child and don&#39;t consider myself <br/>\nparticularly outgoing now but I have a LOT of friends. Not friends <br/>\nthat I see all the time but when we see each other it is SO great to <br/>\nbe with them!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess my point is, sometimes we worry about our kids more than <br/>\nwe need to. Maybe you kids don&#39;t need to have more socialization. If <br/>\nthey are asking for time around other kids, invite someone over. <br/>\nFind a way to help that child socialize whether it benefits all 4 of <br/>\nthem or just the one. He may be the only one that needs it right <br/>\nnow. I also discovered that over the years they didn&#39;t each have a <br/>\nfriend their age that they could invite over so we just invited a <br/>\nfriend or two no matter what age they were and they just all hung <br/>\nout together. That&#39;s one of the beauties of unschooling. Age doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter if they have similar interests! But, if they aren&#39;t asking <br/>\nfor socialization, then maybe they have enough at home!<br/>\n<br/>\nRose<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Janice&quot; &lt;wolverton@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Everyone, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My name is Janice and I am the wife of Glen, and the mother of 4 <br/>\n&gt; boys: Paul- 14.5, Shawn-12, Eric-9, Collin-8(in 2 wks), and Joshua-<br/>\n </span></blockquote>6<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (in 2 wks).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We recently attended the Peabody Unschooling Conference to try to <br/>\n&gt; help us decide whether or not the unschooling life was really what <br/>\n&gt; we were after or not.

I wanted to address this concern of yours <br/>\nwith a question.  If you decide against unschooling and choose <br/>\ntraditional homeschooling, how would that help your boys become more <br/>\nsocial?  What kind of homeschooling have you been doing?  Forgive <br/>\nthis assumption, but if it was working well for you, I don&#39;t think <br/>\nyou&#39;d be looking into unschooling, right?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is very introverted as well.  We&#39;ve been homeschooling over 4 <br/>\nyears and no matter what type of homeschooling we&#39;ve tried, his <br/>\npersonality hasn&#39;t changed.  However, since our family lifestyle has <br/>\nmoved into radical unschooling, he&#39;s become a happier little boy.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s slowly opening up, trusting us more because he is learning that <br/>\nwe won&#39;t force him to do things he really doesn&#39;t want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime to get ready for dinner.  Glad to see you here and asking <br/>\nquestions.  The people on this list are so great.  I wish I could <br/>\nattend an unschooling conference!  It&#39;s just not going to work out <br/>\nthis year though.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Pampered Chef Michelle","from":"&quot;Pampered Chef Michelle&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Intro and Peabody conference and questions","postDate":"1149019209","msgId":13801,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA1MzAxMzAwaDM3OGFkODA0cmIzZmM3MzgwYzgyNTZkNWZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGU1aG5jOStzb2tpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU1aG5jOStzb2tpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13799,"nextInTopic":13802,"prevInTime":13800,"nextInTime":13802,"topicId":13799,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Scared to do something new? or truly just like better<br/>\nbeing by themselves?  What do you do now?  It seems like with their ages<br/>\nthat they have created their own social structure.  That&#39;s ok if it brings<br/>\njoy in their lives.  If pushing them out the door to force them to be social<br/>\nis going to bring fear or distrust then I would be hesitant to tell you to<br/>\njust &quot;go for it&quot; and find ways to bring socialism in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nTell us a bit about what a day in your family life is like.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle - momentarily bringing her head up from a book<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":71209375,"authorName":"Janice","from":"&quot;Janice&quot; &lt;wolverton@...&gt;","profile":"ljmwhinmass","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Intro and Peabody conference and questions","postDate":"1149001929","msgId":13799,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU1aG5jOStzb2tpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13801,"prevInTime":13798,"nextInTime":13800,"topicId":13799,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Everyone, My name is Janice and I am the wife of Glen, and the mother of 4 boys: Paul- 14.5, Shawn-12, Eric-9, Collin-8(in 2 wks), and Joshua-6 (in 2 wks).

The conference made reference to this web <br/>\ngroup, so here I am.  We have been homeschooling for 5 years now and <br/>\nthis past year have tentatively been trying out the unschooling <br/>\nlifestyle.  I have known about unschooling since the start of our <br/>\nhomeschooling journey and have always been intrigued by it, but was <br/>\nsomewhat hesitant to try it.  All of my children are VERY <br/>\nintroverted.  They would prefer to never leave the confines of our <br/>\nhome for any reason, and this makes me somewhat shy of unschooling.  <br/>\nThey have NO friends whatsoever.  Even at the conference, they spent <br/>\nas much time as they possibly could hiding in our hotel room.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould someone please convince me that this will work for our family?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, my husband is still on the fence about even traditional <br/>\nhomeschooling methods and this makes him even more nervous.  He has <br/>\nagreed to &quot;go with the flow&quot; for now, but both of us need <br/>\nreassurance about this lifestyle.  Just for information purposes, <br/>\none of the things that makes us the most hesitant is in regards to <br/>\nreading - my 3 youngest still do not read AT ALL, and my 12 yr old <br/>\ncan read (but probably not at what most would consider &quot;grade <br/>\nlevel&quot;) but hates to read for any reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny insights would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nJanice W.<br/>\nLeicester, MA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13704,"nextTopicId":13866}}
