Finding things that may attract her attention and that would<br/>\nbe fun for her is great.  Good job.  When she finds something else to do<br/>\nwith the stuff you got out, that&#39;s good.  Go with it.  Dumping and pouring<br/>\nout of cups is an excellent activity for little kids to engage in.  Heck,<br/>\n3yos in expensive Montessori schools do it for hours.  She came up with that<br/>\nactivity so it&#39;s what she needs to learn and do right now.  Join in.  Have<br/>\nfun.  Colors will come some other time when you least expect them.  Really<br/>\ntruly they will.   When they do, you can be ready to play with her happily<br/>\nthere too.    <br/>\n<br/>\nSo keep bringing in stuff to broaden her world and her understanding but if<br/>\nshe finds something to do with the stuff that isn&#39;t what you had in mind,<br/>\ncelebrate.  Take notice. *That&#39;s* when real learning is taking place.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help you to talk to other parents who&#39;s kids also have Downs and<br/>\nare a little older.

Problem is that most schools are truly pushing DS kids to function like typical children.  The other problem is that in the past DS people were pushed to the background and warehoused.  Unschooling couldn&#39;t be further from either of those things.  Play with her.  Enjoy her.  Take her with you and engage her in everything you do.  She will learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to work at what was basically a nursing home for profoundly retarded youngsters.  Those kids learned a lot that was never &quot;taught&quot; to them.
