This afternoon, my four youngest were fighting over the three Xbox controllers.  No one wanted to take turns and my 4 yo ended up left out.  I remembered your words and asked myself how I could adjust this so everyone wins.  I asked my 4 yo if he would like to play w/ the play doh...he said no.  So I asked the group, would anyone like to play w/play-doh instead of Xbox and my 5 yo said yes, practically throwing the controller to my now happy 4 yo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is soooo different from how I would have handled it before.  It would have been a &quot;teaching moment&quot; in patience and sharing.  There would have been lots of crying, stress and anger before it was all over.  So happy to be learning a new way!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKristie<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - I will be buying a 4th controller ASAP!!!  :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47314,"nextTopicId":48708}}
