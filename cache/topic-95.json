He doesn&#39;t really do snuggles. Too busy.<br/>\nFor some time I have been referring to &#39;rest&#39; rather than &#39;sleep&#39;, as the other problem is that he is actually afraid of falling asleep - <br/>\nthe sensation of slipping into the unconscious. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the food ideas are great. I wonder whether I have been too worried about healthy food and what he&#39;s not eating, rather than <br/>\nplanning for how unbelievably active he is. He must burn up a huge amount of calories as he NEVER stops moving, not even in his sleep!<br/>\nI will go the smorgasbord option with high calorie stuff and see if he is happier grazing and eating on the go. Previous to this we&#39;ve been doing specific meal <br/>\ntimes and no snacks in between, which, aside from being very controlling, is perhaps not suiting his physicality.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband will be very pleased to being &#39;loved up&#39;! I think he probably often feels under-appreciated as so much focus is on the kids<br/>\nand they take every bit of energy out of us both. He&#39;s pretty low down on the food chain, probably unfairly. Family balance is not something<br/>\nthat comes very naturally to me. He does think I have crazy ideas, but is amazingly open-minded about it considering.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzie<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:plaidpanties666@...\">plaidpanties666@...</a><br/>\nDate: Tue, 12 Jul 2011 17:27:45 +0000<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Hello<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      &quot;Suzie&quot; &lt;suzepetch@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; On the sleep thing; he just seems really tired!

We are moving into less controlled ways of living. At the moment it feels as though we are dabbling, rather than unschooling, so I am pretty sure this is why we are hitting a few bumps. I have always controlled my eldest&#39;s food and sleep and we have recently been trying to let go of that. Ohhh we&#39;re finding it hard! Does it take a while for things to settle down? On the food thing; yesterday he ate 6 icecreams and has had one for breakfast this morning. I would think this is because it&#39;s been restricted and he&#39;s now exploring. Is it? He has always had a sweet tooth and doesn&#39;t like fruit or veg (unless the fruit is in a puree). He&#39;s very reluctant to try new food and rarely does. Because I am finding the 6 icecream thing hard I end up saying &quot;no&quot; by no.6, which is not what I want to be doing at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the sleep thing; he just seems really tired! He comes up to bed with us when we do, as we all sleep in the same bed, but he still wants to jump around and not go to sleep even though he is really exhausted. We then become stressed as we don&#39;t want him to wake the baby up. He still wakes fairly early and is grumpy through not getting enough sleep. Will this too settle down with a bit of time?<br/>\nIt seems to me that he&#39;s not listening to his body yet, but I am wondering how long this takes or is he too young? Or am I looking at it from totally the wrong angle?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso my husband is finding it really hard with the kids not going to bed before us, so not sure how to deal with that...<br/>\n<br/>\nAny insights would be really appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re:Hello","postDate":"1248695802","msgId":40827,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NTlGNTRDQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":40825,"nextInTopic":46970,"prevInTime":40826,"nextInTime":40828,"topicId":95,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If Kathryn and Beth put it together again next year, it should be in a similar location.

This group is really full of wonderful information!<br/>\n<br/>\nI brought up the idea of us all attending an unschool conference together as well.  There is one in Ohio in February that I want to attend, so I have been telling my Mom about it to plant the seed.  She has attended a few events we have gone to with local homeschool groups.  That group is a mix of every type of homeschool and unschool style families out together.  I know she has talked with unschool families she just may not have realized it at the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a discussion here about what unschooling looks like.  While reading I realized that Mom hasn&#39;t realized she was looking at unschooling while it was happening, even though she has participated in it herself.  The &quot;cuddling on the couch&quot; really hit home.  My daughter and I often learn while sitting on the cough chatting or reading and looking stuff up on laptops.  There have been a couple of recent incidents where we were on the couch reading or talking and my mom would walk up and say &quot;Hey lets go do school work&quot;.  I would tell her we are reading or discussing whatever we were discussing (I think it was local government) and Mom would look very confused by that.  I realize now that Mom was having this curriculum conflict then but didn&#39;t come out and say it in that way.  She also didn&#39;t recognize what my daughter and I were doing as learning.  I feel like I have a better understanding of what she was seeing now and I think that gives me a better tool for explaining and helping my mom to understand.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Hello","postDate":"1245605019","msgId":40534,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU0REFDNEVCLTA1Q0YtNDkxQi1CODVFLTExMjE4MjY3MDcwMUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGgxbGRuMSttNXVrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGgxbGRuMSttNXVrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40530,"nextInTopic":40538,"prevInTime":40533,"nextInTime":40535,"topicId":95,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There is also grandLEAP for grands!

We also have parents (mine) sharing a house with us. Our decision to homeschool got a few eyebrows raised. Moving to unschooling made heads spin. In the beginning (as more structured homeschoolers) what helped was my parents would occasionally attend things with us, like a homeschool gym class or whatever. Or we&#39;d be out and about for the day and we&#39;d stop at a park and hook up with the area homeschool buddies....while mom or dad were with us. And they got to see none of us had three heads :) That really opened their eyes to it simply being a different way of life. And now as we move into unschooling, they are there to witness the constant learning that can&#39;t be separated from life. They ask questions respectfully, I answer respectfully, realizing that them sharing a house with us is taking them on a journey totally foriegn to anything they&#39;ve previously known about &quot;school&quot;, &quot;learning&quot; or<br/>\n &quot;education.  It takes patience on everyone&#39;s part. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as your mom&#39;s specific issues with math, books/disc.groups/etc might help, or it might just take time. According to your mom, math needs to be more curriculum based. It might take her seeing your daughter figuring  it out without curriculum for her to &quot;get it&quot;. And since you&#39;re not curriculum based and trying to race against someone&#39;s calendar, it might just take time for your mom to see that it will eventually come together. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck,<br/>\nAmy<br/>\nwakeupstartlearning.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Hello","postDate":"1245499937","msgId":40508,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM2NzU5MzExLUFDREYtNDA4Qi1CQjI4LUE5MUM2QUNGMDNDRUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGgxaG4wbis1M2xyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGgxaG4wbis1M2xyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40506,"nextInTopic":40515,"prevInTime":40507,"nextInTime":40509,"topicId":95,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My husband and I started out homeschooling our daughter with a curriculum base.  As we moved on and learned more about her learning style and we became more and more relaxed homeschoolers.  Now I would call us relaxed homeschoolers with unschool leanings.  Our lifestyle is getting to be more of an unschool way of life and I love seeing my daughter thrive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever we are having some problems.  My mom doesn&#39;t get it.  My mom felt that math needed to be more curriculum based.  She just doesn&#39;t understand how a child can learn math without doing problems or memorizing multiplications tables.  She said she has vision of my daughter trying to get a job and not being able to count money and failing in life.  I encouraged mom to work with my daughter and it is very much a workbook, worksheet style of learning.  My daughter isn&#39;t really a worksheet kind of kid so this is always met with frustration for both of them.  I bought the Family Math book and mom did read and try a few things but went back to the workbooks.  She recently decided that our daughter would need to come to her and ask for math lessons.  Well guess what, she never asks.  This frustrated my mom to no end.  Mom and I had another conversation about what unschooling is and she just doesn&#39;t understand.   She feels I am failing my daughter.  I told her about (and followed up with the links in an e-mail) Dayna Martin&#39;s website and you tube videos and Sandra Dodd&#39;s website.  I have also sent her links to this discussion group, and two others.  I am hoping that she follows through and really hoping she joins in here.

The school that <br/>\nThor was in did not teach him anything, until I had to raise cane <br/>\nlast year to have them teach him the site words, help him count to <br/>\n50, and get him into an art and music programs. The school did not <br/>\nthink that Thor could learnthe site words, well he did. Thor learned <br/>\nkindergarden to 2nd grade site words. At the beginning of this year I <br/>\nwas told that the school would not help Thor with the art and music <br/>\nprogram since the was not enough funding. So, that&#39;s how we can into <br/>\nhome schooling though a friend. She told me since I&#39;m an Artist that <br/>\nI should look into unschooling for Thor. So I really don&#39;t know the <br/>\ndiffrence between the two. If someone could help me out, that would <br/>\nbe great. Thor works really well with art and music.

I imagine his panic attacks will naturally decrease as his<br/>\ninterests and spirit are supported and he is out of the stressful<br/>\nschool environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about trust. Trust that your child will learn to read<br/>\nand write when they (and only they) have a good reason to learn it<br/>\nand/or the developmental ability to learn it. Math and reading and<br/>\nwriting are all around us. They get absorbed as we explore life.<br/>\nUnschooling is about living well together, so we will focus on advice<br/>\nabout living, not teaching.:)<br/>\n<br/>\n ~~The school that Thor was in did not teach him anything, until I had<br/>\nto raise cane last year to have them teach him the site words, help<br/>\nhim count to 50, and get him into an art and music programs. The<br/>\nschool did not think that Thor could learn the site words, well he<br/>\ndid. Thor learned kindergarden to 2nd grade site words. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s &quot;sight&quot;, not &quot;site&quot;. Site is a location. Sight is related to<br/>\nvision. It sounds like you care deeply for your child (which led you<br/>\nhere) but all that energy spent fighting the school must have been<br/>\nexhausting! Isn&#39;t it great that you can now use that energy to have<br/>\nFUN together? Forget sight words and counting. He will learn those<br/>\njust fine in due time.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, I would highly recommend calling a vacation for you both to<br/>\nheal. YOu don&#39;t have to fight the system any more, he doesn&#39;t have to<br/>\nput up with the stress. You can both focus on enjoying each other&#39;s<br/>\ncompany and doing things that bring you JOY. Learning is in the joy.<br/>\nTruly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~~She told me since I&#39;m an Artist that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I should look into unschooling for Thor.~~<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You have a lovely friend to have recommended unschooling. This could<br/>\nbe a hugely life changing shift for you all. But unschooling works for<br/>\nanyone, not just artistic types! <br/>\n<br/>\n~~I have made a ton of flash <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; cards, and went out and got the both of us library cards.~~<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Flash cards are icky in my opinion. If you came and asked me to show<br/>\nyou how to paint, and I pulled out some flash cards, how would that<br/>\nmake you feel? Flash cards are great for turning into art btw.;) But<br/>\nto use them aimed at getting information into a person? Nah. Let it<br/>\ngo. He might enjoy playing with them in his own way, but I would never<br/>\nrecommend trying to &quot;teach&quot; someone with them. It&#39;s condescending.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you&#39;ve never heard of unschooling before this friend<br/>\ntalked to you. You&#39;re going to hear a lot of ideas at this list that<br/>\nare quite opposite from anything you&#39;ve heard from parents and<br/>\nteachers up to this point. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not big fans of school at home here. So keep on reading and try<br/>\nto take it all in without getting offended....which can be a challenge<br/>\nwhen parenting issues are being discussed.

My goals right now, with Thor are for his <br/>\npanic attacks to decrease, handwritting to get better, to beable to <br/>\nstart reading, and also to do simple math as of now. The school that <br/>\nThor was in did not teach him anything, until I had to raise cane <br/>\nlast year to have them teach him the site words, help him count to <br/>\n50, and get him into an art and music programs. The school did not <br/>\nthink that Thor could learnthe site words, well he did. Thor learned <br/>\nkindergarden to 2nd grade site words. At the beginning of this year I <br/>\nwas told that the school would not help Thor with the art and music <br/>\nprogram since the was not enough funding. So, that&#39;s how we can into <br/>\nhome schooling though a friend. She told me since I&#39;m an Artist that <br/>\nI should look into unschooling for Thor. So I really don&#39;t know the <br/>\ndiffrence between the two. If someone could help me out, that would <br/>\nbe great. Thor works really well with art and music. And that&#39;s why <br/>\nshe recommened me to unschooling. We are now in a program called <br/>\nUmbrella School. So,as of now I am useing the internet to go about <br/>\nidea&#39;s to help Thor with home schooling. I have made a ton of flash <br/>\ncards, and went out and got the both of us library cards. But since, <br/>\nwe live in a small town; the books that Thor can use are never there. <br/>\nAre there any sites that we can vist to help us along? I would love <br/>\nsome feedback on what I can do.

When they pop up ask yourself Why? and sit with the<br/>\nthought for a minute and see why that fear or worry is there. When<br/>\nlooked at it straight on, all those big lurking fears tend to turn from<br/>\nlions to kittens and run away. You also need time to stop looking for<br/>\nthings that look like &#39;school&#39; - learning is happening, all the time,<br/>\nreally. Learning is also NOT visible - it&#39;s internal, just like<br/>\ndigestion is internal. You can&#39;t see your kids absorbing nutrients after<br/>\nthey eat but you know it&#39;s there because they&#39;re (presumably) pretty<br/>\nhealthy and growing. School education is, in some ways, &quot;bulemia of the<br/>\nbrain&quot; - they stuff you with tons of factoids then you are required to<br/>\nregurgitate it, over and over and over. The problem is, not a lot of<br/>\nlearning &quot;nutrition&quot; is getting in. Learning is *internal* in focus and<br/>\nin motivation - it&#39;s intrinsic.<br/>\n <br/>\nSomething that might be helpful (or not) is to go pursue something of<br/>\ninterest for yourself. Not to the exclusion of the kids but if your<br/>\nbrain and hands are occupied with watercolors or soapmaking or gardening<br/>\nor whatever, your not sitting there nervously watching for signs of<br/>\n&quot;learning&quot; happening. They might come watch, they might not, they might<br/>\nwant to try it, they might not. All of that is fine. Unschooling is not<br/>\n&quot;just for kids&quot;, it&#39;s not an &quot;educational method&quot; so much as a way of<br/>\nliving and being together. Think back to your dating days - you wanted<br/>\nto know all about your Beloved and vice versa. So, you might notice<br/>\n&quot;hey, there&#39;s a new sushi place just opened up. Beloved loves sushi.<br/>\nI&#39;ll have to mention it&quot; And you do. Beloved might say &quot;COOL! Let&#39;s go!&quot;<br/>\nor maybe &quot;How about we check it out next week&quot; or maybe &quot;thanks, I&#39;ll<br/>\nkeep that in mind&quot; or any of a myriad responses. You don&#39;t just say<br/>\n&quot;There&#39;s a new sushi place. You told me last week you like sushi. So, we<br/>\nhave to go there tomorrow.&quot; Nor do you say &quot;You&#39;re 35 years old now, you<br/>\n&#39;should&#39; try sushi so I&#39;ve arranged for some books on sushi from the<br/>\nlibrary and we&#39;ll be going to a sushi restaurant on Thursday&quot; regardless<br/>\nof whether your Beloved *wants* to try sushi. However, if *you* love<br/>\nsushi, you might ask your Beloved to come along with you to your<br/>\nfavorite place, not as a &quot;lesson&quot; or &quot;learning experience&quot; but simply to<br/>\nshare something that brings you joy. Beloved may or may not end up<br/>\nliking sushi and that&#39;s fine. So, your &quot;mission&quot; is to be a &#39;student&#39; of<br/>\nyour kids and find ways to support and facilitate things - drive them to<br/>\nplaces, help them look up stuff online, whatever *at their request for<br/>\nhowever long they have interest*. They might want to know where the word<br/>\n&quot;window&quot; comes from. If all they need is a 2 minute look up in the<br/>\ndictionary to check out that it comes from a Latin root meaning &quot;see<br/>\nthrough piece of glass&quot; that&#39;s where it stops. If they then want to go<br/>\npaint with glass paint on the windows, that&#39;s what happens next - no<br/>\n&quot;history of windows&quot; lessons or books on windows or whatever,<br/>\nuntil/unless that is the direction they want to take it. (Is this making<br/>\nsense?)<br/>\n <br/>\nWe have LOTS of games and books and rolls of duct tape (hubby&#39;s current<br/>\ncreative passion) and paper towel tubes and toilet paper tubes and empty<br/>\negg cartons and boxes and movies and music and videogames and magazines<br/>\nand markers and craft sticks and all sorts of stuff.  Neither staying<br/>\nhome NOR going out are necessary for &quot;encouraging creativity&quot; - each<br/>\nperson is different. Some are inspired by a walk in the woods or the<br/>\nshape of a playscape or a big empty beach to build on while others are<br/>\nat their most creative at 2 in the morning with a word processor or<br/>\nvideo capture software or a big sketchpad and colored pencils.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat constitutes &quot;too busy&quot; varies by person, by family, by &quot;season&quot;. We<br/>\nhave times when we&#39;re home pretty much every day. We have times when<br/>\nwe&#39;re doing things out and about often. For us, having more than 3 or 4<br/>\n&quot;scheduled&quot; things per week is plenty, but assorted spontaneous stuff<br/>\ncomes up and we decide -as a family- if anyone is interested, do we want<br/>\nto do this, and so on. Sometimes a spontaneous trip to a park or a movie<br/>\nor whatever is great. Other times we&#39;d rather just hang out at home and<br/>\nmaybe watch a DVD or play a board game or simply just BE at home<br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
