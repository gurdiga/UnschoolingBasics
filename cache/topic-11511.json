So I mentioned that some folks<br/>\nhomeschool for that very reason.  And dh said &quot;well, we should do that.&quot;<br/>\nAaakk!  I meant OTHER people homeschool.  Not ME!  I couldn&#39;t homeschool -<br/>\nI&#39;m not organized enough LOL  (I&#39;m not big on cooking or cleaning either.<br/>\nAlthough I can dance!)
