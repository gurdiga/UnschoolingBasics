So many people mistakenly <br/>\nbelieve that but if one studies the Bible in its entirety then one will <br/>\nsee that it all ultimately comes down to Jesus (without confusion or <br/>\nanything of that nature.)<br/>\nI would love for you to tell us where you find the Bible verse(s) <br/>\nbacking up what you said below about &quot;anyone ignorant of truth is <br/>\ninnocent....&quot;  because nowhere in my Bible does it say anything like that. <br/>\nWe are directed to go and tell ALL nations and God is basically <br/>\n&quot;waiting&quot; until all nations are told.  Doors open in far-distant lands <br/>\nall the time allowing missionaries / evangelists to reach those far-off <br/>\nremote places to tell those peoples about Jesus.  In Romans 3:23 we are <br/>\ntold that &quot;ALL of us have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.&quot;  <br/>\nThis includes those people in the remotest corners of the Earth.  In <br/>\nRomans 1:18-20 we read &quot;The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven <br/>\nagainst all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth <br/>\nby their  wickedness, since _*what may be known about God is plain to <br/>\nthem, because God has made it plain to them.  For since the creation of <br/>\nthe world God&#39;s invisible qualities - have been clearly seen, being <br/>\nunderstood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.&quot; <br/>\n*_Even people who haven&#39;t heard about Jesus have a conscience and an <br/>\nunderstanding of right from wrong and an understanding of a greater <br/>\n&quot;being&quot; who created everything.....that&#39;s God!  God has made everyone <br/>\nwith that knowledge!  Now it is up to Christians to reach everyone with <br/>\nthe good news of Jesus shedding His precious blood for us to save us <br/>\nfrom the eternal lake of fire.<br/>\nWe also know that &quot;God wants all men to be saved and to come to a <br/>\nknowledge of the truth.&quot; (1 Timothy 2:4) so we must trust Him with our <br/>\nuncertainties about the fate of others.  We may be unsure about what God <br/>\nwill do with those who never hear the gospel but there is no doubt about <br/>\nOUR responsibility toward those who have yet to hear!  We are directed <br/>\nover and over again that we are to &quot;make disciples of all nations&quot; (Matt <br/>\n28:19).  He has entrusted us with the privilege of taking his gospel &quot;to <br/>\nthe ends of the earth.&quot; (Acts 1:8)  If God is not wanting anyone to <br/>\nperish (2 Peter 3:9), then we should not stand around idle while untold <br/>\nmillions go through life never hearing the good news of God&#39;s mercy.  <br/>\nNow He will deal differently with those who are told about Jesus and <br/>\nrefuse to accept it and/or lead others away from that knowledge through <br/>\ntheir &quot;false teachings&quot;!  In John 3:36 &quot;Whoever believes in the Son has <br/>\neternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God&#39;s <br/>\nwrath remains on him.&quot;<br/>\nElisa<br/>\n<br/>\nRen Allen wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot; My opinion<br/>\n&gt; is that Christianity is meant to be evangalistic. That is to say<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; Christians who earnestly believe that Christ died for everyones sin,<br/>\n&gt; and belief in Him is the only way to heaven; we can not work our way<br/>\n&gt; there or ever be good enough to earn it, believe that they should<br/>\n&gt; share that with everyone. &quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess that&#39;s one of my huge issues with most Christians....I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; tired of anyone assuming what I need.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other issue I have, is the Bible says that anyone ignorant of<br/>\n&gt; truth is innocent and not to be held accountable. So if people that<br/>\n&gt; are ignorant of Christ and the gospel message are going to heaven,<br/>\n&gt; why would anyone evangalize to them and risk sending them to hell?<br/>\n&gt; Seems evangalism would send more to hell than if you just let<br/>\n&gt; everyone be ignorant.<br/>\n&gt; One of the many paradoxes that make zero sense. &#39;Course, that&#39;s why<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not a Christian.;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; YAHOO!

Abraham was not a perfect man, he sold his wife to Kings to save his own hide when he was an alien in foreign countries and slept with his wife&#39;s maidservant thereby committing adultry but he had faith that God would do what he said he would do, but that is old testament and although we believe the old testament because it precurses the new testament, we do not live by it. We live by the new testament which is grace through Christ. Grace that we are not perfect and we will screw up but that if we seek forgiveness for those things whether thought, word or deed and turn away from doing it again, we will receive it. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Jennifer <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, August 23, 2005 12:32 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] spanking christians<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you know where it says that, Ren??
