He is a very <br/>\n  lively, interesting kid!  She also has three girls, all younger than <br/>\n  Ryan.  They are very unschooly but not TOTALLY unschoolers.  They do <br/>\n  a little workbook stuff, just enough to satisfy the program that <br/>\n  they are in so that they get there money but really unschoolers at <br/>\n  heart, or at least VERY supportive of unschoolers,if you kwim.
