Our once robust sunflowers are <br/>\nnow burnt-brown seed-heads – picked at by wild birds. Honeybees huddle together <br/>\nkeeping their hives warm and safe for the winter. Bumblebee queens dive into <br/>\ntheir underground burrows to wait out the dark months until flowers open their <br/>\nblooms to them again. The phases of nature are beautiful to watch in any season. <br/>\nThese phases or stages of birth, growth, decay and rebirth are known to some <br/>\nscientists as “phenology.” <br/>\n<br/>\nThe word comes from the Greek word phaino , which means to “show or appear.” The <br/>\nfirst leaves of a plant show above the spring soil, flowers bloom, seeds form <br/>\nbehind the faded blossoms, and songbirds long-gone from the fencepost now return <br/>\nto harvest the bounty. Queen bees emerge to give birth. Nature shows us these <br/>\nsame wonders every year, but not always at the same time.<br/>\nThat’s why phenology is important. And, as our climate changes, we have an <br/>\nopportunity to observe and record when these events show up from year to year. <br/>\nThe National Phenology Network (NPN), a partner organization to the Great <br/>\nSunflower Project, is tracking observations of plant phenology, just like we are <br/>\ntracking pollinators. Tracking this information helps scientists know when <br/>\nallergy season starts, when crops ripen and when fire danger is high. Important <br/>\ntimelines, and not always predictable unless citizen scientists like us help <br/>\nout. If you want to learn more, check out the NPN’s citizen science initiative <br/>\n“Nature’s Notebook” and record your own observations.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nHere are the links:<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.usanpn.org/participate\">http://www.usanpn.org/participate</a><br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.greatsunflower.org/\">http://www.greatsunflower.org/</a><br/>\n  <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45010,"nextTopicId":18965}}
