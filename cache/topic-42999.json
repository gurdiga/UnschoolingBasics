This post is timely for me....prepare for a pour your heart out post here...<br/>\n<br/>\nOpportunities to socialize are a major source of depression for me right now!!!  :(  I live in a small village of a thousand or so about 5km (2 1/2 mi or so ) from a city of 10,000 people, and 45min from our provincial capital.  The local school is the focal point of where I live for meeting people, and you go to other places to work and just come home to here to sleep, basically.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find I have NOTHING in common with those in real life around me, because of the demographics of the area.  I work (very) part time but almost no one there has kids and are 20 years younger.  We can&#39;t afford sports and my kids do not like the strictness and organization and competitiveness (another common way to meet up with others here) It has a large German-Russian immigrant population, and is Mennonite from generations back, there are a huge number of churches per capita.  This affects the homeschooling...lots of STRICT school-at-home-sign a statement of faith groups of 10-15 families around here who have the same church in common, as well as the &quot;typical&quot; view of children/learning (sinful creatures who need to be put in line, basically...very incompatible with the unschooling/attachment parenting world view).  From what I have seen in attempting to join some of the local gym times with my kids, I am feeling very much like an alien. I am an atheist, although I do NOT toot this to anybody...we don&#39;t go to church, so that social base is gone. My kids especially dd do not do well in organized classes like at the art&#39;s center...too much following someone&#39;s agenda like all the sheep there.  I am an unschooler.  I am one of those homeschoolers who does nothing but &quot;dig potatoes and doesn&#39;t &#39;do&#39; school&quot; (a derogatory comment made to me by someone in the hs group about unschoolers who didn&#39;t know I was one.) Then when I see their kids so &quot;advanced&quot; in academic ways compared to mine (although I know my kids have learned and grown so much by us exploring their interests), I feel intimidated and think unschooling doesn&#39;t &quot;work&quot; and my faith is shaken in it again...(and I come here and post about math or something LOL!) but I try to tell myself their kids pay a dear price...I literally have seen ones missing the biweekly gym time because they were at home doing the schoolwork that they refused to do in the morning when mom wanted them too (Aaack!!!!!)  I don&#39;t want that either!<br/>\n<br/>\nSigh...I feel very discouraged and lonely.  And yes, I will admit this past summer when I saw so many kids in my village hanging out and walking to the store or something, I felt a pang for my kids.  That they have just a handful of aquaintences, not close friends, and there is pretty much no one who just wants to &quot;hang out&quot; and free-play with them...everyone&#39;s kids including the homeschoolers are so damn overbooked with classes and everything (which my kids don&#39;t enjoy either).  I&#39;ve put out ads to meet in the park, etc with not a single person showing.  Going to hs field trips and stuff gives us a &quot;contact&quot; or a familiarity but it doesn&#39;t go beyond that...just a brief passing in the wind.  So far my kids seem to be OK playing with each other and seeing others only the 2-3x a month we manage, but I think dd is starting to want a bit more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry ladies, I just had to spit all that out for some feedback or a different perspective.  It&#39;s the one thing I do not like about homeschooling around here.  I think we would have more of a &quot;base&quot; of things in common with others if I was an ultra-right wing-conservative fundementalist hockey--ballet-piano 3 days-a week-public school- sort of family, but it ain&#39;t gonna happen! Too many trade offs. <br/>\n<br/>\nSupport....reading READING READING online, here, MotheringDotCommune, Anne&#39;s ShinewithUnschooling.

I&#39;ve also found that it helps to look for people with similar interests rather than focusing on age, or even &quot;unschooliness&quot;. With little kids, age and interest can have a lot in common because young children often have similar likes, but not always, and personalities can make a big difference in terms of even little ones getting along. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has always been better for Ray to have friends who were adults or kids who were much older. It just didn&#39;t work for him to play with other kids when he could seriously hurt them, for one, and for another what he needed most was attention, one-on-one socializing, rather than in a group. That&#39;s something an adult does much better than a similar-age child who could also like to be the center of attention. <br/>\n<br/>\nMo is much more of an introvert, so we&#39;ve never done a vast number of play-dates. She has a few friends she sees now and then, some kids, some adults, but mostly she&#39;s happy with her family. Actually, as social as Ray is, sometimes Mo gets all she can take of &quot;other people&quot; just by being at home, and can&#39;t bear the idea of going out. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do much the same for my own social needs - and my partner, too. Rather than looking for &quot;other parents&quot; to socialize with, we look for people with *other* shared interests, and connect with unschooling parents at conferences and unschooling gatherings (and online - there&#39;s a reason I&#39;m on the list a lot, y&#39;all keep me sane some days!).<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":241904499,"authorName":"zurro","from":"&quot;zurro&quot; &lt;zurrolaur@...&gt;","profile":"zurrolaur","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Community with lots of unschoolers and if not how do you cope","postDate":"1264304899","msgId":42999,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhqZ2Z1MytxMjgxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43003,"prevInTime":42998,"nextInTime":43000,"topicId":42999,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a question for those of you that have been unschooling for some time: Do you live in a community that has a lot of unschoolers?
