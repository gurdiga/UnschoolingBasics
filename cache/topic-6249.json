But the question I was  asking<br/>\nis whether they can sit at home and get  drunk?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************<br/>\nKathy, I&#39;ve read all of your posts and what I&#39;m seeing is a lot of  <br/>\nfear...but you&#39;re still here. Interesting. <br/>\n <br/>\nI have a very-close-to-16 year old son who wants to be a rock star. We talk  <br/>\nabout things like drugs, alcohol, and sex a lot. We talk about why people <br/>\nmight  want to use or abuse any of those things. We talk about their use without <br/>\nabuse.  We talk about concerns and consequences.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou asked &quot;whether they can sit at home and get  drunk?&quot;  What I&#39;m saying to <br/>\nyou is that it&#39;s the  wrong question. Here&#39;s an analogy, something I thought <br/>\nof when I read your  post.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am a Unitarian Universalist. It is a creedless  religion with no required <br/>\ndogma, and UU&#39;s get challenged on this a lot. I read  this anecdote where <br/>\nsomeone was challenging a UU and said, &quot;So you can rape and  murder or steal if you <br/>\nwant?&quot;  The UU&#39;s response was &quot;Is raping and  murdering and stealing what YOU <br/>\nwant to do?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nYour question was whether it&#39;d be okay for my kid to  sit at home and get <br/>\ndrunk. I can&#39;t imagine why he would want to do that. People  tend to get drunk <br/>\neither because they are in a festive situation with others and  find it <br/>\npleasant, or because they have a problem. People who &quot;sit at home and  get drunk&quot; <br/>\nrarely do it as a hobby.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf Julian wanted, perhaps, to get drunk because he  wanted to know what it <br/>\nfelt like, I suppose he&#39;d be safer doing at home with  people who loved him. He <br/>\nhas no real desire to do that, partially I&#39;ve honestly  described my own only <br/>\nexperience with being drunk (&quot;It was sort of fun because  it felt silly and <br/>\nuninhibited for a bit, but then I got really sick and it  really wasn&#39;t worth <br/>\nit, for me, to try again.&quot;)  If he sincerely asked for  that, I don&#39;t know what <br/>\nmy response would be, but I&#39;d think about  it.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut again, it&#39;s NOT the right question, partly because  it&#39;s not really <br/>\nlikely to come up.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I hear in your fear is &quot;Can I really say yes to my  children almost all <br/>\nof the time and still have them turn out to be safe, happy,  prepared for <br/>\nlife, not a drain on society, etc. etc.?&quot; &quot;Can I spare the rod, the  time-out, the <br/>\npackaged curriculum, the food restrictions, etc. and still have  them be <br/>\npleasant, healthy, good people?&quot; Maybe even, &quot;This all sounds wonderful  but it <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t possibly work. Could it?!?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI can answer that question with a passionate YES! YES!  YES!<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201952787,"authorName":"polykow","from":"&quot;polykow&quot; &lt;polykow@...&gt;","profile":"polykow","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] sex and alcohol","postDate":"1124819716","msgId":6260,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDEwMWM1YTgwYiRkNzY0MmJhMCQ3ZTUwOWYwNEBwYXZpbGlvbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDQwMWM1YTdmZCRkMDlhODg0MCRmZTQyZjdhNUBTUEFNPg=="},"prevInTopic":6256,"nextInTopic":6263,"prevInTime":6259,"nextInTime":6261,"topicId":6249,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I usually just lurk since I can t write well enough and still have lots to learn.

Only add to that I wasn&#39; t allowed to see my friends on a Sunday and I wasn&#39;t allowed to buy anything on a Sunday. I had to go to church 3 times a week. It just made me kick against their control.  I wouldn&#39;t be be seen dead in a church now.  I don&#39;t have any beliefs they have and I do the opposite with my children to what they did with me.<br/>\nRuth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":26911470,"authorName":"Rod Thomas","from":"&quot;Rod Thomas&quot; &lt;flyerrod@...&gt;","profile":"flyerkat","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] sex and alcohol","postDate":"1124813700","msgId":6252,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDQwMWM1YTdmZCRkMDlhODg0MCRmZTQyZjdhNUBTUEFNPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRlZmhmYisxbG5tQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":6251,"nextInTopic":6256,"prevInTime":6251,"nextInTime":6253,"topicId":6249,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I know they will, that is my point also.

Will you allow it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve already &quot;allowed&quot; it.... My children know that I&#39;m not against <br/>\ndrinking, I have issues with irresponsible drinking. I trust them to <br/>\nmake their own decisions, I trust that will be the best decision for <br/>\ntheir life. I also give them good information ahead of time if I see <br/>\nsomething that might go wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest knows that I will gladly pick him up at any time of night, <br/>\nfrom ANYWHERE, no questions asked. His closest friends are <br/>\nunschoolers too....none of them think drinking is anything <br/>\nfascinating. They don&#39;t care about being out late, they are up late <br/>\nanytime they want. They don&#39;t crave getting away from their <br/>\nfamilies, they think their families are pretty awesome.<br/>\nMany factors are affecting how these teens interact with their peers <br/>\nand community. Far different from my own life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recognize that I can&#39;t allow or disallow anything...only create a <br/>\nsituation in which we have optimum communication and trust. He&#39;s <br/>\ngoing to do things whether I allow it or not, he&#39;s 15!!<br/>\nHe has no reason to sneak or try anything harmful, his parents are <br/>\non his side.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to say he won&#39;t do things I disagree with...that is a very real <br/>\npossibility, but something I&#39;m prepared to accept and keep dialogue <br/>\nopen about.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, he plays video games and listens to music I find very <br/>\ndisagreeable at times. But it all comes back to trust.<br/>\nI see the violent video games and scratch my head, but then he joins <br/>\npeace rallies and shows a depth of character and kindness that not <br/>\nmany at his age seem to possess and I know he&#39;s following his own <br/>\nlight.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he chooses to drink or have sex, he will be armed with good <br/>\ninformation, parents that are available, more common sense than most <br/>\nteens and the ability to know himself on a deep level.<br/>\nThat&#39;s going into it well armed....more than I ever had.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6407,"nextTopicId":6414}}
