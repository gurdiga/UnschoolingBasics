I tried to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2049640742\">I believe it was Caren on this or another list that was asking about <br/>\npatents and we emailed privately and I&#39;ll paste here what I emailed <br/>\nher about.  I tried to email you this directly, but your email was <br/>\nprivate...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was discussing your patent question with my husband and had some <br/>\nmore insight.  The U.S. is a &quot;first to invent&quot; country with respect <br/>\nto intellectual property.  Some other countries are &quot;first to file&quot;.  <br/>\nIn the ftf countries, your idea can get &quot;stolen&quot; by someone simply <br/>\nbeating you to the country&#39;s patent office.  This can&#39;t happen in the <br/>\nU.S and other fti countries, as long as you do basic things to <br/>\nprotect your idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first is documentation.  If you have not already done so, write <br/>\ndown as explicitly as possible how and when you came up with this <br/>\nidea.  Your &quot;priority date&quot; won&#39;t be that day that you &quot;invented&quot; the <br/>\nidea, but the day you document it.  (As long as your priority date is <br/>\nbefore anyone else claiming the same idea, you win out). Make the <br/>\ndocument complete, sign it, and have someone (anyone who can <br/>\nunderstand the idea) read over it and date and sign it too.  For <br/>\nadded oomph, you can have the document notarized.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow there is the issue of &quot;diligence&quot;.  This means that you can&#39;t <br/>\ncome up with an idea, document it, put it in a drawer and do nothing <br/>\nfor 10 years and sue someone who patents the same idea and makes <br/>\nmoney later, even if you had an earlier priority date.  The purpose <br/>\nof the U.S. patent system is to encourage innovation for the <br/>\nproduction of products/services that will better our society, so you <br/>\nget protection, but only on the condition you don&#39;t shelve it to look <br/>\nfor an opportunity to prey on someone who went beyond just thinking <br/>\nabout the idea.  Diligence means that you are regularly (not <br/>\nnecessarily exhaustively or constantly, but regularly) pursuing your <br/>\nidea.  This could be by refining or making improvements, phone calls <br/>\nto potential companies to market it, off shoots of the idea, business <br/>\ncontacts, etc.  You should document any time you make any forward <br/>\nprogress on the invention or the pursuit of its commercialization or <br/>\nimprovement and always date, sign and witness.  As long as you <br/>\npractice original documentation of the idea and diligence your idea <br/>\nis protected--until disclosure.<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic disclosure means telling someone (especially an interested <br/>\ncompany) about your idea without a non-disclosure agreement (which <br/>\nwould be private).  Most companies wouldn&#39;t sign a non-disclosure <br/>\nagreement because of the legal hassle that would arise if they <br/>\npreviously had the same idea.  So, a company you approach may listen <br/>\nto your idea, but not under a secrecy agreement.  Once a disclosure <br/>\nof this nature occurs (or, in science you give a talk at a conference <br/>\nor write a paper, which is the most common example of public <br/>\ndisclosure), you have ONE YEAR to file a patent.  This could be a <br/>\ncheap short provisional patent filed by you, a patent agent (cheaper <br/>\nthan an attorney), or attorney.  After a provisional is filed, you <br/>\nhave one year to file a full patent that would be reviewed by the <br/>\nUSPTO.  Provisionals aren&#39;t reviewed by the USPTO, they are basically <br/>\na placeholder that sets a priority date and provides documentation of <br/>\nthe invention, but as I said above, less formal documentation is just <br/>\nas powerful as long as you sign, date, and witness everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully this all makes sense.  My husband and I would do the <br/>\nfollowing in your situation:<br/>\n1.  Document your idea as clearly and completely as possible.  <br/>\nInclude dates and the reasoning and motivation behind the idea.  Date <br/>\nthe document (don&#39;t backdate it to when you had the idea--it would be <br/>\nthe first thing that would invalidate your protection if it ever <br/>\ncould be proven).  Sign and have a witness read, sign and date.  A <br/>\npatent attorney would ask for any of this documentation if you were <br/>\nto file anyways, so it&#39;ll save you trouble.<br/>\n2.  Keep the idea a secret from everyone to avoid starting the <br/>\ndisclosure clock ticking.  You have one year to file a patent from <br/>\nwhen you tell someone about it, although competitors and business <br/>\nfolks are the only ones you&#39;d really have to worry about, since they <br/>\nwould be the only ones that may try to invalidate your patent for <br/>\nbreaking that rule.<br/>\n3.  Document all improvements, additions, changes to your idea as <br/>\nwell as dates of disclosure, meetings, any time you read something or <br/>\nfind more information.  The easiest thing to do is to have a kind <br/>\nof &quot;lab notebook&quot; with permanently bound pages (not spiral) and don&#39;t <br/>\nskip or tear out pages.  This proves dates, sequentiality, etc for <br/>\ndocumentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you approach a company with your idea, as I said before, they <br/>\nprobably won&#39;t agree to secrecy, so that would start the one year <br/>\nclock ticking FOR SURE.  Approaching the company with an idea for <br/>\ntheir product is a reasonable idea and sometimes is fruitful.  Just <br/>\nhave all your documentation and make sure they know how diligent you <br/>\nhave been in your documentation and pursuit--simply be organized.  If <br/>\nthey love your idea, they may offer to &quot;buy&quot; it off you by helping <br/>\nyou patent it (where you are listed as an inventor and they are <br/>\nlisted as the owner) and then offering you payment or even a royalty <br/>\nof x% of sales of the repackaged product.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is named as inventor on over a dozen patents.  He has lots <br/>\nof experience, but we have learned a valuable lesson.  Running out to <br/>\nfile a patent before all else is a &quot;rookie mistake&quot; for inventors.  <br/>\n99.5+% of all granted patents don&#39;t make any money (doesn&#39;t even <br/>\ninclude ones filed and not pursued further or those rejected).  The <br/>\nonly people getting rich in the patent game are patent lawyers!  Most <br/>\npeople don&#39;t know any of the above and don&#39;t realize that appropriate <br/>\ndocumentation and diligence give you just as much protection, without <br/>\nhaving to go out on a personal financial limb for something that may <br/>\nnot be marketable or practical or of interest to anyone, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go to a patent agent/lawyer, they are naturally going to tell <br/>\nyou to file a patent, their bread and butter.  If you take this <br/>\nroute, I wouldn&#39;t do more than a provisional before getting better <br/>\nindications that there are companies interested.  You&#39;d then have a <br/>\nyear after a provisional to file a full patent and spend the big $$.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this clears the waters more than muddying them for you, <br/>\nJulie M<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;trektheory&quot; <br/>\n&lt;trektheory@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone got any experience with patenting a game/puzzle concept? <br/>\n&gt; My ds has an idea, made a prototype, and ultimately wants to market<br/>\n&gt; this idea.
