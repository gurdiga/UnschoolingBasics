I know for him it&#39;s not that he wants <br/>\nto smoke, he just likes the image of the wise man with a pipe.  He <br/>\nconsiders himself a philosopher and a wizard and the pipe is like a <br/>\nprop.  I think just having it may do the trick.<br/>\n<br/>\nin peace,<br/>\nDianna(too old to mention) Annie(9) Matthew(15)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: pipe smoke","postDate":"1179676160","msgId":23852,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYycHFtMCtiN2VjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYyb2psais5YWozQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23847,"nextInTopic":23862,"prevInTime":23851,"nextInTime":23853,"topicId":23847,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The <br/>\nmechanics are a bit different. I would think it would be valuble for <br/>\nhim to talk with someone who smokes a tobacco pipe and get some <br/>\ninformation about *how* to do what he wants to do - it sounds like <br/>\nhe&#39;s more interested in drawing the smoke into his mouth and blowing <br/>\nit out again and there&#39;s sort of a trick to that. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, you&#39;ll also want to check local laws wrt the legality of <br/>\nhim smoking tobacco - not something I&#39;ve looked into, since my <br/>\nstepson isn&#39;t interested in tobacco at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else to look into is smoking different kinds of herbs - <br/>\nI&#39;m thinking of mullein in particular. Its an old time herbal remedy <br/>\nfor chest congestion. If he&#39;s only wanting to smoke occasionally for <br/>\neffect, and wants to avoid the nicotine issue entirely, mullein or <br/>\nsomething similar might fit the bill. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5.5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":285628717,"authorName":"thehomeopathicway","from":"&quot;thehomeopathicway&quot; &lt;thehomeopathicway@...&gt;","profile":"thehomeopathicway","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"pipe smoke","postDate":"1179636211","msgId":23847,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYyb2psais5YWozQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23852,"prevInTime":23846,"nextInTime":23848,"topicId":23847,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My ds15 is a great kid.

Lately, <br/>\nhe has had this fascination with smoking a pipe.  We love Lord of the <br/>\nRings and Harry Potter and he thinks it&#39;s wizardly and wise to puff on <br/>\na pipe when you are contemplating something or working on something. He <br/>\nloves the idea of it.  He tried to buy one at a ren faire, but they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t sell it to him because he is not 18.  A part of me thinks it&#39;s <br/>\nvery dangerous to start this so early (I started smoking cigarettes <br/>\nwhen I was his age and didn&#39;t quit for 10 years) and my mother had <br/>\nmouth cancer.  When I share my fear with him, he says it is not his <br/>\nintention to get sick from puffing on a pipe so he won&#39;t.  <br/>\nI just can&#39;t see my boy smoking a pipe at this age (my think, I know).  <br/>\nHe wanted to try beer and wine for the same reason and it only took one <br/>\nsip of each for him to realize he didn&#39;t like it and didn&#39;t want to <br/>\ndrink either.  I would like to think the pipe thing would be the same <br/>\nway, but it may not be.  <br/>\nAny thoughts or ideas are most appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nin peace,<br/>\nDianna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23674,"nextTopicId":19190}}
