I was/am passionate about this poor kid,<br/>\n  ANY kid, really, whose sexuality has been invisible to their adults (or<br/>\n  worse, whose sexuality has been the cause of undiscussed and unidentified<br/>\n  stressors in their adults). This response is not intended specifically for<br/>\n  the OP, truly I want to catch parents *before* they end up in her<br/>\n  situation. Pretend I&#39;m your bestest friend in the whole universe, the one<br/>\n  person who can get away with saying anything to you because you know it<br/>\n  comes from a place of great love, then read:<br/>\n<br/>\n  My first question is: You&#39;ve had 13+ years to think about your child&#39;s<br/>\n  sexuality... what has your conversation been like, in your head,<br/>\n  up til now? Did you think you&#39;d skate through your child&#39;s life and not<br/>\n  have to talk about healthy sexuality? Who would talk to them about sex<br/>\n  instead of you? Where are they going to get information if it cannot (at<br/>\n  least healthily) be accessed at home?<br/>\n  Maybe this is a wake-up call to anyone on this list who has yet to *begin*<br/>\n  thinking about their child as a sexual being. S/he is! There is (in my not<br/>\n  so humble opinion) no excuse for their sexual curiosity arriving as a<br/>\n  SURPRISE!! OF COURSE, kids are curious! They tend (in my experience) to be<br/>\n  curious about *everything* about being a human being - sexuality included!<br/>\n<br/>\n  My human sexuality conversation started one day when Hannah was very young,<br/>\n  circa 2, and we were looking at pictures of our honeymoon at Disneyland.<br/>\n  Hannah wanted us to take her to Disneyland *right now* -- and I said, &quot;You<br/>\n  were there with me! You were an egg, waiting in line, hoping one day to<br/>\n  *poof* turn into a little girl for us to take *back* to Disneyland.&quot;<br/>\n  Talking about her potential babies always being with her, was a conversation<br/>\n  we continued, as it came up and as it expanded (i.e. Hayden is NOT carrying<br/>\n  his potential children with him his whole life), and even (especially) as<br/>\n  she began chemotherapy. It seemed so flowing and natural.<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think I got private toileting moments until the last 2 years<br/>\n  (hayden&#39;s now 10)... talking about Mommy&#39;s moon time is talking about human<br/>\n  sexuality. It&#39;s really, really that simple to get started.<br/>\n  The Unitarian Universalists and the United Church of Christ got together a<br/>\n  decade or so ago and created a comprehensive sex ed curriculum K-Adult,<br/>\n  called Our Whole Life<br/>\n  (OWL&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uua.org/religiouseducation/curricula/ourwhole/\">http://www.uua.org/religiouseducation/curricula/ourwhole/</a>&gt;).<br/>\n  [there is an optional spiritual component to this set, the information<br/>\n  itself is not faith-based] My kids didn&#39;t go to the program, I didn&#39;t want<br/>\n  sexuality to be a CLASS, it was already like a nice thread throughout the<br/>\n  weave of our life (as it truly is!), so I can&#39;t speak to being a parent of<br/>\n  the program. I can speak as a facilitator for the two levels of teen courses<br/>\n  (11-14 & 15-18 roughly). I was incredibly glad to have the opportunity to<br/>\n  be a resource for these kids, I was incredibly sad when I discovered for<br/>\n  whom I was their first resource. We talked - a lot - and that seems to be<br/>\n  the one thing that young humans want from the older ones - an opportunity to<br/>\n  *have the conversation* - if not with you, then with another trusted adult<br/>\n  in your life.<br/>\n  This was a common thread throughout the conversations I&#39;ve had with<br/>\n  unschooled teens - &quot;Strew the info and find me a trusted someone to talk to<br/>\n  about it.&quot; Sometimes (and sorry, it is rare) they&#39;re comfortable fully with<br/>\n  their parents; the surprise to me was even the coolest parents in the world<br/>\n  weren&#39;t the perfect fit to talk intimate details about sex with. And it was<br/>\n  NOT a judgment against the parents in ANY WAY - it was a true expression of<br/>\n  comfort on the part of the young people.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Strewing ideas:<br/>\n  *The Joy of Sex (leave it on the bookshelf or coffee table)<br/>\n  *Our Bodies Our Selves (ditto)<br/>\n  *It&#39;s Perfectly<br/>\n  Normal&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Its-Perfectly-Normal-Changing-Growing/dp/1564021599\">http://www.amazon.com/Its-Perfectly-Normal-Changing-Growing/dp/1564021599</a>&gt;(it<br/>\n  seems there is a lot of this available on line, in sections anyway, I<br/>\n  found the lovemaking and masturbation chapters on .pdf and on youtube, hee<br/>\n  hee, so I guess kids ARE reading it and sharing with their friends - YAY!<br/>\n  And of course, in the spirit of balance, I&#39;ll take you to my blogpost about<br/>\n  propoganda I received about this very book *warning* there are blurred body<br/>\n  parts! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hahamommy.blogspot.com/2008/03/ken-barbie-are-republicans.html\">http://hahamommy.blogspot.com/2008/03/ken-barbie-are-republicans.html</a><br/>\n  )<br/>\n  *There&#39;s even a couple of cool sex shows on HBO &quot;real sex&quot; and a by topic<br/>\n  show with Katie Morgan (raised a *repressed* homeschooler who grew up to be<br/>\n  a porn star - surprise?)<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/katiemorgan/index.html\">http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/katiemorgan/index.html</a><br/>\n  *MySpace - we saw a button that said &quot;Everytime you see a rainbow, God&#39;s<br/>\n  having gay sex&quot; Hayden and I giggled. The next time we saw a rainbow he said<br/>\n  &quot;eh, looks like god&#39;s having butt sex&quot; I laughed and clarified that butt sex<br/>\n  isn&#39;t just for gays and not all gays do that. Because it was in a moment of<br/>\n  humor, I didn&#39;t expand and it sunk in.<br/>\n  *TV & Pop Culture - Jamie Lynn Spears got pregnant while filming Zoey 101 --<br/>\n  perfect time for talking!

Family Guy is another great source of talk fodder -<br/>\n  Stewie&#39;s obsession with his parents&#39; ability to continue to reproduce,<br/>\n  including his 1/2 brother via the spermbank (among others) - hilarious!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess the hardest part may be getting over your own voices in your own<br/>\n  head... the littler ones? they&#39;re just waiting to have a conversation :D<br/>\n  ~diana :)<br/>\n  xoxoxoxo<br/>\n  hannahbearski.blogspot.com<br/>\n  hannahsashes.blogspot.com<br/>\n  dianas365.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n  OMG....my biggest freak out of the week: I walked into the dining room to<br/>\n  &gt; see Billy (13) on his laptop googling porn. &lt;roll&gt; Just what I need. Guy and<br/>\n  &gt; girl, and I was like PLEASE make my life easy and just be looking at girls<br/>\n  &gt; (nice huh?). Neither dh or I have any healthy background on sexuality: he<br/>\n  &gt; was beaten from two on for touching himself and STILL won&#39;t talk about sex<br/>\n  &gt; after 15 years of marriage. I&#39;ve handled all the issues with the kids, but I<br/>\n  &gt; was molested and have such issues with porn. Makes me sick. I thought I<br/>\n  &gt; handled it well, just said something like I&#39;d rather he did that in his room<br/>\n  &gt; so that the littles didn&#39;t see it. But I know I was raging hormones by his<br/>\n  &gt; age, and my mom was blaming me for being molested and then raped; and I just<br/>\n  &gt; do NOT know how to handle this.

This response is not intended specifically for<br/>\nthe OP, truly I want to catch parents *before* they end up in her<br/>\nsituation.  Pretend I&#39;m your bestest friend in the whole universe, the one<br/>\nperson who can get away with saying anything to you because you know it<br/>\ncomes from a place of great love, then read:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first question is: You&#39;ve had 13+ years to think about your child&#39;s<br/>\nsexuality... what has your conversation been like, in your head,<br/>\nup til now?  Did you think you&#39;d skate through your child&#39;s life and not<br/>\nhave to talk about healthy sexuality? Who would talk to them about sex<br/>\ninstead of you? Where are they going to get information if it cannot (at<br/>\nleast healthily) be accessed at home?<br/>\nMaybe this is a wake-up call to anyone on this list who has yet to *begin*<br/>\nthinking about their child as a sexual being. S/he is!  There is (in my not<br/>\nso humble opinion) no excuse for their sexual curiosity arriving as a<br/>\nSURPRISE!! OF COURSE, kids are curious! They tend (in my experience) to be<br/>\ncurious about *everything* about being a human being - sexuality included!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy human sexuality conversation started one day when Hannah was very young,<br/>\ncirca 2, and we were looking at pictures of our honeymoon at Disneyland.<br/>\nHannah wanted us to take her to Disneyland *right now* -- and I said, &quot;You<br/>\nwere there with me! You were an egg, waiting in line, hoping one day to<br/>\n*poof* turn into a little girl for us to take *back* to Disneyland.&quot;<br/>\nTalking about her potential babies always being with her, was a conversation<br/>\nwe continued, as it came up and as it expanded (i.e. Hayden is NOT carrying<br/>\nhis potential children with him his whole life), and even (especially) as<br/>\nshe began chemotherapy.  It seemed so flowing and natural.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I got private toileting moments until the last 2 years<br/>\n(hayden&#39;s now 10)... talking about Mommy&#39;s moon time is talking about human<br/>\nsexuality. It&#39;s really, really that simple to get started.<br/>\nThe Unitarian Universalists and the United Church of Christ got together a<br/>\ndecade or so ago and created a comprehensive sex ed curriculum K-Adult,<br/>\ncalled Our Whole Life<br/>\n(OWL&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uua.org/religiouseducation/curricula/ourwhole/\">http://www.uua.org/religiouseducation/curricula/ourwhole/</a>&gt;).<br/>\n[there is an optional spiritual component to this set, the information<br/>\nitself is not faith-based]  My kids didn&#39;t go to the program, I didn&#39;t want<br/>\nsexuality to be a CLASS, it was already like a nice thread throughout the<br/>\nweave of our life (as it truly is!), so I can&#39;t speak to being a parent of<br/>\nthe program. I can speak as a facilitator for the two levels of teen courses<br/>\n(11-14 & 15-18 roughly).  I was incredibly glad to have the opportunity to<br/>\nbe a resource for these kids, I was incredibly sad when I discovered for<br/>\nwhom I was their first resource. We talked - a lot - and that seems to be<br/>\nthe one thing that young humans want from the older ones - an opportunity to<br/>\n*have the conversation* - if not with you, then with another trusted adult<br/>\nin your life.<br/>\nThis was a common thread throughout the conversations I&#39;ve had with<br/>\nunschooled teens - &quot;Strew the info and find me a trusted someone to talk to<br/>\nabout it.&quot;  Sometimes (and sorry, it is rare) they&#39;re comfortable fully with<br/>\ntheir parents; the surprise to me was even the coolest parents in the world<br/>\nweren&#39;t the perfect fit to talk intimate details about sex with.

Sexual abuse, and yes, what<br/>\noccurred to your dh counts as such too, is so horrendous and can have<br/>\nfar-reaching implications.  I&#39;ve had so much therapy and am even a therapist<br/>\n(not actively) myself and I&#39;m still dealing with awful side effects from<br/>\nabuse.  I could go on a long rant, but it would probably be inappropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor you, I highly recommend a book by Wendy Maltz called &quot;The Sexual Healing<br/>\nJourney&quot;.  It may be out of print now, but I found it at my local library<br/>\n(actually at the one in my small town).  It really helped me to feel<br/>\nvalidated and to examine exactly what effects were still damaging me and<br/>\nwhich weren&#39;t.  I also highly recommend &quot;Protecting the Gift&quot; by Gavin de<br/>\nBecker to anyone with children.  He was also severely abused as a child and<br/>\nhas become a crusader for children.  He consults with the FBI on tracking<br/>\ndown internet predators, if I have that right.  Protect.org has lobbied to<br/>\nget laws through Congress to protect children from internet predators, which<br/>\nwould be beneficial to check out.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also wrote &quot;The Gift of Fear&quot; which I&#39;ve not yet read.  Protecting the<br/>\nGift really helps you come up with criteria for a lot of things.  He does a<br/>\nlot of emphasizing of the power of intuition.  That said, I still find<br/>\nmyself unsure as to whether my reaction is one of fear or one of intuition.<br/>\nI think that&#39;s what abuse does to you, it really distorts where the &quot;lines&quot;<br/>\nare.  So far, I&#39;m keeping my kids probably &quot;over-protected&quot;, still trying to<br/>\nsort it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all may sound unrelated to your situation, but I think it is very<br/>\nrelated.  If I understand correctly, you are essentially trying to discern<br/>\nif this is developmentally appropriate behavior and if so, how to support it<br/>\nwithin your comfort zone.  I&#39;m nearly positive that de Becker gives<br/>\nsuggestions on books, etc. for kids as well.  I know he links to a lot of<br/>\nprograms re: self-protection for kids (what used to be billed and still is,<br/>\nunfortunately, as &quot;stranger danger&quot; programs).<br/>\n<br/>\nLegality, and potential risks to him, particularly from internet predators<br/>\nwould be my two biggest concerns.

If you and your partner both have messy and hurtful histories around sexuality, you have to do the work to heal (counseling, books, etc) or you can&#39;t hope to model healthy sexual attitudes and behavior for your kids.  You&#39;re just passing along your own hurts down the line so they can deal with it later with their own kids.  If you choose to live in freak-out mode about sex (especially homophobic thoughts like &quot;I hope it&#39;s just girls&quot;), your son doesn&#39;t have to hear your words about it.  He&#39;ll simply know that you&#39;re uncomfortable and that you have emotional triggers around sex. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt 13, I was both fascinated and terrified by sex.  My parents weren&#39;t helpful at all in that we didn&#39;t have any open communication.  It was my job to follow the rules and &quot;be seen, not heard&quot;.  So my first real sexual knowledge came from Gwen, my first heavy crush.  She was 15, I was 13, and we went to a private Christian school together that year.  She was dating a football player, but she called me her Little Boyfriend, and at recess she would tell me all of the mechanical stuff about periods and intercourse and different sexual positions.  I had 1000 questions, and she had 1001 answers.  I had no interest in &quot;meeting girls my own age&quot;.  Like any other kid, I just wanted info.  More data!! (Number 5 is alive!).  It would have been much easier if I had had Google back in those days.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is only 3, but I&#39;ve already given a lot of thought to how we&#39;ll handle sexual discovery and exploration.  Most of my thoughts end with &quot;Breathe.  Relax.  Enjoy.&quot;  In the days after my daughter was born 3 months ago, and my wife and I were getting frisky one night, he informed us that, &quot;Mommy and daddy can&#39;t have sex yet.  We already have a baby here and I don’t want another one yet.&quot;  He watched mommy&#39;s belly get bigger throughout the pregnancy and had been constantly curious about how the baby had gotten in there, and we were matter-of-fact about it.  Daddy&#39;s penis goes into mommy&#39;s vagina while they&#39;re making love, and daddy&#39;s penis squirts in some seeds, just like planting a seed in the earth (we garden), and baby grows.  We answered all his questions, trying not to overload him.  But at this point he thinks that babies are made *every* time sex happens, I think.  It&#39;s a subject we&#39;ve only talked about in context, in the moment as he&#39;s asked about it, and it&#39;s an area where I struggle (due to my non-informative parents and my overcompensation for that) to not be &quot;Teacher-ly&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur behavior (in both children and adults) is simply communication about our inner life and needs.  So if my son&#39;s googling porn, I would think he&#39;s just communicating that he wants information, first, so I&#39;ll do whatever I can to help him get information.  Help him google!  And in addition to physical images of naked human bodies intertwined, he&#39;ll also have easy access to any of the David Deida books lying around my office to help answer questions about sexual spirituality (or spiritual sexuality, depending on how you think of it), and any other books I can find about puberty, body changes, etc.   -=b.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBrad in Boulder, CO<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://holcombs.org\">http://holcombs.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: porn issues","postDate":"1231442008","msgId":37707,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk1NDczNi40NzM5NS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIxMC5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":37692,"nextInTopic":37710,"prevInTime":37706,"nextInTime":37708,"topicId":37677,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Honestly the thing that would most worry me about Simon or Linnaea using the internet to look for porn would be the potential for viruses and legal issues.

It isn&#39;t something that I&#39;m shy or afraid of. If talked about the problem of the internet as the point of access for information about sex and for naked pictures with both Simon and Linnaea. Wikipedia has an article about the legality of internet pornography: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_Internet_pornography,\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_Internet_pornography,</a> which talks in interesting ways about the difficulty of holding an international medium to national or state laws as well as what is legal and what isn&#39;t in a few countries. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever unhealthy your relationship with sex was, and molestion, rape and near rape certainly could lead to a seriously unhealthy feeling about sex, it is perfectly healthy and normal for a 13 year old boy or girl to be interested in looking at naked pictures. It might help a lot if you get books for both of you about sex. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to someone concerned about her 9 year old son discovering internet porn, Diana Jenner wrote this: <br/>\nProof indeed that if *you* don&#39;t provide an atmosphere where sexuality is<br/>\ntreated as a holistic part of the human existence, your child will find the<br/>\nfolks who provide just the *sex* component of humanity.<br/>\nIf you need some impetus to have (an on-going, life-long) conversation about<br/>\nhuman sexuality, I recommend &quot;It&#39;s Perfectly<br/>\nNormal&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://search.a1books.com/cgi-bin/mktSearch?act=showDesc&code=gbase&rel=1&ITEM_CODE=1564021599\">http://search.a1books.com/cgi-bin/mktSearch?act=showDesc&code=gbase&rel=1&ITEM_CODE=1564021599</a>&gt;&quot;<br/>\n(available on line as low as $*.*25!!) -- even (maybe especially) to leave<br/>\non his bed, to read/look at/peruse at his leisure.<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure I have advice to the situation above, as it&#39;s truly beyond my<br/>\nimagination (a 9 year old without the info - not a judgment, just out of my<br/>\nrealm of experience)...<br/>\nI will ponder and chime in again to this conversation.<br/>\nFor anyone else who is not already having an ongoing dialogue with their<br/>\nchild (of ANY age) about human sexuality as a part of *Who We Are* begin<br/>\nNOW!!

I never asked why she had those. That was a really important book for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is normal to want to understand what sex is and to want to look at naked people. It is normal to be curious.
