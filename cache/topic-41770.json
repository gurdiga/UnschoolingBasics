Of course any of the states with no<br/>\nnotice requirements is great. Or just intent notice requirements.

I looked for groups on yahoo and other<br/>\nboards sites specific to each state and inquired of people who had<br/>\nexperience in each state.

A letter of intent sent school district to begin, keep a portfolio that may be subject to review, then every year you need to do one of the following (details may vary by county):<br/>\n<br/>\nOption 1.

The teacher must hold a valid regular Florida<br/>\nCertificate to teach academic subjects at the elementary or secondary level. A signed written<br/>\nreport completed by the certified teacher must be submitted to the superintendent. A copy of the<br/>\nevaluator&#39;s valid Florida teaching certificate must be attached to the report; or,<br/>\nOption 2. The student may take any nationally normed student achievement test used by the district and<br/>\nadministered by a certified teacher; or,<br/>\nOption 3. The student may take a state student assessment test administered by a certified teacher.<br/>\nPinellas County uses the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT); or,<br/>\nOption 4. The student may be evaluated by an individual holding a valid, active private psychologist&#39;s<br/>\nlicense; or,<br/>\nOption 5.
