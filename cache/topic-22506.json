The day the magazines <br/>\narrived was like Christmas for me!  I carry them around all day, from <br/>\nroom to room and grab a minute here and there to read the articles.  <br/>\nWow.  It&#39;s just so wonderful reading about other folks that think like I <br/>\ndo and have wonderful advice about the being the parent I&#39;m trying to <br/>\nbe.  Plus I&#39;ve spent tonight checking out various links from within the <br/>\nmag.  Naomi Aldort&#39;s website has wonderful articles to read and I just <br/>\nordered her book.  I can&#39;t read enough about unschooling and since my <br/>\nonline time is pretty hit or miss I cherish print on paper that I can <br/>\nread at the kitchen table or while nursing a baby.  I don&#39;t worry about <br/>\nthese ending up in the trash/recycle bin...I&#39;ll be holding on to these <br/>\nin my library :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust fyi,<br/>\nAmy in WV</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22500,"nextTopicId":22507}}
