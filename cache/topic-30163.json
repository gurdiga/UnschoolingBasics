I want it to be like that all the time, and yet it really appears like it&#39;s me that&#39;s getting in the way.  I&#39;m very frustrated with myself!!!  I am reverting back so often to coercion, trying to get them out the door, trying to get them to go to bed, not all the time, not with everything, but it&#39;s like I can be all flowy for a certain length of time and then, whoa, here&#39;s the mommy back who yells and demands and can&#39;t seem to handle yet another kitchen mess, and just isn&#39;t very nice to be around.  I am reading and talking and emailing and reading and talking and emailing some more.  I have met a fantastic group of unschooling mamas and their kids and we get together every week and email lots in between.  I am writing in my journal.  I am doing *so* many things and yet it doesn&#39;t seem to be enough.  Every night I am determined to do it<br/>\n differently tomorrow, and yet every night I go to bed with so much guilt and grief about how that part of me that is so unattractive showed up again.  My god, I feel like a drug addict that just can&#39;t stop!  I lasted about 12 minutes this morning after they got up before I was getting upset with them about something.  Clearly this is my own shit, and yet I have done *so* much work on this shit!!!  I&#39;m really not sure what else to do here.  Has anyone had this much challenge getting their own shit out of the way??  Can anyone shed any light on this???  Can anyone offer any other suggestions that I may not have tried yet???<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! Mobile.
