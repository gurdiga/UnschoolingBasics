When<br/>\nmy DH went on his current job, I didn&#39;t make sit-down meals when he wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthere, and my son loved it. He&#39;s just snack (good stuff, he eats healthier<br/>\nthan  I do!) all day. Then about six months ago, he wanted sit-down meals,<br/>\neven if it&#39;s only me and him.He was 16, is 17 now.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope his makes sense, I have a bad cold and headache. : )<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBrenda Potter Reynolds<br/>\nwww.bpreynolds.com<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.FingerLakesVacationGuide.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31654,"nextTopicId":31661}}
