What makes reading a toddler book to a child better than  <br/>\ntalking to them as we would talk to other people?  It certainly isn&#39;t any  <br/>\nmore <br/>\neducational than just talking about our real world with our  children.  &lt;&lt;&lt;,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s part of the &quot;surround the child with the printed word and  he <br/>\nwon&#39;t be able to *avoid* reading&quot; thang. The more words he sees, the better.  <br/>\nBut in most homes (unschooling homes, anyway) there are words everywhere. <br/>\nCan&#39;t  <br/>\nreally avoid it if you tried!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think much of the emphasis on reading to kids  comes from the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>schoolish idea that parents don&#39;t spend any other valuable time  with their <br/>\nkids, as <br/>\nif the only way to get parents to interact with kids is to  make them sit <br/>\ndown <br/>\nwith a book.  Sadly, this seems to be true for so many  people, who never <br/>\nlearned to talk to kids like sentient  beings&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re spot-on here. MAKING parents spend time with their  <br/>\nchildren----and this is the only way to get that to happen----threaten them <br/>\nwith  <br/>\nilliteracy! Sheesh!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh but my 5 year old LOVES being read to :)  I&#39;ve always loved reading <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and so has DH, so it seemed natural to read to Emma as soon as she was <br/>\ninterested.  It quickly became part of our bedtime routine...a sort of tradition, <br/>\ngetting all snuggly in our pjs...all in bed and reading a few good books.  Em loves <br/>\nit as much as we do, and gets quite upset if &#39;reading books&#39; is NOT part of <br/>\nour evening.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that may just be who she is.  She loves to make up stories, lyrics, etc. <br/>\nand has learned &#39;how&#39; to read on her own (she just turned 5).  I do think part <br/>\nof that is being exposed to all those interesting, funny, exciting stories in <br/>\nbooks.  Couple that with her being independent minded, it&#39;s made her want to <br/>\nlearn to read so SHE can read to US, and also be able to read books without <br/>\nasking us to read to her  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nDenise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2234,"nextTopicId":2258}}
