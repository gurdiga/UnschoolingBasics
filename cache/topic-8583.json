I<br/>\nwould like your input before we meet this Friday so that I can make <br/>\nsure that we<br/>\nhave some things to think about to make this a success on the front <br/>\nend.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you have the core idea layed out, I&#39;m sure it will <br/>\nbuild from there. I can only tell you what worked really well for <br/>\nme, each group operates in a unique way, but here&#39;s what we did:<br/>\n<br/>\nInitiallly, when we had a few unschooling families interested in <br/>\ngetting together regularly, we would meet at the park. We decided <br/>\nsomething weekly would be nice, so I looked around for a rec center <br/>\nand fortunately, the park we&#39;d been meeting at was happy to have us <br/>\nuse their rec center each week.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis opened up all sorts of possibilities, because we now had a <br/>\nbuilding. There was a large gym, and a couple of side rooms for <br/>\ngaming or crafts or??<br/>\nWe labeled the group clearly as NON-religious. We had quite a <br/>\ndiverse group over the years, religiously speaking...christians, <br/>\npagans, atheists, jews, catholic etc... It was really nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot everyone was unschoolers, but most everyone was very relaxed and <br/>\nleaned towards AP parenting styles. Anyone really uptight and <br/>\nreligious did not fit in well at all, and usually did not come back <br/>\nfor a second visit. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to check out the group I started in P&#39;cola, you can read <br/>\nabout them at the yahoo group Pensacolaunschoolers.  We had a lot of <br/>\nfun over the years. Activities were sometimes planned, but anyone <br/>\ncould choose to get involved or not...there was always a basketball <br/>\nand the park for anyone not wanting to do whatever was going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a medieval themed day, a huge &quot;Fun-fest&quot; with all sorts of <br/>\nvendors (not selling, just sharing a passion) from beekeepers, to <br/>\npigeon racers, museums etc..., we baked bread in a bag and made ice <br/>\ncream, we painted ceramics and for the most part, we hung out and <br/>\nmade new friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt drove the schoolish types crazy that we didn&#39;t have any schedule <br/>\nor &quot;structure&quot; other than the day we met....they wanted us to offer <br/>\nclasses and such. It was amusing.  Starting that group was one of <br/>\nthe best things I ever did, we made lifelong friends there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes on your adventure. Just get a clear vision of the type <br/>\nof group you want it to be, write that up and then there won&#39;t be <br/>\nany confusion when folks want to participate. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8591,"nextTopicId":8574}}
