I think we can each<br/>\narrive at a truth that resonates with us in varying forms.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with what you posted. I think it could be expanded upon<br/>\ntoo....it&#39;s very connected to the idea of non-attachment. Practicing<br/>\nchoiceless awareness is basically saying (to me) that if we are OPEN,<br/>\nyet AWARE, our preferences and preconceived notions won&#39;t get in the<br/>\nway of the moment.  It&#39;s letting go on so many levels. In the<br/>\nnon-attachment/choiceless awareness/no preference paradiagm, we can<br/>\nsimply take in information and be open to experiencing it fully.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that state, we aren&#39;t judging everything constantly (ugly, bad,<br/>\ngood, yucky, beautiful etc...) we&#39;re simply BEING in the moment,<br/>\ntrying to experience it all and being open to learning/enjoyment etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in that place of clear seeing, we can actually &quot;enjoy&quot; the<br/>\ndifficult moments. It allows us to be aware that although we&#39;re<br/>\npassing through an experience we may not care for (letting go of the<br/>\npreconceived idea that it&#39;s a bad/rough moment) we are ALIVE, we are<br/>\nfeeling it, we are fully THERE.
