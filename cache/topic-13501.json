I<br/>\nwent through this same feeling, that I had caused my dd to have a nightmare,<br/>\naround the same age.  When she was about 18 mo we watched the Scooby Doo<br/>\nmovie, the one with the electrical monster.  The monster scared her, so we<br/>\nfast forwarded past it.  That night for the first and only time in 2 1/2<br/>\nyrs. she woke up screaming.  Now it could be coincidence, but I still really<br/>\nbelieve that that movie caused her to have a nightmare.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not limiting TV doesn&#39;t mean having a kid watch whatever is on.

It<br/>\nmeans helping him watch what he wants and being right there with him to<br/>\nexplain what&#39;s happening or to talk about why certain characters have<br/>\nacted in a certain way.   It means using discretion about what we watch<br/>\nwhen our kids are around if we suspect certain things might be<br/>\ndisturbing.    Not limiting what they *want* to watch doesn&#39;t mean making<br/>\nthem watch everything.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree with this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMisty</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1010,"nextTopicId":13366}}
