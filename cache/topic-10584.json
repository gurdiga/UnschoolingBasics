Did she have anything worth pondering to offer you?<br/>\n@@@@@<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we were leaving from my house (she met me at my house) the kids were into<br/>\nthe music and making faces at my DD (14 months). The other mother was<br/>\nclearly irritated - not talking but doing a lot of sighing. I said, &quot;What&#39;s<br/>\nwrong?&quot; At this point I didn&#39;t even know I had done anything wrong, I spend<br/>\na lot of time with other families and it is nothing for me to help get<br/>\nbreakfast served, getting dressed or whatever and discipline (after I<br/>\ndescribe someone help me with a better word here).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I say discipline, I don&#39;t mean hitting, screaming or even punishment of<br/>\nany kind. It isn&#39;t about getting in trouble. Like my DD was on my son&#39;s bed<br/>\nand she hurt her head when I walked in he was rubbing her head so hard he<br/>\nwas almost shaking her head. He didn&#39;t hurt her but I said stop a little on<br/>\nthe loud side and we sat on the bed and talked about why that wasn&#39;t a good<br/>\nidea and how to do better next time. When I see someone&#39;s child doing<br/>\nsomething dangerous or just see some where I can help I do without<br/>\nhesitation. So directing her daughter to get her seat belt on wasn&#39;t unusual<br/>\nfor me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, she responds, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you forced S to wear her seatbelt.&quot; I<br/>\ntold her that I was sorry but that is a rule in my car and adult or child.<br/>\nWe always wear our seat belt when the car is moving.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe responded with, &quot;You and rules, You&#39;ll never be an unschooler if you use<br/>\nrules.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to explain that while I may not use the correct verbage my son<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t see it as a rule. He sees it as something you do to be safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe told me she never forces her DD to do anything and that includes putting<br/>\non her seatbelt and that I violated her parental rights as an unschooler by<br/>\nforcing her to buckle her seatbelt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to defend myself by discussing that children are required by law to<br/>\nbe in a booster seat until age 8 and 80 lbs and she told me that<br/>\nvaccinations were a legal requirement in Maryland too but she doesn&#39;t do<br/>\nthose either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know for a fact if vaccinations are a legal requirement or not... My<br/>\nchildren do receive their vaccinations but at the latest suggested dates and<br/>\nmy doctor&#39;s office even puts those off. I told her that my children receive<br/>\nvaccinations though I don&#39;t know what that has to do with buckling your seat<br/>\nbelt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told her I was sorry if she felt that I invaded the way she raises her DD.<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t want anyone to do to me. My son often takes direction from other<br/>\nadults but knows that no one has the right to touch him or hurt him. We get<br/>\ntogether with many families in their home and he knows that everyone&#39;s home<br/>\nworks differently. Some only allow eating in the kitchen, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, of accepting my apology or letting the matter drop she attacked my<br/>\nunschooling methods. I just bought my son math-u-see&#39;s first set because one<br/>\nof my son&#39;s friend&#39;s use it (they use it for homeschooling - more eclectic<br/>\nthey have to do something educational daily but the kids get to pick it) My<br/>\nDS really likes it and asked for it. I asked him if he just wanted the<br/>\nblocks and he told me no he wanted to do it the same way as J does it. J&#39;s<br/>\nmother had asked me before if they did stuff could my DS be included and I<br/>\nsaid as long as he was interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo since we had got taxes back I ordered the first set and the other mother<br/>\ntold me that it was too schooly and I never should have gotten it for him<br/>\neven though he asked me for it. That I had to protect him from schooly stuff<br/>\nand schooly friends. She ranted about my use of workbooks (Kumon cutting,<br/>\ntracing, hand writing again stuff he has seen and asked for). That I had<br/>\nmentioned setting up time on the computer for him to play his games<br/>\n(everything from Putt-Putt to Arthur 1st Grade) all ones he has picked<br/>\nhimself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked her, I admit my temper was starting to flair a little, that I need<br/>\nto protect my son from  schooly stuff but not to protect himself from injury<br/>\nby wearing his seatbelt? She just looked at me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen then (within second) arrived at our destination... she ripped her<br/>\ndaughter out of the car so fast that she started to cry and before I left, I<br/>\nwas looking for her and was told she rode home with someone else. I have<br/>\nthought about calling her but I don&#39;t know what to even say.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\nMelaleuca Customer<br/>\n <br/>\nJoin our club and swap paperback books for FREE - PaperBackSwap.com<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mfhickman@...\">mfhickman@...</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, March 10, 2006 12:07 PM<br/>\nTo: unschooling basics<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: saftey issues<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to ask a few questions about this. First, you said the mom was mad<br/>\nat you for forcing her dd to wear a setbelt, but no where do I hear you used<br/>\nforce. I see you insisted on her dd being safe in your car and you being the<br/>\nresponsible driver. This mom has a problem in my mind if she is mad at you.<br/>\nSo did you use force , like in put the seat belt on the child, or did you<br/>\ninsist? Also, I would like to hear more about what the mom said, what were<br/>\nher points? Did she have anything worth pondering to offer you?<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a child who has taken to wanted to be unbuckled. It&#39;s a very tough<br/>\none for me, because she is independently buckling herself, she is 6 now, and<br/>\nfor what ever reason, she likes to unbuckle just for the sake, for a game of<br/>\nsorts. I have been impatient, yuck. I have pulled over and waited. I have<br/>\ndecided not to go somewhere. All along we talk, talk, talk, about why we<br/>\nbuckle, how she could get hurt, what the law is, how I could get a big<br/>\nticket. That being said, she is 6, and she reacts as a 6 year old, full of<br/>\nspunk and silliness. We have never been in an accident, I have shown her the<br/>\nmomentum when stopping. But, all along, I continue to ask for her to buckle,<br/>\nI calmly (most of the time) wait for her to comply, and then we go. I have<br/>\nused force, in the yes I am buckling you right now I am late to pick your<br/>\nsister up, and though that gets the goal of a buckled child, it also breaks<br/>\ndown her trust with me. I apologize, life continues, I voice my frustrations<br/>\nto her so she can see where I am at on this. I could just let it go, but<br/>\nthat is not what I want to model. Buckling is important to me. As the driver<br/>\nI require all passangers to be buckled.

First, you said the mom was mad at you for forcing her dd to wear a setbelt, but no where do I hear you used force. I see you insisted on her dd being safe in your car and you being the responsible driver. This mom has a problem in my mind if she is mad at you.  So did you use force , like in put the seat belt on the child, or did you insist? Also, I would like to hear more about what the mom said, what were her points? Did she have anything worth pondering to offer you?<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a child who has taken to wanted to be unbuckled. It&#39;s a very tough one for me, because she is independently buckling herself, she is 6 now, and for what ever reason, she likes to unbuckle just for the sake, for a game of sorts. I have been impatient, yuck. I have pulled over and waited. I have decided not to go somewhere. All along we talk, talk, talk, about why we buckle, how she could get hurt, what the law is, how I could get a big ticket. That being said, she is 6, and she reacts as a 6 year old, full of spunk and silliness. We have never been in an accident, I have shown her the momentum when stopping. But, all along, I continue to ask for her to buckle, I calmly (most of the time) wait for her to comply, and then we go. I have used force, in the yes I am buckling you right now I am late to pick your sister up, and though that gets the goal of a buckled child, it also breaks down her trust with me.
