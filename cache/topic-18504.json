Deb, I will be keeping the questions you asked<br/>\nme on a card in my wallet so, that I can remind myself<br/>\nof them. Maybe that will help keep the frustration<br/>\ndown. <br/>\n<br/>\nMarji said So, when he goes into a silent period, see<br/>\nif you can take a deep breath, find the thing about<br/>\nhim you love most and get in touch with that which<br/>\nmakes you feel joyful inside, and then *work* with him<br/>\nin a joyful way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis made me cry.

All we know that you are being driven crazy and <br/>\nthat you get mad because you son refuses to speak.  We don&#39;t <br/>\nwhat his demeanor is or even if he&#39;s 2 years old or 12 years old.  <br/>\nThat information is kind of important.  Is he angrily refusing to <br/>\nspeak, or is this fun for him but not for you.  Is it that he never <br/>\nspeaks or is he only refusing to speak at certain times?  If so, can <br/>\nyou find a common trigger for his silent periods?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s a really little guy, perhaps he is intimidated and <br/>\nuncomfortable or feeling judged.  If so, your getting angry with <br/>\nhim can&#39;t possibly help (but I&#39;m sure you know this).   It has <br/>\nalways helped me to remember that I&#39;ve got 38 years on my son, <br/>\nand accordingly, I had better life skills than he did when he was <br/>\nreally young (he&#39;s impressive now at nearly 12 years of age, <br/>\nthough, I must say).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, because I had that advantage, I felt like the onus was <br/>\nreally on me to be more emotionally mature than I would expect <br/>\nhim to be.  Not that I didn&#39;t permit myself to feel frustration or <br/>\nanger, but that I would *deal* with it in a way that reduced its <br/>\nimpact on him.  Know what I mean?  I remember being a little <br/>\nperson dealing with a big angry person, and that can be scary!!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might consider visiting Sandra Dodd&#39;s website <br/>\n(www.sandradodd.com) and finding the section on Peaceful <br/>\nParenting.  She&#39;s got a tape about Peaceful Parenting, and it&#39;s <br/>\nreally, really, really wonderful!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that whatever the reason for his silence, you need to <br/>\nremember that you cannot control him.  You can only control <br/>\nyourself ~ and your reactions.  So, when he goes into a silent <br/>\nperiod, see if you can take a deep breath, find the thing about <br/>\nhim you love most and get in touch with that which makes you <br/>\nfeel joyful inside, and then *work* with him in a joyful way.  Turn <br/>\nit into a game of charades.  See how long you both can go <br/>\nwithout uttering a word.  Embrace him and his silence.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s been enduring your wrath over this, you may find that an <br/>\nabrupt change in your attitude will be such a huge relief for him <br/>\nthat you both can move to a new and wonderful place in your <br/>\nrelationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I hope this has helped a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a link to that Sandra Dodd page I was telling you about, <br/>\nand there&#39;s a link on the page for her tape.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/peacefulparenting\">http://sandradodd.com/peacefulparenting</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nMarji</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":174410770,"authorName":"D Smith","from":"D Smith &lt;sandshuse@...&gt;","profile":"sandshuse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"using words","postDate":"1161563313","msgId":18509,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYxMDIzMDAyODMzLjE1MzY0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyOTA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEEzNjY3NTVDLUJGOEUtNEUxNC1BREFDLUE0M0RDNTNBNjdEMUB1bmVyem9nZW4uZGU+"},"prevInTopic":18507,"nextInTopic":18510,"prevInTime":18508,"nextInTime":18510,"topicId":18504,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Since this little thing is driving me crazy, I ve decided to finally ask for help because nothing has helped.

We do get paid for going to work and if we choose  to <br/>\nvolunteer our time, we are getting back an emotional reward.  If we  choose to <br/>\ntidy up a room, we get a tidy room.

This shift in thought  might have a huge impact on the <br/>\nchild&#39;s response to you.

Searching in  <br/>\nthe archives a bit (not about manipulation but other things), I have  <br/>\noften found suggestions that seemed &quot;manipulative&quot; (though not really  <br/>\n&quot;mean&quot;), when people were trying to find solutions other than  <br/>\npunishment etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, suggesting you go eat an ice cream after/before some  <br/>\nactivity the child doesn&#39;t really want to go, but was promised to the  <br/>\nsisters. It doesn&#39;t really feel &quot;mean&quot; to me, but I still don&#39;t know  <br/>\nwere you draw the line (if you draw a line) between persuation and  <br/>\nmanipulation or .... manipulation and just &quot;being thankful that your  <br/>\nchild gave you some of his valuable time to complete a &#39;needed&#39; task&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking about it, this issue only applies to younger children  <br/>\n(toddlers). I can tell my 7-year old that we could eat ice cream  <br/>\nafter going to the bank, but she can really understand that this is  <br/>\nnot an arbitrary reward, but that I&#39;m just thankful and want to do  <br/>\nsomething nice after doing something boring, plus she can just stay  <br/>\nat home if she doesn&#39;t want to go and in general it seems a lot  <br/>\neasier to find other solutions. But if I tell this to a say 2-year  <br/>\nold or 3-year old, I *know* he doesn&#39;t really know what it means to  <br/>\ngo the bank, stay there sitting still or having nothing to do, being  <br/>\nbored and so on, and it feels like &quot;betraying&quot; him if I say things  <br/>\nlike &quot;afterwards we can go eat ice cream&quot;, and it may feel arbitrary  <br/>\naswell(?).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a bit confused about this and would like to read your thoughts on  <br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nUnerzogen! | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dialog@...\">dialog@...</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unerzogen.de\">http://www.unerzogen.de</a> |  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unerzogen-subscribe@...\">unerzogen-subscribe@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18534,"nextTopicId":18562}}
