The mainstream belief about a well-rounded <br/>\nK-12 education assumes that, at some point, every student needs to <br/>\nlearn algebra Â… and there&#39;s no way to imagine that trigonometry et. <br/>\nal. will be organically encountered the way, for instance, geography, <br/>\nhistory, and semi-colons might come to be stumbled upon along an <br/>\nunschooly path.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Before I get too far along my musings about whether or not <br/>\ncurriculized mathematics are necessary, and later, how functional <br/>\nmathematics occur organically in life anyway, I must pause to <br/>\ncelebrate Paul Lockhart&#39;s A Mathematician&#39;s Lament .  This essay Â– <br/>\nbesides being my new favourite must-read recommendation for <br/>\nunschoolers and, well, anyone with a pulse Â– is a brilliant exposÃ© <br/>\nlamenting the pedantic and incongruous way mathematics has been <br/>\ndissected into particulate bits of formulas and &quot;a senseless <br/>\nbouillabaisse of disconnected topics&quot;.  Lockhart&#39;s devotion to <br/>\nthe &quot;breathtaking depth and heartbreaking beauty in this ancient art <br/>\nform&quot; exalts mathematics as a fine art the way only a truly <br/>\nimpassioned connoisseur could.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;He says it is &quot;ironic that people dismiss mathematics as the <br/>\nantithesis of creativity.  They are missing out on an art form older <br/>\nthan any book, more profound than any poem, and more abstract than <br/>\nany abstract.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;&quot;And,&quot; he emphasizes, &quot;It is school (emphasis his) that has done <br/>\nthis!  What a sad endless cycle of innocent teachers inflicting <br/>\ndamage upon innocent students.  We could all be having so much more <br/>\nfun.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;While my premise herein might could be a questioning of whether <br/>\nsophisticated mathematics principles warrant the attention of every K-<br/>\n12-aged person, Lockhart&#39;s thesis is that mathematics are eloquent <br/>\nexpressions of creative possibility.  Not unlike musical composition, <br/>\nor fine art painting.  And that subjugating students into indentured <br/>\nservitude to Mathematic Programs of Study is as stifling as it is <br/>\ntragic.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n... and the chapter goes on from there ...<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to shy away from the &quot;But what about math&quot; wonderings most <br/>\nskeptics of unschooling spar with.  Because I was uncertain <br/>\nmyself ... what ABOUT math?  Now I&#39;m to the point that the &quot;But what <br/>\nabout math&quot; question is one of my preferred soapboxes.  It&#39;s just <br/>\nridiculous to imagine that every human being needs to know <br/>\npythagorus&#39; theory ... or any of the other formulaic bits that are <br/>\npoured into us in the school system&#39;s jug and mug approach to <br/>\nteaching/learning.  Now, thanks to Lockhart&#39;s essay, I not only think <br/>\nit&#39;s ridiculous to subjugate every unique individual to a single <br/>\nstatic Program of Studies, I also think it&#39;s an abomination to have <br/>\nthe art of mathematics bastardized the way it is in schools.  I&#39;d be <br/>\nas offended if music was deconstructed and systematically forced onto <br/>\nevery single student.<br/>\n<br/>\nHurrah for unschooling liberty!<br/>\n<br/>\nloving,<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<br/>\nHost of Alphabet Soup:  2009 Calgary Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alphabetsoupconference.com/\">http://www.alphabetsoupconference.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlphabetSoupConference/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlphabetSoupConference/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Memorizing math facts is one of the &quot;worst&quot; ways to learn math and<br/>\n&gt; only encourages those that understand numbers and memorize well. <br/>\n&gt; Most kids do not function that way.<br/>\n  <br/>\n&gt; This is probably, in my opinion, the area that we get the most<br/>\n&gt; grief from non-unschoolers about.

We have a great group in Miami with<br/>\na mix of home and unschoolers and also one in Fort Lauderdale.<br/>\nIf I can help you with anything please let me know :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Lori&quot; &lt;LMBWebmail@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just want to thank everyone who responded with compassion, great <br/>\n&gt; ideas and support.

He naturally leans that way, but just because we unschool doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t use traditional curriculum when it is child-directed.  I went on the internet and evaluated several options and talked (a little - he&#39;s 8 remember) about what they entail.  Now, we use RightStart Mathematics and he LOVES it.  It is very untraditional, uses an abacus and word pictures, and he asks to do it at least 3 times a week.  Obviously, this costs money and isn&#39;t in everyone&#39;s budget, but it is the only &quot;curriculum&quot; thing that we use and it is by his choice.  If no other child shows interest we will sell it on eBay or something because it has a high value.<br/>\nOn another note, we have never pushed math and he is naturally trying to work things out in his head and on a calculator.  Because we don&#39;t believe in pushing them in a direction, even though everyone around us disagrees, my 5 yo has now become interested in math.  He came to me last week and informed me that 3+2=5 and so does 4+1.  We talked about math for about 10 minutes and did different word problems that he was enjoying but after 10 minutes his interest faded, so we stopped.  Now, about every day, he asks one or two math related questions and is loving it.  I know if he were in the school he would be sick of it by now.  Memorizing math facts is one of the &quot;worst&quot; ways to learn math and only encourages those that understand numbers and memorize well.  Most kids do not function that way.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is probably, in my opinion, the area that we get the most grief from non-unschoolers about.  They say, &quot;How are they going to learn their math facts?&quot;  I kindly point out that there are other ways to learn math that apply to life and we capitalize on these when the kids are interested.<br/>\n <br/>\nHeather in Ohio<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.comFrom\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.comFrom</a>: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meredith@...\">meredith@...</a>: Sat, 14 Feb 2009 16:34:25 +0000Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re:Help!

My husband is all for this except he thinks they &gt; should do times tables..lol..I am sure you have heard that before. It sounds like he&#39;s thinking they won&#39;t ever have any interest in learning about multiplication on their own. The younger children almost certainly will if they aren&#39;t ever pushed to learn it - its useful, after all, and kids are naturally motivated to learn things that are useful and helpful. Its also fun for many many children to play with numbers and the patterns they form. If the older kids have been pushed to learn some &quot;math&quot; they may be less enthusiastic for awhile - but even that will fade with some deschooling. My 15yo hated anything that seemed &quot;schoolish&quot; for a long time after he left school, but nowadays he does a good bit with numbers. He does some woodworking, metalworking and working for cash ;) so various kinds of mathematics have become practical to him.Something to keep in mind with math is that the sequence its generally taught - in schools and most curricula - isn&#39;t necessarily the sequence in which children naturally become interested in and learn those concepts. An example that&#39;s fresh in my mind, from chatting with another mom yesterday, is that its not necessary to learn basic addition and subtraction before multiplication and/or division. &gt; Hubby and I are going to talk again today and try to make a decision &gt; about unschooling. If do something like give it a try, any &gt; suggestions on how long is a reasonable length of time to fairly try &gt; it...I don&#39;t want to not give it enough time as I think that may be &gt; unfair as I have read about deschooling and I am assuming this &gt; process is different for each individual. Does six months sound like &gt; a fair amount of time to try it out?Six months from now takes you to the start of the next &quot;school year&quot;. That&#39;s setting yourself up in the worst possible way - there&#39;s a delicate transition that will happen the first time you cross that magic line in your expectations between &quot;summer vacation&quot; and &quot;school time&quot;. Its not uncommon to feel a little panicky right around then, especially since mom and dad will still be deschooling. Give it all the next &quot;school year&quot; at least. Spend the first six months connecting more deeply with the kids, have fun together! And at the same time, do more reading about unschooling and, if you like that sort of thing, about learning and cognition in general. If you need goals, set some for yourself - read about different communication styles or Love Languages, or ways to facilitate problem solving. If you feel a need to &quot;keep track&quot; in some way (or maybe dh does) create a portfolio of some kind - a blog, perhaps, or a photo album or a journal - include pictures and stories from the day, but don&#39;t put any emphasis on &quot;learning&quot;. Emphasize &quot;this was fun&quot; and &quot;this is how we found a solution together&quot; and &quot;this is how I&#39;m becoming a kinder parent.&quot; Encourage dh to do the same, so you can connect better with each other about your days and experiences with the kids, especially if you&#39;re not often home at the same times.Think and talk about your core values/ guiding principles. Work on living by those principles - not &quot;applying&quot; them to the kids, but as a guide for how you, personally make decisions. ---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nWindows Liveï¿½: Keep your life in sync. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://windowslive.com/howitworks?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_WL_t1_allup_howitworks_022009\">http://windowslive.com/howitworks?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_WL_t1_allup_howitworks_022009</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":367169565,"authorName":"Melissa Gray","from":"Melissa Gray &lt;melissagr8@...&gt;","profile":"graymamacita","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:Help!

My 15yo hated anything that seemed &quot;schoolish&quot; for a <br/>\nlong time after he left school, but nowadays he does a good bit with <br/>\nnumbers. He does some woodworking, metalworking and working for <br/>\ncash ;) so various kinds of mathematics have become practical to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething to keep in mind with math is that the sequence its <br/>\ngenerally taught - in schools and most curricula - isn&#39;t necessarily <br/>\nthe sequence in which children naturally become interested in and <br/>\nlearn those concepts. An example that&#39;s fresh in my mind, from <br/>\nchatting with another mom yesterday, is that its not necessary to <br/>\nlearn basic addition and subtraction before multiplication and/or <br/>\ndivision. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hubby and I are going to talk again today and try to make a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>decision <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; about unschooling.

Its not uncommon to feel a little panicky right around then, <br/>\nespecially since mom and dad will still be deschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGive it all the next &quot;school year&quot; at least. Spend the first six <br/>\nmonths connecting more deeply with the kids, have fun together! And <br/>\nat the same time, do more reading about unschooling and, if you like <br/>\nthat sort of thing, about learning and cognition in general. If you <br/>\nneed goals, set some for yourself - read about different <br/>\ncommunication styles or Love Languages, or ways to facilitate problem <br/>\nsolving. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you feel a need to &quot;keep track&quot; in some way (or maybe dh does) <br/>\ncreate a portfolio of some kind - a blog, perhaps, or a photo album <br/>\nor a journal - include pictures and stories from the day, but don&#39;t <br/>\nput any emphasis on &quot;learning&quot;. Emphasize &quot;this was fun&quot; and &quot;this is <br/>\nhow we found a solution together&quot; and &quot;this is how I&#39;m becoming a <br/>\nkinder parent.&quot; Encourage dh to do the same, so you can connect <br/>\nbetter with each other about your days and experiences with the kids, <br/>\nespecially if you&#39;re not often home at the same times.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink and talk about your core values/ guiding principles. Work on <br/>\nliving by those principles - not &quot;applying&quot; them to the kids, but as <br/>\na guide for how you, personally make decisions. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":367169565,"authorName":"Melissa Gray","from":"Melissa Gray &lt;melissagr8@...&gt;","profile":"graymamacita","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:Help!

HOW you &quot;homeschool&quot; is irrelevant to them. There are TONS of unschoolers in CT simply because it is sooooo easy - no tests, no portfolios, no Notice of Intent required. There&#39;s a whole yahoo group of unschoolers even (TribeUSCT - Tribe of Unschoolers in CT). We&#39;ve been unschooling in CT since DS was 18 months old (That&#39;s when we moved back up here again after DH graduated college). He&#39;s now 10 Â½. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you don&#39;t need to &quot;get back&quot; years - what someone needs to know/learn can be learned when they need it. You don&#39;t need to spend 12 years on math - you can learn all of it from scratch (and few people are ever really at &quot;scratch&quot;) in a year, maybe less, if you WANT to and NEED to in order to reach your own goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nRe-evaluate what you consider &quot;Resources&quot; - text books, museums, expensive curricula are NOT necessary. Dried beans, paper clips, the Internet (which I KNOW you have LOL), media of all sorts (Libraries are FREE) - those are all resources. So is the next door neighbor and a whole host of homeschooling and unschooling families around the state. Don&#39;t forget things like Freecycle, the library, the Internet, bartering, etc as ways to access resources as well. For instance, someone on the CT-CHEER (CT Home Educators East of the River) Yahoo group posted that she was looking for a toy that she couldn&#39;t remember the name of but gave a description. Someone else said &quot;Oh, that&#39;s called Gears Gears Gears...&quot; At which point, I said &quot;Hey, we&#39;ve got that and it&#39;s in the pile of stuff we&#39;re getting rid of - do you want it?&quot; This family got a full set, new to them, gently used, for the cost of meeting us halfway to pick it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSet priorities - yeah, keeping the bookwork for a business is important but can it be &quot;maintained&quot; in 30 minutes while the kids are watching a movie or otherwise occupied (maybe when the littlest ones are asleep)? Cooking and cleaning can be done such that the kids can be involved (not forcibly but as in &quot;hey I&#39;m going to be folding laundry, anyone want to watch a movie with me while I work?&quot; ) Clean in 15 minute increments in between other things. Cook once a week and reheat the rest of the week. For instance, instead of cooking chicken two nights (at the 30 minutes or so that takes each time), cook a dozen chicken breasts at once then stash 2/3 of them. Voila, 5 minutes to heat up the chicken later on in the week and you&#39;ve got the makings for a stir fry. For that matter, how do you find the time to sit-down textbook school 4 kids AND do all this other stuff? Unschooling is more AND less time consuming than that stuff. Use the time you currently are setting aside for the sit down work (lesson planning, correcting work, doing lessons, etc). It might well be worthwhile to consider things like Peapod grocery delivery - you place the order online, set the delivery time window (usually a 2 hour window like 8 am - 10 am), they bring it right in to the kitchen table, you can use coupons and other discounts and pay by cash or check or credit card as you choose (you&#39;re not limited as to how to pay so you can write a check just as if you were at the store). The delivery charge compared to the value of your time may be worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSet financial priorities as well (not that that is news to you) - take the textbook money that you are already spending and put it toward whatever stuff they WANT to do. Memberships to things like the aquarium, children&#39;s museum, etc are GREAT holiday gifts from family (makes them feel like they&#39;re doing something &quot;educational&quot; for the kids and that&#39;s a Good Thing LOL). Magazine subscriptions too are a great gift, can be targeted to individual interests, include &quot;reading&quot; and other &quot;educational&quot; stuff like that - aunties and grandmas can feel good that they&#39;re &quot;helping&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

My son&#39;s passion is to do manly things..he is 8..He has been helping my neighor a carpenter put up fencing here and building things..he loves that and can measure and do math that has to do with roofing, all due to him going to work with my neighbor! He is learning, all be it not what a typical schooledÂ  8 yr old learns, but what interests him.<br/>\n<br/>\nÂ Really check out FL before you move there. They pay way less than most states and it is getting bad for gangs etc..I am from Orlando..my older son goes to college there and my parents and siblings live in Central FL. (Oveido, Winter Haven, Winter Park) It is getting rough there with a murder every day or so in Orlando! It is very much turning into New York... Just do your research and line up a job first as the pay is WAY low compared to the North. Just a heads up..My older son went to Winter Park High school in Winter Park FL and told me of the horrors of the gangs even in that school which was SUPPOSED to be one of the better ones...Winter Park is a NICE area...so just do your research before you move.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not let $ stress you out...You can survive on alot less than you know! I am living proof.. I used to have the #1 Middle Eastern Restaurant in Central FL and lived very well..now I feel I live very well but am seriously poor on the $ scales you read about! I have my horses etc and we do just fine, lean living is not that bad so do not let $ scare you. You will be surprised at how you adapt! This year I am planting a garden, raising my chicken eggs etc.I have 35 acres..LOL Good luck to you and do what you think is correct for unschooling..read read read and you will feel better about it like I did! :) Pam <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Tue, 2/10/09, Lori &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LMBWebmail@...\">LMBWebmail@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Lori &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LMBWebmail@...\">LMBWebmail@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Help!

I live in Connecticut and my husband<br/>\n<br/>\nand I work opposite each other so we can be home with our children. I<br/>\n<br/>\nwork two 10 hour shifts each week and he is self employed and works on<br/>\n<br/>\nthe days I am off. When he does not have work I will pick up extra at<br/>\n<br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe currently do an eclectic type of cirruculum with the kids. Math from<br/>\n<br/>\nhere, language from there..etc. I think they are learning from some of<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat they are doing but not from everything they are doing. I guess I<br/>\n<br/>\nfeel some of what they are doing is a waste of time for them because<br/>\n<br/>\nthey are not learning from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my core I believe unschooling is the best way to learn. I am just<br/>\n<br/>\nafraid of the following and hoped some of the seasoned unschoolers out<br/>\n<br/>\nthere could give me some advice that would maybe ease my mind so we<br/>\n<br/>\ncould try unschooling. Ok here is my not all inclusive list of fears...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1. With four kids and working opposite each other, and money issues my<br/>\n<br/>\nhusband and I are a bit stressed to say the least. I am worried that<br/>\n<br/>\neither of us will not have the time to foster what each of their<br/>\n<br/>\ninterests are as there are four of them and only one of us at a time and<br/>\n<br/>\nwe have no family support. When we are home there is so much to be done<br/>\n<br/>\nthat I feel to unschool effectively you need to have alot of extra time<br/>\n<br/>\nto devote to your kids passions. Please don&#39;t get me wrong it is not<br/>\n<br/>\nthat we don&#39;t want to have the extra time the reality is that very often<br/>\n<br/>\nthere is just many other things to do ie, cooking, cleaning, laundry,<br/>\n<br/>\nshopping, paying bills, bookwork for the business etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2. We have no extra money to buy resources for them to persue their<br/>\n<br/>\npassions. There are many things they would like to do (places to go) or<br/>\n<br/>\nbuy and we just don&#39;t have the finances to do this for them. I just feel<br/>\n<br/>\nlike if we can&#39;t provide these things for them they will not be able to<br/>\n<br/>\nlearn the things they could if we were able to provide more for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3. What if they don&#39;t learn...there is no turning back...I can&#39;t get<br/>\n<br/>\nthose years back for them...what if they are disadvantaged for life. I<br/>\n<br/>\nbelieve if they had the resources (see #2) they could learn but without<br/>\n<br/>\nthem I am not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Can the state penilize you for unschooling. We live in Connecticut<br/>\n<br/>\nfor now...(thinking about relocating to Florida)...CT is very easy on<br/>\n<br/>\nhomeschooling but I still worry if it gets out that we unschool that we<br/>\n<br/>\ncould get in trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that is bascially it...time, money, big brother and once commited not<br/>\n<br/>\ngetting the years back if it doesn&#39;t work...those are my main<br/>\n<br/>\nfears...Side note...I have anxiety issues so if these seem unrealistic<br/>\n<br/>\nthey may be..I tend to worry about EVERYTHING!! !<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would love any personal stories, words of encouragement, helpful<br/>\n<br/>\nhints or anything that may help me so I could do what I really want to<br/>\n<br/>\ndo in my heart. Unschooling makes sense to me, it feels right...I just<br/>\n<br/>\nhave to get past these fears and have some peace and then I think we<br/>\n<br/>\nwould be okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to babble...

How you do that is going to be <br/>\nreally different across ages and personalities, though. Some of it <br/>\nwill be one-on-one - working on a project together, watching a movie <br/>\ntogether, cooking together... but some of that will also happen in <br/>\nthe natural course of interacting as a family. When you make an <br/>\neffort to stay connected with your kids you&#39;ll find you have a good <br/>\nsense of what their interests and passions are - that will let you <br/>\nkeep an eye open for ideas along the way. I&#39;m not saying its a <br/>\npassive process, but it doesn&#39;t have to be some huge &quot;special&quot; effort <br/>\nof time and energy, either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2.

It takes some creativity to <br/>\nfind ways for our kids to persue their interests that we can afford. <br/>\nNetworking with others is one of our best resources - single adults, <br/>\nchildless couples, families with kids in school and at home, anyone <br/>\nat all can turn out to be a resource. Ask others what they do for <br/>\nfun! That can be enough, at times, to open a door or just spark a new <br/>\nidea.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are some of your kids&#39; interests? Maybe someone right here on <br/>\nthis board can help you brainstorm!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. What if they don&#39;t learn...there is no turning back...I can&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; those years back for them...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t learn what? That sounds snarky, but its meant seriously - <br/>\nexactly what do they need to learn? How do you know?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times when I feel horribly disadvantaged by my education... <br/>\nI was such a good student that it was easy for parents and teachers <br/>\nalike to ignore my passions and talents in favor of my academic <br/>\nskills. Sometimes I feel like I learned all the wrong things! But <br/>\nfrom an academic standpoint, they were all the &quot;right&quot; things for &quot;a <br/>\nsuccessful future&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until I was in my twenties that I learned the things I <br/>\n*really* needed all along - what and how I learn best, and how to <br/>\ncommunicate effectively. My kids aren&#39;t having to wait that long. By <br/>\npersuing their passions, they are learning what and how they learn <br/>\nbest Right Now. By living in the real world every day they are <br/>\nlearning important communication skills. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4. Can the state penilize you for unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling is a kind of homeschooling and therefore legal. Some <br/>\nstates require more documentation than others to show kids <br/>\nare &quot;learning&quot; in ways that the state understands, but its still <br/>\npossible to unschool and find ways to appease the state - because <br/>\nlearning is going on all the time. Check for local unschooling groups <br/>\nonline - other unschoolers in your state will be the best source of <br/>\nspecific advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Help!

Once you kick the books you will have all that time you use to<br/>\ndevote to book study to follow your family&#39;s bliss. I am sure that you will<br/>\neventually work it out. It might be hard at first, you may feel pressed to<br/>\n*DO* a lot. Take it easy, relax, allow yourself and your kids to de-school a<br/>\nbit. You will find your groove. I am a list maker so I have lists, lol. I<br/>\nhave my daily chore list (for me not my kids) of the household stuff I would<br/>\nlike to tackle to maintain the house adequately. My standards may not be<br/>\nyour standards. My standards aren&#39;t much as I would rather play with the<br/>\nkids or go somewhere than scrub a bunch so I really just maintain and then<br/>\nevery once in a while do a good clean. I blogged about how I clean online<br/>\n(see bottom of email for link). Having a monthly calendar helps us too. We<br/>\nfill out our calendar so we don&#39;t over book. We have a few things we<br/>\n&quot;always&quot; do and then work around them to fill in the rest. We sometimes<br/>\nschedule in time to relax. We also have a date night for individuals (ie<br/>\nMama and dd12 or papa and ds6, etc) that happen weekly for some on on one<br/>\ntime. It isn&#39;t a lot but it works for us.<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n2. We have no extra money to buy resources for them to persue their<br/>\npassions. There are many things they would like to do (places to go) or<br/>\nbuy and we just don&#39;t have the finances to do this for them. I just feel<br/>\nlike if we can&#39;t provide these things for them they will not be able to<br/>\nlearn the things they could if we were able to provide more for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Well is that absolutely true? You have no money at all for passions? If<br/>\nit is than maybe it won&#39;t work right now. But I think you might be surprised<br/>\nif you dig a little deeper. First off learning is free. It doesn&#39;y have to<br/>\ncost a lot. You likely already buy your kids toys/games/books. You bought<br/>\nyour ciruicullum books. You maybe be able to wrangle your finances a liitle<br/>\nmore.<br/>\nWe cut things that are less important abd put money  towards things that we<br/>\nfind important. Like we don&#39;t buy clothes, except socks and skivvies. I get<br/>\nthem free from a clothing free store or craigslist or freecycle.<br/>\nOccaisionally we will buy clothes at a yardsale but only if it is special<br/>\nlike a pokemon shirt or happy bunny shirts. Specific or nice clothes isn&#39;y<br/>\nimportant. However, going to unschooling gatherings are major priority. We<br/>\njust spent about 500 bucks on a week at the water park. It was worth every<br/>\npenny and we surely woulkd have been happier with nicer clothes.<br/>\nWe also don&#39;t spend a lot on books. We use to not spend any but now my dd12<br/>\nneeds certain books when they first come out :-) It feeds her passion.Other<br/>\nboos we get off craigslist, freecycle, the free book thing (in Baltimore<br/>\nMD), paperbackswap.com, ebay, half.com or the library.<br/>\nToys are free or cheap too. Added to the other places we score at thrift<br/>\nstores or yard sales as well. My kids ask for something I try to find it,<br/>\nfree or cheap. If I can&#39;t it goes on our vision board and we get it when we<br/>\ncan afford it. Feed the passions.<br/>\nMy kids aren&#39;t doing any formal classes right now. We have and they can be<br/>\nthe right fit for a passion but not the only way to feed their souls. There<br/>\nare a few animal care classes my dd could take but she volunteers at a cat<br/>\nrescue and gets double the benefits for free. My kids do youth combat<br/>\nthrough SCA and that is free and their favorite activity! We get out a lot<br/>\nto parks (free) and take use of free museum days or we buy passes and see a<br/>\nmuseum a lot for a while and move on. Since we travel our museum passes<br/>\nreally are worth it. We have a science center pass that allows us to enter<br/>\nfor one year 5 museums within a 1.5 hour drive plus countless others around<br/>\nthe country. For less than 100 bucks a year!<br/>\nWe do a working share with CSA and get food (veggies) in exchange for our<br/>\nservice. It is fun and good exercise (no gym needed). We also get loads of<br/>\nnutrious food. There are also discount food shopping places. I shop around<br/>\nto food shopping. I make sure I am getting the best prices on what we eat. I<br/>\nspend about 150 on a family of 5 (3 adults sized eaters and 2 kids) per<br/>\nweek. I am looking to go lower when we start the CSA for the summer. I<br/>\nnoticed a huge savings when we stopped eating as entertainment. we still<br/>\nentertain ourselves with special meals but we spend more energy making them<br/>\nfrom scratch and really enjoying them. We rarely do prepackaged anymore. we<br/>\nalso don&#39;t eat out. We realized that with a toddler and a high sensative<br/>\nchild it just wasn&#39;t fun. Perhaps in a few years :-) My oldest loves to<br/>\nexperienment with different cultural foods so we make sure she hows an<br/>\noutlet (my mother and her go out once a month or so).<br/>\nToday my kids are biking (it is sooooo warm) and down at our local<br/>\nplayground. I am not there because the baby is asleep in my arms. But those<br/>\nthings are free. We have a bunch of cool stuff at our house as well, a<br/>\ntrampoline, a wii, a club house, a play room, an art/projects room. There is<br/>\na lot of to do just hanging around our house. We have a buhnch of cool books<br/>\nwith ideas in them to browse in case they run out...I don&#39;t think they have<br/>\ncracked them much as they have thier own ideas. Much of what we have at our<br/>\nhouse was free or hella cheap. I get all of ourstuff (furniture, clothes,<br/>\netc) from freecycle, friends, craigslist, &quot;sidewalk&quot; scores, etc. I have a<br/>\nmental list and a physical list (personal vision boards) of all the stuff my<br/>\npeople like.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n3. What if they don&#39;t learn...there is no turning back...I can&#39;t get<br/>\nthose years back for them...what if they are disadvantaged for life. I<br/>\nbelieve if they had the resources (see #2) they could learn but without<br/>\nthem I am not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Exactly, each second is precious. Don&#39;t waste it doing things that don&#39;t<br/>\nfeed you soul, your passions, create joy not resentment. if it doens&#39;t work<br/>\nout (I can&#39;t even imagine how/why) Catching up with school aged peers is<br/>\nreally easy. Kids learn what they need to know. It is not what you know but<br/>\nthat you have the desire to learn that is really important.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you are imagining that they will unschool themselves and still keep<br/>\nthe world divided into school subjects. They won&#39;t and that ok, no it is<br/>\nbeet than ok it is good. The world outside of school isn&#39;t broken into<br/>\nsubjects. We don&#39;t all know the same things abotu the same things. That is<br/>\ngood. There is no reason for your child/ren to know what other kids her/his<br/>\nage know.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n4. Can the state penilize you for unschooling. We live in Connecticut<br/>\nfor now...(thinking about relocating to Florida)...CT is very easy on<br/>\nhomeschooling but I still worry if it gets out that we unschool that we<br/>\ncould get in trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I don&#39;t know that CT laws are but unschooling is the same legally as any<br/>\nother kind of &quot;homeschooling&quot;. You don&#39;t have to specify that you are<br/>\nunschooling as opposed to schooling at home. You just have to figure out how<br/>\nto comply withthe laws. It is typically quite easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Unschooling makes sense to me, it feels right...I just<br/>\nhave to get past these fears and have some peace and then I think we<br/>\nwould be okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Let go off you fears. The future will happen whether we worry about it or<br/>\nnot.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231930081,"authorName":"DJ250","from":"&quot;DJ250&quot; &lt;dj250@...&gt;","profile":"wibberbie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Help!

I want to unschool but I am afraid...<br/>\n <br/>\nHi, Lori,<br/>\n Well, I&#39;ll reply to #3:  That&#39;s exactly the point, there is no second<br/>\nchance at childhood!!  The idea is that children will learn what they<br/>\nneed to learn WHEN they need to learn it and THEY know what they need.<br/>\nIt makes absolutely no sense to them (or to me!!) when they are<br/>\npresented with arbitrary school work and subjects that have little to<br/>\nnothing to do with daily life for them.  Children (humans) are natural<br/>\nexplorers and want to fit in with the world around them.  So, every<br/>\nexploration should be valued!  Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s just &quot;fluff&quot; on TV<br/>\nor looking through a microscope!  THEY are getting something out of what<br/>\nthey are doing.   How would you feel if your husband said to you &quot;You<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be wasting your time reading that book!  You should be<br/>\nlearning calculus instead.  I want you to learn calculus and do these<br/>\nproblems by the end of the week.&quot;  If you decide to pursue a degree in<br/>\nengineering, calculus will certainly be valuable and you&#39;ll want to<br/>\nlearn it.  If not, it&#39;s a chore and doesn&#39;t fit into your life!<br/>\n I think where you&#39;re driving yourself nuts is that you expect their<br/>\nexplorations to look like school work. ( I&#39;ve been there!)  Some days it<br/>\nmay resemble that, some days not, esp. the younger they are.  Children<br/>\nplay and that is what childhood should be about.  Feel free to strew the<br/>\nhouse with new things-a colorful rock on the kitchen table in the<br/>\nmorning, books from the library brought in the car for a trip to the<br/>\nstore, go on Netflix and pick out DVDs and pop them in and watch them,<br/>\netc.  Pursue your own interests, as well!  Show them that adults don&#39;t<br/>\njust do work around the house (though I do enjoy a bit of housework :-))<br/>\nbut like to paint, read, take hikes, whatever. And join in on their fun,<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\nI guarantee that anything they are doing is not a waste of their time or<br/>\nyours!  As they grow older, you&#39;ll find some of their interests may<br/>\nbecome more academically-oriented, as they grow out of playing with<br/>\nLegos, dressing up, etc. and look to maybe going to college.   Hey, my<br/>\n41 y.o. friend still likes to hula hoop!!   For now, let childhood be<br/>\nhappy and enjoyable, not a time for acculumating info from school<br/>\nsubjects. :-)<br/>\nMy .02, <br/>\n~Melissa :-)<br/>\n <br/>\n              <br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Lori and I am a homeschooling Mom of two years to Christopher<br/>\n10, Lily 8, Emma 5, and Matthew 2. I live in Connecticut and my husband<br/>\nand I work opposite each other so we can be home with our children. I<br/>\nwork two 10 hour shifts each week and he is self employed and works on<br/>\nthe days I am off. When he does not have work I will pick up extra at<br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe currently do an eclectic type of cirruculum with the kids. Math from<br/>\nhere, language from there..etc. I think they are learning from some of<br/>\nwhat they are doing but not from everything they are doing. I guess I<br/>\nfeel some of what they are doing is a waste of time for them because<br/>\nthey are not learning from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my core I believe unschooling is the best way to learn. I am just<br/>\nafraid of the following and hoped some of the seasoned unschoolers out<br/>\nthere could give me some advice that would maybe ease my mind so we<br/>\ncould try unschooling. Ok here is my not all inclusive list of fears...<br/>\n<br/>\n1. With four kids and working opposite each other, and money issues my<br/>\nhusband and I are a bit stressed to say the least. I am worried that<br/>\neither of us will not have the time to foster what each of their<br/>\ninterests are as there are four of them and only one of us at a time and<br/>\nwe have no family support. When we are home there is so much to be done<br/>\nthat I feel to unschool effectively you need to have alot of extra time<br/>\nto devote to your kids passions. Please don&#39;t get me wrong it is not<br/>\nthat we don&#39;t want to have the extra time the reality is that very often<br/>\nthere is just many other things to do ie, cooking, cleaning, laundry,<br/>\nshopping, paying bills, bookwork for the business etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. We have no extra money to buy resources for them to persue their<br/>\npassions. There are many things they would like to do (places to go) or<br/>\nbuy and we just don&#39;t have the finances to do this for them. I just feel<br/>\nlike if we can&#39;t provide these things for them they will not be able to<br/>\nlearn the things they could if we were able to provide more for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. What if they don&#39;t learn...there is no turning back...I can&#39;t get<br/>\nthose years back for them...what if they are disadvantaged for life. I<br/>\nbelieve if they had the resources (see #2) they could learn but without<br/>\nthem I am not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Can the state penilize you for unschooling. We live in Connecticut<br/>\nfor now...(thinking about relocating to Florida)...CT is very easy on<br/>\nhomeschooling but I still worry if it gets out that we unschool that we<br/>\ncould get in trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that is bascially it...time, money, big brother and once commited not<br/>\ngetting the years back if it doesn&#39;t work...those are my main<br/>\nfears...Side note...I have anxiety issues so if these seem unrealistic<br/>\nthey may be..I tend to worry about EVERYTHING!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would love any personal stories, words of encouragement, helpful<br/>\nhints or anything that may help me so I could do what I really want to<br/>\ndo in my heart. Unschooling makes sense to me, it feels right...I just<br/>\nhave to get past these fears and have some peace and then I think we<br/>\nwould be okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to babble...
