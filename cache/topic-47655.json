Sometimes you can find instructions for making them, too, out of a tin can.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also a good time to buy cheap candles in general, and have fun with different kinds. Triple wick candles are kind of cool as are the different sorts of floating candles - the kind that float in water and the kind with a resevoir of oil which floats in water. And you can find all sorts of fun candle holders, and instructions for making pierced metal or paper candle holders. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile you&#39;re at it, burn some magazine pages and see if the flames turn colors, or look up what sorts of minerals make which colors and see if you can make colored flames. I know copper will turn a flame green. And I think its epsom salts in alcohol which make a blue flame? It&#39;s been awhile ;) A nice, sturdy ceramic dish is handy for burning things in like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nIncense sticks are a great, simple way to play with fire and smoke. They aren&#39;t as heavily regulated as something like sparklers, but they can be just as much fun to wave around with the end still lit, or once the flame has gone turn the lights out and &quot;write&quot; with the glowing tip in the air. And then you can also write in the air with the smoke, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":124256069,"authorName":"Bun","from":"&quot;Bun&quot; &lt;alohabun@...&gt;","profile":"alohabun","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Playing with fire","postDate":"1321290306","msgId":47673,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo5cmhvMitlaGwyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGo5cDVvaitrZjAxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47672,"nextInTopic":47676,"prevInTime":47672,"nextInTime":47674,"topicId":47655,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son has a piece of flint that he loves.

Light it and let it go for a minute. Then put the lid on and watch it die out. You might see a little wisp of smoke start. Remove the lid right then and poof! Like magic, the flame comes back to life. Lid again, dies out; remove, poof!<br/>\n<br/>\nSame candle, light it. Peel an orange (or lemon or lime but oranges are bigger!) Squeeze the orange peel, outside of the skin toward the candle and watch the minute spray of orange oil droplets make sparkly little bursts (not enough to ignite anything but really pretty like indoor fairy fireflies)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo do outdoors: the old &quot;light a fire with a magnifying glass&quot; can be fun. Look for cheap &quot;seconds&quot; on what are called &quot;Fresnel Lenses&quot; - big focusing lenses (hubby has a couple, 11&quot;x11&quot; - they can start a campfire or charcoal grill in a minute or two depending on the kindling and such - leaves and newspaper in seconds).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong with playing with this, we also included information about how fire &quot;works&quot; - it needs fuel (wood/paper/candle wick), oxygen, and an ignition source/spark/heat. Remove any one thing and no fire. We also included fire safety (stop, drop, roll; where the home smoke detectors are and what they sound like; we discussed an escape plan from the house and where to meet outside; how to put out different types of fires, etc). Of course, this wasn&#39;t all one big &quot;lesson&quot; but rather little conversational bits over several YEARS of time, like when we&#39;re starting a campfire in the back yard (DH and DS would check the DEP website to check the fire safety status - if it was a &quot;burn ban&quot; day, due to lack of rain or high winds, DS would inform me &quot;no campfire today - too dangerous&quot;) or when we&#39;re starting a fire in the fireplace or sautéing on the stovetop or popping popcorn.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, that pops up another thought - if you don&#39;t have a fireplace or space for a campfire, then see if you can find someone who does and arrange to go visit (maybe offer to bring cookies and cocoa or marshmallows to roast). It&#39;s really interesting to see DS&#39; relationship with &quot;dangerous&quot; things like fire and sharp knives (he&#39;s 13 now) - instead of &quot;banning&quot; those things, we helped him explore to his comfort level at whatever age he was, as his partners. I remember my brother trying to hide a small burn in his shirt (and on his abdomen) when he and a couple friends were secretly playing with matches (because that was forbidden). I didn&#39;t ever want DS to have to hide for fear of punishment, ESPECIALLY when it was something as potentially dangerous as fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Rossing<br/>\nQuality Control<br/>\nCNC Software, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
