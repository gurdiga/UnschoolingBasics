I was just thinking the other day (and not for the first time) that one of my reasons for unschooling is that I don&#39;t want my children to be so dependent on other people to tell them whether they&#39;re right or wrong.  As a formerly schooled child myself, I definitely still struggle with withdrawal from that.  It was so gratifying to write a paper or answer a teacher&#39;s question and be told I was right.  Unfortunately, life isn&#39;t like that usually.  Certainly not parenting nor any other people-related profession.  You have to figure it out for yourself, and know that there probably is not a perfect answer most of the time.

Most parents were schooled kids at one time.  We all jumped <br/>\nthrough hoops to get rewards for our own behavior -- getting good <br/>\ngrades, praise, avoiding punishment, etc.  And now, especially if <br/>\nthey were a good students in school, many parents are still jumping <br/>\nthrough hoops to get praise and compliments.  Alfie Kohn calls it <br/>\ncontingent self-esteem in &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; -- basically, <br/>\nyour self-esteem goes way up or way down depending on how someone <br/>\ntreats you.  If someone is angry or disapproving, you can feel <br/>\nreally low.  On the other hand, if you are praised, your feelings of <br/>\nself worth going soaring. (We could do a whole other topic about how <br/>\na mother&#39;s self esteem can be contingent on how happy or sad her <br/>\nchild is)  So, they get compliments, &quot;good parenting!&quot; from family, <br/>\nstrangers or anyone for how their children look and behave.  Well, <br/>\napparently most people want children to act like little adults.  <br/>\nWhat are the characteristics that are most often praised about <br/>\nchildren?  I would say, having good manners, being neat and tidy, <br/>\nlooking good, doing something with a visible result or a goal in <br/>\nmind.  <br/>\n<br/>\nParents are like little school children desperately trying to get an <br/>\nA in childrearing.  You get a bright red X if your child cries in <br/>\nthe store for more than 30 seconds!  You get extra credit if you <br/>\nremind your child to say please or thankyou.

And if your child yells at you in <br/>\npublic, well (depending on how you react to it) you just might get <br/>\nan F.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has helped me is just being aware of how I feel about my <br/>\nchildren when other people are around.  Then really questioning <br/>\nwhere those thoughts are coming from.  Someone had mentioned certain <br/>\nof their children have helped them become better people through <br/>\nhardship.  I think the same can be said of where you live.  We live <br/>\nin a very conservative southern state.  That has forced me to stop <br/>\nrelying on other people&#39;s opinions of my children.

So yeah, it&#39;s a concern there.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, what we have now is usually washing in a hurry to get out of the home, <br/>\nignoring the dirt until it&#39;s time to leave. what we usually do specifically is to have a warm <br/>\nwet washcloth, present it while gently talking about dirt, and ask if she wants to blow or <br/>\nspit while we&#39;re washing. That&#39;s the most effective quick wash. About 50% of the time <br/>\nshe&#39;ll spit while we quickly and gently wipe. The rest of the time she turns her face away, <br/>\nand &quot;ehhhh, ehhh!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if we have plenty of time, she will wash her own hands, but the process is long. She <br/>\nmust drag the stool to the sink herself (she&#39;s sixteen months old and even the little tykes <br/>\nstool is heavy and onerous) Then the water has to run for ten to fifteen minutes while she <br/>\nwatches it. Then she&#39;ll introduce one finger at a time into the stream, then splash all over <br/>\ncreation. Eventually, after an additional five minutes or so, she&#39;ll be clean enough that I&#39;m <br/>\nokay with it. However, at no point does face washing even approach the joy with which she <br/>\nwashes her hands (or wipes her bottom, but that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother post lol!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think we&#39;ll just focus on clean hands and stomach, and leave the face for <br/>\nbathtime. She&#39;s usually okay sitting in the bath, we still can&#39;t wash her face, but when we <br/>\npull her out of the tub she&#39;ll wipe her face with the towel. I&#39;m not sure why, it&#39;s never wet, <br/>\nbut there it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all, some of her sensory issues already are very intense, she can&#39;t handle uneven <br/>\nsocks, or if her elastic bottom pants are uneven.

Every time I go to wash her face, I show her the cloth first, and<br/>\nask her &quot;May I please wash your face?&quot;  Then gently reach out. If she<br/>\ndeflects me or says no, I wait a moment, then ask again. Sometimes she&#39;ll<br/>\ncontinue to refuse and I&#39;ll try again ten minutes later. Sometimes she&#39;ll<br/>\ntake the cloth and want to do it<br/>\nherself, and letting her do this a lot was important as we developed<br/>\nthis interaction.<br/>\nA lot of the time she happily presents her face and hands to be wiped when<br/>\nasked.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I forget, get impatient, or there&#39;s danger to her that I have to<br/>\navert by cleaning her off immediately (rare),<br/>\nshe will automatically resist.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo let us know, how are you approaching the washing-off?<br/>\nI realize you may already be trying such approaches and she just plain<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want it under any circumstances,<br/>\nof course, but it would help to know exactly how you go about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Tom C.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 3/1/07, Melissa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:autismhelp@...\">autismhelp@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; and quite quick since the girls are needing me soon.<br/>\n&gt; Just a &#39;how would you handle this&#39; question.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Avari is 16 months old, and has the greatest attraction to dirt I&#39;ve ever<br/>\n&gt; seen in a child.
