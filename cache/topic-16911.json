I&#39;m not sure if it was here or on AU, but the basic <br/>\nconsensus was that with AP parents as the child gets older they <br/>\nusually choose one of two paths either they stick with the trust <br/>\nportion of AP which leads to more mindful parenting, or they seem to <br/>\nchoose the path of trying to provide what&#39;s best for their child <br/>\nwhich may lead them to positive parenting, but not necessarily <br/>\nmindful or respectful parenting.  I used to attend our local chapter <br/>\nof API and as dd hit the toddler years I started trying to figure <br/>\nout where AP fit in that&#39;s when I found unschooling.  However the <br/>\nlocal leader for the API group is very anti unschooling, and very <br/>\ncontroling by nature.  I remember reading a book called &quot;Don&#39;t shoot <br/>\nthe dog&quot; that she lent me when I was starting to hit some of the <br/>\nearly toddler issues.  Basically this book is a behaviour control <br/>\nbook.  So if you&#39;re out there looking for <br/>\nmindful/respectful/peaceful parenting groups make sure you&#39;ve found <br/>\nwhat you&#39;re looking for.  Don&#39;t assume that just b/c it&#39;s AP or <br/>\npositive parenting that it&#39;s the same thing, it isn&#39;t always.<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty<br/>\nmom to Rachel 2.9</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16878,"nextTopicId":16802}}
