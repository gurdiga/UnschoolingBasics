Is there a  <br/>\nuniversity or college library anywhere near that might lend some  <br/>\nmaterials. How old is your son?  Canadian author Kenneth Oppel has a  <br/>\ngreat fiction series for kids, have a look at www.silverwing.ca. Where  <br/>\ndo you live?  If you&#39;re anywhere near Austin Texas, I&#39;ve read that the  <br/>\nbats coming out from under the Congress Avenue Bridge on summer nights  <br/>\nis quite spectacular. According to the website, Bat Conservation  <br/>\nInternational, wwwbatcon.org, these bats form the &quot;world&#39;s largest  <br/>\nurban bat colony&quot;. This organization has a newsletter and their  <br/>\nwebsite has lots of data and pics. Also, your son could join BCI and  <br/>\nlearn more that way as well as helping the bats! Maybe he&#39;ll become a  <br/>\nbat biologist, I see from the BCI site they&#39;re looking for one in  <br/>\nTexas. Here is a quote from their website:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You can help save bats, too! Become a member of BCI to help support  <br/>\nour worldwide effort to protect bats and bat habitat. You�ll receive a  <br/>\nfree gift for joining and a subscription to BATS magazine. Or, simply  <br/>\nmake a general donation � your generous gift goes a long way towards  <br/>\nreversing the plight of these remarkable and vulnerable animals&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck<br/>\n<br/>\nKimberlee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 22-Jul-08, at 10:00 PM, Shannon wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I am so glad the duck/chick idea is going to work out for you.

Well, a few weeks back we brought some night <br/>\ncrawlers home (fishing bait) to see if the lizard would eat them (nope!) <br/>\nand she adopted them as her pets. I&#39;ve kept them in a large planter and <br/>\nam feeding them kitchen scraps. Soooo. We have baby bird food (in her <br/>\nmind).

It&#39;s illegal with few exceptions and it&#39;s *awful.*  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t mean do whatever a child wants at the expense of others.    Tell her why it would be wrong to take the bird from its natural home and its mother.    How old is she? <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could go see the bird family every couple days to watch their progress from a distance.  Get a good scope or field glasses.   You could look on the internet for baby bird pictures.  You might find books with pictures of baby birds or maybe you could print some baby bird pictures from the web.  Go for walks with her and see how many birds you spot.  Watch movies with or about birds.  See if you can locate a pigeon club near you and arrange to visit one or some of the members.  If she&#39;s little, pretend she&#39;s your baby bird and feed her pretend bugs and worms.  Get cd&#39;s of bird songs and let her listen to those - either the kind where birdsong is incorporated into some soothing music or the kind for bird identification.  Depending where you live your game board might have a program for folks to hatch and release wild game birds.   You might have some moral objection to those kinds of programs, I&#39;m just offering ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\n***Any suggestions for how I can say &quot;yes&quot; without violating a deep conviction?***<br/>\n<br/>\nFind out what&#39;s fascinating about baby birds and give her lots of bird experience that doesn&#39;t involve violating the law or causing harm to others.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb suggested a video camera and that might fall under disturbing an active nest according to the IMBTA.  Even if it&#39;s not illegal, a mother bird who&#39;s nest is too frequently interfered with might abandon her nest and nestlings and start over in a safer place.  I don&#39;t know how long it would take to set up a camera, how close it would have to be, how much maintenance the camera would need, how frequently the lens would have to be cleaned, etc and that might be more interference, stress and nest disruption than a bird could take.   Birds don&#39;t know our intent.  Their experience is that an animal frequently visiting the area close to their nest is a threat.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":348924346,"authorName":"Robin","from":"Robin &lt;GaiaAlive@...&gt;","profile":"robinnidana","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Help!

She found a nest <br/>\ntoday with baby birds in it and wants me to take it down so she can hold <br/>\na baby bird.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told her that this will probably kill the baby bird and that they are <br/>\nvery difficult to keep alive. She asked what they eat and I said &quot;worms&quot; <br/>\n(we live in the desert--they actually eat all kinds of desert insects <br/>\nand larva, I&#39;d guess). Well, a few weeks back we brought some night <br/>\ncrawlers home (fishing bait) to see if the lizard would eat them (nope!) <br/>\nand she adopted them as her pets. I&#39;ve kept them in a large planter and <br/>\nam feeding them kitchen scraps. Soooo. We have baby bird food (in her <br/>\nmind). She doesn&#39;t even mind feeding one &quot;pet&quot; to another.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to say &quot;no.&quot; She really wants this. But I also don&#39;t think <br/>\nI will be able to keep the baby bird alive. And just disturbing the nest <br/>\nwill probably mean the parent birds will abandon it (that&#39;s what I&#39;ve <br/>\nalways been told anyway). I might be willing to let her experience the <br/>\nslow death of a baby bird, but I just can&#39;t bring myself to participate <br/>\nin its cause. I feel a strong moral compulsion to not harm the birds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have offered to get her a bird from the pet store or to get her baby <br/>\nanimals from the pet store, but she is fixated on having a baby bird. <br/>\nShe has held baby chicks from a friend&#39;s flock.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions for how I can say &quot;yes&quot; without violating a deep conviction?<br/>\n<br/>\nI told her that I would think about it for a day and we&#39;d talk again <br/>\ntomorrow morning if she still wanted the baby birds.
