I would have sent it to some<br/>\nindividual email addresses, but I didn&#39;t have them all.   I&#39;m emailing all<br/>\nof you in the hopes that you can give me some encouragement and support.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have gone back to work full time, which means the children (ages 8, 7, 4,<br/>\n2) will be going to school and daycare.  This is partly not my choice.  We<br/>\nhave been homeless this past year and were accepted into a transitional<br/>\nhousing program.  Part of the requirement is that both adults in the home<br/>\nhave to work.  So..here I am.  I thought about a night job, but they are<br/>\nscarce here in the DC area, and then there&#39;s the matter of staying up all<br/>\nday with energy for my children - HA!  This is the move we have to make<br/>\nright now.  Add to that my children were bored and frustrated because we<br/>\nweren&#39;t doing anything all day.  No trips (no funds), no classes (no funds),<br/>\netc, etc.  We spent our days in the house and I think we were all tired of<br/>\nlooking at our four walls.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t intend this move to be forever.  While I do love the job that I have<br/>\nnow, I love my children more.  Once we are out of this program we will look<br/>\nfor more creative ways to earn an income and create a more flexible<br/>\nschedule.  Until then..how can I help my children transition?  Safiya (who<br/>\nwill be 9 this month) will be going into the 3rd grade instead of the 4th,<br/>\nto ease some of the academic stress that she&#39;ll be facing.  This change is<br/>\nhardest on her.  She has no desire to go to school at all.  Dakari (who will<br/>\nbe 8 in October) will be going into the 2nd grade.  He has wanted to go to<br/>\nschool for some time now, so he&#39;s thrilled about going.  He requires a type<br/>\nor regimented structure that I&#39;m just not able to give him at home.  Khalid<br/>\n(4) and Khidar (2) will be going to daycare.  I&#39;m not sure how they&#39;ll take<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can email me offlist so we don&#39;t clog the lists with stuff that doesn&#39;t<br/>\npertain to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\n<br/>\nMaisha<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25834,"nextTopicId":25659}}
