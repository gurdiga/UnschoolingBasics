For those that\r<br/>\nhaven&#39;t heard, it was just diagnosed recently and she&#39;s already been\r<br/>\nstarted on Chemo.  Diana and family were at the Live and Learn\r<br/>\nconference last October and she&#39;s a regular at several unschooling lists.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnyway, Pam Sorooshian had a lovely idea...to have a bunch of us make\r<br/>\nquilt  squares and have a big quilt made for their family.  A\r<br/>\nvolunteer has been found\r<br/>\n(Jill Parmer) and the parameters have been set up. We need the squares\r<br/>\nvery soon, I&#39;ll get the address for mailing them to shortly.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe&#39;re doing this quietly offlist, in hopes of keeping it a surprise\r<br/>\nfor them. If you know anyone that would like to be involved, please\r<br/>\npass this on to whomever you choose. Jill says she can put it together\r<br/>\nno matter how many there are.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo here&#39;s the scoop:  The squares need to be pre-shrunk (so wash\r<br/>\nmaterial first) and cut to an 11x11 size.  Please keep your design\r<br/>\ninside of a 10x10 size\r<br/>\nthough, so she has room for seams. Sign the square (inside the 10x10\r<br/>\narea of course) with a fine tip permanent marker if you wish.\r<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to be a quilter to get involved!  There are fabric\r<br/>\npaints, photo transfers, fabric crayons, embroidery...a lot of ways to\r<br/>\ndecorate fabric without actually quilting.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere&#39;s some of their favorites, which Kelli T posted at the\r<br/>\nImagination Tribe\r<br/>\nlist:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n    ~Kyra says, Hannah&#39;s fav color is definitely blue, and she likes\r<br/>\nyellow too.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n    Some interests of Hannah,  her fav stuffed animal is a polar bear,\r<br/>\nshe plays\r<br/>\nbasketball and sings.  They play alot of bratz, don&#39;t know if that is\r<br/>\nhelpful or\r<br/>\nnot. &lt;g&gt;    She likes camouflage colors too.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n    Oh, Kyra says Hayden&#39;s favorite color is red, and I know Diana\r<br/>\nlikes the\r<br/>\ncolors in her poncho, the oranges, reds.~\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Imagination Tribe is handling the organization, so lotsa\r<br/>\nunschoolers there already know (Kathryn B, Kelli T,Danielle, Kelly\r<br/>\nLovejoy, Rue, Gail etc...)  I&#39;m passing this to the people I&#39;m sure\r<br/>\nwould want to know that aren&#39;t there. Please continue passing this,\r<br/>\njust tell everyone to try and keep it from Diana.
