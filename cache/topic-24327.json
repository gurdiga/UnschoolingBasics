That is what got my<br/>\nattention.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt probably should have gotten your attention *just* enough to ask what <br/>\nhe meant by that---or to look at it more closely yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think that every child who uses a pacifier requires oral <br/>\nsurgery? Does he?<br/>\n<br/>\nScare tactics.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nYou&#39;re right.  I try not to get sucked in with these.  But, that one got me.  My pediatrician has said things like, &quot;if the baby cries, just turn the monitor off&quot;, or &quot;if the toddler acts up, just put her in a play pen&quot;.  I overlook these comments, because I am really only there to let him check out their physical well-being.  I totally disagree with him on child rearing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI did learn something else I didn&#39;t know from the posts, that<br/>\naccording to Dr. Sears, the pacifier should not be used without the<br/>\nloving presence of the parent (much like the bottle for bottle fed<br/>\nbabies).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure I understand this. So, if the child is apart from the <br/>\nparent (at Grandma&#39;s for the afternoon, for instance), she shouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nallowed to have the comfort of her pacifier? That seems like the time <br/>\nshe would want it *more*.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I misunderstanding?<br/>\n  Sorry for the ambiguity on my part.  On the Dr. Sears web-site:<br/>\n  &quot;Pacifiers are meant to satisfy intense sucking needs, not to delay or replace nurturing. A person should always be at the other end of a comforting tool. The breast (or the finger) has the built-in advantage of making sure you don&#39;t fall into the habit of just plugging up the source of the cries as a mechanical gesture. When baby cries, if you find yourself, by reflex, reaching for the pacifier instead of reaching for your baby, pull the plug Â– and lose it. &quot;<br/>\n   <br/>\n  There were times that I found myself doing this.  Especially if  busy (ie. shopping or driving/riding in the car).  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am the first person to leave a shopping trip or stop the car if a baby needs soothing.  But, in retrospect I did not have a firm grip on this notion until now.  I just mean that in the future I will try harder to &quot;be sure&quot; there is not some other way to satisfy my child before I give up and stick the pacifier in (if I ever use it again).   I may just try a snuggly or something next time.  There are certain breastfeeding advocates who totally shun the pacifier.  I don&#39;t know exactly what to think.  <br/>\n  I totally agree about the soothing away from Mommy.   I stay at home and take them everywhere I go.  They have relationships with others (grandparents, cousins, friends) but, they have never been unwillingly left alone for even a minute.  Daddy and I only go where we are all able to go.  He came up with the motto:  &quot;if one goes, we all go&quot;.  We literally all go into Wal-Mart if that is what they choose to do (they have the option to stay in the vehicle with Daddy to watch movies or play in the back).  Most of the time they choose (cry) to go into the store.  They have stayed in the vehicle with Grandma and enjoyed it, and sometimes they don&#39;t want to, and that is fine too!  I have never left them at Grandma&#39;s house for obvious reasons (per my other post).  All of my family lives in another state (12 hours away).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my point with all of that is that I am very accommodating to my children&#39;s requests and I would never intentionally disallow them to self soothe.  I questioned whether or not I had failed in that respect (giving a pacifier to hush my child) and that is why I was glad to see that point brought to my attention.<br/>\n  I hope I explained this better:)<br/>\n  Thanks for listening.<br/>\n  Joy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.

It resonates with me, still.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.<br/>\n<br/>\n***************<br/>\n<br/>\nStop thinking about changing &quot;for good and not just for days or moments.&quot; That is just another thing to overwhelm you and you don&#39;t need that! <br/>\nJust change the next interaction you have with the kids. <br/>\nStop reading email right now and do something &quot;preventative&quot;ï¿½ something that helps build your relationship with them. Fix them a little tray of cheese and crackers and take it to them, wherever they are, unasked. Sit down on the floor and play with them. If nothing else, just go and give each of them a little hug and a kiss and say, &quot;I was just thinking about how much I love you.&quot; <br/>\nOkayï¿½so that is one good, positive interaction. <br/>\nAgainï¿½just change the next interaction you have with the kids. Focus on making the next interaction another one that builds up your relationship. If the next one is because the kids are fighting, STILL keep in mind that you want this interaction to do something positive for your relationship with the kids and stretch your thinking as to how you can make that happen. In other words, you kind of think from their point of view about yourself. Consider what thoughts you want going through their head. Do you want them thinking: &quot;She never takes time to even find out what the problem is?&quot; Or &quot;She always blames me?&quot; Or &quot;She&#39;s such a hypocrite, doesn&#39;t want to hear us yelling, but then she yells at us.&quot; &quot;She hates me.&quot; And so on. What do you want them to be thinkingï¿½what words (articulated or not) do want tumbling around inside their head? Maybe &quot;She understands how I feel.&quot; Or &quot;She really cares about helping us solve our problems.&quot; Or &quot;She is trying hard to be fair.&quot; Or &quot;She&#39;s calm even w<br/>\nhen I&#39;m not.&quot; Or &quot;Mom is the best listener in the world.&quot; &quot;Mom loves me even when I&#39;m causing problems.&quot; <br/>\nAnd, eventually, you want them to think like this:<br/>\n&quot;Mom will help us find a solution.&quot; <br/>\n&quot;I can stay calm like mommy does even when I&#39;m mad.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I can listen carefully like mommy does when there is a conflict.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I can recognize feelings, like mommy.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I can come up with new ideas, like mommy does when we have trouble.&quot; <br/>\nThere is no substitute for being authentically &quot;there&quot; for themï¿½for genuinely trying to help them resolve problems. For putting your relationship with them at the forefront of every interaction, whether it is playing together or working together. <br/>\nNone of us are perfect; we&#39;ll all have some regrets. But with my kids 19, 16, and 13, I can now say that I will never say anything like, &quot;I wish I&#39;d let them fight it out more,&quot; or &quot;I wish I&#39;d punished them more,&quot; or &quot;I wish I&#39;d yelled at them more.&quot; I will only ever say that I wish I&#39;d been more patient, more attentive, more calm and accepting of the normal stresses of having young children. <br/>\nOne interaction at a time. Just make the next interaction a relationship-building one. Don&#39;t worry about the one AFTER that, until IT becomes &quot;the next one.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: weaning off pacifier","postDate":"1181530481","msgId":24373,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOTc5RUFGRTQyODRERS00QUMtMTRGOEJAd2VibWFpbC1kZDExLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY0Z3NzMStuaHJzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGY0Z3NzMStuaHJzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24371,"nextInTopic":24374,"prevInTime":24372,"nextInTime":24374,"topicId":24327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Seriously, when something would come up, I would <br/>\nthink, what would my mom do? and do the opposite. Not very mindful of me, that came <br/>\nlater. It was a process. It makes me think of a recent blog article I read (Crystals Daikini <br/>\nCrossroads, which I love btw). She was writing about &#39;the process&#39; and had pictures of their <br/>\nhouse, how her daughter has Stuff. And it looks like a mess, but it comes together in the <br/>\nmost beautiful way, everything with a purpose, everything where it needs to be. And <br/>\ngrowing into an unschooling person looks messy, in our brains. We have to get all that <br/>\nstuff out, let it have it&#39;s purpose, and CREATE the life we choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think everyone struggles, but that is mostly that is self-perception. what helps me the <br/>\nmost is to have a friend of like mindness around, who can say, &quot;I really like how you <br/>\nhandled that!&quot;<br/>\nI do yell. Not at the kids, but when I&#39;m frustrated I can let out a holler. ARGH...this isn&#39;t <br/>\nworking how I planned! Then the kids come up and reassure me, point out suggestions, <br/>\nand I love it. I love how they are learning that even adults need help, that I&#39;m open to <br/>\nsuggestions, and modeling how to ask for help. It&#39;s better than yelling at the kids, and <br/>\nmaybe I&#39;ll move to a point where I am not yelling, but I doubt it. I&#39;m an emotional <br/>\nexpressive person, and my joy, sorrow, eagerness are all so intense!<br/>\n<br/>\nControl is overstated.

SO all week the house has been a wreck and it&#39;s okay. We expected that, dirty <br/>\ndishes in the sink, pizza boxes in the floor, toys and dirt and bugs and clothes <br/>\neverywhere. For everything there is a season (hum with me! I honestly didn&#39;t mean that to <br/>\nhappen but now it&#39;s stuck in my head) There are days the kids really want the house clean, <br/>\nand there are days when it&#39;s not even part of our thought process.

The nurses at the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1251159373\">Thank you everyone for the responses.  Please note, she was my first <br/>\nchild and I am definitely more informed the second time around.  The <br/>\nnurses at the hospital actually gave her the paci to begin with.  I <br/>\ntold the nurses &quot;no&quot; paci when my son was born and gave it to him <br/>\nwhen he was a few weeks old (because at the time I heard of the SIDS <br/>\nrisk being lessened).  It causes my dd great distress to think of <br/>\ngiving her beloved paci up and that is why I asked everyone here for <br/>\nadvice.  In my heart it did not feel right to pressure her.  Her <br/>\nteeth, both top and bottom, do stick out somewhat in the perfect <br/>\nshape of the pacifier.  The dentist said that when the palate <br/>\nhardens (around this time) that the palate would be permanently <br/>\ndamaged and she would require oral surgery.  That is what got my <br/>\nattention.  Definitely not misinformed people who have been so rude <br/>\nto take the pacifier out of my daughters&#39; mouth (yes, this has <br/>\nhappened).  I always tell them to leave her alone and mind there own <br/>\nbusiness (yes, I would like to sock &#39;em, but I can&#39;t do that).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd LOVES ballet.  She dresses in her tutu and slippers every day <br/>\nand dances in front of her instructional video.  We are going to let <br/>\nher take lessons.  I have informed her that she would have to put <br/>\nthe paci away for this and she would have to go poohpooh on the <br/>\npotty (a teacher requirement).  She has been wearing panties since <br/>\nlast October.  When she feels the urge to do #2, she will run and <br/>\nput a pull-up on herself, and then ask to be changed.  She has not <br/>\nshown an interest in doing the latter at this time, but she will <br/>\nhand me her paci and smile when she begins to play dance.  I <br/>\nencourage her &quot;big girl&quot; attitude.  I sometimes tell her that I <br/>\ncan&#39;t understand what she is saying because of the pacifier, and she <br/>\nwill remove it long enough to get her point across.  I tell her I <br/>\nwould like to see her pretty smile or teeth and she will show them <br/>\nto me.  Then she pops the pacifier back in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to stop bugging her about it.  She is smart enough to <br/>\nknow that she will have to give it up when she is ready (ballet <br/>\nlessons).  I don&#39;t think she is ready yet.

She LOVED IT!!    We were  concerned about her teeth and<br/>\nasked our dentist if it would cause problems with her teeth.   He said<br/>\nthat kids who have orthodontic problems typically have them because of<br/>\ncrowded teeth (which isn&#39;t caused by a paci)  or from tongue thrust<br/>\n(not caused by a paci and actually the paci forces the tongue into a<br/>\nhealthier position ..probably why it helps with SIDS)  and from the<br/>\npressure that some kids put on their front teeth when they suck<br/>\nfingers... some finger suckers do not exert pressure and some do.  <br/>\nHis opinion was basically that kids who end up with braces will end up<br/>\nwith braces whether they suck a paci, their fingers or nothing<br/>\nadditionally (aside from nursing from breast or bottle).  His opinion<br/>\nwas give her the damn paci if I am wrong we can fix her teeth but we<br/>\ncan&#39;t fix her psyche if we forbid her natural need to suck!!    For<br/>\nthe record she did give up her pacifier at around 4 1/2 yrs old on her<br/>\nown.... she also had braces because her mouth was small and her teeth<br/>\nwere crowded.... her projected 24 month treatment plan took only 14<br/>\nmonths and she has beautiful teeth!   <br/>\nI have a friend who refused to let her child have a paci because she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to ruin her teeth or have to fight to take it away at a<br/>\ncertain time.... this child became a committed finger sucker, chewed<br/>\non everything, mouthed everything and so forth.   Every time this<br/>\nchild found a way to soothe herself her mother took it away.   This<br/>\nsame child is now 14 yrs old and doesn&#39;t trust her mother to meet her<br/>\nemotional needs and never has.

Joanna Briggs. Nursing Standard 20.38 (May 31,  <br/>\n2006): p52(4). A survey of existing research on the subject:<br/>\nPacifier use and dental malocclusion<br/>\n<br/>\nThe relationship of pacifier use and dental malocclusion has been a  <br/>\nsubject of great interest to dentists and child health professionals  <br/>\nfor many years. Forty-seven articles were identified that purported  <br/>\nto investigate this relationship. Six studies met the inclusion  <br/>\ncriteria, of which five were cohort studies (Bowden 1966, Larsson  <br/>\n1986, Bishara et al 1987, Paunio et al 1993, Warren and Bishara 2002)  <br/>\nand one was a case-control study (Meyers and Hertzberg 1988). There  <br/>\nwere no RCTs and the excluded articles were mostly case-series and  <br/>\ncross-sectional designs. Not one of the cohort or case-control  <br/>\nstudies reported a measure of association, such as an estimate of  <br/>\nrelative risk. It was therefore not possible to include these studies  <br/>\nin the final review.<br/>\n<br/>\nSummary of findings: Because of the absence of adequate studies, no  <br/>\nconclusions could be made.<br/>\n<br/>\nImplications for practice: Dental malocclusion: it was found that  <br/>\nbecause of the paucity of adequate epidemiological studies, no  <br/>\nconclusions could be made.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, Effects of nonnutritive sucking habits on occlusal  <br/>\ncharacteristics in the mixed dentition in Pediatric dentistry  <br/>\n(Pediatr Dent) 2005 Nov-Dec; 27(6): 445-50, says that &quot;Sustained  <br/>\npacifier habits, including those of 24 to 47 months, were associated  <br/>\nwith anterior open bite and Class II molar relationships, while digit  <br/>\nhabits were associated with anterior open bite when sustained for 60  <br/>\nmonths or longer. CONCLUSIONS: Malocclusions are quite prevalent in  <br/>\nthe mixed dentition, and anterior open bite and posterior crossbite  <br/>\nmay be preventable by modifying nonnutritive sucking behaviors.,&quot;  <br/>\nwhich seems to mean that yes, bite problems are more common in kids  <br/>\nwho use pacifiers long-term.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I can&#39;t seem to find anything that lays out what  <br/>\nsorts of dire things happen to people with bite problems. Just how  <br/>\nbig a problem is it? I&#39;m not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo pacifiers reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome? A meta- <br/>\nanalysis.<br/>\nSource:<br/>\nPediatrics (Pediatrics) 2005 Nov; 116(5): e716-23<br/>\nSays: &quot;Published case-control studies demonstrate a significant  <br/>\nreduced risk of SIDS with pacifier use, particularly when placed for  <br/>\nsleep....  Therefore, we recommend that pacifiers be offered to  <br/>\ninfants as a potential method to reduce the risk of SIDS. The  <br/>\npacifier should be offered to the infant when being placed for all  <br/>\nsleep episodes, including daytime naps and nighttime sleeps. This is  <br/>\na US Preventive Services Task Force level B strength of  <br/>\nrecommendation based on the consistency of findings and the  <br/>\nlikelihood that the beneficial effects will outweigh any potential  <br/>\nnegative effects.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n4.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found estimates ranging from 30% to 75% of how many children  <br/>\neventually get braces. It varies by economic class and other factors.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a son who still sucks his thumb at age 6. He does it much less  <br/>\nthan he did when he was younger; he used to suck all night, and now  <br/>\nonly sucks to fall asleep, and rarely during the day. He has created  <br/>\na big gap between two teeth in front by thumb-sucking--a perfect  <br/>\nthumb-sized opening. After some initial panic when he was 3 or so, I  <br/>\nhave gotten really comfortable with it. I think that when his adult  <br/>\nteeth start to come in, if he is still thumb-sucking, I&#39;ll talk to  <br/>\nhim about the possible effects. I remember reading in my earlier  <br/>\nresearch that most bite problems caused by thumb-sucking self-correct  <br/>\nby age 10 if the child stops sucking, and the remainder were  <br/>\ncorrected during orthodontia the child probably would have needed  <br/>\nanyway. Our dentist commented at Eric&#39;s last checkup that his front  <br/>\nteeth have moved back from the pressure of his lip since he has cut  <br/>\nback on thumbsucking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Eric was a toddler, the dentist and especially the hygenist were  <br/>\nalmost rabid about the horrors of thumbsucking. But at Eric&#39;s last  <br/>\ncheckup, the dentist told me that Eric&#39;s teeth had moved since he had  <br/>\n&quot;quit thumbsucking.&quot; I said, &quot;Actually, he is still thumbsucking,  <br/>\njust much less often and for much less time.&quot; And the dentist said  <br/>\nsomething mellow like, &quot;Oh, well, most kids quit on their own by the  <br/>\ntime they could do any real damage.&quot; Not what he said three years  <br/>\nago! Did we get him on a bad day back then? Did he want to scare me  <br/>\ninto making thumbsucking a big issue? Is he mellower because Eric&#39;s  <br/>\nbite isn&#39;t as bad as he expected? Who can say.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always thought that the stress we&#39;d all suffer if we tried to make  <br/>\nEric stop sucking his thumb--and the inevitable failure of such  <br/>\nefforts, and him feeling shamed, and driving the behavior  <br/>\nunderground--were not worth any possible benefit to his teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always try to remember with doctors and dentists that they&#39;re  <br/>\nusually giving advice based on one aspect of the whole person. Their  <br/>\nconcern is, rightly, with the teeth--but they&#39;re not always putting  <br/>\ntheir recommendation re: teeth in a context of a person&#39;s overall  <br/>\nwell-being. There may very well be other factors that outweigh their  <br/>\nspecific advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Eric,and with my son Carl, who is still nursing at 3, I have  <br/>\nvery mellowly commented on occasion, &quot;Someday you won&#39;t suck your  <br/>\nthumb anymore.&quot; or &quot;Someday you&#39;ll be all done nursing!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 9, 2007, at 11:33 AM, trewhittjoy wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The dentist said that her palate<br/>\n&gt; will begin to harden soon and we will have major problems later if<br/>\n&gt; she doesn&#39;t get rid of it before then.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk your dentist to quantify the &quot;major problems&quot; and provide  <br/>\ncitations.
