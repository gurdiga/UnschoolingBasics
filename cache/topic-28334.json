Or Dh? What if I got up tomorrow and decided to<br/>\ndo just what  I wanted? No breakfast today kids,no clean clothes<br/>\neither. I&#39;m going to  enjoy myself,not do anything useful<br/>\nwhatsoever.Everbody fend for yourself  now.BTW, Dh lost his job<br/>\nbecause he&#39;s just doing what is fun now, and we no  longer have a<br/>\nhouse or car,or  electricity&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThis may have already been said, if so just delete.  I am in the  middle of <br/>\nreading responses.  But there is a middle ground.  I know  several moms who do <br/>\nnot enjoy cooking big meals.  But still love their  children and their <br/>\nchildren are fed, not starving.  Since one  mom&#39;s son was little he has been cooking <br/>\nhis own eggs, and enjoys it.   I make a double batch of bagels every week and <br/>\nstick them in the fridge so that  in the mornings there is something already <br/>\ndone, either they or I can pop them  in the toaster.  I do not like cooking <br/>\nfirst thing in the morning.  We  have cereal around that they like so they can <br/>\nget it for themselves.  To  tell you the truth really we graze, eat small stuff <br/>\nall day.  We never eat  together as in a &quot;meal&quot; because we are never hungry <br/>\ntogether.  So we have  lots of snack type foods in the fridge where the boys can <br/>\nget at them.   They know how to prepare their favorites like mac and cheese, <br/>\nor make a  sandwich.  etc.  So just because you do not get up and cook <br/>\nbreakfast  does not mean that the kids will not have breakfast.  And if you do not  <br/>\nenjoy cooking breakfast I would encourage you to all brainstorm and figure out <br/>\na  way to make it work.  It can be done.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI enjoy myself every day, and I think that is plenty useful.  But if  there <br/>\nare things you are doing that you do not enjoy I personally would not be  doing <br/>\nthem.  I would brain storm to see that things happen though.   Like laundry, <br/>\nyou can do a chore exchange with a friend.  She brings her  kids over and she <br/>\ndoes your laundry and you make a supper type meal for her to  take home and <br/>\npop in the oven at her house.  Etc.  Have to think  outside the box.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIf Jackson, he&#39;s my dh, did not enjoy his job we would brainstorm about  that <br/>\ntoo.  I know people who have made that change in life as well.  I  know one <br/>\ndad who did not want to work, he wanted them to all be together as a  family <br/>\nall the time.  He didn&#39;t want to miss out on the unschooling, the  house, the <br/>\nfamily at all.  So they saved up money for a year, sold  everything they had, <br/>\nbought a piece of land in BC, Canada, and are homesteading  right now.  They are <br/>\nbuilding their own house, well right now they are on  hold for the winter, <br/>\njust keeping warm.  But they are doing it, they made  the leap.  They still have <br/>\na car, no electricity except a small generator  they use when they want to <br/>\nmake a phone call (longer story...LOL).   Eventually they will have a wind <br/>\ngenerator and electricity.   They are  loving it.  And no one is working outside <br/>\nthe home for money.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am not saying that you have to do that.  LOL.  I am just saying  to <br/>\nconsider everyone&#39;s wants and needs, your&#39;s as well, and brainstorm about  these <br/>\nthings.  Don&#39;t just assume that it can&#39;t be done.  Don&#39;t assume  that if you <br/>\ndidn&#39;t cook breakfast the kids would go hungry.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOK I am rambling now, but anyway, it can work.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nPam  G<br/>\n<br/>\nOur Blogs:<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/_\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/)\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/_\">http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/)\">http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************Check out AOL&#39;s list of 2007&#39;s hottest <br/>\nproducts.<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)\">http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28330,"nextTopicId":28351}}
