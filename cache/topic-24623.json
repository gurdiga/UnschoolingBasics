When I got home I<br/>\ntold my granddaughter about my dilemma and that we could mix our own strawberry<br/>\nmilk but that I couldn�t promise it would taste right.

Had the drink been a disaster and we threw it out, she at least would have known I respected her request as best I could at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is important for her to know me, who I am, and that, among other things, I live by certain values and convictions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother of my standards is to respect other people&#39;s autonomy so I don&#39;t tell others what they can and can&#39;t buy.

Obviously it&#39;s not enough for her to listen to YOUR <br/>\ndecision, and obviously, she needs that experience, and it might take years until she sees <br/>\nthe &quot;evil&quot; behind McDonald&#39;s  or maybe she just decides, she likes it more than she find&#39;s <br/>\nit evil. Maybe, she likes it, but doesn&#39;t like the evil part and decides to do whatever it takes <br/>\nto work there and take control of things, and *change* the things she doesn&#39;t like about it. <br/>\nOr to sell OK-Burgers in her own store. The thing is, you don&#39;t have control over the <br/>\noutcome anyway, but you are not helping her making that decision on her own, although <br/>\nit&#39;s part of her human rights to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, I don&#39;t agree that you should do whatever it takes to force yourself going there, if you <br/>\njust &quot;can&#39;t&quot;.

But there are some other solutions <br/>\nto that!<br/>\n<br/>\nCan an uncle take her? Can you invite friends of her over and let her have small party there <br/>\nwith two or three friends and wait outside in the car?

My best friend and sometimes- <br/>\nlover used to joke that she was going to get &quot;Dyke&quot; tattoo&#39;d on her  <br/>\narm, and if she ever decided she wasn&#39;t a lesbian anymore, she&#39;d just  <br/>\ncut her arm off.

When the kids want  <br/>\nsomething, I do think about it in the context of the family budget,  <br/>\nand I share that information with them.

I also don&#39;t want to spend my money<br/>\nthere - it feels completely wrong to me.  I have as strong a reaction<br/>\nto McD&#39;s as I do to certain political figures/issues (not to name<br/>\nnames, but just to give you an idea of how visceral it is for me).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I balked at going to Cracker Barrel because they, at the time, <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t hire gays, my friend (who was offering to take me there after <br/>\na long dog show day) told me, &quot;Kelly, you can&#39;t EAT politics.&quot; &lt;g&gt; At <br/>\nthe time, the comraderie and his humor broke my will. But his comment <br/>\nleft an impression.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;ve acknowledged to her that I know that she is really curious<br/>\nabout McDonald&#39;s, that she feels like everyone has been there but<br/>\nher.  I&#39;ve talked to her about the nutritional aspect of the food and<br/>\nlikened it to something like hot dogs - something that&#39;s not good for<br/>\nyou to eat all the time, but fine to have once in a while, which is<br/>\nthe kind of statement that is consistent with our family<br/>\nnutritionally-based conversations that we have had in the past.  (I<br/>\nknow that this is a point that we could also go around and around on<br/>\nin this group, but I&#39;d like to keep on the question I&#39;m posting here<br/>\n(for now - I&#39;d probably like to talk more about this in the future),<br/>\nif possible).  I&#39;ve acknowledged that the food does taste good, and<br/>\nthat she will get there at some point, but that but Mommy and Daddy<br/>\njust don&#39;t want to go there because we don&#39;t like the company (which<br/>\nis something she has heard us say about other companies that we don&#39;t<br/>\nsupport).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou seem to be open-mided enough to talk about in depth with her, but <br/>\nnot *quite* ready to take the leap and do what she wants. You may be <br/>\ntalking it to death!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I say this, and then there&#39;s this niggling feeling inside of me<br/>\nwhich says &quot;well, what exactly do I want to happen here?&quot;.  Do I want<br/>\nfor this to build it up inside of her, and then have someone else<br/>\ntake her, and totally remove myself from her experience of it, and<br/>\nremove myself from a possible growth experience for both of us??<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t feel right either.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it makes it all the more attractive---is that what you want? I <br/>\nmean---it must be *REALLY* good if you&#39;re keeping her away from it. It <br/>\nmust seem to her that you think she can&#39;t handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, what I wonder is what do you do when your political,<br/>\nmoral, etc views totally clash with what your child wants, and you<br/>\nfeel so strongly about this that you do not want to put even one<br/>\npenny of your money into the coffers of that world.  You can put any<br/>\nexample here (McD&#39;s, WalMart, going to school, giving to certain<br/>\ncharities, supporting political candidates, etc, etc).  Pick your<br/>\nmost detested issue and insert it into the situation (if you need to<br/>\nseparate it a bit from the exact issue of McD&#39;s, which can be a hot<br/>\nbutton).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that my child&#39;s (or my friend&#39;s) happiness is more important <br/>\nthan my politics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *still* VERY unwillingly give money to the schools AND to politicians <br/>\n(right out of my taxes) AND to charities I don&#39;t believe in (check out <br/>\nyour local electric & gas company&#39;s chosen charities!!!). I can&#39;t stop <br/>\nwhere they decide to put *my* money. I *can* choose how much pleasure <br/>\nI&#39;ll give my children. They grow up. They&#39;ll eventually learn more and <br/>\nmore about certain complanies and make their own, wise choices.

By scary","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1980687727\">Here&#39;s a bit of a different scenario and how I&#39;ve dealt with it. I detest<br/>\nscary movies, I&#39;ve never liked them, even as a teen and have never seen one.<br/>\nBy scary I mean what is probably termed a horror movie. I can handle a good<br/>\naction movie and some violence, but I just can&#39;t do the horror genre.  When<br/>\nmy kids started getting older and wanting to watch them I just cringed<br/>\ninside. I was sure they would be exposed to horrible things and lose their<br/>\nsensitivity and gentleness.  The oldest hit this age (early teens) shortly<br/>\nafter we embraced unschooling. It took me  a while to really get to the<br/>\npoint of keeping my opinions to myself about horror movies. I, quite<br/>\nhonestly, was pretty judgemental of anyone wanting to watch horror<br/>\nmovies. As it turns out, all of my kids enjoy a good horror movie. Even my<br/>\n11 year old has seen a couple that the older kids deemed ok for him.  What I<br/>\nhave done is learned to appreciate what they enjoy about the movies. I no<br/>\nlonger am judgemental about the movies and I go out of my way to create a<br/>\nfun environment when they want to watch one. I still can&#39;t bring myself to<br/>\nwatch them. I don&#39;t think I need put myself in the position of nightmares<br/>\nand being uncomfortable. But I can still appreciate their joy and facilitate<br/>\na fun time. I provide snacks, extra pillows and blankets for those that need<br/>\nto hide behind them during tense scenes. I keep myself available in case it<br/>\ngets too intense for someone and they want to be safe with me (not that<br/>\nthat&#39;s ever happened....but just in case)  If a movie makes it hard to sleep<br/>\nor someone has a nightmare, I&#39;m available without an &#39;I told you so&#39;<br/>\nattitude.   I can support their desire to watch these movies and even be<br/>\npart of it by providing snacks and a place to watch without actually<br/>\nparticipating in watching the movies. In return, my kids respect my feelings<br/>\nabout the horror movies and don&#39;t try to get me to watch and when they talk<br/>\nabout the movie with me, they are careful not to be too graphic. And of<br/>\ncourse, they are still sensitive and gentle....watching the movies has not<br/>\nchanged who they are.  This is something that seems perfectly obvious to me<br/>\nnow, but I really had to make a paradigm shift to get to that point.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-20 (out on her own now!), Lisa-18, Karl-16, & Ben-11.<br/>\nTwo boys that live with us and call me mom: Mike-18 & Willis-17<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reachhomeschool.com\">http://www.reachhomeschool.com</a><br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art www.artkunst23.com<br/>\n&quot;All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.&quot;<br/>\n  Gandalf the Grey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 6/22/07, Leslie Kowalski &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lrkowalski@...\">lrkowalski@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   From Kelly:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One of the things we would do IS model.

I know that this is my issue, and I don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; put it all over my daughter. I also don&#39;t want to spend my money<br/>\n&gt; there - it feels completely wrong to me. I have as strong a reaction<br/>\n&gt; to McD&#39;s as I do to certain political figures/issues (not to name<br/>\n&gt; names, but just to give you an idea of how visceral it is for me).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, I&#39;ve acknowledged to her that I know that she is really curious<br/>\n&gt; about McDonald&#39;s, that she feels like everyone has been there but<br/>\n&gt; her. I&#39;ve talked to her about the nutritional aspect of the food and<br/>\n&gt; likened it to something like hot dogs - something that&#39;s not good for<br/>\n&gt; you to eat all the time, but fine to have once in a while, which is<br/>\n&gt; the kind of statement that is consistent with our family<br/>\n&gt; nutritionally-based conversations that we have had in the past. (I<br/>\n&gt; know that this is a point that we could also go around and around on<br/>\n&gt; in this group, but I&#39;d like to keep on the question I&#39;m posting here<br/>\n&gt; (for now - I&#39;d probably like to talk more about this in the future),<br/>\n&gt; if possible).
