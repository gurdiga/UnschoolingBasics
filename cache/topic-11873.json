I was a little tough on my dh only because,<br/>\nwithout meaning too, he&#39;s sort of scared Zak off of from telling him<br/>\nanything.  For instance; two weeks ago Zak had learned on his own<br/>\nvolition about how to find the radius of a circle.  He was all excited<br/>\nand couldn&#39;t wait to tell Donnie all about it...Well, long story<br/>\nshort, Zak told him and Donnie was like, &quot;Oh, ah-huh, good job Zak.&quot; <br/>\nHE then proceeds to give Zak lessons on finding the area of a<br/>\nrectangle and how to figure out how much a cylinder can hold.  Poor<br/>\nZak just followed him around the house looking all pathetic, while he<br/>\nwas taken to websites for formulas and everything.  :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking, he ONLY wanted to show you one thing.  Well, it was just<br/>\nyesterday when Zak picked up the book again because he was worried dad<br/>\nwould make him do all this other stuff.  LOL  He&#39;s now hesitant to<br/>\nshare his passions with Donnie.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ren Allen&quot;<br/>\n&lt;starsuncloud@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot; &quot;Quit asking what Zak is learning and just trust that he is<br/>\n&gt; getting what he needs for the day?
