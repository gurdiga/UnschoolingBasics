It&#39;s just odd enough, because usually<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m hesitant to get them swimming so late, cranky neighbors, hard to<br/>\n&gt; see, I&#39;m exhausted....So while they jumped in, I ran inside, got my<br/>\n&gt; swimsuit and opened up all those glow sticks. In the pool, I cracked<br/>\n&gt; them all open and started quietly distributing them around the pool.<br/>\n&gt; THe girls were THRILLED. We had so much fun swimming around diving<br/>\n&gt; for sticks.

We floated in the noodle chairs and watched<br/>\n&gt; lightening bugs. We counted stars and adopted some as our own. We all<br/>\n&gt; gathered around Avari in her baby floatie and laughed as she splashed<br/>\n&gt; her way around to try and get the floating glow sticks.
