How can you be something going on","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-600600945\">What does that mean? I read the first comment and I got befuddled. What does it mean to be 9 going on 18 years or months? How can you be something going on another thing? It seems so anticipatory and not very much about enjoying now with your child.  I know people whose 18 year olds are amazing to be around and 18 months was fantastic, all about exploring and coming back and those first really solid forays into independent moments. It was cuddling and nursing and falling to sleep together and spreading out an old sheet on the floor and getting out glue and glitter and paints and making the most amazing art/mess. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems a very derogatory sort of throw off comment. Y&#39;know one of those things that you say because it will illicit a laugh from other people but you don&#39;t really think about how it may bias you against your own child. A young child acting like a teenager or a toddler, not behaving appropriately for their age. But they are appropriate for their age and environment. They just are. I think I may be so far removed from this kind of view that I totally don&#39;t know what would make me think those kinds of things. 18 is the age of majority in the U.S., are they voting? or driving? or what? Is it about saying mean things or dressing too adult? And being a toddler, is that about being emotional about something, needing something, whining about something? I do that at 40 sometimes, and I&#39;m not a toddler. Sometimes I&#39;m just hungry or frustrated or needy. <br/>\n<br/>\nLanguage makes a difference. What you say impacts on what you do or think or feel.
