We are homeschooling our 4yr old and <br/>\n3month old. This is an appeal for any homeschoolers out there who want a sea change...<br/>\n<br/>\nwe have recently moved from Melbourne to buy/ build in a new ecovillage in Currumbin <br/>\nValley Queensland. The web site is:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theecovillage.com.au\">http://www.theecovillage.com.au</a><br/>\n<br/>\nwe have already met one lovely couple with an 18 month old who are buying in and share <br/>\nour approach to natural learning etc.. so we thought that we would shamelessly put this <br/>\nout into the world so we can connect with other like minds. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have considered a sea change why not also check out this ecovillage. We would love <br/>\nmore homeschoolers here! Contact the ecovillage via their web site above for more info... <br/>\nor contact us if you like. Before you ask NO we dont get commissions - we are just really <br/>\nkeen to have a vibrant homeschooling community here :)<br/>\n<br/>\nplease feel free to pass this onto anyone you know who might be interested. Even if you <br/>\nare a homeschooler around currumbin/ gold coast please do drop us a line.<br/>\n<br/>\nall the best,<br/>\nanne & arun</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14922,"nextTopicId":14902}}
