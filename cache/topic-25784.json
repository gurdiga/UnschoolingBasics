I NEED her to meet some <br/>\nunschooled kids ;) (Yes, *I* need it, she is not too sure of this whole thing, but <br/>\nI&#39;m steady! lol!)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe sounds like a great person. An interesting young woman that I wish I <br/>\n*could* meet in person. She inspired me, well your writing of her, to just <br/>\ncontinue the process, watch it unfold and see what I can do to gently direct along <br/>\nthe way. I&#39;m struggling with Grace being a schooled child while I attempt an <br/>\nunschooled lifestyle - anyway, lol, I&#39;m so happy to read about her <br/>\ndevelopment and your development.
