She tried to tell people that they have to or can&#39;t<br/>\ndo things, especially her older sister.  I would like to think that we let<br/>\nher have enough control over her choices that she doesn&#39;t need to be<br/>\ncontroling.  Is it her age?  Is it that we should be giving her less choices<br/>\n(sometimes I think things are easier for her if she DOESN&#39;T have to make the<br/>\nchoices)?  I should also mention that I believe she borders along the lines<br/>\nof having Sensory Integration Dysfunction, but have not had her tested or<br/>\nanything.  It mostly affects her hearing.  She can&#39;t handle loud noises.<br/>\nShe also has what appear to be &quot;anger issues&quot;.  When things don&#39;t go her way<br/>\nshe gets really hot tempered and used to hit, bite and pinch others, but has<br/>\nnow directed it to blankets, pillows, etc.  After taking her off Red dye the<br/>\n&quot;anger issues&quot; got better but the SID stuff got worse.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nRoger, Amanda, Marti and Lilly<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I have never let my schooling interfere with my education&quot; -Mark Twain<br/>\n<br/>\n1/2 Price Slide shows make GREAT Christmas Presents!<br/>\nExample Slide shows at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://server3.inalbum.com/ia30/show/choose2bgr8/\">http://server3.inalbum.com/ia30/show/choose2bgr8/</a><br/>\nSee my pictures at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.HopesCreations.com\">http://www.HopesCreations.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://choose2bgr8.deviantart.com/gallery/\">http://choose2bgr8.deviantart.com/gallery/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27140,"nextTopicId":27247}}
