I think you&#39;re right in not wanting<br/>\nto spill the whole beans in one go re - all the areas you could point out,<br/>\nbut if you could explain briefly to her that your daughter was upset by feeling<br/>\nso challenged in public and that you feel a nine year old needs a little<br/>\nmore understanding and that you really respect your sister wanting to make<br/>\namends, etc. it may be the first step in the process of a more authentic<br/>\nrelationship with your sister and maybe she could eventually be a safer aunty.<br/>\nI really empathise with you, my kids have two aunties - one is safe, one<br/>\nis very unpredictable due to her own chaotic sort of life and it can be confusing<br/>\nand distressing for the kids to relate to her.

I was so excited to meet them. They are fabulous. <br/>\nMy DH loved them too. But...<br/>\nI am not used to having any unschooled kids over and I confess I hold other kids to the same &quot;parenting style&quot; they are used at home.<br/>\nOk I do better than the parents   but still relate to my kids one way and to others another way most of the time. I say &quot;no nephew you cannot hit my cat&quot; because I have tried and unschooling approach and for the most part they just will keep doing until their mom scream and threatens to leave or else.  I do say it in a nicer way than mom but.....<br/>\nSo this unschooled awesome kid  stayed over and one of the nights he slept in my ds&#39;s room ( ds still sleeps with us).<br/>\nThe room has a TV with Satellite and DVR. Behind the wall where the TV is my room and there` is only a sheetrock  piece on an old window ( my room is a more recent addition to an old farm house).<br/>\nSo his mom said &quot; You can watch your TV show up there&quot; and I blurted out. &quot;Oh No It will wake up the baby in my room because you can hear everything thru that piece of sheetrock&quot;<br/>\nI said no and did not even think anything of it. <br/>\nA week or so later I was playing in the room with my ds while the baby slept in the other room. I asked him to be quiet and not make noise ( And that is hard for a 5 year old I know).<br/>\nHe was awesome and tried to be very quiet. Usually we play downstairs if dd is sleeping but ds wanted to play upstairs in his room. Than it hit me!!! I am sure the other unschooled kid that was here would have done the same and would have kept the TV low and would have been no problem. Or we could have moved the TV closer to the bed  and farther from the wall or... see it did not need to be a NO.<br/>\nWhat a &quot;ding bag&quot; I am. This kid was extremely polite and considerate and a really pretty amazing 11 y o boy.<br/>\nI am just so not used to it. I called his mom that moment and apologized to her and him.  Hey guys again I am sorry I say it again. I could have worked out a way to have the TV on. It was just one of those &quot;automatics-less-than-mindful-NO&quot;.<br/>\nThe worse is that it took me more than a week to even realize  that I had said no as a knee jerk reaction.<br/>\nLooking back I am sure I just did not want to have to go in and nurse the baby and settle her back to sleep because &quot;I&quot; wanted to chat with the guests.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much I still have to work on. I get everything in theory but I still fail in practice many many times and at least a few times a day on bad days. <br/>\nAlex<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7644358,"authorName":"Kidgie@aol.com","from":"Kidgie@...","profile":"mama_de_julian_y_julia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Do as I say....","postDate":"1186432857","msgId":25546,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQwNS4xNTVmYTcxOC4zM2U4ZTE1OUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25541,"nextInTopic":25548,"prevInTime":25545,"nextInTime":25547,"topicId":25524,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/5/2007 4:29:35 P.M.

I often<br/>\nfall into feeling like when people here say that they are &#39; truly<br/>\nliving RU &#39; that these kinds of struggles are no longer part of their<br/>\nday to day reality.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI always hesitate to bring the screw-ups here. I realize that my life <br/>\ncan seem sooo perfect when I write. But I&#39;m usually not writing about <br/>\nwhat&#39;s happening with me *now* because I&#39;m answering questions about <br/>\nothers&#39; situations and giving my advice based on something has has <br/>\nworked for me in a similar situation in the past. Meaning: I WAS ONCE <br/>\nTHERE TOO.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not all rosy and cheerful here 100% of the time. But it IS almost! <br/>\nMaybe 95%? But it&#39;s taken years and years of doing it and fixing it for <br/>\nit to get like this. Yes, due to hunger and lack of sleep and illness <br/>\nand really odd situations, things can revert back to pre-unschooling <br/>\ndays---but really only momentarily. But due to the large amount of work <br/>\nthat Ben and I have put into our parenting, *most* things can be <br/>\nremedied with a deep breath and a little hard thinking (as opposed to <br/>\nlashing out and using the very few tools we inherited from our parents, <br/>\nlike spanking and shaming). The times it happens now are few and far <br/>\nbetween.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, my children are 19 and 11---that makes a HUGE difference! The <br/>\nlarge age gap and their advanced ages make many of the issues here <br/>\nirrelevant in my life (no wee ones, none close in age). And mine are <br/>\npretty damned self-reliant! I mean---11 and 19? Other than driving <br/>\nDuncan around, they are capable of getting and doing whatever they <br/>\nneed! There&#39;s no sibling rivalry here. No one&#39;s spilling something he <br/>\ncan&#39;t mop up. There&#39;s no more writing on walls (other than in our music <br/>\nroom over the garage, where we ASK that folks write on the walls! &lt;G&gt;) <br/>\nor potty training or torturing of kittens  or running outside naked or <br/>\nnot cleaning up the craft area---these things just don&#39;t exist in our <br/>\nlives any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a few years (if you stop having babies! &lt;g&gt;), your lives will seem <br/>\nmore like mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was once where you are are now! I had a child in school through <br/>\nsixth grade, was room-mom, and was on the Parents&#39; Board. I parented a <br/>\nlot like my mother (not *as* bad, but still!).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome families here started out as gentle parents. Some got the message <br/>\nbefore their kids were born that there was a better way. And many of <br/>\nyou are starting EARLY compared to me (when Cam was already 13)! *Your* <br/>\nkids are sooo lucky!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I KNOW that our lives seem peachy-keen. ANd truly they ARE! I know <br/>\nmany of the regular posters here in real life. I&#39;ve been to their <br/>\nhomes. I know how they are with their kids.  ANd I know that they are <br/>\nREAL and that, even though it&#39;s NOT always easy, they work *very* hard <br/>\nto make their lives pleasant and peaceful and joyful. And I know how <br/>\neasy it is to be with them BECAUSE of how they are with their kids! <br/>\nI&#39;ve spent time with Ren and Deb and Rue and their kids. I was just up <br/>\nin Minnesota with Alex and Kelli and Karen---and in Florida with Gail <br/>\nthis last month. I got to visit Zenmomma&#39;s home in Oregon and spent <br/>\nLOTS of time with Mercedes and Sharon there. We had a blast in Hershey <br/>\nPark with the Traaseths and Kreams and Heyman-Gauchmans. We stopped by <br/>\nDanielle&#39;s house for lunch and to play with chickens. I&#39;ve dropped in <br/>\nom Mindy twice---just barely announced. I threw a large house concert <br/>\nfor Amy Steinberg at my home in March---65 unschoolers showed up for <br/>\n2-3 days (and not ONCE was the TV turned on)! &lt;BWG&gt; Aside form many of <br/>\nthe names already mentioned, Kathryn and Anne and several unschoolers <br/>\nI&#39;d never yet met were there. I MAKE time for/with these people because <br/>\nof how fabulous their lives are! It&#39;s easy to share a life like that! <br/>\nANd it&#39;s sooo easy to be a part of such a life!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that it&#39;s easy to DO. It&#39;s just that it BECOMES easier the <br/>\nmore you DO it. It takes WORK to be this easy! &lt;bwg&gt; Does that make <br/>\nsense?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I believed in &quot;blessings,&quot; I would say that our lives are blessed. <br/>\nBut it&#39;s really that we have CHOSEN to change the way we parent and <br/>\nview our children&#39;s lives. We SEE them as whole and perfect, and we <br/>\nknow that they are wanting to be the BEST Cameron and Duncan they can <br/>\nbe *at all times*. If they aren&#39;t, it&#39;s not for lack of trying: it&#39;s <br/>\njust that they don&#39;t have the tools *at that moment* to deal with that <br/>\nparticular situation. It&#39;s my job to help them acquire those tools. (As <br/>\nI search for a few of my own---as seen in the previous post that <br/>\nprompted this one! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, although it seems that there are never problems at my house, it&#39;s <br/>\njust that we have a REALLY big, full toolbox here, and it&#39;s getting <br/>\nbigger and bigger every day. It was not always that way---but it IS <br/>\npossible! &lt;G&gt; Our crappy moments are just fewer and further between. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt; When they do happen, they are smaller and more quickly and easily <br/>\nfixable than in the past---many barely worthy of mention---that&#39;s WHY <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t much mentioned!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, after seven years, you are still struggling, call me! &lt;G&gt; But I bet <br/>\nyou&#39;ll all be just fine. It just doesn&#39;t happen overnight. It&#39;s a <br/>\nprocess.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.

And what mistakes they have recently made<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny you should ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nI struggle with feeling like enough.  My 9yo dd is full of energy and a<br/>\nmillion ideas.  I can not (or we cannot) do everything she wants to do.  I<br/>\ntry to focus on the idea that everything can happen just not all at the same<br/>\ntime.but so many more ideas get dropped than followed through.  I focus on<br/>\nthe glory of her imagination and her intentions (most ideas are creative<br/>\narts or humanitarian endeavors.)  But I do struggle with feeling like I am<br/>\nenough.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy recent mistake.  Last week my sister was visiting.  We were at lunch in<br/>\ncity with grandmother and sister and kids.  My 9yo dd is a self proclaimed<br/>\nvegan and my sister insisted she is not a vegan because she still eats ice<br/>\ncream  (the last hold out of dairy).  My dd argued with aunt that she is a<br/>\nvegan while aunt continued to insist she was not.  My 9yo got quite.   While<br/>\nI calmly defended her right to call herself a vegan to my sister I hadn&#39;t<br/>\nrealized the affect this had on 9yo until 14yo dd nudged me under table and<br/>\nnodded toward 9yo who was sitting to my right in tears - very angry, very<br/>\nhurt.  I comforted her - but that certainly wasn&#39;t enough.  WE&#39;ve been<br/>\ntalking about this all week as 9yo dd now has experience of her aunt as<br/>\nbeing unsafe - translate - disrespectful.  DD asked me to talk to my sister<br/>\nwhen we saw her next.  I said to dd that i would but I wasn&#39;t sure that aunt<br/>\nwould understand enough to make an adjustment that would help to heal their<br/>\ndamaged relationship.  I was right.  When I saw my sis at end of week she<br/>\nacknowledged that she realized dd was still upset with her and when she<br/>\nasked me what she could do about it.I hesitated.  I didn&#39;t say to her -you<br/>\ncould apologize for not respecting her.I didn&#39;t say - gee, you are not<br/>\nreally an actor because you spend more time working at Starbucks and<br/>\nteaching.I didn&#39;t say she needs you to acknowledge who she is and not<br/>\ndevalue her opinion of herself.  I didn&#39;t get angry at my sister for hurting<br/>\nmy dd.  I hesitated because knowing my sister and how she is with her step<br/>\nson I didn&#39;t think my suggestion of making an apology would be meaningful to<br/>\nher - wouldn&#39;t be understood.  I value my relationship with my sister and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to offend her at the expense of not well defending my dd.  And<br/>\nbefore I could come up with a response that I hoped could be heard she<br/>\nshrugged me off and said, never mind, it would work out.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy family of origin doesn&#39;t work things out.  My current family stays in the<br/>\nmoment and works things out.  When I am with my family of origin I am not<br/>\nthe person I would like to be.  It is stressful and yet I don&#39;t want to<br/>\navoid them totally (just sometimes &lt;g&gt;).  One thing I struggle with is being<br/>\n&#39;too&#39; nice and not fully expressing my anger directly at the source.  In<br/>\nwriting this I think perhaps i can write a letter to my sister and explain<br/>\nmore fully the possibilities of mending with dd.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI just read this to dd and she wants me to clarify that she hasn&#39;t had ice<br/>\ncream in a while.  I also asked her if she wants me to write letter to<br/>\nsister and she responded by saying, &quot;you can if you want to..&quot;  but not<br/>\nnow.she wants me to do something with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":58132404,"authorName":"MarSi77@aol.com","from":"MarSi77@...","profile":"m6hschch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:Do as I say....","postDate":"1186399808","msgId":25530,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNhNy4xNWQ4ZDlhOC4zM2U4NjA0MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25527,"nextInTopic":25535,"prevInTime":25529,"nextInTime":25531,"topicId":25524,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kelly that was such a good post and one I can identify with also.

He&#39;s <br/>\ngenerally not mean---he just steers clear and avoids them when <br/>\npossible. I understand: when I was his age, I really didn&#39;t care for <br/>\nsmall ones either. Cameron (19), on the other hand, has always loved <br/>\nbabies and young children---even when he was a baby, he loved babies! <br/>\nNot Duncan. So when we visit folks with small kids, on the way, we talk <br/>\na LOT about interacting with them and how to respond and that he should <br/>\ncome ot me when one of the littler children starts to bug him. It&#39;s <br/>\nsomething we *plan* for.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...last month, we were visiting friends a long, long way away. Lots <br/>\nof driving (25 hours!), different water, local food, strange beds. <br/>\nThat&#39;s the set-up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had already visited two nights with a family with two darling <br/>\nchildren, five and 18 mos or so. Duncan handled himself well---staying <br/>\nnear me or reading a book quietly or playing a video game. I think the <br/>\nfive year old expected Duncan to be more of a playmate---and that&#39;s not <br/>\nreally Dunc&#39;s style, so I think he was a little disappointed that <br/>\nDuncan wasn&#39;t willing to hang so much with him. But Duncan had fun on <br/>\nthe farm, and he read his first book there from cover-to-cover, so it <br/>\nwas a great experience!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we journey on to our next home-away-from-So we journey on to our ne<br/>\nthree children: 10, 12, and 14. Duncan knows them well, and gets along <br/>\nwith all of them. While we are there, we learn that another unschooling <br/>\nfamily we know will be able to stop by and hang out with us for a few <br/>\ndays! (YAY!) They have three precious boys---I think they are three, <br/>\nfive, and seven.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I had spent a while talking Duncan about the first visit, but I had <br/>\ncompletely forgotten to chat with him about this change in plans. I was <br/>\njust excited to be able to see and visit with the other family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know, I know---a lot of build up...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...I was in the kitchen, and Duncan was at the kitchen table. One of <br/>\nthe boys (I think it was the five year old) came up and was asking <br/>\nDuncan questions about what he was doing (I think it was WOW). Duncan <br/>\nsnarled something not-so-nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was not out of his mouth more than a split-second before I snapped <br/>\nback LOUDLY and CLEARLY, &quot;Duncan! He is *very* young, and he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nnecessarily understand..necessarilynecess<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone laughing out loud at the irony yet? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, Duncan was hurt and embarrassed (moms were nearby watching <br/>\nthe whole thing). And yet I went on and on about how he doesn&#39;t handle <br/>\nlittle kids well and how we&#39;d *just* talked about this very thing, <br/>\nand....<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I felt horrible. About a half-hour later, he called me into <br/>\nanother room to talk (*he* has to initiate this), and he told me how I <br/>\nhad done to him *exactly* what he had done to the other boy. He <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have been more right.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe chatted in bed that night about how we each could have handled it <br/>\nbetter. We thought of 3-4 ways he could have been nicer/better prepared <br/>\nand of about 20-30 ways *I* could have responded better. &lt;G&gt; He&#39;s so <br/>\nsmart! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really not that the list-owners have this all figured out. We <br/>\nstill struggle and screw up. One of our goals is to be better parents <br/>\neach and every day. That was NOT one of my better moments. I can blame <br/>\nbeing tired and hungry and out-of-sorts, but it&#39;s absolutely no <br/>\ndifferent than what my young child was going through.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe certainly deserves more empathy than I do---he has only eleven years <br/>\non this planet.

I often <br/>\nfall into feeling like when people here say that they are &#39; truly <br/>\nliving RU &#39; that these kinds of struggles are no longer part of their <br/>\nday to day reality. This makes it harder for me to relate as these <br/>\ntypes of mistakes *are* my day to day reality. I am not talking about <br/>\njustifying ruley or schooley behavior, just examples of how you may <br/>\nfall off the horse and get back on. I like hearing that your son <br/>\ncalled you on it.  If he hadn&#39;t i.e., he was much younger and not as <br/>\nable to articulate his experience as well, would you have clued in as <br/>\nfast?

Sometimes I feel like I am losing all credibility as a <br/>\nparent because I keep messing up like this. They are gracious and <br/>\nforgiving, but they pretty much have to be, as they are all very <br/>\nyoung and rely on me for everything. I spent most of my adult life <br/>\nunlearning the negative parenting I grew up with by studying <br/>\neducation and child development. I have spent most of my life as a <br/>\nparent unlearning the schooley aspects of my education and teaching <br/>\ncareer. Baby steps, I guess. My mother&#39;s voice is still in my head <br/>\nand pops out occasionally with sarcasm and desperation. My teacher&#39;s <br/>\nvoice is there too, sometimes cheerfully blurting out &quot;good job!&quot; <br/>\nafter my kids clean up or share or burp even!

About a half-hour later, he called me into <br/>\nanother room to talk (*he* has to initiate this), and he told me how I <br/>\nhad done to him *exactly* what he had done to the other boy. He <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have been more right.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe chatted in bed that night about how we each could have handled it <br/>\nbetter. We thought of 3-4 ways he could have been nicer/better prepared <br/>\nand of about 20-30 ways *I* could have responded better. &lt;G&gt; He&#39;s so <br/>\nsmart! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really not that the list-owners have this all figured out. We <br/>\nstill struggle and screw up. One of our goals is to be better parents <br/>\neach and every day. That was NOT one of my better moments. I can blame <br/>\nbeing tired and hungry and out-of-sorts, but it&#39;s absolutely no <br/>\ndifferent than what my young child was going through.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe certainly deserves more empathy than I do---he has only eleven years <br/>\non this planet. I have 47 and *still* screw up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully we can build on this and be better to each other. He&#39;s *very* <br/>\nforgiving and generous with me!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
