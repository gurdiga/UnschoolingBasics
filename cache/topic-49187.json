Although learning a second language is never a bad idea, I think the colleges in other states, that will allow students to learn another language in college, rather than requiring before college, have it right. If someone who is homeschooled or unschooled decides not to go to college, and has no particular interest or need to learn a second language, then it doesn&#39;t matter if s/he never learns one.<br/>\n<br/>\nGA is pushing for more and more standardization, and imposing more and more requirements on applicants, for the public colleges. (I don&#39;t know what the larger private colleges require. I think I&#39;ll look up what Emory University, Oglethorpe, Agnes Scott, and SCAD require for applicants.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI keep hearing news reports of college enrollment in GA having gone down. Hey - let&#39;s see if we can sink from 49th to 50th in education, and be the new Mississippi!<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally think that the more they try to force every student to have had an identical education, and the more they impose their very narrow version of &quot;academic rigor&quot; on every student, the worse the state of education in this state will become.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear about all the famous universities looking for creativity, innovation, independent learning, motivation, and something unique in their applicants. And then you&#39;ve got GA looking for mass-produced cogs.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, anyway, it was because I live in GA, and my kids did not want to go out of state (yet) that I mentioned the two-years-of-foreign-language requirement. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven here in GA, there is no test to insure that a homeschooled applicant has really studied a foreign language. I *know* that the public high school kids mostly don&#39;t really *learn* the foreign language that they take in school. The majority of them just take the class, pass the tests, and then forget it. So a homeschooler could list a language on his/her transcript, and no one will ever know if s/he really studied it at all. Or a homeschooler with more integrity could study a foreign language over the summer, before starting college, and, if motivated, could learn more in one summer than an unmotivated student would learn in two years!<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":291337950,"authorName":"alma","from":"&quot;alma&quot; &lt;almadoing@...&gt;","profile":"almadoing","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: New to this and need help with my high schooler","postDate":"1351268514","msgId":49210,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGs2ZWRiMitkY2ZiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGs2YzJ2cStmaGs1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49209,"nextInTopic":49212,"prevInTime":49209,"nextInTime":49211,"topicId":49187,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... currently, his time is filled with sleeping and video games (and talking to friends via video games).

I knew that they could learn what they needed to know to get into college, if they wanted to go to college, in a year or two. And, indeed, they did! :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nThey learned through a combination of online courses (starting at about age 16), classes they chose to take with our local homeschool group over all their homeschooling years (some &quot;academic&quot;, and some in the arts and sports and handicraft skills, such as woodworking), special classes at the zoo, the Boys and Girls Club, a Comcast studio, etc, participating in Venture Scouts, volunteering at a local theater, and through the internet, books, casual conversations with lots of people, watching TV/movies/videos, and playing video games.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can manage to accept the concept of whole-life-learning, and forget, for a moment, that high schools and colleges break all knowledge into totally separate subjects, it will probably be easier for you to trust your kids to learn what they need to, when they need to. My kids did not learn biology ONLY through a formal biology course, history ONLY through a formal history course, math ONLY through formal math courses, or vocabulary/grammar/writing skills ONLY through formal English courses. *Most* of what they learned for most college-required &quot;subjects&quot; is just &quot;out there&quot; in popular culture, or came from their interactions with my husband and me and all the other people they know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing that I would recommend planning ahead for two years of study before college is a foreign language - and that&#39;s only if your teen doesn&#39;t already know a second language at all, and won&#39;t have the opportunity to learn through travel and immersion in a foreign culture or through conversing regularly with a foreigner they know in your area. (I&#39;ve known several unschooled teens who did learn a foreign language through travel and spending a year abroad.)<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, in some states, students still don&#39;t even need a foreign language at all to get into some colleges and get a degree. But studying a language for the equivalent of 2 years gives them more options later.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;danagribble@...&quot; &lt;danagribble@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been homeschooling my 14yr old son since the middle of third grade.

Many thanks, to all of you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 15 y.o. son has been unschooling for just over a year now (we followed a curriculum for several months after pulling him from public school in 7th grade); currently, his time is filled with sleeping and video games (and talking to friends via video games).  Myself having been raised in a family that esteemed an old-fashioned Puritan-style work ethic above all, I find I worry about the perils of sloth quite a bit, certainly far more than reason, reality, and experience would dictate.  The saving grace is that not only does my son have the most even temperament of any teenager I&#39;ve ever met (he&#39;s not sleep deprived!), but he reports being happy as a clam.  How can I argue with that kind of success?  However, I still struggle with cognitive dissonance, since my long-held beliefs no longer are in sync with reality (&quot;one must work hard to be happy&quot; and &quot;activity is only meaningful if it is hard/boring/hurts/not enjoyable&quot;).  Fortunately, with awareness comes ability to change, and I&#39;m working through the process, though it&#39;s taking longer than I expected.  I&#39;m getting there, though :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t actively participate much in this group, but I read every post and have since I joined.

And why that expectation can make it look like unschooling isn&#39;t working.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unschooling is creating a rich, supportive environment for kids to explore their interests in with opportunities to be exposed to potential new interests. In that environment kids grow and blossom into who they are.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My daughter&#39;s unschooling years looked a lot like drawing comics, playing video games, watching TV, reading manga together. It very rarely looked like anything done in school. *And yet* despite her lack of years of math classes, she decided to take her father&#39;s college statistics class for fun. And she ended up being at the top of the class, against students some of whom had more years of formal math than she&#39;d been alive ;-) But their math had been formulas and memorization that didn&#39;t lead to understanding. Her math had been video games and art and life that allowed her to use math concepts to pull information that she wanted from the world around her. Because she used the concepts as tools for her own needs, she had a deep understanding of what they were and what they could do for her.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *Don&#39;t* expect your son to take college statistics at 14. My daughter did well because she was doing it for fun. There were zero expectations from her. Your son&#39;s had years of pressure to do formal learning.  He needs years of no pressure to be able to see classes as a way to explore an interest rather than as a requirement to drag himself through to get to the end. He needs years of exploring in the myriad of other ways that schools can&#39;t accommodate in order to get a handle on how he learns.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (I keep saying school and classes because that&#39;s what you&#39;re vision of the &quot;best&quot; learning looks like. When in reality, that kind of learning is not only difficult since it doesn&#39;t match how humans naturally learn but also very poor in terms of retention and understanding.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now I know several of you might disagree with me, but since<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not a fan at all of video games, I just don&#39;t see a lot of value in them. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But what if your son said, &quot;I&#39;m not a big fan of [something you value highly], I just don&#39;t see a lot of value in it,&quot; would that mean his lack of appreciation meant the thing really lacked value? Or would the statement sound like it came from ignorance? Or might it mean &quot;It&#39;s just not for me?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We each have our likes and dislikes. I didn&#39;t like thrash metal or death metal. It didn&#39;t have value *for me*. But since my goal is to support my daughter&#39;s interests and explorations -- which is what unschooling is -- had I ignored my daughter&#39;s interest as lacking value, I would have shut off a big doorway between the two of us and between her and the world. To support her I saw the music through her enjoyment. I was open to her sharing. I listened when she talked about what excited her. And I gained a better understanding of metal music and of her. And I can ask insightful questions, know why she&#39;s excited about something and get excited with her.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you aren&#39;t a fan of what he enjoys, you&#39;re missing opportunities to connect with who he is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What he loves *is* who he is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This will be hard to hear -- and it&#39;s a trap so many parents fall into -- is you want the best for him.

A math class to get a better grasp of notation. A writing class to get a better grasp of the writing form colleges will expect papers to be in. There may be a few more, but that&#39;s generally it. And that&#39;s because if an unschooled kid wants to go into science, they&#39;ve been doing science. If they want to go into history, they&#39;ve been doing history. (Though it may not look like such! Their explorations might not have looked like school science and history.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The thing is that home schooled kids get the chance to be *different* from the 1000s of applicants colleges get.

And why that expectation can make it look like unschooling isn&#39;t working.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is creating a rich, supportive environment for kids to explore their interests in with opportunities to be exposed to potential new interests. In that environment kids grow and blossom into who they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter&#39;s unschooling years looked a lot like drawing comics, playing video games, watching TV, reading manga together. It very rarely looked like anything done in school. *And yet* despite her lack of years of math classes, she decided to take her father&#39;s college statistics class for fun. And she ended up being at the top of the class, against students some of whom had more years of formal math than she&#39;d been alive ;-) But their math had been formulas and memorization that didn&#39;t lead to understanding. Her math had been video games and art and life that allowed her to use math concepts to pull information that she wanted from the world around her. Because she used the concepts as tools for her own needs, she had a deep understanding of what they were and what they could do for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Don&#39;t* expect your son to take college statistics at 14. My daughter did well because she was doing it for fun. There were zero expectations from her. Your son&#39;s had years of pressure to do formal learning.  He needs years of no pressure to be able to see classes as a way to explore an interest rather than as a requirement to drag himself through to get to the end. He needs years of exploring in the myriad of other ways that schools can&#39;t accommodate in order to get a handle on how he learns.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I keep saying school and classes because that&#39;s what you&#39;re vision of the &quot;best&quot; learning looks like. When in reality, that kind of learning is not only difficult since it doesn&#39;t match how humans naturally learn but also very poor in terms of retention and understanding.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now I know several of you might disagree with me, but since<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not a fan at all of video games, I just don&#39;t see a lot of value in them. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But what if your son said, &quot;I&#39;m not a big fan of [something you value highly], I just don&#39;t see a lot of value in it,&quot; would that mean his lack of appreciation meant the thing really lacked value? Or would the statement sound like it came from ignorance? Or might it mean &quot;It&#39;s just not for me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe each have our likes and dislikes. I didn&#39;t like thrash metal or death metal. It didn&#39;t have value *for me*. But since my goal is to support my daughter&#39;s interests and explorations -- which is what unschooling is -- had I ignored my daughter&#39;s interest as lacking value, I would have shut off a big doorway between the two of us and between her and the world. To support her I saw the music through her enjoyment. I was open to her sharing. I listened when she talked about what excited her. And I gained a better understanding of metal music and of her. And I can ask insightful questions, know why she&#39;s excited about something and get excited with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you aren&#39;t a fan of what he enjoys, you&#39;re missing opportunities to connect with who he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he loves *is* who he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will be hard to hear -- and it&#39;s a trap so many parents fall into -- is you want the best for him. But by focusing on &quot;the best&quot; you&#39;re creating an ideal you&#39;re trying to mold him into. And you&#39;re focusing your attention on the ideal rather than on him. So when he does things that he enjoys, that are a part of who he is, that don&#39;t fit with your ideal, you get upset with him for not living up to his potential.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine happily living your life and realizing you happiness is disappointing someone you love?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if your personal interest that brought joy into your life was baking Italian pastries? Or reading bodice busters? Or sewing quilts? Or hiking? What if you found out your husband was disappointed that you weren&#39;t spending your free time living up to what he believed you could be? Wouldn&#39;t it feel like it wasn&#39;t you he loved but some ideal he wanted you to be?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems so wonderful to want the best for our kids. But what&#39;s really best for *anyone* is support in exploring who they are, not in who we believe they could be. *If* who they could be *is* who they have a burning desire to be, that&#39;s who they&#39;ll be. Even if it doesn&#39;t look like they&#39;re headed there. Real learning takes convoluted paths through interests that can seem dead end and worthless. (Like video games. Like teen dramas on TV. Like texting friends.) But if those interests fascinate someone, they&#39;re pulling a great deal of learning from them that&#39;s important to who they are and what fascinates them about life. And it&#39;s far deeper than it looks on the surface.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is what humans do. We want to understand how the world works. Unless well meaning teachers (and parents) try to get a child to *look* like he&#39;s learning in a way that eases the worries of adults.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So here we are in what would be considered his freshman year of high school<br/>\n&gt; and this school year (or whatever you want to call it) has gone from bad to worse.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The undamaged part of him is calling it life of a 14 yo.

I would call us eclectic homeschoolers at best. My son is highly gifted, but not academic AT ALL. It&#39;s been challenging for all of these years to get him to produce much of anything. He has always been a much more hands on learner rather than a book learner, which I respect and and have tried to accommodate. In the back of my mind I always thought about unschooling him, but there was always that voice in my head saying to me, &quot;He will just play video games all day.&quot; Now I know several of you might disagree with me, but since I&#39;m not a fan at all of video games, I just don&#39;t see a lot of value in them. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo here we are in what would be considered his freshman year of high school and this school year (or whatever you want to call it) has gone from bad to worse. He wants to go to college, but at a time in his life when the requirements are so much greater, I&#39;m still not getting much from him. It&#39;s very frustrating to watch such a smart kid with what looks like no goals in mind at all. My husband and I have talked to our son and we have decided to unschool him and let our son just find his own way. He did tell us what classes and subjects he wants to drop this year and which ones he wants to continue with. We told him we support whatever decision he makes. Now we are letting our son self-direct/unschool, whatever you want to call it, but he&#39;s still not doing much even with the subjects he has decided he wants to keep doing. I almost feel like we need to deschool from our eclectic approach to homeschooling. It seems like all he wants to do is get on his lap top, text friends, play video games and sleep (which I get since he&#39;s a teen). Help! What to do with a smart kid who just seems to lack any motivation?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49217,"nextTopicId":49221}}
