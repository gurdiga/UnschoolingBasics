However, I believe firmly that REALLY unhealthy food choices can be just as fatal and harmful as drug addiction. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;m a nurse. I&#39;ve seen the long term fallout from people who ate nothing but junk. Now, I will admit that probably a lot of that behaviour came from comments about their weight, force-feeding by parents (I tell my kids &quot;just eat however much you want, you don&#39;t have to finish&quot;) and a lifetime of living in food deserts - places where healthy food wasn&#39;t available, or was incredibly expensive. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  But it&#39;s brutal to have to watch someone suffer because they have ballooned up to 400+ pounds. To need insulin to survive. To need a walker to ambulate, to need a trapeze to turn over in bed. To need a bi-pap machine to breathe while sleeping. It&#39;s hard to watch them suffer. All I can do is support them, help as best I can, and assure them that they are still beautiful to ME. But to see all that and know it was totally preventable? It&#39;s hard. I won&#39;t provide my kids with the tools of their own destruction. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Oh, and by the way, I&#39;ve raised two stepkids. With the same food rules (eat what you like, when you are hungry - but with no junk food in the house, but at friend&#39;s houses, eat whatever you like) and they are fine, healthy, eat a reasonable diet, and have never been overweight. They eat some junk, occasionally, but it&#39;s rare. Real rare. And we all get along fine and it&#39;s never been a source of conflict. They both have jobs, are fit, are happily married, are happy and functional human beings who seem at peace with themselves. They&#39;ve never been in trouble with the law, etc. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  So yeah, even though my kids are young at this point, I *have* raised school age and teenage kids and know all about that, and can say I&#39;ve done it sucessfully. <br/>\n<br/>\n  --- On Mon, 9/14/09, gruvystarchild &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: gruvystarchild &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Daughter&#39;s weight gain<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Date: Monday, September 14, 2009, 11:17 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~I have to agree with Jenna here. I personally don&#39;t believe that supporting products like Cool ranch doritos is healthy for a society. It&#39;s not food, it&#39;s a bunch of chemicals, altered starches, and the packaging, promotion of them on media, and food miles involved don&#39;t fit with my belief system. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\n  Seeing it as a &quot;bunch of chemicals&quot; won&#39;t help anyone think clearly about this topic. What fits in with YOUR belief system isn&#39;t what we&#39;re talking about. We&#39;re talking about how to treat your children in regards to their desires about food. How to honor your own needs about food, and still not lay down heavy judgment on your children is something we can give lots of input about. We&#39;re not hear to support any one person&#39;s food &quot;belief system&quot; and I really hope parents can think outside of a &quot;belief system&quot; for food. Society is full of enough pressure, judgment and rules without having a whole religion about food!;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~I don&#39;t limit what my kids can have in the house, since we just don&#39;t buy this junk. I don&#39;t have bags and bowls of candy and chips available, just as we don&#39;t keep crack and heroin freely available, or packs of marlboros available for them to &quot;experiment and learn&quot; with. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\n  Comparing candy and chips to crack and heroin is pretty outrageous. Would you like to talk about true drug addiction? Because I have a brother who has lived most of his adult life in prison and I can tell you about the effects of drug addiction. It doesn&#39;t look anything like chips and candy and that very idea is offensive to me. Chips and candy don&#39;t cause you to go an beat people up to get more. Chips and candy don&#39;t make you forget who you are or make you want to get more so badly you do awful things to people. Chips and candy don&#39;t land you in jail and ruin lives. Don&#39;t compare FOOD to drug addiction... it&#39;s inflammatory and completely illogical.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~As my two grow older, I&#39;ll be encouraging them to actually research where this stuff comes from. And the effects nutritionally empty foods have on society and the long term health of people and a society. Then, once they&#39;ve proved they are fully educated? Then at that point, if they decide they want to participated in such a broken system, they can.~~<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you do the above and they make choices you don&#39;t approve of, all you&#39;ve done is damage their relationship with you. As the mother of a grown kid and some that are close to being grown, I can PROMISE you they will make choices you disagree with at some point. If you&#39;re raising children with the hopes of them always choosing what you approve of, good luck. In the mean time, the judgment and pushing might hurt your communication with them. They&#39;ll learn to hide certain things from you.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Like everything else, children will learn about food from modeling and curiosity much better than &quot;encouraging&quot; or judgment.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~But I&#39;m not going to enable bad eating habits in kids too young to understand the complexities of lab-designed frankenfood. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\n  This shows a huge lack of trust. If you did let your children choose what they eat, what is going to happen? Do you not trust them to feel their own bodies and what they need? Kids are actually pretty good at this when not controlled. They&#39;ll learn over time. Providing healthy food is great....but fearing their ability just because they&#39;re young isn&#39;t a great start for long-term healthy habits.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t keep everything and anything available at my house either (who could..it&#39;s just not possible)... but when my children ask for something I don&#39;t lay down heavy guilt and start in with words like &quot;frankenfood&quot; and other such nonsense. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Keep in mind, we garden, keep bees and are very concerned about the food supply. If *I* can learn to trust food choices, anyone can. It&#39;s a matter of putting your childs freedom ahead of your &quot;belief system&quot;. Or better yet, letting go of &quot;belief systems&quot; and living life fully. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n  radicalunschooling. blogspot. com<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"Karen Swanay &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Daughter&#39;s weight gain","postDate":"1252945111","msgId":41321,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDkwOTE0MDkxOGwyOTJhZDFmOG1lNDEwOGYxOGM2Yzc1NjkyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUyMzM3NS43MTE5NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTAyMDkubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDkwOTE0MDgyMmgxNWQ4M2QxMWg4YWQxNWQ2ZDE2ZjQxZDgwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiAJPDUyMzM3NS43MTE5NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTAyMDkubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41320,"nextInTopic":41322,"prevInTime":41320,"nextInTime":41322,"topicId":41292,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I almost choked on my water when I read this...lmao.

In fact she is so severely diabetic that she must have an insulin pump. She&#39;s had a lifetime of diabetes and eating healthy.

However, I believe firmly that REALLY unhealthy food choices can be just as fatal and harmful as drug addiction. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m a nurse. I&#39;ve seen the long term fallout from people who ate nothing but junk. Now, I will admit that probably a lot of that behaviour came from comments about their weight, force-feeding by parents (I tell my kids &quot;just eat however much you want, you don&#39;t have to finish&quot;) and a lifetime of living in food deserts - places where healthy food wasn&#39;t available, or was incredibly expensive. <br/>\n <br/>\nBut it&#39;s brutal to have to watch someone suffer because they have ballooned up to 400+ pounds. To need insulin to survive. To need a walker to ambulate, to need a trapeze to turn over in bed. To need a bi-pap machine to breathe while sleeping. It&#39;s hard to watch them suffer. All I can do is support them, help as best I can, and assure them that they are still beautiful to ME. But to see all that and know it was totally preventable? It&#39;s hard. I won&#39;t provide my kids with the tools of their own destruction. <br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and by the way, I&#39;ve raised two stepkids. With the same food rules (eat what you like, when you are hungry - but with no junk food in the house, but at friend&#39;s houses, eat whatever you like) and they are fine, healthy, eat a reasonable diet, and have never been overweight. They eat some junk, occasionally, but it&#39;s rare. Real rare. And we all get along fine and it&#39;s never been a source of conflict. They both have jobs, are fit, are happily married, are happy and functional human beings who seem at peace with themselves. They&#39;ve never been in trouble with the law, etc. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo yeah, even though my kids are young at this point, I *have* raised school age and teenage kids and know all about that, and can say I&#39;ve done it sucessfully. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Mon, 9/14/09, gruvystarchild &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: gruvystarchild &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Daughter&#39;s weight gain<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Monday, September 14, 2009, 11:17 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~I have to agree with Jenna here.

I personally don&#39;t believe that supporting products like Cool ranch doritos is healthy for a society.

It&#39;s why my neice is so very excited at the idea of being 18 and getting to drink. Much of what she talks about is what and how much she&#39;s gonna drink when she&#39;s of age (it&#39;s 18 in the UK). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Simon and Linnaea have not been restricted ever.Today Simon grabbed a bag of Doritos cool ranch chips and walked to the computer. I asked if he&#39;d like a tuna sandwich and he said yes and put the chips back. He was hungry and went for an easy option. Having a choice of something that took a moment of work and a bit of awareness of what was in the pantry changed what he wanted. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Give her time. Girls are particularly sensitive to food controls. There&#39;s good data on girls&#39; responses to parental food restrictions that suggests that they have an extreme response to those controls. Thus girls are more likely to either binge on controlled food or move toward anorexia or bulemia. Do what you can to see it as a gift that you are giving your daughter. When she&#39;s 18 she won&#39;t be focused on what she couldn&#39;t have a child. She&#39;ll have the time to focus on other things and other parts of her life. And she&#39;ll be more likely to eat when she&#39;s hungry and stop when she&#39;s full. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Schuyler<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________<br/>\n&gt; From: observeandlearn &lt;kathryndubay@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, 13 September, 2009 6:31:48 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Daughter&#39;s weight gain<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello all -- an issue that&#39;s in my and my partner&#39;s mind is my daughter&#39;s weight gain since food restrictions were lifted.  Just to give you a little history, prior to our children going &#39;free range&#39; I had a pretty tight belt on all processed foods.  As of Easter this year, I let go and allow them to eat what they want, when they want.  Meals and platters are still served as usual, but they now have access to all sorts of lollies, soft drinks, chips, crackers, etc, that were simply not bought in the recent past, or unlimited.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mia is 7 and has had my values/understanding on food really pushed on her in the past.  I worry that this past preaching has done long term damage.  I understand that there is a strong element of &#39;defooding&#39; going on here.  She has a good balance; she eats her meals as well as snacks continuously on the sweets, etc.  But the weight gain is fairly significant, and my fear of her continuing to expand is always in the back of my mind.    <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She is aware of her weight gain, as her clothes suddenly do not fit her, and she is now wearing sizes that are up to 3 times larger than her ideal!  This is the same girl that used to wear clothes 3 times smaller than her ideal . . . obviously, there as an element of &#39;growth spurt&#39; going on here too.  Would love to hear others opinions and/or similar life experiences.  I just know there is some piece of the puzzle here that I&#39;m not seeing/perceiving.  I do drop comments here and there implying her weight gain is related to her intake of processed foods.  Should I not?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance for your advice,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kathryn D  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

You are passing on food focuses and phobias similar to the ones your father passed to you. <br/>\n<br/>\nLiving within a budget doesn&#39;t mean excluding foods that are appealing. I make candy. I make mints and sherbet (like lik-m-aid/fun dip powder) and toffee and fudge and other hard candies. There are lots of recipes on-line. Cookies and cakes and brownies are easy and cheap to make. If you have them in your home it will free your daughters up to use the pocket money you give them for other things and it will free them up to not see the candy from the gas station as the best thing to buy with the little cash they have. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Jenna Robertson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamamole@...\">mamamole@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, 13 September, 2009 9:40:24 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Daughter&#39;s weight gain<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 3 daughters ages 8 1/2, just turned 10 and almost 13.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe are a vegetarian family and I try to explain to my girls why we eat healthy and what our bodies need to grow and fight off germ, etc. without putting an emphasis on weight.  I come from a very controlling family and we recently visited my parents.  My father thinks every woman should be thin and made that very clear when my sister and I were growing up AND he thinks you should eat everything on your plate!  While visiting my husband and I gained weight as we would secretly eat the foods our daughters didn&#39;t like (one of them is very selective in the foods she likes and how they are prepared) or when their servings were too big and they didn&#39;t want to finish them.<br/>\n <br/>\nHaving tried to avoid processed foods as much as possible and having a strong dislike for all the holidays that seem to have become centered around selling as much cheep crappy candy as possible, it has been hard for me to let go controlling food AND not making comments about crappy candy.  (my kids have been know to snatch a candy wrapper out of my hand and yell, &quot;NO!

If you control something, releasing controls doesn&#39;t get you balance, it gets you a period when they are absolutely bingeing on the controlled good. It&#39;s why my neice is so very excited at the idea of being 18 and getting to drink. Much of what she talks about is what and how much she&#39;s gonna drink when she&#39;s of age (it&#39;s 18 in the UK). <br/>\n<br/>\nSimon and Linnaea have not been restricted ever.Today Simon grabbed a bag of Doritos cool ranch chips and walked to the computer. I asked if he&#39;d like a tuna sandwich and he said yes and put the chips back. He was hungry and went for an easy option. Having a choice of something that took a moment of work and a bit of awareness of what was in the pantry changed what he wanted. <br/>\n<br/>\nGive her time. Girls are particularly sensitive to food controls. There&#39;s good data on girls&#39; responses to parental food restrictions that suggests that they have an extreme response to those controls. Thus girls are more likely to either binge on controlled food or move toward anorexia or bulemia. Do what you can to see it as a gift that you are giving your daughter. When she&#39;s 18 she won&#39;t be focused on what she couldn&#39;t have a child. She&#39;ll have the time to focus on other things and other parts of her life. And she&#39;ll be more likely to eat when she&#39;s hungry and stop when she&#39;s full. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: observeandlearn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kathryndubay@...\">kathryndubay@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, 13 September, 2009 6:31:48 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Daughter&#39;s weight gain<br/>\n<br/>\nHello all -- an issue that&#39;s in my and my partner&#39;s mind is my daughter&#39;s weight gain since food restrictions were lifted.  Just to give you a little history, prior to our children going &#39;free range&#39; I had a pretty tight belt on all processed foods.  As of Easter this year, I let go and allow them to eat what they want, when they want.  Meals and platters are still served as usual, but they now have access to all sorts of lollies, soft drinks, chips, crackers, etc, that were simply not bought in the recent past, or unlimited.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMia is 7 and has had my values/understanding on food really pushed on her in the past.  I worry that this past preaching has done long term damage.  I understand that there is a strong element of &#39;defooding&#39; going on here.  She has a good balance; she eats her meals as well as snacks continuously on the sweets, etc.  But the weight gain is fairly significant, and my fear of her continuing to expand is always in the back of my mind.    <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is aware of her weight gain, as her clothes suddenly do not fit her, and she is now wearing sizes that are up to 3 times larger than her ideal!  This is the same girl that used to wear clothes 3 times smaller than her ideal . . . obviously, there as an element of &#39;growth spurt&#39; going on here too.  Would love to hear others opinions and/or similar life experiences.  I just know there is some piece of the puzzle here that I&#39;m not seeing/perceiving.  I do drop comments here and there implying her weight gain is related to her intake of processed foods.  Should I not?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your advice,<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn D  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

And explain why. Not every time. But certainly if they ask. <br/>\nNot in lecturing way. In an informational way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had a humongous bowl of M&Ms in our den for years now. No Lovejoys eat M&Ms any more. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nGuests do though! A lot! &lt;g&gt; I also have a bowl of cashews or almonds in the *other* bowl. <br/>\nIt took a couple of years for us to stop eating M&Ms, but the infatuation is gone. We *all*<br/>\nseem to choose the nuts now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can use the M&Ms as a barometer though. One handful---I don&#39;t concern myself. Two---maybe.<br/>\nBut three, and I ask whether the child is hungry. Inevitably he *is* (or *I* am! &lt;g&gt;). So I can<br/>\noffer a better alternative. It&#39;s always met with gratitude because he *was* hungry, but the M&M <br/>\nbowl was handy. I can whip up a quesadilla or a monkey platter a whole lot more quickly than they <br/>\ncan.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeemingly apparent weight gain and loss is sooo common in children as they grow out and then up. My mother was whining <br/>\nabout how big Duncan was getting. But I knew it was just the stage before puberty when he was storing body fat before <br/>\nshooting UP. He still has a little baby fat, but he&#39;s gotten sooo tall lately (suddenly taller than I am!) that, if he *hadn&#39;t* <br/>\ngained that weight a year or three ago, he would have looked like a scrawny scarecrow this past year!<br/>\n<br/>\nPatience and a helpful, healthful attitude about food is the best course.

I am a &#39;health nut&#39; and shared many  <br/>\neating ideas with Dr. Sears. I was a nice controller, sweetly keeping  <br/>\nthe &#39;bad&#39; stuff from my children out of love. It didn&#39;t work. They  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t feel loved they felt controlled, rightly so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started to become more flexible when I learned about RU. My dd then  <br/>\n8-9 did gain a bit a weight. It wasn&#39;t a big deal. It&#39;s her body and I  <br/>\nwanted her to be comfortable in her body. I was cautious not to say  <br/>\nanything that might damage her Self. Being heavy isn&#39;t bad. It is also  <br/>\nlikely a swing in the pendulum. As much as SHE felt controlled, she  <br/>\nwill swing the other way. The more you give it energy, fear, and  <br/>\nattention the longer she&#39;ll stay there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t keep unlimited sweets in the house but I DO purchase whatever  <br/>\nmy kids want. And I will also not purchase things they ask to keep  <br/>\naway. Recently at the store Zola 2 asked for cheetos, Easy6 asked for  <br/>\ngranola, and Malila12 asked for soda. That&#39;s what I got in addition to  <br/>\nour meals. There was a time when they asked for more candies and  <br/>\nsweets. But it has balanced out. They ask for specific cheeses, fruits  <br/>\nand veggies as well. They surely don&#39;t eat a Dr. Sears approved diet  <br/>\nbut they are healthy and happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nM12 asked to keep soda out of the house for a few months. She loves  <br/>\nsoda. She felt like she was consuming too much. It was making her feel  <br/>\nbad but she needed help. She is my child that was controlled the  <br/>\nlongest. The other two were never controlled and it is much different.  <br/>\nThey are more self regulated. I think it took about 2 years for her to  <br/>\nfeel like she had autonomy. And part of that was waxing and waning on  <br/>\nmy side and part is her personality.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead a bunch of blogs on food and RU. Sandra Dodd and Joyce Fetteroll  <br/>\nhave a wealth of information on their sites.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sep 13, 2009, at 1:31 AM, &quot;observeandlearn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kathryndubay@...\">kathryndubay@...</a> <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello all -- an issue that&#39;s in my and my partner&#39;s mind is my  <br/>\n&gt; daughter&#39;s weight gain since food restrictions were lifted.
