They&#39;re down in southeastern CT (Guilford I think) and the <br/>\ngatherings are typically on Saturdays (so working folks can attend).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we&#39;re getting a small unschooling group together in the <br/>\nManchester CT area - contact me offline if you&#39;re interested. So far <br/>\nit&#39;s about half a dozen families getting together once a month. <br/>\nThey&#39;re during the week though - alternating months between days and <br/>\nevenings. In May it&#39;s a daytime, park day type thing. June will be an <br/>\nevening thing. and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2346607,"authorName":"ohpurple1@aol.com","from":"ohpurple1@...","profile":"openmindedfamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Unschooling Events?","postDate":"1147359676","msgId":12969,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM1ZS40M2Q4ZTdjLjMxOTRhYmJjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12973,"prevInTime":12968,"nextInTime":12970,"topicId":12969,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/10/2006 5:19:33 PM Eastern Standard Time, kbcdlovejo@aol.com writes: can t suggest enough to attend a conference.

He needs to see there are other <br/>\nfamilies who live like we do and let their children live in freedom.  He is in a <br/>\ncoasting mode right now, sort of letting us be.  He still encourages me to <br/>\nteach the kids what he thinks we need to teach, though.  He goes nuts when my 6 <br/>\nyear old asks if he can have ice cream for breakfast and I tell him to eat <br/>\nwhatever he wants. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, dh really likes the &quot;rewind&quot; which I have been using when <br/>\nI hear my mother&#39;s words coming from my mouth.

BTW, I got How Children Learn and How <br/>\nChildren Fail and offered them to him to help him understand the changes he was <br/>\nliving but he has not opened one yet, two months later.
