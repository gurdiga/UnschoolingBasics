My oldest ds23 is a senior at North Carolina State","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1945554775\">Just thought as an older unschool mom I would chime in and give a few success stories...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest ds23 is a senior at North Carolina State University...originally he knew he wanted to go to college and so he began taking classes at the community college when he was 16~  after trying a few courses of study he realized he loved statistics and will graduate with a degree in sociology with a minor in statistics..While in college he has learned blues guitar from a homeless man in the downtown area, photo a book of several homeless folks and interviewed their stories ( this is his senior internship), dabbled in hydroponics and salt water aquariums and authentic Chinese cooking... not to mention he now fishes and golfs.  I&#39;ll be really suprised if he stops here and doesn&#39;t go for a masters.. he loves school and it has offered him alot of variety.<br/>\n<br/>\nds21 decided when he was 16 that he would just study the Microsoft Certification books until he turned 18 and then take the test... He didn&#39;t have a lick of structured schooling but aced the test with no problem without having to take an expensive class.  He now feels like he has hit a dead end personally and has been accepted on a provisional to NCSU in Jan.  He will finally have to take higher math and the SAT&#39;s which he has been avoiding... He simply looks at this as a skill...<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nds18 has always waanted to be a probation officer... He is in community college and has been since he was 16.. He will graduate next year although he can not apply for a job until he is 21 so he is going to do alot of backpacking across the country...He did have to take a place ment test a the community college .. he is required to take algebra...<br/>\n<br/>\nThey all scored very well on placement tests in verbal and writing... We don&#39;t do the TV thing much and have opted to read for entertainment... While we try to cut our own path, we really were inspired by the book &quot; Hard Times in Paradise&quot; by David and Miki Colfax.  w even had the pleasure of having coffee with them and they really gave us a push to unschool and crve out a little farmstead.  It did wonders for our family....<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... I guess I am writing this to encourage younger unschool families that it DOES work... and when all around you are doing Abeka, trust your kiddos to make great decisions to their interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest is 13 and he looks to his 23 yo brother as a role model.  He chooses to study certain things, seeing it as a stepping stone to a goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this encourages!<br/>\n<br/>\nLea<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://minwifeof4boys.bravejournal.com/\">http://minwifeof4boys.bravejournal.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nY!
