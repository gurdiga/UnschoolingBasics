Have you called the school<br/>\ndistrict (sometimes school districts have contact information for<br/>\nlocal homeschool groups.)  If you can&#39;t find unschoolers specifically<br/>\nsearch out homeschool groups because sometimes unschoolers are &quot;lost&quot;<br/>\namongst the ranks of traditional homeschoolers as they can&#39;t find<br/>\nothers either :)  I believe that there are a few message boards for<br/>\nunschoolers around where you can post a &quot;looking for unschoolers in<br/>\n_____&quot; type posts.  And if all that fails, start your own unschooling<br/>\nyahoogroup and sit back and see what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing a quick google search I did find this group:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SecularHomeEducators/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SecularHomeEducators/</a> which (according<br/>\nto Jon&#39;s homeschool resource pages) seems to be located in or near<br/>\nWhittier.  Sometimes you just have to be creative with your searches<br/>\nand the words you use.  Try using words like secular, inclusive,<br/>\nnon-coercive, relaxed, peaceful, gentle, non-religious.  While you may<br/>\nnot find a bunch of unschoolers you may find people who are at least<br/>\ngentle and loving with their children.  That&#39;s the one thing going for<br/>\nthe group I&#39;m in.  While there are only a small handful of true<br/>\nradical unschoolers, the other families treat their children with love<br/>\nand respect, which I didn&#39;t find in the other (big old mean)<br/>\nhomeschool group.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Support Groups","postDate":"1155827604","msgId":16534,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVjMjEyays1cDVsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVjMTE5MSs4Zjg0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16532,"nextInTopic":16536,"prevInTime":16533,"nextInTime":16535,"topicId":16532,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
