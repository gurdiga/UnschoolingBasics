It was very affirming to hear thehealing effects of unschooling on your son.  I have a another son, who is 12, and he, too, still likes to hug and hold handswith me, which I think is a result of the unschooling and the attachment /connection parenting that we do at home.  I had a friend, who was a school-at-home mom.  Her family has since moved,but I remember her sharing the bit of sadness she felt when she happenedto put her arm around her 10 year-old son as they were walking outside, and he quickly reeled around to avoid that closeness.  But she just chalked it up to boys being boys and her son being older.  Of course, it was *normal* for boyshis age not to enjoy physical affection anymore.  I felt sad for her, too.I wish everyone could recognize the benefits of unschooling / attachment parenting.They (and we -- in fact, the whole world) would be better off!Shelley<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":110000787,"authorName":"Quinn Blaiklock","from":"&quot;Quinn Blaiklock&quot; &lt;organized@...&gt;","profile":"rawsomquinn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"bullying - another perspective","postDate":"1238629978","msgId":39238,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUwNGFkMDFjOWIzMjQkZmMxOWU1YzAkMDg2YTAxMGFAbWFpbDJ3b3JsZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39250,"prevInTime":39237,"nextInTime":39239,"topicId":39238,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Greetings all!

My son was the bully in school; way too<br/>\nclever for his own good and saw that verbal jabs were much more fun than<br/>\nphysical ones.  He was the one in the circle to say something nasty to<br/>\none of the members, everyone would laugh, and then the jabbed person<br/>\nwould say &quot;Hey, wait a minute ...&quot;  Luckily for us, we had a great<br/>\nrelationship with the small school and were able to work from both home<br/>\nand school and with the bullied family.  He had great potential for<br/>\nbeing a social deviant since his morality growth spurt has not quite<br/>\nkicked in yet.<br/>\n <br/>\nHomeschooling was the key to bringing this behavior to an end.  We<br/>\nstarted when he was nine.  He is now thirteen, still scarily clever, and<br/>\nusing his powers for (mostly) good.  He is gentle with babies and wee<br/>\nones, respectful of adults, and a crazy lunatic with his peers, but all<br/>\nwithout malice or harshness.  Well, I was going to say that we were<br/>\nlucky, but I do believe it was homeschooling and unschooling (I&#39;m<br/>\nworking on it!) that shifted it.  I adore my son, my daughter is having<br/>\na great relationship with him, bumps and all, and I actually now love<br/>\nthe idea of parenting teenagers!  Thank you unschooling and<br/>\nhomeschooling and everything that has to do with direct parent<br/>\ninvolvement.  The boy even holds hands with me occasionally: &quot;Holding<br/>\nhands with you is like a private, small hug&quot; in public.<br/>\n <br/>\nblessings and peace to all,<br/>\nQuinn<br/>\n <br/>\nIt is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of<br/>\ninstruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of<br/>\ninquiry; for what this delicate little plant needs more than anything,<br/>\nbesides stimulation, is freedom. It is a very grave mistake to think<br/>\nthat the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of<br/>\ncoercion and a sense of duty.<br/>\n                                                            ~Albert<br/>\nEinstein<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://toolbar.Care2.com&quot;&gt;http://toolbar.Care2.com&lt;/a&gt;  Make your computer carbon-neutral (free).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Care2.com&quot;&gt;http://www.Care2.com&lt;/a&gt; Green Living, Human Rights and more - 8 million members!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39234,"nextTopicId":39258}}
