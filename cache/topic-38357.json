A lot depends on the neighborhood, but you do not have to be in<br/>\na &quot;fancy&quot; or &quot;expensive&quot; area to feel safe.as long as you are comfortable<br/>\nwith people of many shades and cultures.FL is a real melting pot. On the<br/>\nother hand there are lovely rural towns that feel like any other southern<br/>\nsmall town, it really depends where you are. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the job situation, I can only speak anecdotally, however FL is<br/>\nfull of elderly and boomers, so I would assume employment as a nurse is easy<br/>\nto come by.in addition to hospitals, assisted  care facilities, nursing<br/>\nhomes, dr offices ect,  private care nurses are in high demand. As far as<br/>\npainters go..well FL is one of the epicenters of the current real estate<br/>\nfiasco, and in a time when belts are tightening maybe that is something<br/>\npeople will skimp on.but I really can&#39;t say.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, hope this answers some of your concerns regarding gangs;  the Miami<br/>\nof the 80&#39;s (Miami vice, German tourist shootings, and carjacking) is really<br/>\na thing of the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\n<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38243,"nextTopicId":38359}}
