He&#39;ll have watched everything on TV until he <br/>\nwants no more, and he&#39;ll crawl out of the deschooling with a passion so <br/>\nbig you won&#39;t know what hit you! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Emily---she&#39;s showing you that *she* is more than capable of <br/>\nlearning on her own. It&#39;s cool that she can see that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Burke---well he&#39;s a smart little bugger, huh? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing outside of the unschooling home probably *will* set them back a <br/>\nbit. I&#39;m afraid that they may come doubting their ability to learn <br/>\nwithout school---but it won&#39;t throw all the way back to the beginning. <br/>\nJust a step or two back. I tried to keep Cameron away from in-laws and <br/>\nanyone who would tease/hurt him in any way if I couldn&#39;t be right there <br/>\nto stop it. It still happened, and he would seem a little bummed for a <br/>\nwhile---and not much I could say would fix it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut *YOU* have BURKE! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope it&#39;s good when they get back home---I know you miss them!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
