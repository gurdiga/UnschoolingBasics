But unschooling tells us that forcing our children to endure <br/>\nactivities that neither interest them or are comfortable for them is <br/>\njust not wrong.  Some children would love going shopping with mom.  <br/>\nThey would be all immersed into the &quot;art of shoe shopping&quot; and find <br/>\ntrying on countless pairs of shoes fun and entertaining.  Other (I <br/>\nmight even say most) children would be bored to tears and find it <br/>\ninsufferable.  I also don&#39;t think that I should make my child &quot;be <br/>\ngood&quot; so that they can do something that they enjoy afterwards.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m fortunate now that my children are old enough to stay home alone <br/>\nfor more than an hour at a time.  When I have a shopping venture <br/>\nthat I want to run they have the option of going or staying home.  <br/>\nThey know that if they come that it might be boring to them and that <br/>\nthey are going somewhere that they have no interest in.  Sometimes, <br/>\nthey just want to go to spend a little time with me or they may feel <br/>\nhousebound because of weather or health issues that going office <br/>\nsupply shopping with mom is more exciting than spending another <br/>\nminute in the house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that is a little clearer mud,<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157089938,"authorName":"S Drag-teine","from":"&quot;S Drag-teine&quot; &lt;dragteine@...&gt;","profile":"dragteine76","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: On a leash","postDate":"1142883377","msgId":10944,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGYwMWM2NGM1NSQ4ZmFlMTcwMCQwZDY5ZjdhNUBob21lY3B1MjAwNjAxMD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGR2bW02bythdjkxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10942,"nextInTopic":10948,"prevInTime":10943,"nextInTime":10945,"topicId":10912,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t know that that is fair.

I just think there are <br/>\n&gt; better <br/>\n&gt; ways (such as attentive parenting) to keep children safe.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of our children used to be a &quot;dawdler.&quot;  She was in no hurry <br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; get anywhere.  She took (and still takes) life at her own speed.  <br/>\n&gt; When <br/>\n&gt; we would go to Disney World, this could be a problem as she would <br/>\n&gt; be <br/>\n&gt; one step behind me, then 2, then 5, then somewhere else <br/>\n&gt; altogether.  <br/>\n&gt; We solved this by attaching bells to her shoes.  (Actually we had <br/>\n&gt; them <br/>\n&gt; on both the girl&#39;s shoes, but had jingle bells on one and small <br/>\n&gt; cow-<br/>\n&gt; looking bells on the other - different sounds.)  We could tell <br/>\n&gt; when <br/>\n&gt; she was lagging behind or had gotten &quot;off course.&quot;  She loved her <br/>\n&gt; shoes (she had tennis shoes that I had painted like cow print) and <br/>\n&gt; her <br/>\n&gt; bells and would ring them for everyone.  Our other child thought <br/>\n&gt; that <br/>\n&gt; her bells were wonderful because it was like having little fairies <br/>\n&gt; at <br/>\n&gt; her toes.  And we never lost either of them this way.  It was a <br/>\n&gt; great <br/>\n&gt; auditory reminder of where our children were.  We later <br/>\n&gt; implimented <br/>\n&gt; this same bell theory with our son.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think leashes are more for parents&#39; convenience than anything else.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Michelle - who sometimes is around, but is always round :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I just think there are better <br/>\nways (such as attentive parenting) to keep children safe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of our children used to be a &quot;dawdler.&quot;  She was in no hurry to <br/>\nget anywhere.  She took (and still takes) life at her own speed.  When <br/>\nwe would go to Disney World, this could be a problem as she would be <br/>\none step behind me, then 2, then 5, then somewhere else altogether.  <br/>\nWe solved this by attaching bells to her shoes.  (Actually we had them <br/>\non both the girl&#39;s shoes, but had jingle bells on one and small cow-<br/>\nlooking bells on the other - different sounds.)  We could tell when <br/>\nshe was lagging behind or had gotten &quot;off course.&quot;  She loved her <br/>\nshoes (she had tennis shoes that I had painted like cow print) and her <br/>\nbells and would ring them for everyone.  Our other child thought that <br/>\nher bells were wonderful because it was like having little fairies at <br/>\nher toes.  And we never lost either of them this way.  It was a great <br/>\nauditory reminder of where our children were.  We later implimented <br/>\nthis same bell theory with our son.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think leashes are more for parents&#39; convenience than anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle - who sometimes is around, but is always round :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!
