Maybe I&#39;ll go back and re-read the description on the<br/>\nwebsite.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI love nagging questions - for me they are always an area of personal growth<br/>\nwaiting to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is astonishing to me that anyone would want to include coercion as one of<br/>\nthe tools for getting children to learn specific things, or more accurately<br/>\n*appear* to learn things by completing a certain amount of schoolwork. Yet<br/>\nit happens all the time in schooling situations. I would consider it as the<br/>\nopposite of unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr are you meaning coercion relative to other behavior/areas of life than<br/>\nthe &quot;educational component&quot; of unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nCoercion comes from an absence of trust. If a person feels like they have to<br/>\nuse coercion to achieve some goals about their child&#39;s behavior or activity,<br/>\nand say so here, they are likely to be invited to rethink those goals, the<br/>\nassumptions behind the goals, as well as offered alternative strategies that<br/>\nare more in keeping with one of the most fundamental principles of<br/>\nUnschooling - trusting in our children and promoting their trust in us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now some musings:<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople seem to come to &quot;whole life&quot; Unschooling from two directions. Many<br/>\nwill say in their introductions that Unschooling seemed a natural<br/>\nprogression from attachment parenting and the gamut of gentle child rearing<br/>\npractices. That is how we came to it. We already had complete freedom around<br/>\nfood (I didn&#39;t make candy available to my infant btw, but she sure liked<br/>\napple sauce), encouraged computer use, had no bedtime (she just went with<br/>\nus), allowed potty learning to just happen, and had made an inviolable<br/>\ncommitment to not spanking or punishing - including imposed &quot;consequences&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nHonesty compels me to admit that TV freedom I wondered about having read<br/>\nsome of those goofy studies done about brain development. It was causing me<br/>\na crisis of integrity because I love the television - not every show on it -<br/>\nand wanted to be free to watch it. It is very ironic that Jayn is the one<br/>\nwanting it turned off, and I get to watch way less as she gets older!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was very happy to find Unschooling, having already concluded that we would<br/>\nbe really, really, really relaxed homeschoolers. It meant that we could live<br/>\nJayn&#39;s education process in the same way as the rest of our life -<br/>\nseamlessly. For me and dh the non-coercion came first, and the journey has<br/>\nbeen about recognizing/stopping if we use manipulation, and finding better<br/>\nstrategies for problem solving - identifying and elucidating the Principles<br/>\ninstead of Rules (not that we had any - rules that is), chucking away the<br/>\nbaggage of our childhoods and educations instead of constantly opening the<br/>\nbags and getting stuff out of them to use. Generally just trying to better<br/>\ngrasp what Jayn is communicating and meet those needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther people come to Unschooling from another educational system, living a<br/>\nlife accustomed to regular household rules, and start their journey to<br/>\nfreedom with trusting children to learn whatever they like. Slowly they<br/>\nrenounce schoolish language and thinking (which is often inherently<br/>\ncoercive) and start to see their children blossom again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen it often spreads like osmosis to other areas of life, gradually as the<br/>\ncomfort level of each family is challenged. Sometimes people post the same<br/>\nkind of astounded rush of relief and release of the pressure about &quot;we have<br/>\nlet go of XXXX restrictions and we are all so much happier&quot;, as they did<br/>\nwhen they first pulled their kid out of public or private school - &quot;I only<br/>\nwish we had done it sooner&quot; is the number one sentiment expressed on line.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably no one on this kind of list wants to be thought of as using<br/>\ncoercion. They use other language from the parenting arsenal like &quot;sensible<br/>\nlimits&quot; or &quot;concern for their safety&quot; or &quot;all living together comfortably&quot;.<br/>\nIt is only by talking about people&#39;s actual practices, what they *do* and<br/>\nsay to their children in any situation that the full range of what these<br/>\nphrases really mean comes out. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne person&#39;s &quot;sensible limits&quot; means that they don&#39;t leave power tools<br/>\nunattended with a 2 year old and take time to explain that these are<br/>\ndangerous - perhaps they help them examine all the buttons with the plug out<br/>\nand show them what the plug looks like. They get them some play tools and<br/>\nsafety goggles. They let them bang a mallet on some spare wood. When they<br/>\nsee their child heading for the workshop door, they go with them or make an<br/>\nappointment to do some more banging after lunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother&#39;s means that they forbid their 2 year old to enter the workshop,<br/>\nexplaining seriously but kindly that it is dangerous in there, then grab the<br/>\nkid and make them stand in a time out corner if they have gone into the<br/>\nenticingly mysterious doorway. I have read on line mothers actually<br/>\nbelieving that their children (of various ages) spend their time outs<br/>\ncarefully contemplating the crime they committed for which they are being<br/>\npunished/given consequences. I&#39;m dubious (based on my recollections of my<br/>\nchildhood) that they are making an entirely accurate prediction of their<br/>\nkids&#39; thoughts at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the phrase &quot;all living together comfortably&quot;, and its close cousin<br/>\n&quot;they live here too&quot;, have the unspoken assumption that what is comfortable<br/>\nfor the parents is either commensurate with, or takes precedence over, what<br/>\nis comfortable for the child. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No coercion whatsoever&quot; is a marvelous goal to have, a true gift to your<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
