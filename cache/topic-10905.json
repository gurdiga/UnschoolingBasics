There are some things in<br/>\nlife that aren&#39;t &quot;suggestions&quot; or requests. Even God<br/>\nrequires things of us that we may not like.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds like something you&#39;ve been told, and are repeating.<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t true.<br/>\nPeople naturally want to learn about their society and culture and how<br/>\nto thrive in it. I don&#39;t place requirements on my kids, but today they<br/>\nall came with me to help build garden beds for a good friend with a<br/>\ndisability and Trevor moved their computer system to another room.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s 16 and has no requirements in his life. Yet he chooses to help<br/>\npeople with computer related stuff. Why? Maybe the myth about not<br/>\nhaving requirements leading to selfish, lazy humans is way off base.<br/>\nMaybe trusting them to do real work, real play, using real tools from<br/>\nthe time they are very young is what allows a work ethic to unfold.<br/>\nRequirements do nothing to help my child learn about self motivation.<br/>\nI love that they are willing to do things that make sense, rather than<br/>\nwaiting for me to require it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI request that God/religion not be used as a basis for debate.<br/>\nWe all have different beliefs here and if God is the only way to make<br/>\na point, maybe the point needs to be thought through more deeply or<br/>\nfrom a different angle.
