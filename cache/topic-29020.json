There are also rails that can attach to the side of the  bed <br/>\nto keep the baby on the bed.  <br/>\n <br/>\nChildren go throw a few major independent surges in their life:  at  around <br/>\n2,7, and 13.  When a child is ready to go into their own bed, they  will.  They <br/>\ndo not need to be taught/trained to sleep on their own nor  prepared to learn <br/>\nto sleep on their own.  When they are ready, they will  go.  This will be a <br/>\ndifferent age for every child.  Just like every  child learns to count or read <br/>\nor walk at a different age, each child will be  ready to sleep on their own at <br/>\na different age.  They won&#39;t need to be  coerced.  Just let nature takes its <br/>\ncourse, and enjoy the beauty and  natural feeling of co-sleeping.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, the bed that you sleep in at night can definitely be used for napping  <br/>\nduring the day.  This will allow consistence and security, which a baby  will <br/>\nthrive on.  Some babies will nurse to sleep, and then you can slip  away.  Other <br/>\nbabies will want a warm body next to them the entire  time.  If that is the <br/>\ncase, many will have the baby sleep in a  sling......Anywhere!  You can do <br/>\nthings with your 3 year old, and sling the  baby along.<br/>\n <br/>\nCongratulations on your upcoming baby!!<br/>\n <br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nCynthia <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Biggest Grammy Award surprises of all time on AOL Music.     <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://music.aol.com/grammys/pictures/never-won-a-grammy?NCID=aolcmp003000000025\">http://music.aol.com/grammys/pictures/never-won-a-grammy?NCID=aolcmp003000000025</a><br/>\n48)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":266238020,"authorName":"Shell","from":"&quot;Shell&quot; &lt;mrsdebus@...&gt;","profile":"shellininz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: co sleeping and baby","postDate":"1201424265","msgId":29090,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZuaGgyOStrNjA2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTEyNy1EQVY0QjMwNUY0RTY4NTA3OUEyRjc3NzJBQzNCMEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":29062,"nextInTopic":29135,"prevInTime":29089,"nextInTime":29091,"topicId":29020,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We are co-sleeping with our youngest (14 months).

My youngest never had a crib. <br/>\n  What we did have was a pack and play with the bassinet. (I have had<br/>\n  this for years and plan on using it again with my third. I think they<br/>\n  even make one that opens out on the bed) Sometimes he napped in that,<br/>\n  sometimes he napped in the sling with my holding him, and sometimes he<br/>\n  napped in a bed or on even on the couch. We just used pillows to<br/>\n  protect him from falling, which he never did. <br/>\n<br/>\n  When he got to crawling age, we just sort of let him nap, where he<br/>\n  lay. Depending on what was happening in the house we moved him into<br/>\n  the bedroom if we needed to. We did have a toddler bed, which worked<br/>\n  great for napping baby because it is very close to the floor. He<br/>\n  could just get up when he wanted to. I know someone who lay a futon<br/>\n  on the floor in baby&#39;s room and she still sleeps on it at age 5. I<br/>\n  might take this idea this time around.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It will really depend on your situation and what your comfortable with<br/>\n  in regards to safety and the dynamics in your household. This time<br/>\n  around we have a small jumpy dog so we will most likely be using the<br/>\n  pack and play more for daytime-naps while the baby is little then we<br/>\n  have in the past. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;wisdomalways5&quot;<br/>\n  &lt;wisdom1133@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I have a question for all the co-sleepers out there.

The 7 month old is scooting himself around now and just started trying to pull himself up to standing so I&#39;ll need to change that. With my 4 year old we had the mattress and boxspring on the floor so, if he did scoot himself off, he didn&#39;t have far to fall and wouldn&#39;t get hurt. That never happened, though.

We just used pillows to<br/>\nprotect him from falling, which he never did.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he got to crawling age, we just sort of let him nap, where he<br/>\nlay.  Depending on what was happening in the house we moved him into<br/>\nthe bedroom if we needed to.  We did have a toddler bed, which worked<br/>\ngreat for napping baby because it is very close to the floor.  He<br/>\ncould just get up when he wanted to.  I know someone who lay a futon<br/>\non the floor in baby&#39;s room and she still sleeps on it at age 5.  I<br/>\nmight take this idea this time around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will really depend on your situation and what your comfortable with<br/>\nin regards to safety and the dynamics in your household.  This time<br/>\naround we have a small jumpy dog so we will most likely be using the<br/>\npack and play more for daytime-naps while the baby is little then we<br/>\nhave in the past.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wisdomalways5&quot;<br/>\n&lt;wisdom1133@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a question for all the co-sleepers out there.

So I knew they would need to transition to a bed at<br/>\nsome point.  So they slept with us at night, and with me during the day if I<br/>\nnapped when they did, (my boys are 23 months apart so it worked brilliantly<br/>\nwith just one kid, harder to be able to nap with the second child when the<br/>\noldest wouldn&#39;t nap) or if I wasn&#39;t going to nap then they went into the<br/>\ncrib.  What this did was make the crib not be a bad place, and I had to have<br/>\na safe place to put the baby when I had to be available for the 2 yr old.<br/>\nIt worked for us and when the boys were ready for a bed (meaning they could<br/>\nand did crawl out of the crib) we put bunk beds in their room and before<br/>\nlong they migrated in there on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nhth<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":295439124,"authorName":"wisdomalways5","from":"&quot;wisdomalways5&quot; &lt;wisdom1133@...&gt;","profile":"wisdomalways5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"co sleeping and baby","postDate":"1201375116","msgId":29020,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZuZzEyYytyb25vQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":29022,"prevInTime":29019,"nextInTime":29021,"topicId":29020,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a question for all the co-sleepers out there.
