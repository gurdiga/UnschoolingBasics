In addition, I never hear people doing it  <br/>\n&quot;correctly&quot;,  they are using an angry tone of voice when they are saying  1.  I also <br/>\nnever seeing people follow-thru with their intended consequence  at three or <br/>\nthey throw a nice adult temper tantrum.  None of these is what  is recommended <br/>\nby the author.<br/>\n <br/>\nI did accidentally find some useful tidbits from practicing 1,2,3 as I  <br/>\nbecame a less coercive parent.  My first child has some language issues and  is <br/>\nprobably on the autistic spectrum, ADHD, blah, blah, blah......basically we  had <br/>\na large gap between his actual behavior and where we needed him for safety  <br/>\nand sanity.  And a tough time helping him make those connections.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe 1,2,3 was simple for him to hear and gave him an easy understanding  that <br/>\nhe needed to stop what he was doing.  It was a good transition  tool where <br/>\nother things had failed me.  It was useful after I had another  baby and <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t always physically go and stop him from running in the street  or throwing <br/>\nsand at a kid.  I could also just show him a finger, so that he  could privately <br/>\nunderstand that he needed to change his behavior.  I never  used it in anger, <br/>\nit just replaced me nicely saying &quot;Billy doesn&#39;t want you to  throw sand on <br/>\nhim&quot;, which was really hard for him to truly understand,  especially in the <br/>\nheat of the moment.<br/>\n <br/>\nI no longer use it, and if I started fresh I probably wouldn&#39;t have. It  just <br/>\nhappened to be useful tool in the evolution of my current parenting  style.  <br/>\nSomeone could probably get to the same place we were without the  1,2, 3.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I would recommend it to someone.  Perhaps it is a good  place <br/>\nto go for people who need a middle step between spanking and yelling and  <br/>\ngentle parenting.  Frankly, for most people in my current neighborhood, it  would <br/>\nbe a huge improvement.  But none of these parents will probably ever  be <br/>\ninterested in anything beyond coercion.    For someone wanting  to move beyond <br/>\nthat, I&#39;m not sure it would be helpful as it still reinforces the  control aspect <br/>\nof parenting.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":58204288,"authorName":"mooosey3","from":"&quot;mooosey3&quot; &lt;hongslo@...&gt;","profile":"mooosey3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Member advice","postDate":"1153240776","msgId":15834,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5ajJzOCtmOGprQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU5aW8wdCtuNTdiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15829,"nextInTopic":15841,"prevInTime":15833,"nextInTime":15835,"topicId":15829,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I recently stumbled on a ... and ... can ... 1,2,3, Magic   Yuck.
