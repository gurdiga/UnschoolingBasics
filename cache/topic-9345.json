I have one view of how to unschool my son<br/>\nand my husband has another. So, we&#39;re hoping that some<br/>\nbooks can help us better understand how to go about it<br/>\nall and work together.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow is the list I usually send to folks questioning unschooling in SC <br/>\n(with a few additions). Long book list as well as elists, websites, and <br/>\nconferences.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several good books on the inanity and insanity of schools and <br/>\non<br/>\nthe marvels of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer <br/>\nin the<br/>\n70&#39;s who came to realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most <br/>\npopular<br/>\nbooks are _How Children Fail_, _How Children Learn_, _Teach Your Own_, <br/>\nand _Learning<br/>\nAll the Time_.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year. He <br/>\nfinally<br/>\nquit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely behind<br/>\nunschooling (although a little anti-TV and -gaming). His two big books <br/>\nare _Dumbing Us Down_ and _The Underground<br/>\nHistory of American Education_.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank Smith has a great little book called _The Book of Learning and<br/>\nForgetting_ that shows how little one learns in and remembers from <br/>\nschool. He<br/>\npushes REAL learning---for a purpose. GREAT for dads!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlfie Kohn&#39;s _Punished by Rewards_ shows the total inanity of EXtrinsic<br/>\nmotivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of INtrinsic<br/>\nmotivation.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrace Llewellyn&#39;s _The Teenage Liberation Handbook (How to Quit School <br/>\nand<br/>\nGet a REAL Education)_ is the &quot;bible&quot; for unschoolers. It&#39;s a great <br/>\nread for<br/>\nteens, but parents should read it too. Be SURE not to skip the &quot;cute <br/>\nlittle<br/>\nstory&quot; at the beginning. Grace also hosts the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; <br/>\nin<br/>\nthe early fall for teen unschoolers---a place to meet other unschoolers <br/>\nand share<br/>\npassions and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Griffith has two books, _The Homeschooling Handbook_ and _The <br/>\nUnschooling<br/>\nHandbook_. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for <br/>\ndocumenting<br/>\nwhat&#39;s being learned; and, since that is a requirement in SC, it&#39;s very<br/>\nhelpful. But _The Unschooling Handbook_ is THE handbook for new <br/>\nunschoolers. In it she<br/>\ngives real life examples and explanations. VERY understandable. <br/>\nConvinced my<br/>\nhusband that what I was suggesting made sense! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMark Prenky (not an unschooler) has several books---anything by him <br/>\nwould be worthwhile. But his _Don&#39;t Bother Me , Mom! I&#39;m Learning!_ is <br/>\na great introduction to understanding gaming and the 21st century.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaniel Pink---also not an unschooler---has written several books on how <br/>\ntraditional schooling/education is failing the modern human. _A Whole <br/>\nNew Mind_ is a good read.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert has two: _And the Skylark Sings with Me_ and <br/>\n_Homeschooling and the<br/>\nVoyage of Self-Discovery_. Both are witty---and easy reads.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie Fitzenreiter has a book that I highly recommend: _The<br/>\nUnprocessed Child: Living Without School_. It&#39;s about unschooling her<br/>\ndaughter, Laurie.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd&#39;s _Moving a Puddle_---a collection of essays. Most can be <br/>\nfound online and at her site, but it&#39;s nice to have them bound---all in <br/>\none place.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy absolute favorite of all time is Rue Kream&#39;s _Parenting a Free <br/>\nChild; An Unschooled Life_. It WILL change your life! Worth its weight <br/>\nin gold!<br/>\n<br/>\nMagazines:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Connections&quot; e-zine ---online magazine<br/>\n&quot;Life Learning Magazine&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Live Free Learn Free&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;, originally put out by John Holt. No longer <br/>\nin<br/>\nproduction, but back issues available from &quot;old&quot; unschoolers and from <br/>\nFUNbooks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWebsites:<br/>\n<br/>\n_www.unschooling.info_ (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info/)\">http://www.unschooling.info/)</a> There are other <br/>\nlists<br/>\nthat &quot;say&quot; they unschool; these are the radicals who KNOW what they are<br/>\ntalking about.

If you have<br/>\nquestions after reading for a few weeks, then post---but most things <br/>\nhave been<br/>\nexplained before, so if you read, you&#39;ll run across the answers to most <br/>\nof your<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n*note: this has become a rather quiet board---not that *you* can&#39;t make <br/>\nit lively again! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_UnschoolingDiscussion@...\">_UnschoolingDiscussion@...</a>_<br/>\n(mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@...\">UnschoolingDiscussion@...</a>) is a great e-list if <br/>\nyou prefer<br/>\nyour messages in mail form.

Oh well, it might be perfect for<br/>\nthe Christian families looking for change.
