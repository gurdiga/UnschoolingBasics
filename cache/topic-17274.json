Is a child building a model rocket unschooling?  <br/>\nIs a child doing problems from a textbook unschooling? Maybe the  <br/>\nmodel rocket kid would rather be playing a video game but his mom  <br/>\ngets nervous unless he&#39;s doing something that looks educational.  <br/>\nMaybe the textbook kid just loves math problems like puzzles and  <br/>\ntreats the textbook like he does sudoku puzzle books.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s more helpful to talk about unschooling in terms of values: joy,  <br/>\npursuing and valuing interests, creating a happy childhood, what  <br/>\nvaluing a child&#39;s interests looks like (something other than  <br/>\nhappiness and relief when they&#39;re doing something on their own that  <br/>\nthey might do in school!), respect them (beyond the times when  <br/>\nthey&#39;re doing what we want) and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people ask &quot;Do unschoolers use workbooks?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to reply &quot;Don&#39;t ask that question!&quot; ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the surface the simple answer is &quot;Yes, some do.&quot; But *why* is  <br/>\nsomeone asking? And what do they mean by &quot;use&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo unschoolers use coloring books?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child asks for and enjoys workbooks, is doing a workbook  <br/>\nunschooling? Depends! Depends if the mom trusts unschooling and isn&#39;t  <br/>\nbreathing a sigh of relief when the child does a workbook. Depends if  <br/>\nthe child is still deschooling and sees workbooks as essential to  <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Personally I don&#39;t label myself an unschooler or radical unschooler  <br/>\n&gt; outside<br/>\n&gt; of these &quot;groups&quot; really.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What unschoolers do in real life is live life :-) But people who send  <br/>\ntheir kids to school would say they&#39;re living life too so we need  <br/>\nsomething we can point at and define and describe to help others do  <br/>\nit. To help people do it we need more than &quot;just live life&quot;. We need  <br/>\nmore than &quot;learn what interests you&quot;.

Personally I don&#39;t define unschooling as &quot;not  going <br/>\nto school&quot;.  School is not even in my definition.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut first you say &quot;...they aren&#39;t unschooling if they choose school.   They <br/>\naren&#39;t even unschooling if they stay home and choose curriculum.&quot;   then you go <br/>\non to say &quot;*What* someone does doesn&#39;t define  unschooling. *Why* someone <br/>\nchooses something is what will define whether someone  is unschooling or not.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nThose two things doing seem to say the same thing.

Sounds a bit confusing to me.<br/>\n <br/>\nPersonally I don&#39;t label myself an unschooler or radical unschooler outside  <br/>\nof these &quot;groups&quot; really.  It helps me find more like minded individuals in  <br/>\none sense, like on lists and in homeschool groups where the focus is on  <br/>\n*education*.  But what we do is more than unschooling.  I personally  believe the <br/>\nlabel itself binds you to defining things in *school* terms.   And when you tell <br/>\nsomeone ( who is unfamiliar with homeschooling or  unschooling)  you are <br/>\nunschooling they immediately think of *anti school* (  have been told that by <br/>\nseveral people), and I don&#39;t want to be * anti school*  school is not for us right <br/>\nnow but I am not *anti* it.  I prefer to not  even think about it at all.<br/>\n <br/>\nOur (dh and I) parenting has nothing at all to do with school so I  feel that <br/>\n*radical unschooler* is even more of a mis-labeling.  We live  consensually <br/>\nand right now my children choose to live and learn and explore  etc.  But when <br/>\nI think about it if they decided to use a curriculum or text  book to learn a <br/>\nparticular topic I would not stop them, also I would not  consider us NOT <br/>\nunschooling, some may though.  I prefer to just live our  lives moving through the <br/>\ndifferent phases with ease.  Not popping in and  out of a *category* called <br/>\nunschooling, depending on what we are doing that  particular day.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway this is going off topic, LOL to the question asked.  <br/>\n <br/>\nJust my thoughts,<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17284,"nextTopicId":17262}}
