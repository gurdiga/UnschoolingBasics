Feel free to share the announcement below with your Live and Learn <br/>\nConference list, or with any other groups or lists you feel might be <br/>\ninterested in this magazine!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, say hi to Cameron for me (I was on staff at NBTSC in Vermont <br/>\nlast summer)!<br/>\n<br/>\n Steve Cooperman<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scooperman@...\">scooperman@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n New Web Magazine for Unschoolers of All Ages<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are excited to announce the launch of a new bimonthly web magazine <br/>\nfor self-directed learners of all ages—grown unschoolers, teenage <br/>\nunschoolers, parents unschooling themselves while they homeschool their <br/>\nkids, and adults who follow their inner compass and never stop learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSponge Magazine is a community and lifestyle magazine for people who <br/>\nare curious about the world around them and learning all the time. It <br/>\nis the hub of an interconnected web of self-directed learners eager to <br/>\nshare experiences, resources, advice, inspiration, encouragement, and <br/>\nnew ideas to learning problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat resources currently exist for homeschoolers/unschoolers and their <br/>\nparents, but there is nothing for homeschoolers/unschoolers beyond high <br/>\nschool age. Sponge Magazine fills the void for unschooling adults, <br/>\nanyone who understands that self-directed learning is more than an <br/>\neducational practice–it&#39;s a lifestyle based on curiosity, <br/>\nself-empowerment and inner truth.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sponge Magazine will include features and columns covering a wide <br/>\nrange of topics, including:<br/>\n<br/>\n    *  Making the transition from childhood to adulthood as a <br/>\nself-directed learner<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  *  Dealing with the struggle between self-direction and mainstream <br/>\nvalues/lifestyle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n *  Life as a self-directed learner<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n *  Travel opportunities well-suited for self-directed learners<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  *  Mainstream news interpreted from the self-directed learner <br/>\nperspective<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n *  Profiles of famous self-directed learners<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  *  Readers sharing a new idea, lifestyle, experience, discovery or <br/>\narea of interest that gets them totally psyched<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n *  And much more<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Here are some sample article titles:<br/>\n<br/>\n “Full-Time Work: Is It Necessary?”<br/>\n“Discovering a Kinesthetic Learning Style”<br/>\n“Starting a Dotcom”<br/>\n“I&#39;m a Cook at Moosewoods”<br/>\n“Berkana Learning Journey to Mexico”<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sponge Magazine was co-founded by Peter Kowalke. A lifelong <br/>\nunschooler, Peter is a columnist for Life Learning Magazine and Home <br/>\nEducator&#39;s Family Times, and a former columnist for Home Education <br/>\nMagazine. Peter was communications director at the Clonlara School. He <br/>\nis the producer of Grown Without Schooling, a documentary about grown <br/>\nhomeschoolers, and he&#39;s a regular speaker at homeschooling conferences.<br/>\n<br/>\nSponge Magazine officially debuts in October, but we’re soft-launching <br/>\nthe publication in May with the first of three, smaller &quot;newsletter&quot; <br/>\nissues. There are many ways to get involved:<br/>\n<br/>\n  *  Sign up to receive the newsletter and magazine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  *  Be part of the discussion in our forums. Help make it the way you <br/>\nwant by contributing ideas and suggestions for what should be in the <br/>\nmagazine, share advice for how we should run the project, discuss <br/>\nissues, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n *  Volunteer. We need writers, editors, web designers, promoters, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   If you are interested in getting involved with Sponge or just want to <br/>\nreceive the first issue when it is released, visit and sign up at <br/>\nlaunch.spongemagazine.com.
