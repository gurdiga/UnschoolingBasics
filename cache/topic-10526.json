It<br/>\nwas about woodpeckers. ( Read a story, learn about woodpeckers, make a<br/>\nfeeder for them, kind of nice.)  My older two were too old to participate in<br/>\nthe program because it was geared for preschoolers.  So before we left the<br/>\nhouse I asked them to bring something to work on.<br/>\nThey will usually grab a book or a drawing journal or similar things.  This<br/>\ntime my oldest took a Star Wars character book.  It is a pretty thick book<br/>\nwith &quot;many details&quot; about characters in all of the stories, including those<br/>\nwho aren&#39;t even in the movies.<br/>\nMy boys put  serious thought into following all of the connections in<br/>\nthere.  They talk on and on about characters, political connections, and all<br/>\nsorts of things. I can&#39;t keep up with it myself.<br/>\nSo at the end of program  the &quot;teacher&quot; asked my makeup artists, comic book<br/>\nartists, authors, etc that think learning about woodpeckers would be a nice<br/>\nhobby but not really a &quot;study&quot;.<br/>\nMuch Joy,<br/>\nAngela in St. Louis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10525,"nextTopicId":10504}}
