We also have a 2 yr old that likes to disrupt reading time and just about anything! We couldn&#39;t get back into the swing of things and I hadn&#39;t really kept as good  records of what they were learning as I had previous years.  It has been an bit of an overwhelming period of time for me.  I started looking into child led learning and thought they would like this and I would like this!  I created a worksheet for me to keep track of what they were learning and what interests they have and want to explore.   I fill in daily what they do and how much time<br/>\n spent. It is amazing what they learn on a daily basis! I have to report to my school district  and have been putting together a portfolio at the end of each year.  What I am not sure about is the letter of intent that I will need to send for next year.  Are any of you required to send in a curriculum plan and number of hours per subject?  Just wondering what you all do about this.  I have been reading posts over the past few days since I found the site and enjoy reading about what others are doing!  Thanks for any advice you can give!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSusan  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231930081,"authorName":"DJ250","from":"&quot;DJ250&quot; &lt;dj250@...&gt;","profile":"wibberbie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Hello!","postDate":"1213238152","msgId":33741,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE2Mjc0NEQzOUQ3NTRBOUNBMEJFOUNDNkZGRTBCMzcwQFJvY2tldFNhdWNlMj4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGcycGVobStwZmw3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGcycGVobStwZmw3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33738,"nextInTopic":47886,"prevInTime":33740,"nextInTime":33742,"topicId":5838,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, Alisia, Welcome to unschooling!

I decided to <br/>\n  introduce myself and I&#39;ll use basically what I e-mailed to her as my <br/>\n  intro. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m a member of a few unschooling groups and boards (billyandjoanne <br/>\n  at the yahoo groups and MamaWitch at unschooling.info). <br/>\n<br/>\n  Removing our family from the school system AND choosing to unschool <br/>\n  is helping our family of five to bond, grow and heal. My husband & I <br/>\n  adopted our three beautiful children in October of 2003. They are <br/>\n  siblings and had been in foster care for 4 years at the time we met <br/>\n  them. Needless to say, they came with a lot of unhealthy baggage and <br/>\n  emotional issues, mostly the older two, and the younger one <br/>\n  mimicking her siblings. At first, we sent them to school <br/>\n  because...well, that&#39;s the way it&#39;s done....it never occured to me <br/>\n  NOT to send them to school.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  By the start of the next school year (04-05) I felt that we needed <br/>\n  to find a way to bond on a deeper, more emotional level. We were <br/>\n  done with all the &quot;getting to know you&quot; stuff about each other such <br/>\n  as, who likes which cereal and who needs a night light on. I wanted <br/>\n  more for us than that. That&#39;s when I stumbled across unschooling. I <br/>\n  knew that this was what we needed...I knew my children needed to be <br/>\n  with us more...being away from us for 30-35 hours a week did nothing <br/>\n  to help promote the feeling of unity we wanted as a family. My <br/>\n  husband backed me up 100% and we took the plunge! <br/>\n<br/>\n  Since then (it&#39;s been only 7 months so this in an ongoing healing <br/>\n  process) I&#39;ve seen communication open up, feelings being talked <br/>\n  about and issues and solutions being worked out. When we first met <br/>\n  our kids, they were in occupational/physical therapy, <br/>\n  speech/language therapy and also mental health therapy. In the last <br/>\n  2 months, we dropped each one and we feel free! Free to just <br/>\n  BE....just be a family. Trust is being built up (on all sides) <br/>\n  slowly and steadily. It&#39;s only been a short time and I&#39;m excited to <br/>\n  see what the future holds for us. Taking my children out of school <br/>\n  and then embracing unschooling has given us a way to be a real <br/>\n  family. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I always suggest to any family who adopts older children, that they <br/>\n  remove them from school the day the adoption is finalized...and <br/>\n  never look back. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks, Joanne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS Unschooling  Home schooling curriculum  Home schooling high school  <br/>\n        Home schooling information  Home schooling program  Home schooling resource  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!
