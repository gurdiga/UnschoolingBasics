Pretty much how I feel, but I am still trying to get comfortable <br/>\nwith my teens drinking. I drank like a wild fish when I was her age, and much, <br/>\nmuch more. (my parents knew some, not all, I was semi trusting of them and <br/>\nthey semi of me). She has chosen to tell me of some of her expiriences and I feel <br/>\ngrateful and lucky to have the start of a more comfortable relationship with <br/>\nher. I do feel that, especially as a result of her uptight former year AND my <br/>\nprevious more structured/lacking trust style (NOTHING like her fathers...I&#39;ve <br/>\nALWAYS been closer to unschooling, I just never knew it or trusted it), that <br/>\nshe may be testing boundaries, as was mentioned with the other member and her <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s friend. My DH is TOTALLY against it, for a few reasons. He wants, <br/>\nand this is reasonable, to know that if he purchases some special beer (and even <br/>\nthe not so special ones, lol) like he is oft to do, lol, (Road Dog, Skinny <br/>\nDip, Great White and more, lol we both are lovers of microbrews) that one, they <br/>\nwill be there when he returns from work or wherever, and two, that there won&#39;t <br/>\nbe a slue or even one drunk teenager. He is also not adjusting to unschooling <br/>\nall that well btw, but that is yet another post - can you sense the new <br/>\nchanges in the family, lol?! <br/>\n<br/>\nJames, too, is expirimenting with alcohol, but i THINK we have reached a <br/>\ndecent understanding. I feel ok so far at least..pretty much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying all, I&#39;m new, and this area is really new to me.
