The drama that we hear about from some of her school friends seems beyond ridiculous.

If she&#39;s feeling like her needs <br/>\naren&#39;t being met within her unschooling life and that school will better meet <br/>\nthem maybe you could work to find ways for the unschooling life to meet her <br/>\nneeds. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean that you shouldn&#39;t take her desire to go back to school <br/>\nseriously. But if the main reason why she wants to go to school is for <br/>\nsocialising, it is, in my memory, a poor place to be socially. The costs for <br/>\nwhat little time there is for socialising is pretty great. Much better if you <br/>\ncan find ways for her to be with people now than to brace yourself for an <br/>\ninevitable return to school. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: cathymorgan25 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cathymorgan25@...\">cathymorgan25@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, 13 May, 2011 16:28:29<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] 13DD considering school again<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, our 13 yr old daughter has been out of school for two years.
