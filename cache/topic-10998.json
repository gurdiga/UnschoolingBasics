Even literature -- find the movie, discuss it, maybe read the<br/>\nbook afterwards so he gains greater understanding of what the author<br/>\nwas doing, after already familiar with the story.  Or not, you need<br/>\nto evaluate what will work best for you two.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a list designed to help people move towards UNschooling. Not<br/>\nsugar coating lessons to get kids interested in things, not dabbling<br/>\nabout with several homeschooling methods....but UNschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are here to tell you that children will learn from playing video<br/>\ngames, daydreaming, building with legos or anything else they love to<br/>\ndo!  We are here to tell you that trusting your child is the BEST way<br/>\nto help them learn. We are here to tell you that learning happens all<br/>\nthe time, just like breathing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you aren&#39;t an unschooler, and don&#39;t plan on being one, please read<br/>\nthe list guidelines carefully and try to remember the purpose for<br/>\nwhich this list was begun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a radical unschooler. I started this list with another radical<br/>\nunschooler that runs the Live and Learn conferences. Our moderators<br/>\nare radical unschoolers and while all the folks here are not radical<br/>\nunschoolers, that&#39;s the kind of advice this list is here to dispense<br/>\nand assist folks with.
