Punish in order to guide is what they believe they must do to be good parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe essence of unschooling is helping kids learn. What makes it harder to think in terms of helping someone learn is that<br/>\n<br/>\n1) it&#39;s easiest to think of ways to get someone from where they are to where we want them to be and <br/>\n<br/>\n2) we humans don&#39;t learn well when someone&#39;s steering us in a particular direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if we want a child to learn not to hit, the most obvious ideas will focus on ways to stop that behavior. But that won&#39;t work well because the child doesn&#39;t want lessons on not hitting. They already know how not to hit. What they want is to get what they want. It&#39;s also safe to assume they don&#39;t want to hurt someone but their first priority is getting what they want. They don&#39;t know how to do both.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo by focusing on getting them what they want in safe, respectful, doable ways, you help them figure out how not to hit. They learn it as a side effect of being helped to get what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When they do something that is obviously not okay...what do you do?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*Why* did they do it? That&#39;s the beginning of it all. And the end of it all too!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could you have been more present, when could you have stepped in earlier, to help them get what they wanted so they didn&#39;t have to resort to the poor tools they have?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more you can prevent, the less frustrated they&#39;ll feel over all and the more patience they&#39;ll have.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing more present is not *the* solution, of course. It&#39;s the first step, the way to cut out as much as you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they end up in an altercation, *don&#39;t* focus on the behavior. Focus on comforting who is hurt. Focus on the need. Focus on figuring out what the issue was. (I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a scenario or two linked from Sandra&#39;s Siblings page.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSee it as they had to resort to poor tools because there wasn&#39;t someone there to help them with a better way. Don&#39;t see that as a failure on anyone&#39;s part but the circumstances that dictated the tools they chose to use to solve the problem.

Be clear about what your values are.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour values aren&#39;t something to impose on him or to make him live up to. They&#39;re yours to govern how you behave. They&#39;re what you use to decide what&#39;s acceptable in your home (and outside it too) and what you need to stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s trying to solve a problem, get a need met. If he&#39;s using tools that are hurtful, he&#39;s showing he can&#39;t yet developmentally use better tools to get what he wants. He needs someone who knows better ways. By helping him, you&#39;ll make the home more peaceful and he&#39;ll see better methods of solving the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter, as always, is being more present so he doesn&#39;t have to rely on tools that are hurtful.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter also is giving him a simple problem solving process like Sandra&#39;s 1) Use words, 2) Get an adult, 3) then you can hit. It wasn&#39;t meant as a rule but as a simple tool. The child can grasp it easily. They can grasp easily where they skipped a step.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal is to help them become more thoughtful when faced with a problem.

You&#39;re expecting the &quot;boundary&quot; to Do something. That&#39;s the trouble with setting rules (or Setting boundaries or limits). The rule or boundary doesn&#39;t &quot;work&quot; all by itself. It doesn&#39;t change people or situations. That&#39;s Why people tend to fall back on punishment, as a way to intimidate other people into compliance. When you take away the intimidation factor, the rule becomes irrelevant one way or another. So look for ways to make the &quot;boundary&quot; irrelevant from the start. That&#39;s where all the kindness and thoughtfulness and proactivity come in - they make rules irrelevant. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s getting there that takes time and effort - and in that time it&#39;s very tempting to fall back on something which will pause the action and give you a breathing space. The danger is that the pause is also time for kids to build up resentment and hurt and sometimes plot retribution. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;what are some ways to enforce that boundary?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is no spoon. Step away from the idea of boundaries and look at things from a completely different angle: needs and communication. If someone is lashing out, he&#39;s communicating something big and important. By all means offer comfort if he&#39;s just hurt someone else&#39;s feelings, but don&#39;t forget that lashing out is a way to communicate hurt, too. Apologize for not noticing the problem sooner - don&#39;t &quot;ask&quot; kids to apologize - offer help in the moment and an alternative for next time (instead of out of the way stupid, how about: Mom! so-and-so&#39;s in front of the tv). And be on the look-out so the problem doesn&#39;t repeat as often. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;would I simply move the offender to their room so they can calm down?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe - it&#39;s going to depend on each child and each situation. Moving someone to another room is one option, but sometimes its better to move the offendee instead, to offer space and/or comfort. This is definitely a good case for &quot;don&#39;t look for One Solution&quot;. Sometimes you can involve the kids directly in the problem solving - and then it&#39;s good to have them in separate rooms so they can each &quot;have their say&quot; while you go back and forth, asking questions, seeking clarification, and offering suggestions for next time. Sometimes that&#39;s too much talking and it&#39;s better to scoop one kid up in a big hug while you say something sweet and gentle to the other. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":482623530,"authorName":"Lesley Cross","from":"Lesley Cross &lt;lesleycross@...&gt;","profile":"decldc1992","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: 5 yo using hurtful words / Mom&#39;s changing view on role of parent","postDate":"1338569102","msgId":48575,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVGNjgyQTRDLTM1MEMtNEQ4Ni1CMTlCLTUxMTU0MURDRDVCQ0BhdHQubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDRjBFMjk3MTRGMzMxQy1GNjAtOURGOEB3ZWJtYWlsLW0xNTUuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGpxYWxicysxMHMzcUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDhDRjBFMjk3MTRGMzMxQy1GNjAtOURGOEB3ZWJtYWlsLW0xNTUuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":48574,"nextInTopic":48576,"prevInTime":48574,"nextInTime":48576,"topicId":48550,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It requires stopping.

Do we want to be reactive parents, or responsive parents?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny because I know a business coach who talks about how some people run their businesses with the acronym of CRAP.  The (C) cycle of (R) reaction (A) and (P) panic.  I think it applies to parents too.  The child exhibits a behavior, the adult reacts in a knee-jerk fashion and then panics about what all this means about their child, his future, their parenting.   It&#39;s CRAP.  And it&#39;s not that I&#39;m saying that it&#39;s a crappy way to parent (even though it is), it&#39;s like living in crap.  Dumping crap all over yourself and your kids.  It just feels awful for everyone....parents and kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nResponsive parenting just feels better.

What does the child learn from it? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience (as the child in question), I learned that I hated my brother for getting me into this mess and that I hated my parent(s) for the punishment doled out. It really didn&#39;t stop the behavior: it just made me resentful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they do something that is not OK, I work to find the reason BEHIND the behavior. Address THAT. And then I work to avoid/prevent that in the future. That could include making sure everyone&#39;s fed, rested, unattached before going out. It could mean making sure I&#39;m spending more time with the offender. OR the offended (or both). It could mean putting off that one thing I have planned in favor of something that would benefit ALL of us. It could mean buying another tv/gaming system/doll/whatever.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could mean all sorts of things. The point is to find what&#39;s BEHIND the behavior and be PROactive to stop it before it escalates instead of looking at the behavior and trying to remedy/stop it after the fact.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it also helps to apologize to both children and admit that maybe *I* wasn&#39;t available/attentive/responsible enough to keep things from escalating in the first place. They really do appreciate when I apologize and THEN work to fix things so it doesn&#39;t happen again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand feeling the need to fall back on how you were raised. But this takes a huge paradigm shift. It requires stopping. And thinking. And THEN reacting---and not reacting out of fear, but out of taking EACH person&#39;s feelings and situation into consideration and thoughtfully &quot;walking&quot; back to where the fallout *began* and THEN very possibly apologizing and trying to make sue it won&#39;t happen again.

I was referring to allowing the consequences in situations where the child is *choosing* the consequence, ie. the natural consequence to an action is accepted by and not harmful to the child.   Say if a child doesn&#39;t normally like to be wet and chooses to play in a water spray even if there aren&#39;t dry clothes to change into available.  Plenty of options to be explored there, but ultimately the child might choose the discomfort of being wet later in favor of the joy of playing now.  In this instance, I also wouldn&#39;t play the &quot;well, you chose it!&quot; card if the child is uncomfortable later, but do the best I could to help find solutions.  Might mention it if a similar decision were being made at another time.....or I might just learn to carry extra clothes.  Then again, we don&#39;t ALWAYS know where we might find a water spray, and it won&#39;t make a difference for those moments of discomfort between having fun getting wet and becoming comfortably dry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLesley <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.euphorialifedesignstudio.com\">http://www.euphorialifedesignstudio.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] 5 yo using hurtful words / Mom&#39;s changing view on role of parent","postDate":"1338484649","msgId":48559,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyNTlFMjFCLUM3RTctNEIwNy1BN0E2LTk3MDZEMTczNDRDNEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpxODRlays2c2ExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpxODRlays2c2ExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48558,"nextInTopic":48560,"prevInTime":48558,"nextInTime":48560,"topicId":48550,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s usually when he feels he&#39;s been wronged in some way or is frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When you react to his reaction with lessons, you&#39;re essentially saying &quot;I don&#39;t care about your needs. I care about my agenda to fix your behavior.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo give him feedback that some reactions are a No. But don&#39;t assume that because he keeps using them that he doesn&#39;t know. At this point he does. At this point he may be deliberately using them *because* they&#39;re hurtful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIT&#39;s not because he&#39;s bad and so needs punished to be good. It&#39;s because he feels like the world doesn&#39;t care about him. Think about what it would take to make you lash out at people in anger.  Think about how you&#39;d react if someone got mad at your lashing out. People who&#39;ve been treated like their needs aren&#39;t important will feel even more like their needs aren&#39;t important. But for others it will tend to make them more angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he calls someone a name, do make it clear he&#39;s stepped across the boundary of what you want in your home. If you want a peaceful home, you need to be the keeper of what is okay and what is not okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately you can&#39;t control what he does. But you can make clear what your standards of behavior are for your home. if you see the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then move immediately to meeting his needs. His outbursts are coming from needs he has that he can&#39;t figure out how to meet. He&#39;s frustrated. Don&#39;t frustrate him further by imposing your agenda on top of his frustration. He&#39;ll just tune you out.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even better, be more present. That&#39;s usually the first and best strategy. Notice when he&#39;s getting frustrated. Step in before he feels he needs to call people stupid in order to get a need met. Get him food before he&#39;s to the point where it&#39;s irritating him enough to notice he&#39;s hungry, which will make him snappish. Step in if his sister&#39;s getting on his nerves. Take her off to do something. Redirect the two of them to something new.

She gave them the simple 3 step process when they had a problem.<br/>\n1) Use words<br/>\n2) Get an adult to help<br/>\n3) If that doesn&#39;t work, then you can hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For example, I have told him that we will soon be getting a pet snake.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> &quot;Soon&quot; doesn&#39;t mean the same to kids as it does to adults. It doesn&#39;t even mean the same to an adult with needs as it does to the adult who has added the need to his To Do list to take care of when he gets a chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis anger comes from frustration at being so powerless in the world. And frustration at the one he trusts to be his power in the world waving him off with vague words.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmpower him. Share with him what&#39;s needed before you&#39;ll be able to get the snake. If it&#39;s money, and you&#39;re waiting for a paycheck, share that with him. Mark it on the calendar. If it&#39;s time, share that with him. But be generous. Recognzie that he has no power to arrange the schedule. Shift around things on your schedule where you can. This isn&#39;t just generous but shows him how the &quot;Plunge in and take charge of what you can control&quot; tool looks like in action.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86487535,"authorName":"Renee Cooper","from":"Renee Cooper &lt;rmilller@...&gt;","profile":"reneem29","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: 5 yo using hurtful words / Mom&#39;s changing view on role of parent","postDate":"1338484598","msgId":48560,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTE0Ny1kczEzODdEMzU0QTU0NjU0QjY2QkRGRERDODBCMEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc3MTRDODg3LTBBRUUtNDRDMi1CNEQ3LTEyRkY3RkNCNjc4RkBhdHQubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGpxODRlays2c2ExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NzcxNEM4ODctMEFFRS00NEMyLUI0RDctMTJGRjdGQ0I2NzhGQGF0dC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":48559,"nextInTopic":48561,"prevInTime":48559,"nextInTime":48561,"topicId":48550,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"// They don t.

Letting our children know<br/>\nabout potential natural consequences and helping them make their own choices<br/>\nin regard to those potential consequences, yes. //<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce, when I was first learning about homeschooling, I read something on<br/>\nSandra Dodd&#39;s that resonated strongly with me and has stuck in my head ever<br/>\nsince.  And I don&#39;t have her gift for words so I&#39;m probably saying this much<br/>\nless elegantly:  even if you let your child know about potential natural<br/>\nconsequences and help them make their own choices, it&#39;s still unkind to let<br/>\nit happen if you see it and don&#39;t do anything to avoid it.  And being kind<br/>\nto our kids is crucial.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAha - found the page on her site:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/howto\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/howto</a><br/>\n<br/>\n//<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Think about what is REALLY important and keep that always in the<br/>\nforefront of your interactions with your children. What values do you hope<br/>\nto pass on to them? You can&#39;t &quot;pass on&quot; something you don&#39;t exemplify<br/>\nyourself. Treat them the way you want them to treat others. Do you want<br/>\nrespect? Be respectful. Do you want responsibility from them? Be<br/>\nresponsible. Think of how you look to them, from their perspective. Do you<br/>\norder them around? Is that respectful? Do you say, &quot;I&#39;ll be just a minute&quot;<br/>\nand then take 20 more minutes talking to a friend while the children wait?<br/>\nIs that responsible? Focus more on your own behavior than on theirs. It&#39;ll<br/>\npay off bigger. <br/>\n<br/>\n8. Let kids learn. Don&#39;t protect them or control them so much that they<br/>\ndon&#39;t get needed experience. But, don&#39;t use the excuse of &quot;natural<br/>\nconsequences&quot; to teach them a lesson. Instead, exemplify kindness and<br/>\nconsideration. If you see a toy left lying in the driveway, don&#39;t leave it<br/>\nthere to be run over, pick it up and set it aside because that is the kind<br/>\nand considerate thing to do and because kindness and consideration are<br/>\nvalues you want to pass on to your kids. Natural consequences will happen,<br/>\nthey are inevitable. But it isn&#39;t &quot;natural&quot; anymore if you could have<br/>\nprevented it, but chose not to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\n9. We can&#39;t always fix everything for our kids or save them from every hurt.<br/>\nIt can be a delicate balancing act-when should we intervene, when should we<br/>\nstay out of the way? Empathy goes a long long way and may often be all your<br/>\nchild needs or wants. Be available to offer more, but let your child be your<br/>\nguide. Maybe your child wants guidance, ideas, support, or intervention.<br/>\nMaybe not. Sometimes the best thing you can offer is distraction. //<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: 5 yo using hurtful words / Mom&#39;s changing view on role of parent","postDate":"1338484401","msgId":48558,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpxODhyaCtkbTd2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpxODRlays2c2ExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48557,"nextInTopic":48559,"prevInTime":48557,"nextInTime":48559,"topicId":48550,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ******************** Think about how learning works - teaching doesn t guarantee learning.

Tact is not one of the tools in his kit yet and I wouldn&#39;t expect it to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nNever announce a plan until you are ready to actually do it. Otherwise, to him, it&#39;s a lie. You said and then you took it back! How frustrating! Some day he will be able to plan ahead but he&#39;s not there yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle sister shouldn&#39;t stand in front of the TV. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might see if he will understand efficiency. That it is more efficient -- uses less of HIS time -- to gently ask his sister to move over (even though, you know, she&#39;s young and he might have to repeat himself and someday she will be a big kid like him and know better but now we have to remind her) instead of yelling at her. Because sometimes the mean yelling leads to a fight or makes the sister not want to cooperate and then it just takes longer to get her to move. He&#39;s the big kid, he is wasting his time by getting her upset (if he is), it&#39;s faster just to remind her nicely and see if she will move. Eventually she will learn. Be on his side. Help him figure out how to fix this in the best way for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I saw you title about hurtful words, I expected a lot worse than this, though. Kids are not always genteel. Especially as they are figuring out what works and what doesn&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great day! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;messy_boys&quot; &lt;messy_boys@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for all the suggestions on housework!

Can you come up with something silly he can use to replace those words and expressions? Children&#39;s shows and cartoons are often a good source of alternatives. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be a tricky thing, to learn how to express frustration and anger in ways which feel safe to other people. On the one hand, you don&#39;t want to pressure him to stuff down his feelings - but you don&#39;t want other people to get their feelings hurt, either. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;if his little sister (2 yo) is standing in front of the TV and he yells something like, &quot;move you idiot!&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s her reaction? If he&#39;s not bothered by it, then it will help if you can keep from making a bigger deal out of the matter. If her feelings are hurt, focus on that in the moment, moving her gently out of the way at the same time, and gently suggest something else he could say. If it&#39;s a Regular thing, make a note of that so you can help prevent it next time! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I told him we have to wait until I get paid again in a couple days, but he still thought we were going today.
