So on <br/>\nKenzie&#39;s birthday a couple weeks ago, she received their greatest <br/>\nhits CD as a gift and was thrilled. They listen to a wide variety of <br/>\nmusic because they&#39;ve been exposed to an eclectic mix. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOnline games - they talk to other girls on Barbie.com and play <br/>\nfashion games where they dress up characters. They play regular <br/>\nonline games and also on NeoPets.com, Cartoon Network, Disney, and <br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have a PS2 and they love DDR, Guitar Hero, and various other <br/>\ngames. <br/>\n<br/>\nTV Shows - They love Hannah Montana, Justice League, Foster&#39;s Home <br/>\nfor Imaginary Friends, Scooby Doo, Family Guy, Cow & Chicken for <br/>\nstarters. Kayla also loves Animal Planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe bought a couple packages of beads and the girls have been having a <br/>\nblast creating bracelets and necklaces. Next week, they want to try a <br/>\npaint-by-number kit. This afternoon we&#39;re going to the park after it <br/>\ncools off a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really appreciate your reply. It&#39;s been a huge help!

A calendar that you can refer to as a memory jogger - &quot;Oh<br/>\nyeah, last Friday we were at the zoo all day with the X family...&quot; and<br/>\nso on. Then you can go from there.<br/>\n <br/>\nreading fiction and non-fiction is reading, obviously, to start with.<br/>\nanimal books adds science/biology, possibly geography as well.<br/>\ncooking/baking requires reading (recipes), numbers (measuring,<br/>\ncalculating - if the 1/2 C measure is messy from measuring the oil, how<br/>\ndo you measure the 1/2 C flour? use 2 1/4 cups - that adds fractions and<br/>\nmultiplying), nutrition, possibly a bit of science (how come the cookies<br/>\nstay mostly flat but the muffins poof up).<br/>\nmusic includes not only music but also possibly culture (Duran Duran is<br/>\n&quot;oldies&quot; nowadays yikes! what was the style back then), language (how<br/>\nwords are used, rhymes, etc)<br/>\npainting is art as well as possibly science (seeing colors, mixing<br/>\ncolors, etc) <br/>\nplaying with dolls is creative &quot;writing&quot; - that is, they are developing<br/>\nscenarios and &quot;dialogue&quot; and such<br/>\n <br/>\nvarious TV shows can be a whole lot of stuff - which shows? Spongebob<br/>\nhas lots of sea creatures, that&#39;d be marine biology, for example.<br/>\nThere&#39;s also stuff on friendship, citizenship, etc. Dora includes<br/>\nSpanish, Blue&#39;s Clues includes ASL sometimes, etc. Games online - which<br/>\nones? computer skills for sure, possibly number and language skills as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n <br/>\nYour son has an &#39;internship&#39; in a vocation (like he&#39;d do at a vo-tech<br/>\nschool), music (learning guitar), computer/web skills, typing (gotta<br/>\nkeep sharp to keep up with IMing), and so on.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd, if the kids pick the workbooks and choose when to use them and how<br/>\nto use them, great. And when they decide they&#39;d rather do something else<br/>\nor maybe decide to use the worksheets as coloring pages instead of<br/>\nactually counting or adding or whatever, that&#39;s great too.
