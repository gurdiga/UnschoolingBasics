I&#39;m Deb, wife to Jeff and mom to Sarah (8.5) and Ethan (4). <br/>\nWe&#39;re new to the group and I wanted to say &quot;hi&quot; before I start<br/>\nlurking.  :) Neither of our children has been to school, though we&#39;ve<br/>\ntried a variety of approaches for learning at home.  We&#39;ve been trying<br/>\nto unschool, off an on, for a while now.  Kids love it.  Dad&#39;s okay<br/>\nwith it.  I&#39;m scared to really commit to it.  I&#39;m hoping this group<br/>\nwill be a support to help me really understand how the unschool in the<br/>\nbest way for our family.  Parenting issues/positive<br/>\nparenting/discipline seem to be interwoven with the unschooling issue,<br/>\nat least for us.  Sarah, at 8.5yo, is very social, intelligent,<br/>\nstrong-willed and opinionated, loves to read, ride her bike and lately<br/>\nshe&#39;s discovered Pokemon. She also loves to take photos, but not<br/>\nnecessarily learn about cameras or how they work.  Ethan, at 4yo., is<br/>\nnot as social but also strong-willed.  He likes to play with trucks,<br/>\ntrains, cars and in any dirt or mud he can find.  He also loves to<br/>\nread, a skill he picked up on his own when he was 3.  Drawing mazes is<br/>\nnow his passion, along with riding his new bike and playing on the<br/>\ncomputer.  I look forward to learning from all of you!  Deb in N. Texas :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19526,"nextTopicId":18759}}
