Thanks to those of you who<br/>\nlet me know I should have said that before!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs most of you know, I asked unschooling parents to let me know if<br/>\nthey would enjoy writing a chapter about their unschooling lives for a<br/>\nnew book. I now have over forty people writing chapters, with room for<br/>\nonly a few more. I&#39;m delighted and amazed at how quickly the list grew.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have another request. I am looking for more writers, but this time I<br/>\nwant children who are being unschooled or young adults who were<br/>\nunschooled, to each write a chapter for another book. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, Laurie, will be writing the introduction for this book.<br/>\nLaurie now has a column in Connections!, so you can see her writing<br/>\nstyle and sense of humor. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking for chapters from your children about being unschooled.<br/>\nThey can discuss their passion or passions, their love of being home,<br/>\nhow they like to spend their days, or anything else that they wish to<br/>\nwrite about.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your child is very young and/or has no interest in typing, but<br/>\nwants to say something about unschooling, please type it for them. Let<br/>\ntheir voices be heard. Even if they only have a single statement to<br/>\nmake, I&#39;ll put it in the book as a quote by them. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they are dealing with negative issues about unschooling and they<br/>\nwish to write about it, then I might decide to share their writing<br/>\nwith older unschoolers who would like to give them advice and/or<br/>\nencouragement, or simply respond with how they handled the same issue.<br/>\nThe response would be printed with the original chapter. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe deadline for submissions is September 30th. Have your child write<br/>\nto me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:valfitz@...\">valfitz@...</a> to let me know they want to be on the list<br/>\nof chapter writers. If you have questions, feel free to send me email. <br/>\n<br/>\nAuthors of both books will receive a free copy of the book, with an<br/>\noption to buy more copies at a 50% discount, if they&#39;re ordered and<br/>\npaid for in advance. That way I can ship them all out at the same<br/>\ntime, on the day they arrive from the printer. There&#39;s something<br/>\nmagical about holding a book you&#39;ve participated in creating, and I<br/>\nwant all of you to experience that as soon as possible. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep on writing! <br/>\n<br/>\nLove, Valerie<br/>\nwww.ubpub.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24160,"nextTopicId":24168}}
