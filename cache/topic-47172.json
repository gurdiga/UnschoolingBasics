But I thought your son and other similar kids may not grow up worrying about sounding ungrateful if their parents had some insight into what they may be thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, I&#39;ve experienced a glimpse of the other side of this, as a parent too.  At Christmas my son saw me working on painting little wooden people for a gift for his baby sister.  I had studied tons of pictures on etsy and thought a lot about it beforehand, then was very meticulously (with great attention to detail) painting on these little people to look like our family.  I had some that I had planned to paint for gifts for my son too, like star wars characters and superheros.  But as he watched me painting his sister&#39;s, he happened to ask, &quot;Why don&#39;t they have any arms?&quot;, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you painting noses and mouths on them?...If I had those, I would want them to have a nose and a mouth and arms and feet.....&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nFunny, I thought I was being VERY detailed and they were coming out just how I wanted them.  But I decided not to paint any for my son, and to buy him some plastic action figures instead.  He LOVED them!!  He&#39;s playing with them right now.  :)  My daughter loves her wooden people, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrowing up, my younger sister usually loved everything my mom made, and agreed that it was better than the original.  My mom did add her own details, like for example, sewing little bells into the hem of a dress.  What a fun idea!!...As long as you have a girl who wants to jingle!  (My sister did---I did not.)  So, once  again it all comes back to knowing your individual child.  Your boy will love you for it!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaryann<br/>\nds 5<br/>\ndd 22mo<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Doug & Melissa Edwards &lt;boisei@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maryann,<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your insights.

Over the years, she has saved lots of money, and gotten lots of compliments, and even more compliments when she said &quot;I made it.&quot; When she was in high school, she had no money for clothes, but she would window-shop in fancy stores, go to the bargin bin of the fabric store to find deals, and go home and make the &quot;exact same thing only better&quot; and look gorgeous and stylish. She made curtains and lots of other household items, toys and many, many clothes for her four kids over the years, including play clothes, christmas dresses, easter dresses, halloween costumes, and lots of flower girl dresses, bridesmaid dresses and prom dresses for her daughters and herself and others. She is currently making an elaborate silk wedding gown for her youngest daughter, and she made incredible, hand-beaded, gorgeous wedding gowns for her older two daughters, too. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She is very talented!! But, when I was a child, and I saw something cool in a store that I would like to wear, I often did not appreciate it when my mom said she could make it for me. She made me many things, and I liked them and wore them and looked cute in them. But we think differently. The things my mom makes turn out beautifully because she is creative and skilled. But if I had a specific thing in mind, it *never* turned out the way I wanted it because she does not see things the same way I do, (and because some things are not easily copied). She would sometimes make something and say it looked &quot;just like the picture&quot; (only better), and all I could see were all the ways it DIDN&#39;T look like the picture. Usually it was missing the little things I had been most attracted to originally.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I resented that she didn&#39;t appreciate what I liked about a particular thing, no matter how much I tried to explain or draw it or show it in a photograph or in person in a store. I resented that she saw me as ungrateful and unappreciative of her efforts. I resented that she got her feelings about needing to be seen as a great creator and clever money-savor all wrapped up in my feelings about wanting to choose my own outfit. And I was frustrated by being told that my mom&#39;s ideas were better than my own. She thought I was being too picky and was unappreciative of her, and I thought she was being dismissive of my ideas and cheap and just didn&#39;t care to understand me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I learned to not expect things she made to look like the original picture. I learned to appreciate my mom&#39;s efforts. But there was a lot of frustration along the way. When my mom would make something instead of buying it for me, she meant to give love by making something she couldn&#39;t afford to buy. In her mind, she spent her precious time *making* something, rather than sleeping or cleaning or just saying &quot;no&quot;. She would be SO disappointed if I didn&#39;t LOVE it and wear it and brag about it and show it off. I learned not to tell her if it wasn&#39;t what I wanted or liked. I learned to let her make what she wanted and accept it as a gift. I learned to be glad if I at least got to choose the fabric and/or the color. And actually, over the years, she got better at figuring out how to make clothes more like I wanted them, too. My wedding dress was so beautiful, and I loved that my mom made it for me. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I understand now, that my mom is good at seeing the &quot;big picture&quot;. She has incorporated more attention to detail with time. I am more focused on details, but have learned to sometimes make or buy something that&#39;s &quot;good enough&quot; rather than perfect, in order to save money or time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I want to say here is that maybe your son wants something you can&#39;t make. Maybe he&#39;s accepting you making it because it seems to be the only way he can have costumes, but what he would LOVE is to have the helmet that looks remarkably like the one on the movie. Maybe he notices every little detailed mark and line and color and would be so excited to have that in person that it would be worth buying a nice one. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe you are putting lots of love into making him things, but what he *needs* is for you to understand and value his attention to detail. Maybe he needs you to help him *find* the most perfectly detailed helmet so that he will know that you value how important that is to him. Maybe he needs to know that his interest in details is more important to you than your need for him to think your creations are good.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And once he knows that, I bet he will be a lot more appreciative of the effort you are putting into making him things, too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And, on the flip side, once he gets to look at lots of store-bought costume items, he may start to see how many details are often left out of those, too. And he may start to appreciate more what you have tried to make. OR, he may want to buy store-bought things that are *pretty close* to the &quot;real thing&quot;, and have you add more details to them. Or learn to do small alterations himself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do think it&#39;s important to separate your feelings about *your* efforts from your sons feelings about wanting detailed costume pieces. It&#39;s not useful to him to feel guilty for not thinking your skills are great. It doesn&#39;t help him to hear that details which are very important to him are not really important in your opinion. It doesn&#39;t help him to hear that if he sees something he would like to wear he should either accept something different which his parents made or try to make it himself without skills or resources.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My parents wanted to instill in us that it was preferable to &quot;do it yourself&quot; rather than buying stuff, so that we would do it ourselves, too.

He could already do a lot but I typed for him for months. Then he needed me less and less but there were days he asked me to do it. I did it gladly .<br/>\nafter a while he was reading and typing fluently.<br/>\nNo need to let him stew or make him do it. Same with so many other things he does now. In the beginning I did it for him and then he took over. <br/>\nI said:&quot;Yes.&quot; and I did it for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you are afraid that if you child does not do it himself you would be raising a child that is lazy or expects others to do things for him.<br/>\nI have not had that experience at all. I was raised with many maids while growing up. We always had a maid for cooking, cleaning, gardening, washing and ironing clothes and putting them away. It did not hinder me at all. I could do all those things early on.<br/>\n Lots of people learn by watching others . Some learn by doing better.  People learn different. <br/>\nMy daugther is one that is more likely to want to participate and help while I am doing something for her. My son will watch me do it and then one day go and do it himself without asking for help. Two different personalities and styles of learning.<br/>\nUnschooling is about learning and knowing people learn in different ways is very important to make unschooling work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowksy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":146052230,"authorName":"Sacha Davis","from":"Sacha Davis &lt;sacha@...&gt;","profile":"sacha_pie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: try things for himself or how can I help myself?","postDate":"1313846067","msgId":47181,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyREM0QUUyLTM3QzctNDAzRS1CNDM1LTQwOTNDMEE0QkIxN0Bkcml6emxlLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGoybWZscSs4aWRzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGoybWZscSs4aWRzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47180,"nextInTopic":47182,"prevInTime":47180,"nextInTime":47182,"topicId":47172,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"thank you as well for this Meredith - I don t feel that I leave my kids out there dangling as a parenting strategy but I m sure I do this without thinking","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-531696938\">thank you as well for this Meredith - I don&#39;t feel that I leave my kids out there dangling as a parenting strategy but I&#39;m sure I do this without thinking about it, most likely because it was done to me and it&#39;s a very accepted practice.

A sport?  Something that would help him relate to how  he went from a beginner to more experienced?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, just for fun, here&#39;s a few links I&#39;ve found on DIY projects.  Maybe some of these links will be of interest to him?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.filthwizardry.com/2010/10/milk-jug-storm-trooper-helmet.html\">http://www.filthwizardry.com/2010/10/milk-jug-storm-trooper-helmet.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.studiocreations.com/howto/stormtrooper/index.html\">http://www.studiocreations.com/howto/stormtrooper/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tk560.com/stormtrooper.html\">http://www.tk560.com/stormtrooper.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-cardboard-costume-helmet/%c2%a0%c2%a0%c2%a0\">http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-cardboard-costume-helmet/%c2%a0%c2%a0%c2%a0</a> ( www.instructables.com is an amazing site for all sorts of creations!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://familyfun.go.com/halloween/halloween-kids-costumes/\">http://familyfun.go.com/halloween/halloween-kids-costumes/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this is of some help.  Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVicki<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: try things for himself or how can I help myself?","postDate":"1313753214","msgId":47173,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGoybGg5dSttbjRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGoyazJzdStmZjk3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47172,"nextInTopic":47174,"prevInTime":47172,"nextInTime":47174,"topicId":47172,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Doncha just hate that!

The things the 5-year-old and I make never look like the pictures on the Play-Doh box. Not even close. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we had to talk about having fun with the Play-Doh our own way and that it didn&#39;t have to look like the box. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut Halloween costumes. First, the kids wanted things that I couldn&#39;t possibly make. Even if they wanted to help, and sometimes they did, I would just have to say it was not something I could do. And we brainstormed to find a costume that was possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we had to learn that the thrill of having someone see the costume was not going to be so great if they had never heard of the esoteric creature we were aiming at. It had to be a recognizable thing. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe there is someone in your area, a costume shop or something, that would let him in to talk about how these things are made professionally so he could see why Mom can&#39;t make them with the Singer sewing machine? Or to show him how he could learn to do it?
