My son and I helped him with that, because it was the sort of thing we enjoy doing, and we had tools and wood scraps, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other types of projects that kids might have to do for school that *I* would find overwhelming - i.e., not have time for, or not know how to do - and I would then look for outside help, if I were expected to help my child do such a project.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis applies to projects that are not for school, too. My daughter needed some help making wings for a dragon costume, for the DragonCon convention, recently. I don&#39;t know how to sew, except by hand (and not very well, at that), and couldn&#39;t really think of any suggestions for her to make the wings come out the way she wanted them. But I was available to drive her to craft stores, and to her friends&#39; homes - and her friends were able to help her finish the wings. (She got great advice on wing-making from YouTube videos. Your daughter&#39;s school projects may be subjects that there are videos about on YouTube, too.) <br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Liz&quot; &lt;lizjane68@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There was something I read here or on the other list maybe about how to mentally/emotionally handle it when your child wants to try school.

It just is. She gets to choose. If she chooses differently than they wish, there will be real consequences. If the school wishes to speak to you, you can let them know your daughter is in school by choice. And she&#39;ll stay as long as it&#39;s meeting her needs. If not, she&#39;ll come home.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can ask her &quot;What do you want from the project?&quot; to help her decide what level of effort she wants to put into the projects. Does the project seem like fun, something she might have done on her own? Does she want praise from the teacher? From other kids? Does she want grades? Does she want to not be embarrassed? Does she want to do it as a bond with the other kids? Try to help her pin down what it is she wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she want your help? Why? Because it sounds fun to do together? Or because of one of the above reasons?<br/>\n<br/>\nBe honest about how much time you have available. But I&#39;d drop the &quot;these projects are silly&quot; and &quot;just do it because it&#39;s part of the job of going to school&quot; thoughts. That&#39;s baggage. Look at your daughter, not at the school. Your daughter doesn&#39;t need to be the victim of your baggage exploding ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they sound like fun to her, if she&#39;d love to do them with you, if you can make the time, do that. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are other goals she wants, help her get clear on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":440291924,"authorName":"Liz","from":"&quot;Liz&quot; &lt;lizjane68@...&gt;","profile":"lizmikeerinryan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"child going back to school","postDate":"1347284325","msgId":49022,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGsya3FoNStuOHJjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49024,"prevInTime":49021,"nextInTime":49023,"topicId":49022,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There was something I read here or on the other list maybe about how to mentally/emotionally handle it when your child wants to try school.
