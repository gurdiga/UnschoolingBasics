The thing is I had a few kids who felt that they were missing out on certain knowledge and wanted more. So I decided to listen to their request (the eldest, the younger ones are still mostly unschooled).<br/>\n<br/>\nBy reading messages on this group and after seing the film &quot;Yes Man&quot;, I decided to stop fighting with the computer (the kids love it) and to say YES more often. We bought 2 extra computers (which makes 8 computers in the house - with 7 kids it was important). I got all the educational cd&#39;s and games out and got a year enrollment to a school supplement on internet - Maxicours (French). Now they get up and ask me to put on the computer as soon as 7 in the morning, the answer is always YES.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve put away the books. I do ask them once in a while to write an essay (or to their grandparents...).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I&#39;m not a radical unschooler, but I do offer lot&#39;s of life experiences to our kids (in and outside the house).  I do appreciate this site and thank you all for your ideas and input. I&#39;ll keep on reading (even if I don&#39;t write very often).<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you again.<br/>\nGisèle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43990,"nextTopicId":44007}}
