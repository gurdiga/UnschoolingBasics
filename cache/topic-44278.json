Probably the biggest cause is  <br/>\n&gt; expectations not matching reality. And lack of control over the reality.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The best way to avoid frustration is to match expectations to what  <br/>\n&gt; something can deliver... <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Accept what isn&#39;t in your power to control. A high needs child is a  <br/>\n&gt; high needs child. Unschooling won&#39;t change that. But unschooling can  <br/>\n&gt; remove added stress caused by school and conventional parenting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This was and still is a biggie for us at times.  I find emptying myself of expectations, (unrealistic, arbitrary ones anyhow) helps tremendously.  Realizing I don&#39;t *know* best or even what the outcome will be is okay.  Letting go and embracing trust has lessened frustrations here greatly.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Take control of what is in your power to control. Be proactive in  <br/>\n&gt; solving problems. Bring problems here :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like the way you worded this, Joyce...&quot;take control of what is in your power to control&quot;  It really hit home for me today.  It&#39;s okay to struggle, be proactive in solving problems and bringing problems to the boards is helpful!

One of the issues that comes up regularly is parents diving into unschooling with both feet and then wondering where the pack of wild hooligans came from ;) If you&#39;re new to unschooling, ease in. Say yes more, question your reasoning more, look for alternatives more, but don&#39;t try to do it all at once - it stands the chance of frustrating you *and* your kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother big frustration I see people run into headlong is &quot;common wisdom&quot;. There&#39;s a whoooooole lot of common parenting adages and truisms that are only &quot;true&quot; in the context of kids being made to do things they don&#39;t like on an almost daily basis. Unschooling happens within a different context, so conventional wisdom about parenting doesn&#39;t apply. The frustration comes from knowing that on an intellectual level but not really &quot;buying it&quot; yet. That kind of frustration may very well be part of your learning process!
