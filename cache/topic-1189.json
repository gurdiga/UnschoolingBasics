This was great.  :)<br/>\nSounds a lot like my house-though bedtimes aren&#39;t an issue for us.  <br/>\nThe girls fall asleep on their own fairly early in the evening from <br/>\nexhaustion.  lol!  I am very thankful for this!<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my youngins, well lets just say that anything can make it into <br/>\nthe house.  From frogs to rocks to..........  We have a frog in the <br/>\nfrontroom right now.  lol!  DH and ds are mowing lawn, so the girls <br/>\nhave to be inside.  6yr old dd had a frog when they told her it was <br/>\ntime to come inside and the frog followed.  lol!  Poor thing will be <br/>\nlucky to escape alive.  He is supposed to be going to live in the <br/>\ngarden.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSeems we always have a learning mess here.  I have gotten used to it <br/>\nnow, but it was a hard transition.  The biggest thing that helped me <br/>\nwas getting organized.  Having everything (my stuff) in its proper <br/>\nplace.  We also went to the extent of organizing toys into groups and <br/>\nboxes to help with clutter.  The girls can pull out a large tub of <br/>\nlegos to play, or a large tub of puzzles to play, or block...well you <br/>\nthe picture.  We are trying to gently teach about putting away things <br/>\nwhen you are done, so you have room for the next project.  It works <br/>\nsome days and not others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just love watching my kids learn and play.  There is just nothing <br/>\nbetter and I feel sorry for all the families that miss this by <br/>\nsending their children away to &quot;school&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Amanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ren Allen&quot; <br/>\n&lt;starsuncloud@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; With the talk of toddlers,messes and bedtimes, I just thought I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; share a little bit of last night and today with Jalen (3).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I got home from a four day stint of work (long days, two of them an <br/>\n&gt; hour away in Mobile) around 5pm last night.
