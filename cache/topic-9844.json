Now it&#39;s un/homeschool her or <br/>\nwatch her fail at her education completely.  I could send her off to <br/>\njob corps. but she isnt ready to leave home yet and I refuse to <br/>\nthrow my child away.

Younger <br/>\ndaughter is special needs and son is above average.  He is concerned <br/>\nthey will not get what they need at home.  I am inclined to agree <br/>\nfor now.
