So if your daughter does end up going  to school and actually LOVING it...then great. She&#39;d be LOVING her days. That&#39;s a good thing. It would be filling a need for her.

Then she&#39;d want to come home and you could continue working out ways to make her unschooling days what she needs them to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nQacei has asked to go to school at various times over the years. Each time I validated her feelings and explored her options. Only once did she end up actually going, usually it was just a passing thought. That was last Spring. She went for one week and decided it was more boring than fun or enlightening.

Almost two hours of homework in <br/>\nsecond grade.  Most of it was busy work, and she had to read(what she called &quot;baby <br/>\nbooks&quot;) for 15 min, out loud, and then put the book away.  Lil has been reading chapter <br/>\nbooks on her own for at least a year, and the teacher told her they were too hard for her, <br/>\nand sent a note home suggesting that i let lil choose her own books, which she had been.  <br/>\nAfter being cooped up in the school for 8hrs, then 2 hrs on the bus, they expected the <br/>\nkids to sit and do homework.  Sorry was a big issue for us, so glad we are done with it!!!  <br/>\nMelanie in Vt(mom to Lily 8, Grace and Emmett 5)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193844353,"authorName":"Nicole Willoughby","from":"Nicole Willoughby &lt;cncnawilloughby@...&gt;","profile":"cncnawilloughby","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Thoughts on choosing ps?","postDate":"1145224923","msgId":12149,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDE2MjIwMjAzLjMxMjA4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMxOTEzLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGUxdGU3YStwcDlpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":12091,"nextInTopic":12151,"prevInTime":12148,"nextInTime":12150,"topicId":12091,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would try to make home so interesting and fun that she wouldn t have time for school. ...
