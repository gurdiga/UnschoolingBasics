My daughter went through a period from 10ish  <br/>\n&gt;to 11ish where she watched a lot of TV and she&#39;s always unschooled  <br/>\n&gt;and always had the freedom to watch as much as she wanted. She said  <br/>\n&gt;she had writer&#39;s block. Perhaps she was filling up on stories. It  <br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t look like there was much going on. Yet now at 14 she writes a  <br/>\n&gt;tremendous amount and watches little TV.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And some other parents have said their preteens went through that  <br/>\n&gt;phase too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think part of it was not wanting to miss what might be coming on. I  <br/>\n&gt;think there were two factors. There were a lot of programs she liked  <br/>\n&gt;and she felt like she was at the mercy of the programmers who might  <br/>\n&gt;sneak a new episode in or replay one of her favorites. I think TiVo  <br/>\n&gt;would have helped by letting her capture everything she wanted to  <br/>\n&gt;watch and letting her watch it when she wanted to.

All he wants to  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; do, is play games on the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; computer all day. And the others want to watch TV all day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you want to unschool it will help not to divide the world between  <br/>\n&gt;what you want them to do/what you think is a good use of time and  <br/>\n&gt;what they want to do. It should all be what they want to do plus  <br/>\n&gt;ideas you bring in and offer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; They know what they can and cannot watch, and adhere to these  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; rules. BUT ALL DAY. So I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have limited the TV to the weekends only, and the computer to after  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; 3, unless playing an<br/>\n&gt;&gt; educational game, or research etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As said on the other thread, when things are limited they grow in  <br/>\n&gt;importance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Think about your favorite thing in the world. Then imagine that  <br/>\n&gt;someone only allows you to have it for 15 minutes a month. You could  <br/>\n&gt;have it other times. It&#39;s right there and you could pick it up but  <br/>\n&gt;you aren&#39;t allowed to. Imagine how much energy you would focus on  <br/>\n&gt;that upcoming 15 minutes you were allowed. Imagine how you would try  <br/>\n&gt;to sneak in as many minutes as you could get away with to expand the  <br/>\n&gt;15 minutes when you had it. Imagine what you would do if you were  <br/>\n&gt;alone and you knew no one would stop you from doing it even though it  <br/>\n&gt;wasn&#39;t your permitted time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rather than spending energy being a roadblock, spend energy helping  <br/>\n&gt;them explore their interests. Sit with them or bring laundry in to  <br/>\n&gt;fold while they watch their favorite programs or play on the  <br/>\n&gt;computer. Ask them what they like about them. Walk along beside them  <br/>\n&gt;as they explore rather than waiting off on the side beside something  <br/>\n&gt;you wish they were interested in. But do be interested yourself and  <br/>\n&gt;let that interest flow out to them. Show them things. They can&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt;expand their interests if new ideas aren&#39;t running through their  <br/>\n&gt;lives. But don&#39;t invest much in their interest. Your part is to be  <br/>\n&gt;interested in things and share with them, not make them learn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Any suggestions on motivating them to want to learn more,  and  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; become more self directed<br/>\n&gt;&gt; in their learning?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yes, be more interested in what they are exploring and what interests  <br/>\n&gt;them right now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; i can come up with a project idea, and they are all for it, but  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; unless I sit right there with them,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; they do not work on it very long, and they fight.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Some kids do projects independently but that&#39;s personality, not an  <br/>\n&gt;expectation. My daughter at 14 often enjoys doing crafts with me  <br/>\n&gt;because it&#39;s the togetherness part she enjoys as much as the craft.  <br/>\n&gt;And even when she&#39;s doing something on her own like drawing she likes  <br/>\n&gt;to have me drawing at the same time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; OH THE FIGHTING. Some days, I just send them to their rooms to play.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I am getting so burnt out, I need to revamp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There&#39;s something that&#39;s stressing them. Can you talk more about  <br/>\n&gt;what&#39;s going on? What are some recent scenarios?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Joyce<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 3         <br/>\n&gt;   Date: Thu, 19 Jan 2006 07:11:08 -0500<br/>\n&gt;   From: Amy Bowers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:amybarbo@...\">amybarbo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: To Amy B re: Boomwhackers was Unschooling right this minute<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well, even if your kids don&#39;t like them - then you will have a new toy!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Was it Danielle who wrote once about having a banging wall in her<br/>\n&gt;backyard?

I have always thought that watching TV all day fell in the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;same <br/>\n&gt;&gt; category as eating chocolate or ice cream all day, something that <br/>\n&gt;&gt;even <br/>\n&gt;&gt; as an unschooler I wouldn&#39;t allow - I still feel that I need to help <br/>\n&gt;&gt; my child develop healthfully. So am I totally off-base on that? Does <br/>\n&gt;&gt; anyone feel that way about TV (that it is addictive and not <br/>\n&gt;&gt; particularly healthy for anyone and should be treated as &quot;dessert&quot;?)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Just curious!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Susan<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s no bigger a part of our lives than any other thing, from books to <br/>\n&gt;music to Legos. Just as ice cream or chocolate are no more or less <br/>\n&gt;than a part of a whole balance of eating. Developing healthfully is <br/>\n&gt;learning balance of things, not separating out certain things as &quot;bad <br/>\n&gt;for you&quot; or &quot;only a little bit now and then&quot;. There are times when I <br/>\n&gt;want lots of chocolate, so I eat lots of chocolate. There are times <br/>\n&gt;when one or two individual chocolate morsels is plenty and there are <br/>\n&gt;times when I&#39;d rather have strawberries. Just so, there are times when <br/>\n&gt;I want lots of TV, times when I watch one or two favorites and that&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;all and times when I am doing other things entirely. Balance. By <br/>\n&gt;setting TV (or ice cream or cake or video games) out as something that <br/>\n&gt;has to be rationed and earned (by finishing all the peas or reading 2 <br/>\n&gt;chapters or spending an hour out in the yard), it sets those things <br/>\n&gt;apart as more desirable *because* they are rationed. (BTW have you <br/>\n&gt;ever considered the whole &#39;finish all your supper before you have <br/>\n&gt;dessert concept? Basically what it is saying is fill yourself up and <br/>\n&gt;then you can have what you want, but by that time you&#39;re full, but you <br/>\n&gt;still want the cookie so you over fill - seems like if you just ate as <br/>\n&gt;much peas and as much chicken and as much cookie as you wanted it <br/>\n&gt;would all balance without over eating). DS calls ice cream et <br/>\n&gt;al &#39;dessert&#39; since that&#39;s what it is called in the larger culture <br/>\n&gt;(check a restaurant menu for instance). However, if he chooses, he can <br/>\n&gt;have ice cream and then have a sandwich or can have both at the same <br/>\n&gt;time (except the ice cream tends to get melty if he&#39;s going back and <br/>\n&gt;forth). Manys the time that I&#39;ve brought a double chocolate donut home <br/>\n&gt;from work (when our summer interns leave, for instance, tradition is <br/>\n&gt;that they bring donuts on their last day. I&#39;ll grab one and bring it <br/>\n&gt;home for DS). When I get home from work, dinner is usually cooking if <br/>\n&gt;not ready already. I&#39;ll give him the donut. Sometimes he saves it <br/>\n&gt;until after eating whatever is for dinner. Other times he eats the <br/>\n&gt;whole thing right away. And sometimes he&#39;ll eat part then eat dinner <br/>\n&gt;then eat the rest. Since it has no greater or lesser weight than <br/>\n&gt;anything else, no emotional ties, no hint of &#39;forbidden or <br/>\n&gt;restricted&#39;, he eats it as he chooses when he chooses in response to <br/>\n&gt;what his body says at the time. Of the three of us (me, DH, and DS) DS <br/>\n&gt;is the most likely to eat one cookie and stop or leave a dish of ice <br/>\n&gt;cream half eaten because he is done eating ice cream.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Same for TV - he watches when he wants, what he wants, and when he is <br/>\n&gt;done, he moves to something else (and often he&#39;s doing something else <br/>\n&gt;in the middle of TV watching also) and vice versa - when he&#39;s done <br/>\n&gt;inthe yard or playing with Legos or whatever (when he&#39;s filled up on <br/>\n&gt;how much of it he wants) he can move to TV or video games if he <br/>\n&gt;chooses, if he has a &#39;taste&#39; for it. Of us all, he is the least likely <br/>\n&gt;to &#39;veg out&#39; in front of the TV. He&#39;ll leave the room or turn it off <br/>\n&gt;or simply ignore it (as he chooses) when he doesn&#39;t find anything he <br/>\n&gt;wants to watch, whereas DH and I will flip channels back and forth <br/>\n&gt;rather than turn it off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But, in food and TV and other things, we&#39;re learning a lot about <br/>\n&gt;balance and listening to our insides from DS and we&#39;re getting better <br/>\n&gt;about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--Deb<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 9         <br/>\n&gt;   Date: Thu, 19 Jan 2006 08:15:59 -0600<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;Mother Earth &#92;(Tyra&#92;)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:motherspirit@...\">motherspirit@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Speaking of bedtimes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I think we should start our own series &gt;called &quot;Parenting Mythbusters&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;where we explode all  the current theories &gt;about parenting.:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ren,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just wrote to another group that I belong something in this same vein.  We <br/>\n </span></blockquote>have been discussing unschooling versus other styles of learning at home.  We <br/>\nwere discussing what students need to learn to go to college.  A few of the <br/>\nother parents were saying that they teach their children what they need to learn <br/>\nto go to college because certain subjects are needed.  I told them about the <br/>\nrecent posting on this group where the mother said that she would meet with <br/>\ncollege officials and show her son&#39;s portfolio and resume, etc...  I told them <br/>\nthat what unschoolers help me to realize is that there is always out of the box <br/>\nexperiences and approaches to life.  Where everyone is taking Road A because <br/>\nthat is what we are told we are supposed to do in order to arrive at Place A, <br/>\nunschoolers have helped me to realize that there are an infinite number of roads <br/>\nthat can get me to Road A.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;So many parents think that unschooling equals less parenting, but I believe <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that once parents talk to and see unschoolers in actions, it will make them <br/>\nrealize that everything they were conditioned to believe makes a good parent is <br/>\nup for question.  This group has definitely busted parenting myths for me, <br/>\nespecially in the area of TV and candy eating.  What I know that many parents <br/>\ndon&#39;t understand is that there is so much more freedom in this way of living.

It should all be what they want to do plus  <br/>\n&gt;ideas you bring in and offer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; They know what they can and cannot watch, and adhere to these  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; rules. BUT ALL DAY. So I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have limited the TV to the weekends only, and the computer to after  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; 3, unless playing an<br/>\n&gt;&gt; educational game, or research etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As said on the other thread, when things are limited they grow in  <br/>\n&gt;importance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Think about your favorite thing in the world. Then imagine that  <br/>\n&gt;someone only allows you to have it for 15 minutes a month. You could  <br/>\n&gt;have it other times. It&#39;s right there and you could pick it up but  <br/>\n&gt;you aren&#39;t allowed to. Imagine how much energy you would focus on  <br/>\n&gt;that upcoming 15 minutes you were allowed. Imagine how you would try  <br/>\n&gt;to sneak in as many minutes as you could get away with to expand the  <br/>\n&gt;15 minutes when you had it. Imagine what you would do if you were  <br/>\n&gt;alone and you knew no one would stop you from doing it even though it  <br/>\n&gt;wasn&#39;t your permitted time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rather than spending energy being a roadblock, spend energy helping  <br/>\n&gt;them explore their interests. Sit with them or bring laundry in to  <br/>\n&gt;fold while they watch their favorite programs or play on the  <br/>\n&gt;computer. Ask them what they like about them. Walk along beside them  <br/>\n&gt;as they explore rather than waiting off on the side beside something  <br/>\n&gt;you wish they were interested in. But do be interested yourself and  <br/>\n&gt;let that interest flow out to them. Show them things. They can&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt;expand their interests if new ideas aren&#39;t running through their  <br/>\n&gt;lives. But don&#39;t invest much in their interest. Your part is to be  <br/>\n&gt;interested in things and share with them, not make them learn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Any suggestions on motivating them to want to learn more,  and  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; become more self directed<br/>\n&gt;&gt; in their learning?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yes, be more interested in what they are exploring and what interests  <br/>\n&gt;them right now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; i can come up with a project idea, and they are all for it, but  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; unless I sit right there with them,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; they do not work on it very long, and they fight.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Some kids do projects independently but that&#39;s personality, not an  <br/>\n&gt;expectation. My daughter at 14 often enjoys doing crafts with me  <br/>\n&gt;because it&#39;s the togetherness part she enjoys as much as the craft.  <br/>\n&gt;And even when she&#39;s doing something on her own like drawing she likes  <br/>\n&gt;to have me drawing at the same time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; OH THE FIGHTING.

I have always thought that watching TV all day fell in the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;same <br/>\n&gt;&gt; category as eating chocolate or ice cream all day, something that <br/>\n&gt;&gt;even <br/>\n&gt;&gt; as an unschooler I wouldn&#39;t allow - I still feel that I need to help <br/>\n&gt;&gt; my child develop healthfully. So am I totally off-base on that? Does <br/>\n&gt;&gt; anyone feel that way about TV (that it is addictive and not <br/>\n&gt;&gt; particularly healthy for anyone and should be treated as &quot;dessert&quot;?)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Just curious!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Susan<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s no bigger a part of our lives than any other thing, from books to <br/>\n&gt;music to Legos. Just as ice cream or chocolate are no more or less <br/>\n&gt;than a part of a whole balance of eating. Developing healthfully is <br/>\n&gt;learning balance of things, not separating out certain things as &quot;bad <br/>\n&gt;for you&quot; or &quot;only a little bit now and then&quot;. There are times when I <br/>\n&gt;want lots of chocolate, so I eat lots of chocolate. There are times <br/>\n&gt;when one or two individual chocolate morsels is plenty and there are <br/>\n&gt;times when I&#39;d rather have strawberries. Just so, there are times when <br/>\n&gt;I want lots of TV, times when I watch one or two favorites and that&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;all and times when I am doing other things entirely. Balance. By <br/>\n&gt;setting TV (or ice cream or cake or video games) out as something that <br/>\n&gt;has to be rationed and earned (by finishing all the peas or reading 2 <br/>\n&gt;chapters or spending an hour out in the yard), it sets those things <br/>\n&gt;apart as more desirable *because* they are rationed. (BTW have you <br/>\n&gt;ever considered the whole &#39;finish all your supper before you have <br/>\n&gt;dessert concept? Basically what it is saying is fill yourself up and <br/>\n&gt;then you can have what you want, but by that time you&#39;re full, but you <br/>\n&gt;still want the cookie so you over fill - seems like if you just ate as <br/>\n&gt;much peas and as much chicken and as much cookie as you wanted it <br/>\n&gt;would all balance without over eating). DS calls ice cream et <br/>\n&gt;al &#39;dessert&#39; since that&#39;s what it is called in the larger culture <br/>\n&gt;(check a restaurant menu for instance). However, if he chooses, he can <br/>\n&gt;have ice cream and then have a sandwich or can have both at the same <br/>\n&gt;time (except the ice cream tends to get melty if he&#39;s going back and <br/>\n&gt;forth). Manys the time that I&#39;ve brought a double chocolate donut home <br/>\n&gt;from work (when our summer interns leave, for instance, tradition is <br/>\n&gt;that they bring donuts on their last day. I&#39;ll grab one and bring it <br/>\n&gt;home for DS). When I get home from work, dinner is usually cooking if <br/>\n&gt;not ready already. I&#39;ll give him the donut. Sometimes he saves it <br/>\n&gt;until after eating whatever is for dinner. Other times he eats the <br/>\n&gt;whole thing right away. And sometimes he&#39;ll eat part then eat dinner <br/>\n&gt;then eat the rest. Since it has no greater or lesser weight than <br/>\n&gt;anything else, no emotional ties, no hint of &#39;forbidden or <br/>\n&gt;restricted&#39;, he eats it as he chooses when he chooses in response to <br/>\n&gt;what his body says at the time. Of the three of us (me, DH, and DS) DS <br/>\n&gt;is the most likely to eat one cookie and stop or leave a dish of ice <br/>\n&gt;cream half eaten because he is done eating ice cream.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Same for TV - he watches when he wants, what he wants, and when he is <br/>\n&gt;done, he moves to something else (and often he&#39;s doing something else <br/>\n&gt;in the middle of TV watching also) and vice versa - when he&#39;s done <br/>\n&gt;inthe yard or playing with Legos or whatever (when he&#39;s filled up on <br/>\n&gt;how much of it he wants) he can move to TV or video games if he <br/>\n&gt;chooses, if he has a &#39;taste&#39; for it. Of us all, he is the least likely <br/>\n&gt;to &#39;veg out&#39; in front of the TV. He&#39;ll leave the room or turn it off <br/>\n&gt;or simply ignore it (as he chooses) when he doesn&#39;t find anything he <br/>\n&gt;wants to watch, whereas DH and I will flip channels back and forth <br/>\n&gt;rather than turn it off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But, in food and TV and other things, we&#39;re learning a lot about <br/>\n&gt;balance and listening to our insides from DS and we&#39;re getting better <br/>\n&gt;about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--Deb<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 9         <br/>\n&gt;   Date: Thu, 19 Jan 2006 08:15:59 -0600<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;Mother Earth &#92;(Tyra&#92;)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:motherspirit@...\">motherspirit@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Speaking of bedtimes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I think we should start our own series &gt;called &quot;Parenting Mythbusters&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;where we explode all  the current theories &gt;about parenting.:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ren,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just wrote to another group that I belong something in this same vein.  We have been discussing unschooling versus other styles of learning at home.  We were discussing what students need to learn to go to college.  A few of the other parents were saying that they teach their children what they need to learn to go to college because certain subjects are needed.  I told them about the recent posting on this group where the mother said that she would meet with college officials and show her son&#39;s portfolio and resume, etc...  I told them that what unschoolers help me to realize is that there is always out of the box experiences and approaches to life.  Where everyone is taking Road A because that is what we are told we are supposed to do in order to arrive at Place A, unschoolers have helped me to realize that there are an infinite number of roads that can get me to Road A.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So many parents think that unschooling equals less parenting, but I believe that once parents talk to and see unschoolers in actions, it will make them realize that everything they were conditioned to believe makes a good parent is up for question.  This group has definitely busted parenting myths for me, especially in the area of TV and candy eating.  What I know that many parents don&#39;t understand is that there is so much more freedom in this way of living.  I have more time to connect with my children rather than regulate them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Much Love<br/>\n&gt;Tyra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 10        <br/>\n&gt;   Date: Thu, 19 Jan 2006 05:55:56 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n&gt;   From: patricia tidmore &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ptidmore1117@...\">ptidmore1117@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Re: bedtimes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks Kay,<br/>\n&gt;  After reading your reply I am thinking maybe we aren&#39;t comunicating enough with the boys just how much we need it to be quiet so that we can rest in the evenings.<br/>\n&gt;  We have explained our health problems,but maybe we are needing to EACH night before going to our rooms ask them could they stay in THEIR room and play quietly? <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;  Tricia<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;  nrskay &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:k_bird@...\">k_bird@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;nrskay&quot; &lt;k_bird@c...&gt; <br/>\n&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   I have fibromyalgia also, 52 yo and am totally toast by 6pm.

Now we enjoy all kinds of <br/>\n&gt;things together.  We play PS2 and neopets together and watch some TV <br/>\n&gt;together.  My biggest concern was the way she was shutting me out. Now <br/>\n&gt;she can&#39;t stand it if I&#39;m not involved with what she is doing, (she&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;my youngest and only child at home).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let your son deschool, you and your hubby need to deschool too. It is <br/>\n&gt;not easy, I really struggled with whether I was ruining her life by <br/>\n&gt;letting her do this stuff all day.  You will see the fruits of your <br/>\n&gt;relaxing when this stage is over.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kay<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!
