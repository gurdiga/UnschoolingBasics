Being in an environment where  <br/>\nthere&#39;s pressure to do what you can&#39;t yet, and messages that you&#39;re  <br/>\ndefective because you aren&#39;t doing something that &quot;everyone else&quot; is,  <br/>\nis what causes reading problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids naturally learn to read typically between 4 and 12. By 15,  <br/>\nthough, you can&#39;t tell who read earlier and who read later. A 12 year  <br/>\nold who has just decoded the code for reading isn&#39;t 6 years behind  <br/>\none who decoded the code at 6. The 12 year old quickly catches up to  <br/>\nhis or her age mates because all the other brain areas that are  <br/>\nneeded for reading were developing and being used for other things  <br/>\nand just waiting for the last piece to kick in.

Why do you fear that just  <br/>\nbecause he can&#39;t understand now, he won&#39;t understand 5 years from now?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you associate knowing nouns and verbs as being smart? You  <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to tell us. Just think about it. We&#39;re all chock full of  <br/>\ninconsistencies that clog up clear thinking!
