They <br/>\n*seem* to be doing just fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nRay is really great about &quot;keeping himself occupied&quot; when I&#39;m out. <br/>\nAt the same time, though, I&#39;m not there to offer him the last <br/>\ncookie, look at a cool new trick he can do, or chat about whatever <br/>\ncatches his interest on Runescape or Mythbusters. Those are all as <br/>\nmuch a part of supporting his autonomy (and other needs) as making <br/>\nsure he can get himself some food and find things to do on his own. <br/>\nIts true that he doesn&#39;t really *need* me to be around every second <br/>\nto do these things, but there&#39;s also no way of knowing when those <br/>\nmoments will happen.

I also had to work full time, and still do. Her Dad had back surgery that summer and during his &quot;recuperation&quot; he was directing the rehab of the house we now live in, so he was largely unavailable during the day also. It was not exactly easy &quot;deschooling&quot; and I felt bad for not being able to be around, and for her being &quot;left to her own devices.&quot; But in spite of the boredom and isolation she felt, she was in no way compelled to go back to school. Now, 16 months later, she has tons of friends, many of whom she met at Not Back To School Camp as well, and is very much occupied all the time with a variety of activities. So despite the situation, it was a good decision overall for us. <br/>\nI have had to deal with the attitudes of people and family members but basically, I have a policy of silence on the issue. I am not out to convert anyone at this stage, so with the parent&#39;s of her conventionally schooled friends I just never mention it. I let them assume whatever they want. I am suitably vague with concerned family members. I just tell them I am &quot;keeping records and complying with state standards.&quot; <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151505017,"authorName":"carenkh","from":"&quot;carenkh&quot; &lt;carenkh@...&gt;","profile":"carenkh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Working Question","postDate":"1190984402","msgId":26528,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZkaXRzaStramRlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZkaGkzciszY29mQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26526,"nextInTopic":26530,"prevInTime":26527,"nextInTime":26529,"topicId":26520,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I do get the <br/>\nsurprized looks from people who learn we homeschool and some people <br/>\nask about when we do things.  I usually skirt around it by saying she <br/>\nis old enough to be self directed and that I monitor what she does in <br/>\nthe evenings.  That&#39;s true enough but they probably see it in a <br/>\ndifferent way than what really happens.  In reality we talk during the <br/>\nday at least once & send e-mails especially if one of us finds <br/>\nsomething cool.  She just came back from Not Back to School Camp so <br/>\nnow she has friends to talk to during the day.  In the evenings we <br/>\nhang out, cook, play games, go out & talk about stuff.  I&#39;ve found <br/>\nsome really coool lecture/discussions at a local college we want to <br/>\ncheck out.  She&#39;s also teaching herself to play guitar.  We tried to <br/>\nlearn to crochet but neither one of us could figure it out from the <br/>\nbook so we need someone to show us.  On the weekends  she likes to <br/>\nspend time with her friends, do fun stuff and work (she does child <br/>\ncare at church).  My mom usually has one day off during the week and <br/>\nthey spend time together.   I know she would be happy to have me at <br/>\nhome with her more but we do make it work.  Bottom line is whatever <br/>\nyou decide to do, don&#39;t feel guilty about it.  If it doesn&#39;t work for <br/>\nyour family then do something different.  <br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Working Question","postDate":"1190913540","msgId":26521,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZkZ29tNCtzZHRsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZkZ2xrcSs3dnMwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26520,"nextInTopic":26524,"prevInTime":26520,"nextInTime":26522,"topicId":26520,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you can afford it, I would wait.

Over the years I&#39;ve cut down the <br/>\namount that I work outside the home - now its about three days a <br/>\nmonth. Being available and supportive takes a lot more time and <br/>\nenergy than is obvious on the surface, and everyone in the family <br/>\nnotices when I&#39;m gone for a day. That&#39;s something I have a hard time <br/>\ncommunicating to non-homeschoolers for the most part. I&#39;ve found <br/>\nthat I *can&#39;t* do any kind of venting about wanting to get some of <br/>\nmy own needs met to friends and family who have never homeschooled. <br/>\nI save that for the message boards and my &quot;play dates&quot; with other <br/>\nhome/unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Do family members ask when you homeschool?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t have a schedule, per se, but we do have a fairly regular <br/>\nroutine in terms of when we&#39;re more likely to be home vs out. If I <br/>\nneed to stave off nosey family or neighbors I&#39;ll refer to those <br/>\ntimes as &quot;our homeschool time&quot;.

I am curious how it works for you? Are your kids<br/>\nok with it? Do family members ask when you homeschool? Should I feel<br/>\nguilty for doing this now?
