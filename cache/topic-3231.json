But the grocery store, hospitals, and gas  <br/>\nstations have power.<br/>\n <br/>\nHer yard was trashed---littered with debris, but her house  was practically <br/>\nuntouched by wind or water. She feels very lucky. They&#39;re  all safe and happy <br/>\nto be home. <br/>\n <br/>\nPensacola Beach, where the hotel is, is unaccessible; mandatory evacuation  <br/>\nand the bridges are out, so no one can get on to check it out.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;re not yet ruling out P&#39;cola for next year&#39;s conference. The hotels  *say* <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be up and running by the spring. We&#39;ll wait to make decisions  until <br/>\nwe hear what the real scoop is---maybe another month or so.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you want to send her cards or letters, e-mail me privately. I&#39;ll be  happy <br/>\nto give you her address or phone number.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe says she misses everyone---and thanks for all the good wishes.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":72521049,"authorName":"Wendy E","from":"&quot;Wendy E&quot; &lt;mommytoluc@...&gt;","profile":"mommytoluc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Does anyone know how Ren is?","postDate":"1095550789","msgId":3231,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNpaWgwNSs4bGlxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3237,"prevInTime":3230,"nextInTime":3232,"topicId":3231,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just wondering how she and anyone else down that way fared with Ivan.
