When I talk about re=homing it is not to make it easier for you ( that may also happen) but to give that animal what he/she deserves.<br/>\n  The dog I re-homed was a show dog that loved being primped up and it was unfir to have him all by himself for hours alone in an apartment while I was busy in Law School. He went to live with Schnauzer breeders that I co-owned animals with. He was surrounded by other schnauzers including his offsprings. He was primped several times a week ( he just loved being in the table and getting brushed). I did not do it for me, I did it for him. <br/>\n  On the other hand I had a german shepard I got right after I graduated that went with me everywhere. I moved form Brazil here with her. I had to pay more to have her in apartments.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have been working with dogs for 30 years and I always tell people that when they get a dog it becomes part of the family and it is a life time commitment. I also tell people to first look into adopting instead of buying dogs for many reasons.<br/>\n  To give those animals a chance, to know what they are getting into ( shelters may know the animal&#39;s personality) .<br/>\n  I also ask that they research the breed to see if it can be a good fit to your family.<br/>\n  My dogs have always been like my kids and been part of the family but If I needed to re-home a dog I would do it . I would make sure the home was a perfect fit for that animal because they deserve better. <br/>\n  I see so many people that get dogs and have no clue what they are getting into and the animal is the one who suffers.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  But having said all that I loved what Deb wrote. That was an inspiring post and you should read it many times to yourself.<br/>\n  Heck I am going to print and read when I get crabby because the house is a mess.......<br/>\n  If you decide it is better for them to be re-homed please make sure your dd is OK with that.

Fill up the sink with hot soapy water and every time you walk past, wash one thing and put it away.  Make a cake and call a friend to come help you with housework and then next week make a cake and go help her.   Start with one corner of one room.  Don&#39;t think about everything you have to do, pick one thing and do that and then pick another thing.   Why didn&#39;t you ask your sis for help?  Maybe she&#39;s not the helping kind.  : (<br/>\n<br/>\nLike unschooling and pet care, housework is not one thing you do one time.  It&#39;s ongoing and it will take some part of your time every day.  I think we sometimes feel like life should be a series of steps in one direction that take us somewhere.   It&#39;s not.  It&#39;s little choices we make every day, every day, every day, to do the things that sustain us.  It&#39;s not different somewhere else.  People with clean houses have clean houses because they clean them, or hire them cleaned.  People who don&#39;t care so much about clean houses  have livable houses because they give some part of their time to maintaining some level of &quot;livable.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are not willing to maintain some level of livable then maybe school would be better for your kid.  If she&#39;s home with you but home is unpleasant because it&#39;s a mess or because mom is staring at a wall or because there&#39;s no money to go or do anything then school would be better.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re depressed, address that but you can, at the same time, take action to improve your life at home.  You can be depressed in a clean house too.  You can be depressed while you do dishes or mop the floor or walk the dog.  *Or*, you can choose not to dedicate yourself to your downward spiral and start grabbing for the things that can pull you up.  Something well done is inspiring and feeds a desire to move toward a more positive frame of mind.  Even if that thing is a load of laundry, a clean kitchen counter, a big pot of soup.  Depression can be seductive, but you&#39;re not powerless. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre you stuck thinking that if you could just find some time to be creative and do your art you&#39;d find the positive attitude you think you need to get more fully into life?   You can find that positive attitude in taking care of your house and kid.   There is a kind of art and creativity in caring for your home and family.   Stop looking for answers everywhere else and *get busy.*  Do something.  Really.  Get moving, get your blood pumping. Whirl into your housework and whirl into your life.   Light candles, put on some music, open a bag of M&M&#39;s (put them where the puppy can&#39;t reach if you want to have some for yourself) so you can grab a handful when you&#39;re zooming around picking up the house.   When you&#39;re muscles are working and your life is benefiting you will feel more creative and have more energy to do the creative things that help fulfill you.   But don&#39;t get trapped into thinking that fulfillment can only come if you can escape from your home or kid or life&#39;s responsibilities.  That&#39;s just not true.  You have the power and capability to do both, be a creative person and be a person living happily and comfortably in the life she&#39;s making.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***Add to that, we are very much in debt and going deeper every month<br/>\nwhich makes going back to work very appealing.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat changes could you make to start living now within your means? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were in a crunch we cut out satellite TV and asked our friends to record some of our favorite shows.  We ate more beans and rice.  We waited for movies to come out on video and then borrowed them when our friends rented them instead of going to the theater. &lt;g&gt;  We went on picnics to the park with peanut butter sandwiches instead of going out for lunch.  We changed our phone service to a cheaper one.  We sold some stuff.  We walked more places. We looked at where we could cut back and did that.   We didn&#39;t get rid of our kid or our critters but I guess we could have.  That choice wouldn&#39;t have been consistent with our principles, though. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we were in a crunch again now I wouldn&#39;t get rid of our cable service because Dylan ins liking some things on TV right now and I wouldn&#39;t bugger that up for him.  But I could quit my bottled water habit and my smelly hand lotion habit and make other changes to save money that wouldn&#39;t cost our kid his comfort and happiness. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are some creative unschooling mom&#39;s finding ways to make a little extra cash.  Maybe some will share their ideas with you.  I went to work two days a week when our vet bills became more than our budget could absorb.  I work early, and am usually home by the time my kid gets up in the early afternoon.  <br/>\n<br/>\n Debt is a bummer but debt will, unfortunately,  wait for you.  Your kid can&#39;t wait.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288405080,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"&quot;diana jenner&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: I really need some inspiration, please help","postDate":"1204484742","msgId":30398,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDgwMzAyMTEwNWk2NzY3MDEyMXZjMjk3NjhjOTRhM2QxOGRlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwODEwMWM4N2M5MiRlNjdkYzI1MCQwMjAxYThjMEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwODEwMWM4N2M5MiRlNjdkYzI1MCQwMjAxYThjMEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4="},"prevInTopic":30396,"nextInTopic":30399,"prevInTime":30396,"nextInTime":30399,"topicId":30362,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Just thinking about about being away from Sophia makes me feel guilty, what the heck is wrong with me????????*** There s nothing wrong, it s your Mommy","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-745624283\">***Just thinking about about<br/>\nbeing away from Sophia makes me feel guilty, what the heck is wrong<br/>\nwith me????????***<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing wrong, it&#39;s your Mommy Radar telling you that being away<br/>\nfrom Sophia is *not* the right thing to do.<br/>\nJust to put your story into my perspective: Hannah had a bloody nose mid<br/>\nJanuary 2006 and was dead by Feb 24, a mere 6 weeks later.

How many days a week?  That&#39;s a mistake if you want to unschool.   Maybe the problem is you want to say you&#39;re an unschooler for some reason for yourself but you haven&#39;t giving enough thought to what it means for your daughter.  You won&#39;t create an interesting home life for her if you make excuses why she can&#39;t be home.   If you ever hope to be dedicated to unschooling, sending her out to programs, by herself, while you stare at walls, will not get you there.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***Just thinking about about<br/>\nbeing away from Sophia makes me feel guilty, what the heck is wrong<br/>\nwith me????????***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt SHOULD bother you to be away from her.  She&#39;s six.  Your her mom.   Maybe I misunderstood what you meant here but it looks like you suspect there&#39;s something wrong with you because you feel guilty about ditching your kid.    The problem is not your guilt.  The problem is the thing that&#39;s urging you to put her in a program.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***I also feel over run and trapped by the dogs (why did I get another<br/>\npuppy???).***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy *did* you get a puppy?   <br/>\n<br/>\nAre you in the habit of acting before you&#39;ve thought a thing through?  Did you decide to unschool in the same way you decided to get a puppy? <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might deepen your understanding of unschooling, or decide against it, if you were to read a lot about unschooling and write (not necessarily to anyone, but writing for yourself) about what your hopes are for your child and what your goals are as a mother.  Lots of understanding can happen through writing.  It may be that your thoughts, understanding and dedication to unschooling are superficial and more research will help you decide one way or another. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re not trapped.  Of the other beings you&#39;ve mentioned in your post, you are the only one with the power and legal right to make your circumstances different.  You can pack a bag and leave in the next ten minutes and never come back, but your child can&#39;t change her life without you&#39;re help and the puppy can&#39;t make his/her life better without your help.    You have all the power and you&#39;re writing like you&#39;re the powerless one in this situation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFind a neighborhood kid to come walk the dogs two or three times a day.  Pay the kid to do that for you.  It will be liberating for you and a kindness to your puppy and a good thing for the kid. Everybody wins.    Or *better yet*, get out and walk the dogs yourself, with your daughter, and explore your neighborhood and town, and delight in your puppy.   The exercise will help your mental state and the walk will be a nice way to spend time with your kid and your puppy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not fond of advice to get rid of animals if they&#39;re taking up some of your time.  Like children we owe them our responsible dedication.  If you made a hasty decision in getting a puppy, well, that&#39;s a bummer, but the puppy still needs a responsible person to care for him/her.  You can choose to enjoy the complications of life with a puppy.  We ALL have to find ways to figure out how to live in our lives.  It&#39;s not unique to you that there are details to take care of and problems to solve and new things to get used to every day.  That&#39;s what life is and the sooner you can embrace your own wonderful human adaptability the happier you will be.&lt;g&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my husband and I were moving from Alaska to Montana with a new baby, a dog, four cats and a rabbit, my sister in law said &quot;Why not leave the animals there, it will be easier.&quot;   I forgave her because she was obviously INSANE, but it did help me see that &quot;Easy&quot; wasn&#39;t what I wanted.  I wanted a move that caused the least possible stress to my family and my family included my critters.  Easy for me was not my goal, but I had become stressed with the work of moving and lost track of what my real goal was.  I had been focusing on myself when what I needed was to focus on the goal.   <br/>\n<br/>\nPuppyless, is not the goal.  Kidless is not the goal.  The goal is happiness and it can be achieved more perfectly with a puppy and a kid.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nGet up a couple hours before your kid in the morning so you can have some quiet time, or stay up a couple hours later than she does.    The single most effective thing I&#39;ve ever found for improving mental health is exercise.  Get lots, even if you jump rope in your bedroom.  Whatever you can fit in will benefit you in remarkable ways.  And stop dwelling on yourself.  Get busy with other people.  Do things for your puppy and for your kid.  Doing for others is a wonderful way to put your own self in perspective.  Really.  None of us are so important that we deserve most of own attention.&lt;g&gt;   I know there&#39;s lots of writing out there about finding yourself, yada, yada, but honest to Pete, whatever you&#39;d accomplish by making music or staring at a wall will pale in comparison to what you will accomplish by dedicating yourself to making a joyful life for your family.   Talk about feeling good and changing the world?  Exalt a kid.  Give a dog a happy life.  Your inner whatever will be overflowing.      <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is a choice and if you make the choice to unschool you&#39;ll need to make choices that support unschooling *everyday*.  You can&#39;t just say to yourself, &quot;Ok, I&#39;m unschooling&quot; and then sit back and wonder how it will all unfold.  You need to be an active participant in the choices you&#39;re making.&lt;g&gt;   Identify why you want to unschool and then make choices consistent with what you want.  You are empowered.  You have complete control.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a child and a puppy is a choice.  How you think about your life is a choice.  You can choose to think you&#39;re trapped and over run, or you can choose to think more positively about the life you&#39;ve made.  Everyone needs to find ways to handle the details of life.   Alone time or &quot;me time&quot; will not sustain you in any magical way that can&#39;t be achieved through a change in thinking.  Put the energy you&#39;re willing to spend on finding ways to get time alone into finding ways to have fun with your family.  You&#39;ll all be happier.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Dylan was six we lived in a very small house.  So small you probably can&#39;t picture how small.  My brother thought I was joking when I said &quot;You can stand in the middle of any room, take one big step and be in the next room.&quot; and laughed himself silly when he came for a visit.    We lived there seven years with Dylan, two dogs (one was a Basenji, so really that&#39;s like having six dogs&lt;g&gt;), five cats and a rabbit.  Dylan had friends over many times during the week.  We had three chairs in the living room and one of those was the piano bench. &lt;g&gt;   In the summer, David&#39;s nieces and nephews would visit us.  They could have stayed with their grandmother in her larger house but they *liked* our house.   To improve my mental state I would get up at two or three in the morning, whatever time my husband got up for work, and while he was getting ready, I&#39;d go out for a run.  <br/>\n<br/>\n We made an outside living space with lawn chairs.  We made the yard inviting, with bird feeders and flowers and a sandbox, a swing and a garden.  We made sidewalk art and used the side of an old barn at the back of the lot for a place to hang a dart board.   Much of life was lived outside in the good weather.  Being busy and outside is good for mental health.  Go for walks, drives, bike rides, hikes.  If it&#39;s still snowy where you are go play in the snow, go sledding, find a place to skate, build an igloo, make a snowman.   If you don&#39;t have ideas about what to do to make life more fun, ask here.  Look in your local yellow pages for places you haven&#39;t visited yet or haven&#39;t been to in awhile.   Go on line to your local visitors center and see what your community recommends for tourists.  Be a tourist for a week.    <br/>\n<br/>\nDo more with your kid instead of looking for ways to do without her.  Not only will that help you get closer to unschooling, it will help you get closer to your kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] DOGS was: I really need some inspiration, please help","postDate":"1204478832","msgId":30393,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYwMzc1NC4xODMyMi5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGZxZW4yNyt1b3FkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30392,"nextInTopic":30395,"prevInTime":30392,"nextInTime":30394,"topicId":30362,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I understand.

Not only<br/>\nseasonal depression but also more. 2 years ago I had a melt down and<br/>\nwas put on meds for depression and anxiety. I am weaning off those<br/>\nmeds now and it makes it rough. I have been off of one of the<br/>\nmedications for a year but the other one is one of the hardest to come<br/>\noff of because of the severe physical with drawls. I have been<br/>\ndecreasing the dose slowly under Dr.&#39;s supervision. I am down from 150<br/>\nmg a day to now only 25mg a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do take a B Complex as well as other suppliments and it does help.

I also got a cat door that can be put in a basement window so<br/>\nthat the cats can let themselves in and out (I can&#39;t count how many<br/>\ntimes a day I open doors for cats) without having to be harassed by<br/>\nthe dogs when they come upstairs for me to let them out. I&#39;ll see if<br/>\nDH can help me install it tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my words made it sound like my house is worse than it is. The<br/>\ncats boxes are cleaned twice a day and Zoe (an almost 2 yo Australian<br/>\nshepherd) is totally house broken. Clarabelle (Border Collie/Blue<br/>\nHeeler) is only 12 weeks old and is still learning about going outside<br/>\nso she does have accidents but they are cleaned up right away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dogs however have not gotten the exercise and attention that they<br/>\nneed to behave like nice polite doggies. They are jumping on people<br/>\nand wrestling through the living room. They need to be walked and<br/>\ntrained more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mess in my house is mostly people mess. Piles of books, papers,<br/>\ndh&#39;s gaming and art stuff, my music stuff, unschooling a 5 year stuff<br/>\n(markers, paper, inventions, etc.), laundry, dishes.

Just something to ponder.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":133458510,"authorName":"Rachel","from":"&quot;Rachel&quot; &lt;radle12000@...&gt;","profile":"radle12000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"I really need some inspiration, please help","postDate":"1204390105","msgId":30362,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZxYzFjcCtsY2dwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30375,"prevInTime":30361,"nextInTime":30363,"topicId":30362,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The following is an e-mail that I sent to a local unschooling friend who unschools her 2 children.I think it is probably the first truly honest correspondence","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1364969081\">The following is an e-mail that I sent to a local unschooling friend<br/>\nwho unschools her 2 children.I think it is probably the first truly<br/>\nhonest correspondence I have written about how I am feeling about<br/>\nunschooling Sophia who will be 6 in a week.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nMeg (16) has changed her mind about graduating in May so  I am free to<br/>\ngo to LIG. If you are still interested in carpooling there let me<br/>\nknow. I could really really really use some inspiration at this point<br/>\nto keep unschooling Sophia.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am having a very rough time right now and keep thinking about taking<br/>\nthe easy way out and putting Soph  in school, but I know that that is<br/>\nnot the answer. I have learned over the years not to make any life<br/>\nchanging decisions at this time of year since I get a little crazy and<br/>\nrestless with spring fever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did register her for the after school program at the (local<br/>\ncommunity center) since it is totally up to us when and how long she<br/>\ngoes and I can get some much needed alone time (without having to be<br/>\nscrutinized by G-ma&#39;s). The after kindergarten program runs from 11:30<br/>\nto 6:30 so there is quite a lot of time for me to be alone and make<br/>\nsome music or just stare blankly at a wall. Just thinking about about<br/>\nbeing away from Sophia makes me feel guilty, what the heck is wrong<br/>\nwith me????????<br/>\n<br/>\nI also feel over run and trapped by the dogs (why did I get another<br/>\npuppy???). I am very limited in how long I can be away and I am not<br/>\nliking that at all right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel <br/>\n------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I am looking for advice or just some words of<br/>\nencouragement, or for someone to ask me the not so easy questions to<br/>\nask, or for someone to just kick me in the butt with the brutally<br/>\nhonest words telling me to suck it up. But what I do need is support<br/>\nto keep unschooling Sophia which in my heart I know is the best thing<br/>\nI could do for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way we have 4 cats and 2 dogs who seem to run the house and<br/>\ndisturb our sleep, the house is a wreck (I would not let my sister who<br/>\nwas visiting from out of state come over because of the mess, she<br/>\nworks for Head-start).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother of my sisters for some reason insists that I am a pot smoker<br/>\n(which I am not) and tells people so. I don&#39;t have a problem with pot<br/>\nsmoking, it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t do it and don&#39;t want to give any more<br/>\nreason for people to think I am &quot;off my rocker&quot; than I am truly<br/>\nentitled to. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdd to that, we are very much in debt and going deeper every month<br/>\nwhich makes going back to work very appealing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is more to this situation but I have to go and if I don&#39;t send<br/>\nthis now, it will get deleted later.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp me sort this out so I can enjoy my girls instead of dreading<br/>\nbeing a mom.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30316,"nextTopicId":30474}}
