And even though she also<br/>\nhelped me in the kitchen all the time, the playset was one of her<br/>\nfavorite toys.  As siblings came along, they adopted it as the older<br/>\none moved on to other things.  With Keon we bought a ton of plastic<br/>\nfruits and veggies that could be cut in half with a small plastic<br/>\nknife (they velcroed together)  They all fit in a plastic rubbermaid<br/>\ntype tote with the stove and the various pots and pans that we had<br/>\npurchased over theyears.  Keon still loves to &quot;play&quot; in the kitchen,<br/>\neven though he no longer plays with the stove and veggies.  He dreams<br/>\nof being a chef and even had a garden this year so he could cook the<br/>\nveggies from it.  The kids have always been invited into the kitchen<br/>\nto help me.  They&#39;ve been baking, and mixing and stirring and chopping<br/>\nsince they were old enough to stand on a chair at the counter.  They<br/>\nall know how to cook various things and are familiar with different<br/>\ntools and their uses.

Also, I <br/>\nremember one of my fav. things to do when I was into playing kitchen <br/>\nwhen I was a kid was making &#39;foodstuffs&#39; out of playdoh and letting <br/>\nit dry and then having little &#39;fried eggs&#39; or mashed potatoes or <br/>\nwhatever (this was in the days before Fisher Price made the plastic <br/>\nplay food)... Perhaps you could gift her some playdoh (or make it <br/>\nhomemade so you&#39;ll have just the right colors to make food with) <br/>\nalong with the cubes... Or pitch the whole idea and give her a <br/>\nkitchen. LOL! Just an idea. I searched for the sort of thing I am <br/>\ntalking about online and here is a link to give you an idea of what <br/>\nI am talking about:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ezcube.info/components/ComponentDetail.asp?p=1\">http://www.ezcube.info/components/ComponentDetail.asp?p=1</a><br/>\nAlthough in this particular line I didn&#39;t see the &#39;drawer&#39; type of <br/>\ncube I am thinking of...

My older dd <br/>\ngot her some more play food for her birthday as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love play kitchen stuff - some of it is just adorable.  Sometimes <br/>\nBrenna just plays with it on her own, and sometimes she has a <br/>\nrestaurant or shop for us to visit.
