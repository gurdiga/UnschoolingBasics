I appreciate what you said. In my stronger moments I<br/>\ntotally agree:) In my weaker moments, with unsupportive people talking<br/>\nto me I get lost. It isnt that my family is just being mean, they have<br/>\nall been brainwashed for so long they dont know any different. I told<br/>\nthe state my 17 year old has decided to quit schooling. In a way, I wish<br/>\nI hadnt done that. I know they have called me. I missed the call. Maybe<br/>\nthey will give me an option I wont want to refuse. This child is so<br/>\nwounded. He has gotten employment and has kept it for over a year now.<br/>\nHe is never late and went through a hell of an innitiation by older<br/>\nboys. They were so mean. On top of that he is sensitive about his<br/>\nlearning disability/ability to be different. He is pulling away from me<br/>\nbecause he is 17 and yet is still very injured by life. I keep letting<br/>\nhim know I am here. He has made some unhealthy drug-related choices<br/>\nlately. I think he is back on track. He has had therapy and refuses to<br/>\ngo now. The family and I did an intervention and buoyed him up. We all<br/>\ntold him how much he means to us and that we love him and are here for<br/>\nhim. I hope our hearts are enough and yet I am aware, at times love<br/>\ndoesnt deter a person from hurting themselves. So I have my awareness<br/>\nlevel up surrounding him. I think from all the brainwashing that he<br/>\nwouldnt accept a diploma/graduation ceremony, etc. from unschooling<br/>\nbecause he didnt &quot;earn&quot; it. :( It wouldnt seem &quot;real&quot; because it didnt<br/>\ncome from the usual black and white thought forms that the majority use<br/>\nregarding schooling. It does take a leap of faith after all the<br/>\nbrainwashing to think there could be some sort of alternative ways. It<br/>\nis sad because I think if he could believe it may be a form of healing<br/>\non a level that would benefit him. I am here. My heart is with his. <br/>\nI am so grateful that this list, and you Ren, are here. It is helping me<br/>\nmend my broken heart so that I can be here in the &quot;now&quot; for my<br/>\nkids/family. Glad you and yours are safe. Blessings for you, Michele<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5708,"nextTopicId":5706}}
