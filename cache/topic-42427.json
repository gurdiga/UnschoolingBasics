Is it people using the phone for the  <br/>\namount of time a child would use it per day?<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter safe than sorry is a useful strategy when people make  <br/>\ndecisions for themselves. They only inconvenience and limit  <br/>\nthemselves and they&#39;ve decided that&#39;s less trouble than digging into  <br/>\nreports and finding out what the level of confidence is in the danger  <br/>\nand to whom. For example, for me it was loads easier to chuck the  <br/>\naluminum cookware years ago than to figure out if there was any solid  <br/>\nevidence to connect them with Alzheimer&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when making decisions for someone else, no matter how much we  <br/>\nwant our fear induced protection to feel like love, it never can feel  <br/>\nthat way to the one being limited.

Our good intentions don&#39;t change what our actions  <br/>\nclearly communicate: that our needs (to soothe our fears) are more  <br/>\nimportant than theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean throwing caution to the wind and just saying yes to  <br/>\neverything. It means deciding that supporting our kids and our  <br/>\nrelationship with them is more important than supporting our fears  <br/>\nfor them. It means, therefore, putting in the time to look at both  <br/>\nsides of an issue objectively. It also means seeking out more choices  <br/>\nthan just no and yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: 6 yo. dd wants cell phone for xmas, DH  says no way","postDate":"1261128182","msgId":42451,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzOTY3LjE5OTQyLnFtQHdlYjg2MjAzLm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDM2NDRjMGIzMDkxMjE3MTg1M2wxM2U1NmRkM3FlNjEwY2M1MTFiMGEyNTk0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDg1NTg2NS4zODQ0LnFtQHdlYjU5NDA0Lm1haWwuYWM0LnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gIDxCRjFFRkVBMy0zNEM2LTQxQ0MtQkVBMi05RjlCOEMxOUM5NUFAZ21haWwuY29tPiA8MzY0NGMwYjMwOTEyMTcxODUzbDEzZTU2ZGQzcWU2MTBjYzUxMWIwYTI1OTRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":42445,"nextInTopic":42453,"prevInTime":42450,"nextInTime":42452,"topicId":42427,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"________________________________ What  I  have read/heard about it is in cases where exposure was constant and long term. ex: higher instance of  bone cancer","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2027114256\">________________________________<br/>\nWhat  I  have read/heard about it is in cases where exposure was constant<br/>\nand long term. ex: higher instance of  bone cancer in cops&#39;/emts&#39; hips due<br/>\nto keeping a cell phone/walkie-talkie there for years.<br/>\n=========================================<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a link to the U.S. National Cancer Associations take on the risk<br/>\nof Radio Frequency and cancer: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones.\">http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones.</a> It&#39;s a measured examination of the risk. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know a<br/>\nfair number of pre-teens and teens who use cell phones fairly<br/>\nregularly, mostly they aren&#39;t holding them next to their heads (the risk factor), mostly they are texting or listening to music on the mp3<br/>\nplayer function. When I use my mobile phone, I use it to call and talk<br/>\nto people. I&#39;m not a big texter. Linnaea, my 9 year old daughter, likes to have the mobile with her when she&#39;s not with David or I. And she likes to call Simon when he&#39;s stayed home and we&#39;ve all gone out. She&#39;s not into texting, yet, I imagine that will come. She really enjoys communicating with people. She likes being on the headset on the xbox and chatting throughout games of Halo 3. I don&#39;t imagine that a vague and so far unfounded fear of brain tumors will keep me from getting her a mobile phone when she feels she would use it enough to justify not just taking the family one more frequently. <br/>\n<br/>\n==========================================<br/>\n<br/>\nOur motto: Everything in Moderation<br/>\n<br/>\n==========================================<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that was written about the possible risk of cell phone exposure. But the statement everything in moderation is really not helpful. Also the addition of &quot;Our motto&quot;, is it really each member of your families motto? I don&#39;t have such a motto. I&#39;d be much more likely to push the &quot;Go with your passions&quot; kind of motto if I were to declare a family motto. Although, that&#39;s optional too. If they don&#39;t really want to go with their passions, if they want to talk about and explore and expand on their passions without actually fully leaping into a passionate fray, that&#39;s fine too. <br/>\n<br/>\nWho decides what is moderate and what is immoderate? Who decides what an immoderate level of strawberry eating is? or an immoderate level of computer use? or an immoderate amount of bouncing on the trampoline? I think a motto about everything and the level of use could become quite a relationship damaging motto to maintain. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t do much with moderation. I do things that I want to do when I want to do them, largely, within the constraints of a life without infinite resources or time. I don&#39;t know if my life would be viewed as a moderated life or an immoderate one. It isn&#39;t among my neuroses to worry about that, however. So, I don&#39;t press for moderation from the other people in my life, nor do a monitor them for going with their passions. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139413400,"authorName":"Amy","from":"Amy &lt;quinlonsma@...&gt;","profile":"quinlonsma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] OT: cheap cell phones","postDate":"1261117893","msgId":42445,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU4ODU1My42OTEwNC5xbUB3ZWI1MjAwNy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhnZTM4bStuYjJ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42443,"nextInTopic":42451,"prevInTime":42444,"nextInTime":42446,"topicId":42427,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you have a Verizon account with 2 lines & 1400 minutes a month.

I believe plans start  <br/>\nat about $50. We use a slightly higher (but not much plan since we  <br/>\ndon&#39;t have a land line). This includes two phones. Then it is $10 per  <br/>\nmonth for each additional phone up to 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor an additional fee of $20 we have unlimited text and photo  <br/>\nmessaging for everyone on our plan.

At some point, there&#39;s just no more room in the budget - and I  <br/>\n&gt; mean none whatsoever, not &quot;I&#39;d have to pull it from savings&quot; or &quot;I&#39;d  <br/>\n&gt; have to forgo a trip to Starbucks&quot;. So I can relate to the idea that  <br/>\n&gt; certain things come out of a kid&#39;s allowance in that sense, when its  <br/>\n&gt; the only money that&#39;s not otherwise allocated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There have been weeks where I haven&#39;t given Mo an allowance at all,  <br/>\n&gt; or given her half the usual, because that was all there was after  <br/>\n&gt; expenses. Right now I&#39;m not giving allowances at all, in fact, since  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m on a temporary (I hope) layoff, and I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;ll go  <br/>\n&gt; back to the same system once I&#39;m working again. It seems like its  <br/>\n&gt; pretty confusing for Morgan, rather than helpful, so I&#39;m sort of  <br/>\n&gt; playing the matter by ear. I don&#39;t know if the variability is part  <br/>\n&gt; of the issue or not, but I think the bigger trouble is that its such  <br/>\n&gt; a small amount that its really hard to save up for things she wants.  <br/>\n&gt; I know that&#39;s something other parents have mentioned in the past,  <br/>\n&gt; that it helps when there&#39;s enough allowance money for kids to be  <br/>\n&gt; able to spend a little *and* save too, but that&#39;s not one of the  <br/>\n&gt; options available in my life right now. Some weeks, there&#39;s not  <br/>\n&gt; enough for either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t mentioned Ray in all this have I? While we do pay for  <br/>\n&gt; certain things for him on a regular basis, we haven&#39;t been giving  <br/>\n&gt; him any kind of cash allowance, have been relying on him being able  <br/>\n&gt; to do paid work for his own money. He regularly makes more than I  <br/>\n&gt; could afford to give him. I&#39;m not altogether happy about that (I  <br/>\n&gt; mean, I&#39;m glad he has money at all, but wish there were more I could  <br/>\n&gt; give).

At some point, there&#39;s just no more room in the budget - and I mean none whatsoever, not &quot;I&#39;d have to pull it from savings&quot; or &quot;I&#39;d have to forgo a trip to Starbucks&quot;. So I can relate to the idea that certain things come out of a kid&#39;s allowance in that sense, when its the only money that&#39;s not otherwise allocated. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been weeks where I haven&#39;t given Mo an allowance at all, or given her half the usual, because that was all there was after expenses. Right now I&#39;m not giving allowances at all, in fact, since I&#39;m on a temporary (I hope) layoff, and I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;ll go back to the same system once I&#39;m working again. It seems like its pretty confusing for Morgan, rather than helpful, so I&#39;m sort of playing the matter by ear. I don&#39;t know if the variability is part of the issue or not, but I think the bigger trouble is that its such a small amount that its really hard to save up for things she wants. I know that&#39;s something other parents have mentioned in the past, that it helps when there&#39;s enough allowance money for kids to be able to spend a little *and* save too, but that&#39;s not one of the options available in my life right now. Some weeks, there&#39;s not enough for either. <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t mentioned Ray in all this have I? While we do pay for certain things for him on a regular basis, we haven&#39;t been giving him any kind of cash allowance, have been relying on him being able to do paid work for his own money. He regularly makes more than I could afford to give him. I&#39;m not altogether happy about that (I mean, I&#39;m glad he has money at all, but wish there were more I could give). In a sense, you could say that those things we pay for Ray are his &quot;allowance&quot; or budget or what-have-you. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m always reluctant to post these sorts of details, frankly, because so often when I hear/read parents saying &quot;we don&#39;t have money&quot; for some kid desire they really Do have the money, its just allocated somewhere else - savings, most commonly, but sometimes other non-essentials.

One thing we did early on was to set the first speed dial number (2) on each phone to call the other (so DH&#39;s phone 2+dial button calls me, on my phone 2+dial button calls DH) that way if DS needed to get one of us quickly he could (DH and DS are home during the day while I&#39;m at work - I wanted DS to be able to call me if DH got hurt or something). Then, when we were at unschooling conferences, we&#39;d have DS take one phone and one of us had the other and he could always get us (for instance, if he wanted to stay in the toy/play room and DH and I were at a funshop or talk, provided of course that DS was okay with us being someplace else for 30 minutes or whatever - and we had a whole process/plan that we used/use for those type situations). DS liked it because he was still &#39;connected&#39; even if we were some yards away. As he got a little older (8-9), he would text us quick bits like &quot;come here&quot; or &quot;where are you&quot; - easier to handle texting if there&#39;s background noise. Then, last year (he was 10 ½), we were again heading to the phone store - the antenna area of DH&#39;s cell phone had cracked, among other things, so we went in for our free upgrades. And, as usual, asked DS if he wanted a phone. He pondered a bit then said Yes, I think it would be useful now. So, okay, he now has a shiny red phone. None of us have the fancy 3G/4G does everything but cook dinner phones - we can call, text, take and send pix (which is one of the reasons we originally got phones - so that I could see what kinds of adventures they were having during the day). And, now that we do craft fairs many times per year, it&#39;s quite handy that DS has his own phone - he can roam the event, text us if he finds something cool that he wants us to see, he can even stay home for short times when we&#39;re not too far away. Other than that, he doesn&#39;t much use his phone; he&#39;s definitely not using it to call Mongolia or whatever. It can access the Internet but it&#39;s super slow - his laptop is way faster access to the Internet. Maybe, someday, he&#39;ll ask for a phone that can do all sorts of fancy stuff. Odds are, by then, he&#39;ll be grown and doing his own thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

It will have a finite number of minutes that she won&#39;t be able to go over. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had planned on getting both our 5 and 7 yr olds phones for Christmas. We ran into the snag that the smart phones they want now have a monthly fees of $30 dollars each in addition to the regular $10 dollars a month for the phone service. $80 a month for the kids to have cell phones is out of our budget range. We are trying to find a way for them to get the phones they want and still have it only cost us the $10 each a month for the service. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t really go anywhere without us. They are always with either us or their grandparents BUT it&#39;s important to them. Also, I think texting might be a really fun way to learn to read and write.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove and Laughter,<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\nsnugglebugg.com/sagepixie<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77228268,"authorName":"Marla","from":"&quot;Marla&quot; &lt;marla@...&gt;","profile":"hilltowner4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"6 yo. dd wants cell phone for xmas, DH says no way","postDate":"1261019772","msgId":42427,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhnYzdwcys5djBsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":42428,"prevInTime":42426,"nextInTime":42428,"topicId":42427,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Last year, my then-5 yo. wanted a cell phone for Christmas.

I gave it some thought and decided to get her a pair of cell phone walkie-talkies instead.  She said they were o.k., but that she still wanted a real cell phone.  Throughout the year she kept reminding me that she wanted a real cell phone.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo, this year I gave it some thought and decided that I would get a cheap go-phone and one month of minutes(if anyone knows the cheapest way to go about this, let me know - lol).  None of her friend&#39;s has a cell-phone, not even her 10 yo. sister (who doesn&#39;t even want email).  The only people she might call would be her grandma, her aunt, and maybe a friend or twos house.  I&#39;m kind of hoping that she&#39;ll enjoy it the first week and then tire of it - lol.  She doesn&#39;t even talk on our phone much.  I am going to let her know that we will pay for the first month and then she can use her allowance if she wants to continue with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh says there is no way she is getting a phone.  That he hears all these stories about his co-workers kids ringing up incredible bills for talking and especially texting (my 6 yo. can barely read let alone write - lol).  He feels that it&#39;s a waste of money.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate others input.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarla</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42470,"nextTopicId":42472}}
