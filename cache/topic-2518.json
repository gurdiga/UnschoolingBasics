If I were going to  <br/>\ninvest some money in something, it would be their books (we have dozens---my  <br/>\nfavorite is the one on castles!). You could read about WWII or dinosaurs or dog <br/>\n training.<br/>\n <br/>\nActual living, breathing people would be my next suggestion. People who  have <br/>\nLIVED it (like WWII vets)---or who are immersed in and passionate about it  <br/>\n(like SCAers or dog trainers).<br/>\n <br/>\nThe third option would be to DO some of the things, like participate  in <br/>\nliving history museums/reinactments or go on a dinosaur dig or train the  dog.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor example----you could READ about unschooling, and you&#39;d learn a lot.

I also still find myself bringing home workbooks.  Not that they HAVE to do them but secretly, my schooled mind wants them to do the workbooks for &quot;fun&quot;.  I think so I can have the peace of mind and &quot;proof&quot; for those panicky moments.  &lt;SIGH&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI did get a DK Encyclopedia of animals that my son LOVES and he pretends to jump into it to learn about the animals.  (Think Stanley.)  He uses it in conjunction with the stuffed animals and PVC animals he has.  So I don&#39;t think not buying books of ANY kind is necessary but I do think I need to curb MY desire to have shelves and shelves of books and just grab the ones that will become lifelong favourites.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, I actually was posting to say that to the list above I&#39;d add magnets.  We got a cool (very inexpensive) building set made of little magnets with metal balls but even before that we had some horseshoe magnets and my kids have done so much neat discovery/fun games with magnets.  That or any kind of building sets really.  I hear good things about K&#39;Nex though i haven&#39;t any yet or lego brand.  We build with the magnets now but maybe will invest in some K&#39;Nex soon.<br/>\n <br/>\nTreasure life,<br/>\n <br/>\nJonni-Ann <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

A lot of the stuff I chose has<br/>\nsat unused. $50 on a video game she plays is a much better use of money than<br/>\n$50 on great books that never get opened. My daughter has gotten way more<br/>\nuse out of stuffed animals than the Dorling Kindersley Encyclopedia I<br/>\nbought.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a lover of great books it&#39;s hard for me to admit that the library and the<br/>\ninternet and TV (and videos) are better resources than shelves and shelves<br/>\nof books at home. The truth won&#39;t stop me from buying books! But I&#39;ve slowed<br/>\nway down.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve bought books that Kat wanted read over and over.

If he loves pouring over the details (or<br/>\nhaving you pour over the details) of Usborne or DK books, get some. If he&#39;s<br/>\nnot looking longingly at something wondering when you can get it again when<br/>\nyou return something to the library, then the library is the best place for<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;d say spend money on things he likes and will use. Throw in some things<br/>\nthat you will use. And then have turn over of temporary things running<br/>\nthrough his live, places to go (people to see! ;-).
