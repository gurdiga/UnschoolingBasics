My husband reads all the<br/>\ntime, but in 20 years of marriage I&#39;ve seen him read maybe 2 novels for<br/>\npleasure. His &#39;pleasure&#39; reading is theology, philosophy, history, the<br/>\nhistory of history......If I read, it&#39;s for pleasure. I love to get lost in<br/>\na book. I cannot get myself to read the stuff he reads for &#39;pleasure&#39;. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t like to read for information. Is one better than the other? Is one<br/>\nmore important? These were hard concepts for me. I was an early reader and<br/>\nread volumes, mostly for escape, as I was growing up. I thought that was<br/>\nnormal. Imagine my surprise when my kids were not early readers!! And I have<br/>\nquite a variety. Kate will read anything, fiction or non, for pleasure or<br/>\ninformation. Lisa prefers to read non-fiction. She probably has dyslexia and<br/>\nshe had to learn to read her way.  Karl didn&#39;t see any point in reading for<br/>\nthe longest time. He was 12 before he was reading and is just now at 14<br/>\nreading for pleasure. He&#39;s been reading game manuals and magazines. He just<br/>\ndiscovered Manga and devoured a whole series over Christmas. He is currently<br/>\nreading a book all about Zombies. It&#39;s a huge thick book. More than I<br/>\nthought there was to know about zombies! It&#39;s the first book he has read<br/>\nfrom beginning to end. He is loving it and I know he is comprehending<br/>\nbecause I am learning more about zombies than I ever thought I wanted to<br/>\nknow. My youngest read at a much younger age than the others and loves to<br/>\nread for fun and pleasure. Each and every one reads for the reasons that is<br/>\nright for them. Each of them read what they need right now. Late reading,<br/>\ndyslexia, not wanting to read....in the end it doesn&#39;t really matter.

Between showing me a magic bit he&#39;s working on and some false <br/>\nshuffles, listening to Phish and Danny Schmidt, and chatting about stuff, he would pick up that book and <br/>\nREAD!  Blow me away! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nBut I really DID trust that he would come to it in his own time in his own way. It happens to be drumming <br/>\n(!) that&#39;s gotten him reading. Go figure! We&#39;ve subscribed him to Relix and Modern Drummer magazines too. <br/>\nHe also reads them cover-to-cover.<br/>\n <br/>\nI tease him about it just a little. But he&#39;s eighteen next week, and understands unschooling totally now. <br/>\nHe can take a little ribbing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nOH! And we ALL prefer non-fiction to fiction here.

Stuff that we&#39;ve talked about before<br/>\nlike grocery shopping, cooking, planning trips, closed captioning on<br/>\ntv, etc.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it all counts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two older boys that don&#39;t really read for pleasure...not novels<br/>\nor storybooks anyway. They read magazines about topics they&#39;re<br/>\ninterested in (computers and video games mainly) they read a LOT on<br/>\ntheir pc and video games, and of course the day to day stuff we all<br/>\nencounter.<br/>\nI naturally assumed all of my children would love to read for pleasure<br/>\n(many years ago) but not all people do. And that&#39;s ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those that worry about reading, keep breathing deep and trusting<br/>\nthe process. Jared (12) only started reading with proficiency this year.<br/>\nIf there&#39;s one thing I can&#39;t say enough it&#39;s TRUST THE PROCESS...which<br/>\nis basically trusting your child and their unique way of approaching<br/>\nthe whole world.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9167,"nextTopicId":9116}}
