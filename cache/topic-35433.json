Other than relying on patient<br/>\nfeedback to make a diagnosis, what else do you expect them to do in order to<br/>\ndetermine if there&#39;s a health problem?  If you get unsolicited advice about<br/>\nparenting, just ignore it.  But you *are* soliciting for medical advice and<br/>\nyou may get advice that you don&#39;t want.  That&#39;s always a risk when you go<br/>\nsee a doctor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3879588,"authorName":"HSlater351@aol.com","from":"HSlater351@...","profile":"hslater351","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] toileting concern","postDate":"1219154280","msgId":35435,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJjZi4zMmUyYTIzZS4zNWRjMmI2OEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35433,"nextInTopic":35436,"prevInTime":35434,"nextInTime":35436,"topicId":35433,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Sharon!

My second born just turned seven. He has the exact same issue. He is  <br/>\ntoo busy to pee so he waits and waits and waits until he can&#39;t hold it <br/>\nanymore  and then he either doesn&#39;t tell anyone (so he can keep playing) or is <br/>\nstanding  or sitting in a puddle. For us I know that he has no physical issue with <br/>\nit  because he never does it when we are not at home and he has never wet the <br/>\nbed at  night. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy son finally seems to be over the hump with his accidents. I offered him  a <br/>\nportable toilet a few months ago as a way of brainstorming his problem. (&quot;I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to stop playing to go potty&quot;. &quot;Okay, what are somethings we can do  <br/>\nthat can help you not stop playing?&quot;) He seemed pretty thrilled with that <br/>\nidea  until we looked at the pictures online and he realized they were for <br/>\nbabies. At  that point I think a light went off in his head and he realized he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want  to do that anymore. <br/>\n <br/>\nYour son (and my son!) needs to realize that whatever fun they are  having is <br/>\nnot going to end because they took a two minute break to go to the  bathroom. <br/>\nWe have acted this out by &quot;freezing&quot; while he ran to the bathroom,  pausing <br/>\nvideo games, putting a bookmark in a book or even following him to  the <br/>\nbathroom so he would know we weren&#39;t playing without him. <br/>\n <br/>\nSince we have the same problem I am not sure how helpful I can be but I  <br/>\ndefinitely wanted to offer my support. I am fairly certain this is the first  time <br/>\nI have posted here. I really appreciate all of the stories and advice I  read <br/>\nhere. All of you make me a better Mom. :-) <br/>\n <br/>\nI also wanted to add that I have explained to him in detail why his  <br/>\naccidents take more time to clean up than they would take if he just used the  toilet <br/>\nbut I have never had him clean up his own pee. I think that&#39;s cruel. I  <br/>\nunderstand the logic but it does not work for me or my son. <br/>\n<br/>\nI  posted this issue almost a year ago on the RUNNY (Radical<br/>\nUNschoolers in  NY) group and got some great feedback about having<br/>\nacceptance without  expectations. I have been practicing that, but<br/>\nwondering if I am missing  something. My son just turned 6 a week ago.<br/>\nHe continues to urinate in his  pants sometimes. Sometimes it is just a<br/>\nlittle bit and other times he  completely wets himself. When I ask him<br/>\nabout this he says that he doesn&#39;t  want to take time out from playing,<br/>\nwatching TV, or whatever he happens to  be doing. I have also asked him<br/>\nif there is anything I can do to help him  with this and he has gotten<br/>\nangry and pushed me away. He does have days  when he stay dry all day<br/>\nand uses the potty regularly.<br/>\nOther than  asthma, he is a healthy child. Almost a year ago, I<br/>\ndiscussed this with the  doctor and he did not seem concerned about it<br/>\nbeing a health issue.  Although, the nurse did give me some unsolicited<br/>\nadvice on how I should  &quot;take control,&quot; make him clean it up, and set<br/>\nlimits with his  playtime.<br/>\nThis Friday, my son has his annual well child visit to the  doctor. I<br/>\nwant to inform her (this year it is a different doctor in the  same<br/>\npractice) about it, to be sure it is still not a health issue. <br/>\nI  want some RU support so that I can feel that I have alternatives in<br/>\ncase I  get some more unsolicited advice or they talk about the use of<br/>\nmedication  or testing (this may or may not come up).<br/>\nSharon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************It&#39;s only a deal if it&#39;s where you want to go.
