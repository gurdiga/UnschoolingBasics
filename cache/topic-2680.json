Do you know how common that is? Only in our age-<br/>\nsegregated, academically oriented society is that a &quot;problem&quot;. <br/>\nCripes! He was 2.5!!! I doubt the therapy had much to do with it at <br/>\nall....it&#39;s kind of like if you had therapy or a curriculum to teach <br/>\nbabies to walk and you started using it around 6months. Eventually <br/>\nthe child would walk and everyone would say how great the &quot;therapy&quot; <br/>\nor curriculum was, when in truth, the child was just READY.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Jalen had very few words in his vocabulary back in November when <br/>\nwe visited family in Alaska. He was 2.9. Most of the time he&#39;d point <br/>\nat things and say &quot;sttthhhhh&quot;. My Grandmother was a bit worried, I  <br/>\njust laughed at her and said &quot;he&#39;ll talk when he&#39;s ready&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess what? He went from hardly talking at ALL up until Jan/Feb. <br/>\nthen suddenly started putting two and three words together, then <br/>\nfull sentences, all within a few months. He talks up a storm now. <br/>\nComplex sentences, huge vocabulary and no problem communicating <br/>\nanything. He did it when he was ready. I knew he didn&#39;t have hearing <br/>\nproblems so we just let him BE.<br/>\nHe started talking proficiently almost overnight, a bit after his <br/>\nthird birthday. You wouldn&#39;t know he was any different than any <br/>\nother three year old today. WAIT...that&#39;s usually always my advice. <br/>\nTrust that they will learn what they need, when THEY need it.<br/>\nThat&#39;s the trust unschooling can give us.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2679,"nextTopicId":2681}}
