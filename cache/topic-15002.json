Hurting them would have been <br/>\nmy<br/>\n choice and I felt I deserved punishment for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Why would you hurt someone by choice in the first place?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think that would need to be explored first. Having never been hurt <br/>\nby people who love him, why would a child choose to hurt another?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes. I did post that later because I am being HONEST about me. But what<br/>\n does that have to do with anything? Plenty of times people do NOT react<br/>\n  with a hug first, but also do NOT react with ranting or railing. That <br/>\nwas<br/>\n  my point. In fact, most times I do not react first with ranting or <br/>\nrailing<br/>\n  and many times in fact a hug is involved AFTERWARD. In a situation <br/>\nsuch as<br/>\n  this I honestly could imagine myself ranting and railing just as Ren <br/>\nsaid<br/>\n  she did. That was why my whole question came up in the first place.. <br/>\nWhy<br/>\n  would we EXPECT ourselves to instinctively react with a hug? (please <br/>\ndo not<br/>\n  feel as if you need to re-explain this concept, I think I&#39;ve gotten it <br/>\nnow,<br/>\n  I am just re-listing her for clarification&#39;s sake as some people seem <br/>\nto<br/>\n think I am making hypocritical statements).<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  But you could by-pass the ranting and railing and just start with the <br/>\nhug. Why be mean if you will apologize later?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n An instinct is something you do without deliberating. So for me in that<br/>\n  type of a case and for Ren in that one example and for many others all <br/>\nthe<br/>\n  time it is called instinctive because it is. I am not saying it is a <br/>\nhappy<br/>\n thing, or something to be proud of, or even something that can NEVER be<br/>\n  changed. I am just arguing the fact that it is instinct. Protect the <br/>\nweak,<br/>\n  defend the underdog, prosecute the perpetrator. You do not have to <br/>\nagree<br/>\n  with me, I am only basing this on my realm of experience and do not <br/>\nclaim<br/>\n for it to be word of fact for all folks.<br/>\n<br/>\n --=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is typical parenting. There *is* a better way. I think we can <br/>\nprotect the weak and defend the underdog without &quot;persecuting he <br/>\nperpetrator.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;We&#39;d just like for you to look at it in a different way. To see your<br/>\n </span></blockquote> child as doing his *best* at all times.<br/>\n<br/>\n but why do you think YOU do and *I* don&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Because you refer to him as a &quot;perpetrator&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Again, I have NO PROBLEM with this. I am merely admitting that it is <br/>\nnot<br/>\n  instinct to me and I am not sure how to expect it to be. Marji has <br/>\ngiven me<br/>\n  the best idea to consider thus far in that the more we consciously <br/>\ndecide to<br/>\n  react in ta certain way (ex: hugs first) then the more possible it is <br/>\nthat<br/>\n  this will EVENTUALLY become our typical response. I see it as a <br/>\nhabituated<br/>\n  response, not necessarily instinctive.. Then again, why is my <br/>\ninstinctive<br/>\n reaction the way it is now? Is it truly all instinct or might be more<br/>\n  realistic to consider I have been habituated to react this way in the <br/>\nfirst<br/>\n place.. Ooo the web gets complicated ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Right. The more you *do* it, the easier---and almost second <br/>\nnature---it becomes.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You may be thinking that we all started out his way. For *many* of us, <br/>\nit&#39;s been a long, long process. Having been spanked as a child, my <br/>\nfirst response is to smack. It took a LOT to keep my hand stuck to my <br/>\n*own* leg and just yell. Then I quit yelling and just shook. &lt;g&gt; Duncan <br/>\nasked that I quit shaking! &lt;G&gt; Now I just take a deep breath. Works <br/>\nwonders!<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;He got consoled, he avoided Ben for an hour or so! &lt;G&gt;, and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>everything<br/>\n was fine in a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n  why did he need consolation? I want to make sure I understand. And as <br/>\nfar as<br/>\n avoiding Ben for an hour, I am sorry but I don&#39;t dig that. He hurt Ben<br/>\n  albeit accidentally and I would have rather he apologized genuinely <br/>\nand then<br/>\n interacted as normal.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Because he was sorry he hit Ben? He&#39;s only five. Overwhelmed?<br/>\n<br/>\n You can&#39;t *make* someone apologize genuinely.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;Let&#39;s not look at it as being unkind. Let&#39;s look at it as an accident<br/>\n </span></blockquote> or as not having the tools or experience to make a better decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ok, I guess I can&#39;t do that. The shoving was not an accident. Shoving <br/>\nis<br/>\n unkind. I agree with experience comes the possibility of making better<br/>\n  decisions but I do find it necessary to let them know right off that <br/>\nit is<br/>\n not ok.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  OK---You *are* assuming the worst---that the shoving was not an <br/>\naccident.<br/>\n<br/>\n He already knew it was not OK.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;Right. *LIFE* is full of natural rewards and punishments. No need to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  make up your own. Make the situation better *now*, and he&#39;ll <br/>\nunderstand<br/>\n the natural flow because it IS natural.<br/>\n<br/>\n what did I make up?<br/>\n<br/>\n -==-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Punishments. The natural punishment is that he feels bad for what <br/>\nhappened. Losing his video game or his favorite toy or being sent to <br/>\nhis room for time-out or yelled at for causing someone hurt---those are <br/>\npunishments imposed by someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes, I have already been learning this in my own life before this ever <br/>\ncame<br/>\n  up here. I guess that is why it made me ask Ren the question in the <br/>\nfirst<br/>\n place.. If our first instinct is to react one way, how can we be<br/>\n disappointed with ourselves for reacting according to instinct and not<br/>\n  according to our ideal, ie: a hug. I guess this is a very timely topic <br/>\nfor<br/>\n  me. Maybe it is because i have steep stairs and fall from these could <br/>\nbe<br/>\n  deadly, maybe I am misinterpreting the gravity of the potential <br/>\ninjury, but<br/>\n I honestly do think I would have yelled and I would have needed to calm<br/>\n  myself before even being able to talk to the pusher let alone hug <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  And maybe we would too. But we really work at being more mindful and <br/>\nthinking that our children are working hard at being GOOD.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes, but physical injuries might require more immediate attention and I<br/>\n would therefore do that first.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n  -And we would too. And Ren did.

It is intuitive to me to be more of a<br/>\n&gt;hands-on teacher/guide for my kiddos. We use curriculums, some of which we<br/>\n&gt;really, really enjoy, others of which we enjoy somewhat less but feel they<br/>\n&gt;will provide benefit in the long run, ex: ds/8 and reading/writing.<br/>\n&gt;Actually, I have found him many times now hidden under the blankets at night<br/>\n&gt;with a flashlight reading his favorite books, this is a real change for him<br/>\n&gt;and I attribute it to my perseverance in trying all kinds of new books until<br/>\n&gt;I found some that he could latch onto and find a liking for. I am confident<br/>\n&gt;if I had left it up to him totally he would still be thinking he &quot;hates&quot;<br/>\n&gt;reading. Now he tells me, &quot;wow, Mom you were right. Books are soo cool. I<br/>\n&gt;hope I live long enough to read most of them!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds to me like things have been working out nicely for you and <br/>\nyour young&#39;uns with your current homeschooling regimen.  I&#39;m just <br/>\ncurious to know (which, of course, you certainly don&#39;t have to <br/>\nanswer) what&#39;s moving you to check out an unschooling basics list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt; Creating artificial rewards and punishments<br/>\n </span></blockquote>feels counterintuitive to me in our unschooling, life-learning world. Ya<br/>\nknow?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the reason I said that was this, and I&#39;ll try to be brief <br/>\n(&#39;cause I&#39;m *supposed* to be working!).  Folks who unschool glean <br/>\nlearning from the things they do in the real world.  My son loves to <br/>\nplay Yu-Gi-Oh duels, and he has learned to read and to calculate from <br/>\ndoing this and other things, too.  He has learned and is learning to <br/>\nread and write because it&#39;s required of him so he can play World of <br/>\nWarcraft.  He needs to ~ and wants to ~ know how to manage his money <br/>\nso he can get the things he wants.  He gains musical (mathematical) <br/>\nconcepts because he likes to play the guitar.  He mastered telling <br/>\ntime because it became important to him to know what time it was so <br/>\nhe wouldn&#39;t miss a favorite TV show or he wanted to know how long <br/>\nbefore a friend was coming over.  In the same way that my son learns <br/>\nthese things from doing what he loves and living his real life rather <br/>\nthan having lessons shoved down his throat (and I&#39;m not implying that <br/>\n*you* shove lessons down your kids&#39; throats), he learns about life by <br/>\nliving it and interacting with other folks in a real way.  Of course, <br/>\nI am with him through all this and we talk a lot about what goes on, <br/>\nhis impressions, my impressions, what&#39;s important, what&#39;s not, all <br/>\nkinds of things that run the gamut from the mundane to the mystical <br/>\n(and, I&#39;m not saying that only unschoolers do this, by the way; I&#39;m <br/>\nsure you probably talk to your kids like this, too).  Anyway, I see <br/>\npunishments and rewards as contrived much in the same way that math <br/>\nworksheets and vocabulary/spelling lists are contrived.  I just <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t bring myself to impose punishments on him believing what I believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, my son, now 11 years old, is very polite, very <br/>\nconcerned about doing the right thing in the world, has no problems <br/>\ntaking responsibility for what he does, is very, very honest with me, <br/>\nand is very loving and joyful.  He knows a lot of more conventionally <br/>\nparented kids, and he is very aware that his life is quite different <br/>\nfrom those of other kids he knows.  He expresses a great deal of <br/>\ngratitude to me and to his dad.  He&#39;s not perfect, but neither am I, <br/>\nof course, and we are both learning all the time together.  He&#39;s also <br/>\naware that not being perfect (he actually said this to me recently) <br/>\nis a good position to be in because making mistakes is a great way to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnway, I don&#39;t know if that clears things up or muddles them up more, <br/>\nbut I&#39;m tired and I really should be working now.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marji<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140240070,"authorName":"eriksmama2001","from":"&quot;eriksmama2001&quot; &lt;scubamama@...&gt;","profile":"eriksmama2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Breaking news:","postDate":"1151632015","msgId":15082,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU4MXZxZis3ZnIxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwNjI5MjE1OC5rNVRMd0ZoYzAwNzEzMkBtcy1zbXRwLTA1LnRhbXBhYmF5LnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":15080,"nextInTopic":15083,"prevInTime":15081,"nextInTime":15083,"topicId":15002,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... being an unschooler, but it does raise a few questions for me. ... ***Nope.

Plenty of times people do NOT react<br/>\nwith a hug first, but also do NOT react with ranting or railing.  That was<br/>\nmy point.  In fact, most times I do not react first with ranting or railing<br/>\nand many times in fact a hug is involved AFTERWARD.  In a situation such as<br/>\nthis I honestly could imagine myself ranting and railing just as Ren said<br/>\nshe did.  That was why my whole question came up in the first place.. Why<br/>\nwould we EXPECT ourselves to instinctively react with a hug?  (please do not<br/>\nfeel as if you need to re-explain this concept, I think I&#39;ve gotten it now,<br/>\nI am just re-listing her for clarification&#39;s sake as some people seem to<br/>\nthink I am making hypocritical statements). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;That&#39;s very typical parenting behavior---some would call it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>instinctive. :-(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAn instinct is something you do without deliberating.  So for me in that<br/>\ntype of a case and for Ren in that one example and for many others all the<br/>\ntime it is called instinctive because it is.  I am not saying it is a happy<br/>\nthing, or something to be proud of, or even something that can NEVER be<br/>\nchanged.  I am just arguing the fact that it is instinct.  Protect the weak,<br/>\ndefend the underdog, prosecute the perpetrator.  You do not have to agree<br/>\nwith me, I am only basing this on my realm of experience and do not claim<br/>\nfor it to be word of fact for all folks.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We&#39;d just like for you to look at it in a different way.

I would expect they<br/>\nwould apologize to the one they hurt just as I apologized to them for my<br/>\nranting (if I did indeed rant at that instance) and I would then be hit with<br/>\nan INSTICT to hug.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hugs FIRST!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I have NO PROBLEM with this.

Marji has given me<br/>\nthe best idea to consider thus far in that the more we consciously decide to<br/>\nreact in ta certain way (ex: hugs first) then the more possible it is that<br/>\nthis will EVENTUALLY become our typical response.  I see it as a habituated<br/>\nresponse, not necessarily instinctive.. Then again, why is my instinctive<br/>\nreaction the way it is now?  Is it truly all instinct or might be more<br/>\nrealistic to consider I have been habituated to react this way in the first<br/>\nplace..

Once it was clear it<br/>\nwas a total accident that occurred whilst rough housing I would have<br/>\nreminded him to cool his jets a little and apologize to the one he<br/>\naccidentally hurt.  That&#39;s it, no ranting, no railing and maybe no hugging<br/>\neven.  Of course if he was frightened enough by something to come running to<br/>\nme for a hug or security I would have happily provided that too, and then<br/>\nfollowed up with clarification, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;He got consoled, he avoided Ben for an hour or so! &lt;G&gt;, and everything <br/>\n </span></blockquote>was fine in a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhy did he need consolation? I want to make sure I understand. And as far as<br/>\navoiding Ben for an hour, I am sorry but I don&#39;t dig that.

It&#39;ll be better for your <br/>\nrelationship!<br/>\n<br/>\nsee, I think that it is ok to have bad moments because you have reasons,<br/>\n(hungry, tired, ill, bad day, etc.) but I really think it is unfair to treat<br/>\nothers unkindly because of it.  I am more apt to accept this sort of thing<br/>\nfrom a toddler or young child who is still learning but as they get older I<br/>\nhave a harder time with it.  For example, it would have been harder for me<br/>\nto just go and hug my ds/8 or my dd/12 if they were the ones swatting at<br/>\neach other, I would have been like, &quot;um, excuse me.  I see that you are<br/>\ntired and in disagreement but it is NOT ok to put your hands on one another&quot;<br/>\netc.  Does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly, I must say I really appreciate the time you and others have taken to<br/>\nenlighten me.

Regardless of  <br/>\nwho the offender is, even one of your own children, if your child is  <br/>\nhurt you want to protect them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur daughter Breanna has autism.

The worst thing that could happen  <br/>\nto her, if she hurts someone, is for someone&#39;s mom to come running up  <br/>\nand yelling. Because at that point, Bre has lost focus on what just  <br/>\nhappened, and now her focus is totally on the person yelling at her.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s already emotionally unstable, and someone is hurting HER  <br/>\naurally, emotionally, etc. There is no chance that we can revisit  <br/>\nwhat just happened and replay it with a better ending. She has  <br/>\nlearned nothing from the situation, except that you cannot trust the  <br/>\nworld. To her it seemed reasonable at the time. To have someone with  <br/>\nan irrational (to her) response come up, completely negates any  <br/>\nlearning she has done on how to treat people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe longer we live with her, the more I see this play out in children  <br/>\nwho do NOT have disabilities.

I do agree that<br/>\nmaking the choice to shove her in the first place was a mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Second, if you think back to when you were little, you probably made <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a lot of mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh, still do!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Some were inconsequential and some may have been <br/>\n </span></blockquote>serious.

No wonder it is taking all<br/>\nthis time, and offering a hug following a poor choice probably would have<br/>\nbeen a few more years off! LOL.  Seriously, I would like to hear the tape. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Compassion is not a reward.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i agree but it is still hard for me to be instinctively compassionate<br/>\ntowards someone who has been unkind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The trick is to let go of the concepts <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of &quot;rewards&quot; and &quot;punishments.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut life is both rewarding and punishing.

But, the more you make the choice to be more <br/>\n </span></blockquote>compassionate in your responses, the closer you move to having <br/>\ncompassion be your instinctual response.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree and I work at this daily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It helps to acknowledge that every experience is one that we all~wee <br/>\n </span></blockquote>ones and old ones~can learn and grow from.<br/>\n<br/>\nAcknowledged<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Jalen had a powerful <br/>\n </span></blockquote>learning experience today, and because he didn&#39;t have to waste his <br/>\ntime and energy feeling mean and defensive and angry at the world, he <br/>\nwill be able to absorb it and grow from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nyes, I agree with this but here is a totally honest account of how I would<br/>\nlikely have reacted had this happened in my house today:<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have ranted and railed (I am not proud to admit this, but I am being<br/>\nhonest) at the pusher and given very disapproving looks.  I would have sent<br/>\nthem off to think about what they had done and I would have tended to the<br/>\ninjured child.  After I had time to calm down I would have gone to the<br/>\npusher and done my best to talk calmly.  I would have apologized for my<br/>\npanicked outburst and explained I still need work at controlling my<br/>\ninstinctive reactions.  I would have asked them about their choice and if<br/>\nthey felt they would have done anything differently next time.  When this<br/>\nlittle &quot;talk&quot; was over I would have hugged them then and asked them to<br/>\nplease apologize to their sibling.  I am sharing this candid response to<br/>\nshow that my first reaction would not be to run over and hug the pusher.  I<br/>\nwould feel quite angry at the choice he made and I would have a hard time<br/>\nshowing any compassion until I calmed down and made sure the one at the<br/>\nbottom of the stairs was ok.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I hope that helps a little.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it helps a lot, actually.  After reading your email and thinking more about<br/>\nthis I tried it out.  My ds/4 was in a very uncharacteristically angry mood.<br/>\nHe was pouting and swatting at his siblings over a movie choice or something<br/>\n(ie: he was just over-tired).  I went over to him and held his swatting arms<br/>\ndown as I hugged him.  At first he tried to swat at me twice.  I said<br/>\nsomething like, &quot;please don&#39;t swat at mama.  Please let me hug you&quot; and he<br/>\nimmediately melted into me.  He had a good cry and big long hug and then he<br/>\nlifted his head to look at me and said, &quot;mama please can I have a snack?&quot; so<br/>\nhe was tired and hungry!  Not a good combo.  I was pleased how the hug<br/>\nworked.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachell <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Breaking news:","postDate":"1151526526","msgId":15039,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJBRDA2RTU4LTA4NDQtNEVBRC1CRkUwLThFMzc1RDJCRTkxQkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGQ3LjNhZWNiMTllLjMxZDNlOTY5QGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGQ3LjNhZWNiMTllLjMxZDNlOTY5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15031,"nextInTopic":15063,"prevInTime":15038,"nextInTime":15040,"topicId":15002,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I found the only way to help<br/>\nher was just to hold her and hold her and hold her until she finally<br/>\ncould calm down.  At the beginning it was hard because I truly was<br/>\nhaving to force myself to hold/hug her after she had made a huge mess,<br/>\nbroken something, or been physically aggressive towards someone.  I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t happy with her during those periods because she wasn&#39;t behaving<br/>\nwell.  But I held her anyway.  Sometimes she would fight me at the<br/>\nbeginning because she didn&#39;t want me to hold her.  I ended up with<br/>\nmany bruises and scratches (and once a pair of broken glasses) from<br/>\nholding her.

The trick is to let go of the concepts <br/>\nof &quot;rewards&quot; and &quot;punishments.&quot;  Jalen wasn&#39;t being rewarded; he <br/>\nneeded a hug right then, and Ren was able to find the compassion <br/>\nwithin herself to give Jalen what he needed.  Jalen needed that hug <br/>\njust as much as Sierra did.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I find it hard to instinctively reward a poor, unkind<br/>\n&gt;choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can understand that.  But, the more you make the choice to be more <br/>\ncompassionate in your responses, the closer you move to having <br/>\ncompassion be your instinctual response.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to acknowledge that every experience is one that we all~wee <br/>\nones and old ones~can learn and grow from.  Jalen had a powerful <br/>\nlearning experience today, and because he didn&#39;t have to waste his <br/>\ntime and energy feeling mean and defensive and angry at the world, he <br/>\nwill be able to absorb it and grow from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompassionately yours,<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":88692815,"authorName":"Rachell Skerlec","from":"&quot;Rachell Skerlec&quot; &lt;panacea@...&gt;","profile":"holyquest","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Breaking news:","postDate":"1151445293","msgId":15012,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNjI3MjE1NC5rNVJMc2ppYzAwOTgwOUBtcy1zbXRwLTA0LnRhbXBhYmF5LnJyLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGU3czY3ZStoNnVoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15002,"nextInTopic":15015,"prevInTime":15011,"nextInTime":15013,"topicId":15002,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Forgive me Ren, but I do not understand how a child can shove another child down the stairs and you expect your first instinct to be a hug.
