We do not want<br/>\nto be treating children who don&#39;t need our help. IT&#39;s a waste of<br/>\neveryone&#39;s time and money. I evaluate and screen many children for<br/>\nwhom I do not recommend services. I may recommend monitoring or<br/>\nre-evaluation in 6-12 months to be sure they are developing, if the<br/>\nfamily would like to keep an eye on it.  We have to document clear<br/>\ndelays or impairments in order for the insurance companies to pay for<br/>\ntreatment. Most companies require standardized norms showing a delay<br/>\nand many require additional confirmation that it is not simply a<br/>\ndevelopmental delay (late talker) but a true impairment, as they will<br/>\nnot pay for simple delays. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, most parents who are seeking an evaluation are truly concerned<br/>\n(not just mildly) and want some help. We therefore assume the family<br/>\nwants services if the results show the child is having significant<br/>\ndifficulties.  I personally give the families a variety of options<br/>\n(monitoring, re-evaluation, treatment sessions, consultations so the<br/>\nparent can learn the tools to help the child), but 95% choose the<br/>\ntreatment sessions. Will the majority of children catch up on their<br/>\nown? Yes - about 85% for language problems and 60% for speech<br/>\nproblems. But we don&#39;t know which children these are and most parents<br/>\nare not willing to take the chance of waiting 2+ years to find out.<br/>\nThat&#39;s a long time when you are talking about serious speech and<br/>\nlanguage disorders - the ones that require years (5+ yrs) to resolve<br/>\nwith treatment and rarely resolve without treatment. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlison (who has said enough on this subject on the public list.

So I took him for a speech evaluation with a speech therapist and they recommended therapy (big surprise, they don&#39;t get paid if they don&#39;t recommend such, but I digress, and the evaluation cost $150). Well.... They didn&#39;t have any openings for S.T. untill January (we did the evaluation back in Sept) and, low and behold, for the last few months, gradually, my son&#39;s speech has improved to such a degree that I am wondering if it&#39;s a waste of time/money to take him to the S.T. at all... I plan to take him at least a few times, since my husband says it might help his with his problems in prounouncing words correctly where he still has trouble... But my point is, due to my personal experience in this matter, I know how your anxiety can get the best of you, but I have<br/>\n begun to think that this, like most learning, is something that kids &#39;get&#39; in their own time and where &#39;problems&#39; come up is when we have &#39;expectations&#39; based on the &#39;cookie cutter child developement books&#39; and where they &#39;should&#39; be. I think your daughter sounds pretty advanced really, if she&#39;s able to articulate the idea that &#39;she can&#39;t wait till she&#39;s older and can talk like her sister&#39;, that&#39;s a pretty broad idea that she can&#39;t have gotten across without having pretty good working knowledge and usage of language. So... My advice is to stop worrying yourself and you&#39;ll be surprised in six months how well she speaks, I bet. ;)<br/>\n  Smiles,<br/>\n   Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nEveryone is raving about the all-new Yahoo!

The thing that concerns me about<br/>\nyour post is that your dd is getting frustrated.

However, your dd is still a few months<br/>\naway from that and it is amazing the difference a few months makes.<br/>\nYou can wait a little bit to see what happens.  Things that might help<br/>\nin the mean time is to spend extra time really listening to her speech<br/>\nto find some patterns that might help you with the unfamiliar words.<br/>\nFor example, you might realize that she uses a w or a b for all &#39;f&#39;<br/>\nsounds. Or you might notice that she is omitting the middle sounds in<br/>\nher words (wa-er for water) or an entire syllable: bi-cle for bicycle.<br/>\nOnce you know what&#39;s happening, your brain will be better able to<br/>\ninterpret and you can also start emphasizing the correct patterns in<br/>\nyour speech (not asking her to correct, just giving her the right model). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf she is still having alot of trouble in a few months, then I would<br/>\nsay it&#39;s worth getting an evaluation so that you know her how to help<br/>\nher better (ex., emphasizing age level sounds, working on segmenting<br/>\nwords so she understands to say all her syllables). But if she is<br/>\nreally getting upset because people don&#39;t understand her, it may be<br/>\nworth getting the evaluation now. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have more questions, feel free to email me... <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, if she wasn&#39;t frustrated, I would say leave it alone for now.<br/>\nMost speech problems will eventually resolve on their own.

Being understandable comes later for a lot of kids.  Is it maybe that your daughter was just an earlier talker, or more adept at this age, so it feels like your younger daughter may be behind?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My oldest spoke early, and was very verbal well by the time he was two.  When the second came along and wasn&#39;t talking much by two, I started to worry that maybe he was behind.  When I looked around at other kids his age, and did a bit of reading, what I found was that older ds had been precocious verbally.  I realized, too, that younger dd already had other skills -- physical ones -- that older dd hadn&#39;t had at 2.  It&#39;s just that older dd was verbally precocious, where the younger two turned out to be physically precocious.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Since your daughter is frustrated at not being able to make herself understood, come up with way to help her.  Is comfortable with having her older sister translate?  Andy was Dan&#39;s translator for a long time -- still is some days, since Dan still has trouble with some words in particular.  And some words just come late, too.  My oldest was 6 before he managed to say helicopter -- for years it was heppydocker (which I thought was very cute).  We all just continued to say helicopter the right way. Then one day, he said helicopter, and he was so excited!  He yelled &quot;I said it -- I said helicopter!&quot;  I realized then that he&#39;d been very trying to get it right.  He knew it wasn&#39;t coming out right but just hadn&#39;t been able to make it happen until that moment.  Even today, I can&#39;t see a helicopter without thinking heppidocker and remembering how excited he was the day he finally got it right!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Also, sometimes we get so wrapped up in looking for one specific thing that we don&#39;t see the other things going on.  Maybe the reason you&#39;re not hearing progress in speech is because she&#39;s tackling other development things.  Two is a busy age, lots of growing and physical skills to master -- dressing herself, pottying, teething, ever-changing sleep needs.  The verbal skills will come. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Mom to<br/>\n  Will (almost 22!)
