I got him off a bloke who was nasty to him when he was a year old. He gave me 13 years of devotion and  in the end had to be put down cos of inoperable cancer.  2 years ago I found another  G.S - this time a girl. She was another one no one wanted. Terrified of men and tried too hard to please.  I watch her play fighting with dh and it is hard to remember how scared she was of him when she first came home.  She follows me everywhere and would die for me. Another good girl. The words mean a tail thumping wag which includes her whole behind. I know in the scheme of things her life is short but she is happy and I am so pleased she is here.

She was about 7 1/2 years old.  She was part<br/>\nAustralian Shepherd and part something else.  She was a &quot;Good Girl&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose were the words of praise I used for her when she did what I<br/>\nwanted her to, but they were true in a much deeper sense as well.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t say them nearly enough.  She lived for a kind word or a gentle<br/>\nhand from anyone in the family.  She was gentle as dogs go.  She loved<br/>\nto run.  She never bit me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got her from the Humane Society when she was about a year old.  She<br/>\nhad been left there by her previous owners.  They left her because<br/>\nthey were expecting their first baby and didn&#39;t want to be troubled<br/>\nwith a dog as well.  They said she wasn&#39;t housebroken, but she didn&#39;t<br/>\ngive us any troubles.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t know it, but when we got her, she was pregnant.  She lost<br/>\nthe puppies shortly after we found she was carrying.  We only found<br/>\nout at all because we tried to have her spayed.  The first time we<br/>\ntook her in, they said she was anemic.  The second time, they figured<br/>\nout why.  The place we were staying at wouldn&#39;t allow puppies, so we<br/>\nwere afraid we were going to have to take her back.  We had called<br/>\njust about everyone we knew and finally found a stranger who would<br/>\ntake her in until she had the puppies and weaned them.  She miscarried<br/>\nthe next day.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhen we first walked her, before she was trained, she would literally<br/>\nspin on her leash.  She started off running back and forth as far as<br/>\nit would let her, but then would get so excited that she didn&#39;t bother<br/>\nwith the straight part.  She ran in a tight turn not much bigger than<br/>\nshe was - so fast she would tear up the ground - at times leaning so<br/>\nfar into the turn, she looked like she was almost laying down - other<br/>\ntimes spinning so fast, she only looked like she was touching the<br/>\nground at all for convienience.  She loved to run.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while, we were not sure if she could bark.  She was a very timid<br/>\ndog and seemed to be shy around everyone.  She was almost pathetically<br/>\neager to please.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was with us through almost twenty moves, the births of both our<br/>\nchildren, several job changes and pretty much every important event in<br/>\nour lives.  She was joyous when we were happy, supportive when we were<br/>\ndown.  She was a good girl.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I said it to her more often.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5678,"nextTopicId":5692}}
