Usually, if a group needs to have a planning meeting, it&#39;s all about structured activities. That wouldn&#39;t be so bad if it was just fun outings being planned, but usually it&#39;s lessonish/schoolish kind of stuff...but not always.<br/>\nThe key for me, would be what kind of group it was.<br/>\nOur group gets together weekly and we never have planning meetings. We don&#39;t really need them seeing as we&#39;re very relaxed. I would love to get together with some of the adults once in a while, just to chat without distractions, but several of us are working outside the home, so we don&#39;t want to spend time away from our families for something other than work.<br/>\nFind out what the meetings are about. If it&#39;s all curriculum oriented, you probably won&#39;t like it. If they&#39;re just planning some fun outings, it might work for an unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3323,"nextTopicId":3343}}
