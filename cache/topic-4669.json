More than 17 years ago, I had a brain  <br/>\ntumor...very scary and life changing.<br/>\nWhen I first went for a walk outside when I got home from the hospital, I  <br/>\nwas so amazed that the sky was so blue.  I promised myself to live my life  <br/>\ntaking time to notice the sky every day. That become such a part of me that I do  <br/>\njust that.  It grounds me and reminds me that I am so very lucky to have  had <br/>\nall these years to see the sky, and have my children and be present to watch  <br/>\nthem as they grow.<br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooling has been much the same process for me only not so abrupt.   Once <br/>\nI got it, it was like seeing the sky for the first time.  I would  never go <br/>\nback to the way I lived my life before my illness.  I&#39;d never go  back to my <br/>\nlife before I &quot;got&quot; unschooling.<br/>\n <br/>\nGail<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128307542,"authorName":"Earthmomma67@aol.com","from":"Earthmomma67@...","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Digest Number 312","postDate":"1105628719","msgId":4669,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJmLjRlYzliODYyLjJmMTdlODJmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4684,"prevInTime":4668,"nextInTime":4670,"topicId":4669,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/13/05 9:53:20 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...
