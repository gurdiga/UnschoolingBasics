If you get <br/>\nto clean or cook, it&#39;s a bonus.  I know that sounds lame, but if you <br/>\naccept that, it will be easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can afford to hire a nice older lady or teen to come in and <br/>\nplay mothers helper once a week, DO IT. Let them cook or clean while <br/>\nyou play with the kids, OR let them distract the kids while you <br/>\ncatch up. It&#39;s so worth the money. I didn&#39;t get to do this often, <br/>\nbut those rare times were lovely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always suggest keeping a stash of dollar store toys, new snacks, <br/>\nany interesting items that are different than what you already own.<br/>\nPull those out when you really are longing to see your counters <br/>\nagain, or when the kids are cranky and you need to re-focus the <br/>\nenergy.  PLAYDOUGH! I can&#39;t say enough good about playdough. When <br/>\nthe playdough was out, that one area of the house was getting <br/>\ntrashed but I could run around and pick up some other stuff. I don&#39;t <br/>\ncare for many baby contraptions, but I DID love having a high chair <br/>\nfor wee babsy art projects. Jalen never had one, but it might have <br/>\nbeen nice for the playdough moments.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a new game I&#39;ve discovered that allows me to clean while <br/>\nplaying with Jalen and Sierra...Hide-n-seek.  I LOVE being the one <br/>\nto count, because the entire time I&#39;m looking for them, I&#39;m picking <br/>\nstuff up. It&#39;s great. They are happily playing and I actually get <br/>\nsomething done.<br/>\nIt&#39;s easier for us now, with mostly older kids in the house. <br/>\nJust remember, when you&#39;re in the midst of baby/toddler stuff, it <br/>\nfeels like it&#39;s going to be forever.<br/>\nYou&#39;ll be hugging big, tall teens soon and all the mess and chaos of <br/>\nthe younger years will be forgotten and mostly what you&#39;ll remember <br/>\nis the happy smiles and fun projects and cuddly moments.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and going for drives. I know you don&#39;t get housework done, but a <br/>\nlong, exploratory drive is a great way to keep everyone happy and <br/>\nspark new connections.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7948,"nextTopicId":7942}}
