The reason for glasses now is that his vision can most likely be corrected with just lenses, and possibly vision therapy in a year or two. And that it will stay corrected once it is. Whereas if he waits until he&#39;s an adult, he can attain 3-d (you probably could, too if you wanted to. Read &quot;Fixing My Gaze by Sue Barry. She is a patient of my son&#39;s eye dr.) but it will most likely not be permanent. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe isn&#39;t wearing them right now, but has worn them some today. The main reason he gives  is that they don&#39;t help him see better. But that&#39;s not the point, they are meant to keep his right eye straight. Otherwise his vision is fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I&#39;m doing is just offering them and surprisingly he took them and put them on himself this morning. But just refused to put them back on.

It might help to do some extra research on your own and find out how much he really &quot;needs&quot; to wear them - and then step back and see if he&#39;ll average out to the same amount of time in typical unschooling fashion (a whole day here and there instead of &quot;four hours a day five days a week&quot;). <br/>\n<br/>\nIts also worth researching any kinds of physical therapy - just glancing through links there seems to be some that can help and not just young children, so the matter may not be as time-sensitive as doctors are leading you to think. It may be something you can incorporate into your regular play, even!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":153200361,"authorName":"~*~Tracy Austin","from":"&quot;~*~Tracy Austin&quot; &lt;webinfusion@...&gt;","profile":"tracyaustin30","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Glasses and my 4 y/o ds","postDate":"1260118268","msgId":42354,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCRTgwNjQyNjUwNzRDOEM5NjVFNTk4NDMwM0ZFMjBEQEF1c3RpbkJ1c2luZXNzPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhmZ2V1cytkcGR1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhmZ2V1cytkcGR1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42353,"nextInTopic":42358,"prevInTime":42353,"nextInTime":42355,"topicId":42348,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Colleen, Just knowing my ds, unfortunately I don t think he would go for me sticking something in his eyes everyday....
