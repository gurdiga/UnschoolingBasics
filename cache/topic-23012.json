I know she could go so far, if she would<br/>\njust go! How do I get her started learning on her own? I have borrowed<br/>\nThe Teenage Liberation Handbook from the library and I have just<br/>\nstarted reading it. I would like her to read it as well, but I am not<br/>\nsure how to approach it. If she feels it is forced, she will<br/>\nhalf-heartedly read it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI HIGHLY recommend a conference. She would be on board almost <br/>\nimmediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut she needs *healing* first! She needs to &quot;veg out&quot; for a few months. <br/>\nTo get her head together.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore she can rediscover learning, she&#39;ll have to do nothing for a <br/>\nwhile. She won&#39;t actually *BE* doing nothing. It&#39;ll just look that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll be healing and finding out about what makes her tick. *YOU* just <br/>\nhave to be patient. Very, very patient. Trust that she&#39;s doing what&#39;s <br/>\nneeded. It will probably look like sleeping, talking on the phone, and <br/>\nwatching TV. But it will soon (and certainly NOT soon enough!) start <br/>\nlooking like something---like gardening or drawing or sewing or <br/>\nskateboarding---or something interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can read the book TO her. I read the TLH to Cameron when he was <br/>\ndeschooling. He really doesn&#39;t remember much---if anything. But he <br/>\nremembers talking about it. And now he&#39;s been to Grace&#39;s camps, so he <br/>\nknows her personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will be the most painful period for *you* because it is! Watching <br/>\nyour child do nothing. It sucks. But it&#39;s necessary for the healing to <br/>\ntake place. And the more patient you are, the quicker it&#39;ll happen!<br/>\n<br/>\nPatience. Patience. Patience!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh---also go to or rent lots and lots of movies. Eat out at or fix <br/>\nethnic food.

We<br/>\nmade a miserable attempt at unschooling when we started.<br/>\nUnfortunately, we were socializing with homeschoolers that were very<br/>\nschool-at-home and I gave in. For the next couple of years we used an<br/>\neclectic approach with mixed results. This last year, we purchased a<br/>\ncurriculum. We have been muddling through it, but both my daughter and<br/>\nI want something more. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody have suggestions? I know she could go so far, if she would<br/>\njust go! How do I get her started learning on her own? I have borrowed<br/>\nThe Teenage Liberation Handbook from the library and I have just<br/>\nstarted reading it. I would like her to read it as well, but I am not<br/>\nsure how to approach it. If she feels it is forced, she will<br/>\nhalf-heartedly read it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you everyone in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nKristi N.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23022,"nextTopicId":22986}}
