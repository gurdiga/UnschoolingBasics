We will offically move July 1st! <br/>\n<br/>\nI have talked with ds and he has let me know what does and doesn&#39;t<br/>\nbother him. We have created a couple of code words he can remember<br/>\nthat let me know he wants me to step in if he is trying to communicate<br/>\nwith these kids and they are not respecting his boundaries. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had 2 incidents with one of the kids that has left ds<br/>\nunderstanding this it not a trustyworthy child and he has asked me to<br/>\nlet this child know he is unwelcome inside our home. I have done so. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have talked and talked about stuff and I think we have deepened the<br/>\nconnection and trust between ds and myself. That feels good. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have talked with a couple of the kids one on one and to the side<br/>\naway from other kids. I have tried to connect with them and let them<br/>\nknow I think they are good kids who sometimes make decisions that<br/>\ndon&#39;t work out the best for them. I told them I am happy to listen if<br/>\nthey want to bounce ideas off me and that they are welcome to play if<br/>\nthey are able to be respectful of people who are here. Things have<br/>\nbeen somewhat better. <br/>\n<br/>\nStaying away from home as much as possible is an interesting<br/>\nchallenge. We are trying to find ways to do that without letting<br/>\nthings get out of control at home and without spending more money than<br/>\nwe have avaialble. We have had some good ideas and are trying new<br/>\nthings out. It will be a moot point when we get to the new house I<br/>\nhope. Or at least the excitement of a new place will carry us for a<br/>\nwhile. Plus ds understands we will be able to invite folks to come<br/>\nplay at our house with much less fuss than we can right now.

I have learned thru life but<br/>\nmostly my hubby that there are many varieties of humor. My husband finds<br/>\nwhat I call stupid humor the funniest. Stuff like Mask, Ace Ventura and Dumb<br/>\nand Dumber are the first to come to mind. I prefer ironic and slapstick<br/>\nhumor. There is no surprise then that our children love the oddest jokes and<br/>\na variety of humor. My oldest son though is showing a preference for stupid<br/>\nhumor. The children will wear out a joke until the funniest is just not<br/>\nfunny anymore but if our reaction (positive or negative) is strong enough -<br/>\nthey will do it just for the reaction of it. I will laugh at even the<br/>\nweakest joke the first time and maybe even the second - after I say &quot;I think<br/>\nI heard that one before.&quot; or &quot;That was funny the first time - got anything<br/>\nnew?&quot; I try to only give strong reactions to things I want to see again.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son&#39;s current thing is trying to scare me.

There is<br/>\nsomething he does that just annoys me, and I&#39;m not sure how/if to change my<br/>\nreaction. He&#39;ll say something that&#39;s not true to get some kind of reaction,<br/>\nand then say he was just kidding. To me, kidding is joking, or saying<br/>\nsomething amusing. Kidding is not just lying and then saying you were<br/>\nlying. His dad does it too, and I had a boyfriend as a teen who did it, and<br/>\nI broke up with him because of it lol. I wonder if it&#39;s a common male<br/>\nthing? <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example, night before last there was a bird stuck in our vent. We<br/>\nopened it up and shut the bathroom door hoping it would be able to escape.<br/>\nYesterday he came up and said, &quot;Mom, the bird came out!&quot; I said, &quot;It<br/>\ndid?!?&quot; and he said, &quot;Just kidding!&quot; wth? It&#39;s been getting more and more<br/>\nfrequent lately. My reaction is usually something like rolling my eyes,<br/>\npointing at that it was not funny so not really kidding, or telling him that<br/>\nit annoys me when he does that. I don&#39;t particularly like my reaction, but<br/>\nI also don&#39;t want to pretend I think it&#39;s funny or cool when I don&#39;t. Also,<br/>\nI think he gets positive feedback for it from his dad and maybe my 17 yo, so<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I necessarily need to add to that. Is it ok to tell him it<br/>\nannoys me, or is it a personality trait I am rejecting or something?<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244317154,"authorName":"swissarmy_wife","from":"&quot;swissarmy_wife&quot; &lt;heatherbean@...&gt;","profile":"swissarmy_wife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: How do I stop being annoyed by this?","postDate":"1210088187","msgId":32426,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ2cHR0citvZHV1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEM0NDVDMzhBLkRFMjglcXVlYW5hQGdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":32422,"nextInTopic":32430,"prevInTime":32425,"nextInTime":32427,"topicId":32322,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My guess is you don t like being tricked.

First, what a emotional situation to be in. The most important thing to me would be to know how your son is feeling about all of these things. What does he say when his &quot;friend&quot; almost sits on him or cranes his neck to watch him go into the bathroom. *I do have to add here that my dd is almost five and would follow anyone into the bathroom if I let her. Her friends are more private than she is so far. Right now she doesn&#39;t see it as a private place, she just wants to be with her friends. So the other boy may not be invading privacy in his mind. It also might not bother your son. When I was younger my friends and I followed each other to keep talking for years, lol!<br/>\nThe other thing I thought of while reading, is WOW these other children *especially the little boy that watches XXX movies etc, is reaching out for help. All of his bullying and telling about XXX things, is him just begging for someone to help him understand. As confusing as it is for YOUR son (who of course is your MAIN concern and should remain there) just think of how confused and torn this little boy is. I am willing to bet your presence is helpful to this boy as difficult as it is for you. <br/>\nI am assuming that his parents aren&#39;t willing to talk but if they are just out of the loop, maybe you could explain some of the things that are going on to them? Could you talk to someone else that might be able to help the boy? <br/>\nMy only advice is to NEVER leave your son out there alone. He needs your help to navigate through this. If you haven&#39;t already, find out how he feels about all of these things that you have described. I would let him know how some of the situations make you feel also. I would have a few boundaries that ALL of the kids are aware of. Of course you should set those with your son&#39;s help, but my main one (and maybe only one) would be NO FIGHTING/ hurting each other on purpose. For many obvious reasons, but also because if someone gets hurt on your property under your supervision, YOU could get in trouble.<br/>\nI hope this helps and I hope you are able to move soon for your own sanity!! My neighborhood has some unruly children also that drive me crazy. :) I just remind myself that they are children and it is the parents that have molded them this way. They don&#39;t lead the same loving life our children do :(!!<br/>\nJessica<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: venting about creepy neighborhood kids","postDate":"1209829220","msgId":32342,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ2aTExNCs5cmlxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ2ZmNkYis1aWIzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32325,"nextInTopic":32348,"prevInTime":32341,"nextInTime":32343,"topicId":32322,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... with ...

I feel like I have made progress.. I didn&#39;t say anything<br/>\nwhen ds chose to eat a handful of jolly ranchers rather than the awesome<br/>\nchicken I cooked for dinner. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI need to vent and blow off some steam, hopefully get some perspective<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway. there are a lot of children in our neighborhood that give me the<br/>\ncreeps. They have no sense of respecting boundaries, they act rude, pushy,<br/>\ndemanding, etc. I have spent a LOT of time being present out there, letting<br/>\nthem know how things work in our yard. and coming down to asking them to<br/>\nleave when things get beyond what I can deal with. (Fights mainly). I seem<br/>\nto be doing something right because when things go wrong, the kids come<br/>\nknock on my door even if ds isn&#39;t even out there playing and rather than<br/>\ngoing to their own homes.. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, there are some kids who really seem to push the limits. talk about<br/>\nanal sex, masturbation, insults using sexual terms and the like. DS (9 yo)<br/>\nthankfully comes and asks me to explain about things he hears but SHIT! He<br/>\nhas not been overly exposed to things of that nature, I see no reason to<br/>\nshove him into exposure and I am PISSED. He is a child. He has a right to be<br/>\na child. When those things come into his awareness, fine, we can talk about<br/>\nthem. BUT I am PISSED that these kids are taking away his innocence. One of<br/>\nthe kids is always stirring up trouble, lying, stealing, fighting. setting<br/>\nthings on fire. he took pictures of his own brother and my ds outside<br/>\nplaying &quot;Naruto&quot; and taunted them saying he would post them on youtube or<br/>\nsome other net site in &quot;dildoland&quot; . Really? I don&#39;t even know if that<br/>\nexists but come on? WHY? And who the hell is he to post pictures of my son<br/>\non the internet without permission??????? His brother tells us all about<br/>\nthis kids exploits online, he has no sense of safety or security. He is also<br/>\n9yo and goes to XXX sites. Mum and Dad apparently have plenty of adult<br/>\nmaterial around. Fine, but sheesh, why the hell can&#39;t he keep it to himself?<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t a sharing in a safe kind of way. His behavior seems rather<br/>\npredatory to me. I talk with ds about it. A lot lately. I am at a loss<br/>\nthough. I have seen how this kids mum and dad treat the kids, they are<br/>\nverbally and emotionally abusive. I do wonder if there is physical abuse<br/>\ntoo. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI mean there is more to all of this, but this is the most recent episode.<br/>\nThere has been calling ds a :fag: because he hugged a friend, then when ds<br/>\nplugged his ears the kids were pulling his hands and taunting him until I<br/>\nheard the commotion and came out of the house. I am out there so much of the<br/>\ntime and it seems the few times I am not all hell breaks loose. Even when I<br/>\nam out there stuff happens. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to move. There is an older kid that hangs out with DS who is VERY<br/>\npushy. I talk with DS, ask how he feels, if it bothers him, offer him words<br/>\nto use when it does, and just be present when this kid is around. But this<br/>\nkid. ds says he is going in to use the bathroom and will be right back,<br/>\nother kid is pushing his face INTO my screen and craning his neck trying to<br/>\nwatch ds get to the bathroom. does this strike anyone else as CREEPY???? If<br/>\nother kids are out there trying to play with ds this kid will physically<br/>\nstand between ds and the other kids, trying to block them out. ARGH. the one<br/>\ntime I let him in the house to play (before we met his mother. I ask kids to<br/>\nwait until I meet their parents and they meet me before coming into my house<br/>\nso I don&#39;t have an angry parent pounding down my door as happened before)<br/>\nthey played a video game. We have a long sofa and two chairs, ds sat in his<br/>\nusual spot and this other kid (not to mention the same thing happened with<br/>\nanother kid!) sat practically ON him. Like most of his leg was on ds&#39;s leg.<br/>\nDS asked him to move and he did, but then moved back within like 3 minutes.<br/>\nto me that is CREEPY!!! I put the chairs in front of the tv and said I<br/>\nneeded the couch to work on my project (which was true, I just worked on it<br/>\nearlier than planned) and the boys moved to the chairs. The one boy tried to<br/>\nsit in the same chair as ds. even when ds said no. I asked ds to help me in<br/>\nthe other room for a minute and checked in with him on how he was feeling.<br/>\nhe tries to be nice but said it bothered him. I let him know it was totally<br/>\nok to tell someone else to move. I have always told him it is ok to tell<br/>\nsomeone not to touch him. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t told DS he can&#39;t play with these kids. I did say I do not feel<br/>\nsafe about him going to the houses of two of these kids. I have explained<br/>\nthat since their parents scream, curse at and hit their children and treat<br/>\nthem really disrespectfully I believe that is an unsafe situation for him to<br/>\ngo into alone. Thankfully he agrees and doesn&#39;t mind that I prefer he have<br/>\nthe kids come here to play. (And yes I KNOW they do this and in front of<br/>\nother kids as I have witnessed it) I know it is hard for him. Our many<br/>\nattempts to connect with other people have resulted in knowing lots of great<br/>\npeople who are really far away from us. We see them when we can. Most of<br/>\nthem when we go to visit it is an all day journey for us.  I am not willing<br/>\nto never be home. I like being home. I wish there were more people near to<br/>\nus with at least the ability to tolerate our differences and who aren&#39;t<br/>\nsystematically dismantling their children&#39;s spirits. Oh that is a whole<br/>\nother thing. people who talk about how awful the things were their parents<br/>\ndid to them and then proceeding to KNOWINGLY do exactly the same thing to<br/>\ntheir own kids. To the point that to be around them feels like we are being<br/>\nexposed to witness abuse. it is really gut wrenching some of this stuff I<br/>\nwitness. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs it is my domestic abilities are in serious question because I am more<br/>\nfocused on providing ds with opportunities than darning socks ;) I know the<br/>\nlaundry isn&#39;t going anywhere, the stack of papers will get filed when I get<br/>\nto it, the jeans will get patched when they get patched. etc. I would spend<br/>\na LOT more time away from home except I need to eat and sleep. I don&#39;t do<br/>\nwell on lots of prepackaged food items so I make most of our stuff. I use<br/>\nthe crock pot and cook extras to have leftovers but being away from home all<br/>\nthe time leaves me feeling disoriented and unhappy.  Really I would like to<br/>\nmove and am pushing for it, dh is just not on board with it. I am hoping<br/>\nevery day my friend comes thru with getting out of her old house and renting<br/>\nto us like she offered a year ago but I am not holding my breath. Houses in<br/>\nour $$ range are further than dh is willing to drive to work. Changing jobs<br/>\nis not really an option being active duty Air Force. though we are both<br/>\nready to say screw the retirement and have him get out at the end of this<br/>\nenlistment( would be at 17 years!). Which is a whole other thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I am just feeling overwhelmed and undersupported. I do what I can. I<br/>\nhave hobbies of my own that I can be doing while still being present outside<br/>\nwhile ds is playing with these kids to hopefully minimize incidents. I keep<br/>\nseeking out folks that have safer environments for ds to play and inviting<br/>\nkids to come play at our place that do behave well. I cherish the people ds<br/>\nenjoys playing with who might parent differently but at least are not<br/>\nscreaming at their kids! I keep the dialogue with ds open all the time. I<br/>\nlet him know he can say anything to me, he can ask me any questions and he<br/>\ncan talk to other people that will give honest info to him as well (dh, my<br/>\ndad, my older sister, my oldest nephew) without judgment, criticism or<br/>\ncensoring. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying to get this outside of myself as it feels like it is still<br/>\neating away at me. Sorry if I am kind of all over the place and to be so<br/>\nlong winded. There is so much going on here, I am sure much of it is getting<br/>\nskipped over, I am trying to be more concise. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa R<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33064,"nextTopicId":33012}}
