Lower bowels bloated, rumbling and bubbling, <br/>\ndiscomfort, gas, diarrhea, cramping are typical. Only about 25 percent <br/>\nof people who self-diagnose with lactose intolerance really do have it. <br/>\nAnd it isn&#39;t all-or-nothing - lots of people can handle a little milk, <br/>\nand not a lot. There are reliable tests for lactose intolerance - but <br/>\nmost doctors don&#39;t bother with them. If you really truly want to know - <br/>\ndo the hydrogen breath analysis.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went off all dairy (and I mean I searched out every possible little <br/>\nadditive to every food) for a few years. I tried raw milk and raw cheese <br/>\nand goat&#39;s milk and everything else anybody ever suggested. All have <br/>\nlactose - raw milk has just as much lactose as pasteurized milk.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome producers of raw milk claim there is lactase IN the raw milk. That <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t appear to be true - if it was true, there would be no lactose, <br/>\nas the lactase would break down the lactose right there in the milk. <br/>\nWhat raw milk has is what they call friendly bacteria - those friendly <br/>\nbacteria might sometimes help a person produce more lactase. If your <br/>\nbody just can&#39;t produce lactase, no matter what, the extra bacteria <br/>\nwon&#39;t help. If the bacter/a will help, there are ways to take probiotics <br/>\nthat might help more consistently - raw milk is very inconsistent in <br/>\nwhat bacteria are in it plus the bacteria needs to be taken <br/>\nconsistently, to build up and create an environment in the digestive <br/>\nsystem that facilitates lactase production.<br/>\n/<br/>\n<br/>\n/Also, most people start to produce less and less lactase as they get <br/>\nolder and become less able to tolerate as much lactose - and the ability <br/>\nto produce lactase can be inconsistent. So, one day I would be able to <br/>\ndrink a big glass of milk and another day the amount of milk in a muffin <br/>\nmight do me in.<br/>\n/<br/>\n<br/>\n/Anyway - that is all about lactose intolerance - not allergy. <br/>\nUnfortunately, some people have both - a not-insignificant number - <br/>\nwhich confuses the issue even more.<br/>\n/<br/>\n<br/>\n/-pam<br/>\n/</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:Food allergy question","postDate":"1236964614","msgId":38889,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM3MTBFQTQ0LTExREEtNDU3NS1BMkE2LTREMzkwQTU1MkQ3M0Bjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFDREQ0QTVCLUIzRjEtNDIyNC04RTg2LTk1MDg2REUxQzFBM0BnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PENPTDExNS1XODIyMzgzNTg3NjkwOENCMTc2ODkyNkI5OUYwQHBoeC5nYmw+IDwyOEU5QjcyOC04QTQ0LTQwM0ItOERBMi0yNzIyREJENTA1NzVAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+IDxBQ0RENEE1Qi1CM0YxLTQyMjQtOEU4Ni05NTA4NkRFMUMxQTNAZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38888,"nextInTopic":38891,"prevInTime":38888,"nextInTime":38890,"topicId":38852,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My son is allergic to ALL nuts and I trade out Halloween candy with him and have to bake his birthday cakes. He&#39;s also allergic to soy and has outgrown an egg allergy. Luckily soy won&#39;t kill him like nuts could especially since it&#39;s in everything! He does feel like he&#39;s missing out at times. What&#39;s funny is he&#39;s the only kid I can think of that didn&#39;t like peanut butter crackers! (We didn&#39;t know he was allergic until about 5.)  It&#39;s not a big deal to him as long as there is an alternative.

Ask her which dairy foods are the ones she wants to be eating, and then work with her to find a substitute.  When I first started nursing my daughter, I had to go on a non-dairy diet for about 18 months, and during that time I had to completely re-vamp my diet.  I found ways to cook most things with non-dairy alternatives.  Ice-cream, for instance - there are pretty yummy rice-milk  and soy based ice creams in major supermarkets these days.  Or you could get an ice-cream maker and make your own.  Your daughter may like doing this with you!  I also found non-dairy solid fats at the health food store so that I could make pie crusts with - not as yummy as butter, but better than no pie!  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing - have you tried other forms of dairy other than cow?  Some people find goat milk to be a lot less allergy-causing than other milks.  I&#39;ve also read some interesting info about how similar donkey milk is to human breastmilk.  Not sure if you could find donkey milk to try, but maybe google it?  <br/>\n<br/>\nTrish<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Lindsey&quot; &lt;lao80@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My daughter Ramsey, 4, has problems with milk.

We make yogurt and soft cheese and drink the delicious cream floating on the top and all of the sweet milk.  The kids love it.
