Neither does my husband, and <br/>\n  he just works around it. Both have other strong memorization skills, but <br/>\n  for my son it looks sometimes like it takes him a really, really long time to <br/>\n  learn some things.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But no one is there telling him or quizzing him or setting him up to fail. <br/>\n  He learns and remembers at his own pace (slow!) and he is a happy kid. <br/>\n  Unschooling is great for &quot;different&quot; learners because there is no stress involved <br/>\n  other than what they put on themselves. They aren&#39;t trying to please someone <br/>\n  or get a grade or compete.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Plus, they develop other skills to make up for areas where they aren&#39;t <br/>\n  strong. Just like a bad speller can learn to use spell check, my husband has <br/>\n  developed his own ways of remembering things.<br/>\n<br/>\n  By the way, my son went to a museum today with a great dinosaur exhibit. I <br/>\n  told him it was a t-rex and he said &quot;No!! it has three toes and t-rex has <br/>\n  two!&quot;. He was right, it was argentinasaurus. I am a great rote learner and I <br/>\n  probably would have never picked up on that. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Have fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Leslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":275081603,"authorName":"Tommy","from":"&quot;Tommy&quot; &lt;tommyhawk41256@...&gt;","profile":"girlyd2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Quick question newbie","postDate":"1151596107","msgId":17669,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTUwMWM2OWI5MyQ3Njc3ZmE3MCQ3NDg5YTg0NUB5b3Vyd2c1bjMzZHV0dj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwOTI4MjMwNTAzLjk0NzY4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjYwODExLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17668,"nextInTopic":17671,"prevInTime":17668,"nextInTime":17670,"topicId":17643,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That just might work thank you never thought about that. ...
