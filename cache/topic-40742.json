Now he creates them from legos and boffer sword materials.  People around me would get so upset that I would &quot;allow&quot; him to do this.  I believe in peace, I believe there is a diplomatic way to handle situations.  I also believe I would do all I could to protect my family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son love strategy.  He will watch anything to do with it from William Wallace to Ghengis Khan to the Revolutionary war.  Maybe it is ancestral memory?  Who knows, but he has a strong pull in that direction as well.  I don&#39;t think he thinks of it as killing others.  At this point it is just play.  Maybe he will grow up to be a great detective helping find the &quot;bad guys&quot; or maybe he will be a comedian.  Maybe that will be his spy cover....stand up comic on weekends, spy during the week.  lol<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet that book would be great fun here as well, thanks for mentioning it.

My ds is 5y.o and I am wondering what can I do to make his life more interesting.  At present he is wanting to play playstation alot of the time, and Im sure its because I am not providing enough to engage him.  I see him with his Dad and hes so happy to be doing stuff, any stuff with Dad - which is lovely.  However I am a girly type (for want of a better phrase) and ds is my first son and I just seem to find, that no matter how I try I cant seem to connect with what he could be (potentially) interested in, whereas with Dad its just a done deal, no effort needed.  At present he is madly into guns, I build them with him, we play gun games, draw them, but my brain stops at about that point.  I would love to just take his lead, however at this stage he isnt leading much and I wonder if Im doing something wrong or whether I have an expectation that Im not seeing?  I know these questions are probably very basic for many of you, but I would appreciate your knowledge to point me in the right direction as I really agree with the whole philosophy just seem to be floundering with the practical aspects.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Camille :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40756,"nextTopicId":40760}}
