But<br/>\nto just dump on you because he has a different opinion is neither<br/>\nhelpful to the development of your son, nor to the health of your<br/>\nrelationship with him.  Let him know that you want to have growth in<br/>\nboth areas, that you value him, but that the way he seems to be trying<br/>\nto contribute makes you feel (insert your own feelings, stated in a<br/>\nway that won&#39;t put him on the defensive.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHas he done any research on homeschooling?  On the benefits,<br/>\nparticularly for a child who, like your son, was overwhelmed by the<br/>\nphysical environment of a ps?  If not, perhaps he needs to learn a bit<br/>\nmore, so he can understand what is going on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure others will have other ideas, but that is where I might try<br/>\nto start from.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sharissa13 &lt;sharissa13@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; We pulled my autistic son out of public school 3 years<br/>\n&gt; ago after kindergarten.
