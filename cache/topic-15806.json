This way, I pay him when I sit down to pay the rest of <br/>\nthe household bills). No ties to behavior. The way I figure it, DH <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t &quot;earn&quot; any moneys he might spend (I WOH fulltime and DH is <br/>\nhome with DS fulltime). Yes, he does dishes and laundry and whatnot <br/>\nbut I wouldn&#39;t tell him &quot;No you can&#39;t pick up that whatzit you want <br/>\nevven though we have the money available because you didn&#39;t finish <br/>\nthe laundry this week.&quot; What he does around the house to make it <br/>\ncomfortable and pleasant is not tied to money. It&#39;s tied to simply <br/>\nbeing part of the family. Ditto for DS. His current favorite thing <br/>\nis getting the weed whacker out and going to town on the out of the <br/>\nway corners of the yard (mailbox, along the base of the deck, out by <br/>\nthe garden boxes, etc). No money involved - DH just asked him one <br/>\nday a couple weeks ago as he was heading out to do yard work if DS <br/>\nwanted to use the weed whacker. DH showed him how to handle it <br/>\nsafely and all and off he went. This past Saturday morning, we were <br/>\ntrying to lay out plans for the day because we wanted to go <br/>\ncanoeing. DS said &quot;I want to do a bit of weed whacking so I&#39;ll go <br/>\nget dressed&quot; and off he went, got dressed, got the weeder out and <br/>\nspent about 20-30 minutes out there then came in and the day moved <br/>\non. We didn&#39;t ask nor was it tied to his &quot;allowance&quot;. He just enjoys <br/>\ndoing it and it helps out. <br/>\n<br/>\nHis money is for things he wants to get that either (a) he&#39;s got <br/>\ncash for and we don&#39;t - I don&#39;t always have cash on hand for bits <br/>\nand pieces like a soda at the mini mart, if he wants one, he uses <br/>\nhis cash. (b) particular hobbies he might have - he&#39;s into golf so <br/>\nhe might use some of his cash for a round of mini golf or a bucket <br/>\nof balls at the driving range (BTW we also chipped in some to get <br/>\na &#39;pass&#39; that is rechargeable so he need not have cash *every* time <br/>\nhe goes to the driving range). (c) being generous - sometimes he&#39;ll <br/>\nsuggest that he &quot;treat&quot; when we go out on our weekly mom & son date <br/>\nnight. Other times we go Dutch and sometimes I &quot;treat&quot;. It varies. <br/>\nAnd so on. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do discuss how much we can spend for this or that - for instance, <br/>\nhe wanted 4 of something (a set) that would have run about $40. I <br/>\nhadn&#39;t planned on spending that much (we were also picking up a <br/>\nbirthday gift for a friend of his). I said that I could afford to <br/>\nbuy the gift he had chosen and 2 of the set items. He wanted all 4. <br/>\nSo, he agreed that it would be okay if I held onto his &quot;allowance&quot; <br/>\nin order to pay (that portion of) the credit card bill when it came <br/>\nin - which meant it would be a full month (2 paydays) and he agreed <br/>\nand did not whine, complain or otherwise indicate he was unhappy <br/>\nwith the deal for the whole time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t talk exact dollars most of the time because once it gots <br/>\nabove about $20, it&#39;s just &quot;a lot&quot; to him. We&#39;ll discuss things and <br/>\nhe knows how to check and compare prices in the store and all so he <br/>\nhas some idea of how much things cost and so on. We just don&#39;t go <br/>\ninto major detail with all the bills - heck, I don&#39;t even discuss <br/>\nthe bills in major detail with DH. Fixed expenses are fixed expenses <br/>\nand he knows roughly how much they are and we don&#39;t do a lot of <br/>\ndiscussing, unless there are changes occurring (like the oil budget <br/>\namount going up when the prices increased). We will discuss long <br/>\nterm and variable expenses (student loan, credit cards) as far as <br/>\nhow to prioritize the money we have available. And when DS comes to <br/>\nthe market with me, we have the list of what we need and then if we <br/>\nnotice something we want, we jot down the item, price, aisle number <br/>\non the side and when we get to the end of the list, if there is <br/>\nspace in the budget, we look at those &quot;wish list&quot; items and see what <br/>\nthe best deal we can get is - one $6 ice cream or a 24 pack of <br/>\npuddings or 3 boxes of snack cakes or 2 large containers of cottage <br/>\ncheese or a bunch of yogurts or whatever (all of these have been <br/>\nactual discussions - sometimes we get the snack cakes, sometimes the <br/>\ncheese, sometimes 1 snack cakes and 1 cottage cheese). <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, we consider the money that comes in as &#39;family funds&#39; and <br/>\nwe try to use them as best as possible for the family&#39;s interests, <br/>\nwants, and needs. If there&#39;s something that comes up, we&#39;ll check <br/>\nout prices, options, and discuss it. For instance, we were just <br/>\ndiscussing that we might want to spend some of the money we earmark <br/>\nfor next year&#39;s vacation to purchase a pair of kayaks when they go <br/>\non sale at the end of the season and take closer to home vacations <br/>\nwhere we can use them. It&#39;s a family discussion not just a grown up <br/>\ndiscussion. BUT we do generally, because of DS&#39; nature, talk things <br/>\nout between us (DH and me) before we broach it with DS - if we find <br/>\nthrough researching that it is not financially possible, we don&#39;t <br/>\neven bring up the option to DS. If it&#39;s possible IF we change this <br/>\nor do that, we bring it up and discuss all the options.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: access to family funds","postDate":"1153148810","msgId":15808,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5ZzkyYStoYWo4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU5ZjdmdCsybXBrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15807,"nextInTopic":15809,"prevInTime":15807,"nextInTime":15809,"topicId":15806,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... family? ... also ... my ... should ...

They realize that there is<br/>\na finite amount to that money.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey each get pocket money and it is tied to their age only in that it<br/>\nworks well that way and tends to be about the amount that they need<br/>\nfor expenditures.  However, their limited funds don&#39;t mean that they<br/>\ncan&#39;t have something that they are really wanting.  For instance<br/>\nyesterday we went to the bookstore and Emily had a bit of money.  She<br/>\nfound a CD of a band that she *really* likes but didn&#39;t have enough<br/>\nmoney for it.  I gladly bought it for her and was glad I could do so.<br/>\nNo &quot;you owe me&quot; or &quot;this will come out of your allowance.&quot;  Just,<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve got the money and am glad that I can share it with you.&quot;  That<br/>\nisn&#39;t always the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey know that if I have the money I will share it with them.  Their<br/>\n&quot;allowance&quot; is basically for that feeling of independence.  As an<br/>\nexample, yesterday&#39;s bookstore adventure also included my son wanting<br/>\nthe latest Kingdom Hearts manga.  Something I was willing to purchase<br/>\nfor him as I was purchasing other items including the aforementioned<br/>\nCD.
