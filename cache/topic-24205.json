I&#39;m new to the group, and just wanted to say hello. My name is  <br/>\nKaren and I&#39;m unschooling my youngest 2, Julian who is 4 3/4 and Julia who will  <br/>\nbe 2 really soon :) I also am gently getting my oldest son, 17, into  <br/>\nunschooling, trying to help him learn to trust himself, and all kinds of good  stuff. <br/>\nMy daughter, Grace, is in conventional school right now, but I am hoping  that <br/>\nwill change in time - and soon! (my first set, aka, &quot;Group 1&quot; lol, are my  <br/>\nkids from my first marriage to a very conventional man, they were all  <br/>\nconventionally &quot;educated&quot; and I am not trying to undo the mess that created).  Anyway, <br/>\nthat&#39;s me! <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks to my friend Bebe for introducing me to this list! I&#39;m really  <br/>\nenjoying the conversations and am loving the time I&#39;m having with my kids. <br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24172,"nextTopicId":24173}}
