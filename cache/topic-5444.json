Often the kids doing the <br/>\nquizzing don&#39;t know the answer either. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son didn&#39;t get the point of the quizzing - when someone would ask him <br/>\nsomething he didn&#39;t know, he&#39;d say &quot;No, I don&#39;t. What *IS* 1/4 of 20?&quot; or whatever <br/>\nthe question had been. Quite often the other kid would sputter something <br/>\nabout just wanting to know if they could figure it out. Or Patrick would start <br/>\ntalking to himself trying to figure the problem out, which usually baffled the <br/>\nschool kid - we&#39;ve noticed lots of kids think of math as something you know or <br/>\ndon&#39;t know, not as ideas to think about or problems to be solved, which is how <br/>\nPatrick thinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the questions were along the lines of &quot;Have you learned fractions <br/>\nyet?&quot; and Pat would answer yes or no and then ask something about what the <br/>\nother kid knew about fractions, what was interesting about them, etc. He wanted to <br/>\nknow if it was something worth learning or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey were interesting interactions to watch, because the two kids really <br/>\nweren&#39;t having the same conversation.

They are well armed when outsiders attempt to compare and contrast.  It doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t notice what other schooled kids their own age are learning.  But a.  they do recognize that even schooled kids don&#39;t always &#39;know&#39; what is being taught and b. each persons unique brilliance is reinforced so that they are aware not only of their own special gifts but that each person has unique gifts and specialties of interest and thus unique set of knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for teasing by others, well that in itself is a great opportunity for discussion.  <br/>\nIf it happened here where my dd was embarrassed by not knowing something I might ask my dd if she is interested in learning the subject?  Is it important for her to &quot;keep up with&quot; kids in school?  How important is it to her to learn it now?  Does she want to learn they way kids her age are taught in school?  Or how would she like to go about learning what kids in school are taught?  We&#39;ve had similar discussions about some subjects and the result was her dedication to learning a tool now or not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that might be pointed out is that your son may already know fractions but not in terms of the way it looks in school.  It may not be about comparing apples and oranges, but fuji vs granny smith vs pink ladies.

LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now for my problem...at the end of this month, their evaluation is<br/>\n  scheduled. There is a local group in town who does the evaluations<br/>\n  for all the homeschoolers. (Volusia County requires all<br/>\n  homeschooled children to be evaluated by certified teachers and that<br/>\n  evaluation be sent to the school board). Anyway, this being my<br/>\n  first unschooling year, I have nothing prepared. We are supposed to<br/>\n  bring a folder with &quot;sample&quot; work performed by each child.
