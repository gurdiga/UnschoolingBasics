Correctly, I might add.  He couldn&#39;t tell me how he knew the<br/>\nanswers to many of the questions, but that doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from measuring for baking, playing cribbage, or figuring out how<br/>\nmuch paint needed to paint a room, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve actually &quot;done&quot;<br/>\nany math.  Certainly we haven&#39;t done more than one concept beyond<br/>\ncounting.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s proven to me I need to have more faith in him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s proven I need to have more faith in unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just works.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, when I did college for Registered Massage Therapy, they almost<br/>\ndidn&#39;t let me in because of 2 low science marks.  I was informed that<br/>\nI would have been accepted immediately, and without interview, without<br/>\nany diploma.  I get the impression that badges in boy scouts are more<br/>\nmeaningful.<br/>\n<br/>\nJMO,<br/>\n<br/>\nLianne<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;cartoontv5&quot; &lt;LJeanne28@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi.Thanks for all this great info.
