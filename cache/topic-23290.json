Its entirely situational.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday we had one of our big skatepark days - its over an hour&#39;s <br/>\ndrive, so we tend to make a day of it. There&#39;s a great playground <br/>\nright next to the skatepark, so Morgan and I hang out there while <br/>\nRay skates. As luck would have it, Ray fell about an hour after we <br/>\ngot there, and decided he was too battered to keep skating - nothing <br/>\nserious, he just didn&#39;t want to fall any more that day. Mo wasn&#39;t <br/>\nanywhere near done playing, though, so he hung out and another <br/>\nunschooling mom from our regular playgroup showed up about the same <br/>\ntime with a dd about Mo&#39;s age. Just setting the scene, here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this other girl is right about Mo&#39;s speed in terms of <br/>\nphyiscallity - think Mac truck in a skirt and pigtails. Now imagine <br/>\ntwo of them. They invented a game that involved chasing Ray all over <br/>\nthe playground, tackling him, hitting him, throwing things at him - <br/>\nhe thought it was lots of fun. And less painful than falling of his <br/>\nskateboard, although he did put his pads back on. This kind of <br/>\nconsensual rough play is normal for Rayan, as much as it is for <br/>\nMorgan. *He* is big enough now that he&#39;ll rough-house with adults - <br/>\nreal grown men wrestling, and although they&#39;re still going easy on <br/>\nhim, this is relative. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo to say hitting is unsafe or unacceptable doesn&#39;t fly with my <br/>\nkids. We have to talk about different bodies and personalities and <br/>\nconsent and ways to say no and hear no from others. They&#39;re both <br/>\ngreat about understanding that younger kids need to be handled a bit <br/>\nmore gently, but Mo&#39;s still sometimes baffled when she encounters a <br/>\nkid her age or older who doesn&#39;t like to play rough, so I try to <br/>\nkeep an eye out for new situations. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have an almost<br/>\n&gt; two year old who at this time in her life does get that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>frustrated, she has<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not hit a person but will throw the toy... My 4 yo is very passive <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and would<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; give the toy away and walk away before anything was an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You know a lot of that is temperament, though, right? Some kids are <br/>\nnaturally more easy going, more accomodating, more, as you say, <br/>\npassive. Its not a result of better parenting. Some kids absolutely <br/>\ndo need more help knowing *when* its not okay to hit someone or help <br/>\nwith impulse control. I have certainly met parents who don&#39;t help <br/>\ntheir kids figure these things out and &quot;blame the victim&quot; for not <br/>\nfighting back, and I&#39;m not advocating that in the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am trying to say is that to really physical kids, saying &quot;its <br/>\nnot okay to hit&quot; is pure bs. It *is* okay to hit sometimes, for <br/>\nprotection or for fun.

Independence <br/>\nis a big-time cultural value, and for young kids, <br/>\nespecially, &quot;promoting independence&quot; is considered pretty important. <br/>\nSome unschoolers get kind of stuck on the whole independence thing, <br/>\nthinking it means we shouldn&#39;t help our kids figure out the world. <br/>\nLearning in freedom becomes equated with hands off parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, being an unschooler, and even understanding that <br/>\nkids need help figuring out the world, doesn&#39;t automatically make <br/>\nsomeone the world&#39;s most skillful parent.

When it was brought up kindly that there was a<br/>\n&gt; problem, the mom left huffily.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This struck a chord with me - was the mom confronted *after* this <br/>\nhappened or did someone call mom&#39;s attention to the problem while it <br/>\nwas happening? Mo&#39;s 5.5 and usually plays really well at public <br/>\nplaygrounds, so I often hang out with the other moms and chat on <br/>\nhomeschool group days. The vast majority of the time, that&#39;s fine, <br/>\nand I&#39;ll either notice or someone will tell me if there&#39;s a problem <br/>\nthat I need to address.

I drifted away, feeling as though I <br/>\nwas expected to go beat or yell at my kid, even though I knew the <br/>\nfamily to be unschoolers. When I asked Morgan about the incident <br/>\nlater, she didn&#39;t know what I was talking about. I keep a closer eye <br/>\non Mo when that family comes to playgroups, though. The kids are <br/>\ndainty, and Mo&#39;s really robust, so its a good idea anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A second was at a museum, where a preschool aged child was<br/>\n&gt; hitting/slapping/ the youngers (one year, two years <br/>\n&gt; old) in an attempt to get the toys he wanted.

Not the <br/>\nmost socially-ept of ages. Where were the babies moms? Were you left <br/>\nin charge of the little ones so moms could take older siblings to <br/>\nanother area?

It might be better to <br/>\navoid the implied judgement and say &quot;OW! That hurts!&quot; to a child who <br/>\nis hitting.

Neither of these moms has a social network of other <br/>\nunschooling families, though, which I think could be a big factor. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, those two families were my first experiences <br/>\nwith &quot;unschooling&quot;.

Allowing your child to hurt<br/>\nother people has absolutely nothing to do with unschooling.

Yuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a young child is showing any signs of having trouble interacting<br/>\nwith other children, it&#39;s really great if a parent can get very close,<br/>\nlisten and remove the child if they are going to hit or hurt other<br/>\npeople. I&#39;m really sorry you&#39;re having such difficulties with other<br/>\nunschoolers. It&#39;s very sad to me that anyone would get in a huff when<br/>\na baby was  being protected from harm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t have any problem telling the mother &quot;your child is hurting<br/>\nthe baby, could you please help me with this?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like a lack of parenting to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Anon post:  Unschooling groups","postDate":"1176974630","msgId":23293,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA1NUM5OTU1LUI3NTItNEVBMi1BQjVBLTgzNDE1ODRGQTNEN0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYwNnQyaCt0bzV1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGYwNnQyaCt0bzV1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23290,"nextInTopic":23295,"prevInTime":23292,"nextInTime":23294,"topicId":23290,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Having said  that, <br/>\nthere have been a few incidents that leave me scratching my head. One<br/>\nwas at a beach playdate, where an older child was verbally abusing<br/>\nsome of the toddlers, calling them names, pushing them around, really<br/>\nwithout provocation. When it was brought up kindly that there was a<br/>\nproblem, the mom left huffily.<br/>\n<br/>\nA second was at a museum, where a preschool aged child was<br/>\nhitting/slapping/ the youngers (one year, two years <br/>\nold) in an attempt to get the toys he wanted. In all situations, i was<br/>\npresent and did what I would do with my older children, some modeling,<br/>\nempathy, redirection. &quot;Wow, you really want that toy! Would you like<br/>\nto play with this one, she&#39;s already playing with that one!&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;Why don&#39;t you ask for a trade, you can offer her this one, and<br/>\nmaybe she&#39;ll share.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nShe very nearly always got what she wanted out of the deal. Finally<br/>\nafter the second gut punch to a baby, I said &quot;It is NOT okay to hit.<br/>\nYou may use words to ask for what you want.&quot; When I <br/>\nmoved the baby to protect it, *I* was the next one hit. The mom was<br/>\nstanding right there and told her that what she was doing was okay,<br/>\nand I got an evil look from BOTH of them. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere in unschooling does it say that this is okay? Have I missed<br/>\nsomething? It seems to me as I was reading John Holt that he said it<br/>\nwas just as off to be a &#39;child-worshiper&#39;, believing they could do no<br/>\nwrong, as it was to be a &#39;child-manager&#39;, believing they could do no<br/>\nright without us.<br/>\n<br/>\n Are we responsible for modeling behavior that is fair to everyone in<br/>\na situation? Is it unfair to expect safety for all children, not just<br/>\nthose who can express their needs by hurting others verbally or<br/>\nphysically? My daughter is starting to really dislike these kids, and<br/>\nis starting to dislike our trips. Surely we aren&#39;t the only family on <br/>\nhere facing this issue.
