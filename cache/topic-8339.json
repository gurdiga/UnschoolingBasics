Tommorow is a new da y. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a great way to look at it...each day is a new day to do better, <br/>\nto learn and grow, just like our children.<br/>\nMaking them go to bed is a better option than yelling or hitting, and <br/>\nnext time things get tense, maybe the option will be a distraction, or <br/>\na drive or something nicer than going to bed.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy to blame the unschooling, after all, we&#39;re in uncharted <br/>\nterritory...it can feel uneasy to re-write the book on parenting that <br/>\nwe were handed as children. But we&#39;re doing it. One day, one moment at <br/>\na time, the shift happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8335,"nextTopicId":8334}}
