You made a really hard decision  to ask your  daughter to <br/>\nleave, NOT because you don&#39;t love her or want her, but because you  had to <br/>\nprotect the whole family. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s angry. Hopefully her grandmother  will <br/>\ncare for her without buying into her anger. Stay in touch with her. Call  her <br/>\nevery day, even if she won&#39;t talk to you. Not to process or discuss her  <br/>\nissues, but just checking in. Encourage the other kids to stay in touch with her  <br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n <br/>\nGood luck:)<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25259,"nextTopicId":25339}}
