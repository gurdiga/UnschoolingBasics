And I<br/>\nam really thinking of you and sending you good thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I would have to say that I think you and your child should see<br/>\nsomeone professionally as soon as possible. A therapist could really<br/>\nbring some insight to what the root of the problem is. I wouldn&#39;t let<br/>\nthe person dwell on unschooling or anything out of this range, a lot<br/>\nof times therapists want a quick solution, just stick with the<br/>\nsituation that is in front of you. Your son has a lot of anger and<br/>\nright now he is not seeing you as a good person. It doesn&#39;t look like<br/>\nthis will just go away on its own, it will probably just keep coming<br/>\nup and coming up maybe even in different forms.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your child is seeing sex as something dirty you need to find out<br/>\nwhere that information came from. It just may be that he has seen some<br/>\nimages either on tv or online that were really hard core.<br/>\nBut it seems to me that he is really sending up some danger signals.<br/>\nI think you could talk about this for a long time and still never get<br/>\nto the core of what is happened in his head. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also have to disagree with someone telling you to apologize. Your<br/>\nson might think you are really guilty of something bad if you keep<br/>\napologizing for nothing. (what would you be apologizing for? having<br/>\nsex? That is NOTHING to be ashamed of or that you need to be SORRY<br/>\nabout. That is what brought that child into this world. Beautiful,<br/>\nconsensual sex should be revered and honored not apologized for. I<br/>\nthink your son needs to know or be reminded that it is a wonderful,<br/>\nbeautiful thing to have sex with the person you love and even some ppl<br/>\nyou don&#39;t;). But also all sex is not the same, there is also dangerous<br/>\nscary sex, molestation, rape, incest. There are appropriate ways to<br/>\nexplain abuse to a child of 10, I explain to my 9 yr old, that<br/>\nviolence can take many forms. And that the victims is never guilty or<br/>\nbad, simply because something bad has happened to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing, have you talked about the fact that he himself is a<br/>\ndirect result of sex and so is everyone he knows!! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is lashing out at you directly, I would think that it is because<br/>\nhe feels safe enough with you to try to defuse and process whatever<br/>\nhas happened and still be in a place of love. Feel good that he knows<br/>\nyou love him enough to support him through this, even if that is<br/>\nunconcious on his part. But his actions are not appropriate, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t apologize and let him call you vile names, I would get him<br/>\nsome help. <br/>\nGood luck to you, and know that you are really supported here!!<br/>\nsuzanne<br/>\n<br/>\nIn unschoolingbasics@ &lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;Momma&quot; &lt;southernbelle@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really need some help here.

Although they got on really well (and still do because<br/>\nI&#39;ve now been married to the guy for 6 yrs !) my son would completely freak<br/>\nout if I went out on dates in the evening. Turns out he was just very scared<br/>\nof losing the special relationship we had together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wonder whether your ds - now being aware of the sexual element to<br/>\nadult relationships- has realised that this is something you share with dh<br/>\nthat he can&#39;t share with you ?<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd into the mix his new knowledge of what sex is and I could kind of<br/>\nunderstand where he might be coming from. Maybe the idea of sex grosses him<br/>\nout a bit (I know it did me when I first thought about it in any depth!) and<br/>\nhe&#39;s both grossed out and a little terrified at what this new info means to<br/>\nyour relationship ?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts - hope they don&#39;t offend :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\nMomma &lt;southernbelle@ &lt;mailto:southernbelle%40gvtc.com&gt; gvtc.com&gt; wrote:<br/>\nI did respond to one of his emails this morning but he&#39;s still asleep and<br/>\nhasn&#39;t responded yet.

It&#39;s hard <br/>\nfor me to know exactly what to do, since I don&#39;t know you or your son <br/>\nor what the actual conversations were that triggered his intense <br/>\nreaction.

How would you feel about writing him a note or an email <br/>\nto ask for a truce? I think I would tell him that I can see he&#39;s <br/>\n**really** upset with me, and that I want to understand better what <br/>\nhis issue is and help him work this through so we can heal our <br/>\nrelationship. I would tell him that I&#39;m the same person I&#39;ve always <br/>\nbeen and that I love him hugely and am sad to see him in so much <br/>\npain. I would also ask him if there may be someone else he&#39;d feel <br/>\ncomfortable with to work this through. I would be sure to apologize <br/>\nfor any way I might have hurt or confused him without my knowing <br/>\n(but, that&#39;s the way I am).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think those actions may at least get your toe in the door, but I <br/>\nreally don&#39;t know.

He and his<br/>\ndad don&#39;t have a very close relationship and honestly I would be a little<br/>\nconcerned about what my dh might say in a conversation like that. He&#39;s not<br/>\nvery tactful and I think would be too embarrassed himself to have that<br/>\nconversation. He thinks ds should figure it out on his own. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe spoke yesterday about hormones and the changes they create in our bodies<br/>\nand they changes that would happen to his body in particular. He seemed<br/>\nshocked by it all. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you are right on all these points and I will see if I can think of<br/>\nsomeone else that he could talk to about this. The only kids he hangs out<br/>\nwith are his sister(7) and the other homeschoolers we meet once a week for<br/>\nrecreation. We&#39;ve only been once since we just found them. We moved recently<br/>\nand haven&#39;t found many kids in our rural area. <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn, do you have a minister/priest/rabbi/iman/pastor/etc who could<br/>\ntalk to him? I remember my brother went through a similar thing. Sex<br/>\nwas a dirty word to him at that age. He also told my parents not to<br/>\n&quot;do that&quot; anymore. (I think he still likes to believe in immaculate<br/>\nconception to answer his and our sibling&#39;s existance even at 34yo and<br/>\na child of his own.) We are sexual creatures. It&#39;s just a part of<br/>\nour lives. I remember my mom had our priest talk to my brother about<br/>\nsome sexual issues he was going through. It helped him to know that<br/>\nour priest had sex (Episcopal priests can marry) and had a sexual<br/>\nlife. It also helped to hear from someone my brother revered that sex<br/>\nwas natural and a good thing and nothing to be ashamed of.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you seen him naked recently? I ask this because I wonder if<br/>\nthere are some changes going on in his body that maybe happening<br/>\nearlier than with other boys his age. Maybe his friends are not going<br/>\nthrough those changes as quickly? Perhaps he said something about the<br/>\npresence of hair or enlargement of genetalia or perhaps even an<br/>\nerection or sexually vivid dream and was ridiculed or made fun of. I<br/>\nremember that my brother went from being &quot;Mr. Exhibitionist&quot; to<br/>\n&quot;Eeeek! You might see my body&quot; in just a matter of weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be a place where mom can step back and let a trusted male do<br/>\nsome talking. It may be that anything that you say may make things<br/>\nworse. He may find you just trying to justify yourself. Perhaps he<br/>\nneeds to see a male pov about sexual issues. See things from a &quot;man&#39;s<br/>\nperspective&quot; so to speak. And it could be the whole &quot;mother is<br/>\nsacred&quot; thing that he is having problems with. He may consider you<br/>\n&quot;sicko&quot; because his *mother* did &quot;those things&quot; and for some children<br/>\nthat is a very difficult thing to consider. To prove that point, I<br/>\nwas in my late 20&#39;s maybe early 30&#39;s when my mom made some reference<br/>\nto her sexualness. (Had to do with not being able to live with the<br/>\nShakers because they don&#39;t have sex.) GASP! My *mom* has sex. And<br/>\nthen a year or so ago I was helping my mom clean out my dad&#39;s office<br/>\n(again) and came across a sample pack of Viagra!! Why would my<br/>\n*parents* need *that*? :-D It&#39;s sometimes difficult for even grown<br/>\nchildren who see themselves as sexual creatures to think of their<br/>\nparents as sexual creatures.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle - whose 11yo is convinced that there must be some other way<br/>\nfor people to get pregnant than having sex!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Help with ds-sex","postDate":"1159890428","msgId":17788,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOEI1MUE1MUFFMzlBNC04RkMtNDc4N0BXRUJNQUlMLU1DMTYuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYxMDAzMDk1Mi42NTE0NTIyNmIyNzNiQHJseS14bjA1Lm14LmFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYxMDAzMDk1Mi42NTE0NTIyNmIyNzNiQHJseS14bjA1Lm14LmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17787,"nextInTopic":17789,"prevInTime":17787,"nextInTime":17789,"topicId":17776,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He is very embarrassed<br/>\nabout anything having to do with sex so I was very happy that he was <br/>\nable to<br/>\neven ask. I answered all of his questions as honestly as I could. He <br/>\ntold me<br/>\nafter each conversation that he was so grateful that he had a mother <br/>\nwho was<br/>\nnot embarrassed to talk about sex and everything was so great.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCool.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut has he talked to friends about it or played on the &#39;net to see what <br/>\nit *looks* like?<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember being ten and having two friends tell me what it was all <br/>\nabout. I KNEW they were lying through their teeth---NOTHING could be <br/>\nthat disgusting! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan, at ten, has a better idea about sex than I did, but he still <br/>\nfinds it pretty gross. He laughs at sex jokes on Family Guy---and loves <br/>\nStephen Lynch&#39;s &quot;The Bad Professor&quot; song, but he&#39;s actually still in <br/>\nthe dark about what it *really* is. I mean---he groans at all the right <br/>\nspots, but I think he&#39;s just following the laugh tracks and our own <br/>\nrolling eyes! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday he had a couple of questions for me and, again, I answered <br/>\nthem<br/>\nthe best I could. Somehow the conversation took a turn and he started <br/>\nto get<br/>\nupset. He started asking personal questions about me and his dad&#39;s sex <br/>\nlife.<br/>\nHe said that he didn&#39;t want me and his dad having sex anymore. When I <br/>\nasked<br/>\nhim why he said because it embarrassed him. He became very upset and was<br/>\ncrying and very angry. He went to his room and took a long nap. I <br/>\nthought<br/>\nmaybe he had just been tired and he would feel better when he woke up. <br/>\nHe<br/>\ndid for a few minutes after he woke up. He came to me and gave me a hug <br/>\nand<br/>\nsaid he was sorry. We joked a little about his hormones, which we had <br/>\njust<br/>\ntalked about earlier during the day. (I should mention that dh is out of<br/>\ntown for a couple of days) Everything seemed fine and we got ready to <br/>\ngo get<br/>\nsome dinner. He asked me a kind of off-handed question as we were <br/>\nleaving<br/>\nand then got very irate. He started yelling, calling me a disgusting <br/>\nsicko.<br/>\nI tried to talk to him but he said &quot;Just get away from me you sicko!&quot; I <br/>\nwas<br/>\nvery hurt but I decided to leave him alone and let him calm down. He <br/>\ndidn&#39;t.<br/>\nIn the drive-through in the car he asked me how many toothpicks it would<br/>\ntake to spell out sicko. He wouldn&#39;t talk to me all night. He kept <br/>\nslamming<br/>\nthings around and walking by my room where I was laying in bed. To be <br/>\nhonest<br/>\nI was a little afraid to go to sleep last night and considered locking <br/>\nmy<br/>\ndoor because he seemed SO angry. I called his dad and told him what was<br/>\ngoing on and dh tried to talk to him. Then when I woke up this morning <br/>\nhe<br/>\nhad posted signs all over the house saying sicko. He sent me about 50 <br/>\nemails<br/>\ncalling me a disgusting sicko and one saying that he would never speak <br/>\nto me<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp!!!<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry you&#39;re going through this---but think about it:  it DOES seem <br/>\npretty sicko from a ten year old point of view---and *I* would actually <br/>\nhope that it WOULD! I wouldn&#39;t want a ten year old to think it&#39;s <br/>\nsomething he should run out and do. The sicko feeling is probably <br/>\n*healthy*!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, I think the idea of your *PARENTS&#39;* doing anything remotely <br/>\nsexual would seem weird to a kid---it&#39;s still weird for ME to think <br/>\nabout my parents&#39; having sex! &lt;bwg&gt; I remember when Cam and I were <br/>\ndiscussing sex when he was 17: he was a little weirded out when I told <br/>\nhim that his dad and I had had sex as recently as that morning. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be OK. Time and patience. But I hope he&#39;ll try to <br/>\nexplain *why* he&#39;s having such strong feelings. I&#39;m sure neither of you <br/>\nlikes to be in this position! He&#39;s probably really, really confused and <br/>\nweirded out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry---no words of wisdom. Maybe someone else has been in this <br/>\nsituation?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.

And I<br/>\nam really thinking of you and sending you good thoughts.<br/>\n <br/>\nFirst, I would have to say that I think you and your child should see<br/>\nsomeone professionally as soon as possible. A therapist could really<br/>\nbring some insight to what the root of the problem is. I wouldn&#39;t let<br/>\nthe person dwell on unschooling or anything out of this range, a lot<br/>\nof times therapists want a quick solution,  just stick with the<br/>\nsituation that is in front of you. Your son has a lot of anger and<br/>\nright now he is not seeing you as a good person. It doesn&#39;t look like<br/>\nthis will just go away on its own, it will probably just keep coming<br/>\nup and coming up maybe even in different forms.<br/>\n  <br/>\nIf your child is seeing sex as something dirty you need  to find out<br/>\nwhere that information came from. It just may be that he has seen some<br/>\nimages either on tv or online that were really hard core.<br/>\n But it seems to me that he is really sending up some danger signals.<br/>\nI think you could talk about this for a long time and still never get<br/>\nto the core of what is happened in his head. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also have to disagree with someone telling you to apologize. Your<br/>\nson might think you are really guilty of something bad if you keep<br/>\napologizing for nothing. (what would you be apologizing for? having<br/>\nsex? That is NOTHING to be ashamed of or that you need to be SORRY<br/>\nabout. That is what brought that child into this world. Beautiful,<br/>\nconsensual sex should be revered and honored not apologized for. I<br/>\nthink your son needs to know or be reminded that it is a wonderful,<br/>\nbeautiful thing to have sex with the person you love and even some ppl<br/>\nyou don&#39;t;). But also all sex is not the same, there is also dangerous<br/>\nscary sex, molestation, rape, incest. There are appropriate ways to<br/>\nexplain abuse to a child of 10, I explain to my 9 yr old, that<br/>\nviolence can take many forms. And that the victims is never guilty or<br/>\nbad, simply because something bad has happened to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing, have you talked about the fact that he himself is a<br/>\ndirect result of sex and so is everyone he knows!! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is lashing out at you directly, I would think that it is because<br/>\nhe feels safe enough with you to try to defuse and process whatever<br/>\nhas happened and still be in a place of love. Feel good that he knows<br/>\nyou love him enough to support him through this, even if that is<br/>\nunconcious on his part. But his actions are not appropriate, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t apologize and let him call you vile names, I would get him<br/>\nsome help. <br/>\nGood luck to you, and know that you are really supported here!!<br/>\nsuzanne<br/>\n<br/>\n  In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Momma&quot; &lt;southernbelle@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really need some help here.

It&#39;s just a part of<br/>\nour lives.  I remember my mom had our priest talk to my brother about<br/>\nsome sexual issues he was going through.  It helped him to know that<br/>\nour priest had sex (Episcopal priests can marry) and had a sexual<br/>\nlife.

On the basis of what you&#39;re saying, though, here&#39;s what I might do:<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you can actually speak with him, but you could <br/>\ncommunicate.  How would you feel about writing him a note or an email <br/>\nto ask for a truce?  I think I would tell him that I can see he&#39;s <br/>\n**really** upset with me, and that I want to understand better what <br/>\nhis issue is and help him work this through so we can heal our <br/>\nrelationship.  I would tell him that I&#39;m the same person I&#39;ve always <br/>\nbeen and that I love him hugely and am sad to see him in so much <br/>\npain.  I would also ask him if there may be someone else he&#39;d feel <br/>\ncomfortable with to work this through.  I would be sure to apologize <br/>\nfor any way I might have hurt or confused him without my knowing <br/>\n(but, that&#39;s the way I am).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think those actions may at least get your toe in the door, but I <br/>\nreally don&#39;t know.
