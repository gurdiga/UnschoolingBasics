I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen a member of this group for quite awhile but I&#39;m not sure if I <br/>\never posted an intro.  I&#39;ve enjoyed reading and have learned much from <br/>\nall of you wise people.<br/>\nWe are in Florida and as most of you know, last year we had many <br/>\nhurricanes.  The loss of power and internet service made me fall so <br/>\nfar behind with the posts that it became overwhelming to me.  I felt <br/>\nlike I just couldn&#39;t post until I read every email.  That was <br/>\nimpossible, so last week I just decided to delete everything in my <br/>\ninbox from last year and start fresh.  I&#39;m still not completely caught <br/>\nup but comfortable enough to jump in.  The recent thread about chores <br/>\nhas really helped me in particular because it is one of MY hang ups <br/>\nthat I don&#39;t want to continue to impose on my wonderful children.  <br/>\nAlready I have made changes and have freed myself (and them) of some <br/>\nof the stress.  I wanted to thank all of you for helping me with <br/>\nthis.  I&#39;m looking forward to getting to &quot;know&quot; all of you better as I <br/>\ncontinue to evolve in this whole unschooling way of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaggy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10016,"nextTopicId":9743}}
