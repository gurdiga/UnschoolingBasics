If you think about it,<br/>\n&gt; most of us (and a number of preceding generations) were raised and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;schooled&#39; in some basics - naming Presidents and state capitols, knowing<br/>\n&gt; the dates of wars, The Mayflower, yada yada.

They get anxious and end up being wild and out of <br/>\ncontrol. This furthering in laws negative views of them. What&#39;s a <br/>\nloving mama to do?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nWe have found that many &quot;unsupporting&quot; people aren&#39;t unsupportive maliciously; for the most part, they just really want to connect with the child but find that the traditional routes to connection (&quot;What grade are you in?&quot;, &quot;What are you learning?&quot;) are now closed. If you think about it, most of us (and a number of preceding generations) were raised and &quot;schooled&#39; in some basics - naming Presidents and state capitols, knowing the dates of wars, The Mayflower, yada yada. While these are all trivial pursuits, they do give us a common frame of reference, a connection point, that allows us entry into deeper conversation. Most of us were raised that way, for good or bad, and continue to work that way today.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrandparents are no different; they are using their tried and true methods for connecting. The problem is that our kids don&#39;t know the answers to these trivial questions, don&#39;t know what they&#39;ve &quot;learned&quot; in a day, etc. So rather than acknowledge that they need to find a different way to connect (which means undoing years of programming), our relatives will ask our children to change so they can connect. And if that doesn&#39;t work, they&#39;ll question unschooling in an effort to get us to change, all so that they can connect with our kids. This paradigm holds a very might sway.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at it&#39;s heart, I think that most time this behavior comes from a place of good (trying to connect) rather than a place of bad. So we try to help them find other ways to connect - suggesting questions the grandparents can ask that will lead to enjoyable conversations, providing background info on our children&#39;s interests rather than on unschooling, and ensuring they get up-to-date info on what our kids are into at that particular point in time.

However, you are giving a LOT of power<br/>\nto electronics which I haven&#39;t seen to be there with my never limited<br/>\nalmost 9 yr old DS. Yes, he loves his Gameboy, he loves his favorite TV<br/>\nprograms and computer and video games. He ALSO loves running around<br/>\nplaying with toilet paper tubes and sticks and marbles and making rivers<br/>\nand dams with the garden hose and dirt and rocks and such and making<br/>\nsnowballs and sledding and jumping through a lawn sprinkler and swimming<br/>\nand canoeing and making ramps for his little vehicles and watching mud<br/>\ndauber wasps find exactly the right kind of nest mud and picking fresh<br/>\nwild blackberries from the brambles in the back of the yard on a fine<br/>\nearly summer morning. I will say he tends to dislike crayons mostly - he<br/>\nprefers fine point markers, pens, and the like to the fat, imprecision<br/>\nof crayons. Just his own personality - he loves making detailed line<br/>\ndrawings over making colorful fanciful drawings, just his way, which we<br/>\nhonor by making sure he&#39;s got plenty of such pens and markers and lots<br/>\nof spiral bound sketchbooks (they tend to lay flatter and are easier to<br/>\nmanage than perfect bound stuff). When there is no more power ascribed<br/>\nto TV than to a piece of colorful ribbon, it is a FREE choice to<br/>\ninteract with either, or BOTH. He&#39;s just as content to have the<br/>\nelectronics off and play cards or a board game, precisely BECAUSE he<br/>\nknows it is a FREE choice  which he can take up at any time and leave at<br/>\nany time. <br/>\n <br/>\n--Deb<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
