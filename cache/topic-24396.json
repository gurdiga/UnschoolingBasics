I&#39;ve gotten to the point where<br/>\nI just can&#39;t do it any more, because I am sick and tired of being<br/>\nforced to work with children in ways that I know is just not good for<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, however, in order to afford to leave my job and<br/>\nunschool my own children, I do have to work as a tutor.  And I am<br/>\npresently tutoring a girl who is suffering her way through public<br/>\nschool. The mom seems willing to consider homeschooling, but is very<br/>\ndoubtful of herself.  To top it off, the area where we live is a very<br/>\nintense, high-pressure, college oriented area.   I am impressed that<br/>\nthe mom is even willing to take her child out of school, because most<br/>\nparents of high schoolers in this area wouldn&#39;t consider it.  Parents<br/>\nof younger children will, but the parents of kids in high school<br/>\ndefinitely feel that there kids need to be &quot;schooled&quot;, since it is so<br/>\nclose to college.  Although I definitely plan on recommending Grace<br/>\nLlewellyn&#39;s books to the mom, she also needs the reassurance of having<br/>\na place where her daughter can take &quot;classes&quot;.  I want to be able to<br/>\ngive her names of places that are a little unconventional - on-line<br/>\nschools that do not work in the traditional manner, but which will<br/>\nprovide the mom with the comfort that she needs in order to feel that<br/>\nher daughter is being &quot;educated&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; There is NOTHING you can learn in school that you can&#39;t learn OUT of <br/>\n&gt; school.
