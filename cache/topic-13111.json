But  you interpreted the looks to mean a negative thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***Serriously, I have been his parent long enough to do that and I did <br/>\nand he shpowed no interest.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s cool, but what you typed was: &quot;...he has not eaten despite my <br/>\nsuggestions that maybe he needs to do that...&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nYou didn&#39;t type that you had taken him his favorite food and he had<br/>\ndeclined.   And if you did take his favorite food and he didn&#39;t want to<br/>\nstop to eat that&#39;s normal for a person who is in the flow.   Mihaly<br/>\nCsikszentihalyi has written about &quot;flow&quot; and you can google him or read a<br/>\nblurb about his book at Amazon.  The book is called, (I think)   &quot;Flow:<br/>\nThe Psychology of Optimal Experience.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***Mostly I wrote the post not to beliettle him but to illustrate why I <br/>\nmight be nervious and to see if anyone else ever felt nervious or <br/>\nexperianced somthing similer.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou interpreted his focus and actions as abnormal. If his actions had<br/>\nbeen ok with you, if they had seemed normal to you, you wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nposted in that way.   That&#39;s ok.  Moms get nervous sometimes.   People<br/>\nhave tried to help you see that there is nothing wrong with what he did<br/>\nand nothing wrong with his interest in origami.   <br/>\n<br/>\nYou chose to see his interest through a critical lens.   That&#39;s easy for<br/>\nparents to do.  That&#39;s what most parents do.   What&#39;s not easy is looking<br/>\nat ourselves and at why we get nervous if our kids seem not quite as<br/>\nmainstream as we imagine other kids to be.  Look at your happy kid and<br/>\nsee what you can do to enjoy his new found interest *with* him, instead<br/>\nof thinking about why he shouldn&#39;t be interested. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13107,"nextTopicId":13118}}
