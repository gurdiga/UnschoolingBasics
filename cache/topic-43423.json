I wish you the best of luck in your search for a new home.  I live in a small town in central Iowa.  No, my town of 300 does not have what you are looking for, unless you enjoy looking at cornfields as much as I do -lol ;) . However, Des Moines and the suburbs around it may have what your looking for. Good unchooling support, great community colleges and a state college (Iowa State University) within 20 minutes, in Ames.  Des Moines is not a large city if that is the lifestyle your looking for, yet there are alot of opportunities that my family and I enjoy.

At least 6 families that we get together with 1-3 times/week. Several others who are unschoolers, but not radical and some who are looking into it. I actively get the word out to homeschoolers in our area re: RU through local homeschooling yahoo groups. I submit posts re: upcoming conferences and info I think people might be interested in. Thru these groups<br/>\npeople will email me inquiring about unschooling and RU. I send them lots of info and sometimes they are on-board and sometimes they are not. I also started a homeschooling co-op in our area 6 years ago. We meet on a weekly basis with our unschooling friends and some other homeschoolers for activities, crafts,group outings, socializing and support. We have done everything from dissecting frogs to henna tatooing to talent shows to a visit at the local PBS station to<br/>\nmaking wallets and purses out of duct tape to dying yarn and wool with Kool-Aid to maple sugaring to apple picking/strawberry picking/pumpkin picking to a train ride through the Adirondacks to a rock climbing gym.
