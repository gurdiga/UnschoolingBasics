I just had to laugh about the comment in the article about 10 hairbrushes ....thats our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *do* have one of those kids who ...forget a room ....destroys a house in under 5 minutes and he just dosen&#39;t have the mental capacity to understand needs ( or perceived needs ) other than his own. <br/>\n<br/>\nI ended up literally sneaking off for some time to myself and wrote down problems and came back for a meeting with dad and the girls. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of our biggest problems is mornings...dad has to be at work at a certain time, 2 youngers have to be at school at a certain time, oldest likes to stay up late and dosent want to get up in the am, we cant find what we need to get out the door, its chaos, everyone is stressed. Now we take time to get together backpacks and pick out clothes the night before. Oldest goes in her jammies and the girls have 2 sets of brushes . One set in the house and one sits out in the car . I we are running late/cant find the brush then the youngest buckles in her carseat and brushes on the way to school. Sometimes they do nearly all the night before work and sometimes i do it for them ....either way morning go so much smoother and HAPPIER! <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else mentioned grabbing little opportunities .....<br/>\nMy house will probably always be a mess no matter how hard and long I work on cleaning it. Ive learned to let go of a lot and just enjoy the kids but Ive also learned to grab opportunities. my 9 year old would rather chop her own arm off than clean but she loves to cook so on nights that she volunteers to help with dinner i let her do as much of the cooking as she wants and I talk to her while picking up the living room or folding clothes from the dryer.<br/>\n<br/>\nNicole <br/>\n<br/>\nNever play with hot lava in the house ~Alyssa,5<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Fri, 3/20/09, aenclade &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aenclade@...\">aenclade@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: aenclade &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aenclade@...\">aenclade@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Is setting boundaries compatible with unschooling?<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Friday, March 20, 2009, 9:28 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n            All of your replies are very helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI now remember something AS Neil said in his Summerhill book-<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;there is a difference between freedom and license&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a bit confused by this statement but now I think I get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAmanda Enclade<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;aenclade&quot; &lt;aenclade@.. .&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I came across this post by an unschooling mom on a blog called Life<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Learning.org<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; It sounds like something has gone terribly wrong for her along the<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; way...I would love to hear your take on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lifelear\">http://www.lifelear</a> ning.org/ 2009/03/14/ are-setting- boundaries- compatible&#92;<br/>\n<br/>\n&#92;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -with-unschooling/<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Is Setting Boundaries Compatible With Unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; By Lisa - Unschooling Mom<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We are having some boundary issues in our home.

I am not looking for perfection<br/>\nor even a TIDY house. I mean &gt; we are late for things because I can&#39;t<br/>\nfind socks or my keys got put &gt; somewhere or my son doesn&#39;t know where<br/>\nhis game boy is etc. &gt; My husband feels crappy because he works<br/>\nhard all day to pay for our hoe &gt; and comes home and there is jam on the<br/>\nwalls.&quot;  This is definitely something I misunderstood when we first<br/>\nstarted unschooling. I pretty much thought that if you didn&#39;t go along<br/>\nwith pretty much everything they wanted to do, you were impeding there<br/>\nfree expression. I was on another unschooling list, which I won&#39;t name<br/>\nand I&#39;m not on now, where people were talking about there children<br/>\nlosing friends because they were basically being rude, and others agreed<br/>\nthat it might happen in unschooling because other people couldn&#39;t take<br/>\nbeing around someone who had freedom of expression. I was so relieved<br/>\nwhen I found out that this wasn&#39;t the attitude of all unschoolers.  So,<br/>\non the cleaning issue, for awhile I was pretty much letting the house<br/>\ngo. But it made me feel so bad, I just don&#39;t function well with alot of<br/>\nclutter and mess around me. Our couch was getting ruined from spilled<br/>\nfood, etc. I had been realizing that it wasn&#39;t what I needed, and in the<br/>\ncourse of conversations with my mom discussing radical unschooling she<br/>\nbrought up the point that they didn&#39;t seem to care about there<br/>\nbelongings, or too much about other peoples, and I realized she was<br/>\nright.  This was the clincher for me. My husband and I cleaned for a<br/>\nsolid four hours when they were at their grandma&#39;s and when they came<br/>\nhome, my older son, who is four, walked in the door, breathed out a big<br/>\nsigh, and said &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for you to clean.&quot;  After that, the<br/>\nchange in their behaviour was remarkable, they seem so much calmer, and<br/>\nI&#39;m calmer. They don&#39;t help out too much, they&#39;re only four and two, but<br/>\nI&#39;ve developed little techniques. Like if we&#39;re playing something that<br/>\ninvolves moving from room to room, I just  pick up a couple of things<br/>\nthat go to the next room, and I can put them away without interrupting<br/>\nour game. Having a clean house has made such a difference.

They would wait until I was concentrating on another kid, then sidle off, laughing, to go play somewhere else. <br/>\n<br/>\nChanging my attitude did work. I realized I could spend my time whining, or cleaning. Now when there&#39;s a big mess I just say, &quot;Hey, would you please help me pick this stuff up?&quot; and amazingly, they do it cheerfully more often than not! I would never have thought my kids would be helpful like this. For us, I think my respectful attitude reminded them that they really love me and want me to be happy.

I have been examining my<br/>\npart in all of it.<br/>\nThe issues seem small but become very big. Things like we have 10<br/>\nhairbrushes and no one can find one and they know I always keep one on<br/>\nmy dresser so they take it and the its not there when i want it.<br/>\nI have a craft room and I am meticulous about my supplies which are<br/>\nexpensive and hard to organize. Kids feel like making a card and I go in<br/>\nand tops left off markers and they are ruined.. supplies every where.<br/>\nI can&#39;t find my deodorant and it got taken to a sleep over and left<br/>\nbehind, I have some fairly expensive make up and is also disappears.<br/>\nKids bake something because I have just spent half hour cleaning kitchen<br/>\nand looks like bomb went off.<br/>\nAll of the above happens and this is not what bothers me so much- its<br/>\nthe attitude I get when I mention it. Shrug of shoulders or &quot;go buy<br/>\na new one&quot; which escalates.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my take on it. I have been a radical unschooling for almost 11<br/>\nyears. I am going to be honest and say I don&#39;t think it is working<br/>\nfor me anymore. I have written about my marriage jumping off the rails<br/>\nand I have been reflecting back on some of the things I would do<br/>\ndifferently.<br/>\nMaybe I have been &quot;unschooling wrong&quot; .<br/>\nI don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; my kids so chores and I don&#39;t worry about<br/>\nthe state of the house It has always felt beneath me. As a result we<br/>\nhave been living in CHAOS and I think it has undermined the fabric of<br/>\nour family. I am not looking for perfection or even a TIDY house. I mean<br/>\nwe are late for things because I can&#39;t find socks or my keys got put<br/>\nsomewhere or my son doesn&#39;t know where his game boy is etc.<br/>\nMy husband feels crappy because he works hard all day to pay for our hoe<br/>\nand comes home and there is jam on the walls.<br/>\nThe &quot;old&quot; me would have been- hey they had fun smearing jam on<br/>\nthe walls - whats the big deal- but it IS bothering me know. I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow why the paradigm shift.<br/>\nMaybe its because as the kids get older I am seeing a total lack of<br/>\nregard for &quot;stuff&quot; and it filters to not just there stuff but<br/>\nmys stuff and other people stuff if that makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have done my kids a disservice. I have let chaos win. Putting off<br/>\nthings and procrastination has made everything an emergency . I have<br/>\nshown a lack of respect to my life and the&quot;business of life&quot; and<br/>\nthey maybe are picking up on it?<br/>\nAs part if getting our marriage back on track we have been dealing with<br/>\n&quot;crap&quot;. Al the crap that we have avoided because it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nfun. Like house repairs or taking care of a forgotten bill. In short we<br/>\nare owning up and dealing with the consequences of our actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the The kids have sort of been dragged along and there were never<br/>\nboundaries and now there are. I have never believed in punishments but I<br/>\nhonestly have been re-thinking that concept. The other day when my craft<br/>\narea was left a disaster I had her clean he mess up but also sweep and<br/>\nwash the floor . My girlfriend is also an unschooling and she is trying<br/>\nto convince me that this wasn&#39;t a punishment but<br/>\n&quot;consequences&quot; - Just feels like semantics to me.<br/>\nIt could also be that I never had stuff that my daughter thought was<br/>\nappealing and now she does. I did take here out and buy her own make up-<br/>\nbut mine still seems more appealing<br/>\nI feel like my kids take the easy road and short cuts to instant<br/>\ngratification and I have taught them this and not sure where to go from<br/>\nhere.<br/>\nThis post is a but rambling and iut of a stream of consciousness thing<br/>\ngoing on I apologize!<br/>\nI am going to talk with kids over the week about some of the change in<br/>\nour home- like the fact that life will be easier for us if there is some<br/>\n&quot;order&quot; .<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38985,"nextTopicId":39003}}
