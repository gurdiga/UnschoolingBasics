How do you <br/>\ntalk to your 2 or 3 yo about food without it becoming there are some <br/>\ngood foods and some bad.  Since letting go of sweet limitations, that <br/>\nwas really our only problem, I&#39;ve been trying to inform her about <br/>\nfoods and nutrition, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve gone about it in the <br/>\nright way.  A lot of what I&#39;ve been reading talks about not labeling <br/>\nfood as good or bad, but I feel Rachel has come to view sugar as a <br/>\nbad thing.  Maybe b/c in my eyes it still is.  Basically when she <br/>\nstarted eating candy and wanting sundrops we explained that it was <br/>\nokay to eat sundrops but that if you ate too many of them it could <br/>\ngive you a tummy ache and that it wasn&#39;t healthy to eat just sweets, <br/>\nthat it needed to be balanced out with other healthy foods.  We&#39;ve <br/>\nalso discussed how eating them at night can make it hard to go to <br/>\nsleep.  There are times she asks if foods are healthy, and we respond <br/>\nhonestly.  For instance, french fries, not really healthy but it&#39;s <br/>\nokay to eat them everyonce in a while.  Do we need to elaborate <br/>\nmore?  We let her eat pretty much what she wants when she wants, but <br/>\nshe continually asks for sundrops, which even though we give them to <br/>\nher, drives us crazy.  Any thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20584,"nextTopicId":20558}}
