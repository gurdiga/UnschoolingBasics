Negative, and continually abrasive.  I realize these <br/>\nare negative labels, and I try to replace them with more positive <br/>\nones like serious, analytical, expressive, and assertive.  But it <br/>\ncomes down to an issue of respect for other&#39;s feelings, and on <br/>\ndifficult days the negative labels are hard to let go of.  She is <br/>\nonly 5yo, and I know that some of her behavior is age-related, but <br/>\nshe is extreme.  Sometimes the mean looks and sour tone are just too <br/>\nmuch.  I just e-mailed a friend today to ask for prayer because I <br/>\nfeel like I need to apologize for Orion&#39;s behavior/energy after we <br/>\nhave been out somewhere (and worry about it when I leave her with <br/>\nsomeone).  And then I feel conflicted about feeling this way!<br/>\n<br/>\nLike many have suggested, I try to model right behavior and point out <br/>\nto her how she makes others feel, without being punitive. But it is <br/>\nhard. Today she was rude to the friend we were visiting (because she <br/>\ndid not like the limits my friend has for playing in the house), and <br/>\nI told her that Julianne did not appreciate being talked to that way, <br/>\nand she made a nasty face, hands on hips, and stomped her feet. This <br/>\nhad been happening for most of our visit, so I asked her to come sit <br/>\nby me for some time to think.  I asked her if she thought Julianne <br/>\nenjoyed having her over when she talks mean and makes faces?  She <br/>\ncontinued with the mean tone and expressions and I told her that I <br/>\nwould like to hear her apologize, which she eventually did (I did not <br/>\nforce it).  I allowed her to get up when she agreed she was not <br/>\nfeeling mean anymore. I tried to maintain a neutral, non-condemning <br/>\ntone with her, as I try to do most days. But it almost felt like a <br/>\nwasted effort, because I don&#39;t know if it was the right way to handle <br/>\nit, and I&#39;m not seeing lasting results at this point from using this <br/>\napproach (instead of spanking or harshly reprimanding or time-out or <br/>\nthreats).  I wonder all the time if she acts the way she does because <br/>\nshe is modeling me from the past or even now when I don&#39;t realize it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to have faith that she will blossom into a more positive <br/>\nperson.<br/>\n<br/>\nMZ</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163221353,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;zoocrew@...&gt;","profile":"tina010871","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Please share your thoughts and wisdom...","postDate":"1090356160","msgId":2257,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNkazA0MCtucTdlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhiLjEwMDk4Y2FjLjJlMmViZjQ5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2252,"nextInTopic":2280,"prevInTime":2256,"nextInTime":2258,"topicId":2238,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Whatever s troubling you is probably due to any number of things, but s it s NOT the unschooling.

And it can be<br/>\nhard. I know what I am doing is right for us, and I know my kids are good<br/>\nkids. I have a few people that believe in the choices I&#39;m making, many that<br/>\nrespect me in spite of it I think, and some that don&#39;t respect my choices<br/>\nthough they like me personally, and some that just think I&#39;m crazy. I can<br/>\nalso tell you that just because a child is homeschooled or even unschooled,<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t kids with all their quirks and foibles.  If my kids<br/>\nhave say unkind or abrasive things, we talk about it...how it felt to the<br/>\nothers, how to day it differently...when to say something, when not<br/>\nto....all a part of learning. (heck, I know some adults who haven&#39;t learned<br/>\nthis yet!).  And believe me...yours is not the only unschooled child to<br/>\nbehave like this! (I can say this from personal experience!)

I&#39;ve not<br/>\n  really seen too much talk of it anywhere, and am going to do my best<br/>\n  to describe what I&#39;m thinking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As many of you know our family has a combination of educational paths<br/>\n  for the various children.  Two have graduated, two are graduating<br/>\n  public school next year, two are in public charter school and one is<br/>\n  home/unschooled.  I believe the dynamics of our family are relevant<br/>\n  to this quandry.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My question, of course, is about my one unschooled child.  His<br/>\n  history is that he attended K-3.5 in public partnership school.  I<br/>\n  pulled him out at Christmas break.  We did &quot;school at home&quot; for about<br/>\n  a year and have been unschooling for about seven months.  We both are<br/>\n  much happier for it, but those around us know nothing of the<br/>\n  philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I totally agree with the unschooling philosophy and do my best to<br/>\n  practice it in all aspects of my daily living.  It&#39;s wonderful!  The<br/>\n  one &quot;perk&quot; that was not forseen is the fact that I get to do things<br/>\n  that I enjoy.  That&#39;s a whole &#39;nother topic.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  The thing that I am struggling with is negativity.  My son is 10, and<br/>\n  he&#39;s a perfectionist.  He&#39;s not the most polite person around.<br/>\n  That&#39;s the struggle.  He&#39;s quick to notice other&#39;s short comings and<br/>\n  has no quams about saying things.  He says totally what&#39;s on his mind<br/>\n  with no regard to the feelings of those around him.  In my words, he<br/>\n  can be rather abrasive.  He&#39; argumentative and negative regularly.<br/>\n  Has anyone else been through this?  This is something that has been<br/>\n  going on for a while.  It&#39;s not a new concern.  I keep trying to ride<br/>\n  it out, but it&#39;s difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This type of behavior doesn&#39;t seem to be too common with home<br/>\n  schooled children, let alone unschooled.  I know it&#39;s only been seven<br/>\n  months, and it will take much longer for us to deprogram ourselves.<br/>\n  I&#39;ve been not saying too much, but it&#39;s getting more and more<br/>\n  difficult to bite my tongue, and/or control it.  I find myself<br/>\n  getting more concerned about the programs that he watches on<br/>\n  television and the PS2 games that he plays.  He watches<br/>\n  programs/movies and plays games that I know most mothers of children<br/>\n  his age would just think me crazy for &quot;allowing&quot; it, but I&#39;m not<br/>\n  controlling his choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Is there a point when this will seem less worry some?  Are there<br/>\n  things that I could/should be doing to improve the situation?  Am I<br/>\n  worrying about &quot;nothing&quot;?  What are your thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry if it&#39;s not too clear.  This was really difficult to put into<br/>\n  words, but I&#39;d love your thoughts on the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks - Tina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
