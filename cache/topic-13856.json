It started out like a regular scholl panic dream. I was in school, unprepared, looking for classes I had forgotten I signed up for, taking tests I knew nothing about. I used to have those any time i was stressed in real life. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnly this time I stopped in the middle of the dream and said &quot;wait I forgot, none of this matters.&quot; It was sooooo freeing.

Some are pretty much  <br/>\ninstantly recognizable as &#39;junk mail&#39;, but most are messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this dream, my kids and I were walking through a  <br/>\nwasteland...obviously some end-of-world type of thing. We were  <br/>\nscavenging for survival stuff, food, clothes, the little ones were  <br/>\npicking up toys and such. Josh and I were finding books, keeping them  <br/>\nbecause we love to read and we were going to rebuild the library.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne book he picked up was a saxon algebra book, in fact, it was the  <br/>\none he bought for himself at a curriculum sale we attended recently.  <br/>\n(He&#39;s got the knowledge base for it, and is curious, but mostly wants  <br/>\nto do it, I think, to prove that he can. Although he did the first  <br/>\nfew chapters by himself and hasn&#39;t touched it since) We walked for  <br/>\nmiles and miles, balancing everything. Josh had the most trouble  <br/>\nthough, because he couldn&#39;t balance that one book. Finally I grabbed  <br/>\nit from him and threw it over the edge of a cliff! He was shocked,  <br/>\nbut I just said, &quot;you know, it doesn&#39;t matter anymore....it&#39;s okay to  <br/>\nlet it go. In our new life, we have to just realize that some things  <br/>\naren&#39;t as important as they used to be&quot; We ran over to the cliff to  <br/>\nsee what had happened to it, and it was miles below, in a crevasse  <br/>\nFULL of old math books.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just woke up, amazed that I was not able to process that while  <br/>\nawake. But I really feel like I&#39;m taking a huge step internally. Even  <br/>\nthough we&#39;ve been living this for a while, obviously I was still  <br/>\nhaving issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just wanted to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13618,"nextTopicId":13946}}
