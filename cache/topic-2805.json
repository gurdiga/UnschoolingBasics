I bought all three (Reading, <br/>\nWriting and Math) instead of curriculum and just started using them.  <br/>\nMy girls LOVE the games so far, and we are having a blast.  Plus, I <br/>\nfeel reassured as I am seeing some neat things happening as we play.  <br/>\nFor instance, today, we played word charades for the first time using <br/>\nanimal words.  We had a lot of fun!  After the first time around, my <br/>\n5yod wanted to make her own cards, and asked me how to spell bear, <br/>\ndinosaur, cow and elephant.  She recognized all the words the second <br/>\ntime we played.  We also played Word Search and found word cards that <br/>\nwe hid all over the house. I made them with the names of family <br/>\nmembers and we pretended they were lost in the wilderness.  They got <br/>\na kick out of finding grandmas, cousins, and themselves, and begged <br/>\nto play again! And older dd recognized all the words again!<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides seeing learning from these games, we are spending quality <br/>\ntime together, which I have struggled with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn another happy note, my 5yod has been asking how to snap her <br/>\nfingers recently.  The other night she came out of her bedroom quite <br/>\nlate to tell me we need to &quot;get a book from the library on how to <br/>\nsnap so I can learn how to do it&quot;!!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also had an outdoor recorder concert last night, followed by an <br/>\nimpromptu parade with kiddie instruments!<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess the unschooling is going well!<br/>\nMelissa Z.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":159596184,"authorName":"melissazietlow","from":"&quot;melissazietlow&quot; &lt;Zietlowfamily@...&gt;","profile":"melissazietlow","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Nurturing Interests--word play","postDate":"1092760603","msgId":2822,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNmdGM2ciszMzRhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwODE2MjE0NDQ1LjIxNTY3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxNzAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2821,"nextInTopic":2823,"prevInTime":2821,"nextInTime":2823,"topicId":2805,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... whole make learning fun attitude as well-my son LOVES to play with it and mix the words up and play the games.

We haven&#39;t tried MadLibs but I keep eyeing the books.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh and if he likes making songs and poetry and stuff, you can buy (or even make) refrigerator poetry.  They have boxes with magnets with words in it and you mix and match the magnets to make poems and silly sentences.  I know you can buy different sets at Border&#39;s (if you have that chain where you are) but we made our own.  We just got flat magnet stuff from a craft store and we sat over a couple of nights just thinking of all different types of words we might like to play with.  We typed and printed the words out and glued the to the magnets and voila!  A homemade custom version that cost about half the price.  We use it to make silly sentences and even to make messages to each other on the fridge.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere used to be a game with wooden dice and each side had a word instead of a number.  That was always fun though I haven&#39;t found the game again as an adult.  I&#39;m thinking though that maybe that too is something i could make with blocks of scrap wood cut into cubes.  You shake them up and take turns making fun sentences from whatever words appear on the dice.<br/>\n <br/>\nHope that helps,<br/>\n <br/>\nJonni-Ann<br/>\nMom to Joshua age 7 and Jenna age 5 (amateur wordsmiths all) :)<br/>\n<br/>\nmamaaj2000 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamaaj2000@...\">mamaaj2000@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nI&#39;m looking for ideas on things to do with my ds, almost 4.
