Two school years ago Sydney very clearly wanted to<br/>\ntry out public school.  She was almost 7 and thought she was missing<br/>\nsomething.  Very social creature and always wanting to do everything.  I let<br/>\nher and she did not have a good time.  Quit after a few days and I was happy<br/>\nto have her home, and relieved of course, but sneaking in my head was the<br/>\nthought that she really didn&#39;t get whatever it was out of her system.  I<br/>\nfully expected her to want to try again the next year.  Actually she did<br/>\nmention it last year too but not as emphatically and changed her mind in<br/>\nfavor of the myriad activities I had planned for September that she would<br/>\nhave to miss if she were at school.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night we were with some homeschool friends three of which went back to<br/>\nschool last year due to their mother&#39;s debilitating illness.  Mom is better<br/>\nnow, the girls aren&#39;t going back but for some reason they were waxing poetic<br/>\nlast night in the car about all the things they learned last year at school<br/>\nand what a great experience it had been.  (If I didn&#39;t know better I&#39;d think<br/>\nthey were doing a PS advertisement for the teacher&#39;s union.)  Sydney adores<br/>\nthese girls and is powerfully influenced by them.  When we got home she told<br/>\nme she wanted to try school again.  She asked how soon she could go and I<br/>\nsaid, &quot;Well, they usually start in September don&#39;t they?&quot;  She seemed<br/>\nrelieved that I said yes - I think she was ready for a fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year&#39;s tac seems like it worked but I think she did feel a bit tricked<br/>\nand manipulated by it.  I am hoping to approach her this time with as much<br/>\nrespect and kindness as I can muster.  Also, last time she went to school<br/>\npart of the reason she quit so soon was homework.  She did not want to do it<br/>\nand I tried to impress on her that it was required of all school kids.<br/>\nMaybe I should&#39;ve just let her not do it and see what happens. (hmm my past<br/>\nperfect tense isn&#39;t working:0)  It really bothers me because I know that<br/>\nshe&#39;s very smart and she is truly learning all kinds of things all the time<br/>\nbut her reading is not on a school timetable at all. There are all the<br/>\nlittle differences one would expect in a home learner /unschooler.  She is<br/>\nvery likely to be told she is &quot;behind&quot; or to be treated unkindly or made to<br/>\nfeel odd or stupid.  She is rather sensitive about these kinds of things and<br/>\nwhile I respect her desire to find out what she&#39;s missing for herself, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want her damaged by the experienced and I&#39;m so sure that will be part<br/>\nof the result.  (My emails do run on when I&#39;m upset about something:))<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, there&#39;s 20 more pages in my head of relevant information but if<br/>\nyou&#39;ve read this long I&#39;ll thank you by ending it here.<br/>\n<br/>\nKrisula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1528,"nextTopicId":1596}}
