I mean, for ourselves? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can start deschooling the moment you leave school - high school anyway. Some college kids do a certain amount of deschooling while living at college - the get to &quot;deschool&quot; some of the &quot;non academic&quot; stuff at least and you can see it in the all night pizza parties and wild drunken escapades ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people don&#39;t ever quite deschool but carry school with them into their adult lives. That&#39;s part of why school has become the standard of childcare - because too many parents haven&#39;t done enough deschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And, do we unschool with children from birth to six or that is something that starts at &quot;school age&quot;?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been on unschooling lists for close to a decade, now, and &quot;school age&quot; matters. It&#39;s a big, big, big stumbling block for many, many parents who would Like to unschool. There&#39;s a Lot of social pressure to put kids in school - from spouses and friends and extended family, from television and books and music and random strangers in the grocery store. &quot;Unschooling&quot; babies and toddlers is no guarantee a family will unschool past school age. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, depending on where you live there&#39;s also a Lot of pressure to get kids in &quot;the right pre-school&quot; which is just as hard to manage as the &quot;school age&quot; pressure. So to an extent, it depends on  your environment. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also the case that deschooling isn&#39;t something you ever really stop doing, if you&#39;ve been through school, yourself. Even seasoned unschoolers will have pangs of &quot;omg, she&#39;s 12, she should know...&quot; now and again, as personal issues come up in relation to our kids. If Your history is school, then to an extent that&#39;s going to be your means of comparison to your kids. Ray didn&#39;t drive at 16 - still isn&#39;t driving at 18 - and that brings up schoolish worries for me, worries about keeping up with the norm and doing what the other kids do. Mo&#39;s 10, and sometimes I worry that she&#39;s not as savvy about this or that as her age-peers. But those are My issues, not things I dump on my kids - that&#39;s one thing I have learned from unschooling, how to keep my own just mostly to myself. Mostly ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":377201113,"authorName":"mitrisue","from":"&quot;mitrisue&quot; &lt;julesmiel@...&gt;","profile":"mitrisue","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Deschooling self","postDate":"1322232100","msgId":47723,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGphbzlmNCt0bGFuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47722,"nextInTopic":47727,"prevInTime":47722,"nextInTime":47724,"topicId":47719,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
