It was more a <br/>\ncommittment (mostly on my part) to doing things in a very <br/>\npredictable, orderly way/sequence and discuss any changes with Ray <br/>\nbeforehand. *He* had to be free to do things his own way within my <br/>\nroutine.

If he had to hunt for something, he was <br/>\nmore out-of-sorts in general. If he had to hunt for something *and* <br/>\nhe was hungry or tired, it was a lot more likely he&#39;d meltdown. This <br/>\nis waaaay less of an issue nowadays, but some of that may be that <br/>\nGeorge and I are pretty well &quot;trained&quot; at this point, especially in <br/>\nthe kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe with your son you could talk about wanting to have more of <br/>\na routine for yourself and asking for his input. What sorts of <br/>\nthings do you do that he likes? dislikes? For instance, does he like <br/>\nto come and wake you up, or would he rather get up to find mom <br/>\nalready awake and doing something? Does he like to talk about things <br/>\nfirst thing in the morning? right before going to bed? some other <br/>\ntime? <br/>\n<br/>\nThink about your routine as a framework - like a jungle-gym. Meals <br/>\nand check-ins and sleep form the structure, but he can climb in and <br/>\naround and over it, and even jump off if he wants. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":278087315,"authorName":"chis31@primusonline.com.au","from":"chis31@...","profile":"elendil722003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Kelly&#39;s Replies to Seeking Advice/Panic Attack","postDate":"1186794715","msgId":25670,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2OEZGNTdFMDAwMjJBNzJAY3BtczAxLmludC5pcHJpbXVzLm5ldC5hdT4=","inReplyToHeader":"IDxmOWZhMG4rdGZuOUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":25650,"nextInTopic":25676,"prevInTime":25669,"nextInTime":25671,"topicId":25609,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It may be not so much that he needed structure as routine and predictability.

I<br/>\nwanted to add my 2 cents and pose a question or two.   First, though,<br/>\nI&#39;ll introduce myself as I&#39;ve been lurking for months.    We live in MD<br/>\nand have been homeschooling since Oct. 2005.  Thomas had just started<br/>\n3rd grade and the same old junk was happening so he and Ally(1st grade)<br/>\ncame home.  Brian(4) was in a wonderful nursery school and he loved it<br/>\nso he stayed.  If only public schools were like that nursery school. BIG<br/>\nSIGH!    Fast forward to now.  Thomas has decided to return to ps for<br/>\n5th grade.  I don&#39;t want him to but I&#39;m supportive of his decision.  He<br/>\nis a bright kid, and did well, by school standards.  While in school, <br/>\nhis behaviour at home was a nightmare - all the stress from the school<br/>\nday came out as aggression and anger toward us.  He really relaxed as we<br/>\nde-schooled for 4 months and seemed to enjoy our homeschool routine<br/>\n(school-at-home) for a couple months in 2006.  At that point he began to<br/>\nrebel against schoolwork so I researched unschooling, joined a yahoo<br/>\ngroup, did lots of reading and we moved towards the unschooling.   But<br/>\nhe was lost.  Without the structure of a school day he felt his days<br/>\nwere wasted and any attempt on my part to engage him resulted in<br/>\nmeltdowns and lashing out.  He viewed it as me trying to &#39;teach&#39; him<br/>\nsomething.  Honestly, I was trying to help him work through it all - to<br/>\ngive some direction to his day so he wouldn&#39;t feel wasted.  So, I waited<br/>\nfor him to engage me, to ask me to do something.  He always wanted me to<br/>\nread to him, so read, read, read, is what I did.  I felt like I was<br/>\nignoring the younger 2 but they were content to play with each other and<br/>\nwhen they needed me, Thomas was ok with &quot;I&#39;ll be back in 10 minutes.&quot;<br/>\nUsually he&#39;d read ahead in the book and I&#39;d have to catch-up .  This<br/>\nlasted for about 6 months - somedays we&#39;d build Lego or he&#39;d tell me<br/>\nabout his comics.  He&#39;d spend hours on Club Penguin, or he&#39;d read by<br/>\nhimself.  He did a SpongeBob keyboarding game so he could IM his cousins<br/>\nwithout me.  I could tell he was healing.  Then one day he announced<br/>\nthat he wasn&#39;t ever going to do math.  He was going to be a<br/>\ngrocer-bagger because they don&#39;t need math. No problem.  Then he started<br/>\nsaving money for a DS Lite.  He asked how much grocer-baggers made.  He<br/>\nrealized he&#39;d need a better paying job as an adult( I know, far in the<br/>\nfuture, but that&#39;s how he thinks), so he decided to be a chef - &quot;I&#39;ll<br/>\nonly do fractions and measurements!&quot;  He made chicken cacciatore,<br/>\nangelfood cake, beef barley soup, peppermint brownies - nothing easy,<br/>\nand he did it pretty much on his own.  His cooking phase lasted a couple<br/>\nmonths.  Then he got restless again - teasing, bugging, wandering, etc. <br/>\nI didn&#39;t know what to do to help him.  Eventually he told us he felt<br/>\nlike he was stupid, like he didn&#39;t do anything all day, that he was<br/>\nbehind all his friends in school.  He&#39;d cry that he wanted go back -<br/>\nmaybe, maybe not.  Then one day this past  June, he announced that he<br/>\nwas going back to school this fall.  Since he&#39;s made the decision he has<br/>\nbeen much calmer, happier, and settled.  I don&#39;t know how long he&#39;ll<br/>\nstay in school - he hated it!   But he&#39;s made a decision he&#39;s happy with<br/>\nand he leave 5th gr. and come back to homeschooling.     Your comment<br/>\nYou weren&#39;t unschooling. You were just letting him be while you did<br/>\nother things. Unschooling is about trusting that he will learn when he<br/>\nis ready. That INCLUDES reading and math. in response to Tyra&#39;s post<br/>\nreally hit home with me because that was me!  I did let him be while I<br/>\ndid my own thing, but lots of reading (here and various books) helped me<br/>\nto see that.  And now, I do trust that he will learn whatever when he&#39;s<br/>\nready/wants.  He and I have talked about it endlessly, but he doesn&#39;t<br/>\ntrust himself.  How do I get him to that point?    And this one No, he<br/>\nhates being having his mother as his teacher. A very common<br/>\nproblem in school-at-home families. Standards are high, pressure is<br/>\nhigh, and child feels like crap because he can&#39;t please his own mom---OR<br/>\neven complain to his mom and dad that his teacher sucks.  was also true<br/>\nfor us.  My goodness!  It&#39;s painful to realize.  He hated having me as<br/>\nhis teacher - he said so a million times, but I never thought about the<br/>\n2nd part (feeling like crap &#39;cause he can&#39;t complain) Talk about being<br/>\nhit over the head with a sledgehammer!  I didn&#39;t realize how awful it<br/>\nwas for him.  There was no safe outlet for his frustration and anger -<br/>\nwe were together all the time and I was constantly harping on him - poor<br/>\nguy!  And now that I&#39;m  not going to be his teacher, he can love me<br/>\nagain, as his mom - only his mom!  It makes so much sense.  I must<br/>\nremember to talk to him about this when he gets home from camp.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant him to stay in school because it is the lesser of the two evils.  I<br/>\nwant him to come home and enjoy our time together as a family.       <br/>\nthere is a LOT of teaching going on in schools during this time; and<br/>\nsince the students are still in a learning mode, they&#39;ll seem to know so<br/>\nmuch more than your own, unschooled kids. What&#39;s good to keep im mind is<br/>\nthat they aren&#39;t RETAINING much of this! Sure, they can regurgitate a<br/>\nbunch of facts, but it&#39;s not really learning that sticks. our children<br/>\nare *absorbing* HUGE amounts of<br/>\nfacts and figures and ...schtuff! But it&#39;s not yet regurgitable. &lt;G&gt; <br/>\nHere: Schooled kids are *swallowing* the info and spitting it back out. <br/>\nYOUR kids are DIGESTING a lot of the same material---it&#39;s becoming part<br/>\nof them---just like longer bones and more skin and bigger teeth. But<br/>\nyour children&#39;s knowledge won&#39;t show up<br/>\nas....something.....*Tangible*!...until quite a while afterwards.   It<br/>\nhas taken me the past 2 years to understand the truth of this!  How can<br/>\nI help him recognize the truth of this?  Where he realizes that he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t need a school schedule to learn these things, that his schooled<br/>\nfriends only know that stuff  &#39;in the now&#39; but it&#39;s meaningless to them<br/>\nand it was torture for many of them.   I know this is long - sorry!    <br/>\nThank you so much for this group!  I am so fortunate to have you all to<br/>\ngive advice, kick me the butt, pick me up and put me back on the<br/>\nunschooling path.
