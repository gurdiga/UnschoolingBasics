It could help to re-arrange the home so that more of what the kids like to do is close to where you&#39;re preparing food. It could help to plan messy kid-activities for times when you&#39;re going to be doing messy food things, so you can all be making a mess in the kitchen together (and then clean up one big mess rather than several messes). It could also help to involve kids more with food prep, if they&#39;re interested. Some kids loooooove to help with food. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can also help to relax into some prepared foods. I don&#39;t know how much time you spend on cooking - there have been times in the past when I liked to do a lot of things from scratch and I found that I also got my ego tied up in that to an extent, so that when I wasn&#39;t really Wanting to cook so much I still felt like I Should. It took an effort to get past that feeling that I wasn&#39;t as good a mom if I wasn&#39;t cooking from scratch. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;they&#39;ll end up fighting while I cook--or even while preparing a monkey platter<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you prepare foods While they&#39;re eating? That means getting at least one meal/snack ahead of their hunger. The advantage of having food ready before people are hungry is they&#39;re more likely to make thoughtful food decisions - it&#39;s hard to be thoughtful when you&#39;re ravenous! So getting ahead helps in that regard, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can also help to slim down other household tasks as much as you can - such as dishwashing. That might involve using some disposable plates and utensils, or cutting down on the number of dishes so you&#39;re never overwhelmed with dishwashing... or alternately getting even More dishes so you always have the dishwasher running And still have clean dishes.  <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":236403583,"authorName":"sanfrantigger","from":"&quot;sanfrantigger&quot; &lt;serenacli@...&gt;","profile":"sanfrantigger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"logistical puzzle of cooking for everyone","postDate":"1373219184","msgId":49850,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtyYzloZytpaGViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49853,"prevInTime":49849,"nextInTime":49851,"topicId":49850,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... in the family, but it s a different kind of logistical puzzle than what most moms are raised to.
