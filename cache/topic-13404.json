I can so relate.  :)  Despite all the cruddy<br/>\nadvice to the contrary, we continue to nurse.  It gets a bit much for<br/>\nme at times but I know when ds finally weans I&#39;ll miss the whole thing<br/>\nvery much.  I&#39;m starting to miss it already and I try not to think too<br/>\nmuch about it being done with.

Lately I&#39;ve gotten really good at mildly<br/>\nsaying, &quot;we like it and I wouldn&#39;t think you&#39;d care.&quot;  We have had<br/>\nsuch a wonderful closeness because of it.  Still I could really use a<br/>\nbreak.  Really.  *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nBut these are precious moments.  Sliding by at lightspeed.  While<br/>\nwe&#39;re anticipating that next stage and gasping for breaks, this moment<br/>\ntoo shall pass.  And be sorely missed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThink of the day your child no longer wants your help with baths.  I<br/>\nlike what Ren said about being peeved while doing laundry for her mom<br/>\nuntil she realized that all too soon her mom wasn&#39;t going to be there<br/>\nto do laundry for.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCherish.  That word comes to mind.  Even when you&#39;re so tired and need<br/>\na moment.  Cherish the one you have.  Breathers are good.  Have a<br/>\nbreak (even if it&#39;s just a second or two mid-scream), then go be with<br/>\nand cherish.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, zenmomma@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I feel like she wants my attention 24/7 and I&#39;m getting frustrated<br/>\ntrying to give it to her.

For example yesterday we went to the<br/>\npark and she was happily playing in the sandbox with some other, older<br/>\ngirls.  One of the girls had a younger sister, maybe 5 that wanted Rachel&#39;s<br/>\nshovel.  The girl kept asking and even trying to take it from dd.  I asked<br/>\nher if she&#39;d be willing to share her shovel with the girl, but clearly she<br/>\nwasn&#39;t.  She eventually started offering the shovel to other girls there,<br/>\nbut not the one girl.  (This is one of those things that screams vindictive<br/>\nin my mind, that I&#39;m trying to shed.)  I explained to her that if she isn&#39;t<br/>\nwilling to share her toy with one girl it isn&#39;t nice to offer it to someone<br/>\nelse.  I know I need to change my thought process, wisdom please.<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13379,"nextTopicId":1010}}
