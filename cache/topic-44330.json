Thanks for clarifying.  I listen to a podcast where she uses the term quite liberally along with her unschooling discussion. The unparenting philosophy is not personally one to which I subscribe.  I guess I was assuming (perhaps incorrectly) that letting children make their own decisions for themselves fell under that umbrella.  That was kind of what I was getting from the post I was responding to, but again, it is clear to me that I could be wrong.  As I noted in my post, I am new to much of this - as well as the language.  I&#39;ll do my best to pick up on the lingo, but as it is, I am already attempting to choose my words very carefully when posting at all.  I am not a person who likes to incite problems on boards, which is why I rarely post at all in the first place.  Sometimes it doesn&#39;t seem worth the trouble... But I will try to stick to the parameters the best I can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ***...I&#39;m still learning about some of the &quot;unparenting&quot; philosophies,...***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is not an unparenting philosophy list.
