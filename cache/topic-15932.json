Give Deb a bonbon for that wonderful<br/>\nobservation.  I, too, picked up on &quot;something missing&quot; from Leidoff&#39;s<br/>\ncomments, but couldn&#39;t put my finger on it.  I, too, saw it as an<br/>\neither or situation.  Either the child stands and watches the parent<br/>\nbe engaged or the parent stops what they are doing to engage in the<br/>\nchild.  I loved the Continuum Concept and it really spoke to my heart.<br/>\n I dont&#39; remember this particular paragraph, but got a feeling from<br/>\nrereading this that children need to see adults engaged in their<br/>\npassions, not just living to serve them yet not neglecting the<br/>\nchildren&#39;s needs at the same time.  I&#39;ve seen extremes of parents who<br/>\n&quot;follow their passions&quot; at the sake of their children.  the children<br/>\ngrow up seeing mom and dad&#39;s passions as more important than their<br/>\nchildren.  The teacher who spends more time helping her students than<br/>\nher children, the actor who lives on a stage and the children buy a<br/>\nticket to go see their father, the non-profit fundraiser whose<br/>\nchildren only see them at fundraising functions, the parents who spend<br/>\nevery non-working hour at church.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile my mom was a sahm while we were in school she was always<br/>\nengrossed in her own world.  Whether she was going to school, involved<br/>\nin church activities, or creating art, we watched my mother from the<br/>\nsidelines.  Rarely were we invited into the &quot;inner sanctum&quot; to<br/>\nparticipate.  I remember only a handful of times that my mom would let<br/>\nus into her studio to do something and then she would get upset<br/>\nbecause we weren&#39;t as neat as she was.  I have two pieces of clay that<br/>\nI made when I was a teen and those are the only two things that I ever<br/>\nwas allowed to make, yet my mother had her own business where she was<br/>\nmaking various things all the time.  She made the stained glass window<br/>\nat the church we grew up in, yet we were hardly even allowed to watch<br/>\nmuch less help.  She quilted, knit, sewed, wove, spun, and did all<br/>\nkinds of other textiles which I learned not through doing but through<br/>\nwatching.  I did eventually learn how to knit, but it was after much<br/>\nbegging and whining.  Maybe that is why I jump at the chance to teach<br/>\nchildren to knit and am proud that all my kids know how to at least do<br/>\na knit stitch.  I can&#39;t think of a craft or art that I have pursued<br/>\nwhere I haven&#39;t involved the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Freedom vs Neglect","postDate":"1153487192","msgId":15933,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5cWpnbyt0MTZpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQyNy41YzU1MDc3LjMxZjIyNGU5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15932,"nextInTopic":15936,"prevInTime":15932,"nextInTime":15934,"topicId":15932,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It also seemed, to me, to posit an either/or situation: either the parent stays engrossed and the child stays on the periphery or the parent ceases their","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1849375670\">It also seemed, to me, to posit an either/or situation: either the <br/>\nparent stays engrossed and the child stays on the periphery or the <br/>\nparent ceases their activity when the child comes around to do what <br/>\nthe child chooses to do.
