However, the kids admit that they are bummed about missing so many daytime opportunities lately simply because they&#39;ve been staying up all night and sleeping all day.  So, they&#39;ve decided that they want to become diurnal again and want my help in doing so.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it was very late, and I came down to help my son transition to bed.  I was tired and cranky so my first try was rough and bossy, &quot;What are you doing???  You said you were coming to bed after the other show was done.  Don&#39;t you remember that we talked about getting sleep at night so we could be ready for fun stuff during the day...(blah, blah, blah, angry tone of voice, stern face.)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHis response was, of course, resistant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went back up to bed scowling, thinking that I would have to give up and fall grumpily back to sleep.  Then, I somehow released my anger (that he wasn&#39;t listening to me) and fear (that I would never again get a normal night&#39;s sleep, that we&#39;d be stuck at home tomorrow while he slept all day).  Feeling calm I thought I&#39;d give it another try.  So, I walked back to the TV room.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went over to the sofa, started snuggling and gently tickling him.  In a playful voice and with playful words I invited him upstairs.  He responded, &quot;Mommy, I love you so much.  Let&#39;s go to bed.&quot;  Which we did!!!  We went up to our family bed and snuggled down.  He fell asleep in seconds!<br/>\n<br/>\nLetting go of bossy mom and taping into playful mom really helped last night!!!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nA book that I am reading right now is &quot;Playful Parenting&quot; by Lawrence Cohen.  Using PLAY to connect with LOVE is a brilliant approach, I think!  Playful parenting and Un-schooling are a perfect match for me!<br/>\n<br/>\nYAY!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\n<br/>\nElli</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40212,"nextTopicId":8958}}
