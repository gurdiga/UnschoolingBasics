We see it in <br/>\nour own children and in each others&#39; kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember that, the first time I seriously considered unschooling <br/>\nmy children, I felt a big flow of energy inside of me. It was as if <br/>\nI had touched a crucial point, something I HAD to do. For reasons <br/>\ntoo long to explain, it didn&#39;t last, and for months, I couldn&#39;t feel <br/>\nthat vibe again. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m convinced that we have a kind of inner compass, and that we can <br/>\ntell what&#39;s good (at least for ourselves) from what&#39;s not. That <br/>\nthere are such things as intrinsically &quot;good&quot; things - the things <br/>\nthat bring life and joy and togetherness (???)and bad ones - the <br/>\nones that destroy and that split us from our inner self / our kids / <br/>\netc. (That&#39;s the point where I become SO frustrated because my words <br/>\nbetray my thoughts and I&#39;m really afraid of being misunderstood)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my kid began school and did like it ... three days ! I kept <br/>\nsending him, because I didn&#39;t really know what else to do and also <br/>\nbecause I was 8-months pregnant and needed rest (not a very good <br/>\nreason, I agree). As school is only part-time, I became used to <br/>\nspend time with him (since then, I was studying and working, so his <br/>\nsister and him were at daycare) and I started to think again ... <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure that I would be the best mom in town but I&#39;m totally <br/>\ncertain that unschooling, even as difficult as it looks, would do us <br/>\ngood. Like you said, and that&#39;s was were this long speech was <br/>\nsupposed to bring me, it&#39;s a whole, it goes further than just <br/>\nacademics - and I hope I wont be disappointed, because I really <br/>\nexpect quite a lot from this change. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have the feeling that, since my kids were born, I have maintained <br/>\ntwo levels in my parenting, attachment parenting in one hand, <br/>\nand &quot;distance parenting&quot; in the other. I knew that I was <br/>\nquite &quot;adapted&quot; to the mainstream, and I was afraid of trying more <br/>\nradical things, so I did a bit of both and hoped that my kids and I <br/>\nwould find a balance like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that these compromises didn&#39;t work that well. Something <br/>\nprevents me from being the parent I really want to be. Of course, a <br/>\nbig part of it is the way I have been parented myself, the inner <br/>\nvoices I still have, my own anger issues, all these things. But I <br/>\nwonder if there isn&#39;t something else, I wonder if it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\neasier to dive in the big pool than to go back and forth the whole <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell. I can&#39;t put this in words properly. I hope that you got the <br/>\ngeneral idea and, anyway, I thank the people who are still reading <br/>\nmy broken English.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"How it works WAS: Swiss newbie  again","postDate":"1150663858","msgId":14759,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDODYxMzAwOTMyNUQwNC1FRjAtNTY3OEBtYmxrLWQxOC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGU3NDlwOStvYTRqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":14758,"nextInTopic":14773,"prevInTime":14758,"nextInTime":14760,"topicId":14679,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s a process, all right.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Actually, I&#39;m working on it for years now, but it seems so natural<br/>\n&gt; for you and so connected with a whole philosophy of life ...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  It seems that way because we&#39;ve worked really hard at it. Some had to <br/>\n&gt; work harder. It depends on the baggage you&#39;re carrying. Getting rid of <br/>\n&gt; your parents&#39; voices (if they were the same way you&#39;re acting) helps a <br/>\n&gt; lot!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  The more mindful I tried to be, the more mindful I became. I asked the <br/>\n&gt; boys to help me too---if they saw me getting edgy, they could tell me. <br/>\n&gt; That helped me too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I still snap sometimes. I snapped at Duncan this past week, but I <br/>\n&gt; apologized later. He said that was OK---he could tell I was a little <br/>\n&gt; stressed. &lt;g&gt; Sweet boy. And patient with me!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My problem is that, when the pressure is high inside me (and it can<br/>\n&gt; be for very small things), I act in complete opposition with what I<br/>\n&gt; believe is true and good (well, I guess that you already understood<br/>\n&gt; this part).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Do you feel it coming on? You might like to try &quot;Rescue <br/>\n&gt; Remedy&quot;---drops that can lower that pressure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -==-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Concrete examples ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For instance, we are expected somewhere (school for instance, as ds<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t unschooled yet, or doctor, or dinner at my parents) and we get<br/>\n&gt; late. Shouldn&#39;t be a big issue, but for me, it actually becomes one,<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know why. So I can deal with that very calmly (good days) or<br/>\n&gt; I can explode and yell on everybody (bad days).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I hate to be late too. But if you *know* it *could* happen, ask <br/>\n&gt; yourself what would be the worst thing that could happen---you&#39;d be <br/>\n&gt; late? &lt;g&gt; Deep breaths, a few drops of Rescue Remedy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another example : my son can cry in a way that makes me crazy. I<br/>\n&gt; KNOW I shoudln&#39;t, but I can be sarcastic about it (sorry I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; translate what I tell him, but I minimize the reasons that make him<br/>\n&gt; cry) or even tell him that he drives me crazy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Bite your tongue and think what would you do without him. That helps <br/>\n&gt; me a LOT. If he were no longer here, wouldn&#39;t you miss that crying?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hate myself when I do that. For instance, the other day, I picked<br/>\n&gt; him up at school and asked him to do something with me, instead of<br/>\n&gt; waiting for my husband to go home and do it himself. He began to cry<br/>\n&gt; that he didn&#39;t want to - and I became really ... (sorry, can&#39;t find<br/>\n&gt; my words) ... hard, speaking in a very severe tone and quite loud.<br/>\n&gt; After that, I thought that it must have been very hard for him, not<br/>\n&gt; only the fact that I was so unsensitive and selfish and mean, but<br/>\n&gt; also that I did it in front of his friends. I thought that it must<br/>\n&gt; be very hard to have his own mother being so disrespectful (???).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Apologize.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Tell him you&#39;re trying to do better/be better. Ask for his help. If <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re starting to feel out of control, let him know that you need <br/>\n&gt; space or that you are cranky. He&#39;ll keep his distance if he knows <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re edgy! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not very often, but it&#39;s like there are some &quot;blind spots&quot;<br/>\n&gt; where I act in complete contradiction with my strongest beliefs,<br/>\n&gt; where I can&#39;t find the resource to step back for a while.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;ll get better. Keep working.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s why I was anxious to know if, some time, I would be able to<br/>\n&gt; do so even in these occasions. I&#39;m really afraid that these<br/>\n&gt; explosions ruin all the efforts I&#39;m doing the rest of the time (when<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m saying *efforts* ... it&#39;s not always hard, I like being with<br/>\n&gt; them, I find them cool most of the time ;))<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  As to whether you will be able to do so even on these occasions: Do <br/>\n&gt; you want to?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then DO! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  And although you&#39;re not spanking, you might find Pam&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NoMoreSpanking@yahoogroups.com\">NoMoreSpanking@yahoogroups.com</a> e-list helpful.

Alas, I am not evolved enough (or  <br/>\nliberated enough) yet. I am getting better daily, because there is a  <br/>\nseries of things you can do to get better. The first step is  <br/>\nrealizing it is a problem ;-) Which you have done, me too. Then I  <br/>\nmoved to apologizing to my children, rather than trying to justify my  <br/>\nreactions. Now I am happy to say that after months of doing that, we  <br/>\nare finally starting to see me come to the place where at least half  <br/>\nof my poor reactions have disappeared. I still have bad days, and  <br/>\nsometimes still become harsh, but I more often say &quot;Guys, I&#39;m really  <br/>\nstarting to lose my temper, and I need some time to relax!&quot; Or even  <br/>\njust &quot;I AM SO MAD RIGHT NOW!&quot; Which I think is healthy for them to  <br/>\nknow, the important thing for OUR family is letting them know that  <br/>\nthey did not do anything wrong, I just don&#39;t have the tools yet. The  <br/>\ncool thing is that they all know that *I&#39;m* learning too, and I&#39;m  <br/>\nopen to suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving seen all these great changes, I am confident that sooner  <br/>\n(rather than later) I will be mostly gentle mom. But everyone does  <br/>\nhave bad days, and I think it&#39;s important to model how to react  <br/>\nappropriately, and model letting your needs be known. I know other  <br/>\nmoms will have much wisdom here, I am new to this also, maybe eight  <br/>\nmonths, even though I&#39;ve always tried to be an attached parent and  <br/>\nattending to needs, not always the mindful parent that is discussed  <br/>\nhere.<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 16, 2006, at 5:24 PM, seccotine_ch wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Reading you is really like taking a big deep breath of fresh<br/>\n&gt; oxygen ...

I get crabby and hot (I live in Columbia, SC! &lt;g&gt;). I don&#39;t always <br/>\nget enough sleep. I forget to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\n But it gets better and easier every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There&#39;s a lot of tongue-biting and deep-breathing and thinking before <br/>\nreacting. But it&#39;s amazing how much better you get at things when you <br/>\nthink about them and DO them!<br/>\n<br/>\n  My goal is to be a better parent. Not better than other parents. Not <br/>\nbetter than my parents---although that&#39;s certainly possible. But to be <br/>\nbetter than I was. To be a *better* parent. I know I can always get <br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some people will stop at becoming even remotely better than their own <br/>\nparents were. I know lots of those! Or better than the neighbors are to <br/>\ntheir children. But I know *I* can be better than I am *now*---so I <br/>\nwork towards that goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t spank any more (that stopped when Cameron five, I think). I <br/>\nhardly ever yell---and I&#39;m a yeller. I *do* get frustrated and <br/>\nirrational sometimes. But the more aware and mindful you are, the more <br/>\naware and mindful you are! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your children will be older every day---every minute. And if you can <br/>\nstop---just a *second*---before speaking or reacting, you *will* become <br/>\nmore like the parent you&#39;d like to be---the parent you wish you&#39;d had!<br/>\n<br/>\n You can do it!
