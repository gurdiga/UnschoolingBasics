Your arguments are very thoughtful, but I<br/>\nthink you are attacking a straw man.  I don&#39;t want to get in your face<br/>\nand argue with you, but I do want to argue with the idea that kids<br/>\nmust have rules to prevent dire consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding television, my son has had the opportunity all his life to<br/>\nsee television without me trying to control the amount or content.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t see any signs that it has damaged his developing brain, and he<br/>\nis now 13 years old.  That makes it pretty easy for me not to have the<br/>\nsame concerns about television that you do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**For example, consider Maura&#39;s pointing out the impracticality of<br/>\nrounding upthe neighbors&#39; kids to go to a paint ball park. **<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m better at finding solutions within my own family because I have<br/>\naccess to more information about the situation.  Of course we can&#39;t<br/>\nfind the perfect solution for Maura, considering our imperfect<br/>\nknowledge or and our distance from the situation.  But we can generate<br/>\na lot of ideas and encourage her to adapt them to suit her family. <br/>\nGenerating great solutions isn&#39;t instantaneous, and sometimes has to<br/>\ncircle around and be repeated or tweaked or reconsidered.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  I wish I had more time to talk about &quot;rules vs. principles&quot;<br/>\nbecause although I don&#39;t say &quot;I don&#39;t say &quot;NO&quot;&quot;, I do say &quot;I don&#39;t lay<br/>\ndown RULES&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t have fixed limits&quot;.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25399,"nextTopicId":25404}}
