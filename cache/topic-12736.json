I saw this over and over during rape counselling.<br/>\nTeens who had been date raped felt that they owed the boy sex or that they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have a right to say no because they were on a date afterall and he is<br/>\na boy afterall.  They willingly have sex because they don&#39;t know there is an<br/>\noption to say no.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a fifth grade PS teacher I took part in the &quot;sexual misconduct and STD&quot;<br/>\nscare tactic presentation and had to teach human growth & sexuality to my<br/>\nstudents.  I found that when they talk about a percentage of girls and boys<br/>\nthinking rape is okay it&#39;s b/c they use the define by the way Michelle<br/>\ndefined above, which I believe is close to how it is defined legally, and<br/>\nsometimes did not use the term &quot;rape&quot; I think the way most of us perceive<br/>\nrape when we read those facts is characteristic of Michelle&#39;s second<br/>\ndefinition of a violent act.  It&#39;s shocking to me what they know and learn<br/>\nabout sex so young.
