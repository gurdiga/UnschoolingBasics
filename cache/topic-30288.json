You&#39;re still looking <br/>\nat subjects and categories as something that needs to be tackled <br/>\nindividually and in a certain way.  Relaxed homeschooling is <br/>\ndefinitely better than strict, forced homeschooling.  However, <br/>\nrelaxed homeschooling is not unschooling.  My son is 11.5 and has <br/>\nsort of done the same thing as your son as we have transitioned from <br/>\nrelaxed homeschooling to unschooling.  There were subjects he liked <br/>\nbetter than other subjects when we were doing schoolwork at home.  <br/>\nHe was happy to drop the disliked subjects but wanted to keep the <br/>\ninteresting subjects.  In his mind, that was his idea of his choice, <br/>\nchoosing what schoolish subjects to study.  I have helped him <br/>\nunderstand that he&#39;s really free to choose to do or not do any <br/>\nstudies at all.  And he&#39;s not asked to do those subjects one time <br/>\nsince we&#39;ve been unschooling.  He&#39;s still interested in History and <br/>\nScience but he does them in his own way, totally and completely.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, you don&#39;t *need* to do any particular subject.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBeth</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Hi I am new","postDate":"1204166310","msgId":30292,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5MkE5QTI4LTU3RUItNENDOC05QzNCLTI0M0EwQUFGMEVEN0BtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZxNDB0YStwdTlkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZxNDB0YStwdTlkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30288,"nextInTopic":30295,"prevInTime":30291,"nextInTime":30293,"topicId":30288,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Those are easy questions.

From 4-6 we used this, in 7th we switched <br/>\nto a classical curricula, and have used that for 7tha nd 8th (we <br/>\ntried the schoolbook approach and hated it).  I guess we have always <br/>\nbeen child centered learning, if he doesn&#39;t like something we toss it <br/>\naside and move on, if he does we stick to it (even if my &quot;lesson <br/>\nplans&quot; say otherwise).  Ok so now I guess I have gotten even <br/>\nmore &quot;relaxed&quot; as my dear husband says.  I allow our son to study <br/>\nwhat he wants, he has read every magna he can get his hands on, he <br/>\nhas designed his own video games, and he is currently working on <br/>\nmaking claymation movies.  <br/>\nNow I am fine with this, feel that he is learning so well, we are <br/>\nalso switching to organic foods, so he has been looking up what foods <br/>\ncontain the most chemicals.<br/>\nMy husband does like to see things like spelling test and math <br/>\nworksheets.  He also like to throw in a good book or two for him to <br/>\nread, but does not require any reports, he says just tell dad about <br/>\nit.  Right now he is to read The Hounds Of Baskerville.  <br/>\nWe have never tested formally in our school work, as we do not <br/>\nbelieve in testing, yet our state does require some type of test <br/>\nscores or teacher thing at the end of the year (Ohio) so we use the <br/>\nCAT/Survey test through Seton Home School.  I do not time him though, <br/>\nI feel that it puts stress where it is not needed (I do glance at the <br/>\ntime, and he is well within the time limit).  He scores very well on <br/>\nthese test, so I really am not worried.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk now here are my questions.......<br/>\n<br/>\nShould we use a spelling text and vocabulary, he loves learning new <br/>\nwords?<br/>\n<br/>\nShould we use a math book, we have been studying algebra, he hates <br/>\nit, we are moving on the geometry I think, just not sure what books <br/>\nto pull from (he loves geometry)?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow should we do English?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much for all of your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30294,"nextTopicId":30283}}
