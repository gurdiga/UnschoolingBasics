Am I using the wrong language when I say<br/>\n  limits?...do some kids need a little extra guidance when it comes to<br/>\n  these things? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think you&#39;re on the right track, I think the difficult thing is to<br/>\n  see where a<br/>\n  limit is truly potentially harmful and when it&#39;s just a kneejerk<br/>\n  reaction<br/>\n  because &quot;we have to&quot;. (NOT)<br/>\n  Usually, there is a way to redirect truly destructive behavior by<br/>\n  understanding<br/>\n  their motivation. If your child wants to paint themselvs green and<br/>\n  streak naked,<br/>\n  maybe the yard would be an ok place, rather than the street.:)<br/>\n  And if you are really bothered by children writing all over the<br/>\n  walls, you could<br/>\n  designate certain walls for just that purpose, or their rooms. There<br/>\n  is this<br/>\n  great stuff at paint and hardware stores now, it&#39;s paint-on<br/>\n  chalkboard and dry<br/>\n  erase board, so you can turn any wall in your house into instant<br/>\n  art! Very cool.<br/>\n  We&#39;ve also purchased window markers and let them go to town on every<br/>\n  window in<br/>\n  the house..my was THAT colorful.<br/>\n  I think the key is taking their interest seriously, even if it seems<br/>\n  strange or<br/>\n  destructive, it&#39;s a NEED at that moment in their lives, we need to<br/>\n  find a safe<br/>\n  way to help them do it. And the more they know we are their<br/>\n  advocates and we are<br/>\n  here to help them get where they need to go, the more they trust and<br/>\n  really<br/>\n  listen to us.<br/>\n  I have yet to see sugar be truly harmful unless a person has a true<br/>\n  health<br/>\n  issue. The problem with children and sugar, is not the sugar, it&#39;s<br/>\n  the lack of<br/>\n  protein sometimes. Protein helps keep your blood sugar balanced when<br/>\n  you ingest<br/>\n  sugar...so helping them be aware of when they might need some<br/>\n  protein is much<br/>\n  more desireable than limiting sugar in my opinion.<br/>\n  My three year old wanted ice cream first thing in the morning<br/>\n  yesterday. I still<br/>\n  have these programmed responses (that fortunately stay in my head<br/>\n  and don&#39;t get<br/>\n  to my mouth most of the time) that I have to be aware of, so I&#39;m<br/>\n  chanting in my<br/>\n  mind &quot;it has the same ingredients now as it does at 3pm&quot; over and<br/>\n  over<br/>\n  as I scoop it up for him. He ate it all, then opened the freezer,<br/>\n  pulled out a<br/>\n  piece of chicken breast and said &quot;cook it chicken Mom&quot;.<br/>\n  He knows what he needs already.<br/>\n  Sierra will turn down candy for brocolli.<br/>\n  Trevor will refuse most chocolate, unless it comes on a Twix bar.:)<br/>\n  Jared will ask me to cool a &quot;real&quot; meal after they&#39;ve had a binge of<br/>\n  sugar.<br/>\n  They also choose to eat things that make my health-freak self<br/>\n  cringe, but I<br/>\n  trust that they will find their own balance. And if these foods are<br/>\n  just choices<br/>\n  among many, it will not seem more desirable.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Keeping a child from running on a busy street is doing for them what<br/>\n  they would<br/>\n  WANT us to do if they understood the danger. They don&#39;t understand<br/>\n  and we ARE<br/>\n  here to keep them safe. I have to ask myself &quot;why not&quot; when my kids<br/>\n  come up with some bizarre idea, and usually find a way to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then there&#39;s the issue of boundaries. I hugely believe in respecting<br/>\n  people&#39;s<br/>\n  boundaries and helping my children understand that issue. Another<br/>\n  person&#39;s<br/>\n  property is not something up for grabs, we need to have their ok<br/>\n  before doing<br/>\n  anything to it.<br/>\n  Picking flowers from a neighbors garden is not ok without their<br/>\n  permission, but<br/>\n  a young child can&#39;t possibly understand the issue of personal<br/>\n  boundaries....SO,<br/>\n  I&#39;d go buy them some flowers of their own, or ask the neighbor if we<br/>\n  can pick a<br/>\n  few, or go on a walk to pick wildflowers, or help them grow a little<br/>\n  flower<br/>\n  garden or something to fulfill the need.<br/>\n  Once we get past all the rules and &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; stuck in our heads,<br/>\n  we<br/>\n  can begin to think more creatively and honor everyone&#39;s needs and<br/>\n  interests.<br/>\n  Sure, there are real life limits. I&#39;m here to help my child<br/>\n  creatively navigate<br/>\n  those and to not add more limits that aren&#39;t necessary.<br/>\n  Some are.<br/>\n  We have to be especially mindful and comfortable with our children<br/>\n  being who<br/>\n  they are in order to figure out the times that a limit exists for<br/>\n  real reasons,<br/>\n  and when it&#39;s just arbitrary or because society frowns upon<br/>\n  individuality.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Learn about unschooling at:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
