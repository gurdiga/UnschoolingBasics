Where we live <br/>\nright now, the people I am closest to and who accept us the most are all <br/>\nLDS (and we&#39;re lesbians!). They are great and love the kids, but there <br/>\nis a barrier there because their religion just does not move me.

in school, it was all about the relationships and activities for me and the work and assignments just happened.  I was extremely social and there were lots of sports and activities that my school time was centered around.  I learned way more from all of the extra-curricular stuff that I did (and all of my family and outside experiences-working, etc.) then I did in my classes.  I really felt like my school was such a supportive community for me and I can&#39;t imagine anywhere that would have been better for me-at least that my family had access to.  I learned so much even from the few negative experiences that I had in school and I really feel like I made a positive difference in my schools and in many of the lives of the teachers and students.  Afterall, school was where I made many lifelong friendships (two that married into my<br/>\n family), and I met my dh in highschool.  School was also where I participated in the following activities:  student council, competive and supportive cheerleading, basketball, track, softball, soccer, marching band, flag corp, flag football, symphony band and lots of committees.  I wish that there was an adult &quot;school&quot; that had all of these activities still : )<br/>\nAll of that being said:  continue unschooling your daughter!  I would just look at school as another learning experience that you are providing for her.  I still feel like I was fairly &quot;unschooled&quot; even though I went to school.  Trust your daughter that she needs to learn something about school and then she&#39;ll decide-it could be the best thing she ever did, the worst thing she ever did, or most likely just something she did and learned from.<br/>\nI hope this helps you see another perspective on all that school CAN be.  The important thing is that you know your daughter, and you know how to help her make the best of her experience.  Be her partner and go into it with thoughts of possibilities- it&#39;s a new ADVENTURE- and who doesn&#39;t love that!  Try to understand your anti-school thoughts and fears as your daughter prepares to draw her own conclusions.<br/>\nBTW:  Our 5 yo has been asking to go to school too (and not just ANY school-a very expensive Montessori school).  I have been sorting through all of the same emotions for about 3 months.  We&#39;ve been trying to be sure that there isn&#39;t some other need that isn&#39;t being met, so we&#39;ve been checking into all kinds of possibilities.  He is VERY social like me and enjoys being around older kids and adults, so I&#39;m not sure how much school would meet his social needs.  We have yet to make a decision and we have only one month to figure out what we are going to do (and how we&#39;re going to get the money!). <br/>\nJeanette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":304745245,"authorName":"Judy R","from":"&quot;Judy R&quot;

I do try to tell them what it&#39;s likely to be like without at the same time being super discouraging - <br/>\n<br/>\n  But of course the ultimate sad thing is that *isn&#39;t* what it should be - and they certainly aren&#39;t used to getting up at the crack of dawn to be at school by 8:15 am! <br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, just to let you kow that yours isn&#39;t the only one!

Imagine the moms wanting to introduce the kids to Ren  <br/>\nFaires and you wanting to enrich the kids lives with hip hop culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s very similar to the new-to-unschooling question of what if the  <br/>\nkids want to watch cartoons and the parents want them to watch  <br/>\neducational shows? What if the kids want to play video games and the  <br/>\nparents want them to play outside?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer is: you embrace cartoons, you embrace video games. You run  <br/>\nnew things through their lives that they might like and let them pick  <br/>\nit up if they want. You get to know them and find things that support  <br/>\ntheir immediate interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I see is you trying to pull them away to do what you value. Why  <br/>\ndoes there need to be a choice? Rather than narrowing their lives to  <br/>\nthe cultures you value, why not embrace all cultures, including hip hop?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For example, we&#39;ve been studying the<br/>\n&gt; Middle Ages and went to a Renaissance Faire a few months ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Introducing things you think they&#39;ll enjoy is an important aspect of  <br/>\nunschooling. But once we&#39;ve introduced something, then the kids get  <br/>\nto be the directors. How much more stuff we give them is up to their  <br/>\ninterests.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome unschooled kids might enjoy &quot;studying&quot; some chunk of the world.  <br/>\nIf it&#39;s an interest of theirs, they might enjoy someone presenting a  <br/>\nchunk the person thinks is really cool. But central to unschooling is  <br/>\nthe kids&#39; freedom to say &quot;Done with that. Let&#39;s do something else.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a round about way of saying that if you picture unschooling as  <br/>\nthe parents joyfully exposing the kids to important things the  <br/>\nparents think the kids will like and the kids joyfully following,  <br/>\nthere will be snags when the parents are valuing the direction more  <br/>\nthan the kids are (or more than the kids themselves).<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about supporting the kids&#39; interests. Part of the  <br/>\nsupport is directly feeding their interests. Part of the support is  <br/>\nalso introducing things we think they&#39;d enjoy. A central part of the  <br/>\nsupport is backing off and letting them decide how far and how deep  <br/>\nand what direction they want to go (even if it&#39;s a direction that  <br/>\ntakes off away from what was introduced).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My kids seem to be<br/>\n&gt; wanting to fit in with a media-derived idea of hip hop culture that<br/>\n&gt; values only bling, babes and bustin&#39; heads.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And if they feel you pulling them away, it&#39;s just a fact of human  <br/>\nnature that they&#39;ll hold on tighter. And the harder you try to turn  <br/>\nthem to what you value, the less they&#39;ll want to turn. The more you  <br/>\ninsist what you value is more important than what they value, the  <br/>\nless they&#39;ll value what you want them to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat last is vital. The easiest path to kids valuing what we value is  <br/>\n*not* to head there directly. The best place to begin is by valuing  <br/>\nthe kids and supporting what they value. By supporting them, you  <br/>\nbecome someone who is worthy of their value and respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it. If you&#39;ve got an interest, who would you rather be  <br/>\nwith: someone who says &quot;Ew, ick, don&#39;t like that. Here&#39;s what&#39;s  <br/>\nreally important,&quot; or someone who found delight in the fact that you  <br/>\nfound something that delights you?<br/>\n<br/>\nLet them be the guides through hip hop culture. Be open! Embrace it.  <br/>\nPark your comments at the door. Find out what they like about it. Do  <br/>\nway more listening than telling. If you feel like interjecting your  <br/>\nvalues, picture how jarring it would feel as you&#39;re sharing an  <br/>\ninterest with your wife and she focused on her view and how wrong she  <br/>\nthought your view was. Picture how joyful it is to share with someone  <br/>\nwho, even if they don&#39;t get it, is enjoying your enthusiasm.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And, no, I&#39;m not ignorant of hip hop. I know what you&#39;re seeing.  <br/>\nJust as parents look at Grand Theft Auto and see a culture and values  <br/>\nthey reject, but not the fun it can be to safely play in a world  <br/>\nwhose values you&#39;d never want to embrace. Just as parents see what  <br/>\nMarilyn Manson appears to be embracing and not the power to reject  <br/>\n(or whatever the *kids* like, which might just be the music and not  <br/>\neven the lyrics.) Experience it through the kids&#39; eyes.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be the same with the kids&#39; mothers. You can begin a tug of  <br/>\nwar between you with the kids as a rope. But it can&#39;t be a tug of war  <br/>\nif you&#39;re not pulling back. The more you&#39;re on their side, the more  <br/>\ninfluence you have. Rather than trying to be the leader, walk by the  <br/>\nkids&#39; side.

I told her I was<br/>\nstill on her side, that I do and would support whatever choice she made. I<br/>\nasked if she wanted to talk to me and that I would listen without criticism.<br/>\nShe did. we talked about her needs and all the stuff we are going through as<br/>\na family. We talked about how her needs would fit in with going to school<br/>\nand other options. We talked (I mostly listened) about where she was in her<br/>\nhead right now and what she needed from me and in general.<br/>\nI think you were all right and I knew this in my heart, what she really<br/>\nneeded was for me to say (and mean) that I was 100% behind her. To lay all<br/>\nmy bullshit down and just be there for her. I don&#39;t think she really wanted<br/>\nto go to school, she needed attention. We talked about how to met her needs.<br/>\nI also let her know that I was still there for her. I agreed with her that I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been giving her enough for a couple months (since we moved). I had<br/>\nperceived that she was happy with running about and playing with kids all<br/>\nday then vegging at night. Apparently she wants to be around me more<br/>\n(yeah!). I am glad that she still feels like she can talk to me even though<br/>\nI did fuck up (yelling and crying).<br/>\nI listened to this audio I found on Sandra Dodd&#39;s page the other day. What<br/>\nreally hit home for me was she talked about her sister complaining all the<br/>\ntime and little things. How everything was the last straw...I feel like that<br/>\nis where I am right now. So I am working on unloading straw. I also talked<br/>\nabout this with my dd11. I wanted her to know that I am aware that I am on<br/>\nedge and that I am trying to let go and be more present.<br/>\nSo we made a list of her needs and desires. We discussed ways to met them<br/>\nregularly. It was good to write them down because I think she feels like I<br/>\ntook them really seriously (I am a list maker). We made several plans. She<br/>\ndecided that she wanted to do too many things that would conflict with a<br/>\nschool schedule but still wants to go just to try it with the option of<br/>\ngoing full time if she likes it. She was also concerned about how much<br/>\nfreedom would be inhibited if she went to school. She gets to do what she<br/>\nlikes with her time now and didn&#39;t realize that teachers tell you what to do<br/>\n(gotta love Disney) and when to do things. I let her know that if/when she<br/>\nchoose school we would unschool school. I am not sure if that is a good way<br/>\nto word it but that we would become like other parents and rake away<br/>\nprivileges or control her or her experience. She seems really relieved. I<br/>\nthink she feel s freer to make a real decision now. There is still several<br/>\nweeks left, she is very impulsive so there is no telling what she will<br/>\nultimately want. She is a free spirit and very confident and sure of herself<br/>\nand very intelligent so I have let go that she will be hurt by her<br/>\nexperience if she goes. She asked a bunch of thoughtful questions and I<br/>\nanswered them with facts and left out my opinions unless she asked me and I<br/>\ntold her my school experiences without much drama.<br/>\nAnyway, I know that I just want her to be happy and lead a full life, if<br/>\nschool is what she needs then I  will help make that happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, I see what you are saying. I wasn&#39;t being very approachable. That was<br/>\nthe biggest issue. I have been very on edge lately. I still think her home<br/>\nexperience is good. I don&#39;t think we have a bad unschooling house. There is<br/>\nstill freedom, love, respect and much joy. I am doing my personal best at<br/>\nbeing a gentle, mindful parent. I know that I could improve and I am trying.<br/>\nWriting about my thoughts and experiences are helping. Just unloading my<br/>\nbaggage on here with you guys meant so much. I didn&#39;t have to give it to my<br/>\ndd, I could sort through it and throw stuff out before it got to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, Jul 5, 2008 at 2:30 PM, Marie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cpc2@...\">cpc2@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   We&#39;re in the same boat.

Reading about unschooling on <br/>\nSandra Dodd&#39;s site and this and other lists, I&#39;m growing by leaps and <br/>\nbounds. Just trying to articulate some of the challenges I perceive in <br/>\nmy family, I realize things about myself and my parenting style that <br/>\nhelps me change. My mother was very uptight and controlling and I am <br/>\nmore that way than I want to be! The idea of &quot;anything goes&quot; excites and <br/>\nchallenges me. I want to learn how to be a good parent without <br/>\n&quot;micromanaging&quot; my kids&#39; every move, but I have some questions about how <br/>\nthis might work.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy basic situation is this:<br/>\nMy partner has sole legal and physical custody one of her daughter&#39;s <br/>\nchildren, due to mental illness. The daughter has visitation rights. The <br/>\nmother and one of her sisters got involved with brothers, who happened <br/>\nto be black. They each had three kids who are all very close (if you put <br/>\nall 6 of them in a line you can&#39;t tell the siblings from the cousins). <br/>\nBoth women (now 29 and 30) continue to be involved with black men and <br/>\nthe aunt says she is &quot;black on the inside&quot;, but their understanding of <br/>\nblack culuture seems to me to be really mostly from the outside: <br/>\nmedia-derived definitions based on rap, hip hop, celebrities, etc. The <br/>\ndads are out of the picture, although the aunt has subsequently married <br/>\na different black man.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy concern was that the mom, aunts and cousins undermine my attempts to <br/>\ngive the three I&#39;m raising more richness in their lives. They go beyond <br/>\nunsupportive and into obstructive. For example, we&#39;ve been studying the <br/>\nMiddle Ages and went to a Renaissance Faire a few months ago. Before we <br/>\nwent the kids were reluctant because they heard their aunts/cousins say <br/>\n&#39;only nerds go to Ren Faires.&#39; Any thoughts about what to do when <br/>\nextended family/social group undermines unschooling values?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is true: &quot;Because we are social creatures, we do not require <br/>\ncoercion (or threats) in order to want to fit in, and so to undertake <br/>\nlearning to fit in,&quot; (from: Un/Homeschooling © Sara McGrath <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.suite101.com/suiteu/\">http://www.suite101.com/suiteu/</a> ??? un/homeschooling???) then what can <br/>\nwe do when the family social group is anti-learning? My kids seem to be <br/>\nwanting to fit in with a media-derived idea of hip hop culture that <br/>\nvalues only bling, babes and bustin&#39; heads. Their mom, aunts and cousins <br/>\nencourage this and deride anything that challenges it or goes beyond <br/>\nthose values (bling, babes or bustin&#39; heads). None of the mom/aunts have <br/>\ndone much with their lives beyond TV/video games/trying to look &quot;hot&quot; <br/>\nthemselves. I would like at least the 3 kids I&#39;m helping to raise to <br/>\nhave the opportunity to have richer, fuller lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts would be welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\nRobin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":299902014,"authorName":"Emilie Rugard","from":"Emilie Rugard &lt;erugard@...&gt;","profile":"breathemama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] going to school","postDate":"1215275986","msgId":34359,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDgwNzA1MDgzOG8xNjE3YTU0N29lMjIwZDdjMzFmZDA4YjlhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY28gbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDgwNzA1MDgzOG8xNjE3YTU0N29lMjIwZDdjMzFmZDA4YjlhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34358,"nextInTopic":34360,"prevInTime":34358,"nextInTime":34360,"topicId":34352,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I identify with your post even though I am, truthfully, not in your position.

I see myself in your desperation and perfectionism. I want <br/>\nyou to see that it is just that, - *your* desperation, *your* <br/>\nperfectionism. Your daughter is just curious and wants to try <br/>\nsomething new. She is unschooling perfectly. She should be curious <br/>\nand want to try something new.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel the same way when my 4 year old muses about school. And boy, <br/>\ndid I feel that way yesterday when my 2 year old called me a mean <br/>\nmama. None of my three age seven, four or two has ever said anything <br/>\nlike that to me. And honestly, I was heartbroken (for a minute:) )<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just had nursed her most of the night, as I do every night and <br/>\nhave for at least one, and often two of my children for the last <br/>\nseven years. I told her I needed a break to go pee and that she <br/>\nneeded her pooey diaper changed anyway. She was enraged. &quot;mean mama! <br/>\nmean mama! &quot; she said as she hit me. I was flabbergasted and <br/>\nmomentarily heartbroken. I was furious with the older girls for <br/>\nteaching her this phrase, which they had never directed at me and was <br/>\nonly used in a game. I am doing everything for them,  breastfeeding <br/>\non demand, child led weaning, unschooling, cosleeping, consenual <br/>\nparenting, non-violent communication, etc,. And still my baby thinks <br/>\nI am a mean mama.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I was over it in a flash. But this is where my mind goes, <br/>\nto this contract that I have in my head that if I do this or them, <br/>\nthey should do -blank- for me. Be it not want to go to school, not <br/>\ncall me a mean mama, not become a religious fundamentalist, etc,.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my children, and your children did not sign this contract. They <br/>\nare just living their lives, being curious and wanting to try new things.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou haven&#39;t screwed up because she wants to do this. You did screw up <br/>\nwhen you freaked out. But kids seem to accept that their parents <br/>\nmomentarily lose their minds from time to time. At least mine do, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalm down. You&#39;ll get another chance to talk to her about it and next <br/>\ntime you&#39;ll do better.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s her life. She just wants to live it. School sounds pretty <br/>\nexciting until you actually have to go there every day. Maybe it <br/>\nwon&#39;t stick. Maybe it will.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue autonomy in our children is beautiful. Let yourself see the <br/>\nbeauty in her decision. She is not too afraid of school to want to <br/>\ntry this. And she is not too afraid of you to tell you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour cup looks half full to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmilie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":220041937,"authorName":"hbmccarty","from":"hbmccarty &lt;hbmccarty@...&gt;","profile":"heathermccarty1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] going to school","postDate":"1215275728","msgId":34356,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4NkZBMkQwLjUwMTAxMDFAdHdjbnkucnIuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDgwNzA1MDgzOG8xNjE3YTU0N29lMjIwZDdjMzFmZDA4YjlhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDgwNzA1MDgzOG8xNjE3YTU0N29lMjIwZDdjMzFmZDA4YjlhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34355,"nextInTopic":34357,"prevInTime":34355,"nextInTime":34357,"topicId":34352,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Faith- I have been there.

When my older son first told me he was interested in <br/>\nattending school(at age 11)-I reacted similarly at first- I felt angry <br/>\nand fearful and felt as if he were rejecting what I had to offer. I <br/>\nfound that in order to allow him to become clear and make the right <br/>\nchoice for him I had to totally let go of ALL of that and be able to <br/>\nreally listen to what he felt and needed at the time. It wasn&#39;t about <br/>\nME- it was about him. My daughter is now 11 and is going through <br/>\nsomething similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you have a lot going on- perhaps it has become difficult <br/>\nto meet her needs. Kids needs change too and it seemed to me at this age <br/>\nthat my kids were/are really looking for something new and challenging- <br/>\nthis is when my son started playing the bass(he now calls himself a <br/>\nmusician(I agree!), plays for hours each day, plays for several groups, <br/>\nI drive him around tons and we have paid for many lessons, made many <br/>\ncalls, pursued many options, and purchased a lot of equipment- just as <br/>\nan example). We also got involved in a learning center which does meet <br/>\nhis social needs. Maybe if you really can&#39;t meet her needs, then school <br/>\nwill be a good solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat really hit me is that kid&#39;s needs don&#39;t lessen as they approach the <br/>\nteen years, they just change. Once I accepted this, life became more <br/>\njoyful again. I feel as close to my son now as I ever did and for a <br/>\nwhile there(11-12) things were pretty tense.
