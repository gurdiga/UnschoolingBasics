He knows that it is possible to surf <br/>\nand he&#39;s seen us do it - he just has no interest in roaming the Web at <br/>\nthis point - partly, I think, because he doesn&#39;t see a need to, since <br/>\nhe has access to the things he wants and free range to find more with <br/>\nour help if he wants it - and we proactively find things for him to <br/>\ncheck out (as you are doing). Plus, surfing does require a bit of <br/>\nspelling and he just has little interest in that at this point. One <br/>\ntime he was on a site that also had a pay-to-play section.
