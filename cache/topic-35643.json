Before I went out and found people in the area, this group was my way to relax and learn, and truly felt like having a good and inspiring time with friends. <br/>\nEven now, that we have made many friends in the area, I still go to this group for inspiration and to check in from time to time. Now I have felt the wish to document some of our journey in the unschooling lifestyle and since Unschooling Basics has been so paramount in this process I would love to have a chance to meet - and possibly interview and film - people on this list that will be at the Live and Learn conference. I have looked at the schedule, and for me either thursday morning after 10:30 before lunch or friday morning after 10:00 would work for me.<br/>\nFrom what I can gather it seems that Heaton Hall, 1st floor is mostly available. Please let me know if anyone would love to meet and participate -<br/>\nFrom what I understand, Kelly, you started this conference also in the wish to meet people from this list?<br/>\nSome of you know that I will be filming some footage in the hopes of showing it on German TV in combination with a lot of filming on the German homeschooling movement. For this particular shoot I mostly like to interview young people, and hope to find them around. <br/>\nIn addition to that I would love to make an inspiring and fun short movie on Unschooling Basics, the online group, it&#39;s stor, as well as the concepts, so any and all participation in this is highly welcome!!!<br/>\nA lot of you guys are probably on the road already, I will be hopefully posting a meeting somewhere.<br/>\nAll the best,<br/>\nMara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35603,"nextTopicId":35681}}
