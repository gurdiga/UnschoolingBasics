We both have an ideal in our minds of what style<br/>\nwe are looking for (and both of us have different styles).  We are<br/>\nboth quite busty, so finding clothes (particularly shirts) is not<br/>\nalways so easy to begin with and then when you have this idea of what<br/>\nyou want nothing else will do.  We spent 5 hours one day just looking<br/>\nfor plain spaghetti strap tank tops and plain coordinating t-shirts.<br/>\nWe both did a lot of whining that day (commiserating whining).  We<br/>\nwhined about the stupid fashion industry having an unrealistic model<br/>\nof what they think womyn&#39;s sizes are.  We whined at merchants for only<br/>\ncarrying limited quantities in larger sizes.  We whined at store<br/>\nemployees who showed little compassion in helping us find what we were<br/>\nlooking for.  We whined about it being hot (not at anyone in<br/>\nparticular - it just didn&#39;t improve our moods any!)   We whined at our<br/>\ngenes for giving us such odd shaped bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnytime you want a shopping partner to commiserate with come on down.<br/>\nI&#39;ll take you to every shoe store in town 3 times if I have to and<br/>\nonly whine if we don&#39;t stop for lunch :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle - who has solved her shoe delimna by only wearing crocs<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nMichelle Leifur Reid<br/>\nYOUR Pampered Chef Consultant<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nCheck out my homeschool cooking classes!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92643757,"authorName":"Leslie530@aol.com","from":"Leslie530@...","profile":"lescather","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"whining, was Will it ever be enough?","postDate":"1156949447","msgId":16954,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJmOC4yZDRkZDdhLjMyMjZmZmM3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16956,"prevInTime":16953,"nextInTime":16955,"topicId":16954,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/30/2006 9:51:21 A.M.

It&#39;s a lament rather than a simple <br/>\nacceptance of fate and  can be an indication of a strong spirit rather <br/>\nthan a broken  one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*****I want to agree with this, strongly!  Especially the expectation  part.  <br/>\nI see in my own children (and now myself), a very vivid imagination  where <br/>\nthe desired thing is so real in their minds.  They see themselves  playing with <br/>\nthe toy, performing a particular action and in my case, wearing a  certain <br/>\npair of shoes.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen that doesn&#39;t come through....for whatever reason.....there is likely  to <br/>\nbe disappointment.  That disappointment will be shown in a variety of  ways, <br/>\nincluding whining.  Validating goes a long way here &quot;you were really  looking <br/>\nforward to playing with that toy, I&#39;m sorry we can&#39;t get to the store  today&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son went through a period of believing if he wished on a star that  <br/>\nwhatever he wished for would manifest in his bedroom.  That was a rough  time for <br/>\neverybody.<br/>\n <br/>\nNo one ever wanted to go shoe shopping with me, that fantastic pair that I  <br/>\nsaw so vividly in my mind just did NOT exist!  I didn&#39;t want anything else.  <br/>\nAnd when I did finally resign to the fact that I still needed a pair of shoes, I <br/>\n would have to go back to every single store probably more than once to find  <br/>\nthe ones that were the least offensive.  By the way, I am rarely like this  <br/>\nanymore and if I am, I can do it on my own time and not depend on others to  <br/>\ndrive me or get involved.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16925,"nextTopicId":16955}}
