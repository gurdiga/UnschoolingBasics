I&#39;ll update this soon, but here&#39;s what I have now. It&#39;s a good start.<br/>\n<br/>\n~K<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling Basics?<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is trusting the child to learn what he needs to learn when <br/>\nhe?<br/>\n<br/>\nneeds to learn it. Unschooling is also sometimes called &quot;natural <br/>\nlearning&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nand &quot;child-led learning&quot; . But mostly unschooling is NOT school-at <br/>\nhome: we do?<br/>\n<br/>\nnot try to replicate school in our houses. It&#39;s real living in the real?<br/>\n<br/>\nworld---for and with a purpose. You cannot live and not learn---we&#39;re?<br/>\n<br/>\nsurrounded by real opportunities every day to learn. And it&#39;s REAL <br/>\nlearning,?<br/>\n<br/>\nnot simulated as in school. Living is learning is unschooling is living <br/>\nis learning is?<br/>\n<br/>\nunschooling.....?<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several good books on the inanity and insanity of schools and <br/>\non?<br/>\n<br/>\nthe marvels of unschooling.?<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer <br/>\nin the?<br/>\n<br/>\n70&#39;s who came to realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most <br/>\npopular?<br/>\n<br/>\nbooks are How Children Fail, How Children Learn, Teach Your Own, and <br/>\nLearning?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the Time.?<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year. He <br/>\nfinally?<br/>\n<br/>\nquit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely behind?<br/>\n<br/>\nunschooling. His two big books are Dumbing Us Down and The Underground?<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory of American Education.?<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank Smith has a great little book called The Book of Learning and?<br/>\n<br/>\nForgetting that shows how little one learns in and remembers from <br/>\nschool. He?<br/>\n<br/>\npushes REAL learning---for a purpose.?<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards shows the total inanity of EXtrinsic?<br/>\n<br/>\nmotivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of INtrinsic?<br/>\n<br/>\nmotivation (learning because it&#39;s FUN!).?<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nGrace Llewellyn&#39;s The Teenage Liberation Handbook (How to Quit School <br/>\nand?<br/>\n<br/>\nGet a REAL Education) is the &quot;bible&quot; for unschoolers. It&#39;s a great read <br/>\nfor?<br/>\n<br/>\nteens, but parents should read it too. Be SURE not to skip the &quot;cute <br/>\nlittle?<br/>\n<br/>\nstory&quot; at the beginning. Grace also hosts the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; <br/>\nin?<br/>\n<br/>\nthe early fall for teen unschoolers---a place to meet other unschoolers <br/>\nand share?<br/>\n<br/>\npassions and interests.?<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Griffith has two books, The Homeschooling Handbook and The <br/>\nUnschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nHandbook. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for <br/>\ndocumenting?<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat&#39;s being learned; and, since that is a requirement in several <br/>\nstates, it&#39;s very?<br/>\n<br/>\nhelpful. But The Unschooling Handbook is THE handbook for new <br/>\nunschoolers. In it she?<br/>\n<br/>\ngives real life examples and explanations. VERY understandable. <br/>\nConvinced my?<br/>\n<br/>\nhusband that what I was suggesting made sense! &lt;g&gt;?<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert has two: And the Skylark Sings with Me and Homeschooling <br/>\nand the?<br/>\n<br/>\nVoyage of Self-Discovery. Both are witty---and easy reads.?<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie Fitzenreiter has a brand new book that I highly recommend: The?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnprocessed Child: Living Without School. It&#39;s about unschooling her?<br/>\n<br/>\ndaughter, Laurie. I give it as gifts a LOT!?<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nMagazines:?<br/>\n?<br/>\nConnections E-zine<br/>\n<br/>\nLife Learning Magazine<br/>\n<br/>\nLive Free Learn Free E-zine<br/>\n<br/>\nGrowing Without Schooling, originally put out by John Holt.

There are other wonderful posters, but <br/>\nthese are all radical unschoolers who all have great ways of expressing <br/>\nthemselves and getting to the nitty gritty of unschooling.? <br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd is a radical unschooler of three children. <br/>\nShe has her own website that is chocked FULL of essays and stories about?<br/>\n<br/>\nunschooling.

She&#39;s been deschooling since she <br/>\nleft school in June (well, probably before that, I didn&#39;t push her to <br/>\nbe &quot;perfect&quot; (meaning that as a &quot;school&quot; word, not mine! - re: <br/>\ngrades, reading books etc) while in school and I can see some healing <br/>\nalready.

It <br/>\nincludes many of the things I&#39;ve collected since I started reasearching <br/>\nhomeschooling 2+ years ago and was led to unschooling and it&#39;s nice to <br/>\nsee it again, especially for anyone who may be new to this site.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a great place for newbies to unschooling to ask questions, or <br/>\njust absorb until you get a feel for what unschooling is about, but I <br/>\nhighly recommend checking out the sites of the long time unschoolers <br/>\nmentioned and the books (READ READ READ!).   It took me a while to &quot;get <br/>\nit&quot; but once I did, there&#39;s no turning back!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m coming to this with a child who just finished 6th grade.

Unschooling is also sometimes called natural ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-922441617\">Unschooling Basics<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is trusting the child to learn what he needs to learn when <br/>\nhe<br/>\nneeds to learn it. Unschooling is also sometimes called &quot;natural <br/>\nlearning&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;child-led learning&quot; . But mostly unschooling is NOT school-at <br/>\nhome: we do<br/>\nnot try to replicate school in our houses. It&#39;s real living in the real<br/>\nworld---for and with a purpose. You cannot live and not learn---we&#39;re<br/>\nsurrounded by real opportunities every day to learn. And it&#39;s REAL <br/>\nlearning,<br/>\nnot simulated as in school. Living is learning is unschooling is living <br/>\nis learning is<br/>\nunschooling.....<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several good books on the inanity and insanity of schools and <br/>\non<br/>\nthe marvels of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer <br/>\nin the<br/>\n70&#39;s who came to realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most <br/>\npopular<br/>\nbooks are How Children Fail, How Children Learn, Teach Your Own, and <br/>\nLearning<br/>\nAll the Time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year. He <br/>\nfinally<br/>\nquit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely behind<br/>\nunschooling. His two big books are Dumbing Us Down and The Underground<br/>\nHistory of American Education.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank Smith has a great little book called The Book of Learning and<br/>\nForgetting that shows how little one learns in and remembers from <br/>\nschool. He<br/>\npushes REAL learning---for a purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards shows the total inanity of EXtrinsic<br/>\nmotivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of INtrinsic<br/>\nmotivation (learning because it&#39;s FUN!).<br/>\n<br/>\nGrace Llewellyn&#39;s The Teenage Liberation Handbook (How to Quit School <br/>\nand<br/>\nGet a REAL Education) is the &quot;bible&quot; for unschoolers. It&#39;s a great read <br/>\nfor<br/>\nteens, but parents should read it too. Be SURE not to skip the &quot;cute <br/>\nlittle<br/>\nstory&quot; at the beginning. Grace also hosts the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; <br/>\nin<br/>\nthe early fall for teen unschoolers---a place to meet other unschoolers <br/>\nand share<br/>\npassions and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Griffith has two books, The Homeschooling Handbook and The <br/>\nUnschooling<br/>\nHandbook. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for <br/>\ndocumenting<br/>\nwhat&#39;s being learned; and, since that is a requirement in several <br/>\nstates, it&#39;s very<br/>\nhelpful. But The Unschooling Handbook is THE handbook for new <br/>\nunschoolers. In it she<br/>\ngives real life examples and explanations. VERY understandable. <br/>\nConvinced my<br/>\nhusband that what I was suggesting made sense! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert has two: And the Skylark Sings with Me and Homeschooling <br/>\nand the<br/>\nVoyage of Self-Discovery. Both are witty---and easy reads.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie Fitzenreiter has a brand new book that I highly recommend: The<br/>\nUnprocessed Child: Living Without School. It&#39;s about unschooling her<br/>\ndaughter, Laurie. I give it as gifts a LOT!<br/>\n<br/>\nMagazines:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Life Learning Magazine&quot;<br/>\n?Live Free Learn Free?<br/>\n&quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;, originally put out by John Holt.

There are other lists that &quot;say&quot; they unschool; these are <br/>\nthe radicals who KNOW what they are talking about.

If you have<br/>\nquestions after reading for a few weeks, then post---but most things <br/>\nhave been<br/>\nexplained before, so if you read, you&#39;ll run across the answers to most <br/>\nof your<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome posters to pay attention to are Sandra Dodd, Joyce Fetteroll, Pam <br/>\nSorooshian, Anne Ohman, Ren Allen, Deb Lewis, Rue Kream, Robyn Coburn, <br/>\nDanielle Conger, and Mary Gold. There are other wonderful posters, but <br/>\nthese are all radical unschoolers who all have great ways of expressing <br/>\nthemselves and getting to the nitty gritty of unschooling. They will <br/>\nall be at the conference in October.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd is a radical unschooler of three children, 18, 15, & 13. <br/>\nShe has her own website that is chocked FULL of essays and stories <br/>\nabout<br/>\nunschooling.

L&L welcomes anyone with an interest in unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince its inception in 2001, L&L has supported families that have made <br/>\nthe decision to unschool as they face difficult questions and <br/>\nchallenges. These families may wonder about socialization, or <br/>\nintegration of John Holt&#39;s educational philosophy into their everyday <br/>\nlives. Some families may doubt their abilities, feel confused and ask <br/>\nthemselves, &quot;Can I really do this?&quot;.
