That&#39;s geometry!&quot; &quot;That <br/>\nskateboard move was all about physics!&quot; (and I&#39;d tell him which law he <br/>\njust tried to defy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a slow learner. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I don&#39;t do that.

He hated reading! Books had bad meaning for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he read and wrote IMs for hours at a time. He looked things up <br/>\nonline constantly. He researched all sorts of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI counted those things as reading and writing and literature and <br/>\ncomposition for my records. He never knew any different.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he journals and writes poetry and is writing his speech for this <br/>\nyear&#39;s Live and Learn Conference. He&#39;s never without a book in his <br/>\nbackpack, car or bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had to find that joy for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think he realizes he is learning anything when he plays on the <br/>\nnet.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s learning anything &quot;educational&quot; on the &#39;net! &lt;G&gt; <br/>\nHe probably knows he&#39;s learning. It just doesn&#39;t look like school, so <br/>\nit&#39;s &quot;good&quot; learning. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs parents, it&#39;s our job to see the learning that is already happening. <br/>\nAt first it takes some work, but it gets easier and easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they&#39;re moving up levels on video or computer games, we *know* <br/>\nthey&#39;re learning *something*! Otherwise they&#39;d still be at the same <br/>\nlevel! &lt;G&gt; It may be hard to define what they&#39;re learning; but in order <br/>\nto level up, they have to be figuring out strategies, reading, <br/>\nunderstanding sequencing, following directions, making informed <br/>\ndecisions, using logic, developing mapping skills, ---and a bunch of <br/>\nother things I can&#39;t even think of now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good for us to know all that---and even to document it, but we <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to let on that we know what&#39;s happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt DOES help, though, if the *child* starts having doubts about what <br/>\nhe&#39;s learning. We can say, &quot;Well, from gaming, I know you&#39;re learning <br/>\nthis and this and this.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240269281,"authorName":"squeakybiscuit","from":"&quot;squeakybiscuit&quot; &lt;squeakybiscuit@...&gt;","profile":"squeakybiscuit","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"opposed to learning","postDate":"1205246260","msgId":30717,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZyNjVmbCs1N3NmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYyMDI0NC44ODExNC5xbUB3ZWI4MTQwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":30688,"nextInTopic":30728,"prevInTime":30716,"nextInTime":30718,"topicId":30688,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My kids have done schoolwork off and on throughout the years, and one of my sons has also adopted an additude of not wanting to do anything that looks like","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1351753089\">My kids have done schoolwork off and on throughout the years, and one <br/>\nof my sons has also adopted an additude of not wanting to do anything <br/>\nthat looks like learning.
