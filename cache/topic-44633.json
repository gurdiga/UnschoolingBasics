And somewhere in getting those things done you might squeeze in a load of laundry.   You can have a powerful sense of accomplishment from fulfilling the needs of your children, even if the bathroom is messy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your priority until now has been a well ordered home, I can understand how hard it is to let go of some of that.   Think about the things that really matter to you and do those things and let other stuff go.  <br/>\nFind a way to get one of those things done in the morning while the children are still sleeping or at some other convenient time.  Get tools or cleaning aids that will make the job you want to do easier and faster.    Do one or two things today and one or two tomorrow.     Think of your home maintenance on a monthly or weekly scale instead of a daily one.  If laundry gets done once a week, consider that a success.  If the bathroom gets cleaned up a little once week, count that an accomplishment. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the day when you&#39;re tired, resist thinking about what didn&#39;t get done.  Think instead about how happy your children are.   How they delighted in your attention, how they laughed when you all did a silly dance, how they enjoyed a romp in the yard.   Count those as important things crossed off your to-do list.  Stop counting the things that aren&#39;t there, that don&#39;t get done, as the important things.  Look at what did get done - The children laughed!  The toys were loved!  The day was full of sweetness!  In fourteen years you won&#39;t look back and remember that on August 13, 2010 the windows didn&#39;t get washed, but the sound of your baby&#39;s laughter or the little song your happy four year old sang will stay with you forever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell you from this end, my child all grown up, that a dirty house when he was two and three and four makes no difference to the world now.   No one remembers that a shower curtain got slimy or that the only clean spot on the floor was where the dog licked up the spilled spaghetti.  None of us could name the year the dishes always sat for three or four days before I got to them.   But we can all name the year of the big hole in the backyard, the summer of the squirrels, the Brio train track all through the house, the bowls filled with flour and dinosaurs on the kitchen table, the chains in the bathtub.   Those remembered things still bring joy to all of us.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Deschooling myself","postDate":"1281703159","msgId":44652,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NkRGNjZCQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":44651,"nextInTopic":44654,"prevInTime":44651,"nextInTime":44653,"topicId":44633,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So, for example, while sitting with the baby <br/>\nbird and your children watch them and listen to them and everytime you find your <br/>\nthoughts moving toward something else, moving toward your list of things you <br/>\nwished were getting done, bring it back to the baby bird and your son and your <br/>\ndaughter. Keep your eye on the prize of being with them fully and in the most <br/>\nengaged way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon and Linnaea were 4 and 1 once, they were 5 and 2 and 6 and 3 and so on and <br/>\nso on. Now they are 13 and 10 and they are the ones who wander off from my <br/>\nengagement. Not all the time and they are delightfully supportive of my <br/>\ninterests, although Simon did wrest the ukulele from my hands yesterday when I <br/>\nwas playing Meatloaf&#39;s 2 out of 3 ain&#39;t bad a bit too loudly. The horrible fact <br/>\nof a lifetime is that it is like sands through the hourglass, it moves forward, <br/>\nit shifts away from you. And while I have just been trying to fathom an article <br/>\non how physicists can&#39;t seem to come up with a reason for time being <br/>\nuni-directional, in my day-to-day experience it just keeps flowing inexorably <br/>\none way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is easy to feel a need to do something more and greater and bigger, but in <br/>\nthe end, nothing is really more and greater and bigger than watching a big lorry <br/>\nat a building site or helping a baby bird. Rough and ready garden&#39;s are good. <br/>\nOurs is the most amazing bramble mine, the blackberries will be fantastic, and <br/>\nthe hedgehogs really do love it and it gives the mice a place to hide when the <br/>\ntractors come (of course the cats do decimate them quite handily and then the <br/>\ndog rolls on their guts &#39;cause nothing is quite as nice as eau de dead mouse, <br/>\nbut, well...). A tidy garden has fewer things to engage you and entice interest. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at the glow in their cheeks, the smiles, the curls of their hair, little <br/>\nhands, little milk moustaches, or squash, or whatever it is that they like to <br/>\ndrink. Smell their heads, touch their arms, do the physical things that can pull <br/>\nyour interest, your focus back to them. Distraction is an easy thing, focus is <br/>\nthe trick. When all is said and done, when they have moved away from wanting to <br/>\nbe with you, engage with you, talk and giggle and play with you, what do you <br/>\nwant to get to look back on?

However, your question about deschooling yourself interested me very<br/>\nmuch.  I also have had a very hard time staying in the moment, letting our<br/>\nlife flow.  But when I do, it&#39;s so amazing!  What has been freeing me from<br/>\nmy expectations and rigidity has been movement.  I have always been very<br/>\ncerebral, and intensely verbal.  I was also (I thought) active and fit.<br/>\nWhen I was pregnant I broke my leg, and the resulting inactivity and eating<br/>\nbroke my body down.  I started doing yoga, and out of that emerged a<br/>\ncore-based, intuitive dance that is changing my life!  For me, it was body<br/>\nthat had to unlearn all its rigidity, and once my body found freedom my mind<br/>\nhas followed!  For the first time in my life I&#39;m interested in drawing and<br/>\ncolor and I&#39;m able to immerse myself in play with my two year old son for<br/>\nlong, sustained periods, and, as has been noted on this list lately, this<br/>\nmindfulness results in my son, who feels &quot;filled up&quot; with attention, is<br/>\nwilling to give me time to write or dance or cook.  Though he is only two-<br/>\nand a half, when we are dialed into one another it even seems like he<br/>\nintentionally makes room for me when he senses I need it.  Yet at other<br/>\ntimes, when I was not as mindful, I wasn&#39;t even able to go to the bathroom<br/>\nwithout him right there, climbing on my lap and trying to pull me off the<br/>\ntoilet!  Likewise with preparing meals, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur life has a beautiful flow to it, with one activity growing out of<br/>\nanother, and all kinds of amazing synchronicity.<br/>\nThis new world, of shape and movement and color, is also a much needed<br/>\ncounter to my intellectual life, which has formerly driven me, at times,<br/>\nover the cliff!  I never thought I could move or think the way I am<br/>\nbeginning to now.  I am also able to tolerate a great deal of external<br/>\nchaos, which completely overwhelmed me before. For the first time I am<br/>\nexperiencing joy!<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, we&#39;re still learning, or &quot;unlearning&quot; and I get stuck still.  But<br/>\nthis is how I have broken through.<br/>\n<br/>\nSasha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thu, Aug 12, 2010 at 12:38 PM, Caroline Gallear &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:carolinegallear@...\">carolinegallear@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m after some ideas to help me relax and I guess deschool myself a bit<br/>\n&gt; more...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the surface, I think we probably look pretty unschooly, and on the rare<br/>\n&gt; day, I&#39;ll wake up in a good mood and really enjoy working with what my<br/>\n&gt; children need and going with the flow.

Lists can help. Put all the little details that you do without thinking on a list, like: shut all the cabinet doors, and: refresh snack plates. Add another check-mark each time you do them. Maybe that will help you see all the little things you do as things getting done. I read some study, once upon a time, that found checking things off a list creates a sense of satisfaction.
