Have read and read for years","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1392560467\">Joanne.  Hi.  LOL.  I love how you put it.  Detoxing.  That is what <br/>\ndeschooling seems like to me.  I&#39;m new to unschooling myself.  Have<br/>\nread and read for years but am just now doing any real transitioning.<br/>\n{Yay! --- You&#39;ll see what I mean by that.}<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday dh and I conflicted after ds hit me on the head with a wooden<br/>\n<br/>\ntrain toy.  I was dozing on the couch and ds was trying to get my <br/>\nattention.  I was mad because pain does that to me but wanted to<br/>\ndiscuss <br/>\nit with ds without distractions in order to make sure he understood<br/>\n--NO <br/>\ndon&#39;t hit people.  At the same time dh was mad at ds and wanted to have<br/>\n<br/>\na few words.  After I disagreed, dh went off at me about playdough on <br/>\nthe floor which bugs the fire out of him.  I said we are confusing the <br/>\nissue and it is looking to ds like I am at fault when things go wrong<br/>\nif <br/>\ndh talks about side issues like playdough, and that I want ds to know <br/>\nnot to hit people.  That was all said in the moment.  I managed this <br/>\ntime to keep my head and stay with the issue without delving into side <br/>\narguments.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh has not read indepth on unschooling or gentle parenting (and I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t insisted).  Later on I said I need dh to either trust what I&#39;m <br/>\ndoing in avoiding what comes &quot;naturally&quot; (the way I was raised-- <br/>\nspanked, shamed, coerced, you name it) and soaking up info about gentle<br/>\n<br/>\nparenting which dh agrees to in principle OR get up to speed and parent<br/>\n<br/>\nwith me because ds is 2 and obviously needs us now.  For the first time<br/>\n<br/>\never, dh actually said &quot;ok.&quot;  A breakthrough.  Today dh has been <br/>\nfollowing my lead on a few things and supporting what *we&#39;re* doing as <br/>\nparents together.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Heidi that kids are only little once and we either play <br/>\nwith them or miss the boat.  Sometimes try to beat him to it and ask if<br/>\n<br/>\nhe wants to play tag.  He would probably enjoy you asking him.  My ds<br/>\nis <br/>\nnot 3 yet and incredibly active, even more than when he was a younger <br/>\ntoddler.  I&#39;m sure he&#39;s only getting started.  He absolutely LUVs <br/>\nactivity.  Sedentary, that&#39;s me.  It&#39;s pushing me and I figure boning<br/>\nme <br/>\nup for when ds is much stronger like 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I read in bed a while as ds crawls around on me and finally<br/>\nsettles <br/>\nto nurse and sleep.  He&#39;s getting the message that settle down routine <br/>\nis here to stay.  He dozed off around 1AM last night.  I used worry <br/>\nabout it but now I&#39;m used to it. Sometimes it&#39;s 3AM before sleep comes<br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree it takes time to learn to listen to your body and me and dh<br/>\nstill have a way to go on that one OURSELVES.  We aren&#39;t settled on our<br/>\nnatural rhythms.  I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s because bedtimes and wakeup<br/>\nwere<br/>\nenforced our whole childhoods.  We&#39;re both very resistant and<br/>\nrebellious <br/>\nabout it and also have a way to go about not accepting fussiness from <br/>\none another about it.  The same with food and tv control or any other <br/>\nkind of control.  Baby steps.  We will get there.  It&#39;s amazing how <br/>\nover-controlled children turn into bothered adults.  At least that&#39;s my<br/>\n<br/>\nexperience, if my perspective is right.  In any case, it doesn&#39;t do<br/>\nwell <br/>\nfor modelling to ds.  So yet another thing we need remedies for.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t have much advice on this one except sometimes we do have to <br/>\n&gt; buck up because the kids are only little once and there will be a <br/>\n&gt; day when you wish you could play tag again.  The other thing is to <br/>\n&gt; talk, talk, talk so that he understands your need to settle down <br/>\n&gt; after dinner.  I have that problem later in the night.  I need to <br/>\n&gt; read before I fall asleep, it is my way to settle down.  My kids <br/>\n&gt; know that when it comes around 10:00 mom is in her room settling <br/>\n&gt; down and if they need something they should probably ask before <br/>\n&gt; then.  We have been through it enough times that they just know <br/>\n&gt; now.  I usually do the 1/2 hr reminder, &quot;okay, mom is headed to the <br/>\n&gt; bedroom, anyone need anything before I settle down?&quot;  Of course, <br/>\n&gt; they know if there is something important, that they can&#39;t handle on <br/>\n&gt; their own, I will be there. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Remember too that it takes time for kids to listen to their bodies <br/>\n&gt; and to recognize what they need and how to go about getting it when <br/>\n&gt; they have been told what to do and how to do it before.  They learn <br/>\n&gt; a lot from our model too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!
