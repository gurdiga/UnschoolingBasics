I know some people feel very <br/>\nstrongly that it is not respectful to limit a child&#39;s choices while <br/>\nothers don&#39;t see it that way. Do we have to continue battling this?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****<br/>\n<br/>\nHi there,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been lurking to learn on unschooling lists for a couple of years now.  <br/>\nI went into lurkdom WAY back then after seeing the tongue lashing other <br/>\nhopeful but naive unschoolers-to-be got on the unschooling discussion list...scared <br/>\nme silly, so I learned to just read and evolve quietly.  I want to add that I <br/>\nLOVE this new list...thanks Kelly, Rue, Ren (and whoever else was involved in <br/>\nstarting it)!<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway,  I find that by reading the threads on various topics I&#39;m &#39;getting <br/>\nit&#39; (trust) more and more.  At first, I thought I could just unschool on the <br/>\nlearning parts, and still keep the control of bedtimes and sweets, processed, <br/>\njunk foods.  I thought *that was part of being a good mom...controlling the <br/>\nthings that I thought *I* knew better than Em.  However, the more I read, the more <br/>\nI feel my ideas changing..  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, *I* find the threads on bedtimes and foods extremely helpful since these <br/>\nare the situations I have had a hard time completely letting go of.  It&#39;s a H <br/>\nU G E pardigm shift for me, who is really into organic, nutritious foods, but <br/>\nthe more I read, the more I&#39;m able to wrap my brain around the idea...now to <br/>\nbe able to DO IT!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can already see that by modeling eating healthy and providing healthy (as <br/>\nwell as not) Emma (5) IS beginning to make choices that *I actually feel good <br/>\nabout a lot of the time..and they are HER choices, not my nagging &#39;have to&#39;s&#39;.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve relaxed more about the sweets and not-so-nutritious foods, but I know I <br/>\nhave a ways to go.  But I also do recognize by relaxing my ideas about food, <br/>\nour lives are so much more pleasant.  I&#39;m beginning to see that all the whining <br/>\nand arguments related to them as totally and completely unnecessary....as <br/>\nwell as unfair and even unkind of me :(  <br/>\n<br/>\n*For me*  I really DO WANT unschooling to become  more of a way of life, <br/>\nenveloping ALL aspects of our families lives, not just the things that could be <br/>\npegged as &#39;learning&#39;.  The broader &#39;definition&#39; of unschooling resonates with <br/>\nme, and I really feel if I can just let go, it&#39;ll mean our family will grow in <br/>\nour connectiveness...but I just haven&#39;t quite gotten there when it comes to <br/>\nfood and sleep.  But I keep reading and trying, reading and trying to get there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried putting out all the halloween candy last year (from a thread on <br/>\nunschoolingdiscussion) and it was devoured in 2 days by my then 4 year old....I got <br/>\ncold feet :-/ and backed way off in that I didn&#39;t &#39;display&#39; all the sweets, <br/>\netc.   I haven&#39;t been able to make that huge leap of faith that eventually it <br/>\nwould subside.  But I am working on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway, I just wanted to PLEAD :)  don&#39;t move too far from the whole life <br/>\nunschooling threads.  I still need &#39;those&#39; conversations!  I&#39;m in the middle <br/>\nof my metamorphosis here!!  : )<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nDenise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1034,"nextTopicId":1050}}
