Some of the unschooler&#39;s blogs I&#39;ve read from various sites have left me questioning if I am a slacker! Granted, I have a new baby, and have to let a LOT of things go, but I have a hard time watching my 4.8yo occupy himself so much with TV and video games, which I allow only so I can have a breather. But when I take stock of what we accomplish in a days&#39; time, from conversations we have (that a month later he&#39;ll repeat ver-batem), to cooking time shared, and the oh-so-many learning opportunities that fall in-between our &#39;activities&#39;. I&#39;m raising a compassionate, self-motivated, well grounded little boy, who is a joy to be around. <br/>\n   I guess the question is, am I self-motivated? In my own way, I am. During my entire childhood I had a scheduled life. To this day, my mother attempts to impose a schedule on me (to no avail). I have chosen an unscheduled life, whereby I live by inspiration. &#39;What do I feel like doing now&#39; is what I live by. I offer the same lifestyle to my children. I feel it is their right, as is it mine. When I am still, inspiration comes. Some days I crave learning new things. I find my 4.8yo is the same (as I presume we all are, given the freedom to be still long enough to listen to ourselves.) <br/>\n  Writing gives me clarity, and I have found the reassurance I was seeking by just writing about this. I guess one unschooling principle that applies to this subject is &#39;not imposing outside standards/expectations on our children&#39;s development.&#39; Now if we could only figure out how to take that advice re: our own parental development!    <br/>\n<br/>\nstacyzme &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stacyzme@...\">stacyzme@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          I have read many of John Holts books and numerous unschooling <br/>\nwebsites/blogs and I am both excited and nervous.

I am not complaining, I love our life and felt content, but <br/>\nnow I wonder if it is &quot;enough&quot; of an environment to unschool. We <br/>\nlive in the suburbs instead of on a farm or in a city, although we <br/>\ndo go to museums and outings a couple times a month. We don&#39;t have <br/>\na homebased enterprise where the children can learn about economics <br/>\nand we don&#39;t have jobs where we can take them. I do volunteer work, <br/>\nbut it is with battered women, so I can&#39;t involve the kids there, <br/>\nalthough I am sure that there are community programs where the kids <br/>\ncould get involved if we decided to go in that direction instead. I <br/>\nam not super creative, although I can work a glue gun in a pinch, <br/>\nbut I don&#39;t make my own furniture or clothes. We do enjoy our <br/>\nchildren and like spending time with them, and as we are learning <br/>\nmore about unschooling we are shedding a lot of our prior notions <br/>\nabout what is kid stuff and what is for adults (although I still <br/>\ncan&#39;t get hubby to let dear son use power tools----he is 4) <br/>\nSo I guess I am wondering how average (god I hate that word) people <br/>\nunschool. Do they? Or maybe this is also an opportunity to really <br/>\nexamine the &quot;averageness&quot; of our lives and make some changes? Are <br/>\nthere any reading materials that include how children are soaking up <br/>\nknowledge in the midst of conventional life? Or are the featured <br/>\nfamilies I am reading about not the norm but the &quot;goal&quot;? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n         <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a PS3 game guru.<br/>\nGet your game face on with the latest PS3 news and previews at Yahoo!

I WOH fulltime, DH is <br/>\nfulltime at home with DS. Our days consist of lots of videogames <br/>\n(both DH and DS love them, I&#39;m just getting going on an old GameBoy <br/>\nwith Pokemon Ruby), movies, TV, occasional campfires in the back <br/>\nyard (don&#39;t forget the &#39;smores!!), lots of time hanging out with our <br/>\ngames (both guys have Nintendo DSs and I have the GBA) at Starbucks. <br/>\nWe look at stars when the night sky is really clear - but we don&#39;t <br/>\nknow all the constellations and we don&#39;t (yet) have a super <br/>\ntelescope. Yesterday DH spent a good part of the day making a case <br/>\nfor his DS from duct tape (it&#39;s pretty cool). DS and I want one too <br/>\nso we&#39;re going to Staples tonight to pick up multi colors of duct <br/>\ntape. Most of what goes into blogs and postings are the &quot;highlights&quot; <br/>\nand occasional &quot;lowlights&quot;, not the average days. I might post about <br/>\nhow DS did this or that cool thing but that&#39;s one &quot;postable&quot; thing <br/>\namong dozens of days.<br/>\n<br/>\nA typical week is basically: I work, they game, housework gets done, <br/>\nwe eat on a fairly regular basis, grocery shopping gets done, we <br/>\nwatch movies/TV (old episodes of MASH and Monty Python are &#39;hot&#39; at <br/>\nour house right now), we play with the dog, watch the fish in the <br/>\nfish tank (nothing &#39;fancy&#39;, some mollies, some neon tetras, and of <br/>\ncourse the scum sucker fish), maybe play some board games. That&#39;s <br/>\nabout it. Oh, we do have one &#39;date night&#39; per week, that alternates <br/>\nbetween DH and DS (I get 4 dates each month, they each get 2). When <br/>\nDH and I go out, DS visits MIL and FIL.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t write off the kids being involved with your volunteer <br/>\nwork. Yes, they probably can&#39;t come with you BUT they could <br/>\ncollect/donate toys for the kids of the women that come through the <br/>\nshelter (for example).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re focusing on what you don&#39;t have, don&#39;t do, etc. What DO you <br/>\nhave? What DO you love? What DO the kids love? If there are things <br/>\nyou&#39;d love to do but haven&#39;t, look for ways to explore them. Big <br/>\nexciting stuff all the time isn&#39;t really typical as far as I&#39;ve <br/>\nseen. Curiousity about the whole world is. And when you&#39;re curious <br/>\nabout everyone and everything, life really isn&#39;t so boring -there&#39;s <br/>\nalways something new to explore, do, learn - whether it&#39;s clearing a <br/>\nbit of backyard space for a firepit or learning how to make sushi or <br/>\nshopping in an ethnic market or going to a park in a different part <br/>\nof town.

Most of the <br/>\nfeatured families seem to live much more enriching lives than our <br/>\nfamily.  I am not complaining, I love our life and felt content, but <br/>\nnow I wonder if it is &quot;enough&quot; of an environment to unschool.  We <br/>\nlive in the suburbs instead of on a farm or in a city, although we <br/>\ndo go to museums and outings a couple times a month.  We don&#39;t have <br/>\na homebased enterprise where the children can learn about economics <br/>\nand we don&#39;t have jobs where we can take them.  I do volunteer work, <br/>\nbut it is with battered women, so I can&#39;t involve the kids there, <br/>\nalthough I am sure that there are community programs where the kids <br/>\ncould get involved if we decided to go in that direction instead.  I <br/>\nam not super creative, although I can work a glue gun in a pinch, <br/>\nbut I don&#39;t make my own furniture or clothes.  We do enjoy our <br/>\nchildren and like spending time with them, and as we are learning <br/>\nmore about unschooling we are shedding a lot of our prior notions <br/>\nabout what is kid stuff and what is for adults (although I still <br/>\ncan&#39;t get hubby to let dear son use power tools----he is 4)  <br/>\nSo I guess I am wondering how average (god I hate that word) people <br/>\nunschool.  Do they?  Or maybe this is also an opportunity to really <br/>\nexamine the &quot;averageness&quot; of our lives and make some changes?  Are <br/>\nthere any reading materials that include how children are soaking up <br/>\nknowledge in the midst of conventional life?  Or are the featured <br/>\nfamilies I am reading about not the norm but the &quot;goal&quot;?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24696,"nextTopicId":24701}}
