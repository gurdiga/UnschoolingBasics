And I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s not just this post, <br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\nlots of them, I just chose to respond to this one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when we don&#39;t want to hear the message we vilify the messengers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found the honesty from those on this list refreshingly motivating.  It <br/>\nhas worked for my family whose parents (hubby and I) needed it to drive us <br/>\nbeyond the point of resisting change.  For what its worth, every area in which we <br/>\nhave surrendered our control has been hugely successful and made for a much <br/>\nhappier bunch of young people and adults.  We have found it very true that <br/>\nchildren instinctually do make the best choices for themselves.  For the past nine <br/>\nyears we were sure they needed us to make their decisions for them.  We were <br/>\nwrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion for those who read and believe and embrace the idea of <br/>\nunschooling but don&#39;t like the method in which the message is being delivered--try it <br/>\nanyway!  Let go. Open your mind - fully.  There is a reason you joined this <br/>\nlist.  These are not new ideas, this is the way things have been done forever, <br/>\nbefore the industrial revolution, before modern man made all the silly <br/>\nbuildings to put the future little conformists in.  The apes still do it this way...   <br/>\n<br/>\nGo out and play.  Leave the laundry and go dig in the dirt with your kids. <br/>\nLearn from each other.  This is how life is supposed to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin, who is surprised at how protective she feels about the mentors on this <br/>\nlist. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14381,"nextTopicId":14481}}
