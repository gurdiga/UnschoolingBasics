Our first day here, my niece<br/>\ninvited us to her last day of camp to see her final<br/>\nproject. Afterward, she wanted to come home with me<br/>\nand the baby. Her mother (my sister) reminded her<br/>\nthat she had swim team practice which she had already<br/>\nmissed earlier in the week. My niece became very<br/>\nupset, crying and insisting that she wanted to spend<br/>\ntime with her baby cousin. At which point my sister<br/>\ndragged her kicking and screaming away to her own car.<br/>\n<br/>\n**********<br/>\nMy 2 cents --<br/>\n<br/>\nJudging by your sister&#39;s physical ability to drag this child against her will, I&#39;ll guess she&#39;s young. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe overscheduled. She has camp in the morning and swim team after that? And company visiting. Sounds like a lot to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, as in many situations like this that come up, it sounds like there was no discussion beforehand. If the night before your sister had talked to her daugher about their plans for the coming day and reminded her when she got up and continued to discuss what was coming up next as the day went on, and then added a reassurance about seeing you and the baby later in the day or whenever that was actually going to happen -- I&#39;m thinking things might have gone more smoothly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, if during those conversations, your sister&#39;s child had been able to plan far enough ahead to know that she wanted to skip swim team and see her relatives, nobody would have been put on the spot right at the end of a busy camp day. Sister would have had a chance to calmly think about it instead of feeling she needed to look like a &quot;good parent&quot; and her child could have expressed her wishes earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt no point would I have been wrestling my child into the car though. The swim team will survive without her and if she really misses going she could then speak up and learn about making plans and keeping them in her own time. And if she was antsy during the visit that didn&#39;t happen, that need could have been met with a walk or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of choices in these situations. Planning ahead and talking about those plans, especially with young children who may not remember what we all planned to do yesterday, is key.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":285320662,"authorName":"Johanna","from":"&quot;Johanna&quot; &lt;dialog@...&gt;","profile":"solelokua","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Visit with my sister brings up questions","postDate":"1184680822","msgId":24994,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY3aWkxbStscWRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDgwNjk0OS42OTM2LnFtQHdlYjM5NjA4Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24993,"nextInTopic":24995,"prevInTime":24993,"nextInTime":24995,"topicId":24990,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello from Germany, ...

At which point my sister<br/>\ndragged her kicking and screaming away to her own car.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, I asked how swim team practice had gone.  My<br/>\nniece said that it had been great, that she had spent<br/>\na lot of time afterward playing in the pool, and that<br/>\nshe hadn&#39;t realized how much she needed the time in<br/>\nthe pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here is my totally naive question.

It might have been just as good<br/>\nfor her to spend some time with me and her baby<br/>\ncousin.  My personal feeling is that perhaps the<br/>\nrelationship between parent and child is more<br/>\nimportant than the parents&#39; need to be right.  So my<br/>\nexample isn&#39;t a great one--just the one that started<br/>\nme questioning.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does one know, like Heather and her son&#39;s speech<br/>\ntherapy, how to choose whether or not to intervene? <br/>\nAnd does intervention itself go against the whole<br/>\nunschooling philosophy?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks if you&#39;ve made it this far.<br/>\nElena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSick sense of humor?
