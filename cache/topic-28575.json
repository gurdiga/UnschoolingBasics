DH sees the girls as &#39;his&#39; children, and although <br/>\nthey do see their birth father the girls do see DH as daddy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhilst FIL was ill DD&#39;s went to stay with their true paternal <br/>\ngrandparents, and when FIL died DH understanably wanted &#39;his&#39; children <br/>\nwith him - as he was upset and so were the girls, we felt it was a time <br/>\nto be together.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever MIL decided this was too stressful for her, it was OK for DH and <br/>\nI to stay with her but not the girls (we live overseas so had flown home <br/>\nto be there). This result in DH&#39;s sister having a go at him for <br/>\nupsetting mum and us ending up staying in a hotel.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to my problem - although youngest DD is seeming to be coping with the <br/>\nsituation, sad about grandad but she is coping in a &#39;normal&#39; way, elder <br/>\nDD is really struggling the whole situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is sad about grandad but feels that is wrong as he wasn&#39;t her &#39;real&#39; <br/>\ngrandad, she cant understand why &#39;grandma hates her&#39;, and she is worried <br/>\nthat if DH is pushed by his mum he will chose her over us and DD will <br/>\nloose her daddy - or I think that is what she is trying to say to us<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have tried saying that everything will be fine - but I dont think <br/>\nthat is doing the trick, and it doesnt help that we dont really know <br/>\nwhat the problem was for MIL<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas how to get to the bottom of what is bothering her, and also <br/>\nany ideas on things we can do the help her through her grief, and also <br/>\nto reassure her that daddy is staying and everything will be OK.<br/>\n<br/>\n.....families can be such hard work sometimes :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance<br/>\nSarah</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240396546,"authorName":"peacefulhorizons2005","from":"&quot;peacefulhorizons2005&quot; &lt;tranquildreams2@...&gt;","profile":"peacefulhorizons2005","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Anyone see the recent article in New York Times?","postDate":"1198924243","msgId":28674,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZsNTdraitlMGJwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZrNmUxNys4YTYxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28576,"nextInTopic":29547,"prevInTime":28673,"nextInTime":28675,"topicId":28575,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, was just going thru posts & saw this one.

When he was governor of AR, he signed laws LOWIERING<br/>\nthe required school attendance age, and made it more difficult for<br/>\npeople to take their kids out of public schools in order to<br/>\nhomeschool. (See the bill # H.B. 1724 - arkansas.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone passed this link along to me awhile ago, and after checking<br/>\ninto Ron Paul I will cast my vote for him.  He is very strong on<br/>\nindividual rights and has been so for his 20 years in Congress. AND he<br/>\nspeaks out publicly about getting govt out of private lives when it<br/>\ncomes to education, especially homeschooling:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ronpaul2008.com/homeschoolers/\">http://www.ronpaul2008.com/homeschoolers/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a short video clip on the page where you can hear Dr.<br/>\nPaul address homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis website has a ton of other information on other topics such as<br/>\nimmigration, taxes (he wants to eliminate the federal income tax),<br/>\nhealthcare, social security, 2nd Amendment rights, etc. Dr. Paul&#39;s<br/>\nmain message is we have to go back to following the Constitution.<br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Paul has a HUGE grassroots movement but he isn&#39;t so well-liked by<br/>\nthe establishment so he hasn&#39;t been too well covered in the media<br/>\nuntil more recently. However, there are tons of video clips at<br/>\nYoutube.com including a Meet the Press interview, the Situation Room, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this information is useful to those of you concerned about the<br/>\ninterference of govt in homeschooling. I know that is a BIG concern<br/>\nfor me!<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joanne O&#39;N.&quot;<br/>\n&lt;seagullcaller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; You might want to check it out.
