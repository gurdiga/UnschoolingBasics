It called READING!&quot; <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I thought it was an awesome moment, and I wish I could accurately descibe the excitement in her voice and the joy on her face. Megan was referring to a &quot;Learn to Read with Reader Rabbit&quot; CDRom game that we bought a few weeks ago. Logan had wanted it, then lost interest in playing it pretty quickly. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Megan has decided though that she loves the game, and asks to play it at least once a day. She&#39;ll play it for quite awhile. Sometimes she works on the word matching, sometimes the &quot;click on the word I say&quot; game, sometimes she just goes through the little books that the game will read aloud to her. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  With Megan&#39;s autism, I had wondered if Megan would be able to make that connection between written words and the objects and concepts they represent, would she be able to learn to read without specific instruction, and how would she learn to read? by sight? phonics? I wondered what the catalyst for an interest in learning to read for herself might be and when it might come. <br/>\n  <br/>\nPaul and I have had many conversations about how people can function as adults without reading. When Megan&#39;s functioning was lower when she was younger, we had agreed that Megan would always have a home for us, and we&#39;d help her to be as independent as she could be. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Computers have been something that has really helped to bring the world to Megan. She only began using one around last March, but now she does well navigating through her games and online games. She is making connections, gaining understanding of abstract concepts and ideas, and observing and interacting with the world around her more. Computers have been the catalyst for understanding the connection between words she hears/says and written words, and given her a desire to learn to read for herself. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Just a few moments ago she asked me to load the game for her, saying &#39;It my best game! My mommy gave it to me, and it a gift to my heart!&quot; Wow...what do you say to that? A gift to her heart... <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Beth<br/>\n  Http://serendipityacademy.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSing, Dance, Laugh...LOVE!<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Next-gen email?
