I am so glad you retold it.  I remember<br/>\nhearing you tell it at the conference in Corvallis and there was an older<br/>\nlady sitting in front of me - a grandma probably new to RU who was muttering<br/>\nsomething like &quot;.at 2:00 in the morning?  He needs a sandwich?&quot;  Although<br/>\nshe sat in front of me I think I could hear her eyes rolling.  By the end of<br/>\nyour talk, though she had softened and was visibly more relaxed (if a bit<br/>\ntearful).   I think these ideas take a bit of time to soak in and make<br/>\nsense.  I have no doubt that these rabbits could be the turning point in<br/>\nthis family as mom takes on the responsibility of making sure they get taken<br/>\ncare of and the child is allowed to join in with all that love.  There is so<br/>\nmuch to be learned here and so many possible points of connection that could<br/>\ncome out of it.  Or it could spiral into a point of stress and contention<br/>\nand lead down a path of controlling behavior or the sadness of losing a pet<br/>\nbecause dd can&#39;t keep her end of the bargain.  How could she know at her<br/>\nage?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe old scenario of dutiful 7 yo jumping out of bed and running to the<br/>\nrabbit hutch to take care of her beloved bunnies hasn&#39;t panned out.  How<br/>\nabout a new vision where mom goes out every afternoon (before making dinner<br/>\nmaybe) and invites dd along to love on the bunnies together.  Maybe they end<br/>\nup walking hand in hand bonding, maybe a lot of the time dd says &quot;no thanks<br/>\nmom.&quot; And continues what she was doing but the love and respect stay in<br/>\ntact, the bunnies are never resented and as she matures dd will have an<br/>\nexcellent role model to build from.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis thread has been a good reminder for me as well.  We parents make these<br/>\nchoices all the time, every day.  Kelly&#39;s post is practically a step by step<br/>\nrecipe for peace.  I think I&#39;m gonna go read it again.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTruly,<br/>\n<br/>\nKrisula<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Rabbits","postDate":"1195309907","msgId":27793,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOUY3M0RCODMxNjY3Mi02NkMtMzIxREB3ZWJtYWlsLW1mMTIuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDcxMTE2MjMzOG0yY2QyOGNiMG83MmU3N2I3ZjM4Mzk3YTNjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDExOTUyMzY3NjcuNjc2LjY4MjU4Lm00OUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+CSA8OEM5RjY5RkJDNDlFRUVDLTc0OC0yNjBCQE1CTEstTTA0LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPiA8NjUxOGE5MzYwNzExMTYyMzM4bTJjZDI4Y2IwbzcyZTc3YjdmMzgzOTdhM2NAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":27790,"nextInTopic":27803,"prevInTime":27792,"nextInTime":27794,"topicId":27781,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Diana knows that those chances to be the best <br/>\nmom you can be can be limited.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you new to unschooling and this e-list, Diana&#39;s daughter, <br/>\nHannah, died last February of cancer. It was a huge blow to the <br/>\nunschooling world, but her death is a solemn reminder NOT to be <br/>\nsolemn---but to find joy in each and every minute we *do* have with our <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as Diana shows in her peanut better sandwich story, it doesn&#39;t <br/>\ntake much to change how *we* perceive things, how *we* can change the <br/>\nway we feel about a task---no matter how &quot;unreasonable.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to do it less and less, but the simple *thought* that this <br/>\nprecious child may be gone tomorrow has helped me through many angry, <br/>\nfrustrated moments. I still use it, but I&#39;ve found it easier to kind of <br/>\n*stay* in that mindset so that I don&#39;t have to reach for it as much. <br/>\nUsually simply a deep breath will help center and refocus me and remind <br/>\nme to honor my baby. Not that I still don&#39;t lose it! &lt;G&gt; But it&#39;s <br/>\ngotten easier and easier to banish those creepy thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot a day goes by that I don&#39;t think of Hannah (and Sam and Jacob).

There<br/>\nwas an evolution that occurred as time went on. His first sandwiches<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have tasted very good, I certainly didn&#39;t put any good feelings<br/>\ninto making them. I was grumbly and pissy and, quite frankly, a martyr. I<br/>\nstomped up the stairs for the 158th time, and three up I realized this<br/>\nsituation sucks for both of us. Who the heck is this woman, throwing<br/>\n*another* fit about a ding-dang sandwich at 2 am. DUH! How about making one<br/>\nat 11 and putting it in a baggie for the 2 am request? How about if I just<br/>\ntake a really deep breath. And another one. How else could this be? Who<br/>\n*else* should be making this sandwich? No one, really NO ONE, wants to eat a<br/>\nsandwich made by a martyr. I was *that* someone by the top of the stairs. I<br/>\nlovingly collected the fixins and put all of the honor I felt, in the<br/>\nability to make my boy a sandwich in the middle of the night, into each<br/>\nstroke of my knife. THAT was the best sandwich my son ever ate. *I* may be<br/>\nthe only one of us who knows, that sandwich was made with the biggest dose<br/>\nof mommy love available. I delivered it to him with a smile on my face and a<br/>\nbounce in my step and gave him a big hug.
