All I am babbling about I think is that I think people have a tendency to validate their own experiences by insisting that others pass them too.

I have a middle school teacher friend who doesn&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve that any old parent with no &quot;qualifications&quot; and no education<br/>\nthemselves has the ability and right to &quot;teach&quot; their children. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may not be as helpful to you, but my personal response is to not get<br/>\ninvolved in school conversations. Sometimes that means walking away.<br/>\nSometimes, as was the case right in my living room with a father of one of<br/>\nJayn&#39;s friends who wanted to tell me all about the nursery school he was<br/>\nintending on enrolling his 5yo in, I have to say, &quot;Look I&#39;m an Unschooler<br/>\nand for my own peace I don&#39;t do school conversations.&quot; I should add that<br/>\n*he* might be sure that they are sending the girl, but *his wife* seems to<br/>\nstill be doubting and debating the move herself, and is really interested in<br/>\nhome schooling. If someone were saying, &quot;I think you have to have a<br/>\nqualification...blah blah&quot; I might try to keep my reply to, &quot;Oh.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a saying.<br/>\n\t&quot;A man convinced against his will,<br/>\n\tIs of his own opinion still.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes all you can say is, &quot;We&#39;re really happy with what we&#39;re doing for<br/>\nnow. Our kid is thriving.&quot; And then let the joy and enthusiasm of your<br/>\nchildren speak for itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;I also know another homeschooler who uses a curriculum.  My son is young<br/>\nand I&#39;m new to unschooling, so I don&#39;t have to words you all might.  I&#39;m<br/>\nlooking for words to defend my position and share reasons why<br/>\nstate/government regulation of education isn&#39;t good and why homeschoolers<br/>\nwant to be where the regulations are nonexistent or loose, at least.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real question is why are you placing yourself in situations where you<br/>\nhave to defend your position? I know that happens unavoidably, such as with<br/>\nfamily, but getting into a big discussion isn&#39;t always good for your peace<br/>\nof mind. Feeling defensive is not the same vibe as answering genuine<br/>\ninquiries coming from a place of real curiosity in the questioner. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t concern myself with school regulations or school reform. Better<br/>\nminds than mine are spending all their lives doing just that. You might<br/>\nrefer people to John Taylor Gatto, as someone mentioned, or Life Learning<br/>\nMagazine, which has some ads for different books about the nature of<br/>\neducation. (I haven&#39;t read them because I&#39;m short on time right now, but<br/>\nthey might appeal to some folk with an interest in that direction). <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever regulation of homeschooling is another issue. It seems to largely<br/>\ncome down to the pragmatic situation that state regulation is irrelevant to<br/>\nthe kind of education Unschoolers end up with, and only makes paperwork for<br/>\nparents without genuinely impacting any of the supposedly &quot;educational&quot;<br/>\nactivities of the household. Since Unschooling considers every activity<br/>\nvaluable to learning, everything is educational. I think there may be some<br/>\nrelevant information at www.nhen.org which has legislative forums and areas<br/>\nfor debate of general homeschooling controversies.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;The homeschooler I spoke with <br/>\nrecently said that there were certain things that she felt people in our<br/>\nsociety needed to know and it was her job to teach those things to her<br/>\nson.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much do you value her friendship? I mean is this something you really<br/>\nwant to have to get into with her, or conversely does it really matter to<br/>\ntry and change her view? Perhaps you could ask her to expand and give<br/>\nexamples of the &quot;certain things&quot;. She may end up talking herself out of her<br/>\nown position. One question for her might be &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t he learn that when<br/>\nhe...[some real life situation]?&quot; If it is important in society, then he<br/>\nwould surely learn through interacting with real people in society. Is it<br/>\nhow to stand in line? One trip to Disneyland (or the market) will take care<br/>\nof that for life. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes my answer again would be &quot;Oh.&quot; I shrug my shoulders a lot. I<br/>\nrecently have begun to simply say, &quot;I&#39;m a Radical Unschooler&quot;. That often<br/>\nends any of these conversations. Only Jayn being her fabulous self is likely<br/>\nto make anyone determined and happy in their course think twice. Anyone<br/>\nalready having doubts or searching for a better way (like Unschooling) might<br/>\nbe phrasing their remarks more inquiringly than making sweeping definitive<br/>\nstatements.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose the wider issue of children being treated with respect and not<br/>\nhaving to live a life of coercion is an important one for parents to discuss<br/>\nwith one another. Some people are not ready to give up on something as basic<br/>\nto their children&#39;s freedom as letting them read what they like (they have<br/>\nbooklists), or follow an interest fully (they humorously belittle those<br/>\ninterests that are not vocational or important seeming). Getting into the<br/>\nvibrant, joyous possibilities of Unschooling and mindful parenting with<br/>\nthese people is like moving a mountain. However if we continue to<br/>\ntransparently display our lives of freedom to our acquaintances and<br/>\nassociates maybe our example will be the &quot;irresistible force&quot; that meets the<br/>\n&quot;immovable object&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I have a middle school teacher friend who doesn&#39;t believe <br/>\n  that any old parent with no &quot;qualifications&quot; and no education themselves has the <br/>\n  ability and right to &quot;teach&quot; their children.  I think because she had to go <br/>\n  to several years of college, take classes to learn how to teach, go through <br/>\n  student teaching and get a license, that she feels she is more qualified than me <br/>\n  or another person to &quot;teach&quot; our children.  She says the license is necessary <br/>\n  and is upset that people with BA degrees can now teach without the license.  <br/>\n  She believes that teaching needs to be regulated in some way.  Now of course <br/>\n  I&#39;m using the word teach because that&#39;s what she does.  She teaches.  As an <br/>\n  unschooler I realize that word doesn&#39;t exist.  So stick with me here.  What I&#39;m <br/>\n  looking for is an explanation of why public school isn&#39;t the best choice for our <br/>\n  kids and why the regulation isn&#39;t necessary - or maybe even why it&#39;s bad.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I also know another homeschooler who uses a curriculum.  My son is young and <br/>\n  I&#39;m new to unschooling, so I don&#39;t have to words you all might.  I&#39;m looking <br/>\n  for words to defend my position and share reasons why state/government <br/>\n  regulation of education isn&#39;t good and why homeschoolers want to be where the <br/>\n  regulations are nonexistent or loose, at least.  The homeschooler I spoke with <br/>\n  recently said that there were certain things that she felt people in our society <br/>\n  needed to know and it was her job to teach those things to her son.  In the <br/>\n  future, my response to her would be something like, &quot;why do you get to decide what <br/>\n  people in our society - or your son for that matter - NEED to know?  Why isn&#39;t <br/>\n  what your son wants to know just as important, if not more so.&quot;  Feel free to <br/>\n  expand on that as well, but the real question here is related to the above.  <br/>\n  What do I say to teachers?  I know they have their hands tied in many <br/>\n  situations.  But how do I articulate the reasons I&#39;ve decided to homeschool and <br/>\n  specifically UNschool and why do I want the government to keep their hands out of my <br/>\n  business?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t mean to say that I don&#39;t know these things.  Of course, inside me I <br/>\n  know.  But I have trouble coming up with the words to share with these people.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Can you share your thoughts?  Thanks in advance.<br/>\n  Beth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Doing and asking and doing some  <br/>\nmore.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere are groomers and owners/grads of grooming schools who are clamoring  <br/>\nfor all groomers to be certified. To be certified, you would have to be a  <br/>\ngraduate of an accredited school. :-P~~~~*<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m one who would be grandfathered in because I have enough &quot;time in&quot; and  <br/>\nI&#39;ve passed the &quot;Master Groomer&quot; quiz.  Lucky me.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere are hundreds of self-taught groomers (and I&#39;ve met many, many of  them) <br/>\nwho are absolutely incredible dog people with lovely hands and eyes for  <br/>\ndogs. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate for a minute to hand my dogs over to them<br/>\n <br/>\nBut there are hundreds of &quot;certified&quot; groomers (and I&#39;ve personally met  <br/>\ndozens) who don&#39;t even know one breed from another, who have no idea how to  <br/>\nhandle a difficult pooch---and whom I wouldn&#39;t let touch my dogs with a  Q-tip.<br/>\n <br/>\n.*They* are the ones who are trying to kick us out of the club----we didn&#39;t  <br/>\nsuffer what they suffered. <br/>\n <br/>\nHell, I could&#39;ve been one of their instructors! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThose who have &quot;done their time&quot; are vested in the system. They  want the <br/>\nsame for everyone else---for them to do the time too.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100027905,"authorName":"TreeGoddess","from":"TreeGoddess &lt;treegoddess@...&gt;","profile":"odrade7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] defense of state regulation question","postDate":"1095736711","msgId":3259,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVBMUI5NTNDLTBCN0MtMTFEOS04RjUxLTAwMDM5M0E1REE2NkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFkNC4yYTZmZTIwYS4yZTgwZTkxOEBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFkNC4yYTZmZTIwYS4yZTgwZTkxOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3258,"nextInTopic":3260,"prevInTime":3258,"nextInTime":3260,"topicId":3256,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The hard part to<br/>\nteaching isn&#39;t presenting the information - a machine can do that<br/>\nmuch.  The hard part is maintaining discipline, keeping order,<br/>\ncomplying with (lots of) regulations and keeping everyone on the same<br/>\npage - even if they are capable of going on or struggling to keep up. <br/>\nA parent doesn&#39;t need to be taught to do that - for the most part,<br/>\nit&#39;s not applicable.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents have a much simpler job because there is less disruption, more<br/>\none on one time, individualized attention, no administrators making<br/>\nthings harder, no school boards with political agendas to worry about<br/>\nand no concerned parents threatening to sue at the drop of a hat<br/>\n(unless you intend to sue yourself).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso don&#39;t forget, you have ALL SORTS of statistics and data to back<br/>\nyou up.  My favorite is that the single strongest indicator of success<br/>\nin education is parental involvement - stronger than class size,<br/>\nwealth of the community, number of computers in the classroom, and<br/>\neven teacher abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 20 Sep 2004 22:16:56 EDT, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bethryco@...\">bethryco@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bethryco@...\">bethryco@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Recently I have come up against people who have defended the government<br/>\n&gt; regulating education.
