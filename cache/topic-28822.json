I have been<br/>\ncaring for my 85 yr old mother for so long I can&#39;t<br/>\neven remember a time I wasn&#39;t. She isn&#39;t bedridden,<br/>\nshe&#39;s almost completely blind and has heart trouble<br/>\n(and other ailments). She ensconced herself on the top<br/>\nof a hill 20 miles from town and we (dh and I) are<br/>\nresponsible for everything. My most practical advice<br/>\nis to find a friend. I have a friend, we&#39;ve been<br/>\nthrough everything together, and now we are dealing<br/>\nwith our elderly parents together. I call her, she<br/>\ncalls me, she understands when I am ready to rip my<br/>\nhair out with frustration, I can see the humor in what<br/>\nis going on with her situation although others would<br/>\nbe horrified if they heard us laughing. Being able to<br/>\nget your frustration out and sharing with someone is<br/>\nhonestly the best thing you can do. You can try<br/>\nenlisting your brother with very specific tasks but<br/>\ndon&#39;t count on him. I&#39;m not an only child, I&#39;m just<br/>\nthe only one that makes an effort. See if you can find<br/>\na rhythm to your parent&#39;s needs and try to meet them<br/>\nbefore they ask. My mom needs to go shopping all the<br/>\ntime it seems, much more often than I shop for the<br/>\nfour of us. I head a lot of it off by buying in bulk<br/>\nand bringing it unasked for. If you can get them to<br/>\neat frozen dinners buy lots of them on sale. Better<br/>\nyet, Meals on Wheels!!! Mind you my mother won&#39;t do<br/>\neither of these but they would make her (and my) life<br/>\nso much easier. See where errands need to be run and<br/>\ntry to eliminate or lessen them. Buy 100 stamps, not<br/>\n10. Get drugs in the mail. Make a list of things you<br/>\nare doing, it will help you see what will need to be<br/>\ndone. Enlist friends to stop in and just visit. One of<br/>\nthe best things I have is a neighbor who has a<br/>\ncappuccino machine. Two, three times a week she makes<br/>\none for my mother and brings it to her in the morning.<br/>\nMy mother thinks she is being neighborly... she<br/>\nis...but she is also doing a visual check that my mom<br/>\nis okay. I call her every night after dark to check<br/>\nthat she&#39;s okay. Call Senior Services, they may be of<br/>\nhelp and can tell you what services are available in<br/>\ntheir area. Commandeer a room in their house for the<br/>\nkids and introduce some toys and activities that are<br/>\nfor there only. Going and spending the night may be<br/>\neasier too. If nothing else you can get lots done<br/>\nwhile the kids are asleep. Enlist your 4.5 yr old to<br/>\nbe Grandma&#39;s assistant, let her do some simple<br/>\n&quot;helping Grandma&quot; chores, get Grandma some water, give<br/>\nfeel better neck rubs, empty the dryer, fold, set the<br/>\ntable, water plants, whatever she can do. It won&#39;t be<br/>\nperfect but it will help everyone on many levels. It<br/>\nis a learning process, someday you will be old hand at<br/>\nthis, you will still want to rip your hair out but you<br/>\nwill mostly feel more able.

They both need at least part time home health aides,<br/>\nwhich should be covered by insurance (if they&#39;ve got insurance) or by<br/>\ndisability or other government programs (not that I&#39;m a big fan of<br/>\ngovernment programs but here&#39;s a case where they can be useful).<br/>\n<br/>\nFIL has been in the hospital, from a critical care unit to ICU to his<br/>\ncurrent stay in a minimal care area, since just after Thanksgiving.<br/>\nPrior to that, he was home but needed pretty much full time care. MIL<br/>\nworks fulltime (BTW they&#39;re similar in age to your folks - FIL is about<br/>\nto turn 63 and MIL is in her mid/late 50s) to keep the insurance<br/>\ncoverage and income - FIL had to retire early on disability late in 2006<br/>\nbecause he couldn&#39;t stand or drive (he stood up at work and fell down<br/>\nbecause he was dizzy). So, family were trying to care for him, taking<br/>\nturns. But DH is the only one of the siblings (he has 3 sisters) who<br/>\nisn&#39;t working fulltime. It was hard to get them to understand that just<br/>\nbecause he didn&#39;t go out to a paying job all day, that he wasn&#39;t &quot;free&quot;<br/>\nto spend all day in the IL&#39;s small senior housing apartment with DS (who<br/>\nis 9 1/2 and really needs a lot of space to move and make noise and play<br/>\nfreely). It finally got so bad that a visiting nurse (who they FINALLY<br/>\ngot to come in, after DH and I were on them about it for several months)<br/>\nwho came in to check the dressings on FIL&#39;s sores (from sitting all the<br/>\ntime and having legs so swollen with fluid that they oozed) noticed that<br/>\nhis blood pressure was dangerously low and his temp was bordering on<br/>\nhypothermia (in a comfortably heated apartment with a blanket on) and so<br/>\non. That was an ambulance ride to ER and he&#39;s been in the hospital ever<br/>\nsince (and grumping that he doesn&#39;t get enough visitors!) And he&#39;ll be<br/>\ngoing to a convalescent/rehab facility from the hospital and he may need<br/>\nmore care than home provides so may end up in a care facility<br/>\npermanently.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe upside of all this is that the hospital has social services workers<br/>\nand such who are working with the ILs to arrange post-hospital care with<br/>\nthem - it&#39;s not just us telling them they need to get home care and<br/>\nsuch.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

It seems that they are needing me  <br/>\n&gt; now more than ever. They are really trying not to be a &quot;burden&quot; on  <br/>\n&gt; me, but since I don&#39;t have any siblings (I have a 38 year old brother  <br/>\n&gt; that can&#39;t seem to take care of himself) that can help, the care is  <br/>\n&gt; falling on me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have two kiddos (4 & 21 months), and my own house to keep up with  <br/>\n&gt; taking care of. It seems most days I have just enough (if even)  <br/>\n&gt; energy to keep up with my kiddos. Today my mom is at her house (a 40  <br/>\n&gt; minute drive away, and my son isn&#39;t fond of longer car trips right  <br/>\n&gt; now) waiting for me and the kids to come by. She&#39;ll have a list of  <br/>\n&gt; things she&#39;ll need done (and bless her heart she really does try to  <br/>\n&gt; keep the list to a minimum). While my own home needs tending to. Dh  <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have dd go pee before bed last night and she went in her  <br/>\n&gt; sleep. The mattress pad was bunched where she was lying so it totally  <br/>\n&gt; missed the pad and stained the mattress. I have that to clean. I have  <br/>\n&gt; at least 2 loads of cloth diapers that need watched, kids who will  <br/>\n&gt; need fed soon, trash and recycling that needs to be gathered and  <br/>\n&gt; taken out because pick up is tomorrow, (among other things that  <br/>\n&gt; probably should be done today). As well as two kids that  <br/>\n&gt; (understandably) want to play with mommy most the day.<br/>\n&gt;   Yet, my mom who is sitting at home, confined to her bed, or chair,   <br/>\n&gt; has chores for me to do. She has no other choice, she recently broke  <br/>\n&gt; her ankle so bad she&#39;s needed three surgeries in one month. She is in  <br/>\n&gt; pain. She can&#39;t walk at all. She probably won&#39;t be able to for at  <br/>\n&gt; least 4 months according to her ortho. On top of that when she was  <br/>\n&gt; being pre-oped for surgery they find some heart abnormality. My dad  <br/>\n&gt; has his own share of heart & lung problems and is on oxygen full  <br/>\n&gt; time. He also is working full time (though he shouldn&#39;t be) because  <br/>\n&gt; they have very little retirement saved.<br/>\n&gt; Last week after a particularly challenging day with kids. They were  <br/>\n&gt; finally winding down and I was able to grab a couple minutes to  <br/>\n&gt; myself for a cup of tea. The phone rings, I don&#39;t answer. The machine  <br/>\n&gt; picks up. It is my mom is tears, saying how overwhelmed she is with  <br/>\n&gt; everything and that she needs to talk. I don&#39;t pick up. I try to just  <br/>\n&gt; take the time to have my tea, but its too late. Hard to enjoy my tea  <br/>\n&gt; when I&#39;m concerned about her. And I call her right back. And for an  <br/>\n&gt; hour try to offer reassurance. She is, as always, *extremely*  <br/>\n&gt; grateful to me (that is what makes me want to help her, because I  <br/>\n&gt; know how much she truly appreciates me).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Okay, Phew so that is the story currently. I think the reality of  <br/>\n&gt; what is happening doesn&#39;t match what I *thought* would happen. My  <br/>\n&gt; parents are still fairly young. I didn&#39;t expect to have to play such  <br/>\n&gt; an active role in taking care of them...yet. I knew it would happen  <br/>\n&gt; but it caught me off guard, as life always does. If my kids were  <br/>\n&gt; older it probably wouldn&#39;t be such a big deal, but they are still so  <br/>\n&gt; young, and need me so much right now. I also know that their are  <br/>\n&gt; people who have much more demanding situations. I know I should be  <br/>\n&gt; thankful that at least my parents are around to take care of. And  <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t get me wrong, I love them very much and am so grateful to have  <br/>\n&gt; them. Which makes me feel guilty for being a whiner, lol!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve complained enough.:) Off to get started on getting a little play  <br/>\n&gt; time in with the kids before breakfast, and all the rest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation.

My parents aren&#39;t that old<br/>\neither ... 65 and 61 but I am seeing them begin to decline... my<br/>\nfather has heart issues and just newly diagnosed with diabetes (try to<br/>\nexplain to someone this age and set in his ways why he MUST change his<br/>\ndiet!UGH!)  my mother has fibromyalgia and is in fairly good health<br/>\nbut I do see her stamina and pain levels becoming more of an issue for<br/>\nher in the past year.    <br/>\n<br/>\n   A few suggestions for you to help this stressful period feel a<br/>\nlittle less stressful... while I know little children prefer mommy<br/>\nperhaps while you are doing chores for grandmother have her read to<br/>\nthem or play simple games, even sitting and coloring or talking about<br/>\nwhen she was a little girl could be a really great time of bonding for<br/>\nthem.  You could also enlist their help  and involve them somehow in<br/>\nthe house chores for grandmother... that often gives the little ones<br/>\nsuch a boost of feeling big!   My 6 yr old loves nothing better than<br/>\nto help grandpa with a chore or even just to carry something or<br/>\nretrieve something for a grandparent that they can&#39;t do for<br/>\nthemselves.    My mother had foot surgery last summer and Jack was<br/>\nthrilled to be the one in charge of putting her pillow under her foot<br/>\neach time she moved from place to place.    While I was taking care of<br/>\nmy mother I also tried to remember how boring it could be for him to<br/>\nbe stuck inside for more of the day than he was used to and made sure<br/>\nto stock grandmother with supplies so we could go outside for 30<br/>\nminutes here and there.   I also tried to anticipate the types of<br/>\nthings that might need to be done there so I didn&#39;t find myself<br/>\nrunning back and forth unnecessarily(my parents are 1 1/2 hrs away but<br/>\nmy brother lives next door and is helpful but does have to work all<br/>\nday).    Anyway I think that this is one of those issues that may be a<br/>\nlittle unique to our generation... our parents waited longer to have<br/>\nchildren than our grandparents so we now have &quot;elderly&quot; parents in our<br/>\n30-40&#39;s!   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway please don&#39;t miss an opportunity to give your kids some really<br/>\ngreat memories of their grandparents and find ways to help your<br/>\nparents feel useful by helping with the kids while you do things for<br/>\nthem.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\nLisa B <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kendrah Nilsestuen<br/>\n&lt;carebear-79@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; This past year my parents health has really went on a downhill slide,  <br/>\n&gt; currently they are 62&58 years old. It seems that they are needing me  <br/>\n&gt; now more than ever. They are really trying not to be a &quot;burden&quot; on  <br/>\n&gt; me, but since I don&#39;t have any siblings (I have a 38 year old brother  <br/>\n&gt; that can&#39;t seem to take care of himself) that can help, the care is  <br/>\n&gt; falling on me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have two kiddos (4 & 21 months), and my own house to keep up with  <br/>\n&gt; taking care of. It seems most days I have just enough (if even)  <br/>\n&gt; energy to keep up with my kiddos. Today my mom is at her house (a 40  <br/>\n&gt; minute drive away, and my son isn&#39;t fond of longer car trips right  <br/>\n&gt; now) waiting for me and the kids to come by. She&#39;ll have a list of  <br/>\n&gt; things she&#39;ll need done (and bless her heart she really does try to  <br/>\n&gt; keep the list to a minimum). While my own home needs tending to. Dh  <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have dd go pee before bed last night and she went in her  <br/>\n&gt; sleep. The mattress pad was bunched where she was lying so it totally  <br/>\n&gt; missed the pad and stained the mattress. I have that to clean. I have  <br/>\n&gt; at least 2 loads of cloth diapers that need watched, kids who will  <br/>\n&gt; need fed soon, trash and recycling that needs to be gathered and  <br/>\n&gt; taken out because pick up is tomorrow, (among other things that  <br/>\n&gt; probably should be done today). As well as two kids that  <br/>\n&gt; (understandably) want to play with mommy most the day.<br/>\n&gt;   Yet, my mom who is sitting at home, confined to her bed, or chair,   <br/>\n&gt; has chores for me to do. She has no other choice, she recently broke  <br/>\n&gt; her ankle so bad she&#39;s needed three surgeries in one month. She is in  <br/>\n&gt; pain. She can&#39;t walk at all. She probably won&#39;t be able to for at  <br/>\n&gt; least 4 months according to her ortho. On top of that when she was  <br/>\n&gt; being pre-oped for surgery they find some heart abnormality. My dad  <br/>\n&gt; has his own share of heart & lung problems and is on oxygen full  <br/>\n&gt; time. He also is working full time (though he shouldn&#39;t be) because  <br/>\n&gt; they have very little retirement saved.<br/>\n&gt; Last week after a particularly challenging day with kids. They were  <br/>\n&gt; finally winding down and I was able to grab a couple minutes to  <br/>\n&gt; myself for a cup of tea. The phone rings, I don&#39;t answer. The machine  <br/>\n&gt; picks up. It is my mom is tears, saying how overwhelmed she is with  <br/>\n&gt; everything and that she needs to talk. I don&#39;t pick up. I try to just  <br/>\n&gt; take the time to have my tea, but its too late. Hard to enjoy my tea  <br/>\n&gt; when I&#39;m concerned about her. And I call her right back. And for an  <br/>\n&gt; hour try to offer reassurance. She is, as always, *extremely*  <br/>\n&gt; grateful to me (that is what makes me want to help her, because I  <br/>\n&gt; know how much she truly appreciates me).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Okay, Phew so that is the story currently. I think the reality of  <br/>\n&gt; what is happening doesn&#39;t match what I *thought* would happen. My  <br/>\n&gt; parents are still fairly young. I didn&#39;t expect to have to play such  <br/>\n&gt; an active role in taking care of them...yet. I knew it would happen  <br/>\n&gt; but it caught me off guard, as life always does. If my kids were  <br/>\n&gt; older it probably wouldn&#39;t be such a big deal, but they are still so  <br/>\n&gt; young, and need me so much right now. I also know that their are  <br/>\n&gt; people who have much more demanding situations. I know I should be  <br/>\n&gt; thankful that at least my parents are around to take care of. And  <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t get me wrong, I love them very much and am so grateful to have  <br/>\n&gt; them. Which makes me feel guilty for being a whiner, lol!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve complained enough.:) Off to get started on getting a little play  <br/>\n&gt; time in with the kids before breakfast, and all the rest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation. Being a  <br/>\n&gt; parent of young children, while also having to take care of your own  <br/>\n&gt; parents? Any experiences to share?
