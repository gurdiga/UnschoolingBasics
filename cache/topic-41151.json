We each have our ways and sometimes things go the way we think they will and sometimes they don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nPractical suggestion -- probably already mentioned -- lots of detangler for your daughter&#39;s hair during her bath and then spray detangler while brushing, not combing.<br/>\n<br/>\nEating out -- let him take your daughter alone if he wants to go. Evil, huh? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd try to stop worrying about what other people think. Every mother has had a screaming kid in the grocery store and thinks every other mother thinks less of her. We don&#39;t. We think you have your hands full and we&#39;ve all been there and feel sorry for you and hope everyone gets home safe and gets a nap. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the feelings of resentment are not uncommon either. But they are coming from your expectations. How many Moms resent the dirty floor in the kids bedroom? Some get upset all the time, some of us close the door. <br/>\n<br/>\nSee when you can &quot;close the door&quot; and when there is a real safety issue involved.

I actually play pretty crazy w/ the baby, too, but I am close by so nothing too bad can happen, you know?  It is more that I feel when my husband is the one responsible for watching the kids he doesn&#39;t do so actively, in a way that would allow them to explore but be safe.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another example is while we were visiting a friend this week, Nisa was playing with a cat that my friends warned us scratches and bites w/o warning.  He gave Nisa verbal warnings and just sat back and let her do her thing.  That may have been appropriate for an older child or a child who knows how to play gently with animals, but Nisa has a history of being rough with animals.  I went around the room with her, trying to help her be gentle with the cat, and then when that didn&#39;t work so well, trying to keep her and the cat apart so she didn&#39;t get scratched and bitten and traumatized.  In retrospect, it would&#39;ve worked better to just ask my friends to keep the cat in a bedroom or something, given I know that my daughter is not ready to play with animals, at least not with a lot of help and with animals who are friendly.  Later in the week she played pretty well with a gentle, older dog.  I had asked my husband to watch Nisa while we were at my friends&#39; house because I was watching the baby crawl and making sure he didn&#39;t get into anything.  When we go to other people&#39;s houses, there are always lots of things that babies can&#39;t play with or that are dangerous or could get broken, but I still need to let Yeshaiah crawl and play.

I know CPR and<br/>\ncan call 911 (that might be oversimplifying things a bit) and she feels<br/>\nhas a little higher threshold when it comes to safety issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you have to remember who is defining what is safe.  As an example,<br/>\nmy son fell down the stairs when he was in my parents&#39; care about a year<br/>\nago and got a HUGE lump on his head.  They told me he was &quot;okay&quot; and that<br/>\nhe had fallen down.  They didn&#39;t tell me that he had fallen down the<br/>\nSTAIRS.  As an RN I would want to monitor DS in case he had a head bleed,<br/>\nbecause that is MY level of concern around a fall.  My parents have a<br/>\ndifferent level of concern.  Because I&#39;m not coparenting with them, I have<br/>\nsimply limited time alone with my son since then because I feel they<br/>\ncannot be safe around him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are defining what is safe and not safe, then punishing your husband<br/>\nwhen he doesn&#39;t meet this definition, I feel that&#39;s an unfair position to<br/>\nplace him in.  Sometimes it&#39;s important to swallow your fears and step<br/>\nback in order to let him be a parent too, in his own manner and style, and<br/>\nnot expect him to parent as you&#39;ve defined it.  I feel sometimes safety is<br/>\nused as a bludgeon in a parenting relationship because it gives you<br/>\npercieved moral high ground - do as I say or our our child will be harmed,<br/>\nif you don&#39;t, you&#39;re wanting to harm our child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can speak from experience that having your partner critique your<br/>\nparenting on a regular basis in disempowering and does nothing to help you<br/>\nparent as a team.  It does nothing to help your husband see your side of<br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t mean he is allowed carte blanche and you have to bite your<br/>\ntongue all of the time.  I would suggest having a serious non-fighting<br/>\nconversation and for you to prioritize what is most important for you when<br/>\nit comes to your comfort with his parenting.  Maybe let go of the hair<br/>\nthing but tell him you need to see him be more hands-on instead of<br/>\nparenting across from the room.  This would bother me as well, but not<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s not safe but because I believe it&#39;s vital as a parent to be<br/>\npresent and available until your child starts to actively seek<br/>\nindependence from you at an older age.  Ask him what you can do to help<br/>\nhim feel more like part of your parenting team, and be prepared to<br/>\ncompromise.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a very personal note, as someone who had children 15 years into a<br/>\nalmost 17 year old rock-solid relationship, it shook us both to our core<br/>\nto have a third person between us that both of us were willing to go to<br/>\nthe mat for, and willing to hurt each other in order to protect our son. <br/>\nThe intensity of love you feel for a child is unmeasurable and can drive<br/>\nyou to hurt the person who you love, have chosen to spend your life with,<br/>\nhave chosen to parent with and maybe have chosen to eventually die with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the cat issue - we are a cat household and our cats have scratched<br/>\nour toddler son.

I actually play pretty crazy w/ the baby, too, but I am close by so nothing too bad can happen, you know?  It is more that I feel when my husband is the one responsible for watching the kids he doesn&#39;t do so actively, in a way that would allow them to explore but be safe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example is while we were visiting a friend this week, Nisa was playing with a cat that my friends warned us scratches and bites w/o warning.  He gave Nisa verbal warnings and just sat back and let her do her thing.  That may have been appropriate for an older child or a child who knows how to play gently with animals, but Nisa has a history of being rough with animals.  I went around the room with her, trying to help her be gentle with the cat, and then when that didn&#39;t work so well, trying to keep her and the cat apart so she didn&#39;t get scratched and bitten and traumatized.  In retrospect, it would&#39;ve worked better to just ask my friends to keep the cat in a bedroom or something, given I know that my daughter is not ready to play with animals, at least not with a lot of help and with animals who are friendly.  Later in the week she played pretty well with a gentle, older dog.  I had asked my husband to watch Nisa while we were at my friends&#39; house because I was watching the baby crawl and making sure he didn&#39;t get into anything.  When we go to other people&#39;s houses, there are always lots of things that babies can&#39;t play with or that are dangerous or could get broken, but I still need to let Yeshaiah crawl and play.  Anyway, I felt resentful b/c I then had to help both children and it felt stressful and overwhelming given that it&#39;s always a bit trickier in someone else&#39;s house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically my complaint is that my husband parents from a distance quite frequently, and verbally warns the kids about potential dangers but does nothing more.  He even does this with the baby.  Sometimes he will intervene after making many verbal commands.

I think you both made some points that are very helpful.  I often do not appreciate what my husband does do and I often judge his behavior through the lens of what I think he should do.  I am having a hard time figuring out when to step in and when to just let him do things his way, especially when we are in a situation together and he responds one way and my feeling is different or when we are trying to negotiate something together.  Today I suggested that we stop combing Nisa&#39;s hair and he was very opposed to that idea.  He is the one who combs her hair and he enjoys it.  I have no idea how he can enjoy it when she is screaming so loudly, but I think he is able to tune them out when they are screaming.  Anyway, I don&#39;t feel like I can cut her hair without his agreeing, because that would cause a rift in our relationship.  And he wants to keep combing.  So where to go from there?  Also, if he tells Nisa no about something and I think she should be able to do it?  Do I say something or just let him decide?  I do believe he should be able to build his own relationship with the children.  <br/>\nSomething else that came up today and has come up previously is that my husband likes to go out to eat and I prefer to just get take-out and eat at home because sometimes things get hectic and stressful when we&#39;re out.  He always insists that we actually eat in the restaurant and says &quot;I don&#39;t mind eating out with the children&quot; like he just doesn&#39;t care that the children and I can&#39;t really have an enjoyable meal out.  Then again, I don&#39;t consider his feelings and needs as much as I should.  You both have given me a lot to think about.  Thank you for responding!<br/>\n<br/>\nLydia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lidjalynne05&quot; &lt;princessjasmine05@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We have talked about it and I don&#39;t think he sees anything wrong with his choices, and maybe I am overreacting? <br/>\n&gt; ******************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Its hard to know. I used to be appalled at the sorts of things my stepson was allowed to do by his bio mom - so many of them seemed dangerous! and yet the only time he&#39;s ever had a broken bone, he tripped over his own feet. Does your dd seem to want more support? That seems like a bigger question, in a way. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The only thing I could come up with is that if he isn&#39;t being there like I would like, I could just be present myself. <br/>\n&gt; ********************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s certainly an option, if you feel like the kids need/want more support than your dh is able to give them. But at the same time, if you are stepping in too often, you are depriving the kids of a chance to form their own relationship with their dad. Its not going to be the same kind of relationship they have with you - it wouldn&#39;t be if you were 100% on the same page in terms of parenting. You&#39;re different people. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the challenges of parenting with a partner, even a partner who &quot;gets&quot; unschooling, is that the other person is never going to do things, handle things, react to things, in exactly the same way you will. At some point, for your own peace of mind, it really helps to accept that. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Now that he is an adult and can do whatever he wants, that is what he does, regardless of how it affects other people.  We often argue that he doesn&#39;t help out enough with the kids or spend enough time playing with and connecting with them.<br/>\n&gt; *****************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Arguing with him isn&#39;t likely to make the idea of connecting with his children more attractive. If you want to help him connect more, you can look for ways to help him do that - to make the idea of spending time with his children something that makes him feel good. Look for ways to set him and the kids up for success together, ways for him to feel positive and successful and an imporant part of his kids&#39; world. Tell him stories about your days that make him smile. Find ways for him to do fun, special things with the kids when he has the energy to do them. That&#39;s more work for you in the short run, but the better he feels about being a dad, his children&#39;s dad, the more he&#39;ll choose to engage with them. That&#39;s human nature - we do things that feel good. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Here is another issue: my daughter hates getting her hair combed and braided.  She screams bloody murder. <br/>\n&gt; *******************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mo is like that. We&#39;ve long since stopped trying to brush or comb her hair. For awhile she was happy cutting it (herself), but now she wants it long. If she had the kind of hair that dreds easily we&#39;d have discussed that, but her hair is very fine, so it just looks messy. She&#39;s very active, so I suspect it would always look messy even if she combed it a dozen times a day ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; My husband is 100% against it and says we should let her decide.  She is less than two.  I think her screaming is a way of saying she wants it cut.<br/>\n&gt; **********************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How is she with scissors? Honestly, my own experience with a very young child cutting her own hair was that she was very very careful about not poking herself or snipping her ears (but couldn&#39;t hold still well enough for me to avoid the same hazards). Young kids often don&#39;t care a whole lot either way about the length of their hair, but they also don&#39;t like adults taking the matter out of their hands. If she doesn&#39;t have the coordination to use scissors, yet, maybe she&#39;d like to hold out locks of hair for you to snip at her direction. Make it fun *and* her decision. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 15)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: parenting differences .  . .","postDate":"1251498172","msgId":41155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg3OWxicythMWR2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg3N2JmOSs5amNiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41153,"nextInTopic":41156,"prevInTime":41154,"nextInTime":41156,"topicId":41151,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ****************** Its hard to know.

That seems like a bigger question, in a way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The only thing I could come up with is that if he isn&#39;t being there like I would like, I could just be present myself. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>********************<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s certainly an option, if you feel like the kids need/want more support than your dh is able to give them. But at the same time, if you are stepping in too often, you are depriving the kids of a chance to form their own relationship with their dad. Its not going to be the same kind of relationship they have with you - it wouldn&#39;t be if you were 100% on the same page in terms of parenting. You&#39;re different people. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the challenges of parenting with a partner, even a partner who &quot;gets&quot; unschooling, is that the other person is never going to do things, handle things, react to things, in exactly the same way you will. At some point, for your own peace of mind, it really helps to accept that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Now that he is an adult and can do whatever he wants, that is what he does, regardless of how it affects other people.  We often argue that he doesn&#39;t help out enough with the kids or spend enough time playing with and connecting with them.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nArguing with him isn&#39;t likely to make the idea of connecting with his children more attractive. If you want to help him connect more, you can look for ways to help him do that - to make the idea of spending time with his children something that makes him feel good. Look for ways to set him and the kids up for success together, ways for him to feel positive and successful and an imporant part of his kids&#39; world. Tell him stories about your days that make him smile. Find ways for him to do fun, special things with the kids when he has the energy to do them. That&#39;s more work for you in the short run, but the better he feels about being a dad, his children&#39;s dad, the more he&#39;ll choose to engage with them. That&#39;s human nature - we do things that feel good. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Here is another issue: my daughter hates getting her hair combed and braided.  She screams bloody murder. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nMo is like that. We&#39;ve long since stopped trying to brush or comb her hair. For awhile she was happy cutting it (herself), but now she wants it long. If she had the kind of hair that dreds easily we&#39;d have discussed that, but her hair is very fine, so it just looks messy. She&#39;s very active, so I suspect it would always look messy even if she combed it a dozen times a day ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; My husband is 100% against it and says we should let her decide.  She is less than two.  I think her screaming is a way of saying she wants it cut.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is she with scissors? Honestly, my own experience with a very young child cutting her own hair was that she was very very careful about not poking herself or snipping her ears (but couldn&#39;t hold still well enough for me to avoid the same hazards). Young kids often don&#39;t care a whole lot either way about the length of their hair, but they also don&#39;t like adults taking the matter out of their hands. If she doesn&#39;t have the coordination to use scissors, yet, maybe she&#39;d like to hold out locks of hair for you to snip at her direction. Make it fun *and* her decision. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] parenting differences .  . .","postDate":"1251449263","msgId":41153,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ1Nzc4My4zMDc3OS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGg3N2JmOSs5amNiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg3N2JmOSs5amNiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41151,"nextInTopic":41155,"prevInTime":41152,"nextInTime":41154,"topicId":41151,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sometimes it can make a difference if you see the brighter side of things instead of the downside.

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1931963552\">Sometimes it can make a difference if you see the brighter side of things instead of the downside. He was caring for your child during the airplane flight. I can remember flying to the UK with baby Simon and walking the circuit of the aisles, round and round and round, with him. Linnaea even more so. The flights to Australia had lots of exercise for me. And lots of smiles and excuse us as we walked past people&#39;s legs for the 15th time. Maybe next flight you and he could take turns with each child. When he needs a break he could take your younger child and you could do the circuit and the nearness for safety concern. Sometimes agreeing to take one child or the other needs to be renegotiated again and again. Or not, just passed over and switched around. Maybe he sat down and let your daughter do what she was doing because he was tired of standing up. Maybe he needed a break. <br/>\n<br/>\nArguing with someone about their lack of care is a sure way to make them feel more and more resentful about the caring they do. I know if someone nags me about something I am far more loathe to do it. And if I do end up doing whatever it was I was being hassled to do, it is with far less pleasure and far more slamming and muttering than I would have done if I&#39;d come to it in my own time and my own way. If you live the life you love and make it accessible and inviting to your partner it will be much more appealling for him to join in than it will ever be if you nag and argue with him. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is normal to have differences from your partner. Differences that may have attracted you in the first place. He won&#39;t ever be the same parent as you are. He won&#39;t make the same choices. And the relationships that he has with his children will be different to the ones you have with them. He gets to make those relationships, they are his to make. Micromanaging them won&#39;t help him and they won&#39;t help you or your children. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the hair, neither Simon nor Linnaea have ever been keen on getting their hair brushed. Simon used to hate getting his head wet even. So they had tangled hair. Simon&#39;s never really tangled that much, but Linnaea still has hair that can be matted at the back and frizzy at the front. I&#39;ve gone months without brushing her hair. There are occasions when I&#39;ve told her that she&#39;ll be better received if she has brushed hair and she&#39;s agreed, and times when she hasn&#39;t agreed. I&#39;m willing to take the hit of social disapproval for her comfort. Linnaea never minded getting her head wet, so I&#39;ve usually just doused her with conditioner and finger combed out the worst of the tangles. At 9 she prefers that it be combed out, although not every time. When she was 2, David loved her hair being wild and untamed. It would bother me, and he would tell me that it was such a beautiful thing, such an expression of her through her hair, like Medusa and the snakes. It was<br/>\n good to have his voice to calm my fears. Your daughter isn&#39;t even 2 yet, I would let her hair be tangled and messy and try and find ways to see it as a beautiful thing than to look for ways to try and get it to fit in with what other people want of her. Figure out how to smile at the dreadlocks. Sometimes that&#39;s hard, but when it does work, the joy just bubbles through you. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: lidjalynne05 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:princessjasmine05@...\">princessjasmine05@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, 28 August, 2009 2:21:45 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] parenting differences .  . .<br/>\n<br/>\nI am just diving into the unschooling adventure.  I wrote a few weeks ago about some problems I was having with my toddler and got lots of great support for the solutions I basically came up with, plus some ways to adjust my thinking which were really helpful.  I feel like I&#39;ve made a lot of progress in a one step forward, two steps back kind of way and am excited to be on this journey.  However, I feel like my husband and I have different approaches and expectations in parenting that are getting in our way. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is pretty young (25 years old) and had the experience of feeling disempowered as a child, without enough power and without the ability or opportunity to negotiate to get his needs and wants satisfied.  He threw tantrums until he was about 11 years old.  Pretty wild ones, I hear.  He has told me he feels his father was basically running the show, and that however daddy wanted things was the way they went.  Now that he is an adult and can do whatever he wants, that is what he does, regardless of how it affects other people.  We often argue that he doesn&#39;t help out enough with the kids or spend enough time playing with and connecting with them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother problem is that he doesn&#39;t seem to put the children&#39;s safety first.  He often brags that he lets our kids do whatever they want, although the reality is that he lets them do whatever they want as long as it doesn&#39;t inconvenience him.  One example of this lack of regard for safety happened on our recent flight.  He was &quot;responsible&quot; for our daughter and I was in charge of the baby.  He let our daughter run all up and down the airplane basically alone.  He let her climb in the seats and then laughed when there was turbulence and she was shaking back and forth in the seat.  He watched her from his seat, which was maybe 5 or more rows away.  I think I would allow her to do many of the same things and just stand closer to be there in case she needed support.  He is willing to let the kids do risky things from a distance and says if they get hurt they will learn from it and that they have to take responsibility for their choices.  He will advise them<br/>\n not to do something and then sit back and let them do something dangerous.  There are limits of course, he won&#39;t let them go into the highway or something.  But it feels to me that he isn&#39;t present enough.  The only thing I could come up with is that if he isn&#39;t being there like I would like, I could just be present myself.  We have talked about it and I don&#39;t think he sees anything wrong with his choices, and maybe I am overreacting?  I am still working at not being too restrictive b/c of potential dangers and finding ways to make dangerous things safer.  And I am also working hard not to let what I think others are thinking about me stop me from letting the kids do things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is another issue: my daughter hates getting her hair combed and braided.  She screams bloody murder.  We have tried giving her interactive toys, turning on the tv, letting her play in the tub, etc., and nothing seems to work.  Sometimes it is easier than others, but mostly she just doesn&#39;t like it.  I wanted to cut her hair.  My husband is 100% against it and says we should let her decide.  She is less than two.  I think her screaming is a way of saying she wants it cut.  We have worked to meet all of our needs but are not coming up with anything.
