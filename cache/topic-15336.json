I took to unschooling instantly - &quot;got  <br/>\nit&quot; - knew it was right, knew it was what we&#39;d do. It felt natural to  <br/>\nme - it was a logical and easy extension of the way I&#39;d been raised  <br/>\nand the way I&#39;d lived with my babies and toddlers.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut STILL I resort to yelling and guilt-inducing and sometimes get so  <br/>\nfrustrated and angry that I say things I thoroughly regret. Each new  <br/>\nage of kids (and adults) - each new stage - brings new challenges and  <br/>\nwe have new things to learn about ourselves and how we react.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has helped me is this:  In the midst of reacting in a way I  <br/>\nreally don&#39;t want to act, a little voice in my head says, &quot;Think of  <br/>\ntwo options first.&quot; What that means is that I&#39;m telling myself to not  <br/>\nreact until I&#39;m choosing the best of at least two possible reactions.  <br/>\nSo - I quickly think - &quot;YELL!&quot; because that is what is about to come  <br/>\nout, and then I think &quot;OR ......&quot; - and I force myself to think of  <br/>\nsomething else. Often, that much of a pause is enough to get me to  <br/>\nthink of what someone on this list has previously suggested - hug,  <br/>\ntouch, breathe, etc. So I choose the better of the two alternatives.  <br/>\nEVEN if my urge is to throw something and the only other alternative  <br/>\nI can think of is to slam a door - slamming a door is a better  <br/>\nalternative (usually). It is a PROCESS - and getting the habit of  <br/>\nchoosing between at least two options is a HUGE big step in that  <br/>\nprocess - if that can become a habit, then you&#39;ll find that you start  <br/>\nto choose between better and better options.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160045678,"authorName":"seccotine_ch","from":"&quot;seccotine_ch&quot; &lt;seccotine@...&gt;","profile":"seccotine_ch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: First days of vacation","postDate":"1152354697","msgId":15454,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU4bzFpOStrYWptQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA3MDcxMTAwaDQxNWUyN2JidDc1ODQzMzcwZTMwN2FhZjZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15438,"nextInTopic":15457,"prevInTime":15453,"nextInTime":15455,"topicId":15336,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Michelle and Pam, thank you so much for your answers ...

While I was <br/>\nwalking in the countryside, watching the beautiful changing sky, I <br/>\nfelt the tension leaving my body. I realised that during the day, I <br/>\nget more and more tensed, and suddenly, I explode for a little <br/>\nincident ... I was wondering if there were a way to relax physically <br/>\nin order to avoid these outbursts ...  (though I don&#39;t know, between <br/>\nthe physical tension and the mental one which is the hen and which <br/>\nis the egg ...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that the problem is the shift from segmented/specialised <br/>\ntimes to the more organic/intertwined life I&#39;m experiencing now. I <br/>\nhave to find new marks. By reading your posts, I realise that I am <br/>\nsuch a beginner in this new life, that this is something so<br/>\ndifferent (not only the radical unschooling thing, but also <br/>\nthe &quot;living together&quot; one), that this is not surprising if I <br/>\nfeel lost and not good at it ... <br/>\n<br/>\nPam, I really liked the way you told me that I couldn&#39;t afford self-<br/>\npity - it was so empowering ! I absolutely agree with you. I&#39;m not <br/>\ndepressed, actually, I usually feel very privileged and happy, but <br/>\nyesterday, I was this miserable little thing who &quot;didn&#39;t even know <br/>\nwhat to cook for luhuhuhunch&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote about it, because I have moments like this from time to <br/>\ntime, though they&#39;re only moments, where I feel at loss and <br/>\noverwhelmed by the huge responsibility of being a parent ... but I <br/>\nnotice that it happens mostly when I loose touch with my children <br/>\n(which was very the case yesterday). <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one of the reasons why I like so much the way you, radical <br/>\nunschoolers, talk about parenting. When I read you, it really feel <br/>\nlike : yes, this is truth. And the reason why I feel that is not <br/>\nthat I&#39;m inclined to follow a new guru - it is because what you say <br/>\nspeaks directly to the life in me (what I tried to translate once <br/>\nby &quot;talking to my cells&quot;), the part which has remained undamaged and <br/>\nwhich is constantly seeking for healing forces. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is also why I felt so strange this week, because on the one <br/>\nhand, I read words which were driving me in the right track (sorry <br/>\nfor the image, cannot find my words to express what I really felt <br/>\nhere) and on the other hand, there was something (what ???) <br/>\nresisting in me, which makes me act in complete contradiction with <br/>\nmy beliefs - at the moment where my beliefs where so much reinforced <br/>\nby my readings. (Does anybody understand what I&#39;m writing here ?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not looking for excuses, I&#39;m trying to understand what&#39;s going <br/>\non in me :) Ren said in another post that unschooling was such a <br/>\nhealing process, and I really think that too - but I&#39;m always <br/>\nsurprised (though it is not the first time) with the resistance and <br/>\nfights such a process encounters.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany, many thanks. I really appreciate your bluntness AND <br/>\nkindness - and also all these practical, down to the earth pieces of <br/>\nadvice you give, which are sooo helpful ? useful ? don&#39;t know, but <br/>\npriceless anyway :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle/Melbrig√∞a","from":"&quot;=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Michelle/Melbrig=F0a?=&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: First days of vacation","postDate":"1152295259","msgId":15438,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA3MDcxMTAwaDQxNWUyN2JidDc1ODQzMzcwZTMwN2FhZjZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGU4bHVscytsa2J2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDQ0QUQzMTRDLjcwODA0MDZAYWRlbHBoaWEubmV0PiA8ZThsdWxzK2xrYnZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15437,"nextInTopic":15454,"prevInTime":15437,"nextInTime":15439,"topicId":15336,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I had to respond to this part of your original post: So we spend our mornings in our (tiny) garden, then we flow back inside, close everything and wait for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-191565345\">I had to respond to this part of your original post:<br/>\n&quot;So we spend our mornings in our (tiny) garden, then we flow back<br/>\ninside, close everything and wait for the sun to turn - and at five,<br/>\nwe live again.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI could have written that but it would look more like:  So we spend<br/>\nour springs in our (tiny) garden, then we flow back inside, close<br/>\neverything and wait for the seasons to turn - and at autumn we live<br/>\nagain.&quot;  :-)  We are not summer people (so what the heck are we doing<br/>\nliving in  Florida?).

In fact for a short while (even though I only<br/>\nworked when Emily was a few months old and have been a SAHM since) I<br/>\nactually waited for my co-parent to get home before doing *anything.*<br/>\nIt was like we waited for his arrival to begin our lives.

For a while I was<br/>\ntaking myself to the movies and going to the showings that started at<br/>\n9:30 or 10:00 at night because I knew our baby would be in his long<br/>\nslumber at that time and not wake up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have the feeling they would like me to initiate things, but I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know what to do with them : I love reading stories, I love<br/>\n&gt; discussing with them, I love going with them ... anywhere, the fact<br/>\n&gt; of being together ...

My kids are now 15, 18, and 21 and I just had to  <br/>\nmake a lunch date with my 21 year old in order to be sure I&#39;d even  <br/>\nSEE her in the next week. It won&#39;t last - really!  I remember feeling  <br/>\nthe same way you do after I left my regular full-time employment to  <br/>\nstay home with my little ones - I felt like my whole day went by with  <br/>\nnothing &quot;done&quot; and like I&#39;d never get to do something satisfying to  <br/>\nmyself ever again. What I &quot;did&quot; about that was to get super into  <br/>\nreading about child development and about learning and then I&#39;d keep  <br/>\nmy focus on my own kids - watching, observing them. I kept a journal  <br/>\n- just jotted down little notes like: &quot;Rosie seems to be guessing  <br/>\nwhat words are based on the first letter,&quot; or &quot;Roxana needs needs to  <br/>\nbe left alone when she&#39;s upset - not comforted immediately.&quot; Keeping  <br/>\na journal (even though it was sometimes 3 or 4 words in an entry  <br/>\nbecause that&#39;s all the time I got) helped me feel more like something  <br/>\nwas &quot;happening&quot; while getting my focus more clearly on the kids - out  <br/>\nof my own head. And - I always had a book going, but I had to learn  <br/>\nto read in bits - not like how I read before, in long uninterrupted  <br/>\nstretches. Nonfiction works way better for this than fiction - so  <br/>\nthere were about 18 years of me reading almost entirely nonfiction -  <br/>\nuntil I got back into fiction a couple of years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - it REALLY helped to take the kids out of the house to a public  <br/>\narea where there might be other parents. Even when my kids were  <br/>\nschool age and the other parents only had toddlers and babies, it  <br/>\ngave me someone to talk to who understood how to carry on a  <br/>\nconversation in the midst of constant interruption. Where I live, it  <br/>\nis easy to start up a conversation with another parent - just stand  <br/>\nwatching the kids on the playground and say, &quot;Oh, your little boy is  <br/>\nso cute - look how well he&#39;s climbing that ladder. How old is he?&quot;  <br/>\nParents here are open to conversations with other parents. I&#39;m not  <br/>\nsure that is the case everywhere, I know in Germany people didn&#39;t  <br/>\nseem to commonly talk to strangers in public settings like we do  <br/>\nhere. But, if that works where you are, it is a great way to have a  <br/>\nlittle adult conversation during the day.  In rainy weather I&#39;d take  <br/>\nthe kids to a shopping mall just to buy a cookie and I&#39;d have a cup  <br/>\nof coffee (that someone ELSE had made - it was a treat!).<br/>\n<br/>\nALSO - I had a mother&#39;s helper - a teenage girl who came in and  <br/>\nplayed with the kids while I was there, in the house, but went off to  <br/>\ndo my own thing for a while. I worked from home during some periods  <br/>\nof time - other times I just went and took a bath and read a book in  <br/>\nthe tub. Sometimes I made phone calls. The time went fast - but I  <br/>\nthink even an hour or two a couple of times per week could make a  <br/>\nHUGE difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also know that it<br/>\n&gt; would be better if I were truly with them, instead of being half<br/>\n&gt; there, half thinking of my various to-do lists ... but I can&#39;t help<br/>\n&gt; it (yet)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes you can - you can help it. You can do better for an hour, for  <br/>\nexample. You can tell yourself: &quot;For the next hour I&#39;m on vacation  <br/>\nwith my kids and we have nothing to do but have fun together.&quot; So do  <br/>\nthat for an hour. Then tell the kids, &quot;Okay, now I&#39;m on work time and  <br/>\nwon&#39;t be paying as much attention for the next hour.&quot; Alternate like  <br/>\nthat. What you end up with is half your time with full focus on the  <br/>\nkids and half the time partially focused on them and partially on  <br/>\ngetting other stuff done. That&#39;s FINE! That&#39;s awesome!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I feel quite depressed today, because when I began to read you (and<br/>\n&gt; Sandra and Joyce&#39;s sites), it really had an impact in my ways with<br/>\n&gt; the kids, I really felt more patient and relaxed ... and now that I<br/>\n&gt; do have time, I&#39;m stressed out again, and I yell again ... IT&#39;s as<br/>\n&gt; if I had too much responsibilities and I don&#39;t feel like I can do<br/>\n&gt; it. This morning, as I burst into cries, hidden behind a wall of<br/>\n&gt; toilet paper in the supermaket, I was thinking &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have all<br/>\n&gt; these kids, I&#39;m not able to take care of them as they deserve, etc.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sweetie - you don&#39;t get the luxury of self-pity (even if you deserve  <br/>\nit). You do have kids and they need a happy mommy. So you do owe it  <br/>\nto them to take care of yourself. Do you get enough sleep, eat well,  <br/>\nget a little regular exercise? If you really are a little depressed,  <br/>\ntry St. John&#39;s Wort - it works great for mild to moderate depression.  <br/>\nIf you think you&#39;re seriously depressed please see a doctor - you can  <br/>\ntake an anti-depressant for a while, jump start yourself and begin  <br/>\nfeeling like having more fun in your life again, and pretty soon you  <br/>\nmight not need the medications. Also, I have a friend who goes out  <br/>\nEVERY Friday night by herself or with girlfriends. She almost always  <br/>\ngoes to a movie - she picks artsy interesting movies that her husband  <br/>\nprobably wouldn&#39;t even want to see. She&#39;s done this every Friday  <br/>\nnight for probably 12 years or more. Would a night out help? Having  <br/>\nsomething like that to look forward to this WEEK?<br/>\n<br/>\nI never liked to play &quot;Little People&quot; or dolls or any of that stuff  <br/>\nwith my kids. They could tell. So - occasionally I&#39;d be part of their  <br/>\nplay, but they&#39;d have to tell me what to do &lt;G&gt;. It wasn&#39;t that  <br/>\nsatisfying to any of us - they didn&#39;t ask it of me too often. But I  <br/>\ndid lots of other things with them. I don&#39;t think adults need to be  <br/>\nwatching kids play and cheering them on or anything - just be  <br/>\navailable, you don&#39;t have to be part of it all the time, or even most  <br/>\nof the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of things you might enjoy, yourself, that you could share with  <br/>\nthe kids.

Usually, I like being with <br/>\nthem, following their games, reading them stories ... But I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow why, this week, it&#39;s not at all like this. Maybe it&#39;s because <br/>\nI&#39;m not used to spend my whole day with somebody (I&#39;m a rather <br/>\nsolitary person), and it&#39;s hard for me to take other habits ... <br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s because I find hard to be on call, like that, all day <br/>\nlong ... Maybe it&#39;s the fact of being the only person in charge - I <br/>\nguess that there must be a little bit of that, because I can feel <br/>\nthe tension go when my husband comes back - even when he does <br/>\nnothing but reading the paper ... <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I don&#39;t know why, all I&#39;m thinking of is &quot;getting a little <br/>\nspace for me&quot; ... I try to control that, I think : you were so sad <br/>\nleaving them all the time, and you&#39;ll see, before you even know it, <br/>\nthey&#39;ll leave home, enjoy while they&#39;re here ... They won&#39;t always <br/>\nneed you so much and you&#39;ll even miss the constant interruptions ... <br/>\n<br/>\nI have the feeling they would like me to initiate things, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what to do with them : I love reading stories, I love <br/>\ndiscussing with them, I love going with them ... anywhere, the fact <br/>\nof being together ... I&#39;m not so good in playing with toys (I mean : <br/>\nI can have a great fun playing in the pool, jumping, splashing, all <br/>\nthese, but give me a Playmobil soldier and I suddenly feel goofy and <br/>\nstupid ...). I&#39;m not very good in being there just in case, when <br/>\nSylvain plays with the computer, for instance, and asks for help <br/>\nagain and again ... <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I think that&#39;s the most difficult for me is to be there, at <br/>\ntheir disposal, and knowing that I can&#39;t do anything for me, whether <br/>\nit is for my pleasure or because it needs to be done, because I know <br/>\nthat I&#39;ll be interrupted again and again ... I also know that it <br/>\nwould be better if I were truly with them, instead of being half <br/>\nthere, half thinking of my various to-do lists ... but I can&#39;t help <br/>\nit (yet)<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel quite depressed today, because when I began to read you (and <br/>\nSandra and Joyce&#39;s sites), it really had an impact in my ways with <br/>\nthe kids, I really felt more patient and relaxed ... and now that I <br/>\ndo have time, I&#39;m stressed out again, and I yell again ...

Next year at this time, if you keep making <br/>\nprogress, you will just be starting to truly &quot;unschool&quot; - so give <br/>\nyourself a break and realize it is a process - a long process. <br/>\n<br/>\n My recommendation to you is to drop all the &quot;shoulds&quot;.  Every time you <br/>\nfeel like you &quot;should&quot; do something, but you don&#39;t really feel like it <br/>\n(whether because of energy levels or whatever), then don&#39;t do it!  <br/>\nDeschooling at this point is about learning to honor your self, your <br/>\nenergy levels.  Do what you want to do, not what you feel you should do <br/>\nor feel that you have to do.  If you can&#39;t do that for yourself, how <br/>\nwill you ever do it for your children?  Unschooling is about trusting <br/>\nand honoring the desires/rhythyms of ourselves and our children.  Keep <br/>\nreminding yourself you are on summer break - you are taking a break from <br/>\neverything. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you want to lay around, lay around!  If you can&#39;t bring yourself <br/>\nto clean the house or feel resistance every time you think &quot;I should <br/>\nclean the house&quot; than don&#39;t do it.  What do you feel like doing?  What <br/>\ndo the kids feel like doing?  Do those things.  You are probably all <br/>\nexhausted from pushing yourselves when you should have been resting and <br/>\nnow you will need a long break to catch up.  Begin unschooling by <br/>\nhonoring that; by ignoring all the &quot;shoulds&quot; that keep echoing around in <br/>\nyour head and do what you feel like doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is that you feel like your children are exhausting you because <br/>\nyou are not honoring what you need and what they need.  It is exhuasting <br/>\nto push/control people constantly.  You are probably not even aware that <br/>\nyou are doing it - it has become so second nature to you that you are <br/>\nunaware that it is happening.  I fall into this trap too, and my biggest <br/>\nindication that it is happening again is when my energy levels drop and <br/>\nI feel like I am dragging everyone along.  When this happens, I know I <br/>\nam &quot;going against the grain&quot; and I need to give myself a time-out.  And <br/>\nI usually need to drop my expectations about what &quot;should&quot; be happening. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour time with your children should be enjoyable.  What are you pushing <br/>\nyourself to do with them that feels like such a drain?  Are you laughing <br/>\nand having fun together?  Are you cuddling in bed and reading to them?  <br/>\nAre you letting them lead the activities or are you organizing <br/>\nactivities and making them do it?  Having some time to yourself is fine <br/>\nbut I get the impression from your letter that your time with your <br/>\nchildren is not enjoyable, not nourishing and therefore you have to take <br/>\nbreaks or avoid it, if possible.
