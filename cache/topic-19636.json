But it is slight and <br/>\nbarely replicated. That is, the effect seems to be very slight, and only <br/>\noccurs in very tight studies of behavior and ADHD children and not within <br/>\nthe population as a whole, and it is only occasionally found by researchers. <br/>\nAnd even among ADHD participants the results seem to not be particularly <br/>\ntight. And while there are allergies to foods, things like celiacs, or the <br/>\nmilk allergy I had as a child, it doesn&#39;t always remain, I can drink milk <br/>\ntell the cows come home, and then drink what they bring. Nor is it something <br/>\nthat all children have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is all to say that Deb is absolutely right, it is easy to blame <br/>\nexternal factors (I blame PMS at least once a month) when it is something <br/>\nthat a parent could address more readily, more directly, with care and <br/>\nattention. It seems that if someone&#39;s child isn&#39;t reacting to anything <br/>\nseverely than maybe it isn&#39;t a culprit anymore. And making the world <br/>\nsmaller, shrinking the food available to them, deciding that video games are <br/>\ninherently violent, unschooling everything but math and reading, it isn&#39;t <br/>\nunschooling anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:d.lewis@...\">d.lewis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &quot;unschoolingbasics&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, December 15, 2006 7:33 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Questions from an absolute newcomer to this <br/>\nidea...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ***she doesn&#39;t have reactions that are severe or necessarily immediate so<br/>\n&gt; pinpointing the culprits can be difficult.***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I asked because I have seen parents blame perfectly normal kid behaviors <br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; foods or chemical additives when the kid is FINE and the parent happens to<br/>\n&gt; be extremely sensitive.

She is also allergic to food dye, corn, gluten and wheat.  Bottom line for us is keeping healthy food in the house.  Whole foods, not much processed, or packaged stuff.  I keep foods that are within her diet around.  I spend a lot of money at the health food store.  I&#39;ve kindly asked my neighbors not to feed her that she is allergic.  Most candy has corn syrup and dye in it so if a neighbor is handing that stuff out I&#39;ve told Mariah she can come home for some homemade cookies or organic chocolate.  We pack a cooler practically everywhere we go, so we won&#39;t be tempted to stop at McDonalds.......but we do eat at McDonald&#39;s occasionally for a treat.  I don&#39;t limit what or how much food she eats here at the house.  Right now she is in a growth spurt and eating me out of house or home.  Both my girls eat mostly whole foods with lots of fruits and vegy&#39;s so I know they are healthy and I don&#39;t worry.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:daintreepixie@...\">daintreepixie@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">           --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, kbcdlovejo@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yeah---but it all boils down to the fact that you can&#39;t teach what <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; learner does not want to learn.

Rowan (who&#39;s 10) was not interested, but<br/>\nDagny said sure.  The reporter interviewed her via email.  It was the night<br/>\nbefore we left for a vacation, so Dagny was busy getting ready.  She had no<br/>\ntime between reading the questions and responding, and not much time to<br/>\nwrite.  Here&#39;s what she sent him:<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************************************************<br/>\nWhat do you remember of school?<br/>\nSince it was 9 years ago, there are only bits and pieces left of what I<br/>\nremember. I remember a lot of feeling confused. I remember the first day,<br/>\nwhen I met one of my best friends who I still keep in touch with. I remember<br/>\nwondering why these adults would yell at us for feeling like learning<br/>\nsomething besides what we &quot;needed&quot; to know. I remember being bullied. I<br/>\nremember having my birthday at school, having to wait in line for food and<br/>\nhaving to ask to go to the bathroom - and sometimes being told no, which is<br/>\nunfathomable to me. I remember being warned there would be a fire drill that<br/>\nday and not being able to sit still because I was so stressed out about it,<br/>\nthe day my parents asked me if I wanted to &quot;home school&quot; and the day I<br/>\ndecided to wait until the end of the year because I didn&#39;t want to lose<br/>\ntouch with my friends (after nine years, I still know most of them).<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did it compare to your daily life since then?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daily life now is whatever I want it to be. It can involve anything from<br/>\nhiking up a hill with my friends and taking pictures and enjoying the cool<br/>\nair and lovely view to lying in bed reading for half of the day, to doing a<br/>\nbunch of errands, to learning how to sew a zipper on a bag. But it always<br/>\ninvolves, through every minute - even every second of it - learning<br/>\nsomething new.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you like about being an unschooler?<br/>\n<br/>\nI like being respected by adults and 2 year olds alike and I like being able<br/>\nto have the time and resources to be very interested in what I like doing<br/>\n(Sewing, Photography, Makeup Art, Writing, Creating Music, Learning how to<br/>\nbe friendlier to our environment).<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nI typed papers for other kids in college.

ALL things are equally available <br/>\nas <br/>\n&gt; much as I can make them so. If they choose to read, reading must be <br/>\n&gt; what they want to do at that moment.

Yet he wrote an article for an e-zine---and <br/>\nwas <br/>\n&gt; published. It was an actual assignment and the first thing he&#39;d <br/>\nwritten <br/>\n&gt; since he turned 13.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s written in his journal. He&#39;s written poetry. And yet, he was <br/>\n&gt; capable of writing a published article. How do you think that <br/>\nhappens?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Because he wanted to.

Netflix all the <br/>\nmovies <br/>\n&gt; in a genre---horror (look at the old costumes with zippers vs the <br/>\nnew <br/>\n&gt; special FX), war (pick a war---zillions of each war), anime (in <br/>\n&gt; Japanese), comedy (Tom Hanks), sci-fi, ittle Rascals/Three <br/>\n&gt; Stooges/Buster Keaton/Charlie Chaplin--- or Shakespeare---go PLAY!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t need to set up a &quot;compare and contrast&quot; situaton or <br/>\n&gt; discussion afterwards. It happens naturally as you move through the <br/>\n&gt; movies.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; DON&#39;T make an issue out of it. Just watch for fun. I&#39;m guessing <br/>\nyour <br/>\n&gt; kids are too smart to &quot;buy&quot; into a planned discussion. Just let it <br/>\n&gt; flow.

ALL things are equally available as <br/>\nmuch as I can make them so. If they choose to read, reading must be <br/>\nwhat they want to do at that moment.  And yes, both choose to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, we let them live and answer questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI am tired of trying to teach only for them to figure it out on their <br/>\nown.<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah---they&#39;re amazing like athat, aren&#39;t they?

You see some value in it? Teaching when there&#39;s no <br/>\nlearning happening?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow&#39;s that working for you? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd by that I mean, I don&#39;t want them to be unable to<br/>\nwrite an essay in college. Really that&#39;s my only fear.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nPuh-leeze!<br/>\n<br/>\nOK---so your *only* fear is that one of your children won&#39;t be able to <br/>\nwrite an essay?<br/>\n<br/>\nReally?<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t make my son write a THING since we took him out of school at <br/>\nthe end of sixth grade. Yet he wrote an article for an e-zine---and was <br/>\npublished. It was an actual assignment and the first thing he&#39;d written <br/>\nsince he turned 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s written in his journal. He&#39;s written poetry. And yet, he was <br/>\ncapable of writing a published article. How do you think that happens?<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause he wanted to. It was important to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if I make it &quot;seem&quot; like we aren&#39;t having class that will be <br/>\nunschooling???<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow smart are they? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Like watch movies and discuss them?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNice start. How about just watching movies---LOTS of them. Do a <br/>\n&quot;vertical&quot;--- watch all the Johnny Depp movies or all the Jack <br/>\nNicholson movies. Or Steven Spielberg in order. Netflix all the movies <br/>\nin a genre---horror (look at the old costumes with zippers vs the new <br/>\nspecial FX), war (pick a war---zillions of each war), anime (in <br/>\nJapanese), comedy (Tom Hanks), sci-fi, ittle Rascals/Three <br/>\nStooges/Buster Keaton/Charlie Chaplin--- or Shakespeare---go PLAY!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to set up a &quot;compare and contrast&quot; situaton or <br/>\ndiscussion afterwards. It happens naturally as you move through the <br/>\nmovies.<br/>\n<br/>\nDON&#39;T make an issue out of it. Just watch for fun. I&#39;m guessing your <br/>\nkids are too smart to &quot;buy&quot; into a planned discussion. Just let it <br/>\nflow. Have FUN!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI obviously don&#39;t know HOW TO DO THIS. LOL Help!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n From today onward, you are on vacation. School does not exist---LIVE as <br/>\nif it did not exist! How would you show your children the WORLD??? Be <br/>\ntheir guide and translator (of course in some things, they&#39;re be YOUR <br/>\nguide and translator! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nBring home new things. Don&#39;t get upset if they don&#39;t find them <br/>\nfascinating. They may not. Do You? Cool enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo things YOU have always wanted. Plant a garden. Get bees. Chickens! <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  Write a short story. Teach your dog trciks. Let your kids see that <br/>\nyou are learning too. They&#39;ll catch on.<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-=---<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are taking this month off school and I really want to re-organize<br/>\nhow our days go.

He will learn when he is ready and when <br/>\nhe feels it&#39;s important to him.

I&#39;ve been a homeschooling mom for 7 years now. In the<br/>\nbeginning we had one son, I used a curriculum, sat at the kitchen<br/>\ntable, said the pledge to the flag and the whole 9 yards. That was<br/>\nthen...Now I have 5 children. All boys who are ages 14, 9, 6 and<br/>\n3 year old twins. Now that there are so many kids hanging<br/>\naround our home, I have enough time to teach a little about reading<br/>\ndo some math worksheets and until recently felt overwhelmed with &quot;Are<br/>\nthey learning enough.&quot; Then last month, our eldest son, who told me<br/>\nthat he doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s learning anything in homeschool, took a<br/>\ncollege entrance exam and passed with flying colors. Our 9 year old,<br/>\nwho I tried to teach to read for the past year, learned to read only<br/>\nwhen we were on a break from school. &quot;How?&quot; you ask...Pretty much by<br/>\nplaying video games online!  I&#39;ve recently been e-mailing some fun <br/>\nunschooling families and they have given me some insight as to how <br/>\nthier families unschool.  I would love to hear from more seasoned <br/>\nunschoolers. By that I mean parents whose children are grown. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay so here is my question to you seasoned unschoolers. How exactly<br/>\nis the learning accomplished in unschooling? Is it sort of an<br/>\norganized chaos? By that I mean, do you stack the odds in your home<br/>\nin favor of learning? Do you place books around and ask them to<br/>\nchoose one or do you put limits on tv and games so they get bored<br/>\nenough to read or do you ask them to write but write about whatever<br/>\ntickles their fancy or do you just let them live and when they have a<br/>\nquestion answer it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am tired of trying to teach only for them to figure it out on their<br/>\nown.

Really that&#39;s my only fear. Maybe if I<br/>\nmake it &quot;seem&quot; like we aren&#39;t having class that will be<br/>\nunschooling??? Like watch movies and discuss them? I obviously don&#39;t<br/>\nknow HOW TO DO THIS. LOL Help!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are taking this month off school and I really want to re-organize<br/>\nhow our days go.
