Think of this way as an adult would anyone make you take a bite of something that looked icky? Somethings look icky to kids. I know with my son when were trying to get him to eat his veggies at dinner it was setting up for a meltdown. Then we thought about it, when we had a garden he would eat all the veggies fresh and raw from the vine. So he doesn&#39;t like cooked veggies. When we asked him why he doesn&#39;t like &quot;smushy&quot; things. He likes his veggies crunchy and cold, so raw it is. We have also gone from set meal times to having food available and being offered when we notice signs of hunger. To be honest we are a family of grazers so we just set food up that way. More so during the warm weather, none of us get very hungry when we get hot. So I keep monkey platters available to everyone. I add something new from time to time and everyone will just grab it if they feel like it. We try to offer but if we get a no we back<br/>\n off, the meltdowns are just not worth it. Most recently sunflower seeds have been the new food. My son calls them bird seeds and thinks it is neat that he is eating bird food. It just tickles him to death. 3 months ago he thought his parents had grown a third eye by offering them to him. It doesn&#39;t hurt to offer and say you think this is really great and be enthusiastic about anything, food, a book, moive, etc. Kids are individuals with their own dislikes and likes just as we grown ups are. When they are ready they will try something new but there is comfort in the status quo as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love watching my kids when they do decide to &quot;broaden their horizons&quot;. It is so much more enjoyable when they make these discoveries on their own. And we have learned not to say, &quot;Now see, I told you so.&quot; or some variation of that.

That&#39;s a pretty creepy idea if you think about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nPreview movies for him with an ear to the soundtrack, if that bothers him. Give him the remote control so he can mute things that start to stress him out - put the whole thing on subtitles if you have to. Many kids are freaked out by scary music. Its there to Be Scary! For that matter, the sounds in a movie are often calculated to create a certain mood. I&#39;ve seen &quot;commentaries&quot; of movies where the director admits to screening the movie with different music or sound fx to get some scenes past the censors. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] &quot;broadening horizons&quot; WAS Question about ds&#39;s intense interests","postDate":"1239560538","msgId":39456,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxMDk5My45NTE1MS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwOC5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGdydGFxNitmY3BkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdydGFxNitmY3BkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39455,"nextInTopic":39457,"prevInTime":39455,"nextInTime":39457,"topicId":39424,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If you push beyond the no repeatedly to get them to try something you enjoy, just one bite, than you are consistly eroding any trust they may have. When David and I first got together I was really adamant about not trying new foods. I would get really upset if he tried to get me to try something that I absolutely didn&#39;t want to try. A hangover from a childhood of having to try things, having to eat more than one bite. If pushed I couldn&#39;t actually taste the food. My desire not to try would push over into revulsion and I would gag over whatever it was. David quickly stopped asking me to try things. When he cooked he fixed lots of yummy food, keeping out all the things I didn&#39;t like. Over time I&#39;ve grown to trust his palate and his judgement of mine. I now will try most foods he asks me to taste. And usually I enjoy it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"&quot;broadening horizons&quot; WAS Question about ds&#39;s intense interests","postDate":"1239559814","msgId":39455,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdydGFxNitmY3BkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFBNDZDQURBQTcyMjQ2RTM5MUY3NjhBNUNBN0EzODMwQHJvYnlQQz4="},"prevInTopic":39454,"nextInTopic":39456,"prevInTime":39454,"nextInTime":39456,"topicId":39424,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************************ I m nodding my head in agreement and cringing at the same time.

Isn&#39;t that natural?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>************************<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m nodding my head in agreement and cringing at the same time. I do understand wanting to share my own enthusiasm and joy with the people I love - it Is natural! At the same time, I&#39;ve been the little kid with my mouth and eyes squeezed tight shut while someone coaxed me to &quot;just try it... just one bite&quot; &lt;deep shudder&gt;. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow children react to being coaxed to do things depends of specifics of personality and development. Many children are sensitive to smells and textures - some go in and out of phases of sensitivity, others are much more sensitive for longer periods of time. Mo&#39;s on the sensitive side. Right now she&#39;s going through a more intense stage where she doesn&#39;t even want to look at foods she doesn&#39;t like while she eats.<br/>\n<br/>\nRay always seemed sanguine about trying foods when he was younger - he had such an impressive appetite he&#39;d eat anything, it seemed. Now, though, he&#39;s become more conservative about what he eats and eschews a lot of foods he used to eat without comment. <br/>\n<br/>\nA cousin of mine used to have a strong preference for mild, light colored foods - she still does. For years she was coaxed, and then struggled on her own, to eat other things. Recently, after getting out of prescription drug rehab, she&#39;s started experimenting with Only eating the foods she finds appealing. She says she feels better for it - more in control of her life and body.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m saying is look at reactions and be as gentle as you possibly can. Trying new things is something that Might happen naturally with time - even my oh-so-sensitive 7yo sometimes tries new foods without the least prompting at all. But trying new things doesn&#39;t guarantee anything at all, not liking them, or becoming confident in trying new things. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: reading about violence WAS Question about ds&#39;s intense interests","postDate":"1239559064","msgId":39454,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdydGEybys0aHBqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdyc24zaitwcHFjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39453,"nextInTopic":39455,"prevInTime":39453,"nextInTime":39455,"topicId":39424,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~ So, am I to take it that research and discussion are bad words for unschoolers?~~ How did you come to that conclusion?

Either way, personality/genetics plays a huge part in our preferences and amount of sensitivity to various kinds of stimulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer shoot-em-up/drama/violence over a romantic comedy ANY day. I like guns. I like archery. I&#39;m drawn to the idea of taking karate or kung fu. I used to body build and do triathlon. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also LOVE ballet and plan to take classes soon, enjoy opera and good wine and bird watching. I work in the fashion industry and I love all things related to self-sufficiency (gardening, raising bees, collecting rain water, using non-electric devices etc..)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we try to understand things by putting them in boxes too much. If someone is drawn to war and weaponry they must be drawn to violence or end up desensitized, right? It&#39;s just not true though. Humans are much more complicated than all that. Interests can seem to be connected or they can seem to be all over the map. <br/>\n<br/>\n ~~Still, I think that at certain ages, children can only take so much of the violence or harsh realities that have gone on and still go on in the world.~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what is that age? It&#39;s different for everyone. Some people NEED to examine the dark side of life more than others. Harsh realities can lead to great compassion too. There is no magic age when a person can handle certain information, it&#39;s all about walking the path WITH our children and trusting them to learn from all of it, even if they learn they aren&#39;t ready to handle something they thought they could.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it makes you feel any better, my 19 y.o. became fascinated with the civil war when he was around 10 or 11. That fascination was fed with books and re-enactments and food from the era and the History channel. He became interested in WW1 and 2, then weaponry up to current times. He could tell you how many rounds an AK-47 or a .50 cal or even different kinds of tanks could fire per minute. He can cite the technological advances in warfare and weaponry. He played Grand Theft Auto and all sorts of VERY violent video games.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also protested the Iraq war when he was 13, day after day in downtown Pensacola where the mood was decidedly pro-war. He got flipped off by cops, watched altercations with pro-war, right-wing Christians and passionately protested the war each and every day in spite of all that. He is compassionate towards animals and children...can&#39;t stand to see a parent be mean to a child. He&#39;s gentle and thoughtful and very sweet. If being interested in wars and violent video games can turn you into a smart-ass with a warped sense of humor, then ok.:) But they don&#39;t desensitize you to violence, I can attest to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs fascinated as he is by weaponry and wars, he is equally as passionate about finding peaceful solutions and treating people with kindness. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t fear your child&#39;s interests. Trust that it will lead to exactly what HE needs for his journey. Adults rarely trusted most of my interests and I still made a career out of them. It just took me longer to trust my own passions....I don&#39;t want to create mistrust in my own children. That&#39;s all it does when we don&#39;t trust their interests or forbid certain things....creates mistrust.

When I read them myself as a little girl loving magic and books about schoolchildren but not the military at all, I nevertheless was quite engaged by the contrast between the violence and killing on one side versus the other, when used offensively versus defensively and for deeper magic versus self-aggrandizement, etc.  I think children intuitively appreciate that there is a difference between fighting to protect your friends and family against evil even though you hate violence, and the wicked kind of warfare because one is sociopathic . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ve been reading a new literary critique of Narnia as related to the real life education of CS Lewis, and the author (Salon dot com&#39;s Laura Miller) had a young girl&#39;s private experience with the books very much like mine. She cared about the magic, not the military. Yet she remembers after all these decades being fascinated by solemn, practical adventure-ready &quot;military&quot; advice that really is good life advice in any world, for example Aslan&#39;s reminder to the children about always cleaning one&#39;s sword, or how they learn to carry a bit of meat wrapped in leaves on missions because when one really needs food, whatever it is will taste wonderful . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.salon.com/books/excerpt/2008/12/06/laura_miller/index1.html\">http://www.salon.com/books/excerpt/2008/12/06/laura_miller/index1.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA final thought -- Harry Potter is chock full of world war violent warfare with these same moral lessons, more modern than my mom memories. :)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;JJ Ross&quot; &lt;jrossedd@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our 13-year-old son developed a similarly intense fascination with &quot;military history&quot; on about the same timeline described.

But then on his own through movies like Flyboys (the Lafayette Escadrille) and beautiful coffee table books, also library books even from the adult section &lt;grin&gt; he&#39;s connected to everything from Alexander the Great to the Vikings and the American Revolution.

My son is 6 and we&#39;re going to homeschool next year. With that in mind, he&#39;s exploring the history of armor and weapons (his idea, not mine). I think it grew out of an interest in guns he picked up at k-garten (one of the many reasons I&#39;m pulling him out of school). While I was initially a little disturbed at his choice of topic, as we read together and talk, I think there is a tremendous opportunity to show that violence is not a laudable thing, nor are wars always justified, interesting though the tools of warfare might be. While he might be too young to &quot;get&quot; that now, I&#39;m hopeful that repeated discussions and research over the years will enlighten him.

Not just desensitization (in the sense that they become so blaze&#39; or jaded by so much exposure to it -- they&#39;re so used to it that they don&#39;t get shocked anymore when they see some violence -- all because they&#39;ve had such a steady diet of it through books, films, etc., kwim?), but too-early exposure to the harsh realities of life could also develop fears in a child and a negativity about the world, that the world is a scary place to live in.  I agree with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that is also my concern.  But ds doesn&#39;t seem to be shocked or scared by what the POW&#39;s have gone through or some of the torture, etc. (Of course, he doesn&#39;t get too much of it -- ie. graphic details -- from the juvenile books, fiction or non-fiction -- at least, I try to make sure of that.)  And I&#39;m not about to let him watch &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; because he&#39;ll have, hopefully, 40 or 50 years of his adulthood, to watch it as much as he wants -- when he&#39;s mature of enough to take it -- not during his formative years.  And I feel the same way about &quot;The Passion of Christ.&quot;  I&#39;ve watched both films, but even as an adult, I still find the violence scary and too painful to watch or listen to (even though the latter, for me, was such a good film -- I didn&#39;t care too much for the former).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s funny is, he doesn&#39;t find those things (well, he hasn&#39;t watched graphic violence yet, of course) scary at all.  But when it comes to masks and scary music, it&#39;s a totally different story -- like when we happened to see a video clip of the old b & w &#39;20&#39;s film of the &quot;Phantom of the Opera.&quot;  This happened a few years ago when we attended a Young People&#39;s Concert at the Kennedy Center in DC.  The conductor wanted to prove how music provides mood and atmosphere by showing a clip of this film while the live orchestra played the scary music.  The clip showed the girl suddenly taking off the phantom&#39;s mask and revealing his scary, disfigured face underneath, while the music built up to the scary moment.  It freaked him out -- and many other kids as well in the theater!  For months after, someone always had to go with him upstairs or downstairs at home because he was too scared to go by himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe finally got over his fear after about a year.  Then we happened to watch the dvd of the &quot;King & I&quot; and same story -- he got scared of the bad guy (can&#39;t remember his name) who was wearing, what for him, was a scary mask while scary music (for him it was scary) was playing again.  It took quite a while for him to get over that, too, and he had to sleep with us in our room for months on the sleeping bag.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess, people have different fears.  Since I don&#39;t like violence, I think that my children will react the same way I do.  And 2 of them do -- my oldest dd and youngest ds.  But not ds 12 (the middle child).  He reacts to different things which don&#39;t really bother me.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould it be that the violence does not affect him as much because it&#39;s a male thing -- they love guns, war and weaponry and all -- and I&#39;m just needlessly worrying about it?  Still, I think that at certain ages, children can only take so much of the violence or harsh realities that have gone on and still go on in the world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that was the point I was trying to make.  Sorry to go off-tangent here by throwing in other things in this post.  But it&#39;s past 11 pm already, and I&#39;m rushing because my husband is waiting for me, wondering what the heck I&#39;m writing about.  If anyone can enlighten me about this issue -- ds&#39;s fear of masks & scary music and his total non-fear of violence in military history, I would greatly appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m off to bed now!<br/>\n<br/>\nShelley<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] reading about violence WAS Question about ds&#39;s intense interests","postDate":"1239409317","msgId":39431,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5REZFMkE1LjUwNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdyb2tjcytrMWVsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdyb2tjcytrMWVsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39429,"nextInTopic":39435,"prevInTime":39430,"nextInTime":39432,"topicId":39424,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Specifically, they don&#39;t go right to commentary and discussion as a way to process the hows and whys of topics like violence and cruelty - they read and watch and play games and think about all of that on their own. Talking about those issues is something that&#39;s more likely to start in the mid to late teens, but even at his age he&#39;s thinking about the deep issues behind all this military history, even if he doesn&#39;t have the skills to &quot;discuss&quot; the matter yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help you, in thinking about this, to peruse the &quot;young adult fiction&quot; section of a library or bookstore. There are Lots of books written for young teens with very heavy concepts embedded in them. Those subjects are no less powerful when written as fiction. If you are thinking the subject matter he&#39;s reading is more intense because its non-fiction, that&#39;s something to think about right there - why do assume that? If he were reading literature or fantasy, would you be as concerned?

But we want them to enjoy their childhood and youth because these are the foundation of adulthood.  And these periods are really such a short time compared to adulthood.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********************************<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t read that book, but I want to point out that most of &quot;the world&quot; doesn&#39;t give kids much of a choice in terms of what they can do or have or be. That steals more than childhood. You aren&#39;t throwing these books at your son and telling him he Has to read them - this is his interest. Don&#39;t take That away from him or devalue it. It may not look like innocence and wonder in the sense you imagine, but wonder comes in many forms. I just looked up innocence and found this as one definition: Freedom from guile, cunning, or deceit; simplicity or artlessness. Choosing to read about war for the fascination of it all is ultimately innocent in that sense. He&#39;s not learning it for any devious reason - unlike teaching children about war which almost always has underlying agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":346820406,"authorName":"hunnybunnies5@verizon.net","from":"&lt;hunnybunnies5@...&gt;","profile":"shelleydaez","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Question about ds&#39;s intense interests (For Robin B.)","postDate":"1239370955","msgId":39424,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFBNDZDQURBQTcyMjQ2RTM5MUY3NjhBNUNBN0EzODMwQHJvYnlQQz4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39429,"prevInTime":39423,"nextInTime":39425,"topicId":39424,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And he talks about how the world disrespects children and wants them to grow up right away, wants to deprive them of their innocence, their sense of wonder, in short, their childhood. But we want them to enjoy their childhood and youth because these are the foundation of adulthood.  And these periods are really such a short time compared to adulthood.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He&#39;ll move on when he&#39;s ready, if you give him opportunities. He can<br/>\n&gt; say yes or no &lt;g&gt;. Have you heard of strewing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strewing\">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but I will print out the article just to make sure I understand what it really means.  Thanks for the link.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think reminding him that he isn&#39;t trying new things, but ought to,<br/>\n&gt; could be keeping him stuck. It might feel like pressure to him, so<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s going to hold onto whatever he loves even more tightly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, you&#39;re right -- my poor baby!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My dd ate Dove Bars for breakfast for months and months. I could have<br/>\n&gt; said &quot;why don&#39;t you have this instead?&quot; or &quot;how about you try french<br/>\n&gt; toast? You know how you felt about Dove Bars before? It could be the<br/>\n&gt; same with french toast!&quot; That would have been me with an agenda. She<br/>\n&gt; would probably never have tried french toast if I approached it that<br/>\n&gt; way.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve described me exactly -- the agenda mom, unfortunately.  Still need to overcome this mindset.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Instead, I made sure we had Dove Bars until she was done enjoying<br/>\n&gt; them. I gave suggestions when I could tell she was beginning to move<br/>\n&gt; on. Now she likes raisin bran or bacon or eggs or chicken curry with<br/>\n&gt; naan, or pasta, or strawberries, or crepes, or whatever she feels<br/>\n&gt; like. Even french toast!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow!  So it&#39;s OK if we just let them be, if we just let them stick to one thing as long as they want and not try to help them *broaden their horizons*?  Because when I&#39;m enjoying something so much (like creme brulee&#39; or chocolate mousse or whatever), I just want to share the joy that I&#39;m experiencing with my kids.  Isn&#39;t that natural?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Right now, her favorite meal is cheddar & potato perogies. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; stocked lots, so she can have them. My husband&#39;s favorite breakfast is<br/>\n&gt; Multigrain Cheerios. I&#39;ve stocked lots, so he can have them. Then<br/>\n&gt; things will change. Or not. Dh has eaten Cheerios for breakfast since<br/>\n&gt; he was in elementary school. He does eat other things, but he prefers<br/>\n&gt; that particular cereal. It&#39;s okay. Really!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see what you mean -- it&#39;s all about respecting their choices and respecting who they are.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It comes down to acceptance of where your ds is *right now.* And you<br/>\n&gt; being open to change when he shows he&#39;s ready. It&#39;s definitely a shift<br/>\n&gt; in thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you, Robin, for taking the time to spell things out for me.  It&#39;s been really enlightening.  You are right -- in the end, acceptance is what matters most.  And when there is acceptance, there is peace in the family.  I plan to read more & more of those unschooling articles so that I can overthrow my old way of thinking and learn to be more accepting -- for my family&#39;s sake.<br/>\n<br/>\nGratefully,<br/>\n<br/>\nShelley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39434,"nextTopicId":39481}}
