For a couple of years we did a trade with","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1390741139\">Hi Jeanne-<br/>\n<br/>\nOur kids both take music lessons. We tried to find very relaxed teachers <br/>\nfor them at least to begin with. For a couple of years we did a trade <br/>\nwith an unschooling dad for bass lessons for my son. He is also a <br/>\nperforming musician and a very amazing man who was really great at <br/>\nhelping my son find interesting but not overwhelmingly difficult music <br/>\nand taught him a lot about music theory, spiritual aspects, playing in <br/>\ngroups, and  taking care of his body. This was affordable(just cost my <br/>\nhusband&#39;s time) and he was very understanding about ebbs and flows of <br/>\nwanting to play and take breaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter starting taking lessons this year we weren&#39;t quite as <br/>\nlucky, but I explained upfront, that she, not I, would be deciding about <br/>\nhow much to play and when before she started. So far it works. She plays <br/>\ndifferent amounts, when she chooses, and is enjoying the lessons, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it has been so hard to get involved appropriately. I want to <br/>\nsay things but stop myself. My son has recently switched teachers- we <br/>\nare now paying a lot for lessons and the teacher expects much more. He <br/>\nteaches college mainly, and would not want to invest time in my son if <br/>\nhe weren&#39;t doing the practicing. It is a couple of hours a day of <br/>\nscales, transcription, and playing pieces, very specific on technique <br/>\nand he is learning a lot here too, but it is such a different <br/>\nexperience. He is invited to attend some of the college classes and has <br/>\nbeen introduced to a whole new world. He also plays with an ensemble and <br/>\nother groups and so wants to be prepared for these as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n My son asks for help with remembering to practice.  He does tend to <br/>\nnaturally also, like your son, want to start playing late in the day <br/>\nwhen everyone else wants to sleep- our house is tiny, and  he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nreally want to play in the mud room or the garage. We&#39;d love to build <br/>\nhim a sound proof room and may do that soon.  It works to remind him <br/>\nafter dinner to begin playing or to help him plan out his practicing <br/>\nduring the day.  He really wants to improve, and really wants to please <br/>\nthis teacher, as he knows the teacher will not want to continue giving <br/>\nhim lessons if he weren&#39;t putting his all into it . This is our son&#39;s <br/>\nchoice, and he has difficulty with it at times. It is a lot of time, and <br/>\nhe likes a lot of other things as well. I am his partner in figuring out <br/>\nhow he uses his time, at his request. If he begins to seem annoyed with <br/>\nthe reminders I pull back. Then he usually will ask for help again soon. <br/>\nHe leaves me notes asking for reminders, and every day we discuss the <br/>\nplan for fitting all the fun things he wants to do in.<br/>\nHe is very enthusiastic about playing soccer and magic the gathering as <br/>\nwell, and makes lots of plans with friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has been hard is that often people are telling us how great he is <br/>\nand what potential he has, but we still know and must strive to remember <br/>\nalways  that it HAS to be about him. All these other people being <br/>\ninvolved and encouraging is necessary, as we don&#39;t have the ability to <br/>\nhelp him ourselves, but it is confusing at times to motivation. He likes <br/>\nperforming, and this is about pleasing other as well as yourself. <br/>\nSometimes he is confused, I think about why he is doing this, and needs <br/>\nto take a break to discover his own enjoyment of music again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to be very mindful through all this that is about my son, not <br/>\nabout any of these other people and their expectations and the nyssma <br/>\nscores and all that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the situation isn&#39;t the right one for your son, then trying to find <br/>\nanother one or taking a break might help. Both my kids have played <br/>\nwithout lessons for periods which was a very good thing also.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\nfinnymom wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m needing some guidance around Piano.
