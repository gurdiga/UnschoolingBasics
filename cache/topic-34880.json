She has a very different way about teaching and retaining students that really sets her apart from the rest.  She tends to retain students because the adults and children love her. She has stickability of her own. Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst,  because she individualizes each lesson to the student.  She uses a basic set of lesson books and then they get to pick all types of other music from rock to Disney themes, whatever they are into. And she individualizes the way she explains things to them. A funny example, one little girl got to have a big R and L on her hands written in lip liner pencil.  My mom didn&#39;t bat an eyelash that at 4 years old she hadn&#39;t learned Left and Right yet, she came up with a creative way to help the girl, who was tickled and happy about the big red letters on her hands.  A piano teacher from the old school might have taken a much harsher approach with the whole thing, instead she took a light hearted approach. One little boy was a huge Billy Joel fan and my mom got him tons of Easy Piano Billy Joel songs. (my piano/voice teacher only gave me songs from old-fashioned musicals... boring!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, her parents often moan about their kids not practicing. Most of them are very mainstream traditional types who don&#39;t really seem to get it unfortunately, and tie things like video game time to practice time.  She tells them don&#39;t &quot;send your kids in to practice a set time each day&quot; instead when the mood strikes both of you, go make music together.  Thats what its all about, music is emotion, happiness, celebration.  Take interest in the cool things the child has learned.  It should be a together family time.  Its a very unschooly way to look at it so its probably why they don&#39;t get it, but I think it sticks with some of them. If the kids come &quot;unprepared&quot; to the lesson, who cares?  They can play the songs some more at the lesson.  She&#39;s never punitive or cranky with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis whole family-centered and lighthearted approach to music study makes the kids want to play for themselves.  I recently read the older book Between Parent and Child by Haim Ginott *thanks for lending it Ginger! :) * and Dr. Ginott&#39;s chapter on music lessons is right on. He explains music is for expressing emotion.  Making it drill and rote is no way to foster the love of making music.  Read it, its good.<br/>\nPunitive and cranky piano teachers should be boycotted.  Don&#39;t stick yourselves to them.  If kids are interested in making music, find a good teacher (it might take a few tries) and take the right approach at home and kids can learn to play in the same unschooly way they learn math and history etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Sahara<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] &quot;Stickability&quot;","postDate":"1217362569","msgId":34911,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQUJGQ0YxMURCNTdFMy0xMDkwLUNGQFdFQk1BSUwtTUMxNC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJGREMxMEQ1NjNFNDQ3RTNCOUM1NzJFRUE0MERCNkZFQGRlbGw2Yzk5NzBhNDZjPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM4ZjE2ZSRmZjZjZGMwMCRmZTQ2OTQwMCRAY29tLmF1PiA8QkZEQzEwRDU2M0U0NDdFM0I5QzU3MkVFQTQwREI2RkVAZGVsbDZjOTk3MGE0NmM+"},"prevInTopic":34910,"nextInTopic":34912,"prevInTime":34910,"nextInTime":34912,"topicId":34880,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I learned to love when that happens - but it can<br/>\nbe a little bittersweet for the parent -- we can become vested in our<br/>\nkids&#39; activities and we can be disappointed in them when they don&#39;t<br/>\nachieve certain goals. When a kid doesn&#39;t want to continue something,<br/>\nwe often look at what they are NOT achieving rather than what they<br/>\nhave learned.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was very hard for me at first.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* had a hard time letting go of my son&#39;s passions.

Go figure! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t *like* to do the same thing day after day after week after <br/>\nmonth after year. I get tired of the same ol&#39; same ol&#39;.

He felt that I let her quit everything.  I look at her <br/>\nand am like ok at 15 she has been working for 3 or 4 years, she was <br/>\non a synchronized swimming team for 4 years, involved in girls Inc <br/>\nsince 3rd grade, taken weaving classes for 2 years, etc. what the <br/>\nhell are you talking about?   Yes she&#39;s tried a bunch of stuff and <br/>\nsome things she tried and didn&#39;t like, so what.   But his experience <br/>\nwas kids played team sports from 6 through High school and that&#39;s <br/>\nit.  Different experience, different expectations.  Too bad for him <br/>\nhe left her for me to raise and then doesn&#39;t understand that I <br/>\nraised her in my way.<br/>\n<br/>\n My understanding is that no one has to do what they don&#39;t want to <br/>\ndo as an adult.  You may FEEL like you have to but really  you <br/>\nCHOOSE to because either the reults are worth it or the consequences <br/>\naren&#39;t.   We don&#39;t learn this by being made to do things as <br/>\nchildren.  If you talk to or meet older unschoolers they can be <br/>\nincredibly focused.  It is by being allowed to make decisions and <br/>\nface the consequences that we learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLizzy just started piano lessons about a month ago.  She&#39;s been <br/>\nmessing around with a keyboard for a year and decided she needed <br/>\nsome guidance.  We found a teacher that was a home schooler so she <br/>\nis really cool about letting Liz go at her own pace.  She is really <br/>\nzooming through the concepts very quickly.  When I went to the piano <br/>\nstore to buy the books she needed the man told me I had to make her <br/>\npractice every day.  My thought is she can choose how much to put <br/>\ninto it.  I choose to pay for the lessons and drive her there.  If <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t want to go anymore she doesn&#39;t have to.    If she wants <br/>\nto improve she&#39;ll practice.  She&#39;s also very cyclical with her <br/>\ninterests.  She will imerse herself in something for hours for weeks <br/>\nand then not touch it for awhile.  That is just her learning <br/>\nstyle.   I trust her to let me know when she needs a break and she <br/>\ntrusts me to let her take one.  It works out fine for us.  <br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] &quot;Stickability&quot;","postDate":"1217347129","msgId":34899,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZCRjlBNjU5LUIxRkItNDY1My1COTVELTgyMjYzMUI0QjEyMEBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ4OEYxMTM4LjgwNTA5MDRAdHdjbnkucnIuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM4ZjE2ZSRmZjZjZGMwMCRmZTQ2OTQwMCRAY29tLmF1PiA8NDg4RjExMzguODA1MDkwNEB0d2NueS5yci5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34897,"nextInTopic":34904,"prevInTime":34898,"nextInTime":34900,"topicId":34880,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I know how to do it and I can -<br/>\nwhen inspiration hits - make amazing things but generally I hate doing it. I<br/>\nlove all the gadgets that help food cook themselves (except the microwave<br/>\nthat thing is evil!). I enjoy housework sound sick I know and my house isn&#39;t<br/>\nperfect because just like learning to cook or read. cleaning is not an<br/>\ninstinct.  I also enjoy reading. my first being mysteries. I have gone thru<br/>\nmany stages in my life horror, sci-fi, self-help, fantasy. but what if<br/>\nsomeone had told me that just because I read mysteries first I must always<br/>\nread mysteries?

We had the conversation yet again<br/>\nabout my 9yo daughter&#39;s issues with her piano lessons. <br/>\n<br/>\nBackground: my daughter likes piano and she had a great teacher and was very<br/>\nkeen, but then had to switch teachers and lost the enthusiasm for about six<br/>\nmonths, not practising at all.

I&#39;ve talked to them  <br/>\nabout how fun and satisfying it is to stick with something long enough  <br/>\nto really make a lot of progress and develop skills and proficiencies.  <br/>\nI would NEVER try to talk them into sticking with something they were  <br/>\nhating. But if it is something they&#39;ve really enjoyed and they seem to  <br/>\nme to still enjoy it, I might try to find a way to help them get  <br/>\nthrough the down time - but this is &quot;support&quot; - it is &quot;with&quot; them, not  <br/>\ncoercion. Like, I might say, &quot;Well, do you want to try only going to a  <br/>\nlesson every other week for a while?&quot; Or, &quot;Is there something special  <br/>\nyou&#39;d like to work on with your teacher instead of the regular  <br/>\nlessons?&quot; Or, &quot;How about taking a month off, just as a break, then  <br/>\ngoing back and seeing how it feels to you then?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, kids DO sometimes need support for sticking to  <br/>\nsomething. We have to judge how to support that in our child - each is  <br/>\ndifferent and each situation is also different.<br/>\n<br/>\nON the other hand, sometimes a kid is truly just DONE with an activity  <br/>\nand ready to give it up. We have to know when to accept that they have  <br/>\ngotten out of it what they needed/wanted and are truly ready to move  <br/>\non. It is so great to make it a &quot;moving on&quot; rather than a &quot;quitting&quot;  <br/>\nkind of experience. I learned to love when that happens - but it can  <br/>\nbe a little bittersweet for the parent -- we can become vested in our  <br/>\nkids&#39; activities and we can be disappointed in them when they don&#39;t  <br/>\nachieve certain goals. When a kid doesn&#39;t want to continue something,  <br/>\nwe often look at what they are NOT achieving rather than what they  <br/>\nhave learned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d tell your mom that you agree - learning to stick with something  <br/>\nwhen interest temporarily wanes is a good thing. And you&#39;ll be working  <br/>\nwith your daughter on ways to do that. And then add, &quot;Of course,  <br/>\nknowing when to stop doing something that isn&#39;t working for you  <br/>\nanymore is also an important skill.

My kids <br/>\nstick with all kinds of things that they want to stick to. My son is 15 <br/>\nand totally gets that sometimes he needs to do something less than ideal <br/>\nin order to get someplace he really wants to be. You should hear his <br/>\npractice sessions- he is quite focused on achieving! I don&#39;t know if he <br/>\nwill follow this path for his entire life- but right now many of his <br/>\nactions are focused on improving his bass playing as much as possible so <br/>\nthat he can become a well-known and well-paid performing musician.

I was told the same thing about learning responsibility, <br/>\naccountability, and blah blah blah.  What that really taught me <br/>\nthough is to not show an interest in anything because then I&#39;d be <br/>\nforced to do it.  It took me years and years to overcome that learned <br/>\nbehavior.  I was in my mid-30s when I felt ready to try something new <br/>\nbecause I knew I had the option to quit if I didn&#39;t like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes there are things I do that I don&#39;t necessarily like to do.  But I <br/>\ndo like the results of having done those things.  I don&#39;t like doing <br/>\nhousework but I love living in a somewhat tidy room.  So I choose to <br/>\nget through the yucky part to live in the nice result.  I can look at <br/>\nthings that way because I&#39;m more mature than I was when I was a <br/>\nchild.  I absolutely hated being told I needed to do things like a <br/>\ngrownup because one day I&#39;d be one.  The problem with that logic was <br/>\nthat I was being asked to be something I wasn&#39;t yet physically or <br/>\nemotionally capable of being.  The joy of adulthood was taken from me <br/>\nbefore I even reached it.  Again, it took years to find the joy in <br/>\nlife.  My mom and sister still don&#39;t get it and think I&#39;m wild and <br/>\nweird.  But I am happy and free and live a much more joyful life.  I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t go back to their way of living for anything in the world!<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":341368225,"authorName":"The Patersons","from":"&quot;The Patersons&quot; &lt;tuipiri@...&gt;","profile":"tuipiri","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"&quot;Stickability&quot;","postDate":"1217331241","msgId":34880,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM4ZjE2ZSRmZjZjZGMwMCRmZTQ2OTQwMCRAY29tLmF1Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":34884,"prevInTime":34879,"nextInTime":34881,"topicId":34880,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi.

I&#39;m after what wisdom you can give me!<br/>\n<br/>\nI just got off the phone with my mum. We had the conversation yet again<br/>\nabout my 9yo daughter&#39;s issues with her piano lessons. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBackground: my daughter likes piano and she had a great teacher and was very<br/>\nkeen, but then had to switch teachers and lost the enthusiasm for about six<br/>\nmonths, not practising at all. We&#39;re now back with the original teacher and<br/>\nshe seems happier to continue. I had a chat with her a while ago and asked<br/>\nher if she thought she wanted to continue and she said she wanted to be able<br/>\nto play when she grew up, so wanted to continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my mum has the very strong idea that you should be made to continue<br/>\nwith things you don&#39;t necessarily like because you might like them once you<br/>\nget better at them, and you might be very happy that you continued. How else<br/>\ndo you learn &quot;stickability&quot; she argues. &quot;After all, we all have to do things<br/>\nwe don&#39;t like in life, so you might as well learn how to do it as a child<br/>\notherwise you won&#39;t be able to achieve anything as an adult.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I know that there are so many flaws with that point of view, but I do<br/>\nhave flashes of doubt every so often, and I&#39;d really like someone else to<br/>\nspell out just how my children are going to have &#39;stickability&#39; in their<br/>\nlives... and examples?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nCecily<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34814,"nextTopicId":34943}}
