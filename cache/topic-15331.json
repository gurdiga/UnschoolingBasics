It hapened last thursday, and they said he&#39;d need surgury, now it&#39;s looking like he&#39;ll just need a cast, the dr&#39;s are a little confused by the ammount of healing done in so short a time, sooo maybe we&#39;ll still be able to swing the confrence, I hope so. :)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I don&#39;t go biking with him much, I moved from a beach cruiser with back brakes to a 26 speed hybrid mountain bike over night and got intimidated, I think I need to down grade. lol<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ~~~As to the group thing.<br/>\nI&#39;ve found (in the 10 years we&#39;ve homeschooled) that groups tend to<br/>\nget more quiet in the summer.
