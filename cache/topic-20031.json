My current thoughts about<br/>\nunschooling and parenting my children with more freedom and choices are<br/>\nthoughts I wish I had always exhibited.  I know for now this is &quot;the<br/>\nreal me&quot;, and &quot;coming into my own&quot;, as it felt like coming HOME when the<br/>\nlight came on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are still youngish and they are very forgiving, thank<br/>\nGoodness.  It&#39;s nice to get a second chance... but the thought that at<br/>\ntimes I&#39;d be harsh and hard on them for things that really were not<br/>\nworth all that, It makes me shudder to think I used to BE like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m the kind of person who, when I change, I don&#39;t do &quot;baby steps&quot; I<br/>\njump into it with my whole heart and soul, because I either believe in<br/>\nsomething or I don&#39;t.  The children are getting used to the &quot;new me&quot;,<br/>\nand embracing our life together with love.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot change the past.  My children know, due to me being honest with<br/>\nthem (I showed my oldest daughter &quot;Parenting from the Heart&quot; by Jan<br/>\nHunt), that I wish I had been that way with them from day one.  Being<br/>\nhonest with your children, letting them know that just because you&#39;re a<br/>\ngrown-up chronologically doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no room for change, that&#39;s<br/>\nbeen a big one for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey know I am disgusted by my past attitudes and reactions towards<br/>\nthem.  I&#39;ve divorced myself from the person I used to be, and my<br/>\nchildren are truly the blessing in my life they were from the beginning,<br/>\nbut I didn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;.  Now, I am moving onward.

Well....mostly.<br/>\n  And going along with doing a good job.....Khalid left the house in his pajamas today.  A definite no-no in my mom&#39;s book of good mommyhood - LOL.
