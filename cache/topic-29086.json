I was introduced to unschooling a couple of years ago from a friend that does (and I must say has a great relationship with her 14 year old).  Anyway, I stayed plugged into to ps system (pre-school and 1/2 year of kindergarten) for a while.  This January 10th (I think)  I took the full plunge into unschooling!! And I will say that it is challenging to stop alllllll the bad habits  -- sending to room, spanking (eeek), yelling... etc.  But I truly think making the commitment and sticking to it is worth it.   That last few weeks I&#39;ve been on reading, posting and sucking all the info I can about  deschooling and unschooling.   Maybe  sometimes too much since it has taken away from paying closer attention to my boys -- but I have needed the extra knowledge and support to know that everything is going to be just fine.  About the third week into it now I feel that I can do<br/>\n this  and fears are diminishing (and my mother is even easing up-- she was very negative when I first took Ian out&gt;&gt; oh well her problem) .    Anyway, just thought I let you know that I can relate to you and many more on this list also.   Sometimes statements from some will feel very direct but I personally feel we need this to get us over the  hump  --- Most of these folks have been right where we are standing. <br/>\n  Also keep visualizing the peaceful home and it will be so.....<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                         <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n </span></blockquote>---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
