(Been doing it for years)<br/>\nShe gets more stressed over being graded.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has some desire to DDR, likes myspace, likes to make music<br/>\n(which I have been trying to encourage), likes acting as long as <br/>\nit&#39;s on her terms, <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no public transportation, only 100,000 acres of woods.<br/>\nThey pay me to drive my kids to the nearest bus stop as even <br/>\nthe public school won&#39;t come out here. (not kidding.  I lose $200.<br/>\na month by not sending my son to ps. Weird, huh)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would gladly take her to extra cirriculars but my spouse says<br/>\nif she gets pulled, he won&#39;t allow it.  I put her in dance with my daughter<br/>\nwhen they were little and they both really enjoyed it.  My step-daughter&#39;s<br/>\nmom stopped that!  Even if I pay and drive, she refused her daughter<br/>\neverything she has wanted to try.  When it was our part of the summer,<br/>\nI let her try as much as I could.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he pulls her, I plan on taking her for music lessons I know she wants.<br/>\nI figure I&#39;ll schedule them during the day when her mom&#39;s working, on<br/>\na variable schedule, so I can take her when Dad&#39;s working, too.<br/>\n(loop holes?  Worth the fight.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey pulled her computer time, cell phone, and completely grounded her<br/>\nthis semester, until she pulled her grades up to a 2.0, but she didn&#39;t care<br/>\nand continues to fail.   She knows her father plans to remove her if she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nstart doing her school work but even that seems to mean nothing.<br/>\nI told my spouse not to worry so much about the <br/>\ngrades as she is far more educated at 14 then many out there.<br/>\nIf and when she wants to learn, she will.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never have raised her as these two do.<br/>\nShe has tended to  be a chunky child, but this year she has been slimming up.<br/>\nShe wants to look good.  That pretty much sums it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the ideas of things to ask.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Michelle Leifur Reid &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamperedmichelle@...\">pamperedmichelle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 29, 2006 6:48:48 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Need advice again<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 11/29/06, Vicki &lt;vickisue_gray@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m worried that if my spouse pulls her from her friends, he risks<br/>\n&gt; losing his daughter in the long run and he&#39;ll create a very bad home<br/>\n&gt; envirnoment for everyone else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does she want to do?

So I want to ask your advice on unschooling a reluctate<br/>\nteenager.  I think I posted something about this in the past but as <br/>\nthe time draws near, figure I better prepare.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy step-daughter has no desire beyond flirting with boys.

My spouse wants to &quot;homeschool&quot; her and <br/>\nremove her from the only thing she cares about.  Her social life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI warned him, that she has never had a desire to do school work, and <br/>\nby pulling her away from her friends, is going to create a living hell <br/>\nat home.  We live in the middle of nowhere, really, so there&#39;s no kids <br/>\nin the neighborhood, no stores to walk to, no one to hitch a ride from <br/>\nexcept me, dad or her older step-sister.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe showed a musical interest so I got her a piano, and a harp she <br/>\nwanted, but her mother refused to let her go to lessons even if I or <br/>\ngrandma paid.  (I feel so bad for this child)  With her homeschooling, <br/>\nI can get her to music lessons without involving her mom or dad, but I <br/>\nsee a very bad situation for my son and I, who have been enjoying <br/>\nunschooling.  He&#39;s nine and is really enjoying life.  He would love <br/>\nfor his half-sister to be home with him, but I am worried that she&#39;ll <br/>\ntake out her anger on him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, personally, have had issues coming to grip with all that has <br/>\nhappened this past year.  I work full-time 4-12pm Sun-Thurs. A must to <br/>\nhelp pay the bills.  My daughter, 16 yo, watches grandma and the nine <br/>\nyo when dad&#39;s and my schedules cross.  He&#39;s a firefighter, so on shift <br/>\nevery third day.  This breaks down to her heating dinner around 6-7 <br/>\ndays a month.  Grandma had a stroke last winter, so she is learning to <br/>\nget around, but her mind is slipping a little.  It&#39;s sort of like <br/>\nhaving an eight year old added to the mix.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease excuse the half, step, etc...I just put them in to give a truer <br/>\npicture of the relationships of the parties involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m worried that if my spouse pulls her from her friends, he risks <br/>\nlosing his daughter in the long run and he&#39;ll create a very bad home <br/>\nenvirnoment for everyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts and insights would be appreciated.
