Her husband is reluctant----in more ways than one. Ben wrote <br/>\nto  encourage her to bring the whole family. I thought some of you might be  <br/>\ninterested in reading a dad&#39;s viewpoint. I&#39;ve deleted her questions and some  <br/>\nspecifics, but I think you&#39;ll get the gist.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m lucky.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\n*************************<br/>\n <br/>\nAt least 10 dads (not to mention countless moms and kids) have had  <br/>\nlife-changing experiences at the past two conferences.  I can&#39;t pinpoint a  specific <br/>\nevent which made those things happen, so I must attribute it to the  entire <br/>\nconference.  The presenters ... the funshops ... the dads&#39;  get-together ... <br/>\nchildren experiencing some of their own ... the talent show ...  everything that <br/>\nthe conference offers (and leaves out) is important.   Complete submersion into <br/>\nthe entire conference will help more than just picking  and choosing certain <br/>\nthings to see and hear.  You can&#39;t submerge or pick  and choose if one of you <br/>\nis not there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m assuming that you mean my talk with the fathers  when you say &#39;your <br/>\ntalk&quot;; I actually am presenting in the main tent on &quot;Rules vs  Principles&quot;, also.  <br/>\nFor the sake of this e-mail, I&#39;ll go with my  assumption.  My get-together <br/>\nwith the fathers will give him some insight  into unschooling and ways that <br/>\nothers experience it in and outside of their  homes.  Unschooling is not the <br/>\nproduct of an equation; there is no one  definition or way to do it.  It is the math <br/>\nequivalent of  infinity because it is continuous and evolving and maleable <br/>\nand has no defined  stopping point.  It must be lived and experienced correctly, <br/>\nand it extends  the journey of learning.  As far as &#39;graduation&#39; and college <br/>\nare concerned,  there should be people there with whom he can speak about <br/>\nthose subjects (in  fact, one of the speakers, Valerie Fitzenrieter, will be <br/>\ntalking about  her daughter, Laurie, who just began working on her  <br/>\ndoctorate---unschooled until college).  As far as successful goes, you&#39;re  treading on thin <br/>\nice with me.  My DW never graduated from college, and  she&#39;s been successful <br/>\nfrom society&#39;s and unschooling&#39;s standpoint.   Maybe you both need to define the <br/>\nmeaning of being &quot;successful&quot;.  Bill  Gates would take exception to needing a <br/>\ncollege degree to be &quot;successful&quot;.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour can&#39;t support or understand what he hasn&#39;t  experienced or read about.  <br/>\nHaving him there at the very least means  exposure; besides, he&#39;s agreed to <br/>\ncome already.  But if you think he&#39;ll  make it miserable for your son, you need <br/>\nto ask whether or not you will continue  to unschool if your husband is not <br/>\nsupportive.  My get-together with  the fathers is crucial to his being in a <br/>\n&#39;safe&#39; environment to discuss issues  specific to the dads.  Everything else at <br/>\nthe conference is just as  important because he&#39;ll see how fathers are <br/>\ninteracting with their children  every minute of every hour of every day of the <br/>\nconference.  Not knocking  you moms, but that is a thing of beauty for me.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is more of a separate subject than the conference itself, but two  <br/>\nthings here: 1) what &#39;you&#39; want vs what he wants and 2) teaching vs  learning.  <br/>\nWhat he wants is what your focus is in unschooling.  One of  the basic themes <br/>\nthroughout your note is how much you want this to work, and  that&#39;s good ... you <br/>\nhave to have the passion to do it.  But in the end,  it&#39;s got to be what he <br/>\nwants.  I don&#39;t deny that being home in an  unschooling environment would be the <br/>\nbest thing for him, but he&#39;s gotta be the  one to make that choice.  His <br/>\nchoice will be to stay home if he realizes  that you will help him learn <br/>\nabsolutely anything that he&#39;s interested in.   If that means watching TV, playing video <br/>\ngames, playing cards, or coloring in a  coloring book all day for the next <br/>\ntwo months, let him do it.  He&#39;ll be  &#39;deschooling&#39;, gaining confidence in <br/>\nhimself (and you), become more responsible  for his own learning, and experience <br/>\nthe value of self-led learning.  Your  responsibility is not to teach, but to <br/>\nfind ways to turn your &quot;no&#39;s&quot; into  &quot;yes&#39;s&quot;.  In his time, his responsibility <br/>\nwill be to make choices based  upon his passions and interests and not upon what <br/>\nsome faceless administration,  government official, or other self-appointed <br/>\nexpert thinks he should be  doing.  He will empower himself.<br/>\n <br/>\n************************<br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s more----but I just thought I&#39;d share a bit.<br/>\n <br/>\n~K<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2769,"nextTopicId":2757}}
