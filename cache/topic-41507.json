Printing out selected articles from<br/>\n  Sandra Dodd&#39;s collection of writings on her website (it&#39;s not just her<br/>\n  writings - she&#39;s spent the last decade or more collecting helpful,<br/>\n  insightful articles and snippets from lots of people). There a links<br/>\n  there to other people&#39;s sites as well so it makes a nice central<br/>\n  starting point to finding short articles that you can read online or<br/>\n  print out to read later.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A good practice might be when you (or your DH) are &quot;channeling&quot; your<br/>\n  parents, before you say or do anything, stop and think &quot;Why?&quot; just one<br/>\n  short word. &quot;Why am I about to say this?&quot; &quot;Why am I about to do this?&quot;<br/>\n  &quot;Why do I believe this is important?&quot; If there&#39;s not a good answer<br/>\n  besides &quot;That&#39;s the way I&#39;ve always done it, that&#39;s how mom and dad did<br/>\n  it&quot; then stop and think more. If it&#39;s along the lines of safety, for<br/>\n  example, then move forward &quot;why am I about to do this? Because I&#39;m<br/>\n  concerned that someone will get hurt.&quot; Okay, then you move to &quot;Is there<br/>\n  another way to give the kids the same type of thing if this thing is too<br/>\n  dangerous?&quot; or, to make it shorter &quot;How can I change (my thoughts, the<br/>\n  situation, etc) so that I can say Yes?&quot; Don&#39;t be afraid to apologize if<br/>\n  something jumps out of your mouth and then you go &quot;Doh! That was silly!&quot;<br/>\n  Mainstream thought is that parents have to be consistent, so if you say<br/>\n  No it has to stay NO, or if you impose a punishment you have to follow<br/>\n  through - even IF you realize two seconds later that it&#39;s pretty stupid<br/>\n  to do so. That&#39;s just nonsense (to be a bit blunt). You are allowed to<br/>\n  change your mind and even APOLOGIZE to your kids for saying or doing<br/>\n  something hurtful. Another tactic that some find useful is to pause and<br/>\n  think &quot;Would I say/do this to my spouse/best friend?&quot; If not, don&#39;t do<br/>\n  it to your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Deb R<br/>\n<br/>\n  **********************************************************************<br/>\n  This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\n  intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\n  are addressed.

He has noticed I have changed my parenting - being more as you have all been speaking about putting the needs and relationship before the commands and demands type thing, and he has wanted to change more himself - he says he gets and agrees with the concept, however his father is somewhat ingrained in his mind - like alot of us. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anything you would recommend I get him to read that will help without being to long.

Printing out selected articles from<br/>\nSandra Dodd&#39;s collection of writings on her website (it&#39;s not just her<br/>\nwritings - she&#39;s spent the last decade or more collecting helpful,<br/>\ninsightful articles and snippets from lots of people). There a links<br/>\nthere to other people&#39;s sites as well so it makes a nice central<br/>\nstarting point to finding short articles that you can read online or<br/>\nprint out to read later.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good practice might be when you (or your DH) are &quot;channeling&quot; your<br/>\nparents, before you say or do anything, stop and think &quot;Why?&quot; just one<br/>\nshort word. &quot;Why am I about to say this?&quot; &quot;Why am I about to do this?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Why do I believe this is important?&quot; If there&#39;s not a good answer<br/>\nbesides &quot;That&#39;s the way I&#39;ve always done it, that&#39;s how mom and dad did<br/>\nit&quot; then stop and think more. If it&#39;s along the lines of safety, for<br/>\nexample, then move forward &quot;why am I about to do this? Because I&#39;m<br/>\nconcerned that someone will get hurt.&quot; Okay, then you move to &quot;Is there<br/>\nanother way to give the kids the same type of thing if this thing is too<br/>\ndangerous?&quot; or, to make it shorter &quot;How can I change (my thoughts, the<br/>\nsituation, etc) so that I can say Yes?&quot; Don&#39;t be afraid to apologize if<br/>\nsomething jumps out of your mouth and then you go &quot;Doh! That was silly!&quot;<br/>\nMainstream thought is that parents have to be consistent, so if you say<br/>\nNo it has to stay NO, or if you impose a punishment you have to follow<br/>\nthrough - even IF you realize two seconds later that it&#39;s pretty stupid<br/>\nto do so. That&#39;s just nonsense (to be a bit blunt). You are allowed to<br/>\nchange your mind and even APOLOGIZE to your kids for saying or doing<br/>\nsomething hurtful. Another tactic that some find useful is to pause and<br/>\nthink &quot;Would I say/do this to my spouse/best friend?&quot; If not, don&#39;t do<br/>\nit to your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
