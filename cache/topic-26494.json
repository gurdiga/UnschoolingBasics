Well i can easily get into guilt for making them feel unsafe through my actions.<br/>\nthe next step up is Rage: And here I could have a real feast of venting my Rage at their insensitivity, and assumptions and how dare they say that they won&#39;t forgive me for what I unintentionally did to them. Stron Word! Our unschooling has NOTHING to do with them! And so on . I would really stay at this point a while to get it out of my system.<br/>\nMaybe I would alsready get into Blame at this stage, which feels even better to me.<br/>\nThen I would look for thoughts to think about this whole thing that feel even a little bit better like Disappointment or frustration. <br/>\nAnd so on. Until I felt bored about it or even hopeful that eventually they will also see the light. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Another tack I would use is putting them into the peanut gallery compartment., by saying, &quot;What they think of me and what I do is not my business.&quot; And likewise, &quot;What I do is not their business. Basta!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I could also find all the wonderful positive aspects of my new unschooling life and make a lsit of them and really give each lots of appreciative thoughts until whatever anybody else said about it they would not be able to touch me anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) And lastly I would take this letter and put it away to forget about it, try to forgive my parents for not knwoing it better and turn to my own little family and appreciate them and their willingness to live an unschooling life with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlissings<br/>\nUlrike<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94040812,"authorName":"Lisa Heyman","from":"&quot;Lisa Heyman&quot; &lt;Lmanathome@...&gt;","profile":"lmanathome","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: mom in law&#39;s letter about the homeschooling issue","postDate":"1190820373","msgId":26510,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTExNS1EQVYyMDkyMjNDQjg5QjAwMzQ3RDczNkVFRDFCMDBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":26509,"nextInTopic":26511,"prevInTime":26509,"nextInTime":26511,"topicId":26494,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sara - we have a monthly gathering of unschooling families that meet in the lower Hudson valley area.

That&#39;s quite a letter.  I can only imagine how difficult it is to maintain any kind of relationship with someone who has such a strong need to control and manipulate others, even her adult children.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Personally, that&#39;s one grandparent I&#39;d write off -- the whole tone of her letter is toxic. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I went into parenthood hoping my kids could have grandparents - especially grandfathers since dh & I never really knew ours -- but have had to realize the g&#39;parents need to be curtailed and *managed* to some extent.  My Mom has no contact with us -- her choice; my Dad has contact on my terms, and we&#39;ve never discussed unschooling, tho he does know we *homeschool* and is okay with that (I&#39;m sure he has his own ideas about what the word means and I have no desire to explain it to him). <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Dh&#39;s parents, tho, do desire a closer relationship with us and our kids. They don&#39;t understand our choice to homeschool (and we&#39;ve not yet discussed unschooling with them) or dh&#39;s choice to drive a truck, or mine to be home with kids when I could have a *real* job, or our choice to leave DC and move to New Mexico, or really any of the lifestyle we&#39;ve chosen.  But, we&#39;re hoping to have the unschooling dialogue with them soon. They just returned home from a weeklong visit with us, so the email missive -- yanno, the one detailing all their *concerns* and *dismay* about the boys -- is sure to arrive soon. Dh promises that this time we&#39;ll throw out the unschooling info and talk it all out with them.  He has some vague hope we can all agree to disagree; dear Andy has some innocent hope that once we *tell the truth* the grandparents will be okay with unschooling.  I tend to think they&#39;re both naive and that there&#39;s just no way we can sell unschooling to those people.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Then again, I come from an Irish family of screamers who quickly escalate to *these are my f&#39;ing kids and if you want to see them, you&#39;ll do it on my terms.*   Hey, it worked with both my parents -- he shut up, and she dropped out.  But, not really a tactic I&#39;m able to use with the inlaws.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBuilding a website is a piece of cake. <br/>\nYahoo!
