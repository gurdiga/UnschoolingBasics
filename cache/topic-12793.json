Oh, and the <br/>\nkids like  it, too!  :) <br/>\nLeslie in SC  (I found more info on snopes at <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.snopes.com/autos/business/hondacog.asp_\">http://www.snopes.com/autos/business/hondacog.asp_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.snopes.com/autos/business/hondacog.asp)\">http://www.snopes.com/autos/business/hondacog.asp)</a> ) <br/>\n******* <br/>\nBackground  on Honda commercial: <br/>\n“And you thought  those people who set up rooms full of dominos to knock over <br/>\nwere amazing...There  are no computer graphics or digital tricks in the film. <br/>\nEverything you see  really happened in real time exactly as you see it. <br/>\nThe film took 606  takes. On the first 605 takes, something, usually minor, <br/>\ndidn&#39;t work. They would  then have to set the whole thing up again. The crew <br/>\nspent weeks shooting night  and day. By the time it was over, they were ready to <br/>\nchange professions. The  film cost six million dollars and took three months <br/>\nto complete including full  engineering of the sequence. In addition, it&#39;s two <br/>\nminutes long so every time  Honda airs the film on British television, <br/>\nthey&#39;re shelling out enough dough to  keep any one of us in clover for a lifetime. <br/>\nHowever, it is fast  becoming the most downloaded  advertisement in Internet <br/>\nhistory. Honda  executives figure the ad will soon pay for itself simply in <br/>\n&quot;free viewings&quot;  (Honda isn&#39;t paying a dime to have you watch this commercial!). <br/>\nWhen the ad was  pitched to senior executives, they signed off on it <br/>\nimmediately without any  hesitation - including the costs. <br/>\nThere are six and  only six hand-made Honda Accords in the world. To the <br/>\nhorror of Honda engineers,  the filmmakers disassembled two of them to make the <br/>\nfilm. Everything you see in  the film (aside from the walls, floor, ramp, and  <br/>\ncomplete Honda Accord) is  parts from those two cars. The voiceover is Garrison <br/>\nKeillor. When the ad was  shown to Honda executives, they liked it and <br/>\ncommented on how amazing computer  graphics have gotten.  They fell off their chairs <br/>\nwhen they found out it  was for real.  Oh. and about those funky windshield <br/>\nwipers.  On  the new Accords, the windshield wipers have water sensors and are <br/>\ndesigned  to start doing their thing automatically as soon as they become  <br/>\nwet. It  looks a bit weird in the commercial.” <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/honda.php_\">http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/honda.php_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/honda.php)\">http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/honda.php)</a>    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12798,"nextTopicId":12799}}
