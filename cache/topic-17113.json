I&#39;m positive that  <br/>\nthere is some creative way out there  for your sleep.

She knew that we had  <br/>\ngotten money recently and when I said, we can&#39;t buy it now, we have  <br/>\nto wait a week, she didn&#39;t understand. Normally I would have just  <br/>\nsaid &quot;no&quot; and not explained anything. But  recently she discovered my  <br/>\ncalculator and has been playing around with it and having fun. So  <br/>\n(now that we are unschooling and I&#39;m explaining the real nos) I took  <br/>\nit and showed her how much income we have (we have a detailed list),  <br/>\nand how much we have to spend, and when we get all that money and  <br/>\nwhen we have to spend it. For her it was really &quot;Aha&quot; and she really  <br/>\napreciated that I took the time and explained all of that and she  <br/>\naccepted the no, because of truely understanding the conditions,  <br/>\nwhich is only fair.  I mean REALLY talking, explaining everything,  <br/>\nnot just half of the truth, but also why you chose to work at nights  <br/>\n(to be able to be with them during the day â (ask yourself: is the  <br/>\nreason why you are doing this really happening or are you rather only  <br/>\nsleeping during the days? Maybe it would be easier then for them if  <br/>\nyou jsut worked during the day and they wouldn&#39;t have you at all -  <br/>\nbut this is just a side note and not trying to tell you to quit the  <br/>\njob. Just in case the outcome is the same as if you just worked  <br/>\nduring the day, you might better just do that then!)). Why you need  <br/>\nto do so (money, and why, how much is really needed and so on), why  <br/>\nyour husband cannot stay at home (more income maybe or whatever the  <br/>\nreason) and so on... If your 11 yr old understands better than your 6  <br/>\nyr old, he might want to help you out with this problem. Maybe both  <br/>\nunderstand very well! Maybe your son would agree Babysitting for a  <br/>\nwhile or so? And since the question about giving your children money  <br/>\narised here recently and I read that some unschoolers let their kids  <br/>\ndo some jobs for money â maybe you like the idea of having your son  <br/>\ndo this (although I don&#39;t really like that idea... well I dunno yet,  <br/>\nI haven&#39;t thought about it thoughtfully yet), but just in case you  <br/>\nhave been thinking of hiring a babysitter, maybe his brother would be  <br/>\nbetter and you are still available anyway in case of emergency.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is.. maybe you can move the TV somewhere else, so you  <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to let them watch in your bedroom â or you could sleep  <br/>\nsomewhere else? Guest room? mother&#39;s room? kids room? So at least  <br/>\nthis part :<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;hell, it&#39;s not like I am SLEEPING up there, right?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nof your annoyment would vanish :-) So at least, if at some point they  <br/>\nreally choose to watch TV while you sleep, you wont get interrupted  <br/>\nby the TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nHm what else... maybe they need more input on what they could really  <br/>\ndo with that time! Maybe you could collect things during the week  <br/>\nwhich could be interesting (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strewing\">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a> & http:// <br/>\nsandradodd.com/BoredNoMore) and hand them out on these days, so there  <br/>\nis something fun and new to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it would work if they could at least be with you, even if you  <br/>\nsleep, so it would be get the TV, the console, the games the books  <br/>\nthe magazines and the toys TO your bedroom, ... or get yourself to  <br/>\nthe kids room and you are there, but sleeping, and they are with you?  <br/>\nWhen my daughter was younger, i found that it really helped to at  <br/>\nleast doze while she was playing. But I could be still be right there  <br/>\nif she needed me. Maybe they would even be respectful and quiet while  <br/>\nyou sleep and maybe that would be boring after a while anyway and  <br/>\nthey could go somewhere else. And maybe, just as with every limits  <br/>\nyou set â the more there is limited mom, the more they want her. So  <br/>\nmaybe being available somehow although you sleep would help. This  <br/>\nwould require you not to yell and be angry though, or else it is not  <br/>\nreally a choice. Advice about hot not to yell and be angry gives  <br/>\nScott Noelle again :-D I found his texts very helpful at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea is maybe not to go to sleep at a special bedtime on  <br/>\nthese three days, but to go to bed when you feel they are into  <br/>\nsomething now (maybe you already do this!). Like when people tell  <br/>\nyoung parents to sleep when their baby is asleep (instead of trying  <br/>\nto condition the baby to sleep when the *parent* needs to sleep). So  <br/>\nyou are there for them *first* and as soon as you see they are hooked  <br/>\nup into something and won&#39;t need you for a while, you can say what  <br/>\nyou are going to do now &quot;I want to sleep now â if anyone wants to  <br/>\nsleep with me, feel free to join&quot;, that sounds better then putting an  <br/>\nexpectation in it: &quot;I really need to sleep now, so just DON&#39;T wake me  <br/>\nup, OK?&quot; That already tells your children you are expecting them to  <br/>\nwake you up anyway. And check out what Scott says about &quot;needing&quot;  <br/>\nsomething, I found it interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and I remember on some homepage of unschooling parents I read that  <br/>\nsometimes they would plan the day in the morning so that everybody  <br/>\ncould get things done. i tried that here and it was good especially  <br/>\nwhen I was planning to get my needs met as well. So everyone has to  <br/>\nsay what he wants to do, and then you&#39;ll try to schedule it a bit, so  <br/>\nthat it fits best. So 6yerold wants to go to the museum, watch Movie  <br/>\nX, read book Y and eat cookies and 11yr bring the books back to the  <br/>\nlibrary, also watch Movie X now that you mentioned it, play game Y  <br/>\nand chek emails, you want to  get the laundry done, read your  <br/>\nnewspaper, call XY and sleep. So you can then try to schedule it  <br/>\nlike: First we&#39;ll go to the museum and on the way home we can go to  <br/>\nthe library and deliver the books, we can buy something cookies, go  <br/>\nhome, while you read book Y with 6yr old, 11yr could play game Y and  <br/>\nwhen they watch the movie together you could sleep meanwhile. So  <br/>\neverybodies wishes is respected and they know from the beginning that  <br/>\na) their needs will be respected even though you want to sleep b) you  <br/>\nwill want to sleep sometime c) what to do while you sleep. I guess  <br/>\nschedules are not really &quot;unschooling&quot;, but if you keep it flexible  <br/>\nand don&#39;t force them to do the things they had planned until they  <br/>\nchanged their minds... it could work :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd also, don&#39;t think that in &quot;normal&quot; schooled families, the parents  <br/>\nare never frustrated like you are now :-) I often cried because it  <br/>\n&quot;didn&#39;t work&quot; in this or the other way. So this should not be the  <br/>\nreason why you stop unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/%7Efetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/%7Efetteroll/rejoycing/</a> <br/>\ncommitments%20obligation%20responsi/haveto.html may be applied to  <br/>\nyour problem as well..

Kids have meltdowns when they are too <br/>\ntired and so do adults. It is important for you to work out a sleep schedule <br/>\nand still be available to your children. Maybe you could sit down with the <br/>\nkids (when you&#39;re not angry or tired) and ask for their help in coming up <br/>\nwith ideas so that you can get some sleep and still be there for them. Maybe <br/>\nworking together on a schedule or having a system of some sort (that THEY <br/>\nare involved in creating) so that they can respect your needs and still get <br/>\nwhat they need from you (and it really sounds like the kids all need you <br/>\nmore than they are getting right now). They might surprise you with the <br/>\nideas they have and with how well they respect the plan they come up with.<br/>\n<br/>\n**There was a discussion a while back (I think it was on this forum) about a <br/>\ndifficult father at home all the time when the mom was trying to unschool <br/>\nand the kids and mom had to walk on eggshells all day or get yelled at, he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like their behavior and really didn&#39;t sound like his relationship was <br/>\nvery strong with anyone in the home. Some people thought that school would <br/>\nbe a better environment for these kids than the alternative in their home. <br/>\nI&#39;m not in your home so I&#39;m not sure other than from these posts but it <br/>\nsounds like there is hardly any REAL interaction between you and the kids <br/>\nwhen you are trying to get your sleep. I wonder how you might have handled <br/>\nall this in your past &quot;traditional&quot; ways. Are you saying that you would <br/>\nusually just tell them to not wake you unless the house was on fire and <br/>\nleave them to themselves? How much do you think THEY got out of these old <br/>\ninteractions? How much did YOU get out of these interactions? They might get <br/>\nmore out of being in a school of some sort if the alternative is to be at <br/>\nhome with only their siblings and no real quality time with a parent to help <br/>\nthem throughout their day. This is one of the reasons why I&#39;m not so keen on <br/>\na Sudbury type school since there is no constant parental availability and <br/>\nopportunity for interaction. Again, I&#39;m not in your home to tell for sure <br/>\n(you know best), but are these days when you are recovering from work really <br/>\nenriching your relationship with your kids?<br/>\n<br/>\n**Finally, I don&#39;t know that anyone here on the list will have an ultimate <br/>\nsolution that&#39;s right for you. I do think that many people will offer up <br/>\nsome questions that you might want to ask yourself (if you haven&#39;t already). <br/>\nMaybe there will be a few little suggestions here and there but I think you <br/>\nalready know that to make it work you&#39;re going to probably need to make some <br/>\nchanges (either in work schedule, sleep schedule, etc.).

It has worked for years but has just lately started to get harder. Mostly because I am trying to do things right.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I try doing things right, try considering everyone&#39;s needs, try finding solutions everyone can enjoy...I just end up feeling a thousand times worse when I inevitably fail. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday:<br/>\n6.5 year old comes upstairs to wake me to tell me that 11.5 year old will not play Sonic Heroes with him.<br/>\nI have a brief interlude with him in which I attempt to explore the depth of his commitment to play said game. I come to the conclusion after talking to him for a few minutes that the reason he wants to play Sonic Heroes with his big brother is simply because his big brother does NOT want to...but I was willing to admit I could be projecting a bit...although he and I did talk about that and he (the 6.5 yr old) did agree that that was probably true.<br/>\nI come downstairs to discover that a totally different game is in the console. That said game is in console and paused because big brother had gone to the bathroom after getting little brother through a hard part  in this other game at his request. <br/>\nI sit on the floor with everyone. I talk about finding answers we are all happy with. I probe to see what everyone wants. I go to the bathroom and come back and they are playing checkers. Great!<br/>\nNo. They play checkers and I referee. 6.5 year old is learning about rules. Ok. 6.5 year old gets bored. Game over.<br/>\nOkay. Now what does everyone want? Oh they start picking or something at each other and I lose it. I yell extremely loudly about trying to do the RIGHT THING here and couldn&#39;t they at least TRY to help me do that? <br/>\nThey stop bickering and stare in shame.<br/>\nI lose track of events because now I am inwardly wallowing in remorse and shame.My favorite pass-time.<br/>\nI ask again what anyone would like to do. Watch TV? Okay, big kid wants to watch TV so I send him up into my bedroom to watch TV--hell, it&#39;s not like I am SLEEPING up there, right?<br/>\nHE starts crying. Why? I don&#39;t get it? Because I am yelling? I mean it, you really can go upstairs and watch TV and I really am trying not to yell and I am sorry.<br/>\nLittle brother has no idea what to do now. <br/>\nPlay Sonic. NO, play the one we don&#39;t have any more. Well, duh, I want to say, we don&#39;t have that one any more, we only rented that one!! But instead I try to get him set up with a game. He starts getting it ready, says he is fine to do it on his own and I go upstairs to try to go back to sleep (right...)<br/>\nI get up there and even though the big kid is watching cartoons, I start crying myself to sleep. Except without the sleep. I wonder if unschooling or non-coercive parenting or consensual living is even remotely possible when one parent works 12 hour night shifts. Why bother?

We aren&#39;t that into voluntary poverty. Simplicity, yes to some extent. I stretch dollars. But we are buying a house, 2 vehicles and a heck of a lot of student loans. My mother lives with us and doesn&#39;t help with living expenses aside from food. I am a night person through and through. I work 3 nights a week and get to be here and available as needed, even if I am not at my finest. It feels right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wish there was a way to ease into this more. I try saying yes. I have gotten better at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI forget to build up rather than tear down. I forget what is really important in these moments. Could one of you please monitor my audio feed and intervene as needed? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDH likes to pose the idea that I have chosen this path just because it *is* so difficult in order to raise my ideals and set myself up for failure. I have wondered the same thing. I have been known to do so in the past. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease help. Is it unreasonable to tell them to let me sleep 3 days a week for a few uninterrupted hours providing they aren&#39;t really in need of my intervention? But who am I to say when they really need me? <br/>\n<br/>\nIn theory, I don&#39;t mind waking up for every little thing. I want them to know they can trust me, that I am on their side.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice I am a monster when I wake up. Fear me!  I discovered that about me when the oldest was a newborn--if my feet have to touch the floor I go into rage mode. So we did the family bed after a week of hysterical crying on my part because I hated myself for feeling such &#39;untoward&#39; feelings toward my newborn. That worked great for us! No more raging mommy, only well-rested rolling over in bed mommy!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they are older, this is daytime. They get bored. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast week I bought cool stuff for the 6.5 year old to do while I was sleeping. HE left the lids off the markers. He still complained. Okay-- I get it. What he needs apparently is ME. But I need to rest...or they need to wake up and get their mommy fix on before I go to sleep. I am just grumpy when I wake up. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could stay up. But then I lack the mental faculties to really do my best brainstorming. If they could plan ahead and know going into the day that they need to be in charge of the activities, then it might work better. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere may be too many questions here, but I had to pour out my heart. I had a meltdown last week in the midst of PMS whose major recurring theme was something along the lines of &quot;@!%#$ unschooling, I don&#39;t need this baggage and shame!!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI really am a perfectly reasonable and logical person who understands USing in theory in so many levels. But I fail in practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I get more than ONE response this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Alice<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Everyone is raving about the  all-new Yahoo!
