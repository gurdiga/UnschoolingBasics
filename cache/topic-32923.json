I think it&#39;s funny that sometimes we get stuck on what a word means to us in our own lives and kind of forget that that word means something different to most people and has for a long time.  &#39;Broken&#39; is one of those words I think.  I bet if there was to be poll conducted, most people when hearing the word broken, would likely picture cracked, in pieces, unsalvageable, something that needs throwing away, etc.  So when the general use of the word is to describe something in this state, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s the best adjective to describe a child.  I actually wouldn&#39;t consider my child &#39;broken&#39; even if they couldn&#39;t walk at the age of 10.  I would surely consider it &#39;different&#39; though.  The only reason it would even be considered &#39;different&#39; is because most kids walk around 1.  Who says it wouldn&#39;t be just perfect for that child to<br/>\n walk at 10???<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: A question about diagnosing differences","postDate":"1211130887","msgId":32997,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcwcG82NytqNzZ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM4YjhhZiRlNTk2OWRlMCRiMGMzZDlhMCRAY29tLmF1Pg=="},"prevInTopic":32990,"nextInTopic":33001,"prevInTime":32996,"nextInTime":32998,"topicId":32923,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... broken - in ... 10, you ... being the ... normal/usual. ============= I would call that different, not broken.

That&#39;s not what I needed the diagnosis for.<br/>\nI needed it because I didn&#39;t understand just how his thinking was different.<br/>\nHaving the words &#39;autistic spectrum disorder&#39; gave me a handle to go and do<br/>\nsome research and find out exactly what the characteristics of ASD. For<br/>\nexample: he screamed a whole lot for a year or more. So I needed to know<br/>\nwhat was behind that. Is it a characteristic of ASD that he needs to do<br/>\nsomething with his voice, or is it that he not handling the uncertainty and<br/>\nthus is expressing his anxiety? (FYI it&#39;s the anxiety).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that not true of every single person on the planet? No two people&#39;s <br/>\nbrains function in the same way. I think a lot of parents assume their <br/>\nkids will &quot;think&quot; like them/act like them/BE like them. But they aren&#39;t <br/>\nlittle &quot;us&#39;s&quot;---they are completely and amazingly NOT &quot;us&#39;s&quot;. (that&#39;s <br/>\nhard to figure out: us&#39;s? uses? usses? &lt;g&gt; grammatically, it would be <br/>\nwe&#39;s or wees &lt;g&gt; Making up plural words here. &lt;BWG&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we look at our children as different, from the beginning...and <br/>\nforever, we can understand them *all* better and work on finding a way <br/>\nthrough with a better attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean: it&#39;s *not* just aspie/autistic kids that should get this gift! <br/>\nAll children have brains that function in different ways, and certainly <br/>\nnot all need diagnoses!<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely. No one is the same. You just have to do one of those personality<br/>\ntests to see that you can quantify the obvious - In the Myers Briggs scheme<br/>\nI&#39;m an INFJ - my husband is ENFP. It&#39;s helpful to us to be able to<br/>\nunderstand each other better so that we don&#39;t fall into the easy pit of<br/>\nthinking his messiness is laziness, or my organisational skills are<br/>\narrogance. My daughter is very different from me. She needs heaps more<br/>\nfriends around than I do. She hates dancing, whereas I would have given my<br/>\nright arm to do ballet lessons (although on second thought that wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave done my ballet skills much good...)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, with all our differences though, there are basic similarities in<br/>\nhuman child development. Eg. We expect every child to walk (eventually),<br/>\nunless they are missing their feet or have some muscular difficulty etc. We<br/>\nexpect every child to use the toilet eventually - whether you start with EC<br/>\nor nappies - unless they have some bladder issue etc. The things that are<br/>\nmissing from the development in autistic children are the things we don&#39;t<br/>\neven think about like - responding to and being able to use: facial signals,<br/>\ntone of voice, gestures, following  gaze to find something, following a<br/>\npoint. Most of the non-verbal relationship skills that babies under 18<br/>\nmonths develop automatically, autistic kids lack. Why do they lack them?<br/>\nBecause for whatever reason, their brains are not connecting in normal ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest issue with the aspie/autistic stuff is how much is being <br/>\ntried to FIX these kids. They are not broken. They just Are Who They <br/>\nAre. We can choose to work WITH them or we can choose to try to FIX <br/>\nthem. Working WITH them will have such sweeter benefits!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few things to say. Firstly, numbers of ASD children has<br/>\nincreased greatly in the last 20 years, such that they now say that 1 in 160<br/>\nchildren is &#39;on the spectrum&#39;. Of course, levels of intensity vary greatly.<br/>\nSo someone has to ask the question: why is this? And how can we stop the<br/>\nincrease? <br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, if you want to use the word &#39;broken&#39;, I think they are broken - in<br/>\nthe same way that if your kid had a problem walking at the age of 10, you<br/>\ncould consider something &#39;broken&#39;. &#39;Broken&#39; only refers to not being the<br/>\nsame as the majority - the same as what we would consider normal/usual. I&#39;m<br/>\nnot saying there&#39;s anything bad or wrong with being broken. Just that<br/>\nwhatever it is is not working as well as one would expect, given the regular<br/>\nstate of the world. And if you can do something about it, why wouldn&#39;t you?<br/>\nWhy do we do surgery on club feet and hare lips? Why do we find ways to<br/>\nbalance body chemistry of children with diabetes? Because &#39;fixing&#39; these<br/>\nthings helps the children who have them work in the way most others work and<br/>\nrelate to others better. <br/>\n<br/>\nAutism looks a little bit different because you can&#39;t see a physical<br/>\ndifference, and it&#39;s not life-threatening in general. But I would argue that<br/>\nrelationships are the key to a happy and fulfilled and joyful life. And if<br/>\nsomeone is lacking those basic relationship skills because their brain has<br/>\nnot had the opportunity to get &#39;wired&#39; in that way, why wouldn&#39;t you want to<br/>\ndo something about it if you could? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe limited research that has been done on autistic (mostly Aspergers)<br/>\nadults (three major studies) shows that only about 10-20% are able to hold<br/>\ndown a regular job. Less than 10% have a friend or intimate relationship.<br/>\nLess than 6% live independently. Over 80% suffer depression and other mental<br/>\nhealth issues. It&#39;s not a great scenario for an autistic kid. But if you can<br/>\ndo something to help that kid live a happy and joyful and relationship<br/>\nfilled life, why wouldn&#39;t you?<br/>\n<br/>\nThirdly, frankly, my child did need &#39;fixing&#39;. There are different ways ASD<br/>\naffects people, but when my child was diagnosed at 3, he had screamed all<br/>\nday every day for months. He couldn&#39;t go in or out of a doorway without<br/>\nscreaming. Noone could look at him without him screaming. He couldn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand a simple concept like &quot;we&#39;ll have that later&quot;. He couldn&#39;t answer<br/>\na question or make a simple choice without screaming. He didn&#39;t have one<br/>\nchild he liked or played with. He could speak, but he would only recite<br/>\nscripts from TV shows. He talked about Thomas the Tank Engine all day (when<br/>\nhe wasn&#39;t screaming). He was visibly anxious and unhappy. He needed help -<br/>\nmore help than I knew how to give.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne simple thing was changing his diet to exclude gluten and casein. Within<br/>\nthree weeks he was happier, brighter, more connected. It made a big<br/>\ndifference. Starting RDI therapy made another big difference. He still has a<br/>\nlong way to go to building his relationship skills, but he&#39;s well on the way<br/>\nand he&#39;s absolutely gorgeous and adorable. I love him to bits. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing: I&#39;m pretty sure my older brother (now 37) has autism. He&#39;s<br/>\nunable to think flexibly and gets confused in conversations. He is mildly<br/>\naffected and is one of the 10% who does ok as an adult, but he&#39;s never had a<br/>\ngirlfriend and I know he&#39;d love to be married. He&#39;s only ever had one friend<br/>\nwith whom it was a real relationship of peers - every other relationship<br/>\nI&#39;ve observed him in has had the other person doing all the work and &#39;being<br/>\nnice&#39; to him as opposed to relating to him on the same level. I think that&#39;s<br/>\nsad. I would have loved him to get the therapy my son has. It would have<br/>\nmade his life a lot happier and more joyful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt still boils down to it&#39;s being about *you* and not the kid. If we <br/>\ncan accept him How He Is, we don&#39;t need to label *ourselves* as &quot;mother <br/>\nof an aspie&quot;---we can just be mother of a great kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is something I have had a lot of trouble with, and a lot of grief<br/>\nabout. I&#39;ve had a lot of soul-searching to do about my ideas of &#39;perfect&#39;<br/>\nand &#39;acceptable&#39;. It has been a journey for me and I&#39;m extremely grateful<br/>\nfor it. No matter how my boy comes out in the end, I will love him and<br/>\naccept him just as I do now. But that doesn&#39;t stop me wanting to get him the<br/>\nmost effective help I can. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nCecily<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n_._,___ <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7644358,"authorName":"Kidgie@aol.com","from":"Kidgie@...","profile":"mama_de_julian_y_julia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:  A question about diagnosing differences","postDate":"1211057902","msgId":32980,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQwOC4zNTE0ZDZmZC4zNTYwYTBlZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32979,"nextInTopic":32990,"prevInTime":32979,"nextInTime":32981,"topicId":32923,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/17/2008 1:55:18 P.M.
