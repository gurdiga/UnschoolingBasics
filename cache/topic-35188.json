I suspect it worked for you  <br/>\nbecause of your son&#39;s unique personality that is perhaps drawn to  <br/>\ncataloging.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf parents want to provide unschooling (or even homeschooling) as a  <br/>\ngift to their kids, the parents shouldn&#39;t be placing contingencies on  <br/>\nit. If unschooling is the best way we know to bring kids up, then  <br/>\nit&#39;s up to us to figure out how to make it work, not up to the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said -- and it depends on the kid -- there isn&#39;t a problem in  <br/>\ngiving kids information on what we need for the state but the burden  <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be handed to them. It&#39;s just information.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo help unschooling flourish, it&#39;s much better to find ways to  <br/>\ninterpret what they&#39;re doing naturally into schoolish terminology  <br/>\nrather than telling them they need to do something we can report to  <br/>\nthe state. Unschooling doesn&#39;t need compromised for the state.

It wasn&#39;t an agreement if the consequences were in your control  <br/>\nsince power wasn&#39;t in balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a child who likes to write and catalog things, what you had him  <br/>\ndo might be fun. But in terms of unschooling, it&#39;s an unnecessary  <br/>\nbarrier between the child and learning. It&#39;s not necessary for  <br/>\nlearning. It&#39;s not necessary for the state. (Just the way you chose  <br/>\nto comply.) Goodness, I&#39;ve tried journals and diaries since I was a  <br/>\nkid, but keeping track of what I&#39;m doing, no matter what form I tried  <br/>\nto use (even on the computer), just doesn&#39;t interest me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but in order to comply with the laws he must learn something about<br/>\n&gt; each of the 5 basic subjects.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With unschooling there are no subjects, despite what a state says. My  <br/>\ndaughter playing video games is, though, using math (among other  <br/>\nthings). It&#39;s up to me to put that into words (strategy, percentages,  <br/>\nmapping).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The best part about it is that<br/>\n&gt; had I not given the responsibility of creating his own plan-book/diary<br/>\n&gt; I would never have done that stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We can&#39;t give responsibility. We can dump a burden on someone. We can  <br/>\nrequire that they comply with our wishes on how a task is accomplished.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut responsibility is something we take on voluntarily, knowing that  <br/>\nwe can drop it whenever we choose, knowing that we can do it to  <br/>\nwhatever standards we desire. Try to think of any responsibility you  <br/>\nhave you can&#39;t do that with. You may be adamant that you wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nchoose to drop it or lower certain standards, but the choice is still  <br/>\nyours and you&#39;re choosing not to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat freedom scares people. Well, what if the child decides to drop  <br/>\nthe responsibility? Then they&#39;ll think they can drop anything. Not  <br/>\ntrue (as unschoolers can testify from experience). When kids are  <br/>\ngrowing up being respected with the philosophy of treating others  <br/>\nwith respect, they understand the implications of responsibility. And  <br/>\nif they don&#39;t understand, then the responsibility was too much for  <br/>\nthem developmentally.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor unschooling to flourish, offering them opportunities works great.  <br/>\nBeing there to help them as much as they need us to works great.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He<br/>\n&gt; also decided that having an online course for math<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Showing kids who seem to enjoy such things that online (and in class)  <br/>\nmath courses exist can be part of unschooling.

A LOT in advance, <br/>\nbecause if I don&#39;t write it down, I&#39;ll forget (like park days or trips <br/>\nsomewhere or classes we take or whatever). So, it&#39;s an &quot;appointment <br/>\nbook.&quot; I also write things down *after* the fact, because a lot of <br/>\nlearning *happens* withOUT an appointment! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI write down snippets of conversations that we have---like during a <br/>\nmovie or in the car. Many people disregard conversations: they are <br/>\nprobably THE most important activity we engage in as far as our <br/>\nlearning goes. So, after a political ad, we may discuss the candidates: <br/>\npolitical science. When the puppy ran by with a tampon in her mouth: a <br/>\nbrief conversation about health & hygiene. &lt;g&gt; Or---recently a history <br/>\nmoment: &quot;Jim Crow&quot; was mentioned somewhere (probably Family Guy! &lt;G&gt;). <br/>\nIt fueled a 20-30 minute chat about the Civil War and racial tension <br/>\nand caste systems abroad and how I remember  (but barely) some of the <br/>\nJim Crow signs and the race riots as a small child (I was born in <br/>\n1960)...and all sorts of related things. Chances are that the boys will <br/>\nremember that way better than a chapter in a US history book. They may <br/>\nnot be able to recite a litany of facts, but the *idea* of Jim Crow is <br/>\nthere---they will make further connections as they learn and grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t discount *small* a-ha moments of learning!!! They *count*!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh---and if you don&#39;t know---look it up! Don&#39;t be shy about not knowing <br/>\nan answer! We found out more about Jim Crow Laws by googling it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school, kids are often isolated from REAL conversations. They spend <br/>\na LOT of their time *answering* questions--- when what they want and <br/>\nneed is to ASK questions and get good, helpful answers. Often their <br/>\nconversation at home revolve around &quot;what&#39;s on the test&quot; schoolwork and <br/>\nhomework and eating and sleeping and soccer/piano practice. They don&#39;t <br/>\nget to *share* and ask/have answered questions that are meaningful *to <br/>\nthem*.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling allows a LOT of time for that kind of shared learning. It <br/>\nallows a LOT of time for questions and ponderings.

A LOT in advance, <br/>\nbecause if I don&#39;t write it down, I&#39;ll forget (like park days or trips <br/>\nsomewhere or classes we take or whatever). So, it&#39;s an &quot;appointment <br/>\nbook.&quot; I also write things down *after* the fact, because a lot of <br/>\nlearning *happens* withOUT an appointment! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI write down snippets of conversations that we have---like during a <br/>\nmovie or in the car. Many people disregard conversations: they are <br/>\nprobably THE most important activity we engage in as far as our <br/>\nlearning goes. So, after a political ad, we may discuss the candidates: <br/>\npolitical science. When the puppy ran by with a tampon in her mouth: a <br/>\nbrief conversation about health & hygiene. &lt;g&gt; Or---recently a history <br/>\nmoment: &quot;Jim Crow&quot; was mentioned somewhere (probably Family Guy! &lt;G&gt;). <br/>\nIt fueled a 20-30 minute chat about the Civil War and racial tension <br/>\nand caste systems abroad and how I remember  (but barely) some of the <br/>\nJim Crow signs and the race riots as a small child (I was born in <br/>\n1960)...and all sorts of related things. Chances are that the boys will <br/>\nremember that way better than a chapter in a US history book. They may <br/>\nnot be able to recite a litany of facts, but the *idea* of Jim Crow is <br/>\nthere---they will make further connections as they learn and grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t discount *small* a-ha moments of learning!!! They *count*!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh---and if you don&#39;t know---look it up! Don&#39;t be shy about not knowing <br/>\nan answer! We found out more about Jim Crow Laws by googling it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school, kids are often isolated from REAL conversations. They spend <br/>\na LOT of their time *answering* questions---when what they want and <br/>\nneed is to ASK questions and get good, helpful answers. Often their <br/>\nconversation at home revolve around &quot;what&#39;s on the test&quot; schoolwork and <br/>\nhomework and eating and sleeping and soccer/piano practice. They don&#39;t <br/>\nget to *share* and ask/have answered questions that are meaningful *to <br/>\nthem*.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling allows a LOT of time for that kind of shared learning.
