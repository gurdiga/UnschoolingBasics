He whipped through Digital Fortress within a <br/>\nday or two -- and that is not a &quot;kid&quot; book.  But it had codes and <br/>\nsuch, a keen interest of his.

We approach it, though, as a partnership.  <br/>\nOften, I view us as co-learners, because I am filling in a number of <br/>\nmy own HUGE gaps.  Some of it, he is explaining to me, because, to <br/>\nbe honest, he is smarter than I am.  He does like to learn -- but <br/>\ncomputer games are very enticing, too, and he would probably spend <br/>\n15 hours a day playing Runescape.  (Hey, he needs to eat and sleep <br/>\nsome, too!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI view it for our family, somewhat as the same as discipline.  The <br/>\ngoal of discipline isn&#39;t punishment, but to develop self-discipline, <br/>\nso that when you need to do something, you can.  Or avoid doing <br/>\nsomething, in some cases.  When my son was in school (through 5th <br/>\ngrade), he learned unintended lessons, one of which was to be <br/>\nunfocused.  I only just realized this recently, through a discussion <br/>\nwith someone else, that it wasn&#39;t his natural inclination to <br/>\nconstantly daydream, but an effect of having been a disengaged <br/>\nlearner.  Even though the school (a small private school) TRIED to <br/>\nenrich his curriculum, it wasn&#39;t right for him.  I know if it <br/>\nweren&#39;t for the fact that the principal understood some of the <br/>\nissues involved, the schools could easily have tried to slap the ADD <br/>\nlabel on him.  The symptoms are very similar, but being bored out of <br/>\nyour mind is not the same cause, or cure.  I&#39;m delighted that my son <br/>\nhas figured out that he is a morning person (I knew for ages, but he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t accept it, and I didn&#39;t debate the point), and is now, with <br/>\nthe arrangement he initiated, developing (redeveloping, I suppose, <br/>\nsince he used to have it) focus.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKids REALLY need to come with instruction manuals.  They are all so <br/>\nunique, interesting, and the supposed guidelines are not much of a <br/>\nguide sometimes, are they?  It&#39;s like when I have read discussions <br/>\nand such on learning styles.  I really can&#39;t say what my son&#39;s <br/>\nlearning style is -- maybe multi-faceted.  I felt like a bad mom for <br/>\nthat.  (I felt like a bad mom when I hid the coloring books when he <br/>\nwas little, too.  Wouldn&#39;t color in them, but asked me to read them <br/>\nto him.  Do you have any idea how BORING they are to read?  But his <br/>\nview of books was, you read &#39;em.  Sigh.  Well, we are at a different <br/>\nstage now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is the kid who always asked me questions that I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nanswer, that both my base of knowledge and his were inadequate to <br/>\nthe explanations.  But he isn&#39;t self-propelled to gather the <br/>\nknowledge on his own, never really has been.  (For an only child, he <br/>\nis a very social learner!)
