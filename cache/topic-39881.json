She really didn&#39;t even know the <br/>\nsounds all the letters of the alphabet could make, before she was <br/>\nreading. She LEARNED a lot of the sounds by knowing the words and then <br/>\nfiguring out, over time, what sounds certain letters or letter <br/>\ncombinations were likely to make. For example, she eventually figured <br/>\nout the &quot;th&quot; sound, but not until she&#39;d memorized what a bunch of words <br/>\nthat contained &quot;th&quot; were. This is backwards from the way reading is <br/>\nusually taught - usually letter sounds are taught and the kid builds up <br/>\nto being able to use those letter sounds to &quot;sound out&quot; words. Rosie <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t sound out words, but she could recognize words without <br/>\nawareness of the sound of each letter or combinations of letters. When <br/>\nshe&#39;d built up a large set of recognizable words, she could read and <br/>\nthen she started to recognize sounds. I think because of the way she <br/>\nlearned to read, she really couldn&#39;t spell for years, though. She <br/>\nstarted reading at 8 years old and could read well, but she couldn&#39;t <br/>\nconsistently spell even really simple words until she was 15 or 16 years <br/>\nold. When it clicked for her, it clicked - she&#39;s a good speller now.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosie is a very physical person - she&#39;s graceful and coordinated. She&#39;s <br/>\nlearning sign language - taking a community college course - and she <br/>\nonly ever has to see and make a sign once and she never forgets it. Her <br/>\nfirst &quot;line of attack&quot; in learning anything is to somehow physically <br/>\n&quot;do&quot; it. If she&#39;d been in school, the constraint of sitting still and <br/>\ntrying to learn without moving would have been very bad for her. When <br/>\nshe started really reading, it was a play script - she was in the play - <br/>\nso the words were all connected with physical movement. I really don&#39;t <br/>\nthink that is a coincidence - the play was the bridge, for her, between <br/>\nphysical movement and reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Reading instruction programs are designed by people who live &quot;in their <br/>\nheads&quot; and liked school - they became professional educators. They may <br/>\ngive lip service to multiple intelligences, but they almost always treat <br/>\nintelligences other than linguistic as inferior and just to be used as <br/>\nsupplemental stuff - to make the real lesson more palatable to some <br/>\nkids. The idea that kids can entirely use their own strengths and styles <br/>\nof learning to learn to read completely differently than the way it is <br/>\ntaught in school - not something most people believe at all - not even <br/>\nmost homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is so odd that our society expects kids to learn certain things on a <br/>\nstandardized timetable. We certainly don&#39;t expect that of adults - I <br/>\nmean, doesn&#39;t it sound silly to say, &quot;His geography is at a 38 year old <br/>\nlevel?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat difference does it make if a kid learns to read at 3 or 9 or 12 or <br/>\n16 if he/she is living an experience-rich life filled with joyful <br/>\nlearning of other kinds than reading? It wouldn&#39;t matter at all if it <br/>\nweren&#39;t for two things - (1) expectations that earlier reading is <br/>\n&quot;normal&quot; lead to fear and anxiety that the child might not be okay - <br/>\nmight have some sort of neurological dysfunction, and (2) if the whole <br/>\nsociety around us didn&#39;t use reading as their key indicator of <br/>\nintelligence and sometimes shame and embarrass kids who read later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are work-arounds for those two problems for unschooling parents, <br/>\nanyway. Parental confidence can go a long way toward ameliorating tem <br/>\nand parents can do a lot to protect kids from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefits are HUGE. My daughter is so aware that she learned to read <br/>\nin her own way and time and that carries over to everything else. She <br/>\nhas no sense of needing other people to tell her what to learn or when <br/>\nto learn or how to learn - her mind is her own - her sense of self is <br/>\nstrong. Far from feeling disabled or &quot;less than&quot; others who read <br/>\nearlier, she feels enabled and empowered by doing it her own way.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":161101893,"authorName":"Lori","from":"&quot;Lori&quot; &lt;aldrichnine@...&gt;","profile":"lori_aldrich","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: reading and &#39;learning disabilities&#39; - is there such a thing?","postDate":"1241276389","msgId":39900,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd0aG41NStiamkxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGd0ZjBhaytiOGtkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39898,"nextInTopic":39905,"prevInTime":39899,"nextInTime":39901,"topicId":39881,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Truth is, we never know when our<br/>\nlast moments could be, so it&#39;s a pretty good way to live anyway!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that you really have to (in your mind) evaluate your child&#39;s lack of<br/>\nreading and how it truly effects his life.can he recognize an EXIT and STOP<br/>\nsign? (I once spent over an hour wandering around a mostly empty hospital in<br/>\nIsrael looking for the exit..i couldn&#39;t read the sign!)  also, he will learn<br/>\nwhen he is ready..with what motivates him.(menus in david&#39;s case). <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, a 50 year old friend of mine claims to have graduated totally<br/>\nilliterate from high school.he says he didn&#39;t learn to read until he was in<br/>\nthe military, so bored during down time he had no choice but to teach<br/>\nhimself to read to occupy himself.

He sees so much more than I do in a game, he is so tuned into so many more cues than I am. I look for words first, for instructions, for directions. Simon sees all that and more in examining a moment in a game. He listens so well, so much better than I do. Reading has handicapped me in many ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I lived in Japan I was illiterate. I had to look for other ways to get information. I had to ask for help, I had to talk to people, I had to memorize the bus ideogram for getting home so that I could get on the right bus. I had to watch for patterns in things. It was amazing to explore the world without written words to direct me, to corral me, to narrow my vision. It wasn&#39;t quite liberating, but it was certainly not a disability. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I know there are no unschooling children who have grown into illiterate adults. There are lots of schooled children who have. Reading is a skill that is mastered in its own time and in its own way. You&#39;ll just have to wait, patiently, and look for the skills that reading has pushed out in your life but have flourished in your son&#39;s life in its absence. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: conj123 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:connie.k.johnson@...\">connie.k.johnson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI never used to thing there was until now.
