Everything kids need to know they can learn organically - which is a pretty intimidating thought if you consider how much time kids spend in school, but most of that school time is spent doing very little, as I think you&#39;ve already discovered. I invite you to check out those sites, read about some unschooling days and lives and get a sense of how its possible to live with your family without ever dividing life up into &quot;work&quot; and &quot;play&quot; - no &quot;teachable moments&quot; or lessons of any kind! Its an amazing way to live... but it can take some time to wrap your mind around the idea that learning doesn&#39;t require teaching and that you can be your kids&#39; partner and friend rather than teacher and leader. <br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to ask questions or browse through the archives - and please check out those sites, there&#39;s tooooonnnnss of information to dig into. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 17)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":473204044,"authorName":"Tanya P","from":"&quot;Tanya P&quot; &lt;tanyaholic@...&gt;","profile":"tanya_phelps","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"New to unschooling","postDate":"1294244727","msgId":45773,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlnMjYxbitiajloQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43275,"nextInTopic":45774,"prevInTime":45772,"nextInTime":45774,"topicId":4029,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am so happy.

They are 7 and 5 and I am expecting soon. I decided that school was causing more heartache and problems within our family than anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son learned to read and type from trying to find and watch spiderman and sonic the hedgehog videos on the computer when he was only a toddler. He is very fast and has his own incentives to read. Especially now that he has some playstation games that have storylines and missions that he has to read to be able to play farther.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just bought my daughter a V-reader and for the first time she has started to show real recognition of letters and numbers. Before she just had no interest in reading and it seemed like nothing was sinking in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe school would just send home gigantic packets of things for the kids to do every day. I was overwhelmed. I couldnt understand how going to school for 8 hours a day they were sending home stuff for them to do. I told the school &quot;my kids are young. They need time to play and be with their families and eat and just be kids. They can&#39;t be just working and doing assignments all the time. There are plenty of adults who have a hard time focusing on an entire work day. We don&#39;t usually expect them to come home and spend home time doing work.&quot; I started to feel so far away from the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince they have been home with me I have doubted myself. Wondering if I am hurting their educational chances by having them learn at home. I started out with a really stringent curriculum. As time is passing i realize that they are learning best by spending the amount of time they want to spend on doing the work. Not just endlessly filling out worksheets.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really glad that I stumbled across this group and &quot;unschooling&quot; philosophy. It really feels good to have other parents with similar ideas about life and kids, who are living those ideals and sticking by their beliefs. This also seems like a great place to ask questions about parenting, teaching, and discipline without being judged for not imposing societal norms on my young, growing, happy family.  Thanks for having such a group! I look forward to talking to some of the other unschooling parents out there!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: New to unschooling","postDate":"1267641891","msgId":43275,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhtbWFuMys2cmhxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhtbGlkbCszN2xhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43274,"nextInTopic":45773,"prevInTime":43274,"nextInTime":43276,"topicId":4029,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Something else to consider, if you re new to unschooling is that school and even school at home can really interfer with a kid s natural ability to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1473766902\">Something else to consider, if you&#39;re new to unschooling is that school and even school at home can really interfer with a kid&#39;s natural ability to self-motivate. It comes back! but it does take some time. Its a good idea for parents to use that time to learn more about natural learning, because, as Schuyler said, it doesn&#39;t look like schoolish learning. Its good to be able to *see* that motivation happen when it does, to realize that a kid who is staying up half the night to beat a game as a highly motivated person, rather than more &quot;doing nothing&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nADHD can mean a lot of things - is there something in particular you&#39;re worried about? Is it that he bops from game to toy to show and doesn&#39;t seem to settle? That&#39;s the sort of thing that could be a good trait, if its something he&#39;s doing happily. Not every person needs to sit and focus to get things done. If its the sort of thing that bothers him, if he wants to focus but can&#39;t (and I mean He wants to focus, not that he&#39;s been told he Should want to focus, if you see what I mean) that&#39;s a different matter. <br/>\n<br/>\nSix is young. Its not uncommon for kids not to be reading until 8, or even older. Reading is a complex thing, and &quot;clicks&quot; for kids at different stages of development - some not until early adolescence! And really, its not vital for a young child to read. My 8yo read early, but mostly doesn&#39;t read. Its not something she enjoys. That could change as she gets older, but it doesn&#39;t have to. Not everyone has to read for pleasure in the same way that not everyone has to love to cook!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New to unschooling","postDate":"1267628633","msgId":43274,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI4MTQ4NS44MTQxNy5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhtbGlkbCszN2xhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhtbGlkbCszN2xhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43272,"nextInTopic":43275,"prevInTime":43273,"nextInTime":43275,"topicId":4029,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s easy to see other people s choices as idleness.

My son, Simon, he plays a lot of video games, he hangs out and chats with friends on-line, he watches lots of youtube videos and lots of movies. It doesn&#39;t look like anything educational could be going on, or that he has any motivation. But if you looked longer, if you hung out with him, if you listened as he talked about so many things, he is very well-educated, his life is producing a very enaged and engaging young man. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt 6 there is very little need to read or write. Linnaea, my daughter, was reading by 6, but my son didn&#39;t read until he was 12. There was no lack of learning in his life because of him not reading. He learned all the time. Linnaea&#39;s learning wasn&#39;t any greater than Simon&#39;s because of her reading. Reading is this wonderful thing for teachers to have their students do. It means that they can better manage a classroom of 20 to 30 students, they can give them a reading assignment. In real life, in a life with closer to one-on-one communication, reading is only one of many, many ways to get information. And reading is slower and less tailored to an individual than conversation is, then going to the grocery store can be, then playing a game like Runescape or World of Warcraft or Halo can be. <br/>\n<br/>\nLook for the learning where they are and in what they are doing. Sit and watch what they do. There are some good deconstructions of activities into educationese at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html,\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html,</a> in the pink/purple box on the side there are links to others. There is a lovely view of a day from two approaches at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschool/ginnyday.html.\">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/ginnyday.html.</a> Maybe those will help you see more of what is going on. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is a deconstruction of a life. Without school you get to keep it all whole and learn all the time without having to pigeonhole experiences into subjects or learning outcomes. Reading isn&#39;t separated from math or social studies or science or recess or whatever else, it all is, all together. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nHey there,My name is Sally.

She opted out of the ninth grade after hating school all her life. (long story) I am not imposing any structure on her at all. She sleeps past noon, watches all the TV she can stand, and spends time on the computer emailing and IMing. She also reads books and takes a guitar lesson once a week and has a community college class in digital photography. She is much happier, although she laments the loss of community she had in school. It was easier to find and make friends for her at school and she is very sociable. It seems harder to meet unschooled teenagers. Despite that, she still has no desire to go back to school. Her problem with school was the imposed structure and the meaninglessness of the work. Since she has been out of school, she has become more of her old self, singing silly songs and leaping around, stuff she hasnt done since she was 10 or 11. She also carries on lengthy conversations with me about interesting topics when it seemed<br/>\n like all we used to do was fight over things. I realize now how stressful school made our lives and the impact it had on our relationship. <br/>\nKathryn (in CA)<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;abcrewchief&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:link8131@...\">link8131@...</a>&gt; <br/>\nOkay, this is helping me, too.

I want them to be able to explore their creativity.  And in the process I can find my creativity and my passion and joy. We are on this journey together.  My children are opening my eyes to just how important it is to name moths and set them free.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for the support and good advice,<br/>\n<br/>\nreba<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.795 / Virus Database: 539 - Release Date: 11/12/2004<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Ultimately, I would check out most of the books based on what I thought was important.  Instead of giving them the freedom to forage.  The censoring, goes far deeper than just homeschooling methodologies.  It stemmed from my religious dogmatic beliefs, which I don&#39;t believe anymore.  <br/>\n <br/>\nReba<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

I am new to the group and new to unschooling. My name is Rebecca and I have three children ages 8, 6 , and 3. We live in Logan, Ut and have been homeschooling for 3 years. This is our fourth year. Through the years we have experimented with many varying approaches: rigid &quot;school at home&quot; and Charlotte Mason and Montessori and Classical. So we ended up with an eclectic homeschool method. Although, we never were relaxed. We&#39;ve bought curriculum and sadly, I&#39;ve made my girls do it thinking I was doing what was best for them in a twisted sort of way. My husband has supported homeschool from day one. When I started over a year ago to read Jon Holt and other unschooling materials I could get my hands on at the library and on line, husband didn&#39;t agree with complete child directed education. So I held back and continued with the eclectic approach with sometimes crying, sometimes angry, sometimes frustrated, and<br/>\nsometimes happy, content children. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me tell you all, this year I said, &quot;That&#39;s it! I am joining my girls with the revolution.&quot; My 6 year old, Jerusha, would cry every morning. Seriously! She did not want to do Saxon math. She did not want to learn how to read. She wanted to do handwriting when she felt like it AND she told me, &quot;Mama, I want more free time.&quot; That&#39;s what she needed. I&#39;ve always had a difficult time instructing my 8 year old. It was a roller coaster with with good days and bad days - the judgement basis of how well i was able to manipulate her in the quest of spoon feeding what i thought she should learn. Now this is really sounding twisted. Like I told you, we are having a revolution here!!! Hannah, 8 years old, is lovingly dubbed &quot;our idea girl&quot;. I think one of the first phrases she uttered was, &quot;I have an idea....&quot; With our rigid homeschooling approach, we were all plumb tuckered out by lunch, and we still had afternoon studies! So she didn&#39;t have the time she needed or wanted<br/>\nexplore her ideas or creativity. She would complain, &quot;I have so many ideas in my head that I can&#39;t concentrate.&quot; And sitting down at the kitchen table doing saxon math was not a conducive learning or even breathing enviroment for her. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, my 3 year old son, Eli, was being left in the dust. He wasn&#39;t getting the attention he needed. Like most 3 year olds, he needs lots and lots of love and attention and personal Mommy time. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am happy to say, THRILLED to say...WE DID IT!
