Small boys are<br/>\ndeveloping big muscles, big motor control, hand-eye coordination (like<br/>\nthrowing and jumping and such), balance, stuff that requires lots of<br/>\nmovin&#39; and shakin&#39; goin&#39; on. Classrooms require slow, quiet, sit, fine<br/>\nmotor control. Poor fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW my DS has never been &#39;schooled&#39; - we&#39;ve never been his &quot;teacher&quot;<br/>\nexcept insofar as all people learn from other people in one way or<br/>\nanother just by interacting. No lessons, no &#39;teachable moments&#39;, no<br/>\nworkbooks, no textbooks, no &#39;school time&#39;, etc. Yet &quot;somehow&quot; he can<br/>\nread, handle basic number skills, find China (and Hungary, and St.<br/>\nCroix, and Antarctica, and...) on a world map or globe, and so on. He<br/>\nloves sushi and sashimi and MASH and Star Wars and campfires and<br/>\nvideogames and lots of stuff and it&#39;s ALL connected. Life is a big web<br/>\nof connection, it&#39;s not a whole bunch of separate little<br/>\nend-in-themselves boxes. The written word, numbers, finding places/using<br/>\nmaps, etc are all tools that have meaning in *his* life so he absorbed<br/>\nthem, uses them, asks about them, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile unschooling is legally a &quot;form&quot; of homeschooling, the paradigm is<br/>\nvery different in practice - it&#39;s more about taking &#39;school&#39; out of<br/>\nliving life in this big wide world. It&#39;s more akin to what parents do<br/>\nnaturally with a toddler - providing a helping hand, resources, etc but<br/>\nyou don&#39;t do walking lessons or talking lessons (barring some sort of<br/>\nphysiological issues). You provide a safe space and a helping hand as<br/>\nneeded. As many of us can attest, there&#39;s no reason to change what you<br/>\ndo simply because of a birthdate on a calendar - the resources change,<br/>\ninterests change, abilities and developmental stages change, but the<br/>\nbottom line &quot;philosophy&quot; or attitude is the same.

We live next door in Kentucky, which is also a decent do it at home state, but Indiana is even better.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1781448068\">Hi Patience<br/>\n<br/>\nIndiana is a great state for home learning.  We live next door in <br/>\nKentucky, which is also a decent do it at home state, but Indiana is <br/>\neven better.  In Ky, we have to send a letter to the board of <br/>\neducation once a year at the beginning of the school year saying that <br/>\nwe&#39;re homeschooling.  That&#39;s it, really.  In Indiana, as I understand <br/>\nit, you don&#39;t even have to do that.  Sweet!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to go out on a limb here and toss out a couple of links.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve long held that there&#39;s no such thing as ADHD, that they are in <br/>\nfact manufactured diseases designed to sell drugs to children, and <br/>\nthat children have a tremendous amount of variation in their ability <br/>\nto pay attention to adult stuff.  I only throw this out because if I <br/>\nwere in the process of tossing out school, I&#39;d also be thinking about <br/>\ntossing out the ADHD label and just enjoy the son you have.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for social skills, I find that my kids, who have never been inside <br/>\na school, are extremely social, even though both my wife and I are <br/>\nfairly introverted.  They now drag us to participate more with <br/>\npeople.  I also find that unschooled/homeschooled children, when in <br/>\nsocial settings like parks, playing together are so much nicer, <br/>\nfriendlier and accepting than traditionally schooled children.  I <br/>\nwould suggest that institutional schools de-socialize children and <br/>\nthat social skills are something that will take care of themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also sounds as if, as someone new to this, you&#39;re still leaning <br/>\nmore toward homeschooling than unschooling at this point, which makes <br/>\nsense.  I gathered that from what you said about starting your son on <br/>\nreading.  My wife and I, to give a counter example, didn&#39;t do <br/>\nanything in terms of &quot;teaching&quot; our son to read, he pretty much <br/>\ntaught himself.  At 7, he&#39;s a fine reader.  My daughter, who&#39;s 4, <br/>\nloves to draw, and she&#39;s currently teaching herself to write.  She&#39;ll <br/>\nsit and write page after page of letters, lovely pictures of letters, <br/>\nand we&#39;ve never even suggested that she should learn to write.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sense of all of this is that its important to throw out the school <br/>\nin your head, the psychologists, the experts of all sorts, everyone <br/>\nwho draws a paycheck from an institution of any sort, the labels and <br/>\nthe shoulds and should nots, and just relax and focus on living your <br/>\nlife with your family, fully and joyously. At least that&#39;s what I try <br/>\nto do.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/ADHD-Fraud-Psychiatry-Patients-\">http://www.amazon.com/ADHD-Fraud-Psychiatry-Patients-</a><br/>\nChildren/dp/1412064589/ref=pd_sim_b_title_2/105-4332583-1426031<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sntp.net/ritalin/myth_1.htm\">http://www.sntp.net/ritalin/myth_1.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/myth_add_adhd.htm\">http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/myth_add_adhd.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Patience&quot; &lt;pgray1229@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello, my name is Patience.
