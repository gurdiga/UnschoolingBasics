Most nihilists <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t agree with my stance since most of them take a political <br/>\nstance against certain things. I believe that a true nihilist can <br/>\nhold no political position on anything without recognising he is just <br/>\nentertaining himself if he does. As far as what it looks like in my <br/>\nhome, My wife would probably take pascal&#39;s wager just to be safe and <br/>\nI leave it up to my children to believe however they like, but I do <br/>\nnot censor them to my beliefs.<br/>\nAgain, please believe me, I hold you in very high regards and do not <br/>\nconsider your precious daughter a red-zone....and by the way, red-<br/>\nzone is not a derogatory label, it is simply a label.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m befuddled by your posts, and I surmise that the conflict between<br/>\n&gt; your writing and my reading is your belief that nothing at all<br/>\n&gt; matters, if nothing matters, then it&#39;s hard to offer direction and<br/>\n&gt; maybe that&#39;s why I am confused by your writings.
