Emily purchased several manga books, Mary<br/>\nElayne wanted 3 new installments of Magic Treehouse, and Keon picked up a<br/>\nbook on the middle ages (particularly focusing on weapons, knights and<br/>\nhorses.)  We will probably go back again this week since Mary Elayne has<br/>\nalready finished 1.5 of the books we got just a few hours ago.  Speaking of<br/>\nwhich, does anyone have any ideas of similar books to the Magic Treehouse<br/>\nbooks that might be a little more in depth?  Mary Elayne loves the<br/>\ncharacters in these books and likes the premise (two kids get whisked away<br/>\nto some adventure (usually historical in nature) and find out cool things<br/>\nabout that place or time) but she is wanting something with more substance<br/>\nand involvement.  She can&#39;t stand the American Girl series and enjoys<br/>\nmysteries.  She&#39;s your typical 10.5yo velvet goth with purply-black hair and<br/>\na desire to own a zombie.
