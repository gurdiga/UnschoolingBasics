If you read the later printings of his earlier work you will<br/>\nsee how his ideas changed. He makes notes in some places to clarify and<br/>\noccasionally to express his regret for writing something or other.   I<br/>\nreally recommend the latest copies of all his books for that reason.  <br/>\nYou&#39;ll get a clearer understanding of his progression toward unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you can still find Growing Without Schooling somewhere, (Fun<br/>\nBooks, maybe?) get some old copies and read those.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a list: <br/>\n<br/>\n1964 - How Children Fail, by John Holt (Pitman Publishing)<br/>\n <br/>\n1967 - How Children Learn, by John Holt (Dell)<br/>\n <br/>\n1969 - The Underachieving School, by John Holt (Dell)<br/>\n <br/>\n1970 - What Do I Do Monday?, by John Holt (Dell)<br/>\n<br/>\n1972 - Freedom And Beyond,  by John Holt  (Dutton)  (Boynton/Cook; 1995)<br/>\n <br/>\n1974 - Escape from Childhood, by John Holt (Dell)<br/>\n <br/>\n1976 - Instead of Education, by John Holt (E.P.
