Yes, way too <br/>\nearly to think about college, but fears have a way of creeping into their <br/>\nminds (and mine too) every now and then. Sometimes they say to me that they feel <br/>\nlike they are &quot;stupid or dumb&quot; compared to kids in schools. That they feel <br/>\nlike they know they are behind or that they might want to go back some time. (I <br/>\nthink that is only some *candy coated* memories of school creeping into their <br/>\nminds also) I told them that they don&#39;t need to *compare* themselves to anyone, <br/>\never. That just because a kid is in school, doesn&#39;t mean he is smarter than <br/>\nthem! It just means that he is sitting at a desk every day being forced to *so <br/>\ncalled learn* things that he will most likely forget as soon as he walks out <br/>\nof the room, or at least by the time he graduates! I know I did. But, it weighs <br/>\non their minds every now and then. My 11 yo&#39;s best friend that lives across <br/>\nthe road is an unschooler and her Mom is sending her and her sister back to <br/>\nschool next year. (a charter school) I think both my dd&#39;s are worried that they <br/>\nare being left behind. I just have to find some ways to reassure them a bit. <br/>\nWhen I saw the posts about college, it was right after my dd mentioned college <br/>\nto me and I thought I&#39;d ask for any info.
