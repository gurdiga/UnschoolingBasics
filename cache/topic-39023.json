Life is stuff all jumbled together. From  <br/>\nthat chaos we focus on what we think is cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it makes more sense that we should learn better by isolating  <br/>\nwhat we are interested in so we could focus on it exclusively, that  <br/>\nisn&#39;t how we&#39;re hard wired to learn.

To see other things we&#39;re interested in relate.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it would make more sense if kids learned one word at a time,  <br/>\nthat isn&#39;t how kids learn.

They&#39;ve figured out how to do  <br/>\nthis from giving their children freedom to live life. The best thing  <br/>\nis to find out from them :-) They&#39;ve already done the work for you.  <br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to reinvent the wheel. Find your state homeschooling  <br/>\ngroup.

It&#39;s divided into  <br/>\nthose with power and those without power. This is The Truth. It could  <br/>\nbe if you hadn&#39;t mentioned more freedom in learning she wouldn&#39;t have  <br/>\nseen The Truth in a big flash.

This  <br/>\nbuilds strong relationships. Treat them like you would fellow humans.  <br/>\nIf you wouldn&#39;t demand your husband accompany you to the store, then  <br/>\nit&#39;s not respectful to do to a child. *Instead* you can say &quot;Hey, I  <br/>\nneed to go to the store later. Let&#39;s see how we can fit that into our  <br/>\nday. And after the store we can go to the playground.&quot; (That&#39;s *one*  <br/>\noption.) If you&#39;re imposing on someone&#39;s time, treat it like you&#39;d  <br/>\nwant someone else to treat you if they needed to impose on your time.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s being suddenly &quot;disrespectful&quot; of your needs because that&#39;s the  <br/>\nway she&#39;s been treated.

At least not ones we cared about!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do huge amounts of damage to our relationships with kids in the  <br/>\nname of forming them into better people, and into making life easier  <br/>\nfor ourselves. And most parents&#39; relationships with their teens shows  <br/>\nit! Society thinks teens are naturally snarky and rebellious. It&#39;s  <br/>\nnot true.

I wouldn&#39;t have told her she has that freedom if she really isn&#39;t going to!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI do see my approach as more of a choice compared to what she does at school.  At school there is very little choice over what she learns and the type of work she does.  The teacher simply passes out worksheets or dictates the assignment.  At home she would have a choice over the things she learns, the materials she uses, the amount of time she has to work on it and when she wants to move onto something else.  Keep in mind this whole philosophy is new to me, I also have to contend with my husband who isn&#39;t on board with this idea or approach.  I feel my approach is middle ground for now with the hope to dive completely into unschooling as we all get used to this new way of looking at life and learning. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you do this for yourself too? Think about how adults learn best. Think about how you treat your spouse or your best friends.

YOu told her she&#39;d have choice but it wasn&#39;t the truth at all. If you&#39;re going to not give her the choice, then don&#39;t tell her she&#39;ll have it. We&#39;re not talking about a situation where she wants to hurt someone and you&#39;re taking away that option...we&#39; re talking about letting her choose activities right? Breathe deep and realize that she learned an entire language without &quot;subject boxes&quot;. Pretend like today is summer vacation and have FUN together. The learning will keep happening. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI also told my daughter that there were going to be times or situations where she won&#39;t have a choice over what we do or need to get done.  She is pulling this card at inappropriate times like when I need to do an errand and obviously can&#39;t leave her home alone.  She is the child and I am the parent and for now do have the authority to decide what she can have some control over and what she can&#39;t.  I am taking baby steps with this new way of parenting and educating.  I am figuring it out as I go and maybe need to use different language when talking to her about what homeschooling will be. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nJen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: How do you control the power of choice","postDate":"1237953157","msgId":39075,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdxYzlxNSs2MHRpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDI5MzQ3Ny4yMzc1MC5xbUB3ZWI0NTMxMy5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39063,"nextInTopic":39076,"prevInTime":39074,"nextInTime":39076,"topicId":39023,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~I agree that children need a semblance of routine they come to expect things to happen at certain times like the sun rising and setting.

At first I thought we could apply it just to academics. Then my husband and I sat and talked about it, he was on board with homeschooling but he felt that as the parents we still needed to be in complete control. So we compromised. What a disaster. I got my husband to finally read a lot of the books, websites, blogs, etc out there about unschooling. I wanted him to process the information in his own way so he could come to the same conclusion I already had. Once he began to assimilate all of that and really started paying attention to what was going on with the kids and myself he jumped on board. Could we be considered radical unschoolers, probably not yet. DH and I still have our hang ups but we realize that they are our hang ups and not our kids and we all talk about it and the things that we can do to change them. It doesn&#39;t happen over night but if you relax and trust in your basic<br/>\n instincts and your children&#39;s instincts it will happen faster than you think. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for controlling the power of choice as you put it. You are empowering your daughter by giving her a choice and then to control that decision making process isn&#39;t really a choice. She is going to make good ones, bad ones and indifferent ones. It is part of learning. Unfortunately it is something that we as adults and the way most of us have been condition by society that we believe kids are incapable of making choices on their own. They aren&#39;t little adults but they definitely have the same intelligence and abilities that we have as adults. The difference boils down to, in my opinion, the number of years experience and the types of experiences we have as adults to put behind our decisions. That is what we need to share with and show our kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI love structure and organization and have all of my stuff organized into folders, etc. I think my daughter rebelled more against the school like structure we tried to install than anything else. Believe it or not just by observing the things she likes to do you will find out where her interests are. As for documentation it could be quite simple. Think about any activity and see how many school subjects you can apply to it. Keep some sort of journal just for the purpose of jotting down things that have been done during the day and think about how they apply to each traditional subject. Grocery shopping, for example, math, reading, science, etc all can be applied. The math aspect, well you have $100 to purchase what you need for the week. In order to take in account taxes you will round up items to the nearest dollar, for instance. Then you have to add these figures and subtract from 100 to see if you have enough to keep going. When she gets older you can<br/>\n teach percents this way and decimals. You will also have to count to make sure you have the correct number of items if you want to try for an express lane. Reading, it is wise to read the nutrition and ingredient labels, store circular, sale signs, etc. Science (ok I am biased and it happens to be one of my favorite subjects) looking for spoilage and talking about what may or may not have caused spoilage; preventing spoilage when you get home. Cheeses that are made with mold, bacteria in yogurt, yeast. You can cover geography as to why some things are only available locally and why they are available in other places. Where foods come from, international food aisle. This will lead to discussions and research about different cultures. And that was just one trip to the grocery store. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo feel safe children&#39;s needs are very simple. Love, trust, compassion and understanding. Structure is by product of previous centuries during the industrialization. When we moved from an agrarian society to an industrialized one. There was structure on the farm but it was not as time sensitive as what was needed for industry and manufacturing. The idea that we need to have a very set structure for our children has come from what society has been groomed over the last century to believe. It produces good laborers. It produces good factory workers. It produces people who will not question the status quo. Farm life required a certain routine not structure. Industry requires structure such as strict schedules, hierarchies from the little workers all the way up to the CEO. The words routine and structure are often interchanged and not correclty. <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that children need a semblance of routine they come to expect things to happen at certain times like the sun rising and setting. There is comfort in knowing what is happening and what will be happening. If you child knows your husband is going to leave for work at 6 am and be home by 5 pm it becomes part of their day, their routine. To make that into structure would mean you are getting your child up at 5 am to have breakfast with daddy, then see him off to work, then start school, break for lunch, finish school work and then get ready for daddy to come. (I am not saying this is what you do, I am trying to illustrate the difference between routine and structure.) Every minute is accounted for and has something required of it. Knowing that daddy leaves and comes home at the same time and that inbetween is time with mommy to get through various parts of the day is routine. It doesn&#39;t have to be at exact times, just regular pattern to the day. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor many different reasons I personally have a weird schedule. However, my kids have fallen into a routine that doesn&#39;t necessarily match my own. They get up when they are ready in the morning, I avoid waking them up before they are ready it leads to a horrible day unless there is a real reason for it. My daughter eats breakfast right away, my son doesn&#39;t like to eat right away. Around 11 am breakfast is done, we work as a unit to clean up so that we can get on with the day&#39;s adventure, whether it is gaming, reading, field trip, whatever. Lunch/snack gets tossed into some point in the day. My husband works nights so he spends times with the kids in the late afternoon and evening and then we start quieting the house down. My daughter likes get ready for bed and typically will watch one of her shows and then go off to read a book her play quietly in her room. She is starting to express a bit more independence. Our son has been transitioning from sleeping<br/>\n in our bed to sleeping in his own so he asks for mommy to read to him and sing him a song, then daddy has to do the same and before you know it he is off to sleep. That is routine not structure, the children do actually get a little lost when things change, depending on the change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/\">http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/\">http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://myspace.com/mamabeart00\">http://myspace.com/mamabeart00</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231930081,"authorName":"DJ250","from":"&quot;DJ250&quot; &lt;dj250@...&gt;","profile":"wibberbie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] How do you control the power of choice clarification","postDate":"1237930118","msgId":39056,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM0N0JFQ0ZDODNFNzRFMTU4RjIzNjdDN0NFREFCREJFQFJvY2tldFNhdWNlMj4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY0MzY2NC44MjIxOC5xbUB3ZWI0NjAwNi5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDY0MzY2NC44MjIxOC5xbUB3ZWI0NjAwNi5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39053,"nextInTopic":39060,"prevInTime":39055,"nextInTime":39057,"topicId":39023,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Jennifer, I think one idea that s central to unschooling, esp. radical unschooling (if you want to call it that!) is treating your child as a partner and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1037228919\">Jennifer,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one idea that&#39;s central to unschooling, esp. radical unschooling (if you want to call it that!) is treating your child as a partner and guide, rather than putting yourself in the position of director.  <br/>\nSo, finding a time together when you&#39;re both able to go to the store is more beneficial to both of you than for you to be the one dictating when it&#39;s time to go to the store.

Keep in mind I am the product of the formal school experience and it is difficult to change over night.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Just recognize that it&#39;s your own issue and no wonder your child balks at the hypocrisy of being told she has choice when she doesn&#39;t. I wouldn&#39;t have told her she has that freedom if she really isn&#39;t going to!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I do see my approach as more of a choice compared to what she does at school.  At school there is very little choice over what she learns and the type of work she does.  The teacher simply passes out worksheets or dictates the assignment.  At home she would have a choice over the things she learns, the materials she uses, the amount of time she has to work on it and when she wants to move onto something else.  Keep in mind this whole philosophy is new to me, I also have to contend with my husband who isn&#39;t on board with this idea or approach.  I feel my approach is middle ground for now with the hope to dive completely into unschooling as we all get used to this new way of looking at life and learning. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you do this for yourself too? Think about how adults learn best. Think about how you treat your spouse or your best friends. I don&#39;t have &quot;subject boxes&quot; at work or at home or anywhere in life. this is a way society treats school-age children only. It&#39;s weird.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I am a very structured/organized person and do have folders and other ways of organizing my personal materials.  I plan to use the subject boxes as a jumping off point as a way to see what my daughter is interested in and discover the style or way she learns the best.  I think she will initially respond better to the things she is used to doing instead of taking away all the structure at once and telling her to just do whatever she wants.  Children do need structure to feel safe and be able to grow.  I also have to submit documentation to the superintendent as to what she is learning so I do need some tangible information not just that I let her do her thing and trust that she is learning (although I do personally believe that will happen). <br/>\n<br/>\n  Smart kid. YOu told her she&#39;d have choice but it wasn&#39;t the truth at all. If you&#39;re going to not give her the choice, then don&#39;t tell her she&#39;ll have it. We&#39;re not talking about a situation where she wants to hurt someone and you&#39;re taking away that option...we&#39; re talking about letting her choose activities right? Breathe deep and realize that she learned an entire language without &quot;subject boxes&quot;. Pretend like today is summer vacation and have FUN together. The learning will keep happening. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I also told my daughter that there were going to be times or situations where she won&#39;t have a choice over what we do or need to get done.  She is pulling this card at inappropriate times like when I need to do an errand and obviously can&#39;t leave her home alone.  She is the child and I am the parent and for now do have the authority to decide what she can have some control over and what she can&#39;t.  I am taking baby steps with this new way of parenting and educating.  I am figuring it out as I go and maybe need to use different language when talking to her about what homeschooling will be. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n  Jen <br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  No virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\n  Checked by AVG - www.avg.com <br/>\n  Version: 8.0.238 / Virus Database: 270.11.26/2020 - Release Date: 03/24/09 09:19:00<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] How do you control the power of choice clarification","postDate":"1237927953","msgId":39060,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUxNjgzNS41MDgwOS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNC5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDQ3NTM2NS42MTgyLnFtQHdlYjM3NDAxLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDcwNDk4My42NTk5Ni5xbUB3ZWI0NjAxNi5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39056,"nextInTopic":39061,"prevInTime":39059,"nextInTime":39061,"topicId":39023,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It might help you a lot if you actual come up with an educational philosophy.

Really sit down and think about what it is that you feel you can only learn in a structured environment and why and why, at 6, your daughter needs to have those things structured into her life. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy educational philosophy is based on the idea that learning happens all the time. Simon and Linnaea, as am I, are learning from everything in their world all the time. What they learn in any given moment has a huge amount to do with how they feel. If they aren&#39;t at their best, if they are hungry or tired or feeling that buzzy grouchy feeling that can come from feeling pushed to do something, their learning is far more to do with how they feel and how unfair something is than it is anything to do with what is going on in that moment. The learning is rarely about the same as it is when it is something they are interested in at a moment when they are feeling relaxed and happy and sated.  If your daughter is feeling pinned down by the rules you say you are freeing her from than her learning will have little to do with what you want and much more to do with how she feels. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt 9 and almost 12 I can think of nothing that they have needed  structured environment to learn. They have chosen on occasion to take classes like karate or horseback riding, those were skills that they wanted to pursue for a while within a tutorial environment. When they were done with those classes they stopped going, their choice. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps alot to say yes more than to abandon all rules at a go. It makes you tense, whatever it does to your child, and less likely to feel relaxed and happy during the transition. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Jennifer Croce &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jennifercroce37@...\">jennifercroce37@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 24 March, 2009 2:50:19 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] How do you control the power of choice clarification<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if I wasn&#39;t very clear, I am still in the planning stage so I don&#39;t have this all figured out yet.  Since this is new to me I probably won&#39;t radically unschool from the get go since I need the security of the structure that goes with conventional schooling.  This being said, I plan to have subject boxes with different materials for my daughter to choose from.  If something particular strikes her interest we will take off from there.  I guess I am semi-unschooling but hope to be doing it more and more as I let go of the conventional way of thinking about education and get more comfortable with homeschooling in general.  I have been explaining that she will have more choice over what she does and how she learns it compared to school where she is simply given worksheets or has to take a spelling test . <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my problem is that now when I ask or tell my daughter to do something and she doesn&#39;t particularly want to do it she&#39;ll complain and whine that it isn&#39;t her choice.  I am trying to think of a specific example but of course nothing comes to mind right at this second.  It just feels to me like she is taking advantage of this new philosophy and I don&#39;t quite know when I should put my foot down and when to let her decide.  I feel it is confusing to tell her sometimes she has choices and sometimes she doesn&#39;t.  Sorry, I know I&#39;m not explaining this well, I am tired and feeling a bit overwhelmed with all of this.  I appreciate everyone&#39;s advice and support.  I think I am just suffering from anxiety and fear about whether or not I am doing the right thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJen  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

It&#39;s weird.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am a very structured/organized person and do have folders and other ways of organizing my personal materials.  I plan to use the subject boxes as a jumping off point as a way to see what my daughter is interested in and discover the style or way she learns the best.  I think she will initially respond better to the things she is used to doing instead of taking away all the structure at once and telling her to just do whatever she wants.  Children do need structure to feel safe and be able to grow.  I also have to submit documentation to the superintendent as to what she is learning so I do need some tangible information not just that I let her do her thing and trust that she is learning (although I do personally believe that will happen). <br/>\n<br/>\nSmart kid. YOu told her she&#39;d have choice but it wasn&#39;t the truth at all. If you&#39;re going to not give her the choice, then don&#39;t tell her she&#39;ll have it. We&#39;re not talking about a situation where she wants to hurt someone and you&#39;re taking away that option...we&#39; re talking about letting her choose activities right? Breathe deep and realize that she learned an entire language without &quot;subject boxes&quot;. Pretend like today is summer vacation and have FUN together. The learning will keep happening. <br/>\n <br/>\nI also told my daughter that there were going to be times or situations where she won&#39;t have a choice over what we do or need to get done.  She is pulling this card at inappropriate times like when I need to do an errand and obviously can&#39;t leave her home alone.  She is the child and I am the parent and for now do have the authority to decide what she can have some control over and what she can&#39;t.  I am taking baby steps with this new way of parenting and educating.  I am figuring it out as I go and maybe need to use different language when talking to her about what homeschooling will be. <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: How do you control the power of choice clarification","postDate":"1237906656","msgId":39047,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdxYXNkMCs3a3AwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDcwNDk4My42NTk5Ni5xbUB3ZWI0NjAxNi5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39037,"nextInTopic":39053,"prevInTime":39046,"nextInTime":39048,"topicId":39023,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~~ Since this is new to me I probably won t radically unschool from the get go since I need the security of the structure that goes with conventional","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-661639699\">~~~ Since this is new to me I probably won&#39;t radically unschool from the get go since I need the security of the structure that goes with conventional schooling.~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nJust recognize that it&#39;s your own issue and no wonder your child balks at the hypocrisy of being told she has choice when she doesn&#39;t.

Screw this!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk to her about freedom. *Not* with a &quot;You&#39;re wrong and I need to  <br/>\nchange you,&quot; attitude. Because she *is* right. Tell her that  <br/>\nsometimes people&#39;s choices hurt other people or make life harder for  <br/>\nother people, so while we do have freedom of choice, we also don&#39;t  <br/>\nwant people to hate us, so we also keep other people in mind when we  <br/>\nchoose.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now *you* need to keep her in mind when you&#39;re choosing.
