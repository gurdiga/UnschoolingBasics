So far all I&#39;ve been able to find is some type of beauty college <br/>\ntraining where she studies to become an esthetician.  I&#39;m hoping to get to <br/>\nthe mall in the near future and talk to some of the ladies working at the <br/>\nmake-up counters.  Can anyone add any other ideas?<br/>\nTIA, Kathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6459,"nextTopicId":6476}}
