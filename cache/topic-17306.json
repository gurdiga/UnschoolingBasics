It&#39;s  <br/>\nthat we trust that they&#39;re trying to get their very real needs met.  <br/>\nWe trust that they *do* care about being safe and free from pain but  <br/>\nthat sometimes something gets in the way and we need to treat it  <br/>\nseriously. And sometimes they need to put up with discomfort (like  <br/>\nbeing grumpy after staying up all night) in order to experience  <br/>\nsomething. So unschoolers think outside the box, trying to find  <br/>\nsolutions other than &quot;do whatever you want&quot; and &quot;you have to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So one example was her son who<br/>\n&gt; is 3, they were at the beach and he didn&#39;t want to neither use sun<br/>\n&gt; blocking cream nor use a hat, and absolutely refused it no matter<br/>\n&gt; what they explained (which they kindly did). Then they said they had<br/>\n&gt; to go home � they went into the car, there he promised to use the<br/>\n&gt; hat.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What she created was a power struggle. The only choice she gave him  <br/>\nwas to do what she wanted in the way she wanted it. There had to be a  <br/>\nwinner and a loser and she was determined she&#39;d be the winner.  <br/>\n(Against a 3 yo :-/)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we become their partners then there are no power struggles. If we  <br/>\ngive up &quot;the one right solution&quot; and see ourselves as their partners,  <br/>\nthere&#39;s no reason for there to be winners and losers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; even if<br/>\n&gt; it means burning their skin  or imflaming the wound that was already<br/>\n&gt; healed<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It also helps to look at what are real things to worry about an what  <br/>\nare fears to indulge &quot;just in case.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe medical community has us so frightened of the sun that it seems  <br/>\nlike one case of sunburn and the child is doomed to skin cancer. But  <br/>\nit&#39;s no more true than skipping brushing teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s long term, life time habits that increase the risk of skin  <br/>\ncancer (barring exceptionally fair skin and a history of skin cancer.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s helpful to step back when that need to pressure comes and ask  <br/>\n&quot;Who&#39;s going to die if I let this happen?&quot; It&#39;s better to give  <br/>\ninformation to help a child make decisions -- and if we&#39;ve been  <br/>\ntreating them with respect they trust that our information *is*  <br/>\nintended to help and not code for &quot;do it my way or you&#39;ll be sorry&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I said that unschoolers don&#39;t expect their children to even want to<br/>\n&gt; watch these kind of movies<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually some kids do. And some kids are fine with more than their  <br/>\nage would suggest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut other kids are curious and want to test their limits. That&#39;s a  <br/>\ngood thing! We should always be checking and testing our limits  <br/>\nbecause we&#39;re always growing and changing. So unschoolers would  <br/>\n*help* the child watch a scary movie. We&#39;d get it on DVD so we could  <br/>\npause and talk, or skip over parts the child wanted to skip, stop it  <br/>\nand watch it later (or never), look at and discuss Making Of  <br/>\ndocumentaries that are on the DVD to see how effects were created,  <br/>\nwatch it during the morning. All sorts of ideas between &quot;whatever&#39;  <br/>\nand &quot;no.&quot;!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is to empower the child. We *don&#39;t* say &quot;Go, do whatever  <br/>\nyou want and find out the bad consequences that I&#39;m trying to tell  <br/>\nyou about in order to stop you from doing that foolishness.&quot; We  <br/>\nessentially say &quot;Let&#39;s find a way to do this.&quot; Explore and try it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; she brought up a<br/>\n&gt; hitchcock movie she saw when she was 6 (the birds or soemthing) and<br/>\n&gt; how she was afraid of birds for her whole childhood and had<br/>\n&gt; nightmares and so on)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Was she unschooled? Did she express her fears as she was watching and  <br/>\ndid her parents take those fears seriously? Did she feel empowered to  <br/>\nsay &quot;No, thanks.&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nConventional parenting *is* a lot of &quot;No&quot; and &quot;Whatever you want, I&#39;m  <br/>\nbusy.&quot; Not entirely but it characterizes a lot of it. Kids don&#39;t feel  <br/>\nthat their parents are their partners in their exploration.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well, she said that NOW at 7 they wouldn&#39;t want to watch those things<br/>\n&gt; but in a few years... she said just like an adult would still be<br/>\n&gt; curious even if their husband/wife would tell them kindly not to<br/>\n&gt; watch something because X, they would probably still want to watch<br/>\n&gt; it, accepting the consequences which a child couldn&#39;t forsee.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t a reason for a child to &quot;accept the consequences&quot; if the  <br/>\nparent sees their relationship with the child as a being their  <br/>\npartner in their explorations. I have warned my daughter about moving  <br/>\nskeletons in movies (her fear). I have found (on http:// <br/>\nwww.screenit.com) detailed descriptions of when scary scenes are  <br/>\ncoming up so I can warn her if she wants to see a movie. If she wants  <br/>\nto watch it, I help her. If she wants to watch it several years from  <br/>\nnow, I help her.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour friend is projecting the reactions of a conventionally parenting  <br/>\nchild onto an unschooling child. She is seeing the only way of  <br/>\nraising children is to forbid them from doing things that will harm  <br/>\nthem and can&#39;t see how respectful parenting will achieve that. But  <br/>\nthe goal of respectful parenting isn&#39;t just a different way to  <br/>\ngetting the child to do what the parent wants, or stepping back and  <br/>\nletting the child learn on his own. It&#39;s a partnership. It&#39;s helping  <br/>\nthe child.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband would *not* say &quot;Don&#39;t watch that movie,&quot; and then expect  <br/>\nme to trust his word and not watch it. He&#39;d tell me &quot;I don&#39;t think  <br/>\nyou&#39;d like it because of such and such,&quot; and would trust that I trust  <br/>\nwhat he&#39;s saying is true and helpful. He&#39;d give me information. He&#39;d  <br/>\nsee the purpose as helping me find things I enjoy and avoid things I  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t enjoy. Just as I do with him. *In addition* to information,  <br/>\nwith a child, I&#39;d help them explore something they might have  <br/>\nproblems with. I&#39;d *trust* that they were discovering new things  <br/>\nabout themselves by exploring.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean they always &quot;learn&quot; what we want them to. A  <br/>\nmomentary pain of pulling off a plaster needs taken seriously and not  <br/>\ndismissed. Letting the child &quot;find out for himself&quot; isn&#39;t respectful  <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s making choices to avoid pain! Finding *other* ways to  <br/>\nremove the plaster would be respectful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; An<br/>\n&gt; adult could handle the consequences (fear, nightmares) better, but<br/>\n&gt; children couldn&#39;t and she said there have been research where they<br/>\n&gt; showed children agressive movies and then someone would hit the<br/>\n&gt; child, and those children who watched agressive movies reacted way<br/>\n&gt; more agressive than the others who hadn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The studies really don&#39;t mean much.<br/>\n<br/>\nWere the children choosing the movies they wanted to watch when they  <br/>\nwanted to watch them?<br/>\n<br/>\nMost kids *do* imitate what they&#39;ve seen. Does that mean they toss  <br/>\nout the values of their family, turn their backs on being treated  <br/>\nkindly and with respect, and adopt violent values from watching a  <br/>\nmovie? Not with unschooling families.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So her point was, it is<br/>\n&gt; proven to be damaging if they watch such things.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds plausible in theory but it doesn&#39;t play out long term in real  <br/>\nunschooling families where children&#39;s needs and wants are being  <br/>\ntreated with respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I said that I would be watching with her if she wanted to<br/>\n&gt; watch something &quot;dangerous&quot;, she said that was quite time consuming<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kids *are* time consuming! They aren&#39;t something to take out and play  <br/>\nwith when it&#39;s convenient for us and set aside when more important  <br/>\nthings come along.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and if would I sit next to her each time at each hour in the day<br/>\n&gt; whenever she wants to watch something<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You wouldn&#39;t *need* to be there every hour. Goodness! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids are really sensitive and they know it and their moms know  <br/>\nit. Some are even bothered by Disney. They wouldn&#39;t be parking  <br/>\nthemselves in front of the TV with scary movies on!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has  always had free rein of the TV. If something bothers  <br/>\nher she changes the channel. She feels she&#39;s more powerful than the  <br/>\nTV. If she *wants* to watch something she fears might bother her,  <br/>\nshe&#39;d ask for help because she trusts me to help her explore what  <br/>\ninterests her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; would I be advising her each<br/>\n&gt; time if she should be watching X or Y?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We trust that they can learn. We trust that they&#39;re intelligent. We  <br/>\ndon&#39;t trust that they&#39;ll get it right all the time. They&#39;ll make  <br/>\nmistakes and that&#39;s okay because that&#39;s how humans learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do trust my daughter to try out a show and decide if she&#39;d like to  <br/>\ncontinue or not. I do trust that she can see the difference pretty  <br/>\nquickly between a cartoon for adolescents and a porno slasher film!  <br/>\nThere&#39;s no reason to tell her what to watch! TV shows are pretty much  <br/>\nthe same from week to week as far as level of violence and sex. It&#39;s  <br/>\nreally movies that they may need some advice on. It&#39;s hard to tell  <br/>\nthe level of intensity in a movie just from previews and the package.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s where reviews and websites are helping so we can help them  <br/>\ngather information to make more informed decisions. And then *help*  <br/>\nthem through anything that might be difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":280005589,"authorName":"Solé","from":"=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Sol=E9?= &lt;solelokuai@...&gt;","profile":"solelokua","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Impossible not to use coercive methods","postDate":"1158565932","msgId":17319,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkyQTFFRUZDLTA1RDctNDNEMS04NDFGLTczNzU3MUZCRkQxRUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVla245YitraGQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVla245YitraGQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17306,"nextInTopic":17323,"prevInTime":17318,"nextInTime":17320,"topicId":17306,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
