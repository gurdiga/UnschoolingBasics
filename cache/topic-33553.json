DS<br/>\ngot another half dozen DIFFERENT forms of Nerf dart guns for his<br/>\nbirthday last week. It&#39;s REALLY hard to hurt a human with them. The same<br/>\nwobbliness that causes the gun to waver around while pumping it up also<br/>\nmakes it really hard to get the kind of close up direct hit that might<br/>\npossibly damage a face. We&#39;ve got the machine gun one - DH is the only<br/>\none who uses it most of the time, because it takes way to much arm<br/>\nstrength/time to pump it (DS is 10 and can&#39;t handle it). DS&#39; current<br/>\nfavorite he got this weekend - instead of pumping it&#39;s more of a slide<br/>\naction to cock the thing (think pump action shot gun)  - no air<br/>\nresistance to pump up. He also got a &#39;skeet&#39; type set that fires disks<br/>\ninto the air to be shot with the Nerf gun. We do have basic rules of<br/>\nengagement - not in the living room (too many things that might get<br/>\nknocked down AND too many places to lose darts under and behind); point<br/>\nweapons down while in motion; aim only for torsos (mis-aimed shots that<br/>\nstart out aimed at a torso rarely him a face, they tend to either<br/>\ntotally miss or they hit an arm or leg more than a face) or targets; if<br/>\nyou need to take a break (potty, water, etc) you put your weapon down on<br/>\nthe ground/floor so that there&#39;s no mistaking whether you&#39;re a suitable<br/>\ntarget, anyone carrying a weapon is presumed to be a willing participant<br/>\nand a viable target for any battle game that is in progress. We&#39;ve yet<br/>\nto have any injuries even with DH involved (he has the arm strength and<br/>\naiming skill to hit the targets at a good range BUT Nerf stuff catches<br/>\nevery stray bit of air and tend to lose momentum pretty quickly).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

I could have forced him to wear the one that made him gag but<br/>\ntruly what would I have gained?

I feel better <br/>\nnow about joyfully supporting future condiment requests! <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing new to RU, saying &quot;yes&quot; isn&#39;t quite instinctive. I&#39;m still <br/>\nthinking a lot about some issues. I feel slow with my risk analysis <br/>\nabout whether certain requests/actions constitute a real danger or <br/>\nnot. I hope, with time, this will be a quicker process as I learn to <br/>\nrecognize old recordings and replace them with reasoning. My initial <br/>\nresponse when I&#39;m unsure tends to be cautious, as I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nsay &quot;yes&quot; and then later reconsider and say &quot;no&quot; to the same request. <br/>\nThat inconsistency  seems worse than changing an initial &quot;no&quot; to <br/>\na &quot;yes&quot; after I think through the issue and decide that its OK. But, <br/>\nas I reread this, the &quot;say no first&quot; option sounds a lot like <br/>\ntraditional parenting/leadership: start tough then ease the <br/>\nrestrictions. Maybe, since both options end with me being <br/>\ninconsistent, it is better to say &quot;yes&quot; first and stop the activity <br/>\nif it appears risky. Aaaahhhhh! Maybe I&#39;m overanalyzing....<br/>\n<br/>\nThe current hot issue is the boys&#39; (6 & 7) desire to shoot toy dart <br/>\nguns whenever they want, without need for parental supervision. DH <br/>\nworries because they currently lack the hand strength to operate the <br/>\ngun smoothly, which results in a certain amount of waving around <br/>\nwhile trying to cock the gun. This waving around could result in one <br/>\nboy shooting the other by accident. DH has great concern about eye <br/>\ndamage. The darts are a NERF variety - 2-3&quot; long, foam tube, with <br/>\nrubber suction cup tip.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK... with echoes of &quot;You&#39;ll shoot your eye out&quot; reverberating in my <br/>\nhead, I need advice/opinions on how you all handle risk assessment <br/>\nfor new activities like this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!
