She often wasn&#39;t really interested in the specific item, just wanted something or someone to play with. If it was the specific item I would ask Simon when he was going to be done with it, and Linnaea and I would do something else while waiting. At 2 it was fairly easy to find other things to do. If it happens now, when they are 11 and 8 it is less easy to find something else to distract their focus. So, for example, if they both want to watch a different television show that is on at the same time, it may some doing. Often the show is on an hour later on +1 channel, and a couple of channels in the UK have on-line viewing as well, so those are some options I can quickly explore. Sometimes Simon or Linnaea will have seen the show before and willrelease the television to the other one without any real angst. Sometimes I can&#39;t come up with a solution<br/>\n and there is disappointment and anger. Sometimes the solution doesn&#39;t matter, it is the thing, the control, the whatever that was important. The key, for me, is being present, making sure that it doesn&#39;t spiral up and out, and not getting angry or frustrated or invested in fixing it myself. As soon as my emotion and energy becomes a part of the mix, it gets explosive. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n=====================<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a five year old daughter and a two and a half year old son.

Kids don&#39;t start life with a whole lot of empathy. <br/>\nIts something that grows with time, and like anything else with kids <br/>\nthe hows and whens are going to be somewhat variable and not always <br/>\nlook the way you expect it to. Empathy also waxes and wanes a bit <br/>\ndepending on how well a child&#39;s needs are being met overall. So if <br/>\nyour dd is having a rough day, she&#39;s going to have less energy left <br/>\nover for empathy toward her bro. That&#39;s true for moms, too!

Try not to get <br/>\nwrapped up in things like housekeeping or projects when they are <br/>\nplaying close together. You *see* so much more when you&#39;re right <br/>\nthere and its easier to see trouble coming and so head it off. If <br/>\nyou need &quot;something to do&quot; get a magazine or really simple hand-<br/>\nwork. Something that doesn&#39;t take a huge amount of attention and <br/>\nthat you can drop at a moment&#39;s notice. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They get along well a lot of the time...it&#39;s that 10% that&#39;s got <br/>\n&gt; me stumped.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only 10%?????
