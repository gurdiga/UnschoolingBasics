I just finished reading &quot;Emergency<br/>\nChild Birth&quot; and it was very informative and reassuring.  It covers<br/>\nsome of the things you mentioned, and I will look up the rest,<br/>\nespecially the Gaskin Maneuver (in case it is different than what is<br/>\ndescribed in the book - for me, more options is better).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Chris<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, singdoula@... wrote:    <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I love the idea of an unassisted!
