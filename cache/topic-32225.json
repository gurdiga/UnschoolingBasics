Today he was talking to<br/>\n  one of the other boys about watching television and was shocked to<br/>\n  find out that this little boy isn&#39;t allowed to watch television except<br/>\n  for watching videos on Friday nights. He is also limited on computer<br/>\n  and video game time. Jack thought that was such a foreign concept<br/>\n  and was even further confused when the mother said &quot;normally he gets<br/>\n  to use the computer for an hour a day but he lost his computer time<br/>\n  this week for having a potty mouth&quot; Later he asked me what<br/>\n  grounded meant and why other kids get grounded. Now mind you most of<br/>\n  these parents are very young and have very young children and I<br/>\n  suppose just haven&#39;t gotten a clue yet. I made the comment that we<br/>\n  didn&#39;t limit tv, video games or computer time and the other parents<br/>\n  were shocked. We have had other conversations about not having<br/>\n  bedtimes and limits on other things so they pretty much think I am a<br/>\n  nut! Ok and the fact that my child pulled a wagon to the top of the<br/>\n  hill in the backyard and rode it down while the other kids were eating<br/>\n  snack like they hadn&#39;t been fed in days (another limit they all put on<br/>\n  their kids! UGH!) By the end all of the kids rode the wagon down<br/>\n  while each parent tried to stop them by telling them they would<br/>\n  probably crash and get hurt! Since Jack is my youngest I think they<br/>\n  all think I have just &quot;given up&quot; yet they always comment on how<br/>\n  pleasant he is and he&#39;s never a problem. Oh and I won&#39;t even get<br/>\n  into the consequences I saw being doled out when one boy threw a ball<br/>\n  inside the house and broke two small vases that were on a shelf (the<br/>\n  hostess immediately told the mom it wasn&#39;t a big deal the vases were<br/>\n  inexpensive trinkets from Ikea and not to worry!) I really think the<br/>\n  mom was embarrassed more than angry..I never have figured that one<br/>\n  out... kids are kids and everyone makes mistakes so why should it<br/>\n  reflect on you as a parent if something happens like that? I would<br/>\n  apologize, offer to replace the broken item or compensate them if the<br/>\n  item wasn&#39;t easily replaced and that would just be it (hopefully the<br/>\n  injured party would be gracious!) <br/>\n  We have also had play dates canceled because someone was grounded or<br/>\n  in trouble and it&#39;s always last minute... I just can&#39;t figure out why<br/>\n  they don&#39;t understand they are not just punishing their child but mine<br/>\n  who didn&#39;t do anything!<br/>\n  Lisa B <br/>\n<br/>\n  -<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  No virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\n  Checked by AVG. <br/>\n  Version: 7.5.524 / Virus Database: 269.23.6/1403 - Release Date: 4/29/2008 7:26 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re:Other kids getting punished","postDate":"1209517051","msgId":32267,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ2OGc1cis1bHE2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1Mzk1NzJFQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":32262,"nextInTopic":32274,"prevInTime":32266,"nextInTime":32268,"topicId":32225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... and ...

Today he was talking to<br/>\none of the other boys about watching television and was shocked to<br/>\nfind out that this little boy isn&#39;t allowed to watch television except<br/>\nfor watching videos on Friday nights.   He is also limited on computer<br/>\nand video game time.   Jack thought that was such a foreign concept<br/>\nand was even further confused when the mother said &quot;normally he gets<br/>\nto use the computer for an hour a day but he lost his computer time<br/>\nthis week for having a potty mouth&quot;     Later he asked me what<br/>\ngrounded meant and why other kids get grounded.   Now mind you most of<br/>\nthese parents are very young and have very young children and I<br/>\nsuppose just haven&#39;t gotten a clue yet.    I made the comment that we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t limit tv, video games or computer time and the other parents<br/>\nwere shocked.   We have had other conversations about not having<br/>\nbedtimes and limits on other things so they pretty much think I am a<br/>\nnut!   Ok and the fact that my child pulled a wagon to the top of the<br/>\nhill in the backyard and rode it down while the other kids were eating<br/>\nsnack like they hadn&#39;t been fed in days (another limit they all put on<br/>\ntheir kids! UGH!)  By the end all of the kids rode the wagon down<br/>\nwhile each parent tried to stop them by telling them they would<br/>\nprobably crash and get hurt!    Since Jack is my youngest I think they<br/>\nall think I have just &quot;given up&quot;  yet they always comment on how<br/>\npleasant he is and he&#39;s never a problem.   Oh and I won&#39;t even get<br/>\ninto the consequences I saw being doled out when one boy threw a ball<br/>\ninside the house and broke two small vases that were on a shelf (the<br/>\nhostess immediately told the mom it wasn&#39;t a big deal the vases were<br/>\ninexpensive trinkets from Ikea and not to worry!)  I really think the<br/>\nmom was embarrassed more than angry..I never have figured that one<br/>\nout... kids are kids and everyone makes mistakes so why should it<br/>\nreflect on you as a parent if something happens like that?   I would<br/>\napologize, offer to replace the broken item or compensate them if the<br/>\nitem wasn&#39;t easily replaced and that would just be it (hopefully the<br/>\ninjured party would be gracious!)   <br/>\nWe have also had play dates canceled because someone was grounded or<br/>\nin trouble and it&#39;s always last minute...

He couldn&#39;t quite understand why someone would give a<br/>\nkid a Gameboy and then not let them use it. We&#39;d talk it through,<br/>\nvalidate his feelings, and now - at almost 10 - he actually feels a bit<br/>\nsorry for kids who are forced to do or not do things, all the rules,<br/>\nregulations, chores, schoolwork/homework, etc. That&#39;s why we call him<br/>\nour &quot;Free Radical&quot; - he thinks all kids should be set free to grow, and<br/>\nexplore, and live life.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
