You have a 4 y.o., a 1.5 year old and are pretty close to giving birth, if you haven&#39;t already.  Be gentle with yourself, Mama!  You have so many demands placed on you by having several young children, and I am guessing you are suffering from sleep deprivation as well.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what a &quot;good&quot; unschooling parent&#39;s day looks like, but I feel like the most important thing with any kind of parenting is that you are mentally present with your children as much as possible.  I personally think this is hard, esp. when you don&#39;t get time to &quot;sharpen the axe&quot; (which you just don&#39;t when they are young).  I am working on this with myself, finding ways to meditate here and there, so that I am ready for the next interaction.  There is some quote-- I don&#39;t know if I read that Ren said it or Sandra Dodd or??  I can&#39;t remember.  But, it was something along the lines of, just focus on making the next interaction with your child better.  I find that helpful, just take it one little step at a time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMany blessings for a wonderful birth!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Elena<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;enajybbil&quot; &lt;enajybbil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\nRight now I&#39;m ABSOLUTELY NOT a good candidate for unschooling my children.

His books have been very inspiring for both my husband and I. <br/>\nIt has been a challenge for us both since we have a newborn and we both work part-time jobs. <br/>\n<br/>\nThings we do to fill in our time have been mainy weekly library trips. We go for story hour and then check out books after. My son loves having his own library card. This has also inspired him to read + write etc. We also enjoy the Science Museum (they have lots of free kids events)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are also signing up for swimming lessons as well different activities I have found about town, including karate, soccer, lego building for little engineers. We go to a monthly free day at a movie theater, also children&#39;s playhouse theatre. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe happen to live in Miami so we spend time at the beach building sand sculptures, writing our names in the sand, collecting shells. Mateo spends a lot of time drawing, writing words that he sees around, we make roads for his cars etc. Anything you do can become an adventure, the grocery store (colors, shapes, counting etc), cooking (measuring), cleaning up , gardening (following bugs around)etc.<br/>\nI recommend getting a couple kids activities to inspire some ideas. We have the Preschoolers Busy Book, and some other art and crafts books.<br/>\nMaybe you can go to the craft stores and have your children pick out things they like (glitters, shapes , stickers, paper, paints, stamps, etc) - to create things. Let your children direct and you&#39;ll find infinite possiblities!!! They are full of ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope all goes well...

As a single female parent of a 7 year old boy, I had to unlearn some of my own pacifist prejudices:) We have some really close adult male friends who used to play rough with him and while I appreciated that he had key male figures that he could connect with, it took me some time and trust to let go of my fears. And he loved those guys and even after we moved out of town, he is still pretty close to them and talks to them regularly, and we try to make sure that they get to see him at least every few months.<br/>\n <br/>\nSimilarly, he loves bollywood type of superhero movies (in Tamil, my language) and sometimes the makebelieve violence (fighting/hitting the bad guys etc.) would be R rated in the US. I was torn between giving him an opportunity to hear our language, see movies filled with people who looked like us, and exposing him to &#39;violence&#39;. But once I asked him when he was 4 or 5 if he understands that hero is not really beating people up. He said, &quot;Mom, I know that it is pretend to make it fun for us to watch&quot;. It seems that contrary to what people generally believe, kids know the difference between fantasy and reality, it was me who was getting confused!  He is a very sensitive, caring, and considerate young man who is emotionally very savvy and can process complex emotions related to family spread all around the world, multiple homes etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nI also agree that our society here glorifies violence at one level but is very prejudiced against boys and their kind of play. Even last week when we were at our local library and he wanted to play on a Star Wars game, the librarian (who he knows and loves) walked up to him and said that he was not allowed to play violent games. But her reasoning seemed okay to me - she said that because there are other very young children in the area and it may disturb them. But even to call it a &#39;violent&#39; game! And as I was sitting there and listening to this exchange, I realized how easily four/five years ago, I would have easily said the same of these games. <br/>\n <br/>\nLatha<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Sat, 9/5/09, Karen Swanay &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:luvbullbreeds@...\">luvbullbreeds@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Karen Swanay &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:luvbullbreeds@...\">luvbullbreeds@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: When your child is quizzed<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Saturday, September 5, 2009, 10:19 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just going to echo what the others are saying, I have two boys that are<br/>\n23 months apart in age, so each party, (birthdays etc) were total<br/>\nBoy-Fests.

If you want to give your son the big wide world then you should get used to the idea that the big wide world is full of people who think differently than you.  That&#39;s the world your son will live in.  Don&#39;t start out by making him think he can only associate with people exactly like him.

If Jonah was from a different school the dad would have asked him those questions.  That&#39;s how adults talk to kids.

It&#39;s as much about them and their child as it is about you and yours.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGet to know the parents.  Invite them over for cake and coffee.  Take them a plate of cookies.  Share some of your garden produce, (the zucchini fairy has visited me twice, she must have forgotten I planted some myself.)   or some flowers.   Tell them something sweet about their own kid and how nice it is for Jonah to have made a friend already.  Show them your a normal person and they won&#39;t have anything to be suspicious about.  They won&#39;t have so many questions for Jonah. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t start from a place of fear every morning.

Perhaps they are starting to look outside the box themselves, you never know you could be the one who may open a new way of thinking for them, if you allow your motherly defences to be at peace - and I know I have those in abundance too.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust another viewpoint, hope it works out for your son.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,  Camille<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Jacquie Krauskopf <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, September 05, 2009 8:27 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] When your child is quizzed<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    We moved from small town Avilla to bigger Fort Wayne and the first kids we met- boys and both close to Jonah&#39;s age to play with.

Unschooling is perfectly legal and is done in every state.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf i were you, I might call the other parents or even when the boys were playing and ask them about it.  &quot;Jonah says you were interested in his homeschooling.  Is there any questions I can answer for you that he may not have?&quot;  Or something of the sort.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to live in fear.  I also don&#39;t think all people who ask pointed questions are necessarily out to get you. Remember that homeschooling and especially unschooling is a very unfamiliar topic in most households.

You may find you&#39;re rusty in that department - many parents do. You might also look into getting some &quot;rainy day activity&quot; books, or look on the internet for fun games and crafts for younger children. Think about the sorts of things your children like to do and offer more, and variations on those themes. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of all, get down on the floor and be where your children are. Savor their childhood. Enjoy their happiness and interests. That&#39;s the core of unschooling, and really the core of good parenting - cherishing your children in a very day by day, moment by moment way, rather than from a distance. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be posting a blog carnival tonight or tomorrow, and that will give you a place to start reading some unschoolers&#39; blogs, too. In the meantime, have you been to Sandra&#39;s site? I&#39;m sorry my links are wonky today, but if you can go there and click on Strewing you&#39;ll find lots of suggestions for things to do with kids of all ages. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":241207513,"authorName":"Jacquie Krauskopf","from":"Jacquie Krauskopf &lt;home_maker97@...&gt;","profile":"home_maker97","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"When your child is quizzed","postDate":"1252096060","msgId":41242,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc2NTg3OS45NjYzOC5xbUB3ZWIzOTUwMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGg3cmE3Zysxc2RrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg3cmE3Zysxc2RrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41239,"nextInTopic":41243,"prevInTime":41241,"nextInTime":41243,"topicId":41239,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We moved from small town Avilla to bigger Fort Wayne and the first kids we met- boys and both close to Jonah s age to play with.

In the little town we were both raised in the homeschoolers were a weird bunch. They didn&#39;t see sunlight very often. I want to show my husband that unschooling will be the best life for our children (4yo, 1.5yo and due on 9/27). Up until a year ago I haven&#39;t been the most attentive of mothers. I&#39;ve recently stumbled onto attachment parenting blogs, magazines, and a new way of viewing motherhood. SO the question is: How do I &quot;practice&quot; unschooling right now? How do I engage my son (the 4yo) in ways that I have not? Assume that I have been the typical lazy mother with lots of TV watching, not playing with my kids, all that bad stuff. Right now I&#39;m ABSOLUTELY NOT a good candidate for unschooling my children. I&#39;m lazy and unimaginative. What does a a good unschooling parent&#39;s day look like?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41599,"nextTopicId":41679}}
