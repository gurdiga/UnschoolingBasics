Create some other play for him and Grandma that doesn&#39;t make him want to take his clothes off.  A sandbox, or a gravel pile in the corner of the yard.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you divide his outside play area and sister&#39;s play area somehow - sheets across a clothes line?   Can you enclose his mud/water play place in one of those portable gazebo tents? <br/>\n<br/>\nWould he move the naked play inside to the bathtub and save it for times Grandma&#39;s not there? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a clothing optional society, not without problems or special arrangement, anyway.  You can talk about that without attaching shame to body parts.  Clothing helps people feel more protected from the spread of germs, protects tender skin, etc.   Public nudity is illegal.  He might be too young to understand that but you can talk about it.  People don&#39;t mind so much when kids are little but when people *start* minding then it&#39;s time to cover up in public. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":234185411,"authorName":"Bekki Kirby","from":"Bekki Kirby &lt;junegoddess@...&gt;","profile":"bekkijune","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Differing opinions about nudity","postDate":"1257085812","msgId":41992,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMyNzI3NmNjMDkxMTAxMDYzMG4zNDMwNjljMXAxODY3MWJkZmU5ZDczN2JkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhjaTE4MCs3OWhlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGMyNzI3NmNjMDkxMDMxMDk0N3g3YmY3MWM2bjRhZTg5OWIzOTU5ZjUyMkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JIDxoY2kxODArNzloZUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":41991,"nextInTopic":41993,"prevInTime":41991,"nextInTime":41993,"topicId":41988,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
