This is all stuff that she likes to mix together just <br/>\nto see what happens.  She was enormously pleased with herself, for <br/>\nexample, the day that she discovered that oil and colored water in her <br/>\ntest tube would make something sort of like a wave bottle, or a lava <br/>\nlamp.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has a large supply of plastic test tubes and plastic pipettes and <br/>\ntest tube stands and some recycled glass and plastic jars to mix and <br/>\nplay in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn DD&#39;s science &quot;kit&quot; she has little baby food jars filled with things <br/>\nfrom the house and kitchen: sand, cornmeal, flour, cornstarch, baking <br/>\nsoda, baking powder (fizzes in water, since it has a dry acid already <br/>\nin it), vinegar, antacids (she is past the stage of eating things like <br/>\nthis), vitamin C, fruit fresh (a combination of dry acids), cocoa, <br/>\nsugar, salt, rock salt, oil in different colors (i.e. xvirgin olive oil <br/>\nis greenish, canola more yellow, etc.), rubbing alcohol, coarse <br/>\nglitter, fine glitter, borax solution, glue, tub tints (little dry <br/>\npellets of color sold for use in playing in the bathtub), liquid <br/>\nwatercolors, and probably some other things I&#39;m not thinking of.  Oh, <br/>\nyeah, some packets of dry cool-aid in different colors.  I&#39;m thinking <br/>\nof getting different colors of lamp oil, but haven&#39;t yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has little baby food jars filled with other things purchased from a <br/>\nkid&#39;s science supply house: fake snow (superabsorbent polymer), the <br/>\nkind of superabsorbant powder that they put into baby diapers,  a kind <br/>\nof superabsorbant powder that turns into little gelly &quot;crystals,&quot;  glow <br/>\n- in - the dark powder, magic sand (stays dry in water).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also has kid-sized plastic eye protectors that she wears for the <br/>\ndress-up pretend factor of being a chemist when she plays with her <br/>\nstuff.  I am planning to make her a kid-sized lab coat with her name on <br/>\nthe pocket, but haven&#39;t done it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, she just likes to play around and see what happens -- but <br/>\nhere are a few combinations that definitely &quot;do&quot; something:  slime <br/>\n(borax solution and glue), fizzy bath bombs (oil, baking soda, and <br/>\nKool-aid mixed together and formed into a small ball - fizzes and <br/>\nreleases oil and sent when dropped into a bath); cornstarch and water <br/>\nturns into a weird substance that seems liquid until you push on it and <br/>\nthen it seems solid.  If you put plain whole milk in a shallow saucer <br/>\nand drop little bits of watercolor or foodcolor in, the colors will <br/>\nmostly stay in place -- touch the center with a toothpick dipped in <br/>\ndishwashing liquid and the colors will instantly begin to mix and <br/>\nswirl.<br/>\n<br/>\nI second someone&#39;s suggestion of the Kampf experiment of the week -- <br/>\nit&#39;s great.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe get some of our stuff from www.stevesspanglerscience.com.  Lydia <br/>\nsometimes likes to keep her concotions in test tubes, rather than <br/>\nrinsing them out to start over, so we get them in bulk - they&#39;re about <br/>\n40cents each, when you buy them 120 at at time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope some of this is helpful.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"soggyboysmom","from":"&quot;soggyboysmom&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Exploring &quot;Science&quot; and Experiments","postDate":"1118155408","msgId":5589,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ4NGJxZytoZ281QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGQ4NDhtNStqNTFrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5588,"nextInTopic":5591,"prevInTime":5588,"nextInTime":5590,"topicId":5588,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
