When my now 3 year old was 1, I got pregnant<br/>\nagain, and although I nursed all through my pregnancy<br/>\nand am currently still tandem nursing there have been<br/>\n(and still are) several times that I really don&#39;t feel<br/>\nlike nursing my 3 year old.  This has been a struggle<br/>\n(largely mentally) because I have always nursed on<br/>\ndemand.  Then my nipples started to hurt, and I&#39;d<br/>\nalways try to let the baby have priority when it came<br/>\nto nursing, and I didn&#39;t always want to nurse them<br/>\nboth at the same time.  Anyhow, I am still finding the<br/>\ncomfortable balance.  One thing that I found helpful<br/>\nto say when there was a time I did not want to nurse<br/>\nmy 3 year old was to let him know *when the next time<br/>\nwould be that he could nurse*.  He usually seems ok<br/>\nand satisfied by this.  Because if I would just say<br/>\nno, not right now, he may freak out and think he would<br/>\nnever get to nurse again.  But if I say something<br/>\nlike, not right now how about after we eat breakfast?<br/>\nthat really helps!  Being honest seems key to me. <br/>\nAnother example, letting him know if one of my nipples<br/>\nis sore- he&#39;s very understanding about that and will<br/>\neven point that out.<br/>\n<br/>\nA recent book that came out a couple months after my<br/>\nsecond son, now 1, was born: Adventures in Tandem<br/>\nNursing by Hillary Flowers is very insightful. <br/>\nPerhaps some of this will help your situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jennefer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n_______________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nWin 1 of 4,000 free domain names from Yahoo!
