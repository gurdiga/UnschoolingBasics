It is hoped that attendees will actively support other individuals and organizations through a process of transparency whereby best practices can be shared and the viability of educating without compulsory schools will be firmly entrenched and legitimized. Organizations are encouraged to bring brochures as well as flyers about their upcoming events for distribution. Everyone is encouraged to network.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHope to see you there!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nBrooke<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.humaneschooling.org</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49790,"nextTopicId":49775}}
