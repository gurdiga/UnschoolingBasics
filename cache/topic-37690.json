Who sent it ???<br/>\nHow did the person know that it what my kids wanted?<br/>\nTo you our fairly godmother or godfather:<br/>\nThank you from the bottom of my heart. My kids truely loved it and <br/>\ncan&#39;t stop running around.<br/>\nI am touched by your kindness and generosity.<br/>\nI will blog later with pictures of the pez and the kids. The candy will <br/>\nbe half way gone by then I believe.<br/>\nWhat a beautiful day.
