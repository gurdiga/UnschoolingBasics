Here in Florida, it is much easier, thank God. <br/>\n  Have you thought about doing an eclectic style of homeschooling, in order to be able to follow the guidelines you have posted? That would mean, you do some workbook ( I know everyone is shivering in disgust at me now), the once that the children enjoy - for example my daughter loves to write out information on a variety of animals that she comes across, and absolutely loves at times to go through a Spanish workbook, that I have readily available, and sometimes math, but the point is, that she chooses to use them as she pleases, reads as she likes (and I keep a log of what she reads, for our portfolio), also I keep track of the time she spends on the computer on an educational site, such as an architectural site she just discovered. <br/>\n  For other things, such as outdoor experiences, I take pictures, and write some comments to it and add that to our map. The problem is though, that it really depends on the people that do the inspections how this is going to work best for you. Are they open to unschoolers, or are they narrow minded people, that do not even like the strict -by -the -book homeschoolers? <br/>\n  You could also look into so -called umbrella schools. Try to find one, that keeps records for unschoolers, they should know more about how to handle officials in the state you life in. But they do charge a fee for their services, at least I have not heard of a free one yet. If anyone out there knows one, I would love to pass this information along to any of my clients.<br/>\n  Hope this helped a little.  <br/>\n  You, and your family are in my prayers.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Have a blessed day.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Rev.
