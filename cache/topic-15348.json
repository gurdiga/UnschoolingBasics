I<br/>\ncan talk with them about it but I will not be able to heal the damage. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the same with experiences... I will (after I woke up after a painfull<br/>\nsituation with Jesse) never allow my children to step into dangerous<br/>\nsituations which they are simply not able to see for what it is. <br/>\n<br/>\nTelevision itself is not dangerous or damaging but a lot of programmes are,<br/>\nin my opinion, to the brains and hearts of my shining children. They are too<br/>\nyoung to cope with violence, war and so on. And because I don&#39;t know what<br/>\nthe people of the programmes are going to do (I have to watch it before I<br/>\nknow but than it happened already) I talk to Jesse (just turned 7) and I<br/>\ntell him that I protect him and don&#39;t allow him to watch this crap, the same<br/>\nas I don&#39;t allow him to drive my car, as he certainly wishes. <br/>\nI can see Jesse and Tygo reacting the same when violence comes on the<br/>\nscreen. And violence can come on the screen every second. They watch it and<br/>\nare not able to walk away... Tygo is not able to tell me (2,5 years) what he<br/>\nis feeling but Jesse tells me that he is paralyzed when he sees children aho<br/>\nfight or calling each other names, when there is an operation of whatever on<br/>\nthe screen. So I have two choices: I watch everything with them, interfering<br/>\nwhen I see that it is upsetting them... or I leave them alone with the<br/>\nmachine which turns out to be very scary to them.. Or I talk with Jesse and<br/>\ncome to the conclusion that this is not what we want to live in this house.<br/>\nTelevision is hypnotizing to my children and they are not able to runaway<br/>\nfrom it.<br/>\nSo I protect them from it.. with the permission of Jesse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey watch videos as much as they want and that is it. No television in this<br/>\nhouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nA different view.. I think it will all change when they are older and much<br/>\nmore able to see what is going on...

When my 1st ds was about 3, he would watch the same movie over and <br/>\nover again.  He still does it now for new movies, and then he learns all <br/>\nthe lines from the movie ~ lol.  Obviously she&#39;s not watching TV every <br/>\nwaking hour or she wouldn&#39;t be doing pretend play.  Our TV is on all the <br/>\ntime, and our kids (almost 5 and 19mo) move from room to room playing.  <br/>\nSometimes they&#39;ll come in and sit down and watch something, and other <br/>\ntimes they won&#39;t.  Right now my 5yo is watching something and my 19mo is <br/>\ndigging in the toy box pulling out toys.  We&#39;ve never restricted TV with <br/>\nthem.  My DH works in TV, so it&#39;s a very big part of our lives and <br/>\nalways has been.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m a bit confused about your comment about your dd watching TV <br/>\naround the baby?  What problem do you see with that?  Your dd will be of <br/>\nthe age to totally understand about babies and the need to be gentle <br/>\nwith them.  There are 3.5yrs between my two, and my son totally <br/>\nunderstood about being gentle and easy with the baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristie<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty Felner wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~snipped~<br/>\n&gt; I DD is really into movies, and any new movie she sees<br/>\n&gt; becomes a new &quot;addiction&quot;.

I was a huge anti-tv person before I<br/>\nstarted moving more towards RU.  I gave my dd2.7 control over her tv<br/>\nwatching maybe 3 months ago or so.  (It seems like it&#39;s been forever, but I<br/>\nknow it was a little while after the new year.)  Like your son, dd is glued<br/>\nto the tv.  I keep thinking of how I&#39;d read comments like what Vijay said<br/>\nabout give it time they&#39;ll be less interested, etc.  So far for me that<br/>\nhasn&#39;t happened.  DD is really into movies, and any new movie she sees<br/>\nbecomes a new &quot;addiction&quot;.  That being said,  I also agree with what Vijay<br/>\nsaid about them soaking up plots, characters etc.  It is very evident in dd<br/>\nimaginary play.  She is constantly pretending her stuffed animals are the<br/>\nvarious characters from the movies and acts out different scenes.  This is<br/>\none of the few things keeping me from turning off the tv and saying, I think<br/>\nyou&#39;ve watched enough.  That and of course my continuous push to move more<br/>\ntowards RU.  We are planning on trying for a second soon and I&#39;m concerned<br/>\nabout her watching tv with the baby around.  I think your idea for having a<br/>\ncabinet to close off the tv might help the way you think it will.  We don&#39;t<br/>\nhave a cabinet cover either, and I think that&#39;s part of why she watches so<br/>\nmuch.  Whenever we&#39;re somewhere else and the tv isn&#39;t visible she&#39;s not<br/>\ninterested in it.  Also, I&#39;ve found anytime she sits on the couch it&#39;s like<br/>\na memory cue  Hope this helps some how.
