If you ask him, <br/>\nhe&#39;ll say I taught him, but I didn&#39;t really.  I just talked him through it <br/>\neverytime I tied his shoes for him.  He watched and listened and went on his way. <br/>\n One day he tried it and talked his way through it like I did and he got it!  <br/>\nI&#39;d say, cross them over and pull one through and pull it tight.  Make a <br/>\nbunny ear, wrap the other around your fingers and pinch it between your finger and <br/>\nthumb and then poke it through with your finger.  Then pull it tight.  all <br/>\nwhile going through the motions.  It worked for him without him feeling like he <br/>\nhad to tie them or that he should feel bad for not learning yet.  He also <br/>\ntaught himself to ride a two wheel bike in a day (without training wheels ever).  <br/>\nI feel like he was just ready to do both so he did.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBeth <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1289,"nextTopicId":1261}}
