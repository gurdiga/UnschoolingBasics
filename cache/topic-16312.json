I think a good guideline to <br/>\nuse is to think of how you would treat another adult.  If you dh (or friend) <br/>\nhelped you, you would likely say &quot;thank you&quot;.  It would sound really funny if <br/>\none said &quot;good boy, husband, for helping me!&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if anyone posted this article, yet, but it is great: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alfiekohn.org/parenting/gj.htm\">http://www.alfiekohn.org/parenting/gj.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAlfie Kohn says that being enthusiastic is fine.  Giving praise as a <br/>\nSkinnerian behavior modification tool is not OK.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaying &quot;thank you&quot; is a great way to model.  You will probably hear me say <br/>\nagain and again that one does not have to &quot;train&quot; or &quot;teach&quot; a child to say <br/>\n&quot;sorry&quot;, &quot;thank you&quot;, or &quot;please&quot;.  If it is modeled, they pick it up just like <br/>\nanything else.  I thought this was fascinating when I read it when my ds was <br/>\npreverbal.  I tried it (never, ever asked him to say please, thank you or sorry). <br/>\n Now, at 3 years, he says it more than most adults I know!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thought on this subject:  many of us are praise junkies!  So, we <br/>\nlove to hear &quot;great job&quot;.  If we had been raised with having someone say &quot;Thank <br/>\nyou for helping.  I like how clean the kitchen smells/look&quot;  (ie putting it in <br/>\n&quot;I&quot; terms, and how it makes us feel, rather than making a judgment like &quot;you <br/>\nare helpful&quot;), we would be less likely to need the praise.  We would be more <br/>\nlikely to be intrinsically motivated (it makes us feel good to make some one <br/>\nfeel good) rather than extrinsically motivated (we better do it or we will be <br/>\nshamed; or lets do it to hear someone else tell what a good person we are).  <br/>\nWith intrinsic motivation, one learns to feel good about themselves, regardless <br/>\nof what others think.  Children are born with the desire to please.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink that we should take advantage of it.  I think we should just let it <br/>\nblossom on its own with enthusiam, and sincere appreciation.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nCynthia <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Too much praise!!

It does help kids to get sincere feedback of all kinds.<br/>\nFeedback helps us learn. Yeah, too much praise can be...well, too<br/>\nmuch. But if it&#39;s geniune, then GREAT! <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes they need to hear what ISN&#39;T working too. A genuine &quot;It&#39;s<br/>\nNOT ok to shove her when you&#39;re mad, let&#39;s go take a walk&quot; or &quot;Use<br/>\nyour words&quot; or whatever that child needs at the moment to help them<br/>\nnavigate is useful information.  Yep, I think feedback is useful for<br/>\nthe most part. And it sounds like you&#39;re aware of using more<br/>\ndescriptive phrases, than general. It also sounds like you&#39;re aware<br/>\nthat it might be too much sometimes....so maybe just reflect WITH the<br/>\nchild some? <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times when my children show me something with pride and I<br/>\nsimply say &quot;you&#39;re REALLY happy about that, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br/>\nDepends on the kid, depends on the situation. But I&#39;ve found that<br/>\ngiving them ownership of the happy/proud feeling is just as useful as<br/>\nsaying &quot;wow, look at all those colors!&quot; (in relation to a drawing).<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16321,"nextTopicId":16317}}
