Someone in my family (who is 100% behind us in<br/>\nunschooling!) has been accused by someone else in my family. I 100% believe<br/>\nthe accusations to be false as far as this person is concerned but don&#39;t<br/>\nreally know where to turn to get help for the person accused who is somewhat<br/>\nvulnerable. The family in question lives in Maine if anyone has any state<br/>\nspecific information that could be of help. I am in NJ and having a hard<br/>\ntime locating resources that might be helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n(yes the person accused is in the process of finding legal counsel. any<br/>\nideas on determining qualified/not qualified on the part of the attorney<br/>\nwould be helpful as well)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone knows of any information on exposing false allegations that would<br/>\nbe helpful too!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nLisaR -zzz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33634,"nextTopicId":33533}}
