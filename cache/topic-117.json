I am hoping that someone might have a recommendation for <br/>\nme.  My dd would really like a butterfly net and a cool creature <br/>\nkeeper/something to keep bugs in for a while to watch them.  You all <br/>\nmight remember that I&#39;m in Turkey, and the store we have here on <br/>\nbase doesn&#39;t have much of anything!  I did a little searching <br/>\nonline, but I didn&#39;t find anything good.  There are just too many <br/>\nhomeschool supply sites to wade through, and I thought someone may <br/>\nhave a quick recommendation of a source that they&#39;ve used before.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we would like to find some kind of yard activities, like those <br/>\nballs with paddles or little hand net/ball games - something of that <br/>\nsort.  We&#39;ve been kind of bored lately and need some new <br/>\nentertainment!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would totally appreciate any help on this!
