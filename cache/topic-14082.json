My name is Lindsay and I&#39;m 29 and living in <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beautiful state of Oregon. I took my son Jackson (7) out of school <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about 4.5 months ago.  I have 3 other, very young children, Kylie <br/>\n&gt; 2 <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and 6 month old twins, Willow and Annabelle.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am struggling with the fact that due to the heavy load I must <br/>\n&gt; carry <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with such young children that Jackson most probably will be back <br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; school in the Fall.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We are looking at enrolling him in a spanish immersion school here <br/>\n&gt; in <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our town.  I&#39;m trying to seek the best place for him since being <br/>\n&gt; at <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; home isn&#39;t the best option -- for now at least.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jackson is a brilliant child with a ton of energy.  His mind is 50 <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his body is 7 (at least that is how it seems to me).  Even if he <br/>\n&gt; does <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; go to school in the fall, we are dedicated to living a radical <br/>\n&gt; life.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kind of like radical unschooling with a little school in the mix <br/>\n&gt; ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;m just looking for a place to get some of my thoughts <br/>\n&gt; out.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m hoping some who have been unschooling for awhile can share <br/>\n&gt; some <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wisdom.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lindsay<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":218449772,"authorName":"zenmomma@comcast.net","from":"zenmomma@...","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Trying to unschool........","postDate":"1149617842","msgId":14093,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA2MDYyMDA2MTgxNy4xMDQzMC40NDg1QzZCMjAwMDVFQkMxMDAwMDI4QkUyMjA3MzAwMDMzMEUwMzAzMDEwMzAyMEE5NkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":14092,"nextInTopic":14097,"prevInTime":14092,"nextInTime":14094,"topicId":14082,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Think about what you<br/>\nneed and want to do right now.  What are your priorities?  What needs to get<br/>\ndone today?  Obviously you have 2 wee ones that really need a lot of your<br/>\nattention.  What can  you do to help the older 2 be more self-sufficient?<br/>\nI&#39;m not talking about housework (forbid!) or taking themselves to the<br/>\nlibrary, but simple things like having foods and drinks accessible.  Cheese<br/>\nthat is already cut up or apples already sliced.  Graham crackers that are<br/>\nopen and put in an easy to reseal container (like those ziploc sandwich<br/>\nboxes that you just push to close).  If your 2 yo drinks from a sippy cup,<br/>\nwhat if she had several that were already made up ahead of time waiting for<br/>\nher in the fridge or on the counter?  A &quot;story basket&quot; set up beside<br/>\nwhatever chair you nurse your twins in?  Or (as I did with my last child) a<br/>\n&quot;video basket&quot; with videos that we could watch together while I sat down<br/>\nwith the baby (nursing or not - sometimes just to take a load off!)  Someone<br/>\npointed out to me not long ago that laundry takes 10 minutes to do.  5<br/>\nminutes to start a load and 5 minutes to &quot;flip&quot; a load.  I&#39;ve gotten to<br/>\nwhere I pile the laundry on my bed and found that 2 loads of laundry a day<br/>\ntakes about 5 minutes to fold - 10 if it&#39;s whites (why is that?  LOL!)  And<br/>\nsome things just dont&#39; need folding - underwear, dust or burp rags, and<br/>\ndiapers - not that I have those anymore - they&#39;re all dustrags LOL!)  I have<br/>\na basket in each bedroom and in each bathroom.  I ask people to aim towards<br/>\nthe baskets.  It has helped immensly with the laundry struggles!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour twins are 6 months old now, but at the end of the summer they are going<br/>\nto be 9 months old and by the end of the year 12 months old.  By this time<br/>\nnext year they are going to be busy little toddlers and you *will* have more<br/>\ntime (for yourself and your older children.)  What is the worst that could<br/>\nhappen if your son didn&#39;t go to school and didn&#39;t do any formal studies this<br/>\nyear?  You might surprise yourself to find that he will be immersed in his<br/>\npassions and living life joyfully ............ and so will you!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Trying to unschool........","postDate":"1149614437","msgId":14089,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJGQTJBNEM0LTE4OUMtNDlBMC04RUJDLUIxNTk0RjZERUMyQkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU2NDhyNStqaGU3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU2NDhyNStqaGU3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":14087,"nextInTopic":14090,"prevInTime":14088,"nextInTime":14090,"topicId":14082,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh Lindsay, that is really tough.

To earn badges and patches, they always have to do  <br/>\nsome kind of service.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option that I&#39;ve seen used, and it worked really really well,  <br/>\nis not to send the child to actual school, but just to sign him up  <br/>\nfor an after-school (daycare) program. These CAN (you have to check  <br/>\nthem out) be fun - with a lot of emphasis on games and activities and  <br/>\nprojects. Also, parks and recreation departments often have after- <br/>\nschool programs -- these tend to be a bit more casual, less  <br/>\nregimented, than the ones offered at the actual schools.  After- <br/>\nschool programs might run from 2 or 3 to 6 daily, that&#39;s 3 or 4 hours  <br/>\nof supervised playtime with other kids. Might not be your ideal  <br/>\nsituation, but I think it would be a lot better than actual classroom  <br/>\nschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 6, 2006, at 9:00 AM, lindsaylou97330 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; He hates the idea.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve even posted an <br/>\nintroduction yet, but I wanted to respond to your post because I can <br/>\nrelate so well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am 40 yrs old and the mother of five : Athena Grace-10, Jesse <br/>\nJosiah-10, Malachi Jaedon-3, Isaiah Elias-2, Xanna Joy-9months. Yes, <br/>\nthe older ones are twins. I started homeschooling when the twins <br/>\nwere 7 and I was pregnant with Malachi. I lost Malachi&#39;s twin during <br/>\nthat pregnancy and had alot of other complications. Malachi was born <br/>\nwith a cleft lip and a heart condition. When we were trying to get <br/>\npregnant again, my husband was afraid I&#39;d end up on bed rest again <br/>\nand wouldn&#39;t be able to homeschool both twins, so he sent my <br/>\ndaughter to public school. Worst mistake ever. She&#39;s a social <br/>\nbutterfly and just loved being surrounded by friends(Miss <br/>\nPopularity), but neglected to do any school work. I don&#39;t believe <br/>\nshe learned a thing in that year. So, we went back to homeschooling <br/>\nher. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been homeschooling for four years and it has been a constant <br/>\nstruggle finding out how to school the twins. I wish I had known <br/>\nabout unschooling when I started. It&#39;s hard to get out of <br/>\nthe &#39;schooling&#39; mentality. I&#39;m still not totally there. However, if <br/>\nyou take time to write down everything the kids are learning without <br/>\nbeing stuck at a table with books, it&#39;s amazing. My twins can run a <br/>\nhouse by themselves including grocery shopping(comparitive price <br/>\nshopping), cooking, changing babies, making formula, sterilizing <br/>\nbottles, doing laundry, planting gardens, mowing & weeding, etc. My <br/>\nhusband owns an ACE Hardware Store so they also have had experience <br/>\nwith on-the-job training, customer service, organization, manners, <br/>\ntime cards, phone skills, paychecks, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 10 yr old is very active (Sometimes down right wild) but he <br/>\ntaught himself to read at 4 yrs of age and is great at retaining <br/>\nwhat he&#39;s learned. He has a love for science, space, natural <br/>\ndisasters, weather, and history. Through videos, field trips, and <br/>\ngoogle searches, he has learned so much more that even I can <br/>\nremember from being in pulbic schools my whole life. <br/>\n<br/>\nI finally decided to stop giving weekly tests and just let the kids <br/>\nlearn. I was a straight A student in school and Valedictorian when I <br/>\ngraduated from high school. Went to college on a full scholarship. <br/>\nHowever, I don&#39;t remember anything they I was ever taught in school <br/>\nand none of what I was taught applies to the life I am living now. <br/>\nI&#39;d rather my kids follow their own interest and remember what <br/>\nthey&#39;ve learned.<br/>\n<br/>\nLindsay, having little ones around can be difficult at times. <br/>\nHowever, the 6 &7 year olds are very similar in age. Keeping tabs on <br/>\nthe 2 yr old may seem hard, but don&#39;t feel bad to allow him to watch <br/>\nsome educational tv while the older ones are involved in something <br/>\nelse. My 2&3 year old can both count to 10, recognize letters, <br/>\ncomplete puzzles, build with legos, role play, and even say some <br/>\nwords in spanish. They have learned to be independent and share. <br/>\nThere are plenty of activities available for them to do alone. If <br/>\nall else fails, incorporate your older kids in helping with the two <br/>\nyear old. If things get out of hand around here, I will have each of <br/>\nthe 10 yr olds take time with the toddler and baby. They will play <br/>\nwith them outside or read them books(a good way to enforce their own <br/>\nreading skills). Just having them one on one with the little ones <br/>\ncontrols the chaos.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I can say is hang in there Lindsay. There are days I think it <br/>\nwould be so nice to ship them off to school, but I feel so called to <br/>\nhave them at home I know I&#39;d really be miserable. Believe in the <br/>\nchoice you have made and believe in yourself. My husband doewsn&#39;t <br/>\nhelp out at home, but I have his support in my endeavors and that <br/>\nmeans the world to me. Find a support system. I&#39;m learning adn <br/>\nstruggling right along with you. Feel free to drop me an e-mail if <br/>\nyou ever need to talk or vent.<br/>\n<br/>\nLorraine           <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lindsaylou97330&quot; <br/>\n&lt;lindsay.baker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi All,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m new to this list.

In reality, looking back, I probably created *more*<br/>\nwork than less by having her in school.  I *had* to be up at 6am every<br/>\nmorning with her school uniform ready.  I *had* to have a lunch packed for<br/>\nher (she refused to eat school food).  I *had* to take her to school every<br/>\nmorning by 7:15 (7:15 for a baby to start sitting in class all day!) and<br/>\npick her up everyday at 2:30 (she went to a magnate program school and we<br/>\nlived outside of that district).

If I had only known how to let her enjoy living and trust<br/>\nthat she would learn the things she needed without school (which why I<br/>\nthought she needed school after she taught herself to read at age 4 - with<br/>\n*very little* help from me).

I have 3 other, very young children, Kylie 2 <br/>\nand 6 month old twins, Willow and Annabelle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am struggling with the fact that due to the heavy load I must carry <br/>\nwith such young children that Jackson most probably will be back to <br/>\nschool in the Fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are looking at enrolling him in a spanish immersion school here in <br/>\nour town.  I&#39;m trying to seek the best place for him since being at <br/>\nhome isn&#39;t the best option -- for now at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nJackson is a brilliant child with a ton of energy.  His mind is 50 and <br/>\nhis body is 7 (at least that is how it seems to me).  Even if he does <br/>\ngo to school in the fall, we are dedicated to living a radical life.  <br/>\nKind of like radical unschooling with a little school in the mix ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m just looking for a place to get some of my thoughts out.  <br/>\nI&#39;m hoping some who have been unschooling for awhile can share some <br/>\nwisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nLindsay</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14096,"nextTopicId":14091}}
