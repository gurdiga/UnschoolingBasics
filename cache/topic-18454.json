I show them stuff.<br/>\nI answer questions when asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether any teaching is done or not, the learning<br/>\nneeds to happen within the learner. A teacher can<br/>\nteach till cows come home and the child may still have<br/>\nlearned nothing. If I focus on teaching I&#39;m likely to<br/>\nlose sight of all the learning that happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Teaching is fine, within the parameters defined by<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the learner.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nFor most teaching, the teacher sets the agenda. If it<br/>\nwere not for the second half of that statement, I<br/>\nwould&#39;ve said &quot;No, teaching is not fine&quot;. So I don&#39;t<br/>\nsee anything that I do as teaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, my daughter goes for Taekwondo<br/>\nlessons and her teacher does teach taekwondo.<br/>\n<br/>\nManisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

Yes, teaching happens.<br/>\nBut when we really look at it being all within the learner, then<br/>\nteaching is irrelevant and learning is everything.
