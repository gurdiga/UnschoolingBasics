There will be some &#39;waste&#39; of food as they learn what they like and how to hear what their bodies need and can hold. But there is a real problem for me with too many changes: it&#39;s too much work. I find that as we are struggling our way toward real freedom for all of us (ds age 7, dd age 10, ds age 13, and me, the middle-aged, tired single parent) that it&#39;s too much work for me to make everything they think of to eat, help all of them with all the ideas they have, model generous cleanup of everything, empathize, play, and work!! No surprise there. Even as I describe it and remember joyful days I can also hear the resentment in my voice. I have had to give myself permission to be tired, to refuse even reasonable requests if I can not say yes without severe stress, to need a break. This is a hard journey for me. I forget to take care of myself and we all suffer. But I know I must model that I am worthy of care<br/>\n also, so sometimes I will reply to a changed food or activity request, &quot; I am not able to do that right now. Go ahead and (get something else to eat, not requiring my help/ get out that paint set, whatever). When I can help I will.&quot; They may pout which is hard on me.  I also have a hard time with fluid bedtimes, and here is why. As a single parent I used to get my much needed private time, to think, read, pay bills, meditate, pray, write, in the middle of the night or very early morning. Now my kids are choosing completely different schedules, so my 13 yo ds wants to stay up until 3:00 am and sleep until noon, while my 7 yo ds gets up at 7 or 8 after falling asleep in our family bed amongst the late-night family reading or video whenever he can. He is sleep deprived, I think but can not sleep late, never could. Then my dd, age 10 , says that the 13 yo gets &#39;private mom time&#39; with me at night and the 7 yo gets it in the morning. Her schedule of preference is to sleep from<br/>\n midnight to 10. She is never awake when the boys aren&#39;t around. And also a challenge: there are no more hours left to fulfill my needs for adult companionship or solitude.  So how do I balance this? How did I get from food to sleep...I guess because I haven&#39;t learned how to balance all this.

This afternoon, he asked for raisins and a peanut-butter apple. Ate the raisins, decided he didn&#39;t want the apple (already prepared, and pb apple doesn&#39;t look so appetizing if you save it for long) but asked for a peanut-butter rice cake instead. What I did was to point out that I wasn&#39;t comfortable wasting food, encouraged him to have the apple instead, but when he really only wanted the rice-cake I did give it to him. I also suggested that when he asks for food, I would ask him to stop and really listen to his tummy and see if he really wanted it. He thought that was a good idea, but mainly, it appeared to me, because it coincided with my giving him the rice cake:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, wondering how others would have handled this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\n<br/>\n____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _<br/>\nWant to start your own business?<br/>\nLearn how on Yahoo!

Mo&#39;s been wanting to make Krabby Patties, but not eat <br/>\nthem, so we&#39;ve been looking for alternatives - making them with <br/>\ncrackers, getting really cheap buns or rolls, cutting bread into <br/>\nquarters so we can make &quot;more&quot; with less materials, especially the <br/>\ncheese (she doesn&#39;t use meat, just cheese). Sometimes she&#39;ll make <br/>\nthem with paper or cloth, but she&#39;s really excited by the food <br/>\naspect. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been eating a lot of Krabby Patties - which has meant talking <br/>\nwith her about making them the way I want to eat them. Sometimes she <br/>\nwants to experiment, though, so some end up in the compost.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night, right after dinner! she wanted to make a bunch of <br/>\nKPs with crackers, but we were really low on cheese and didn&#39;t know <br/>\nif there would be money for another couple days. We do okay with <br/>\nplanning our food-use, but the KP thing sometimes throws a kink in <br/>\nthe system. We made the mistake of starting out trying to convince <br/>\nher to make them with paper - bad idea! the conversation was heading <br/>\nsouth quickly. She started breaking crackers, and I got an idea and <br/>\nsuggested we play &quot;KaratE&quot; Sandy Cheeks style with the crackers, <br/>\nsince we could stretch those more easily than the cheese. That was <br/>\nperfect, she and I played at whacking the crackers into crumbs and <br/>\nthen Mo played vacuum-cleaner-dog to suck/lick them off the counter. <br/>\nIt was hysterical! So a potentially yucky scene turned into a barrel <br/>\nof laughs for me and Mo together. <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of what made it all work out was *me* looking for an underlying <br/>\nneed, rather than focusing just on what Mo was saying she wanted. <br/>\nShe wanted to play/experiment with food *and* she wanted to do <br/>\nsomething nice with/for her mom.

In other words, I would trust that <br/>\nhe will, when he is ready to, make the connections about everything <br/>\n(including the folly of wasting food).  Until then, I have found it <br/>\nto be very freeing to look at all the consumable resources (like <br/>\nfood, toilet paper, tape) as tools through which my son learns about <br/>\nhimself and his world.  So what if an entire roll of toilet paper <br/>\ngoes to some other purpose than wiping butts?  Or, a whole jar of <br/>\nmustard gets used in some inedible concoction during an <br/>\n&quot;experiment&quot;?  Or any other resource, for that matter?  I just go out <br/>\nand buy another, and chalk it up to this joyful, unschooling life!<br/>\n<br/>\nI highly doubt my son will be an adult who &quot;wastes&quot; food creating <br/>\nweird experiments or uses up a whole roll of scotch tape making some <br/>\nweird sculpture, but I bet he&#39;ll turn a benevolent eye on *his* child <br/>\nwhen my grandchild wants to experiment with food or tastes something <br/>\nand doesn&#39;t end up eating it or takes a new roll of paper towels <br/>\noutside and tries to sop up the mud in the driveway with it just to <br/>\nsee what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure that these kinds of messy culinary experiments are exactly <br/>\nwhat we signed up for when we opted for an unschooling life!  And, <br/>\ntrusting is the key!<br/>\n<br/>\n(Truth be told, I really had to make a conscious shift in my attitude <br/>\nwhen Liam was about 18 months old before I was able to let that stuff <br/>\ngo.

This afternoon, he asked for raisins and a peanut-butter apple.  Ate the raisins, decided he didn&#39;t want the apple (already prepared, and pb apple doesn&#39;t look so appetizing if you save it for long) but asked for a peanut-butter rice cake instead.  What I did was to point out that I wasn&#39;t comfortable wasting food, encouraged him to have the apple instead, but when he really only wanted the rice-cake I did give it to him.  I also suggested that when he asks for food, I would ask him to stop and really listen to his tummy and see if he really wanted it.  He thought that was a good idea, but mainly, it appeared to me, because it coincided with my giving him the rice cake:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, wondering how others would have handled this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nWant to start your own business?<br/>\nLearn how on Yahoo!
