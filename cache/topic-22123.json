Does she know <br/>\nshe can be a teacher NOW?  For instance, she can offer a class to <br/>\nhomeschoolers sharing her knowledge (teaching) something she likes to do - <br/>\nNOW.  She can volunteer at local rec programs or library offering her <br/>\nknowledge and skills to kids (or even adults) - NOW.  Offer to assist <br/>\ncoaches or teachers at community centers, churches or temples, or other <br/>\nfacility (private or public) that caters to young people NOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone talks about something they want to do in the future - thinking <br/>\nthey don&#39;t have the &#39;required&#39; credentials...its time to think outside the <br/>\nbox...the required creditial is called desire.  Volunteering is one great <br/>\nway to create many opportunities.  What does she like to do?  What would she <br/>\nlike to teach.  Why not put her NOW time doing what she wants rather than <br/>\nrushing through her young years. postponing her desire  Heck college diploma <br/>\ncan happen at anytime (hs diploma is not necessary for college).  If she&#39;s <br/>\ninterested in learning about education theory and practice she can read <br/>\nabout it or take a course...AND she can also &#39;just do it.&#39;  I&#39;m not saying <br/>\nnever to go to college or never to get college diploma - i am saying what <br/>\nthe hell is the rush or importance of doing it quickly?  Especially when she <br/>\ncan live her dreams NOW.  And she may even discover that some folks are <br/>\nwilling to pay for her skills - NOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal life example of unschooling at work:  I know a young person who started <br/>\nteaching classes when she was 9yo.  And at 13 has a following...there are <br/>\nkids who would take anything she offers because of her enthusiasm and gifts <br/>\nas a teacher - she has experience and an established reputation.  she has <br/>\nbuilt real life credentials and competency.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t matter that she could or couldn&#39;t read.  It didn&#39;t matter that she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have diploma or degrees.  What matters is that she has confidence <br/>\nthat she can create what she wants.  Nobody told her she couldn&#39;t do <br/>\nsomething because of a peice of paper, or because of her age.  She found <br/>\nways to actualize her dreams NOW.

We did not <br/>\nunschool, but did not use a curriculum and were VERY relaxed <br/>\nabout &quot;schooling&quot;. If I had had more courage and the knowlegde and <br/>\nexperience I have now, we would have unschooled. <br/>\n    I hated school, it hindered my learning. And it was quite <br/>\nfrustrating to begin to learn about something interesting and be <br/>\nforced to switch to another topic, never being able to really get to <br/>\ndig deeper. <br/>\n    When schooling with my children, I followed my gut and did not <br/>\nforce much. I encouraged them to choose what they wanted to <br/>\nlearn/experience for as short or as long as they wished. <br/>\n    I think the difference between &quot;my&quot; schooling and unschooling is <br/>\nthat I required them to report to me weekly on what they had been <br/>\nlearning, either through a project (raising rabbits. poster, science <br/>\nexperiment...anything) or report or speech for our immediate family. <br/>\nI also forced them to do math facts(which they hated) and miquon, <br/>\nthen key to series math(which they loved) and write something<br/>\n(anything) every day. Unschooling would not require a product, or <br/>\nproof of learning. I already knew what they were doing, I just felt <br/>\nbetter about doing something &quot;official&quot;. <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tI had never heard of unschooling, although I instinctively <br/>\nembraced it to the best of my ability. Every other homeschooler I <br/>\nknew was using a rigorous curriculum(which felt like the old school <br/>\nI hated). I felt pressure to perform from family, friends, husband. <br/>\nI flet guilty for not &quot;doing school&quot; even though I knew my children <br/>\nwere learning and living more  fully than they ever could by <br/>\ndoing &quot;school&quot;. <br/>\n    Whenever we tried to &quot;school&quot;, I knew I was killing thier drive <br/>\nto live and learn so I would quit. I felt like a freak. I felt <br/>\nguilty for not &quot;doing school&quot; because I was claiming to the world <br/>\nthat I was homeschooling, but I really wasnt ( I didnt know that <br/>\nwhat we were doing had a name). <br/>\n    All I was doing was giving them tools to teach themselves. Plus, <br/>\nI hoped that my children would choose to learn a trade and do <br/>\nsomething they love rather than the traditional &quot;you must go to <br/>\ncollege to make it in life&quot; thing. People considered me crazy when <br/>\nthey learned that I was not encouraging my children to attend <br/>\ncollege unless it was necessary for thier chosen career( doctor, <br/>\nlawyer ect) I think it is foolish to waste your time and money on <br/>\ncourses toward a degree that they may never use.     <br/>\n    Anyhow... we were happily living our lives and in my gut, I knew <br/>\nwe were doing it almost right. I also experienced that they were <br/>\nhappier, and more well rounded, better adjusted and better educated <br/>\nthan the children thier same age in ps or other homeschoolers using <br/>\ntraditional curriculum.<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tMy plan was to NEVER send them to school and hoped they <br/>\nwould learn a trade to support themselves. My goal as &quot;teacher&quot; was <br/>\nnot to teach them stuff, but to show them how and where to get <br/>\ninformation so they could learn absolutly anything they wanted to <br/>\nknow. I feel that if a person knows how to get information, then <br/>\nthey can do anything they chooose.  <br/>\n    I also wanted them to be able to attend college when they were <br/>\n14 if they wished. Neither of my children wanted to do that(which <br/>\nwas fine with me, I just wanted to be sure they would not grow up <br/>\nand be angry cuz i kept them out of school).    <br/>\n    When my daughter  was 14 I felt that she had &quot;graduated&quot; <br/>\nmy &quot;school&quot;.She had the knowledge and maturity to physically make it <br/>\nin this world as an adult, but she was not emotionally ready to go <br/>\noff and work or have an apartment, so  I encouraged her to follow <br/>\nher dreams and interests wherever they may go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhen she was 15 I moved to my parents to care for them while <br/>\nthey were terminally ill( Alzheimers and cancer). I decided that I <br/>\ndid not want them home all day and night for months with no adults, <br/>\nso I sent them to school. My daughter had always dreamed of going  <br/>\nto school, so she was very excited. She was in 11th grade and got <br/>\ngood grades and had a wonderful time. <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tThe following year she wanted to go to school for her senior <br/>\nyear. I did not want her to go, but I also felt that she had <br/>\ncompleted her education and she would have wonderful memories of <br/>\na &quot;senior&quot; year. I felt that it would not damage her to go and that <br/>\nif I denied her this wish, then she may hold resentment and have <br/>\nregrets as an adult for an experience she dreamed about since she <br/>\nwas little. She was not interested in much else except going to <br/>\ncollege, but did not feel ready to attend. She just wanted to have <br/>\nfun and experience life as a &quot;normal&quot; teenager.<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tI do not force her to go to school. If she wants to come <br/>\nhome from school early or not go to school at all, I excuse her and <br/>\nshe comes home. If she were to want to drop out tomorrow, she could <br/>\ndo so. If she flunked every class, I would not care because I see <br/>\nthis as a social experience, not an educational one. <br/>\n    It is quite interesting, since I do not impose bedtimes and <br/>\ncurfues (sp?)or anything like that,  that she is home and in bed <br/>\nearly on school nights and refuses to miss school unless she is ill. <br/>\nShe even passes up day long shopping trips to the big malls to <br/>\nattend school. She manages her time well and  faithfully does her <br/>\nhomework. <br/>\n    She has set a goal of graduating with a good grade point average <br/>\nand attending University (rather than community college). She lives <br/>\nher life as an adult but does check in with me as to where she is <br/>\ngoing and with who and when she thinks she will be returning, which <br/>\nis a considerate thing to do with anyone you live with.<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tShe tells me that the way the schools &quot;teach&quot; is extreemly <br/>\ninferior to natural learning. She stuffs facts and spits them back <br/>\nout for the test, and does not retain the information. Also the <br/>\nstuff is boring because the information is fragmented and <br/>\nirrellivent (sp?) to her life and interests. She does enjoy her <br/>\nclasses and assignments that allow her to research and experience a <br/>\ntopic and the teachers are always pleased at her ability to express <br/>\nherself.<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tShe loves the social interaction with all the teens ( minus <br/>\nthe occasional drama). She goes to all the school functions and <br/>\ndances and parties. She is a member of the cheerleading team and <br/>\nwanted to join other clubs and teams, but the ones she is interested <br/>\nin conflict with her cheerleading schedule. She is experiencing her <br/>\nsenior year to its fullest and is planning on having the full <br/>\ncollege experience, with dorm life and work study and all that.<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tI would never have chosen these things for her, because I <br/>\nbelieve that that sort of schooling is more of a hindrance to <br/>\ngetting on with your life then really living...but to her, these <br/>\nthings are &quot;rights of passage&quot; and are a part of her social <br/>\nexperience rather than a learning experience, although she takes <br/>\ngetting a  degree seriously.    <br/>\n    She is aware there are other ways to achieve these educational <br/>\ngoals. She is an individual,  and does not share every belief that I <br/>\nshare ( actually she is quite different than me and has chosen a <br/>\nvery different lifestyle than I have modeled for her),  I will <br/>\nsupport her no matter what paths she chooses to follow. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tI have not shared much about my oldest, since he was not <br/>\ninterested in school or a degree. He is 18. He attended 1/2 a year <br/>\nof high school and felt it was a waste of his time, although not a <br/>\nterrible experience. He knows that he learns more effectively on his <br/>\nown, and the material they taught was stuff he already knew. <br/>\n    He is amazing with computers, writing songs and music, guitar, <br/>\npiano, singing and other things. He enjoys a wide variety of things, <br/>\nis reliable and people enjoy him. He has turned out to be a <br/>\nwonderful man. <br/>\n    He has chosen to enlist in the Navy and will be attending <br/>\ncollege to learn more about computer stuff on base for 2 years, then <br/>\ngo on to active duty for 4 years. He is considering a career in the <br/>\nNavy so he can retire when he is 50 and have enough energy and money <br/>\npursue his interests for the rest of his life.  <br/>\n    It is very sad for me to have him in the military, but I am also <br/>\nvery proud of him. It is a huge thing to give up your constitutional <br/>\nrights to serve your country. I tried to gently discourage him, but <br/>\nI have never been good at not supporting the things my children feel <br/>\nare important, or things they want to do, so as soon as I realized <br/>\nthat he really wanted to be in the Navy, I became his biggest <br/>\nsupporter.  He is only in boot camp right now, but he writes home <br/>\nregularly stating that it is easier than he imagined and he really <br/>\nlikes it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI have 9 and 11 yo boys. I had never really gotten around <br/>\nto &quot;doing school&quot; every day or in any way regularly. It was sort of <br/>\nhit and miss. They learned to read, do math and other &quot;normal&quot; <br/>\nthings without much &quot;teaching&quot; from me. They even learned to write, <br/>\nbut now I wish I had taught them how to form thier letters a <br/>\nstandard way. <br/>\n    During my parents illnes and the year before I did not &quot;do <br/>\nschool&quot; at all with them. When I was able to &quot; do school&quot; I realized <br/>\nthat thier learning had progressed at the same rate as it would have <br/>\nit we had been &quot;doing school&quot; and in some areas was accelerated( <br/>\nscience, nature, math). <br/>\n    I always suspected that people do not need to be forced to <br/>\nlearn, but I had not really just completely let them go thier own <br/>\nway. <br/>\n    During those 2 years they did not really do anything that looked <br/>\ntoo much like school. They spent most of thier time in our creek, <br/>\nclimbing trees, collecting critters, experiencing nature. They <br/>\nobserved the plant and animal life grow and change every day for 2 <br/>\nyears. They saw tadpoles become frogs, snakes shed thier skins, bugs <br/>\neat bugs, plants bloom and fade and come back the following year. <br/>\nThey watched neat programs on tv. They read when they felt like <br/>\nit...or not. they wrote letters, drew pictures, painted. cooked, <br/>\ncleaned, built things, help build and fix things, got dirty, played <br/>\non the &quot;leap pad&quot;, played video games, watched movies and many other <br/>\nthings that children love to do when they are not bogged down being <br/>\nforced to read and write and produce things that are not important <br/>\nto them. They just lived life fully, played hard and had fun! <br/>\n    If someone had been observing our life, it would look as though  <br/>\nnothing academic was going on in our home, but they learned anyhow. <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tI always said that my children learn in spite of me, that <br/>\nthey will learn more and better if I just get out of the way and let <br/>\nit happen. My youngest boys have proven this theory to be true. Now <br/>\nI hope my husband will see it so he will quit bugging me about when <br/>\nI am going to start &quot;doing school&quot; with the boys again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI intended to share my daughters desire and experience with <br/>\nschool and hopes for college, but I also ended up sharing a chunk of <br/>\nour history. I wrote with the hope that our experiences will <br/>\nencourage you to continue assisting your daughter find HER way in <br/>\nlife, no matter what others think of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"&quot;Melissa&quot; &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Early Diplomas?

First of all, they probably<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t see it as &quot;studying&quot; anything...just an interest. We&#39;d find a<br/>\nphycisist to hang out with, or play games or any number of options<br/>\nthat would involve a more natural way to connect the dots of information.<br/>\n<br/>\nFormal classes would be the bottom of the list, especially for an<br/>\n8y.o......or even an 18y.o. unless they had decided they were now<br/>\ninterested in some kind of formal study. It&#39;s not unheard of, for an<br/>\nunschooled child to follow formal studies. But at 8? or 12? Most of<br/>\nthem are happily following their interests too much to be bothered by<br/>\nthinking about &quot;studying&quot; anything.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be trying to help my child let go of the notion that they need<br/>\nany paper to get on with their lives.

If she really thinks it&#39;s that important, why<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t she want to actually attain it by doing something valuable to<br/>\nher throughout the process?<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":299286442,"authorName":"Cameron Parham","from":"Cameron Parham &lt;acsp2205@...&gt;","profile":"acsp2205","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Early Diplomas?

I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s unschooling in even the <br/>\nbroasdest sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt&#39;s idea was to NOT do school. Not do it faster!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, this is something my DD wants.  We have discussed<br/>\nthe &quot;no need&quot; issues before.  She needs the security of the &quot;papers&quot;<br/>\nfor HER peace of mind.  (Please note she spent 6 years in PS!)<br/>\nPlease, also understand this is NOT something we are &quot;pushing&quot; her<br/>\ninto.  This was HER desire, her want.  It IS our comprimise.  And,<br/>\nyes, we have looked for loop holes...but that is no different<br/>\nthan &quot;flying under the radar&quot;.  We have just chosen a legal loop<br/>\nhole.  I agree with a diploma isn&#39;t nessecary to be happy or<br/>\nsuccessful.  But I also believe there are cases that a diploma would<br/>\nbe nessecary...especially based on the fact that DD WANTS one and<br/>\nwants to do it NOW.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI get that she wants it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also understand how heavy peer/societal pressure is at 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron had those same ideas at 13 when he left school. He was being <br/>\ntold by all his friends that he would be stupid, not get a diploma, and <br/>\nnever get a job. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him that I knew it was hard, but that if he could just be <br/>\npatient.... it wouldn&#39;t be long before his friends all HATED school and <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t wait to be done so that their lives could *finally* begin. <br/>\nThey&#39;d complain about their teachers, their classes and how stupid <br/>\nschool was.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was right. &lt;g&gt; It wasn&#39;t two years before high school was a reality. <br/>\nThen *Camern* has the great life. Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, the idea behind this isn&#39;t that she&#39;ll &quot;stop&quot; learning or<br/>\nthat she &quot;has&quot; to learn prescribed things or that she will be doing<br/>\nsomething other than what makes her happy.  The idea is: if all she<br/>\nwants is the paper…why should she have to do all of the stuff she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to do to get it (like go to school)?  If working<br/>\ntowards an early degree is what she wants and it makes her happy…<br/>\nisn&#39;t that reason enough?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nShe IS doing all the stuff to get it. Jumping through their <br/>\nhoops---just in her own way. It&#39;s still jumping, and they&#39;re still <br/>\nhoops.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she *may* stop learning---or at least stop finding it fun and <br/>\nexciting! To get the diplomas, she WILL have to learn prescribed <br/>\nthings---that&#39;s how schools work!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, our thoughts are: why make her wait?  There are no rules by<br/>\nany authority stating that she has to be a certain age for a HS<br/>\ndiploma or a college degree.  If she wants to do it, it&#39;ll make her<br/>\nhappy, and can pull it off at this point in her life...WHY should we<br/>\nstop her?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou shouldn&#39;t. But I doubt it will like like what she thinks it&#39;ll look <br/>\nlike. Be realistic. Examine it further. Maybe we&#39;re all wrong! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMost here will emphatically state that Unschooling is about letting<br/>\nthe child make choices about their learning and happiness, to not<br/>\nlet society dictate what a child can and cannot do, to let the whole<br/>\nchild decide what feels best and meets their needs…why then does it<br/>\nseem like you&#39;re saying otherwise now?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling IS those things---and MORE. But it&#39;s more about learning <br/>\nthrough living, not an accelerated course in diploma-seeking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the silly thing is: she IS letting society dictate that she needs <br/>\ntwo diplomas! Does *she* not see that?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\n  If your 8 year old said he wanted to learn about physics on the <br/>\nUniversity level…even choosing<br/>\nto attend classes at the institution…would you hold him back because<br/>\nhe&#39;s 8 or because you don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; he needs to…or would you find<br/>\na way to let him follow his desire and support him…even if his goal<br/>\nwas to be a degreed/certified Physics Professor teaching in that<br/>\ninstitution?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI;d make every effort to show him many different ways to learn about <br/>\nphysics. If we&#39;d exhausted the NATURAL way to learn physics, then yes, <br/>\nI would help to enroll him in a physics class at the university.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n BTW, did I mention that my DD&#39;s desire is to be a PS<br/>\nteacher!!!???  So, Liberal Arts would be an &quot;effective&quot; degree for<br/>\nher…if you want to look at it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she loves public school and believes in it---that&#39;s true, right? I <br/>\nmean, why would someone chose to do something she doesn&#39;t believe in? <br/>\nWHY isn&#39;t she in school getting the best education they can provide? <br/>\nWhy does she feel the need to go the homeschooled route?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd too---and accelerated homeschool program in order to TEACH in a <br/>\nschool? I think she&#39;d need to at least be older than the children she <br/>\nis teaching. If it&#39;s not a prerequisite in the school system, I&#39;d be <br/>\nsurprised.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we look at it this way: whether she gets the degree or not<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter…it&#39;s that she is trying for something she wants.  She<br/>\nset a goal and wants to work for it.  So yes, we are excited and<br/>\nproud of and for her…no different than a kid learning to tie hisown<br/>\nshoes.  You all brag when your children have set forth goals (even<br/>\nif informally) and strive to meet them…why should our situation be<br/>\ndifferent?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about bragging rights. It&#39;s about the WHY she feels it&#39;s <br/>\nnecessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nHell. it&#39;s not even that. She can do whatever floats her boat---and she <br/>\ncan change her mind tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut calling it unschooling?---it&#39;s not.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, we also know that she is still a child, and with that said,<br/>\nchildren often change their minds quickly.  She may decide this path<br/>\nisn&#39;t for her and move onto something else.  And if that is the<br/>\ncase, it would be a relief to not have dished out excessive $$ and<br/>\ntime for something she puts down.  If we/she had…it would only<br/>\nempahsize the senses of dissapointment and failure in the long run…I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to put her through that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not understanding that. Not that she could (and probably will) <br/>\nchange her mind. But the failure and disappointment thingy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we know we can start and stop whenever we want---where&#39;s the failure <br/>\nand disappointment in it?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-===-<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;  I believe the original discussion was about a parent supporting<br/>\ntheir teenager in acquiring a undergraduate degree at an early age<br/>\nsimply for the purpose of having the piece of paper so she can put<br/>\nit all behind her (satisfying mainstream criteria) and get on with<br/>\nliving her life. As unschoolers I don&#39;t want my kids to have to wait<br/>\nuntil they&#39;ve completed a college degree to start living their<br/>\nlives.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, thanks so much, Lisa, for your POV…I think you got what I was<br/>\ntrying to say and summed it up nicely.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what Lisa also said was that she doesn&#39;t want her children to think <br/>\nthat their lives start AFTER they get a degree.

But it didn&#39;t help him deschool. <br/>\nHe was still stuck, and our family was still stuck, just in a <br/>\ndifferent way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She needs the security of the &quot;papers&quot; <br/>\n&gt; for HER peace of mind. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The really serious thing to consider is whether having papers will <br/>\ngive her the security she is looking for. They certainly won&#39;t <br/>\nbe &quot;proof&quot; that she has learned something or achieved some goal, so <br/>\nits possible that having the diploma will end up leaving her feeling <br/>\nless secure, not more. It certainly begs the question - what happens <br/>\nif someone &quot;finds out&quot;? That&#39;s a question that could end up haunting <br/>\nher and leaving her feeling even more insecure than she does now. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour dd is afraid. That may not be something you can easily fix, <br/>\nmom - and that&#39;s hard to swallow. We all want to ease our kids <br/>\nsuffering and do it Right Now! But sometimes our desire to help <br/>\nleads us to distract our kids and ourselves from the very issues we <br/>\nand they need to work on and move through in order to go on growing <br/>\nas people. The diploma is a distraction. In a way, its an <br/>\nInvalidation of her fears - fears that without school she won&#39;t <br/>\nlearn, won&#39;t be good enough, won&#39;t be desirable, won&#39;t be <br/>\nsuccessful. Once she has it, if she&#39;s still fearful, she&#39;ll be less <br/>\nlikely to admit it - she *should* be happy, she got what she <br/>\n*wanted*. Guilt added to fear. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You all brag when your children have set forth goals (even <br/>\n&gt; if informally) and strive to meet them?why should our situation be <br/>\n&gt; different?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The day before we informed the school we were pulling Ray out, <br/>\nhe &quot;decided&quot; to stay. He was panicking. He didn&#39;t care about school. <br/>\nHe didn&#39;t want to be there - but he&#39;d been there 7yrs, it was what <br/>\nhe &quot;knew&quot;. There was a story on NPR awhile back about a flood in a <br/>\ntown of circus professionals. The elephants drowned bc they refused <br/>\nto leave their homes. They panicked and stuck with what they knew.<br/>\n<br/>\n When kids are deschooling they need a Lot of emotional support. <br/>\nThey need us to be able to look past their stated needs and wants to <br/>\nthe underlying messages of loss and helplessness. They need help <br/>\nmoving beyond that loss and helplessness. That&#39;s challenging! <br/>\nespecially when *we&#39;re* deschooling right along with them, <br/>\nstruggling with our own fears. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You all brag when your children have set forth goals (even <br/>\n&gt; if informally) and strive to meet them?why should our situation be <br/>\n&gt; different?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m reading here that one of your fears is that as an unschooler, <br/>\nyou lose the chance of bragging rights you had access to with a kid <br/>\nin school. You won&#39;t ever, ever get one of those bumper stickers, <br/>\nyou won&#39;t get to send out invites to her graduation, you don&#39;t get <br/>\nto keep the yearbooks in the cedar chest with the first shoes and <br/>\nlock of hair and lost tooth. You&#39;re trying to substitute &quot;early <br/>\ndegrees&quot; so you can get back some of those bragging rights. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe papers won&#39;t help you grieve for those things.

However, I think some of you may have <br/>\nmissed my point.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, this is something my DD wants.  We have discussed <br/>\nthe &quot;no need&quot; issues before.  She needs the security of the &quot;papers&quot; <br/>\nfor HER peace of mind.  (Please note she spent 6 years in PS!)  <br/>\nPlease, also understand this is NOT something we are &quot;pushing&quot; her <br/>\ninto.  This was HER desire, her want.  It IS our comprimise.  And, <br/>\nyes, we have looked for loop holes...but that is no different <br/>\nthan &quot;flying under the radar&quot;.  We have just chosen a legal loop <br/>\nhole.  I agree with a diploma isn&#39;t nessecary to be happy or <br/>\nsuccessful.  But I also believe there are cases that a diploma would <br/>\nbe nessecary...especially based on the fact that DD WANTS one and <br/>\nwants to do it NOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, the idea behind this isn&#39;t that she&#39;ll &quot;stop&quot; learning or <br/>\nthat she &quot;has&quot; to learn prescribed things or that she will be doing <br/>\nsomething other than what makes her happy.  The idea is: if all she <br/>\nwants is the paperwhy should she have to do all of the stuff she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to do to get it (like go to school)?  If working <br/>\ntowards an early degree is what she wants and it makes her happy<br/>\nisn&#39;t that reason enough?<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, our thoughts are: why make her wait?  There are no rules by <br/>\nany authority stating that she has to be a certain age for a HS <br/>\ndiploma or a college degree.  If she wants to do it, it&#39;ll make her <br/>\nhappy, and can pull it off at this point in her life...WHY should we <br/>\nstop her?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMost here will emphatically state that Unschooling is about letting <br/>\nthe child make choices about their learning and happiness, to not <br/>\nlet society dictate what a child can and cannot do, to let the whole <br/>\nchild decide what feels best and meets their needswhy then does it <br/>\nseem like you&#39;re saying otherwise now?  If your 8 year old said he <br/>\nwanted to learn about physics on the University leveleven choosing <br/>\nto attend classes at the institutionwould you hold him back because <br/>\nhe&#39;s 8 or because you don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; he needs toor would you find <br/>\na way to let him follow his desire and support himeven if his goal <br/>\nwas to be a degreed/certified Physics Professor teaching in that <br/>\ninstitution?  BTW, did I mention that my DD&#39;s desire is to be a PS <br/>\nteacher!!!???  So, Liberal Arts would be an &quot;effective&quot; degree for <br/>\nherif you want to look at it that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we look at it this way: whether she gets the degree or not <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matterit&#39;s that she is trying for something she wants.  She <br/>\nset a goal and wants to work for it.  So yes, we are excited and <br/>\nproud of and for herno different than a kid learning to tie hisown <br/>\nshoes.  You all brag when your children have set forth goals (even <br/>\nif informally) and strive to meet themwhy should our situation be <br/>\ndifferent?<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, we also know that she is still a child, and with that said, <br/>\nchildren often change their minds quickly.  She may decide this path <br/>\nisn&#39;t for her and move onto something else.  And if that is the <br/>\ncase, it would be a relief to not have dished out excessive $$ and <br/>\ntime for something she puts down.  If we/she hadit would only <br/>\nempahsize the senses of dissapointment and failure in the long runI <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to put her through that.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;  I believe the original discussion was about a parent supporting <br/>\ntheir teenager in acquiring a undergraduate degree at an early age <br/>\nsimply for the purpose of having the piece of paper so she can put <br/>\nit all behind her (satisfying mainstream criteria) and get on with <br/>\nliving her life. As unschoolers I don&#39;t want my kids to have to wait <br/>\nuntil they&#39;ve completed a college degree to start living their <br/>\nlives.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, thanks so much, Lisa, for your POVI think you got what I was <br/>\ntrying to say and summed it up nicely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie Peters</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94040812,"authorName":"Lisa Heyman","from":"&quot;Lisa Heyman&quot; &lt;Lmanathome@...&gt;","profile":"lmanathome","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Early Diplomas?

I am not saying this is ideal, only true. The example of a physician is a good one; also a researcher in most fields, physical therapist, etc.  I&#39;d never value anyone according to any societal label, and I know for happiness, many people don&#39;t need a degree. But I also want to give my kids a life foundation which allows them the freedom to choose carrers which do require a degree if they want. In short, aren&#39;t we aiming for greater freedom?  I&#39;d love to hear thoughts on this, and whether there seems to come a time when a person/child may desire to do a course of study which would necessitate memorization/bookwork....this seemed to be the case in the Colfaxes&#39; book, Homeschooling for<br/>\n Excellence.

All high school can be unschooled. Much of <br/>\ncollege can too (credits for work). I know of a girl who got into <br/>\nveterinary school without a college diploma.

Especially for a 13 year old. There&#39;s nothing unschooly <br/>\nabout that kind of rushed learning. Fine for a child who must go to <br/>\nschool---rush through---please! &lt;g&gt; But for a child whose whole life is <br/>\nopen and free, it just makes no sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nCollege isn&#39;t really about the paper. It&#39;s more about the experience. <br/>\nMost kids have very little choice while in school. They aren&#39;t allowed <br/>\nto question. They must abide by a bunch of silly rules. College for the <br/>\naverage teen is HUGE---NOT the classes and diplomas, but the new <br/>\npeople, the (limited) autonomy, the exposure to an unknown world. It&#39;s <br/>\neye-opening for most teens/young adults. It&#39;s about questioning and <br/>\nseeking and making new friends and experimenting and learning for <br/>\nlearning&#39;s sake---unlike high school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child were rushing though college too---why bother? *Just* for the <br/>\ndiploma?

However, for my DD<br/>\n(13), it is important to her to &quot;fit in&quot; to the societal norm of having<br/>\na diploma...for her peace of mind.  She has always been driven by the<br/>\nexternal (friends, hollywood, etc.) albeit, to a much lesser degree than<br/>\nmost.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here is what we are doing...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe decided (as a family...it is so cool to think we all agreed on<br/>\nthis...even DH!) that we would have DD finish/get her HS diploma<br/>\nearly...June 2008...she&#39;ll be 14 yo!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe use an umbrella school (for those in TN it&#39;s HLA) and forge/fake<br/>\nsubjects, grades, attendance, etc. to meet the TN credit/attendance<br/>\nrequirements.  We also are &quot;working the system&quot; per se.  TN states that<br/>\na student must attend for 180 days per fiscal year (per grade). <br/>\nHowever, there are 2 sets of 180 days in a year (365) so we are saying<br/>\nshe is completing 2 years of HS in 1 fiscal year.  We reported that she<br/>\ndid and completed 9th grade from July-Dec 2006, is now doing and will<br/>\ncomplete 10th grade from Jan-June 2007, 11th from July-Dec 2007, and<br/>\nfinish 12th from Jan-June 2008.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key here is that it is just a piece of paper and fulfilling the<br/>\nlaw...albeit, through loop holes.  (HLA&#39;s diplomas are fully accredited<br/>\nor we would just make one up and hit &quot;print&quot;.)  That is all DD<br/>\nwants...is the paper, for security (it being accredited is even better).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what we are thinking of &quot;next&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause DD will be so young, because we don&#39;t want to torture her in a<br/>\nclassroom, because of all the hoops and red tape and because &quot;why waste<br/>\nall that time and money?&quot;...we don&#39;t want her to go to a traditional<br/>\ncollege.  We had thought of a class or two at the local community<br/>\ncollege but even that was a push for what we think is practical and<br/>\nethical.  SO...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been looking into the idea of CLEP-ing a college degree for DD<br/>\n(and for DH and me to finish ours).  We were turned on to<br/>\nCollegePlus.org through a magazine.  BUT after looking into it we<br/>\ndiscovered they are asking for a fee to &quot;coach&quot; you and organize your<br/>\ntests/testing schedule...something you can do completely on your own for<br/>\nfree...there&#39;s not even any red tape!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hunt began and we discovered that there are at least 3 colleges in<br/>\nthe U.S. that accept 100% &quot;credit-through-testing&quot; to earn your BA/BS<br/>\n(fully-accredited).  And that the typical BA/BS (normally 4-5 years on<br/>\ncampus, in a classroom) can be earned in UNDER a year (for some, in as<br/>\nlittle as 4 months)!!  And the cost to &quot;test-out&quot; of college...about $5<br/>\n- 8,000 for a BA/BS depending on which college you use AND that is all<br/>\ninclusive of study materials, tuition, and testing (conventionally $5K+<br/>\nper year, if not per semester)!<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, it is nothing more than the quest for the golden &quot;piece of<br/>\npaper&quot;.  We don&#39;t care about mastering material (at least not after the<br/>\ntest is taken), the college experience, being prepared for a prestigious<br/>\ncareer, etc.  We just want the degree as cheap and a quick as<br/>\npossible...even though we don&#39;t think it is nessecary or an accurate<br/>\naccount of one&#39;s knowledge...that is what society wants.  So why not<br/>\ngive it to them...and then when they find out how easily, quickly,<br/>\ncheaply, legitimately, and &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; it was done, they&#39;ll faint<br/>\nwishing they didn&#39;t waste all their time, money, and dignity on the<br/>\nconventional method!<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you imagine if the tide was turned by earning entire college<br/>\ndegrees by testing...that you could do it cheaply in under a year and<br/>\nnever having to step foot on a campus?  It could put traditional<br/>\ncolleges out of business!  Just like H/Using is starting to enlighten<br/>\nthe PS system to their faults...&quot;testing-out&quot; will do the<br/>\nsame...eventually, if it catches on.  Right now it is a &quot;hush-hush<br/>\nsecret&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis just seems like it is the Unschooling thing to do.  It serves 2<br/>\nUSing purposes...not attending an institution with all their hoops and<br/>\nrules...and learning at your own pace with the bonus of the gloriously<br/>\nover-emphasized and highly-coveted, &quot;piece of paper&quot;!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur DD gets the societal &quot;norm&quot; she wants (diploma/degree) and we get<br/>\nthe satisfaction of Unschooling both papers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, because it is &quot;testing-out&quot; not attending, she could actually<br/>\nstart taking the CLEP exams now (they are good for 20 years) before she<br/>\nreceives her HS diploma (no need for ACT scores or anything)...so<br/>\ntechnically and if she wanted to try, she could have her BA/BS and her<br/>\nHS diploma awarded at the same time!<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep thinking of Valerie Fitzenreiter&#39;s book (The Unprocessed Child)<br/>\nand her daughter, Laurie Chancey.  I know that Laurie went to college<br/>\nand did quite will...and still is.  But I was wondering...&quot;What if she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t ever have to go...what if she simply tested-out...just like she<br/>\ntested for her enterance?&quot;  She could have gotten the same results<br/>\nwithout ever having to go to ANY school, ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions:<br/>\n<br/>\nARE WE NUTS??...for wanting to do this; thinking it is even possible;<br/>\nfor attmpting to have a 14 yo be a HS graduate with the potential of a<br/>\nBA/BS before 16; for actually (emotionally and mentally) being at peace<br/>\nwith that idea; for wanting the degrees in the first place (even if we<br/>\ndo buck the system)?<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure this is what USing is supposed to be about, right?
