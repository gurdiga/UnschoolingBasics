It&#39;s hard to understand how<br/>\nwe can use math before we understand it but the way it works in real life is<br/>\nwe absorb a basic understanding by seeing numbers being used around us. And<br/>\nwe absorb a basic understanding. And then we can see how to apply that basic<br/>\nunderstanding and use it. And as it we use it, we get better at it and<br/>\nundertand more.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnglish is a tool that helps us get what we want. As with all kids, my<br/>\ndaughter began with no knowledge of English and absorbed the parts that tied<br/>\ninto the things about life that interested her. No one crammed English into<br/>\nher so that she&#39;d be able to use it. And she used bits and pieces inexpertly<br/>\nto get what she wanted. For a long time she used &quot;Here&quot; for &quot;Pick me up&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;Let me have that&quot;, &quot;Take me over there&quot;, &quot;Take this&quot;. It wasn&#39;t &quot;correct&quot;<br/>\nbut it worked for what she needed. And even though it worked, she didn&#39;t<br/>\nstop there. She improved as a side effect of using English. She now uses<br/>\nfull sentences that other people can understand :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory (as defined by school) isn&#39;t much use unless it ties to something we<br/>\nwant to know more about. Reading the Little House series isn&#39;t history (as<br/>\ndefined by school) but -- *if* a child is enjoying it and wants to read it<br/>\n-- then tidbits of what was going on in the world that help a child<br/>\nunderstand the parts of the story they cared about better become important<br/>\nand interesting to the child. And if they care about any of the tidbits,<br/>\nthen more tidbits that tie to those become important. Real history isn&#39;t a<br/>\nstring of memorized names and dates. Real history (and science and math and<br/>\nEnglish) is how one thing connects to another.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the connections that are the important part of learning. No one can<br/>\ngive someone connections because there isn&#39;t one right way to connect<br/>\neverything. Connections are what you pick up and assembly yourself by<br/>\nleading a rich life.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196090915,"authorName":"J. Stauffer","from":"&quot;J.

There is no reason outside of a classroom for a 12 year old to know how to write a paper or even a lot about history unless these are particular interests of the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids learned those specific kinds of things later but with tremendous ease.  They learned them when they actually needed them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 14 yo is a died in the wool traditionalist &lt;sigh&gt; and has decided that the University of Georgia is in her future.  They require an accredited diploma or a very high SAT score to even consider you....so Adriane has decided to follow a very traditional curriculum to prepare.  She had zero math &quot;training&quot; from second grade until now.  She stepped right into Algebra and is doing fantastic (A average).  She is able to do what she wants, how she wants and we were able to avoid 7 years of me MAKING her do her homework.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had never written a paper, nothing more formal than email, in her life.  I showed her how to structure one and off she went and did fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids actually know a lot of history but most of it was picked up from conversations, television, video games, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: cartoontv5 <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, January 10, 2005 1:16 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] More Questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  What do you do about grammar and english?

He reads H.P<br/>\nLovecraft for pleasure and while that may be considered by some the first<br/>\nsign of insanity, he&#39;s understanding the language and enjoying the<br/>\nstories. <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan&#39;s Karate instructor, who had a degree in early childhood<br/>\ndevelopment, used to say &quot;Don&#39;t kick nobody!&quot; when he&#39;d have his students<br/>\nline up for drills.  Formal education doesn&#39;t ensure grammar skills. <br/>\n<br/>\n***What about history and math,science?***<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory is Dylan&#39;s great aunt Dortha who was born in 1917.  History is<br/>\nGrandpa Ron&#39;s pocket watch.  History is Grandpa Lloyd&#39;s WWII Japanese<br/>\ntranslation book.   History is every Passover with Grandma and aunt Ruth.<br/>\n History is the replica of the Globe theater on top of our hundred year<br/>\nold piano.   History is his Welsh and Jewish and Dutch and Native<br/>\nAmerican ancestry.  History is a stop at a ghost town, or graveyard or an<br/>\nabandoned mine, a trip to Boston, a constellation in the night sky.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath is counting change, making a deposit to a savings account, adding<br/>\nscore in Scrabble and Cribbage, shopping at the book store, doubling the<br/>\nrecipe for tortillas, measuring boards for a bookshelf, planting double<br/>\nrows of bush beans.   <br/>\n<br/>\nScience is setting a broken bird wing, digging for crystals, grafting<br/>\napple trees, refinishing old rocking chairs, making fudge, rewiring a<br/>\nlamp, building and soldering armatures for clay models. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I know you can learn a lot of things from everyday life <br/>\nbut how do the kids learn history or english and how to write a <br/>\nproper letter or things like that?***<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan knows about bits of history because his dad is a kind of history<br/>\nbuff and his mom is curious and because we&#39;re alive.  It&#39;s impossible to<br/>\nwatch the news or the Simpsons or a movie and not find a reference to<br/>\nsome bit of history.  It&#39;s impossible to talk with people or read about<br/>\npeople and not come away with questions about how they got to be who and<br/>\nwhat they are. <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan can write a fairly nice letter because we read letters to him all<br/>\nhis life.  We read letters from friends, we read letters to friends.  We<br/>\nread letters from salesmen and credit card companies and charities.   He<br/>\ncan write a proper letter because he could always ask his mom and dad for<br/>\nhelp if he needed to. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78615010,"authorName":"mamaaj2000","from":"&quot;mamaaj2000&quot; &lt;mamaaj2000@...&gt;","profile":"mamaaj2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: More Questions","postDate":"1105388163","msgId":4611,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNydW5xMysyMWU3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyYi41NDIxZjNjOS4yZjE0MzM0NEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":4610,"nextInTopic":4614,"prevInTime":4610,"nextInTime":4612,"topicId":4609,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... list of ...
