Why do you want to unschool? <br/>\n<br/>\n***... most of what u all say and do, cannot<br/>\nbe applied to an Indian home. :( ***<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you elaborate?

The next time you&#39;re going to respond to your child, stop for a moment and think about what you want to say and how you want to say it and how you will appear in your child&#39;s eyes.    Then choose the words that will most benefit your child and will be the least likely to leave you wishing you hadn&#39;t said them.   It will take time.  <br/>\nStopping to think will be really helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\nApologize if you say something you regret. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32101,"nextTopicId":32317}}
