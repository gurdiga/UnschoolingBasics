When I quit an extremely lucrative job to stay home when my oldest daughter","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2051784713\">I find this a fascinating question. Here are some observations about what we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I quit an extremely lucrative job to stay home when my oldest daughter was born, I created an account just for me with about 6 months of salary in it.  That is my &quot;slush&quot; fund.  As it turns out other than to make sizeable loans to my family at different times, I haven&#39;t spent any of that money in the 7 years it has been there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut knowing it is there makes it psychologically much easier for me not to spend money at the rate that I did when we had two professional incomes and no kids.  For example, before when an author I liked had a new book out, I bought it immediately. In hardcover.  I bought myself expensive jewelry.  I ate in restaurants frequently.  Now I get books from the libray, rarely wear jewelry,  almost never eat out.  But knowing that  I CAN buy whatever-it-is  if I really want to, I think helps me not to  want or need to.<br/>\n<br/>\nLydia (not quite 7) knows that whatever thing she truly wants, she can have.  But it doesn&#39;t translate into her wanting everything.  In fact, It seems to translate into her not desparately wanting anything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do have a lot of toys (that we buy her and that she buys herself) --  but she tends to be content to buy them in small doses.  For example, she recently went to the store to buy some fairy-barbies with saved allowance.  She decided once she was there that she would only buy one - so she could spread the excitement of getting a new barbie over two outings, rather than just one. <br/>\n<br/>\n We love to look at catalogs and pick out things we might want to have - but like Robyn&#39;s experience, a lot of the things don&#39;t last as wants past looking through the catalog.  We also discuss things in terms of comparable value -- like that toy is worth 2 barbies or 4 polly pockets.  Some things that she likes we look for in thrift stores because she likes them but not at the expense of other things.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed that she has started asking to do some research on toys that cost more than say $20 to see if she would really like them.  I&#39;ve never really talked about doing that -- but I know that she sees us research things like digital cameras and the like.  She recently saw a TV commercial for a toy called a Blinkie and she asked me to see if I could find any reviews on the internet to see if kids really liked them.  She read some reviews (and wrote her own) and bought the Blinkie (which she is enjoying). <br/>\n<br/>\nHer discretionary spending line item on the family budget comes out to $6.00/week (plus we are now starting to pay her interest at 2% compounded weekly on her savings).  She currently has about $30 saved.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure that I&#39;m doing a good job of explaining what we do -- in practice what happens is that we can buy (as gifts or through her allowance) her everything that she wants -- but her level of wants seems well tailored to our financial abilities.  Although now that I think about it - my parents had far less money than my husband and I have -- but I grew up feeling like I had everyting that I wanted and  my wants also corresponded to my parents&#39; financial abilities.  It just works for us - but I guess the bottom line is that I&#39;m not sure exactly why.   <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the original question, though, if we had a windfall of 1/2 million dollars, we would probably not spend any differently than we do now.  I guess I woudl tend to base our budgeted spending on our regular income.  If we won at least 10M in a lottery, my husband would quit work, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;d spend differently.  If we won $50M, we&#39;d spend differently.  ;-  )  I guess for me, it would take a lot of savings in order to trickle down into our spending budget.  If, however, I was coming from a situation where my chidlren had rarely been able to get what they wanted, I would use the money to be able to say yes much more frequently - rather than risk creating a situation where a windfall made the rest of their life seem more constricted than before. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am a great believer in instant gratification and instantly gratify myself and others whenever possible.  It doesn&#39;t seem to make me (I hope!) or my children selfish or demanding.   <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Steven Cox <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, October 08, 2004 10:24 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Another money &quot;problem&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry Kelly, I sort of mixed things up!

She and I turn over the corner of the<br/>\npage where the item is featured that either of us are interested in. However<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t always translate to continuing to want the item after the<br/>\ncatalogue has been closed. Often I will go online to look at the item, ready<br/>\nto order it, and Jayn will look again at the larger photo and change her<br/>\nmind. Also if something seems overpriced for what it is, we will wait for<br/>\nthe clearance sale. Occasionally we will go to the actual store (if the<br/>\ncatalog company has one) to check out the item in person. At the end of the<br/>\nday we actually purchase many fewer either toys or clothes than how many<br/>\nJayn expressed initial interest in, without even getting into the &quot;too<br/>\nexpensive&quot; conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest I felt a little put upon that the number $5000 turned out to be<br/>\na hypothetical, but also not surprised that it was an exaggeration. After<br/>\nall that would be fifty $100 toys - and most of the toys that Jayn looks at<br/>\nare between $10-30 - rarely getting up to $100 (see my previous post about<br/>\nspace in the home). It was hard to believe you’re your 4yo really wanted<br/>\nthat much small stuff. However that $ amount would not be unreasonable if he<br/>\nwas asking for a cedar gym, swing and slide set with treehouse, an above<br/>\nground pool and a full size trampoline for your backyard, all of which would<br/>\ngive years of ongoing enjoyment to the entire family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis idea that children have to be &quot;taught the value of money&quot; is one that<br/>\nbears examination. To me money has no value in itself - only in terms of<br/>\nwhat it can purchase - all the material goods and services that we need to<br/>\nlive, as well as luxuries to make life more pleasant for us and others. How<br/>\nfar a dollar will go depends also on where one lives - housing costs,<br/>\ngasoline, utilities, health insurance, various kinds of taxes - all these<br/>\nvary tremendously by State, county, city. What I do with Jayn is try to show<br/>\nher relative monetary values - like saying something like, &quot;This toy costs<br/>\nthe same as three Barbies.&quot; It seems that &quot;value&quot; is something that can be<br/>\nunschooled by the simple expedient of giving an allowance string-free. <br/>\n<br/>\nDh and I keep talking about formulating a budget for the year, and<br/>\nallocating a certain amount to Jayn&#39;s toy purchases, along with the other<br/>\ncategories. At the moment these things go under &quot;miscellaneous&quot;, and I am<br/>\nonly rigorous about filing tax deductible and business expenses in separate<br/>\ncategories. For this reason I can&#39;t tell you how much we spend in a year or<br/>\na &quot;typical&quot; month on toys. Someone else mentioned the cyclic nature of their<br/>\nkid&#39;s desires. It felt familiar to me; I think Jayn is the same - especially<br/>\nwhen a new interest is first flowering. At the moment it is Winx Club (Fox).<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I start to feel uncomfortable about Jayn seeming acquisitive. It<br/>\nis probably a residual feeling similar to that which another poster is<br/>\nevidently in the full grip of - that giving your kids what they want is<br/>\n&quot;indulging&quot; them. I have come to the conclusion that when I am feeling that<br/>\nway it is because *I* am feeling martyred - *I* have not allowed *myself*<br/>\nsome indulgence of object or maybe time (eg to read for myself). It is a<br/>\nsense of it not being fair that I can&#39;t have all I want - although I<br/>\nactually can have *most* of what I want. Did I mention that those doubts are<br/>\nabout *ME*, not Jayn&#39;s character or desires? At these times I realize that I<br/>\nneed to engage in a little self care, and also to do some conscious blessing<br/>\ncounting. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen Jayn will do some selfless act that puts my mind at rest. Like choosing<br/>\nto give one of her dolls away to her friend for her birthday, a special doll<br/>\nno longer available in the stores that her friend has been admiring<br/>\nwistfully for months. Jayn&#39;s excitement and eagerness at the prospect of<br/>\ngiving the doll was only matched by the recipient&#39;s evident delight.<br/>\n <br/>\nRobyn L.

He had always wanted a<br/>\nsmall boat. Or maybe the mother wanted a flatscreen tv. She saw one at the<br/>\nstore recently and thought it was really fabulous. Or they both wanted to<br/>\ntake the family on vacation to Disney (that could easily cost $5,000 for a<br/>\nfamily of 4, with flights and accomodations); or to Australia or something?<br/>\nAll these things might be great, or awful, or receive thoroughly mixed<br/>\nreviews by family members. Why is it that when a child wants to spend that<br/>\nmuch on toys, it does not seem legitimate? In my example, $5000, is only 1%<br/>\nof $500,000.  In any given family, who gets to decide how to spend the money<br/>\nand why? Is it the parents because they make the money? Is it the parents<br/>\nbecause they are more rational? (When I was looking at the catalog with my<br/>\nchild, the things I liked or thought were interesting were much easier to<br/>\nconsider buying then something like a movie theatre size popcorn popper) So<br/>\nmuch rich dis cussion can happen about these desired things and if the money<br/>\nis really not a problem, why not buy things the child insists they want and<br/>\nsee what happens? We can never know what might be learned if we think we<br/>\nalready possess the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Leslie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I don&#39;t think instant gratification on hugs and love or feeding our<br/>\nbodies<br/>\n    is a problem.

Or maybe the mother wanted a flatscreen tv. She saw one at the store recently and thought it was really fabulous. Or they both wanted to take the family on vacation to Disney (that could easily cost $5,000 for a family of 4, with flights and accomodations); or to Australia or something? All these things might be great, or awful, or receive thoroughly mixed reviews by family members. Why is it that when a child wants to spend that much on toys, it does not seem legitimate? In my example, $5000, is only 1% of $500,000.  In any given family, who gets to decide how to spend the money and why? Is it the parents because they make the money? Is it the parents because they are more rational? (When I was looking at the catalog with my child, the things I liked or thought were interesting were much easier to consider buying then something like a movie theatre size popcorn popper) So much rich discussion can happen about these desired things and if the money is really not a problem, why not buy things the child insists they want and see what happens?

I inflated the amount of the money to stretch my thinking even further: how does one respond to &quot;abundance&quot;, how does a person, no matter what the age, know when they have enough? Why does it always seem that the more I get, the more I want? Would a child when given his equal or desired share, beable to figure out better what he wants if his desires are met? The child will likely make mistakes about what he wants. Why are mistakes with money, somehow seem worse than other kinds of mistakes? What if he spends $5000 on drum sets, archery stuff, ride on toys (like a car or tractor that they can drive around the yard), a cotton candy maker, a large trampoline, gumball and pinball machines, computer and video games, a swing set, lots of rokenbok and marble runs and all sorts of kinetic building toys (Those Back to Basic Toys really add up quickly :-)). Perhaps at a later age the child may say &quot;Why did you let me waste so much money?&quot; Or perhaps they might say, &quot;You trusted me to figure out what I like.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s my stuff: I would feel guilty that so many resources are used up by one child. Although I also know that whatever is not used could be donated to others.  I grew up pretty poor and given that I didn&#39;t have parents who had the belief that they could take my desires seriously, I want to give my kids what they ask for. Not without discussion, but perhaps without this panic feeling I have that all is going out of control when he has so many enthusiastic interests and desires!<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel, what you said below helps me.

He gets $4 per week because I<br/>\njust figured I would tie the amount to his age, and give him more as he gets<br/>\nolder. He does not have to do anything to earn the money - he just gets it<br/>\nas our way letting him participate in the prosperity of the family. He can<br/>\nspend it on anything he chooses even if I don&#39;t approve of it, and that&#39;s<br/>\nkind of the point. I periodically invest other money on his behalf for<br/>\npotential future purposes, but that&#39;s my choice, and I don&#39;t require him to<br/>\ndo it. If he wants to save his money, that is entirely up to him. We talk<br/>\nabout saving up for things - as in, it will take so many weeks to get enough<br/>\nmoney to buy that toy, but if he wants to blow it on something right now, he<br/>\ncan. I have no doubt that one day he will realize he can do more with his<br/>\nmoney if he saves it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to savings, I would ask your husband, what exactly are you saving<br/>\nit for? Can she ever spend it? Should she be expected to save money without<br/>\na clear purpose? If there is a purpose, is it something that is important to<br/>\nher, or something that is important to you? If it is important to you, why<br/>\nshould she be the one saving for it? My feeling is that enforcing savings is<br/>\nlike enforcing anything else - you are depriving the child of the<br/>\nopportunity to find out the value of out on her own, and really take it to<br/>\nheart. But - the bottom line for me is ownership. I am giving my child<br/>\nmoney, and if I am truly giving it, then he truly owns it, and I have no<br/>\nbusiness telling him what to do with it. The whole point of the exercise is<br/>\nto give him a sense of control, and that purpose is diminished, in my<br/>\nopinion, if there are strings attached.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":106579240,"authorName":"Lea Eaton","from":"Lea Eaton &lt;minwifeof4boys@...&gt;","profile":"minwifeof4boys","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] More money questions...","postDate":"1097191340","msgId":3434,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDA3MjMyMjIwLjg0NjU2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjIxMjA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDBJNTgwMDlJUUxPUlBYQGwtZGFlbW9uPg=="},"prevInTopic":3432,"nextInTopic":3435,"prevInTime":3433,"nextInTime":3435,"topicId":3424,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve tried to be very up front with our kiddos about money..

My dh feels that if<br/>\nwe are going to be giving allowances, then she should have half of it to<br/>\nspend and half must be put in a piggy bank to save, the point being somehow<br/>\nshe will learn how to save money from this enforced savings plan. Obviously<br/>\nI don&#39;t agree. We had a very civil conversation and have agreed to disagree<br/>\nand to do nothing at this time, but since I am the one that is out with her<br/>\non a more regular basis it does affect me more than him.

Our resources are not unlimited,<br/>\nbut we can support a fair-sized toy buying habit.  I used to arbitrarily<br/>\ncontrol what toys we bought, and have gradually come to understand how<br/>\ncompletely dh and I are the &#39;gateway&#39; for our kids to get things, and that<br/>\ngenerally dh and I were just buying whatever we wanted and then being<br/>\njudgmental when ds wanted things that we didn&#39;t see &quot;value&quot; in.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, I&#39;d say that my ds (now 5) definitely goes through periods where<br/>\nhe wants a lot more toys all of a sudden.  This happened over the summer<br/>\nwith Lego.  Every day he wanted more lego.  And now he has enough that he<br/>\ncan actually really enjoy building with it, and he hasn&#39;t mentioned new lego<br/>\nin months.  I firmly believe toys are tools, and that we may not be able to<br/>\nascertain from our perspective what the project is that they need the new<br/>\ntools for.  For a year or more he asked for new playmobil every day, and now<br/>\nhe&#39;s pretty much happy to just play with the playmobil he has.  I&#39;d never<br/>\nhave imagined that he&#39;d need so much of it to reach the place where he could<br/>\nplay the way he wanted, but apparently he did need that much.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I really grappled with how to both support his need for new toys<br/>\nand deal with the issues I had about buying so many toys.  The things I<br/>\nfound out were that I had old messages running inside of me about how kids<br/>\nneed to learn the value of money, how he&#39;d be &#39;spoiled&#39;  if we kept buying<br/>\nhim things, etc.  And I realized that I felt overwhelmed by the quantity of<br/>\nstuff coming in and needed a way to keep the toys better organized.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing I did was the process of uncovering my fears about buying him<br/>\nthe things he wanted, and how that related to my own money issues.  Also, I<br/>\nexplained to him a lot about relative costs of things, using trips to the<br/>\ntoy store as an opportunity to explore how much things cost.  We took Lego<br/>\nsets off the shelf and compared them, looking at the unique pieces and<br/>\nseeing how their play value related to their cost.  We spent a long time<br/>\nchoosing.  We had FUN at the store, instead of him whining and me being<br/>\nuptight.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;d say yes, buy him some stuff.  If it were me and my ds I would<br/>\nprobably figure out an amount that made sense in terms of what else we as a<br/>\nfamily wanted to use the money for.  I might also work with him to set up a<br/>\nschedule that made sense for making purchases, so he&#39;d have time to<br/>\nintegrate the new stuff into his world and see what he really wanted next.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really do believe that it is OK for kids to have lots of stuff, especially<br/>\nthe stuff they really want.  It just needs to make sense in the scheme of<br/>\nthe rest of the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel (also in MA :-))<br/>\n_________________________<br/>\nMy baby is a DiaperFreeBaby!!!<br/>\nwww.DiaperFreeBaby.org</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Another money &quot;problem&quot;","postDate":"1097185582","msgId":3428,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjNC4xZjBjMDQ3MC4yZTk3MTMyZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3427,"nextInTopic":3429,"prevInTime":3427,"nextInTime":3429,"topicId":3424,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This may seem like a no-brainer, but what if resources are not so  limited?
