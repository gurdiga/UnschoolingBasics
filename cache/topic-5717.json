But you as the mom are going to have to be<br/>\nthe one to turn things around.  It&#39;s too much for your kids.   Your kids<br/>\nwill mirror your attitude.  When your attitude changes you will begin to<br/>\nsee a change in your children.  It will take time though. <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now you feel neglected, ignored, disrespect, overwhelmed and *so do<br/>\nthey*. <br/>\n<br/>\nSpend time with your kids doing really pleasant things.  Snuggle them<br/>\nwhile they watch TV.  Smile at them, tell them you love them.  Tell them<br/>\nthings will get better.  Make their favorite thing to eat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;re going to do the dishes say &quot;I want to do these dishes so they<br/>\nwon&#39;t be in my way later when I make dinner.&quot; or whatever,  don&#39;t say<br/>\n&quot;Look at this mess, I&#39;m sick and tired of having to do everything around<br/>\nhere...&quot;    Be the helpful, patient, optimistic, caring person you&#39;re<br/>\nhoping your kids will one day be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nResist the urge to nag them.  If you&#39;d like help, ask when they&#39;re not<br/>\nengaged in something else.  If they say no, accept that and be sweet. <br/>\nYou will be modeling the kindness and patience they will adopt one day.  <br/>\nBe quick to help them when they ask for help from you.  It will make a<br/>\ndifference in how they think about helping. <br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone who is now a seasoned unschooler had to make adjustments to<br/>\ntheir thinking and expectations.  Everyone had things to workout in order<br/>\nto get to a great life.  But it&#39;s worth it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour kids love you and they want you to be happy.  They don&#39;t want to<br/>\nfeel badly and they don&#39;t want you to feel badly about them.  It&#39;s just<br/>\ntoo big a chasm for kids to climb out of on their own.  You have to be<br/>\nthe Sherpa. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n***Is it so wrong for mom to have her needs met as well? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nNot at all.  But it isn&#39;t right to expect our children to meet our needs.<br/>\n They&#39;re kids.  You have to meet them and you can choose to do that in a<br/>\nway that will hurt your relationship with your kids or in a way that will<br/>\nbuild it. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour ex husband really should be helping you, or he should get out and<br/>\nlet you give that room out in exchange for domestic help.   <br/>\n<br/>\nTry to get out once a week.  Go to a friends house for a couple of hours<br/>\nand just sit and drink tea.  Wander around a garden center.  Go feed<br/>\nducks.  Let your head get quiet. <br/>\n<br/>\nGo somewhere with your kids, just go out in the yard and dig a hole and<br/>\nfill it with water and play.  Ride your bikes to the Dairy Queen.  Go to<br/>\nthe park and play Frisbee.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLately you&#39;ve had unhappy times together and you need to replace them<br/>\nwith better ones.  <br/>\n<br/>\nChange your ideas about housework.  Do the minimum, do it when you feel<br/>\nlike it, don&#39;t think like a martyr, find ways to make the minimum easier.<br/>\n Really, paper plates have saved us during busy, stressful times.  Don&#39;t<br/>\nmake more work for yourself.   Be kind to yourself.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I can&#39;t deal with this chaos much longer***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe chaos starts in your head.   Dishes can be washed, even a big pile<br/>\ncan be done in an hour.  Washing machines and dryers do almost all the<br/>\nwork of laundry and clean clothes can sit in laundry baskets forever if<br/>\nthey have to.  <br/>\nI do dishes only when I want to.  I do them when everyone else is happily<br/>\nengaged in something they love.  I close the kitchen door, take off my<br/>\nshoes, light a candle, pour a glass of wine or a cup of tea, turn on some<br/>\nmusic.  I use soap that smells good and makes great bubbles.   It&#39;s an<br/>\nhour my mind can wander anywhere it wants.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck Michelle.

The two youngest are in charge <br/>\nof<br/>\nthe family room, the 10 year old gets the dining room, the 11 y/o gets <br/>\nthe<br/>\nkitchen, and the 15 y/o gets the bathrooms and hall.  Plus the 15 y/o<br/>\n&quot;floats,&quot;  helping the younger children when needed.   Being in charge <br/>\nof a<br/>\nroom means everything from picking up, dusting, wiping down walls and<br/>\nfurniture, sweeping/mopping/vacuuming the floors...the works.   Although<br/>\nthey don&#39;t have to do everything everyday.  For example, the furniture <br/>\nis<br/>\ndusted once a week, and cabinets and walls are wiped down once a month. <br/>\n And<br/>\nthey get to pick what days to do it.

I <br/>\nbet your child would avoid it---and tell you that it wasn&#39;t *his* job.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis reminds me of the story Joyce tells: She has spilt milk and bent <br/>\nover to clean it up.

I <br/>\nprobably<br/>\nhaven&#39;t done dishes over a dozen times in the past 6 years. My oldest<br/>\nstarted doing them when he was 9 and as others got older they started<br/>\nhelping.  Now the 11 year old does them, with occasional help....from<br/>\nsibling, though, not from me.  Don&#39;t be afraid to not do them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nReally bad parenting advice. They are NOT slaves!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n If there are<br/>\nno clean pots/pans when it comes dinner time, then obviously you can&#39;t <br/>\nmake<br/>\ndinner &lt;grin&gt;.  If dinner is made, but there are no plates, flatware or<br/>\nglasses, wash ONLY one setting...yours.

What works <br/>\nin the<br/>\nmilitary (I am an AF Veteran married to an active duty Army Soldier - <br/>\ncurrently<br/>\nin Baghdad for a year) is cracking down hard at first.  Make it far <br/>\nstricter<br/>\nthan it needs to be.  You can always let up a bit later but it is very <br/>\nhard to<br/>\nstart lenient and then get stricter.  Human nature doesn&#39;t work that <br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI truly hope no one&#39;s taking this seriously on this list. This is awful <br/>\nunschooling advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also married to a member of the military. Ben&#39;s a lieutenant <br/>\ncolonel in the Air Force.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut our family is NOT the military. Our family is a ...well....FAMILY! <br/>\nWe don&#39;t &quot;crack down&quot; on anything, We work together as a cohesive <br/>\ngroup---because we love each other and want the best for each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI have recently started cracking down and pushing patterns.  Things are <br/>\nstarting<br/>\nto take shape.  No more eating or drinking in the living room.  You <br/>\nwant to eat?<br/>\nEat at the table.  You don&#39;t want to eat what I fixed?  Fine.  You <br/>\ndon&#39;t eat<br/>\n(trust me, they will not starve by missing an occasional meal).  Our <br/>\nnew saying<br/>\naround here is &quot;Mom is not a short-order cook.&quot;  You want to play video <br/>\ngames?<br/>\nHere&#39;s the timer.  You get 30 min a day.  You choose when.  You want <br/>\nlunch?<br/>\nSorry, no lunch until the toys are picked up.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren behave EXACTLY as they are treated. I hope that these children <br/>\nfind kinder hearts somewhere else so that they don&#39;t treat their <br/>\nchildren---or their old, feeble parents!--- this way in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a child, wouldn&#39;t you rather be treated with kindness and <br/>\ngenerosity? *I* would. I think we need to model the behavior we&#39;d like <br/>\nto see in our children.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do allowances - one dollar per year of age.  If you do not do your <br/>\nexpected<br/>\nhousehold responsibilities (not chores), you lose money (conversely, <br/>\nyou go<br/>\nabove and beyond, you gain money).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWe give our children pocket money. That money is not tied to chores or <br/>\nthe euphemistic &quot;responsibilities&quot;---and if they need something and I <br/>\nhave a few extra bucks, I&#39;m willing to share. Oddly, when I&#39;m short, <br/>\nthey&#39;re more than willing to help me out financially. And Cameron (17) <br/>\nhas more money than I do right now!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe sitting down with the kids and explaining in a calm tone of voice <br/>\nthat you<br/>\nare all in this together.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nGood idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did that. I have no problem washing dishes and washing and folding <br/>\nclothes, but I hate to put them away. Cameron loves to do this! Yippee! <br/>\nWe can work together and neither does what s/he hates. When Cam isn&#39;t <br/>\nhere or when I&#39;m busy with other things, we&#39;re willing to help the <br/>\nother out even with those things we don&#39;t love to do. Because we know <br/>\nthat it&#39;s a nice thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a list ready... Who wants to wash dishes?  No<br/>\none?  OK, so we&#39;ll all take turns - one person each day and mark it on <br/>\na<br/>\ncalendar.  Anyone want to do the vacuuming?  No?  OK, the oldest does <br/>\nthis.<br/>\nDusting?  No?  Just assign if no one volunteers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYUCK!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf treated as real people, not as people-to-be, they will eventually be <br/>\neager to help. A sure-fire way to get them to hate to clean is to force <br/>\nit---just like with learning!<br/>\n<br/>\nMine volunteer to do things without my even asking. They see things <br/>\nthat should be done and pitch in. Because we&#39;re a family, not a <br/>\nmilitary operation, where no one wants to take the responsibility. And <br/>\nhousehold stuff gets done because everyone would rather live in a clean <br/>\nhome and none of the &quot;chores&quot; are considered negative.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n If they want something, see if their list is completed first.  It<br/>\ngoes without saying, no TV until their beds are made and teeth are <br/>\nbrushed.  If<br/>\nyou can&#39;t walk through their room from the mess, no going out with <br/>\nfriends or<br/>\nwhatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThey will learn that none of these things are pleasurable. They will <br/>\nbecome things to be avoided at all costs. They will also know you are a <br/>\ndictator and to *also* be avoided.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nKids crave routine.  Kids crave structure.  Kids crave boundaries.<br/>\nThey will push and push as far as they can to see just where the <br/>\nboundary is.<br/>\nWhen I acted like a martyr, nothing happened.

Kids crave honesty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey will push and push and push if there *IS* a boundary. No boundary? <br/>\nNo pushing!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a mom acts like a martyr, a child learns to treat her that way. <br/>\nWhen a mom acts like a dictator, a child learns to treat her that way. <br/>\nWhen a mom *is* a partner, so is the child.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDo take some time for yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is important. You simply ask for some quiet time. With tiny <br/>\nchildren, you may need to get some help from a friend or relative. But <br/>\nyou can know that this time is short and won&#39;t last forever. They grow <br/>\nup soooo fast. It&#39;s not long before they&#39;re driving and out for weeks <br/>\nat a time (I&#39;m missing Cameron right now because he&#39;s been <br/>\nhouse-sitting for two weeks. At the end of this week, he leaves for Not <br/>\nBack To School Camp for a week. Time flies, y&#39;all!

As Moms, we tend to give and <br/>\ngive and<br/>\ngive until our well is dry.  When there is no one there to refill it <br/>\nfor us, we<br/>\nmust do it for ourselves or we will not be able to help those most <br/>\nimportant to<br/>\nus.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds like a combination of Dr Phil and John Rosemond. Avoid both <br/>\nthose men!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s very hard to reject the traditional parenting that we were raised <br/>\nwith and that is so prevalent in our society, but it&#39;s not impossible. <br/>\nFind people who are practice peaceful, respectful parenting and hang <br/>\nout with them. Spend a lot of time here on this list where we respect <br/>\nand trust children. Just be nicer to your kids! They&#39;re worth it!

Some<br/>\nchildren do better with a little structure.  I&#39;m not saying that they <br/>\nhave to do<br/>\nmath from 8-9, but you could set goals for them to do each day.  This, <br/>\nof<br/>\ncourse, can include chores.  For instance, you could say that A,B,C <br/>\ngets done<br/>\nbefore lunch.  Or you could say that X,Y,Z gets done before free time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day I was so distressed, I stormed out and left my chore reluctant <br/>\n13 and 14<br/>\nyear olds home.  I was tired of their complaining about helping out.  I <br/>\ntold<br/>\nthem to have the house cleaned before I got back or the computer was <br/>\ngetting<br/>\npacked up.  And they did!  Of course, I called before I came home to <br/>\ncheck on<br/>\nthem (and to make sure it was done :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d recommend breathing deeply. A lot. And asking for help. Be prepared <br/>\nfor &quot;no&quot; as the answer; but if your children know you really need help, <br/>\nI can&#39;t imagine their not helping.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless, of course, you&#39;ve been requiring chores so far in their lives. <br/>\nIf that&#39;s the case, then they need time to heal and to begin trusting <br/>\nyou again. You might want to make things a bit easier for a while by <br/>\nmaybe using paper plates, etc . Or bins in the family room to toss toys <br/>\nin.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nEither find something to motivate them or make it mandatory.  Find what<br/>\nmotivates them and make that their goal.  First they have to get X <br/>\ndone.  Or<br/>\njust make it that they have to do X no matter what.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNononono! NOT on an unschooling list!!! Make it appealing. Ask for <br/>\ntheir help. Do it WITH them! Just DO &quot;X&quot; yourself if it&#39;s necessary to <br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr hire a maid. Your children were NOT put here to be your <br/>\nmaids/servants---even if *you* were treated that way as a child! Treat <br/>\nthem they way you wish *you* had been treated!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no reason for you to be the maid.  Your children are old <br/>\nenough to<br/>\nclean up after themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, threre&#39;s even LESS of a reason for your children to be maids!!! <br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t your children&#39;s choices to be born into your family. It was <br/>\nyour decision to have them. They&#39;re not responsible for your <br/>\nhousekeeping. They didn&#39;t get to choose your house or furniture. They <br/>\ncan&#39;t decide to move into a smaller, more efficient house!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Old enough&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anything. My children are &quot;old enough&quot; to do <br/>\nall sorts of things. I still read to my nine-year-old and tie his <br/>\nshoes. I still wash my 17-year-old&#39;s clothes and fix him breakfast. I <br/>\nclean their rooms, scratch their heads, and happily take them where <br/>\nthey need to go. Ya&#39; know what? They will do those same things for me. <br/>\nI do those things for my husband too! Age has nothing to do with it. <br/>\nGenerosity DOES. The more *honestly* generous you are, the more <br/>\ngenerous they&#39;ll become.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s more important to do things because you WANT to. I cheerfully fold <br/>\nlaundry and wash dishes. While I&#39;m doing those things, I&#39;ll think about <br/>\nhow happy I am that they&#39;re part of my life and that we have clothes to <br/>\nwear and food to eat. Look for the GOOD in your &quot;chores&quot; and you may <br/>\nfind that they&#39;re not so awful.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling does not mean no rules either.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it does.

My children have made agreements with me and in turn I make <br/>\nagreements with them and we try - mostly- to live in harmony and respect <br/>\neach others belongings and space.  I don&#39;t agree that a13 year old is not <br/>\ncapable of helping out either but I would not ask a child to do what I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do myself.

Consider these","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2127198211\">It sounds more like a family dynamics issue than an unschooling problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, take it easy on yourself, you&#39;ve been through a hurricane.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider these things: <br/>\nWhether putting your kids in school would solve any of your current<br/>\nproblems.  There would still be hurricane mess to clean up.  There would<br/>\nstill be an ex who isn&#39;t helping you.  There would still be a boil order<br/>\non the water.  (hope that&#39;s lifted by now)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus you&#39;d have the stress of getting kids up in time for school, the<br/>\nexpense of school supplies and school clothes, etc.  You&#39;d have the<br/>\nstress of helping three kids with homework every night and bedtime issues<br/>\ntimes three. <br/>\n<br/>\nWill kids who&#39;ve been in school for six or more hours each day and who<br/>\nhave two or more hours of homework each night be any more willing/able to<br/>\nhelp you? <br/>\n<br/>\nTell your ex husband he needs to help.  He has as much responsibility to<br/>\nprovide a good, safe, reasonably clean, harmonious living atmosphere for<br/>\nhis kids as you do. <br/>\n<br/>\nNext, if you can&#39;t do dishes and your kids can&#39;t or won&#39;t yet, get paper<br/>\nplates, plastic disposable cups and utensils and use them.  Save everyone<br/>\nthe stress. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a waste basket in every room?  Is there a clothes hamper in the<br/>\nbathroom?  Would it help you to put more waste baskets and hampers<br/>\naround?  <br/>\n<br/>\nPut a whisk broom and dust pan in every room and you won&#39;t have to run<br/>\nback for a broom when you see crumbs. <br/>\n<br/>\nGet some storage bins or baskets for every room in the house.  When you<br/>\nwant to pick stuff up it can go into a bin.  You&#39;ll have the satisfaction<br/>\nof getting it off the floor/furniture but not the bother of finding out<br/>\nwhere it goes and taking it there.   And when a kid asks if you saw it<br/>\nyou&#39;ll likely remember where it is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nString or canvas shopping bags hung on door nobs are a great place to<br/>\nstash toys or books if you want to get the floor picked up quickly. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese things might also help your kids because picking up will only take<br/>\na moment and not interfere with what they were doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you required chores before I&#39;m not surprised your kids are reluctant<br/>\nto help you.  I know it&#39;s hard but this is human nature.  It&#39;s human<br/>\nnature to resist power that seems to want to zap you of your autonomy. <br/>\nIn time they will see the benefits of helping out, but now it just looks<br/>\nlike torture to them.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is important, if *you* are stressed out, exhausted and feeling<br/>\nawful about all the work you are showing them that work is pure drudgery.<br/>\n No intelligent child would willingly take on a job that even his/her<br/>\nmother cannot cope with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis comes back to family dynamics.  If you&#39;re depressed - and after all<br/>\nyou&#39;ve been through I wouldn&#39;t be surprised- if you&#39;re depressed your<br/>\nkids are going to reflect that.  It&#39;s going to become the atmosphere of<br/>\nyour house so you might think about taking care of yourself, getting<br/>\nhelp, finding someone to talk to, whatever you can.   You&#39;ll have to make<br/>\na deliberate decision every day, maybe every moment,  to change the<br/>\nenergy of your home if you want your kids to feel better and more<br/>\npositive too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you get someone to help you get your house in order?  Can you call a<br/>\nfriend?  Just to make a start and help you not feel so overwhelmed. <br/>\nSomeone from your church?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know you said your kids are old enough to help but really, they are<br/>\nyoung.  It is not reasonable to expect even a thirteen year old to be<br/>\nable to handle stuff his/her mom can&#39;t seem to.  If it seems out of<br/>\ncontrol to you - it&#39;s your house, your world - how must it seem to your<br/>\nkids?  If you don&#39;t know where to start or what to do next it&#39;s not<br/>\nreasonable to expect them to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think what seems to you like unwillingness to help or cooperate<br/>\nmight be the symptoms of the stress of a major storm, major disruption to<br/>\ntheir lives and a mom who&#39;s feeling hopeless and angry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be ok.  These things pass, and when you can start feeling better<br/>\nyou&#39;ll be able to start seeing positive things about your kids and family<br/>\nagain.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help you to write five nice things about each kid.  Just write<br/>\nthem down and send it to the list, or put it in your pocket.  It will<br/>\nchange the way you feel next time you look at your kids and that&#39;s will<br/>\nhelp in lots of ways.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158812614,"authorName":"Sherry Upson","from":"&quot;Sherry Upson&quot; &lt;kupson@...&gt;","profile":"alohagagirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: A somewhat reluctant post","postDate":"1121812725","msgId":5732,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMjEwMWM1OGNiMiQ5ZjkzMTExMCQ0NTIwYmY0MUBVcHNvbkZhbWlseT4=","referencesHeader":"PGRiamhqZStsbm1lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5731,"nextInTopic":5733,"prevInTime":5731,"nextInTime":5733,"topicId":5717,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I, too, believe strongly in a routine.

Children crave routines and boundaries.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGetting up near the same time and going to bed near the same time every day is a good start.  I try to work in the interest of the moment . . . right now, it is Guitar lessons and Swim lessons.  We weave our days around the scheduled moments.  My biggest routine for him is (since the weather here is unbearably hot and humid) going out right after breakfast and playing in the backyard for a while.  Then we usually do some TV - his current favorite is Magic School Bus - to chill out (and cool down! :) ).  He helps with lunch.  I do make him pick up his toys before lunch and before bed.  I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with expecting him to help keep the house in order.  I am teaching him about life, right?  No one else is going to run around behind him picking up in life, so why should I?  My goal as a mother is to work myself out of a job!  If he has an especially big project, he can leave it out, as long as it is out of the main flow of traffic and it is neat.  He has responsibilities, too.  Making bed, picking up toys, cleaning kitty litter boxes, taking out trash, cleaning guinea pig cages... I do believe that having kids work WITH you is a very good idea!  Life is not all fun and games (drats!)  (Soapbox Moment coming up...)  I believe that kids today have too little responsibility when growing up and then have a very hard time adjusting to life after mom and dad.  If they work with you, they learn not only How to do a job, but that the job must be done.  They learn that just because mommy can&#39;t play with them right now doesn&#39;t mean that mommy is off playing somewhere else!  Besides, if you start them young enough, they LOVE to help (in my experience).  Even if it is just setting the table or putting away the silverware... they want to spend time with you and will do just about anything to accomplish it!  Just my two cents...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: alisonmbr <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, July 19, 2005 2:42 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: A somewhat reluctant post<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I reply hesitantly because I am a new homeschooler -- my kids are 5, <br/>\n  3 and 1, but I have a few thoughts for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One thought is to simplify.

I apologize to Jayn at once. <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead I try to express the issue as my feelings and needs. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Do you know about FlyLady (www.flylady.net)? <br/>\nShe has a page up right now on getting kids to work with you on <br/>\nhousework. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always liked her, but will change my mind if she is including that<br/>\nstrategy in her lexicon.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We&#39;re out of a routine for the summer, and I find it a bit <br/>\nuncomfortable. I&#39;m thinking for the fall that we&#39;ll have one day <br/>\nwhen we try to have music in our life, one day we definitely try to <br/>\nget outside, one day when we&#39;ll make an extra effort do art, one day <br/>\nto go to the library, etc. Not that those things won&#39;t be options on <br/>\nother days, but a rough schedule will give us some kind of routine <br/>\nto use as a springboard. The other thing I&#39;d like to do is read <br/>\naloud every day. My thought is that I&#39;d do shower, breakfast, etc, <br/>\nthen some housework, and around 10 we&#39;ll do a story.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLot&#39;s of &quot;I&quot; in this. What are your *kids&#39;* into?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy wait until Fall to do interesting things? Unschooling does not care<br/>\nabout school vacations or setting our timetables around the schools&#39;, and I<br/>\nhave noticed that there is actually more going on around my area over summer<br/>\nbecause of the camps and things, and special days at museums and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if your kids want to be still asleep at 10, or would prefer to do art<br/>\nor some other thing? Jayn is 5.5 like your eldest and very clear about her<br/>\ndesires and able to fill up her time. I don&#39;t try to enforce my notions of a<br/>\nroutine on to her, although I have a household routine that works for *me*,<br/>\nand she asks for different things including spending most of the day reading<br/>\nstories to her sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Our unschoolers are 15, 11, 10, 8 and 6.  We&#39;ve also<br/>\nnoticed that the messier the house is, the more the children bicker and<br/>\nargue among themselves....even the 8 y/o has commented on this (said it<br/>\nmakes him nervous when things are messy).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we&#39;ve finally found that is working for us is to have assign rooms,<br/>\nwith the children to pick which rooms.  The two youngest are in charge of<br/>\nthe family room, the 10 year old gets the dining room, the 11 y/o gets the<br/>\nkitchen, and the 15 y/o gets the bathrooms and hall.  Plus the 15 y/o<br/>\n&quot;floats,&quot;  helping the younger children when needed.   Being in charge of a<br/>\nroom means everything from picking up, dusting, wiping down walls and<br/>\nfurniture, sweeping/mopping/vacuuming the floors...the works.   Although<br/>\nthey don&#39;t have to do everything everyday.  For example, the furniture is<br/>\ndusted once a week, and cabinets and walls are wiped down once a month.  And<br/>\nthey get to pick what days to do it.  So far, this has been working out<br/>\ngreat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are also responsible for their own bedrooms, however that is done on<br/>\ntheir own time, after their assigned rooms.  I&#39;m not too big on the<br/>\ncondition of their bedrooms, as THEY are the ones that have to live in<br/>\nthem...and I can always close the door &lt;grin&gt;   Turns out, for the most<br/>\npart, they keep their rooms fairly straight (which is a bit of a surprise!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI cook (sometimes) and sort/wash the laundry, but the children fold and put<br/>\naway.  And if it&#39;s not in the hamper, it doesn&#39;t get washed.  It only took<br/>\none time for them to miss an outing because they didn&#39;t have clean clothes<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the biggest problems we have is clutter.  You can&#39;t organize<br/>\nclutter, no matter how many storage boxes you have....believe me, I KNOW, as<br/>\nI am one of the world&#39;s worst clutter-bugs.  However with the help of<br/>\nFLYLady ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flylady.org\">http://www.flylady.org</a> ), I am making major progress.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncost anything, and it can&#39;t hurt to try...or in my case, try and try and try<br/>\nagain. LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so much that unschooling isn&#39;t working, it&#39;s that<br/>\nyou are trying to be housekeeper, dishwasher, laundress, lawn maintenance,<br/>\nteacher, etc.  Any of which...by itself...is a full time job.  I probably<br/>\nhaven&#39;t done dishes over a dozen times in the past 6 years. My oldest<br/>\nstarted doing them when he was 9 and as others got older they started<br/>\nhelping.  Now the 11 year old does them, with occasional help....from<br/>\nsibling, though, not from me.  Don&#39;t be afraid to not do them.  If there are<br/>\nno clean pots/pans when it comes dinner time, then obviously you can&#39;t make<br/>\ndinner &lt;grin&gt;.  If dinner is made, but there are no plates, flatware or<br/>\nglasses, wash ONLY one setting...yours.  I&#39;ve found it is a very rare<br/>\noccasion indeed when there are no clean dishes in the house :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if any of this helps any, but it&#39;s what has been working for<br/>\nour family.<br/>\n<br/>\n~S~</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":215374800,"authorName":"herbshed","from":"&quot;herbshed&quot; &lt;herbshed@...&gt;","profile":"herbshed","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Documentation question","postDate":"1121449506","msgId":5731,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE1BQkJMT0pLTkpKTkJBSU1OSEVIT0VESUtDQUIuaGVyYnNoZWRAaG90cG9wLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRiNWlidStoNm5rQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5730,"nextInTopic":5732,"prevInTime":5730,"nextInTime":5732,"topicId":5717,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My children have started acting at the local theatre.

Check out SCA, 4-H, horse-back riding, pottery, dog training, whatever but help the kids get a life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond---you get a life.  Find your passion.  What have you always secretly wanted to do?  Go do it.  Perhaps bellydancing, karate, crochet, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird---Have a meeting of the minds with your kids.  I am not saying &quot;lay down the law&quot; but make yourself heard.  Get input from everyone.  Make a plan.  Listen to feedback.  Tweak things if necessary.  If someone in the family is so upset by how things are that they are hiding in their room, something needs to give.  If one of your kids was that upset on an ongoing basis, you would do what you could to help them feel better.  Do the same for yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have 5 children.  Dh travels a lot with work and is a volunteer fireman.

I run several groups (4-H, unschooling) and study witchcraft.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids know that I will go way, way out on a limb to help them do what they want.  If there is any way I can do for them what they want I will.  I expect them to at least help straighten the house and I tell them so.  I have even been known to say &quot;I just spent an entire day outside in 100 degree weather so you could go to a shooting competition and you aren&#39;t willing to help me by watching your younger sister for 20 minutes?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is easy to start to take things for granted.  And it isn&#39;t just my kids, dh can get caught up in his life and forget that I am a fully functioning human being as well.  Balance is important.

What happens when unschooling isn&#39;t <br/>\n  working for mom?  When we first started this venture I kept waiting <br/>\n  for some sort of rhythm to form.  A groove.  A pattern.  But what I <br/>\n  am finding is actually what feels like chaos.  There are days that I <br/>\n  feel that I am drowning in the chaos.  I&#39;ve found myself on more <br/>\n  than one day hiding in my bedroom behind a book just so I can ignore <br/>\n  the chaos.  And there is growing apathy.  No one cares that the <br/>\n  bathroom is a mess or that there is crap all over the floor.  I&#39;m <br/>\n  sick of walking into a room that I have just cleaned to find that it <br/>\n  is now filled with empty food wrappers, crumbs, clothes, and toys.  <br/>\n  It doesn&#39;t bother them at all that it is like that either.  And <br/>\n  asking them to help is like pulling hen&#39;s teeth.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  This has all sort of come to a boiling point while dealing with the <br/>\n  hurricane this week.  No one wanted to help prepare, find dirty <br/>\n  clothes to wash, pack in case we evacuated, tidy the living room for <br/>\n  the people who were sheltering with us, or even get out of said <br/>\n  living room so I could clean it.  Now looking at the growing <br/>\n  mountain of debris that needs to be cleaned from the yard, the new <br/>\n  pile of laundry, the filthy floors from mud and grime being tracked <br/>\n  in, the pile of dishes still waiting to be done as soon as the boil <br/>\n  order is lifted, they are much more content to just sit in the house <br/>\n  and watch television.  The 3 days we were without power were filled <br/>\n  with whining and complaining and wishing that the television was <br/>\n  working.  Every suggestion that I brought up to entertain ourselves <br/>\n  was shot down with &quot;that&#39;s boring, not now, that&#39;s lame, no way.&quot;  <br/>\n  Yet when I asked for suggestions it was always things like, &quot;Well, <br/>\n  couldn&#39;t you go to the store and buy a battery operated television&quot; <br/>\n  or &quot;Can&#39;t we drive over to Uncle D&#39;s house where he has power so we <br/>\n  can watch his television and get on the internet?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m tired.  I&#39;m tired of doing all the laundry, all the dishes, all <br/>\n  the cooking, all the cleaning when I have children who are old <br/>\n  enough and capable enough to help (almost 13, almost 10 and 7).  I <br/>\n  gave up doling out chores over a year ago and now only ask when I <br/>\n  truly need help like when my hands are full and I need the door <br/>\n  open.  Sometimes I stand at the door getting angrier and angrier <br/>\n  because no one is willing to walk 10 feet to open a door for me.  To <br/>\n  get off their butts and pull themselves away from what they are <br/>\n  doing for 5 seconds to open a door for someone whose hands are full <br/>\n  of laundry or groceries.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m essentially a single parent.  My ex-husband lives with us and <br/>\n  there are many days when he leaves at 6 am and doesn&#39;t come home <br/>\n  until 10 pm.  He&#39;s mostly a renter.  So there is no &quot;honey will you <br/>\n  do ________&quot; for me.  He&#39;s not even here to help with post hurricane <br/>\n  clean up because of the nature of his job.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I seek to find those &quot;shining moments of unschooling&quot; and they seem <br/>\n  so few and far between or are clouded over with the pessimism, <br/>\n  apathy and selfishness that seems to be abounding in this house.  Is <br/>\n  it so wrong for mom to have her needs met as well?  Is there someway <br/>\n  to create order in unschooling?  I can&#39;t deal with this chaos much <br/>\n  longer and even had the very bad thought that if my kids were in <br/>\n  public school at least I could have a clean house a few hours a day <br/>\n  without it meaning me working the entire time they are awake.  Is <br/>\n  unschooling really healthy for a family when mom is cowering in a <br/>\n  corner in her room wishing that the world would just freeze for 15 <br/>\n  minutes?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Michelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

I am not a seasoned expert like some of the folks on here, but would like to offer some ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds to me like the problem isn&#39;t the unschooling but the structure.  I have found in my own life that disorderly patterns and bad habits form easily.  I have ADD and suffer from depression / grief.  It is much harder (it will take about a month) to form positive patterns.  It will take a month of your being the General of your little Army for them to fall in line.  What works in the military (I am an AF Veteran married to an active duty Army Soldier - currently in Baghdad for a year) is cracking down hard at first.  Make it far stricter than it needs to be.  You can always let up a bit later but it is very hard to start lenient and then get stricter.  Human nature doesn&#39;t work that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have recently started cracking down and pushing patterns.  Things are starting to take shape.  No more eating or drinking in the living room.  You want to eat?  Eat at the table.  You don&#39;t want to eat what I fixed?  Fine.  You don&#39;t eat (trust me, they will not starve by missing an occasional meal).  Our new saying around here is &quot;Mom is not a short-order cook.&quot;  You want to play video games?  Here&#39;s the timer.  You get 30 min a day.  You choose when.  You want lunch?  Sorry, no lunch until the toys are picked up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do allowances - one dollar per year of age.  If you do not do your expected household responsibilities (not chores), you lose money (conversely, you go above and beyond, you gain money).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe sitting down with the kids and explaining in a calm tone of voice that you are all in this together.  Have a list ready... Who wants to wash dishes?  No one?  OK, so we&#39;ll all take turns - one person each day and mark it on a calendar.  Anyone want to do the vacuuming?  No?  OK, the oldest does this.  Dusting?  No?  Just assign if no one volunteers.  Tell them that you will reassess in a week and do some chore swapping if necessary.  Spend a few minutes and write down and post - for each child - a daily list of what exactly is expected.  If they want something, see if their list is completed first.  It goes without saying, no TV until their beds are made and teeth are brushed.  If you can&#39;t walk through their room from the mess, no going out with friends or whatever.  Kids crave routine.  Kids crave structure.  Kids crave boundaries.  They will push and push as far as they can to see just where the boundary is.  When I acted like a martyr, nothing happened.  When I became General Mommy, this place started to take shape.  It takes a LOT of concentrated effort on my part, too.  I sort mail over the trashcan.  I shred credit card offers immediately.  I put the bills in one place.  Dishes are done before I get to go to bed (I am the only one old enough to trust with those).  I am not a naturally organized person.  But, knowing and honestly facing my weaknesses and making the decision to set a good example for my family helps, as does constant prayer!<br/>\n<br/>\nDo take some time for yourself.  Set the timer and put it outside of your bedroom door.  Tell the kids they are not to interrupt you before the timer goes off unless they are bleeding or on fire!  As Moms, we tend to give and give and give until our well is dry.  When there is no one there to refill it for us, we must do it for ourselves or we will not be able to help those most important to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease know that I am not trying to preach (although I am really good at lectures and guilt trips - another thing I&#39;m working on...) but I see a lot of me in your post.  I am currently on anti-depressants and when I remember to take them like I should life is much better and I have the ability to stay strong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be praying for you as you work to get things under control.  It&#39;s not easy, but you CAN do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry<br/>\nOur Family<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":155078101,"authorName":"Cathy","from":"&quot;Cathy&quot; &lt;cathyirene@...&gt;","profile":"desdemona521","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] A somewhat reluctant post","postDate":"1121346627","msgId":5729,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjUwMWM1ODg3NSQ2N2I2OWZhMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBNb3JlTWFnYXppbmVzPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRiNGQ2ZCtyNDY3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5727,"nextInTopic":5730,"prevInTime":5728,"nextInTime":5730,"topicId":5717,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, Michelle, From my experience, I would say that unschooling doesn t have to be chaos.

Some children do better with a little structure.  I&#39;m not saying that they have to do math from 8-9, but you could set goals for them to do each day.  This, of course, can include chores.  For instance, you could say that A,B,C gets done before lunch.  Or you could say that X,Y,Z gets done before free time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne day I was so distressed, I stormed out and left my chore reluctant 13 and 14 year olds home.  I was tired of their complaining about helping out.  I told them to have the house cleaned before I got back or the computer was getting packed up.  And they did!  Of course, I called before I came home to check on them (and to make sure it was done :)<br/>\n<br/>\nEither find something to motivate them or make it mandatory.  Find what motivates them and make that their goal.  First they have to get X done.  Or just make it that they have to do X no matter what.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no reason for you to be the maid.  Your children are old enough to clean up after themselves.  Unschooling does not mean no rules either.  For instance, perhaps there is no eating out of the kitchen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would try adding a little more structure before hauling them back to public school.  It might not take a lot and it may work.<br/>\n~Cathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223824288,"authorName":"waltonc32927","from":"&quot;waltonc32927&quot; &lt;waltonc32927@...&gt;","profile":"waltonc32927","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: A somewhat reluctant post","postDate":"1121340606","msgId":5721,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRiNWlidStoNm5rQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRiNGQ2ZCtyNDY3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5720,"nextInTopic":5722,"prevInTime":5720,"nextInTime":5722,"topicId":5717,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Michelle, I write to you this morning with dirty dishes at my side and sand under my feet, the computer room is my teenaged unschoolers laboratory.

They have realised that it is in everyone&#39;s best interest to clean up after themselves  They don&#39;t always do it but when it is not done I point it out.  I refuse to be a maid.  I will help along with them but that is all. I see that them learning to clean up and tidy is part of life skills.  The youngest two do nothing but they have not got to that stage yet.  I have boxes, storage and bins available in every room to put away toys, craft stuff, books and rubbish. I don&#39;t make them do it but they see the benefit of knowing where their stuf is and not tripping over it.  Same on an evening. I feel me an dh needs some space. I asked them what they thought to this and they all decided they would read, watch T.V or play on the computer upstairs from about 8 or 9 ish. It is not a rule - if they want to stay down they can but generally they go up and play.I don&#39;t actually think your problem is unschooling it is your kids  attitudes. They would have been like that even if in school.  That is what you need to address. How do your kids feel about their dad been a renter now in your home?  Are they upset by this?

I <br/>\n&gt; gave up doling out chores over a year ago and now<br/>\n&gt; only ask when I <br/>\n&gt; truly need help like when my hands are full and I<br/>\n&gt; need the door <br/>\n&gt; open.
