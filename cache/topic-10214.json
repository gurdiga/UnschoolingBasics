Making it a non issue!  Making<br/>\n&gt; exercise fun and doing it just for fun... not exercise.  The whole family<br/>\n&gt; needs to get out and get active.  Why is this Dr&#39;s orders?  Also, make <br/>\n&gt; sure<br/>\n&gt; that the family also changes their diet.  Limit the junk food and have<br/>\n&gt; healthy choices abound.  She&#39;s 10, she&#39;s 10, she&#39;s 10.  She&#39;ll carry food<br/>\n&gt; issues for the rest of her life if it&#39;s not dropped now.  Your dd is only<br/>\n&gt; one part of a whole family... so the family is going to make changes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree so much !!   I am a member of the &quot;clean your plate club&quot;.  My mom <br/>\nonce made me sit at the table until I finished my stewed tomatoes (which was <br/>\nmy dad&#39;s favorite).  It was 11pm & she finally took the bowl, put it in the <br/>\nfridge & said I could eat it for breakfast ( guess what ? I didnt eat <br/>\nbreakfast ).   I have had food issues all my adult life.<br/>\nThere are people who will tell you - you&#39;re an adult & you make your own <br/>\nchoices-  but it starts really early in life.  My kids kindly call me <br/>\n&quot;squishy&quot; not fat but I am very over weight.  I have made it a point not to <br/>\nmake food an issue with my kids, especially my dd.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd by the way .............. to this day I can&#39;t eat anything that has even <br/>\nthe smallest chunk of stewed tomatoes in it !!<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol - who&#39;s Mom is totally different now, especially with her grandkids, <br/>\nbetter late than never.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10209,"nextTopicId":10217}}
