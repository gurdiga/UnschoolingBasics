They can learn the formal<br/>\nlanguage *way* faster the more real life grammar they absorb and use.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe BEST way to help your children grasp grammar is to USE proper <br/>\ngrammar!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a grammar nazi---it&#39;s important to me that my boys don&#39;t <br/>\nsound...um....South Carolinian (to get back to the state reference <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;). I want them to understand how to use adverbs and when to use the <br/>\nobjective case. I HATE to hear the &quot;to him and I&quot; that&#39;s sooo common in <br/>\nvernacular. It just sends me reeling!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I do my little freak-out when a news anchor says something so <br/>\nblatantly wrong. Worse is when I find it PUBLISHED somewhere---I just <br/>\nwant to scream, &quot;Where was the editor???&quot; I&#39;m not shy in pointing out a <br/>\nbetter way to say something. I&#39;m happy to edit their <br/>\nletters/notes/articles/etc.---IF they ask. If they ask &quot;why&quot; <br/>\nsuch-and-such is wrong, I can tell them: you use that &quot;&#39;s&quot; because <br/>\nEnglish uses a &quot;possessive before the gerund.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it is important to YOU that your children learn grammar, then YOU <br/>\nlearn grammar and be able to answer their questions about language <br/>\nusage. Don&#39;t use bad grammar in front of them. Make every effort to <br/>\nunderstand how language works and share what you know.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s NO different than any other thing. If it were important to me that <br/>\nmy boys understand about car engines, I would need to either KNOW about <br/>\ncar engines or find someone who does. Car engines and their care would <br/>\nbe high on my list of things that we&#39;d talk about. (They&#39;re NOT, in my <br/>\nfamily---we have a good mechanic, so I doubt my sons will ever be <br/>\nimmersed in that particular world. And that&#39;s fine---but *some* people <br/>\nwould think I&#39;m doing my boys a huge disservice to not expose them to <br/>\nauto care and maintenance. A lot more people feel the same way about <br/>\ngrammar. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend whose mother never allowed her in the kitchen---no <br/>\njoke. Not even for a glass of water. We had to ask *her*, and she would <br/>\nbring it to us. Her mother wonders now why Caroline doesn&#39;t cook. <br/>\nLuckily she married a man who adores being in the kitchen. Exposure, <br/>\nexposure, exposure!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point &lt;g&gt; is that if our children are surrounded by things, they <br/>\nwill learn them---naturally and (relatively) painlessly. &lt;g&gt; If you <br/>\nchoose to use good grammar, the example you&#39;re setting is that grammar <br/>\nis important. Plus---what we *hear* becomes natural to our ears.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to diagram a sentence to understand grammar. (I have <br/>\nnever diagramed a sentence; that became popular, I guess, just after my <br/>\nschool days. My brother had to though.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of good books on understanding grammar so that *YOU* <br/>\ncan become more familiar with how and why. _Eats, Shoots and Leaves_ is <br/>\nvery popular. _A Grammar Book for You and I (Oops ME!): All the Grammar <br/>\nYou Need to Know to Succeed in Life_. _The Elements of Style_ is good, <br/>\nbut dry. I&#39;m interested in getting _Grammar Snobs are Great BIG <br/>\nMeanies_. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBy imposing it as a separate thing---like a school subject---you&#39;re <br/>\nmaking it almost inaccessible.. Better to make it a part of everyday <br/>\nconversation (so to speak &lt;g&gt;) They learn it because they USE it. And <br/>\nthey learn it better if it&#39;s modeled better *for* them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Intro: Newbie here! :)","postDate":"1205762790","msgId":31003,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZybHR0Nit0aGs4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZyazc1MittNTVtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30996,"nextInTopic":31004,"prevInTime":31002,"nextInTime":31004,"topicId":30964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~..there s a huge line of them, waiting for them on the SAT/ACT when they graduate. but do they know them?~~ The SAT/ACT may never be their reality.

Why? Why didn&#39;t you project that behavior  <br/>\nonto their future 16 yo selves? Why did you think that just by living  <br/>\nlife that their sentences would flesh out and become more complex if  <br/>\nsomeone didn&#39;t make them? Why would they ever use a dozen words if 2  <br/>\ngot the meaning across? Because you&#39;d seen it happen?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you worry that their right now selves are who they will be in  <br/>\n10+ years unless you make them be something different than what they  <br/>\nare? Why do you think they&#39;re incapable of learning about the world?  <br/>\nBecause you only know institutionalized kids? You only know kids  <br/>\nwho&#39;ve had information they don&#39;t care about crammed into them for  <br/>\nyears and years?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve seen kids absorb what state they live in, learn what a noun is  <br/>\nin order to play MadLibs, figure out percentages and charts and  <br/>\ngraphs and memorize complex 3D maps and strategize ways past an  <br/>\nobstacle in order to play video games (by using math that&#39;s much more  <br/>\ncomplex and real that is taught in school). *Your* part is to give  <br/>\nthem rich lives so they aren&#39;t locked away from a world where they  <br/>\nwould naturally pick up what state they live in! And pick up that  <br/>\nShakespeare existed. But don&#39;t focus on where you want them to go  <br/>\n(Shakespeare). Focus on what&#39;s fun for them and the world will be in  <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan unschooled kids sit down and ace the SAT on the first try? It  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be reasonable to expect them to. But they&#39;ve absorbed the  <br/>\nfoundation of knowledge they need by *using* what kids in school have  <br/>\nonly been cramming into their heads with memorization. They lack the  <br/>\nformal language to manipulate it but understanding is the truly  <br/>\nprofound part of knowledge. The formal language can be learned easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat unschooled kids learn is how to learn. They learn how *they*  <br/>\nlearn. They don&#39;t absorb the idea as schooled kids do that they must  <br/>\nbe taught by an expert with a textbook and homework.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey can also learn that a lot of colleges are moving away from SATs  <br/>\n(and even more by the time your kids are ready for college) and  <br/>\ndeliberately choose a school that doesn&#39;t use them. They can take  <br/>\ncollege classes in high school *for fun* at community colleges. They  <br/>\ncan work and volunteer and apprentice in the fields that interest  <br/>\nthem. They can actually be *doing* what they plan to get paid for  <br/>\nbefore they go to college (or get a job). That looks *way* better to  <br/>\ncolleges than some kid who&#39;s been trained to fill in the right dot on  <br/>\na piece of paper. Colleges like older students (and don&#39;t require  <br/>\nSATs from them!) who have been out in life doing what they want to  <br/>\ndo, exploring. The colleges know they&#39;re already capable of doing the  <br/>\nwork that they&#39;ll learn in college. They&#39;ll know that they&#39;re  <br/>\nenthusiastic about the major because they&#39;ve already been involved in  <br/>\nit. As opposed to high school kids who&#39;ve been kept locked away from  <br/>\nthe world for 12+ years memorizing at textbooks and jumping through  <br/>\nhoops they&#39;re told to jump through so they can jump through more  <br/>\nhoops to do what maybe might interest them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; also, another question came to mind.  how do unschooled kids get  <br/>\n&gt; into college?  if they have no transcripts..i mean, they weren&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; taking any classes..were they?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As Kelly asked recently, why would you want your kids to look like  <br/>\nevery other applicant to college? If they&#39;ve been living interesting  <br/>\nlives exploring the subject they plan to pursue in college, why would  <br/>\nyou want their application to look like they&#39;d spent their years  <br/>\nsitting in classrooms with textbooks?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve so bought into the educational system that we believe that it&#39;s  <br/>\nthe ultimate achievement in learning. Baloney. It&#39;s just all that  <br/>\ncolleges have to work with. They have 1000s of applications that all  <br/>\nlook *exactly* the same. They have all these applicants who&#39;ve been  <br/>\njumping through hoops for 12 years being told they need for more  <br/>\nyears of hoops in order to achieve the American Dream.
