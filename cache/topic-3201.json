What I really liked about the book I read was <br/>\nthat the authors reiterated that the schedule should be a TOOL not a <br/>\nTASKMASTER.  So I have been using my household schedule as a guide <br/>\nthus far, and not getting to caught up with times.  I am  allowing <br/>\nfor lots of flexibility, and so far I am still getting much more done <br/>\nwith less stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew that scheduling the kids would not work for any of us, but the <br/>\nunschooling fears are still there...  I almost immediately saw the <br/>\nerror of my ways, even though my attempt was only for scheduling  <br/>\nfocused time together.

(What do you mean by that anyway?)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a challenge, and the chore issue is one that we have been re-<br/>\nexamining for awhile. We have loosened our views quite a bit, for <br/>\nexample to make toy clean-up a family responsibility instead of a <br/>\nrequirement for the kids (used to use a timer).  We do ask them to be <br/>\ninvoloved and help them by handing them things, etc. but are really <br/>\ntrying to keep it positive.  The girls put their clothes away after <br/>\nwe had a family meeting and I said that I cannot keep up with putting <br/>\nthe laundry away, and they agreed to help with the situation.  I <br/>\nbought them their own small baskets, and they have been cheerful <br/>\nabout it. We asked them to help with feeding the animals for the same <br/>\nreason, and they have been helpful in remembering the task, plus they <br/>\nseem to be bonding more with the animals since. We do feel that the <br/>\nassigned &quot;jobs&quot; (we don&#39;t call them chores) are fine as long as the <br/>\nkids are in agreement to the responsibility, and we are not tyrants <br/>\nabout it. If the girls forget or resist, we just *do it for them*.  <br/>\nWe talk about the fact that we as a family have a responsibilty to <br/>\ncare for what God has given us and help each other in doing so, but <br/>\nwe are by no means legalistic.  The &quot;inappropriate activities&quot; would <br/>\nbe things like making a swimming pool for Barbies with real water in <br/>\nthe middle of the living room carpet (re-directed to kitchen floor), <br/>\nor seeing if the newly caught frog likes living in the toilet (re-<br/>\ndirected to setting up terrarium).  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;It sounds like you could benefit from some de-schooling (as all of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>us who were in school once can).

It may not be a<br/>\ngood way to get to Unschooling to necessarily expect the same enthusiasm<br/>\nabout a schedule from your children.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am finding more and more that the girls (3 & 5yo) are just not <br/>\nneeding me as much and there are days when they often play for hours <br/>\nwithout asking me for involvement, other than bathroom help, to help <br/>\nwith a conflict, or for snacks. I just check in on what they are up <br/>\nto and sometimes comment, or re-direct inappropriate activites, but <br/>\nthen am free to go on my merry way.  And I am having a hard time with <br/>\nthis at this point. It does not seem right to my schooled brain.  We <br/>\nare homeschooling -- I should be doing more with them!  We should be <br/>\nsitting down together more!  I should not have so much freedom!  They <br/>\nshould not have so much freedom! They should be doing something <br/>\nacademically constructive!  I should schedule them too! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you could benefit from some de-schooling (as all of us who<br/>\nwere in school once can). These kinds of ideas are residual &quot;schoolthink&quot;,<br/>\nas I guess you have intuited.<br/>\nwww.sandradodd.com/deschooling<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact check out the whole site about Unschooling. It is a collection of<br/>\nmany people&#39;s enjoyable and challenging writings over time, as well as<br/>\nSandra&#39;s lucid essays and articles. Also check out the archives here, as<br/>\nthis particular issue (household management) is a perennial topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I do have a few things scheduled for them, things that we feel are <br/>\nnecessary to family life.  Like a morning job for each, and an <br/>\nevening job for each.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn (4.5) has no scheduled chores. However she often spontaneously offers<br/>\nto help, or does something kind and generous for me or dh. Just seconds ago<br/>\nshe brought me a treat from the kitchen as a surprise. One of the more<br/>\nchallenging aspects of Unschooling is the constant examination of one&#39;s<br/>\nassumptions - such as &quot;scheduling chores is necessary to family life&quot; or the<br/>\nconcept of &quot;inappropriate activities&quot; that need re-direction. (What do you<br/>\nmean by that anyway?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe true goal of Unschooling is not merely an education for our children. To<br/>\nparaphrase Joyce: it is to enhance our relationship with our children so<br/>\nthat they can blossom into their authentic best selves (Anne calls the<br/>\nSHINING). Learning happens (joyfully) along the way because learning is the<br/>\nnatural activity of the human brain. <br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I came across an inspirational website","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2036852064\">Hello Everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wondering -- how anyone else goes about managing the household <br/>\nresponsibilities while unschooling?  I came across an inspirational <br/>\nwebsite by a homeschooling couple with 8 children recently, and <br/>\nordered their book Managers of the Home because I have long felt <br/>\nextremely overwhelmed with this facet of life, and have been <br/>\nsearching for a solution that will bring a more organized home and <br/>\nlifestyle, where the things can be found, company can drop in without <br/>\npanic, and the finances under control.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe ideas this family shares in this book make a lot of sense, and I <br/>\nhave decided to implement a schedule for our family, with a few <br/>\ndifferences.  The authors&#39; family has a set schedule for 6 days of <br/>\nthe week -- for household tasks, meals, business, baths, play time, <br/>\nschool time, hobbies, kids&#39;naps, chores, etc.  ALL their time is <br/>\nscheduled, for each family member, even infants. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince we are trying the unschooling path, this seemed much too rigid <br/>\nto follow.  No spontaneity!  And no freedom for learning!  So, I <br/>\nadapted my schedule to include household tasks, business, and an <br/>\nevening routine, since from dinner time on is usually chaos until my <br/>\nhusband leaves for work at night, and we are never on the same page.  <br/>\nI am tweaking a schedule for shopping, errands, library, etc. All of <br/>\nthis(when followed)is making a positive difference in the state of <br/>\nour home and bringing peace, and I am excited about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, at first, when I put the schedule together, I was still <br/>\nstressing over kindergarten starting so I thought I would <br/>\nschedule &quot;school&quot; time thinking it could be used as time available <br/>\nto &quot;spend together&quot;, without a specific agenda (unschooling school <br/>\ntime, I thought!) Then I of course found out that most of the time <br/>\nwhen the scheduled &quot;school&quot; time came, my girls usually were <br/>\nengrossed in their own play or project and didn&#39;t need me to get <br/>\ninvolved, and everything was thrown off. So I have adapted a loose <br/>\noverall schedule to allow for spontaneous moments to be available to <br/>\nthem, based on the way our days naturally flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am finding more and more that the girls (3 & 5yo) are just not <br/>\nneeding me as much and there are days when they often play for hours <br/>\nwithout asking me for involvement, other than bathroom help, to help <br/>\nwith a conflict, or for snacks. I just check in on what they are up <br/>\nto and sometimes comment, or re-direct inappropriate activites, but <br/>\nthen am free to go on my merry way.  And I am having a hard time with <br/>\nthis at this point. It does not seem right to my schooled brain.  We <br/>\nare homeschooling -- I should be doing more with them!  We should be <br/>\nsitting down together more!  I should not have so much freedom!  They <br/>\nshould not have so much freedom! They should be doing something <br/>\nacademically constructive!  I should schedule them too!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a few things scheduled for them, things that we feel are <br/>\nnecessary to family life.  Like a morning job for each, and an <br/>\nevening job for each.  And a family devotional time in the morning, <br/>\nas well as our family evening routine.  It seems to be working out <br/>\nwell, but I am swinging between content and anxious, as you can see.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this is not exactly a scheduling issue, but a new unschooler <br/>\nissue?  Either way, thanks for listening.  It is great to come here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMZ</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3051,"nextTopicId":3231}}
