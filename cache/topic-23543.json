But the real life saver is indoor outdoor<br/>\ncarpet. Buy a big piece and put it down. Let them play<br/>\non that, it keeps the mud down and gives them a safe<br/>\nplace to play.

I don&#39;t know if this would<br/>\nhelp but we instituted a rule when they were really<br/>\nlittle about only running through puddles when we were<br/>\non the way home. We always kept track of the good<br/>\nlooking ones and made sure we went back to them. Maybe<br/>\nyou could make a deal with him to wait until you got<br/>\nhome. I&#39;m sure he doesn&#39;t really like going out<br/>\ndripping wet. Oh, and there are some great heads out<br/>\nthere that produce a great spray without a lot of<br/>\nwater and force, which can hurt the little ones.<br/>\nGoggles and water shoes make safer fun too.
