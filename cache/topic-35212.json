(I think NVC is great and powerful. Thanks  <br/>\nMeredith:)) I can&#39;t quite think how to describe it in a way to let you  <br/>\nknow how important it is.  Here is a quote from the website (www.cnvc.org <br/>\n) for the Centre for Nonviolent Communication:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;NVC involves both communication skills that foster compassionate  <br/>\nrelating and consciousness of the interdependence of our well being  <br/>\nand using power with others to work together to meet the needs of all  <br/>\nconcerned&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can search the list archives too as I know it&#39;s come up here years  <br/>\nago. My suggestion is that you read about it if you don&#39;t already know  <br/>\nthe process.  You could then try it with your friend and her children.  <br/>\nWhen you use NVC, the other person doesn&#39;t need to know NVC for it to  <br/>\nhelp.  You can start with the website and the book Nonviolent  <br/>\nCommunication: a language of life by Marshall Rosenberg.  The author  <br/>\nhas also written a booklet for parents Raising Children  <br/>\nCompassionately: Parenting the Nonviolent Communication Way. (I&#39;ve  <br/>\nrequested this one on interlibrary loan and I&#39;m looking forward to  <br/>\nreading it). You can order the books online or try your local public  <br/>\nlibrary. There are also workshops if you really get into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you describe the other parent as a friend, I can really understand  <br/>\nwhy you would want to help her as well as her children. I&#39;d like to  <br/>\nbuy copies of the books for all my relatives and friends, but first  <br/>\nI&#39;ll have to win the lottery!<br/>\n<br/>\nKimberlee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When you have time, I would be open to any suggestions as I see the  <br/>\n&gt; hurt<br/>\n&gt; they are doing to this very sweet boy and while my mind says he  <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t mine<br/>\n&gt; and I have no right to tell his mother what to do.

Some kids don&#39;t have  any but many <br/>\nchildren go through a period where they are repeating sounds and  syllables and <br/>\nwords.  Three to four year old children are going through  these amazing speech <br/>\nand language  changes as they are learning  inflection and sound systems.  Also, <br/>\ntheir vocabulary is just  exploding. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s one of the main concerns of parents at this age as their children  start <br/>\nhaving repetitions with their expressive speech. I usually recommend  that 1) <br/>\nmake sure you are on their level when you talk with them....kneel down  and <br/>\nget eye contact and have all the time in the world to listen.  Don&#39;t  finish <br/>\ntheir words...just be patient.   When you understand what they  are saying, <br/>\nrepeat it back so they know you have understood.     2) Don&#39;t call attention to <br/>\ntheir speech and find ways they can express  themselves nonverbally if they are <br/>\nhaving a rough day<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s just like walking or reading....kids go through the process in their  <br/>\nown time and in their own way.  It is highly unusual for dysfluencies at  this <br/>\nage to continue and progress to stuttering.  <br/>\n <br/>\nGail <br/>\n<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gail-hummingbirdhaven.blogspot.com/_\">http://gail-hummingbirdhaven.blogspot.com/_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gail-hummingbirdhaven.blogspot.com/)\">http://gail-hummingbirdhaven.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Looking for a car that&#39;s sporty, fun and fits in your budget? <br/>\nRead reviews on AOL Autos.      <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://autos.aol.com/cars-BMW-128-2008/expert-review?ncid=aolaut00050000000017\">http://autos.aol.com/cars-BMW-128-2008/expert-review?ncid=aolaut00050000000017</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Speech questions","postDate":"1218161870","msgId":35215,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwODA3MTkxN24xNjMwYmYxOHJjNjZkYWY2OTMxYWY3OTY1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ4OUJBMEU0LjQwNTAyMDBAY294Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDQ4OUJBMEU0LjQwNTAyMDBAY294Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":35214,"nextInTopic":35216,"prevInTime":35214,"nextInTime":35216,"topicId":35212,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A lot of what you re seeing is probably development.
