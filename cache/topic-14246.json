You may get  <br/>\nseveral people who will conditionally approve of homeschooling, but  <br/>\nyou&#39;ll get a lot of people who think it&#39;s great. And then every once  <br/>\nin a while you come up against a compadre...someone who not only  <br/>\nKNOWS what you&#39;re talking about but is on the same path. Truly cool.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s just starting out, but we&#39;re on a committee together and we&#39;ll  <br/>\nbe seeing each other again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14229,"nextTopicId":14262}}
