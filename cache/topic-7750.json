I find myself in that <br/>\nsituation and most days I can make it work but sometimes I want to <br/>\npull my hair out. LOL <br/>\n<br/>\nA little background: <br/>\nMy husband & I adopted our three 2 years ago. The oldest two have <br/>\nwhat is called Reactive Attachment Disorder, with my oldest being <br/>\nthe one who is more severe. We are actually considering putting him <br/>\nin a theraputic group home. My middle one is healing and the <br/>\nyoungest is emotionally healthy. I have unschooled the middle two <br/>\nsince taking them out of school and things have gone from good to <br/>\nfantastic! :-) Not only do they love being home, they love the <br/>\nfreedom they have and they are thriving and loving every day. :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve posted a bit about my situation on some of the other lists and <br/>\nalso on Pam&#39;s NoMoreSpanking List. I&#39;m wondering if anybody has any <br/>\nadvice even though they may not be in my situation. I would love <br/>\nnothing more than to unschool all of them but it&#39;s not possible at <br/>\nthis time and I am always looking for ways to make this work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (7), Shawna (10) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 30, 2003<br/>\nHomeschooling in Ocala, Florida</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7685,"nextTopicId":7759}}
