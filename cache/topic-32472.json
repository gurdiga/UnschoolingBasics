And I&#39;ve hurt his feelings -<br/>\ndeeply. For that I can only apologize and behave in ways that show I have<br/>\nchanged my thinking and that kind of injury will NOT happen again to us. We<br/>\nuse a crib liner & wool blanket (small enough to be totally portable) & wash<br/>\nit every day it&#39;s wet. I&#39;ve got bacterial cleaner for the cushions, in case<br/>\nof spillovers (or when I don&#39;t get the spot made up in time). We&#39;ve got a<br/>\n$60 sofa; it&#39;d take A LOT more than $60 in therapy to recover from a mom who<br/>\nshames accidents.<br/>\nH helps out by picking up the wet bedding and putting it in the laundry<br/>\nroom; sometimes he remembers to pick up his wet pants and sometimes he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t, I get them in the laundry room quickly, while I&#39;m cleaning cushions<br/>\nand bringing them outside to dry. Yes, every day sometimes. Sometimes I<br/>\nstart out a martyr and figure out while scrubbing that my kid needs his<br/>\nmama, not a martyr & the transformation is completed before the cleaning is<br/>\ndone! The days I&#39;m really proud of, are the ones where there martyr is not<br/>\neven thought of!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my dad noticed how I handled Hayden&#39;s bedwetting, he came up with<br/>\nheretofore unheard stories of his childhood and his own struggles with<br/>\nbedwetting. He commented how shameful it was for his sister, who wet the bed<br/>\nuntil she was 13; it was less bad for him, being the oldest and having it<br/>\nself-resolve at about age 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve looked at dietary connections (originally we thought it was linked to<br/>\nyellow food coloring) and exhaustion levels (mostly happens when he totally<br/>\nwiped out when he finally sleeps) and pee frequency (he&#39;s wet the bed after<br/>\na big pee before sleep!) -- He&#39;s declined goodnites (a negative connotation<br/>\nfrom another friend who wears them) & is open to other ideas I may have<br/>\n(because I&#39;m coming from a &quot;help you&quot; perspective, rather than a &quot;blame you&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;fix you&quot; place). I picked up some homeopathic tabs today, I&#39;ll offer<br/>\nthem to him (a TRUE offer, if he declines, I&#39;m not attached) and see how<br/>\nthat goes. Regardless, I&#39;m honored to have the job of clean-up for the short<br/>\ntime it lasts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see big difference between a child who chooses to pee on the sofa rather<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; than walk to the bathroom, and a child who accidently spills his milk. If<br/>\n&gt; I spilled a jar of spaghetti sauce on the floor, I&#39;d appreciate the help,<br/>\n&gt; but I wouldn&#39;t expect anyone to help me clean it up. If my husband peed on<br/>\n&gt; the sofa I&#39;d expect him to clean it up, too. If my roommate peed on the<br/>\n&gt; sofa, I&#39;d expect him to clean it up.

I treated it as one would expect, I cleaned it up<br/>\nwithout shame or blame. He knew I had my hands full caring for him and our 2<br/>\n& 4 year old children and working full-time - he would never, ever *choose*<br/>\nto create more work for me.<br/>\nThe least I can do is treat his son with the same kindness I gave to him;<br/>\nthe same kindness Hayden already witnessed me extending to Mitch.

Using the potty was his idea.  Wearing<br/>\nunderwear was his idea.  He was and had been using the potty regularly for<br/>\nsome time, knew the cues and acted on them.  But, he would also just pee and<br/>\npoop in his Pullup because he felt like it or because he didn&#39;t want to<br/>\nleave the show he was watching.  (We noticed that this happened most often<br/>\nin front of the TV).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, when he changed to underwear, I knew he was perfectly capable of not<br/>\npeeing and pooping in his underwear.  I also figured that he would not<br/>\nnecessarily alter his behavior just because he was in underwear.  So, I gave<br/>\nhim the tools to take care of the issue until he decided not to pee on the<br/>\nsofa.  During the week, he wet the sofa about once a day.  He&#39;d go get the<br/>\nspray and the sponge and do his almost 4-year-old best at cleaning up, then<br/>\nI or his dad would finish the job for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I&#39;m having is that for all but the smallest children, everything<br/>\nis a choice.  In this case, I knew that my son was making a choice.  One of<br/>\nthe consequences of that choice was that it caused discomfort and<br/>\ndifficulties for the other members of the family.   Since we live in a<br/>\nfamily unit, we encourage our kids to be sensitive to other members of the<br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\n I see big difference between a child who chooses to pee on the sofa rather<br/>\nthan walk to the bathroom, and a child who accidently spills his milk.

Those kind don&#39;t work well here. The  <br/>\nideas that will work here are ideas that put the relationship first  <br/>\nand work in solving the problem around those constraints.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s thousands of ideas that &quot;work&quot; for a family.

Here&#39;s an example:  I do the<br/>\nlaundry in the family, at least most of the time.  Sometimes my husband will<br/>\ndo a load or two.  I will not go into my son&#39;s room (he&#39;s 15) unless I<br/>\nabsolutely have to.  I&#39;m not a neat freak (I don&#39;t think), but I do like my<br/>\nliving space to be organized enough that I can find things, without a lot of<br/>\ndirty dishes and trash on the floor.  That said, my son&#39;s room is his and he<br/>\ncan do with it what he wants.  I just find it too stressful to go in there.<br/>\nSo, I asked him a long time ago to bring his laundry downstairs for<br/>\nwashing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe learned that if he didn&#39;t bring his clothes down, they didn&#39;t get<br/>\nwashed.  Once as I was about to climb into bed exhausted after an extremely<br/>\nhectic day, my son -- then about 12 -- came into my room panic stricken.  He<br/>\nhad to have a particular shirt for some activity he was participating in the<br/>\nnext day and he really wanted it washed.  Any other night, I would have been<br/>\nhappy to help, but this night I was fighting back tears, I was so tired.<br/>\nSo, I told him that I could not stay up to wash his clothes, but I would be<br/>\nhappy to show him how to do it, which I did.  He did a fine job, went to his<br/>\nactivity the next day in a clean shirt, and seemed quite happy about it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, he had seen me wash, dry, fold and put away clothes for 12 years, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think he had any clue as to how to go about it.  I showed him how to<br/>\ndo it.  Did I teach him?  Sure.  Did he learn?  Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then, I still do his laundry.  But probably every week or two, there&#39;s<br/>\nsomething he wants washed for the next day.  He doesn&#39;t even ask me to do<br/>\nit.  He just does it himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, May 9, 2008 at 1:03 AM, &lt;kbcdlovejo@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Carron Armstrong &lt;carronna@... &lt;carronna%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a little confused.

Linnaea likes to clean up with the carpet cleaner when a stain<br/>\n&gt; requires it, so I usually offer her the opportunity to do so. But I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; set them up with the consequences of their actions. I vacuumed their rooms<br/>\n&gt; today. I did it because I was vacuuming the hall and I thought it would be<br/>\n&gt; good to get their rooms while I had the vacuum cleaner up there. The other<br/>\n&gt; day I went through an unpacked box, I didn&#39;t really unpack, I sort of piled<br/>\n&gt; all the stuff up that was in it on the floor, in Simon&#39;s room. He didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; chastize me, or tell me that I had to clean the mess up I&#39;d made, instead he<br/>\n&gt; cleaned it up, and then he helped his sister to clean her room. And not<br/>\n&gt; because he had to, or she had to, but because she wanted her room to feel as<br/>\n&gt; welcoming as his room, he thought it being cleaner might help. If I made<br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; clean their rooms, they could never choose to do so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When Linnaea was 3 maybe, or almost 3, Simon decided she needed to be using<br/>\n&gt; the toilet. I have no idea why, Simon didn&#39;t stop with diapers until we were<br/>\n&gt; in Kyoto and he was 3 and a 1/2 and David had bought out all the diapers in<br/>\n&gt; his size that he could find. He bribed her with candy. Again, I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; why that worked, there was free access to candy in our house, but somehow<br/>\n&gt; Simon giving her a piece of candy when she&#39;d used the toilet got her using<br/>\n&gt; the toilet. As soon as he ran out of candy, she stopped using the toilet. We<br/>\n&gt; got more candy in, but she was no longer willing to have him bribe her. She<br/>\n&gt; did it on her own a few months later, no bribes, no consequences, just being<br/>\n&gt; ready. And she didn&#39;t have to clean up after herself if she peed on the<br/>\n&gt; floor or pooped. Nor did Simon, and both of them use the toilet just fine<br/>\n&gt; now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Schuyler<br/>\n&gt; www.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----<br/>\n&gt; From: Carron Armstrong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:carronna@...\">carronna@...</a> &lt;carronna%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, 8 May, 2008 3:30:04 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Potty training & other question<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son was almost 4 when he decided he wanted to wear underwear instead of<br/>\n&gt; pullups.

I want to embrace this total lifestyle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and parenting style, but I have a few questions:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1) My youngest had a very hard time potty training (very resistant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; until he decided to do it himself ... imagine that!), but finally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; achieved success at school, but spotty success at home. He just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gets very &quot;into&quot; what he is doing and misses the bodily cues that he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; needs to go. Anyway, since we have pulled them out of school (a few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weeks ago) he has decided that he just wants to wear a pull-up. Is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this ok? I feel that it is, but I guess I just need some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reassurance.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2) I enjoy letting the boys stay up later than they used to. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feel that it is really great family time, since they get to spend<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more time with their dad when he gets home from work. However, my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; husband feels that we are losing our husband/wife time and that life<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is getting too focused on the boys, to the detriment of our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; marriage.

Has anyone experienced these feelings with their spouse?<br/>\nWhat have you done?~~<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no single answer that might work best for you, but I can tell<br/>\nyou what we did. We changed our thinking!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re all up at night, eating, playing etc...so dh and I spend time<br/>\ntogether in the mornings. The kids sleep later than we do, so we&#39;ll<br/>\nsit outside on the deck, watching birds and sipping tea in the<br/>\nmorning. It might not be that long before a sleepy-eyed child joins<br/>\nus, but we do get some time to talk and connect. In fact, I&#39;m getting<br/>\nready to go up and start tea now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1. My son is eight and is finally getting it. We found a watch that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>has a repeating timer and best of all it vibrates and/or beeps. We<br/>\nstarted out with two hours. Every two hours it would go off he had to<br/>\ngo sit on the potty for ten minutes or until he went whichever came<br/>\nfirst.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds invasive and unecessary. I think trust needs to extend<br/>\ninto these areas as well. I have one child that couldn&#39;t stay dry all<br/>\nnight until around the age of 11 or so. People grow into it in their<br/>\nown time, barring any true physical abnormality.  There are ways to<br/>\nhelp a child be comfortable and grow into something in their own time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; 2.

Children do require sleep and<br/>\nraising zombies isn&#39;t nearly as fun as well rested children.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I&#39;ve never raised zombies! But my kids would think that was<br/>\npretty cool.;)<br/>\nWhy would you need a &quot;family night&quot;? I&#39;m really curious about this<br/>\none. If a family is together and connecting (which I assume<br/>\nunschooling gives that) then why a special time set aside for that<br/>\nconnecting? It should be as natural as breathing. And &quot;date night&quot;?<br/>\nThat happens about once every blue moon. We are adults and can find<br/>\nways to connect and be intimate without leaving our children every week.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll people need sleep, not just children. And whether they get that<br/>\nsleep starting late at night or earlier, what matters is they get the<br/>\nsleep...NOT when it starts!  9 hours of sleep, is 9 hours of sleep<br/>\nwhether it begins at 8pm or 2am. Trusting one&#39;s body is more important<br/>\nthan the &quot;when&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe purposely don&#39;t plan on activities early in the morning, but when<br/>\nsomething comes up, my children have no problem tweaking their sleep<br/>\nin order to accommodate because we would only go if they really wanted<br/>\nto participate.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Potty training & other questions","postDate":"1210250063","msgId":32502,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ2dXMwZitnNTA0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ2c2lsNytvcWZ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32501,"nextInTopic":32506,"prevInTime":32501,"nextInTime":32503,"topicId":32472,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
