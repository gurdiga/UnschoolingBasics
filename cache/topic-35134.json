And for me  <br/>\nthat means that when I see them being mistreated I have to find a  <br/>\nway, often a creative one, to be on their side.  And many times it  <br/>\nmeans finding a way to remove them from the situation.  When people  <br/>\nmake snide comments about my children&#39;s hair, their clothes, their  <br/>\nlove for the computer, their outspoken language, whatever, it is  <br/>\nusually a good time to skillfully try to change the subject or if  <br/>\nthey are persistent with the comments then to leave the place.<br/>\nThere are some gender differences for sure.  Usually being an ally to  <br/>\nmy son means finding ways to support him expressing his emotions -  <br/>\nespecially crying.  And that includes encouraging other boys to feel  <br/>\ntheir feelings and express them.  He is always hearing - you are too  <br/>\nold (eg to co-sleep - he is 8 1/2), you have to control yourself  <br/>\n(when he cries deeply), and you have to learn to face the real  <br/>\nworld.  And for my daughter being an ally usually means standing up  <br/>\nfor her when people say she &#39;can&#39;t&#39;.  She is always hearing - you are  <br/>\ntoo young, you won&#39;t understand, are you sure she&#39;s able to (the last  <br/>\none addressed to me in front of her).<br/>\nSo stand up for your child the way that you seem to be doing.  There  <br/>\nwill be constant challenges to your confidence and once in a while it  <br/>\nis so wonderful when your children let you know how much they are  <br/>\naware that they can count on you to be on their side.<br/>\nGillian</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35107,"nextTopicId":35141}}
