Some of what they&#39;ll be doing is to adapt him to a school environment - that&#39;s what preschool programs are for, to get kids ready for school.

I was taking him to a specialty care facility out of our local children&#39;s hospital 2x a week (out of pocket since our ins policy doesn&#39;t cover speech). The speech language pathologist recommended he get evaluated by the school system to qualify for additional treatment (at no cost). It was a long process but he does qualify. With that qualification came their recommendation for 3hrs 4 days a week to be in a special Ed speech prek room on a school campus, yikes! Because if his severity, his frustration with not being understood and financial resins we tried it. Today was his last day.... After 2 weeks he now uses the terms &quot;doing it right&quot; and tells me how he has to try and try again because he can&#39;t &quot;say it right&quot;.... I now have a lot to undo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know your free options out there or what you can apply for but in FL every child has access to the same special needs care. I can choose to take him for 30 minute sessions and sit with him rather than the classroom setting. I also applied for a speech treatment grant (there are hundreds online) so that I pay only $25 a visit to continue with the Children&#39;s Hospital speech pathology facility that he was going to until 2 weeks ago. This will help. I was told by the children&#39;s hospital that his speech will not just correct itself when it is a severe disorder such as my sons. If it was simply a few delayed sounds, then yes, but the things my son is doing needs intervention to improve.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really research what you have available to you.

Be patient when he speaks. Give him your full, unrushed attention. If you haven&#39;t understood something, let him know the part you didn&#39;t understand, just as you would to a friend. Not to correct him but to give him information so he can meet his need to communicate better. If you do understand him, but no one else would, don&#39;t worry.

The good news is that the page says having an IEP does not mean that you can&#39;t pull them out. In some states they make it very difficult for kids with an IEP to withdraw. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your question about long-term prognosis with speech, whoever diagnosed the problem originally should be able to tell you if the cause is something that will resolve on its own in time, or not. For instance, if it&#39;s an issue of apraxia or something else physically wrong, that would be different from a phonological weakness that is not caused by something physical. Immature articulation can resolve through time as the kid picks up on the difference in what is being said/what they say and self corrects. Also, once they can read it can sometimes help because they see a difference between what they are saying and how a word is spelled. From what I hear from other parents with speech issues, not all speech therapists do a good job telling the difference and will have your kid do mouth exercises (blowing bubbles and stuff like that) that won&#39;t really help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marieke Hensel &lt;marieke@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; I am very new to unschooling, as we have just decided not to return after<br/>\n&gt; the summer.
