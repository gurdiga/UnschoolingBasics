As if I must &#39;explain&#39; the &#39;whys&#39; of my parenting.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Example:  Today at Sea World, as we were standing in line for a dinner show, a couple of elderly couples were out together and standing in line behind my son and I.  They commented on his tiger face make-up which lead to his growling at them.  The comment was nice, but obviously, he had become the tiger.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  At this point my girls joined us.  One normal haired, also sporting a tiger face, and the other normal faced, sporting her usual self in neon pink.  Needless to say, she (the pink haired one) raised eyebrows as I claimed them.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I call it my mother&#39;s syndrome as I feet compelled to defend my daughter&#39;s choices. IE: She&#39;s intelligent, speaks four languages, .....you get the point.   My mother always needed to tell EVERYONE all the personal details of my life when I was a teen.   I hated it.  Now I live with my MIL who tells the same ten stories over and over again, as if everyone shall gleen knowledge from her exploits.  (She doesn&#39;t waste time talking of her child.)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Anyhow, why should I care what these elders of society think of me as a mother of a bright young lady?  I don&#39;t need to justify my choices with anyone but myself and my maker.  I don&#39;t need to justify my daughter&#39;s choices, either.  Today, I successfully kept my mouth shut and let them think what they will.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I still need to work on not trying to grade my parenting.<br/>\n  Vicki<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBored stiff?
