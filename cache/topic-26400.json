My <br/>\nhusband&#39;s name is Chris. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been interested in homeschooling for several years and have <br/>\nresearched it pretty thoroughly. I felt certain that, when the time <br/>\ncame, I would choose that option for my kids&#39; education.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end though, I chickened out and enrolled Camryn in public <br/>\nschools, where she has become increasingly bored and understimulated <br/>\never since. <br/>\n<br/>\nAcademically, she&#39;s pretty far ahead of her second grade peers (she <br/>\ntested at the fifth grade level in reading and writing and the <br/>\nfourth grade level in math last year), but socially, she&#39;s right <br/>\nwhere she should be. When I inquired about the gifted program, her <br/>\nteacher told me it was essentially a bureaucratic nightmare to get <br/>\nher involved before the third grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, she&#39;s fairly disillusioned by the school system at the point <br/>\n(as am I), and so we will be beginning our homeschooling journey in <br/>\nabout three weeks (!).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are going to start out with a sabbatical in which Camryn <br/>\nevaluates her interests, then we&#39;ll start unschooling from there. <br/>\nI&#39;m here to learn all I can about unschooling.
