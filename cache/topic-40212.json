A lot of it seems related to schooly &quot;milestones&quot;. I&#39;ve become more aware, since I took Kevin out of school, of the little and big ways that I&#39;m not &quot;fitting in&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know some folks think I&#39;m too attached, that I strive to meet his wants and needs too much, that I let him be when I should be forcing him to fit into the world now. &quot;He&#39;s going to have to learn it sometime!&quot;, they warn. As if I need to create hardship for him so he can learn how to handle it in the future. (That&#39;s like scraping his knee on purpose so he can learn how to deal with that when it actually happens.) Parents are supposed to teach adversity, as if it doesn&#39;t happen on its own. Clamping down on a kid&#39;s creativity--clothes, hair, exuberance--is sometimes like trying to fit a kid into the parent&#39;s perception of the world so the kid won&#39;t have problems in the world later, or something. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I find when I enjoy and support Kevin&#39;s uniqueness, he has more confidence to handle the hard times. Or the times when we really do have to rein it in. I say yes almost all the time and Kevin can accept a no with a lot of ease. He never has to connive to find the yes in a situation--we look for it together...and I feel healed when I say yes, like healed for my little kid self.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Juillet</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Help with view point and acceptance","postDate":"1243034025","msgId":40260,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd2N2JqOStkNWs2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY0NTA5MC42NzUyNC5xbUB3ZWI0NjAwNS5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40254,"nextInTopic":40271,"prevInTime":40259,"nextInTime":40261,"topicId":40212,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************************** When Mo would go out wearing something out of the ordinary (or her shoes on the wrong feet) I used to say She dresses","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2004185192\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jennifer Croce &lt;jennifercroce37@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I took her over to my parents&#39; house like that and my Dad looked at me me perplexed and said, &quot;she has her pajamas on.&quot;  I just shrugged and said, &quot;yeah so?&quot;.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************************<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Mo would go out wearing something out of the ordinary (or her shoes on the &quot;wrong&quot; feet) I used to say &quot;She dresses herself!&quot; in a tone of such pride that there wasn&#39;t much anyone could say in reply.

My daughter wears ponytail holders on her arm (remember Madonna in the 80s?) and sometimes it is rubber bands and she and her brother do it.  The rubber bands go with the rubber band guns her brother designed and created for everyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has been creating characters since she was 2 years old.  She came downstairs with a cowboy hat and spoke with a western accent, &quot;Hi my name&#39;s Cheetah K and I&#39;m a cowgirl&quot;.  She had/has a very particular idea of what a cowgirl would wear and how she would be.  At age 2 she could answer questions all about Cheetah K and her life.  We didn&#39;t have a TV at the time so where this came from??  <br/>\n<br/>\nI could have said, &quot;stop being silly&quot;  or &quot; you can&#39;t wear *that* outside the house&quot;...but I didn&#39;t.  Ok the cowgirl was fairly tame....but how about an egyptian?  A Middle Eastern princess?  A Russian school girl?  Yep all of those too.  She will tie bandanas on any body part available (ankles, head, wrist, leg, waist, woven around fingers and hand) and loves to play with mixing and matching clothes.  She is really into finding &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; outfits and has a thing for hats and jackets--oh and belts.  We went to every store in the area to find her a pair of penny loafers. She now has a couple of Nancy Drew outfits as well as an entire Cheetah K outfit.  She is 9 yo, btw.  So it is 7 years of characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never been a &quot;girly girl&quot; but my dd is.  She loves to dress up and do her hair.  She plays with make up sometimes, and then goes out and plays tomboy--in a dress!  LOL<br/>\nIf I had complained when she wore striped shirt with plaid skort she wouldn&#39;t still be playing around with what works for her.  She has a sassy style that is very fun for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the bandages, it isn&#39;t hurting anything.

Of course we get stared at from time to time . . . but I&#39;ve learned to ignore it by focusing on the fact that my kids are making choices to let their imaginations run wild, which means they are living freely.

Of course we get stared at from time to time . . . but I&#39;ve learned to ignore it by focusing on the fact that my kids are making choices to let their imaginations run wild, which means they are living freely. Like most choices they do and will make, this is not about me - it&#39;s about them, and my role is to support and enjoy. <br/>\nThis reply may seem simple, but - - - it sounds to me like she is having fun here, and is letting her imagination flourish. Many 6yo aren&#39;t comfy with that at all, but your little darlin&#39; seems to be having fun with it. Sounds like an unschooling &quot;win&quot; to me. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Mon, 5/18/09, jennifercroce37 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jennifercroce37@...\">jennifercroce37@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: jennifercroce37 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jennifercroce37@...\">jennifercroce37@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Help with view point and acceptance<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Monday, May 18, 2009, 6:20 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n      I need some help with dealing with my feelings regarding how my dd looks or wants to look.
