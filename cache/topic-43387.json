This is not a conference. There will not be speakers. There will, however, be as many planned activities as the attendees want to organize, which can be anything from round table discussions, to crafts, games, and potluck dinners!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo have the building entirely to our group, we have to have FIVE ROOMS reserved by MARCH 26TH!  That&#39;s just nine days from now, so please, if you&#39;re planning on reserving a room, do so as soon as possible!  Thank you.  Also, for those who asked, yes, you can absolutely arrive a day (or a few) early, and/or leave late.  There are no special rates for groups on accommodations, so it will not cost you any more per night.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to find out more info, see pictures of our accommodations, etc., please check out the website for this event:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://smugunschoolersgathering.blogspot.com/\">http://smugunschoolersgathering.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe hope to see you there!<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie and Idzie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43357,"nextTopicId":43390}}
