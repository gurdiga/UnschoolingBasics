The younger kids <br/>\ndon&#39;t see any logical reason why they should &quot;have&quot; to go to bed <br/>\nearly - its just a weird attempt to control their behavior. So they <br/>\nresist. Its a vicious cycle. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;d love to have the courage to &quot;let them&quot;<br/>\n&gt; stay up without my husband or I actually initiating bedtime, so that<br/>\n&gt; they can experience total exhaustion myself.

It helps if they can have someone stay up with them to <br/>\nhelp out - help them get snacks and drinks when they get too tired to <br/>\ndo that without making a mess, remind them to be quiet, help problem <br/>\nsolve, that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it still<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re getting enough sleep by the indicators the<br/>\n&gt; next day.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s more likely to happen if they&#39;re resisting going to bed - they <br/>\nwon&#39;t get enough sleep, bc being in control of *when* they go to bed <br/>\ntakes precedence over figuring out how much sleep they need, what <br/>\nfeels right to their bodies. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It also doesn&#39;t always work for them to sleep in for ages,<br/>\n&gt; because we sometimes get visitors about 9am <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can you hang out and talk quietly on the porch? If not, model being <br/>\ncourteous of others&#39; sleep: &quot;I&#39;m sorry, the kids are still asleep and <br/>\nI don&#39;t want to disturb them.&quot; If you start staying up late with the <br/>\nkids, call your friends and let them know that 9am is too early to <br/>\nvisit. I know two families of homeschoolers (not even unschoolers) <br/>\nthat I&#39;d never dream of calling before 10am, so 9 sounds awfully <br/>\nearly, unless the kids are really little. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Any suggestions for how to provide &quot;big boy<br/>\n&gt; time&quot; for the older kids (and sometimes we like to connect with them<br/>\n&gt; in this way, watching a movie that isn&#39;t really appropriate for the<br/>\n&gt; younger ones)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Set the younger kids up with a really fun game or movie *first* - you <br/>\ncan do that any time, not just late at night, too. It really helps to <br/>\nthink all &#39;round the clock, not just &quot;night is for adults&quot;. Watch a <br/>\nscary movie in the afternoon while the younger kids play outside. <br/>\nHang out with the older guys in the morning, while the younger are <br/>\nstill sleeping! Plan some nice breakfasts with foods the little ones <br/>\ndon&#39;t appreciate yet - work it in with dad&#39;s schedule, too, so he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get left out. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Oh, and of course there&#39;s always the issue that my husband just <br/>\n </span></blockquote>isn&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; open to the idea of totally free bedtimes.  He works shiftwork...  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>For<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; him, that peace and quiet definitely equals kids tucked up safely <br/>\n </span></blockquote>in bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is trickier. Its reasonable to say: you can stay up *if* you&#39;re <br/>\nquiet so dad can sleep. That&#39;s something that takes practice, and you <br/>\nbeing up with the kids to help them remember, but its doable - its <br/>\nharder if the kids are feeling pressured to go to bed at <br/>\nsome &quot;reasonable time&quot; though ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nDad wanting quiet time is the part that gets tricky. Can he get that <br/>\nin the bedroom with the door shut? Can you sit with him and chat for <br/>\na few minutes, if part of what he wants is some connection with you? <br/>\nAre there other times and ways he can get his needs met? Can you and <br/>\nhe go for a walk together when he gets home? I know its challenging <br/>\nto shift gears from work to home. Its challenging for the kids, too - <br/>\ndad&#39;s home, why can&#39;t we play with him? We&#39;ve waited All Day! Maybe <br/>\nyou can act as a buffer between kids and dad for a little while when <br/>\nhe gets in, so he has time to unwind. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I find it hard to know how everyone&#39;s needs can be met.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Everyone&#39;s needs can be met if some expectations can be let go. <br/>\nThat&#39;s the hard part. The expectations are standing in the way of <br/>\nproblem solving and reducing the matter to &quot;when do they go to bed.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nOne option - something to suggest, maybe, as an experiment - is to <br/>\nsomehow pick a &quot;bed time&quot; and then also work out a schedule for <br/>\nextending it. So, for example, maybe you&#39;d start with 11:30 and every <br/>\nweek add another half hour - or hour, if you like. Maybe it would be <br/>\na &quot;solid&quot; bedtime, or maybe just a guide for when mom and dad get to <br/>\nstart turning the lights down - that&#39;s something to think about, too. <br/>\nEither way, you&#39;d just about guarantee they&#39;d stay up good and late <br/>\nevery night for awhile - but on the other hand, you&#39;d Know it and <br/>\ncould plan around it. Work it into dad&#39;s shift schedule in some more <br/>\nconvenient way. Warn off the morning visitors in advance so you can <br/>\nsleep late, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe catch to all of this is that you need to be simultaneously <br/>\nlooking for other ways/times to connect with the older kids and for <br/>\ndad to have down time. I&#39;d talk about it with everyone in the family <br/>\nindividulally First, get input, get ideas - for all the issues <br/>\ninvolved. Don&#39;t expect it to all come together overnight (as it <br/>\nwere). Maybe come up with a variety of plans to try - do some <br/>\nexperimenting. Its really Okay to experiment! It can be pretty <br/>\nvalidating to kids, actually, to have parents say &quot;I&#39;m not sure if <br/>\nthis is a good idea, but can we try it as an experiment?&quot; It can help <br/>\nbuild a sense of partnership by breaking down the idea that adults <br/>\nare always supposed to know what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":161901986,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;gktbdm@...&gt;","profile":"gktbdm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Few Questions -- sleep","postDate":"1233873511","msgId":38215,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdtZnBwNytzZzExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdtODJpOSthY3E3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38170,"nextInTopic":38227,"prevInTime":38214,"nextInTime":38216,"topicId":37898,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for your reply Meredith.

I still have more questions though :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the idea of being able to alter apparent &quot;body clocks&quot;, the<br/>\nthing I&#39;ve noticed is that their preference for going to bed has got<br/>\nlater and later and later (probably coinciding with being &quot;allowed&quot; to<br/>\nstay up later and later and later lol).  And yet at some point we<br/>\nstill ask them to start getting ready for bed and so basically their<br/>\nfreedom does eventually come to an end.  Perhaps that is why they keep<br/>\npushing the boundary???  I&#39;d love to have the courage to &quot;let them&quot;<br/>\nstay up without my husband or I actually initiating bedtime, so that<br/>\nthey can experience total exhaustion myself.  I wonder if we did that<br/>\nfor a while, whether they&#39;d be more in tune with their own tiredness<br/>\nand start resisting bed less, but the fear is that they&#39;ll just get<br/>\nused to going to bed later and later, and the cycle will continue?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, whilst they can and do sleep in a bit sometimes (e.g. last night<br/>\nthey slept from about 11.30/12.00 til almost 9 this morning) it still<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re getting enough sleep by the indicators the<br/>\nnext day.  It also doesn&#39;t always work for them to sleep in for ages,<br/>\nbecause we sometimes get visitors about 9am (friends who might drop in<br/>\nafter delivering their kids to school).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and of course there&#39;s always the issue that my husband just isn&#39;t<br/>\nopen to the idea of totally free bedtimes.  He works shiftwork and I<br/>\nalways emphasise the importance of being quiet in the house when<br/>\nanyone is asleep, but when he gets home from an evening shift, he<br/>\nreally appreciates a quiet peaceful (kids in bed) house when he gets<br/>\nhome about 11pm, so he can relax.  And when he&#39;s on an early shift the<br/>\nnext day, he appreciates a bit of peace and quiet before turning in<br/>\nhimself, and he just can&#39;t stay up late if he&#39;s leaving at 6am.  For<br/>\nhim, that peace and quiet definitely equals kids tucked up safely in bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it hard to know how everyone&#39;s needs can be met.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the &quot;artificial&quot; stimulus of things like electronic media<br/>\nkeeping us awake later at night, I&#39;m aware of what you talk about, how<br/>\nanything really can draw us to stay up later than our bodyclocks would<br/>\nindicate is good for us - been there done that lol!!  I&#39;m a shocker at<br/>\nit myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut your comment that they&#39;re perhaps wanting to stay up late to be<br/>\npart of what is going on, to socialise with the family etc, is only<br/>\noccasionally true.  Sometimes, for my younger two (8 & 6) they resent<br/>\nbeing asked to go to bed when the older boys (15 & 12) are still up<br/>\ndoing things like xbox or computer.  They definitely resent the<br/>\nseeming &quot;injustice&quot; of it, yet the older boys are very quick to tell<br/>\nthem (not so nicely) that &quot;younger kids need more sleep&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s not<br/>\n&#39;normal&#39; for younger kids to stay up this late; ALL your friends have<br/>\nbeen in bed for hours!!&quot;.  Any suggestions for how to provide &quot;big boy<br/>\ntime&quot; for the older kids (and sometimes we like to connect with them<br/>\nin this way, watching a movie that isn&#39;t really appropriate for the<br/>\nyounger ones) but the younger two resent missing out?  I want to<br/>\nrespect the big boys wanting a &quot;break&quot; from the younger two, so they<br/>\ncan play xbox games that are much more violent, or watch scarier<br/>\nmovies, etc.  But I also want to respect the way that can make the<br/>\nyounger ones feel.  Sometimes my solution is to just focus on settling<br/>\nthe younger two down with long stories etc, in their room, while the<br/>\nolder boys do their stuff in the lounge room (sometimes with my<br/>\nhusband), but this doesn&#39;t always work.  Sometimes we just all stay up<br/>\nwatching a movie late together.  (But of course, at the end of that,<br/>\nwe always initiate moving the younger two towards bed.  They don&#39;t<br/>\nalways resist that, mind you, because there&#39;s a natural transition to<br/>\nbed after a movie, I find.)  To be honest, I&#39;m delighted when it IS a<br/>\ncase of them all wanting to hang out together.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s<br/>\njust not often that reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, it&#39;s become quite common for the big boys to put themselves<br/>\nto bed much earlier than the younger two.  (I know, I know, it&#39;s<br/>\ninteresting to see that the ones with the freedom to stay up or go to<br/>\nbed, often choose to go to bed quite early, wheras the younger two who<br/>\nare still &#39;asked to go to bed&#39; want to stay up as late as possible.) <br/>\nIn those cases, when the big boys are in bed, it&#39;s literally just a<br/>\ncase of the younger two wanting to play the computer or something and<br/>\nnot stop.  They have total freedom to do that during the day, so I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure why they find it so hard to stop, when it&#39;s late at night???<br/>\n Do you think it&#39;s because they&#39;re being &quot;told&quot; to go to bed and<br/>\nthey&#39;re just resisting that?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so long.  I&#39;m really keen to work this situation out in<br/>\na way that respects everybody&#39;s needs and desires, helps us fit into a<br/>\nsociety that sometimes includes phone calls and visits as early as<br/>\n8.30 or 9am, and so that there can be less tension and stress<br/>\nsurrounding the issue of sleep and bedtimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much for your advice already!<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren Lee<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Karen&quot; &lt;gktbdm@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ** Hey, I have a question about this.

Its a little unsettling for a week <br/>\n&gt; or two, while we rethink our morning and evening strategies. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I started work, over a year ago, I had to shift my sleep <br/>\n&gt; schedule to accomodate that. Since I was getting up before dawn, I <br/>\n&gt; found I needed an extra hour of sleep not to be groggy the next day. <br/>\n&gt; Now that I&#39;m laid off I&#39;m getting to sleep until dawn again, which <br/>\n&gt; means I actually need less sleep overall. Its weird.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; *** My 6 year old daughter, in particular, doesn&#39;t seem to sleep<br/>\n&gt; &gt; later, even when she has had a really late night.  Actually, she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; habitually stays up pretty late & gets up before others in the <br/>\n&gt; family,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and often seems cranky and tired.  Any ideas of how to deal with <br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; issue?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It all depends on what you mean by &quot;deal with this issue&quot; ;) I&#39;d work <br/>\n&gt; on the &quot;tired&quot; aspect - what can you do to make things a little <br/>\n&gt; easier on her when she&#39;s tired? Can you help her find calmer <br/>\n&gt; activities during the day? Work more &quot;down time&quot; into her day <br/>\n&gt; somehow? Tv? Baths? Some other calming activity? If nothing else, be <br/>\n&gt; aware of her tiredness as something to adjust for Not something to be <br/>\n&gt; irritated by, if you see what I mean? It doesn&#39;t help her or you to <br/>\n&gt; be annoyed at her tiredness. Helping her find ways to rest during the <br/>\n&gt; day, and ways to *allow* for her tiredness in the day&#39;s activities <br/>\n&gt; sets her up to be less cranky and, ultimately have more problem <br/>\n&gt; solving skills for when she *is* cranky. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do you think that TVs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; computers, etc could be considered &quot;artificial reasons&quot; to drive our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children to want to fight sleep. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It sounds more like the other people in the family are the reason for <br/>\n&gt; fighting sleep. I&#39;ve lived in a commune, in the middle of the woods, <br/>\n&gt; with no tv period and limited computer access. The adults still found <br/>\n&gt; reasons to stay up late - socializing, games, music... and the kids <br/>\n&gt; still found those to be good reasons to want to stay up, too. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve stayed up much later than my usual knitting, or quilting, or <br/>\n&gt; writing  by hand, no less! I&#39;ve gotten up in the middle of the night <br/>\n&gt; to read. When I was a kid I&#39;d read with a flashlight under the covers <br/>\n&gt; late at night, when I was &quot;supposed&quot; to be asleep. George stays up <br/>\n&gt; late playing music, or working in the shop. He&#39;ll get up in the <br/>\n&gt; middle of the night and work. Mo stays up late painting or playing <br/>\n&gt; with legos. Sometimes she&#39;ll stay up late reading to her stuffed <br/>\n&gt; toys. Ray will stay up late to socialize. He&#39;s been up all night <br/>\n&gt; talking more than once. Those are our passions. Sometimes passions <br/>\n&gt; keep you up late at night. That&#39;s a Good Thing.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyone else have any relevant experience with larger, mixed age<br/>\n&gt; &gt; families sharing one living room area, where there aren&#39;t options <br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the older kids to be off in a rec room somewhere, or something like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that.  When the living space with computers & TV etc are very close <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bedrooms, etc.  I&#39;d love to hear some success stories & strategies<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that I can try.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Headphones are wonderful things. We have a tiny house, and headphones <br/>\n&gt; help us all stay sane. We&#39;ve used soft music as a way to dull out the <br/>\n&gt; sound of conversation in another room  some people like white noise <br/>\n&gt; machines for that. We&#39;ve rearranged our living area with respect to <br/>\n&gt; the way sound travels. Speakers pointing away from the stairs make a <br/>\n&gt; Big Difference in our lives!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t help but wonder, though, given what you wrote, if that&#39;s not <br/>\n&gt; really the problem. It doesn&#39;t sound like people are being kept awake <br/>\n&gt; so much as are wanting to be included in things they already know are <br/>\n&gt; going on. Its Good that they want to be included! Its not just the <br/>\n&gt; techie toys, it&#39;s the conviviality they want. They want to hang out <br/>\n&gt; and have fun with the family  Hooray! That&#39;s not &quot;normal&quot; in modern, <br/>\n&gt; western culture bc we&#39;ve created this split between the worlds of <br/>\n&gt; adults and children. It *is* normal in a grander sense  in the sense <br/>\n&gt; of how human beings live and learn and relate to one another. Other <br/>\n&gt; families have to *make* time for the family to do things together, to <br/>\n&gt; resist the isolation that comes from our modern lifestyles. Your <br/>\n&gt; family  your kids! have found a way to enjoy being a family <br/>\n&gt; together. That&#39;s better than good.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (The night I wrote this, btw, my internet connection was balky so I <br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t send.

If nothing else, be <br/>\naware of her tiredness as something to adjust for Not something to be <br/>\nirritated by, if you see what I mean? It doesn&#39;t help her or you to <br/>\nbe annoyed at her tiredness. Helping her find ways to rest during the <br/>\nday, and ways to *allow* for her tiredness in the day&#39;s activities <br/>\nsets her up to be less cranky and, ultimately have more problem <br/>\nsolving skills for when she *is* cranky. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you think that TVs<br/>\n&gt; computers, etc could be considered &quot;artificial reasons&quot; to drive our<br/>\n&gt; children to want to fight sleep. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds more like the other people in the family are the reason for <br/>\nfighting sleep. I&#39;ve lived in a commune, in the middle of the woods, <br/>\nwith no tv period and limited computer access. The adults still found <br/>\nreasons to stay up late - socializing, games, music... and the kids <br/>\nstill found those to be good reasons to want to stay up, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve stayed up much later than my usual knitting, or quilting, or <br/>\nwriting  by hand, no less! I&#39;ve gotten up in the middle of the night <br/>\nto read. When I was a kid I&#39;d read with a flashlight under the covers <br/>\nlate at night, when I was &quot;supposed&quot; to be asleep. George stays up <br/>\nlate playing music, or working in the shop. He&#39;ll get up in the <br/>\nmiddle of the night and work. Mo stays up late painting or playing <br/>\nwith legos. Sometimes she&#39;ll stay up late reading to her stuffed <br/>\ntoys. Ray will stay up late to socialize. He&#39;s been up all night <br/>\ntalking more than once. Those are our passions. Sometimes passions <br/>\nkeep you up late at night. That&#39;s a Good Thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyone else have any relevant experience with larger, mixed age<br/>\n&gt; families sharing one living room area, where there aren&#39;t options <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the older kids to be off in a rec room somewhere, or something like<br/>\n&gt; that.

We have a tiny house, and headphones <br/>\nhelp us all stay sane. We&#39;ve used soft music as a way to dull out the <br/>\nsound of conversation in another room  some people like white noise <br/>\nmachines for that. We&#39;ve rearranged our living area with respect to <br/>\nthe way sound travels. Speakers pointing away from the stairs make a <br/>\nBig Difference in our lives!<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t help but wonder, though, given what you wrote, if that&#39;s not <br/>\nreally the problem. It doesn&#39;t sound like people are being kept awake <br/>\nso much as are wanting to be included in things they already know are <br/>\ngoing on. Its Good that they want to be included! Its not just the <br/>\ntechie toys, it&#39;s the conviviality they want. They want to hang out <br/>\nand have fun with the family  Hooray! That&#39;s not &quot;normal&quot; in modern, <br/>\nwestern culture bc we&#39;ve created this split between the worlds of <br/>\nadults and children. It *is* normal in a grander sense  in the sense <br/>\nof how human beings live and learn and relate to one another. Other <br/>\nfamilies have to *make* time for the family to do things together, to <br/>\nresist the isolation that comes from our modern lifestyles. Your <br/>\nfamily  your kids! have found a way to enjoy being a family <br/>\ntogether. That&#39;s better than good.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The night I wrote this, btw, my internet connection was balky so I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t send.

Do you think it&#39;s possible for<br/>\nsomeone&#39;s body clock to change?  For instance, I have this habit of<br/>\nstaying up until about 2am, catching up on all my unschooling emails<br/>\netc. I can usually sleep in the next morning because my kids are older<br/>\nnow (6, 8, 12 & 15), although i do sometimes get caught out with<br/>\nvisitors when I&#39;m still in bed or just up and still in my jammies! <br/>\nNow, I didn&#39;t USED to stay up until 2am.  It&#39;s a habit that&#39;s<br/>\ndeveloped over time because I enjoy the late night quiet hours for my<br/>\nreading. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe same with my children.  They&#39;ve gradually become habitually later<br/>\nand later to bed, but it&#39;s been a slow change (the two I&#39;m mostly<br/>\ntalking about are 6 & 8), so it&#39;s something that I feel could possibly<br/>\nbe helped to change back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wonder how much our apparent &quot;body clocks&quot; are influenced by<br/>\nthe exciting technological possibilities, that can tend to<br/>\nartificially stimulate our senses.  I know for me, that if I wasn&#39;t<br/>\nsitting here on the computer, I&#39;d probably be in bed reading a book,<br/>\nand I usually find I&#39;m more in touch with my tiredness when I do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m asking these questions to help me get my head around the whole<br/>\nsleep thing, because I want to respect my children in this, and I need<br/>\nto understand it better.  I also need to be able to help my husband<br/>\nunderstand it better, because he&#39;s much more inclined to &quot;put the<br/>\nchildren to bed&quot; at a time that he thinks is appropriate, because<br/>\nchildren &quot;should be in bed&quot; by a particular time.  It&#39;s not<br/>\nnecessarily to do with the time on the clock, but he will definitely<br/>\nmake comments such as &quot;It&#39;s not normal&quot; for children to be up this<br/>\nlate, or &quot;It&#39;s healthier to be asleep by about 10pm so you can sleep<br/>\nlonger in the dark hours & wake up in the sunlight hours&quot; (based on<br/>\nsome reading on health & wellness he&#39;s done).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; What would happen if they stayed up all night?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They&#39;d sleep later.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*** My 6 year old daughter, in particular, doesn&#39;t seem to sleep<br/>\nlater, even when she has had a really late night.

I&#39;ve only been on here a few days so I&#39;ve not read anything about <br/>\nchores.  I have some medical issues and some days I just can not do a lot.  <br/>\nRight now we have a chore list but after a while of doing the same chores they <br/>\nget bored.  I can understand.  They&#39;ve also come to realize that there are some <br/>\nthings that they just don&#39;t like doing as far as chores go.  How do you handle <br/>\nchores?  A list?  Let them do what they want?  My dd - I hate to say it - but <br/>\nshe is quite lazy and will walk over a pile of dirty clothes rather than put it <br/>\nin the hamper or, God forbid, throw it in the washing machine.  We told her a <br/>\nyear or so back that we would not tell her how to keep her room.  If she chose <br/>\nto clean it, fine, if not, fine.  The only stipulation we put on that is she <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t leave food/dishes (bugs) in the room and we&#39;d like her to pick up her <br/>\nlaundry and put it in the laundry room because after a while it starts to smell.  <br/>\nOther than that we&#39;ve got various chores from folding a load of laundry to <br/>\nemptying the dishwasher, etc.  How do you handle chores?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do a site search for &quot;chores,&quot; you&#39;ll have pages and pages to read. It&#39;s a VERY common question here. You can also look on Joyce&#39;s and Sandra&#39;s sites for even more on chores. www.sandradodd.com and www.joyfullyrejoycing.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thi<br/>\nng I&#39;d suggest is to not call your daughter &quot;lazy&quot;---here or anywhere else. She&#39;s only 11. She doesn&#39;t have the same need for neatness that you do. It&#39;ll come...when she&#39;s ready----and usually as *soon* as you quit worrying about it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have chores. If something needs to be done, someone does it. More than likely, it falls on me, my husband, or my older son. I really don&#39;t expect much in the way of housekeeping from my 12 year old. But if I ask him to do something, he usually does it. But it&#39;s a *question*---and he doesn&#39;t have to say yes. But I rarely hear &quot;no.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf something bothers one of us, *that* person cleans it up. It&#39;s never someone else&#39;s responsibility. I feel we model responsibility by being responsible. *I* am responsible for my house, my children, my pets, my car, my garden. The more *I* care for those things, the more my children see how important it is to care for the things you love. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nToo many people won&#39;t even clean up their own trash because they figure someone else will do it. &quot;It&#39;s not their job.&quot; The idea that children must clean up their own messes is what I believe causes that. I think we should clean up because we *care*---not because it&#39;s someone else&#39;s mess. So I lovingly clean up. A lot. &lt;g&gt; The outcome of that is that my boys *ALSO* lovingly clean up. A lot. Not because we have a chore list or because I make them, but because they want to care for our environment, they like clean clothes, they love our pets<br/>\n.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for who does what around here: we all have things we prefer to do and things we&#39;re not wild about. I like loading the dishwasher, but I hate to unload and put away. Cam loves to put away, but would rather wash by hand than load the washer. &lt;g&gt; We team up. &lt;g&gt; Cameron&#39;s my recycle nut: he chooses to take the trash out because he knows he&#39;ll do a better job of sorting recyclables than Ben or I will. Everyone likes to cook. Nobody does windows. &lt;BWG&gt; I pay someone now (ever other week) to scrub bathrooms, clean the kitchen, dust, vacuum, and mop. I LOVE not having to worry about that any more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve cleaned the boys&#39; rooms for years. Now I never clean Cam&#39;s room---and it&#39;s always spotless. I still clean Dunc&#39;s room for him. He LOVES when it&#39;s neat and organized. He&#39;s VERY grateful when he comes home to a clean room---it&#39;s so much more peaceful, he says. Whenever the den or kitchen is overwhelming, someone starts picking up and wiping down; others join in. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI get the health issues. But what would you do if you had no children? You&#39;d still have laundry to do, toilets to scrub, and supper to prepare. Dishes don&#39;t clean themselves. Carpets still need vacuuming. Having children doesn&#39;t man getting slave labor. &lt;G&gt; Who would be cleaning your house if you had no children? OR---what if your children were disabled in some way and couldn&#39;t do the work for you? Who would be caring for the house AND them then?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do what needs to be done. We=2<br/>\n0can choose to whine about how hard it is or about how it&#39;s always messy, but what&#39;s that modeling? I want my boys to see me lovingly and joyfully caring for them. I hope they&#39;ll do the same for their kids.

I&#39;ve been reading the WoW thread with interest.  I do have to say <br/>\nthat my viewpoint on video games has changed just since being on this list for a <br/>\nfew days.  I was one of those moms that hated video games.  We have a 360, Wii, <br/>\n2 DSs and 2 PSPs.  My kids were allowed to play only on the weekends and only if <br/>\nthey got their schoolwork and chores done during the week.  However, after <br/>\nreading quite a few of these posts, I&#39;ve done a complete 180.  My son wants to <br/>\nbe a video game designer and it&#39;s like a lightbulb went off when I read <br/>\nsomething about pursuing what they&#39;re passionate in and helping them develop the <br/>\nskills that they want to pursue.  I was almost like &quot;Duh!&quot; if he wants to do <br/>\nthat for a living he needs to see how the various engines work, etc.  So now, <br/>\nhubby and I are trying to decide, again, where the balance is.  On the weekends, <br/>\nhe literally plays from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed (unless we&#39;d <br/>\nlike to watch something on tv - the tv in the living room is the only one with <br/>\nthe game systems on it).  They also have iPods that they download various <br/>\ntelevision shows on (Mythbusters, Mystery Diagnosis).  I&#39;m guessing that he <br/>\nprobably plays so much on the weekends because that is the only time he gets to.  <br/>\nHe has actually said that he wants to get in as much time as he can on the <br/>\nweekends because its (t<br/>\no him) such a short time.  So, we&#39;d like to give him more <br/>\naccess, but how much?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt IS A short time!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s your passion?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your husband limited *you* the way your children are limited, how would you feel? Wouldn&#39;t you *live* for the weekends? Wouldn&#39;t you plan your week so that on Saturdays you would do *only* that from sun-up to sun-down? Would you want to quit your passion to go to something with your husband? Or would you choose to ignore him (and whatever cool outing he had planned) because your time was soooo limited that you had to FILL Saturday with your passion because you wouldn&#39;t get that chance for a whole WEEK?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much access would be enough?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would you do if your time were ...again...ARBITRARILY limited? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are *natural* limits: I&#39;m a freakishly passionate gardener. Winter is down-time, of course, but I&#39;m still planning, reading seed catalogues, building new beds, dreaming. &lt;g&gt; But I&#39;m not actually *out* there, planting or picking. The *natural* limit is that it&#39;s too cold right now. I&#39;m also naturally limited in gardening, even in the summer, by darkness and trips out of town and playing with my children and painting the deck and.... Other things may stop me from gardening, but there&#39;s no one lording over me, saying that I&#39;ve had enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan has NO Limits with gaming. There are days when he&#39;s playing from dawn &#39;til dusk. But just this week he got a new deck of Magic, <br/>\nthe Gathering cards, and didn&#39;t play a game all day. He was busy learning the rules and comparing cards and looking up info on the computer. We&#39;ve had friends in from Rhode Island this week: they&#39;ve been playing and going for walks, and listening to music. We&#39;re at the water park next week: he&#39;ll have his gaming computer with him, but he&#39;ll be running around the water park with friends all week---and probably too busy to play much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe deal is: he can CHOOSE whether to play or not because he *can*. If I limited his playing to weekends, I could guarantee that, on weekends, that&#39;s ALL he&#39;d do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nParents are convinced that their children are addicted to gaming because they allow the children to game only on the weekends, and---surprise!---the children play non-stop on weekends---to the exclusion of all else. DUH! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf allowed free rein, they *will* choose to do other things. But if controlled, they NEED to get in every single *second* allowed them---and sneak in more when they can. So it *looks* like an &quot;addiction.&quot; But, really, the parents have just set up this situation by limiting them too harshly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad you&#39;ve seen the benefits of letting him have more time for his passions. I&#39;ll warn you: if you decide to allow more time, he&#39;ll take every single MINUTE! It will probably look like he&#39;s &quot;addicted.&quot; Because he&#39;s been limited, he&#39;ll probably not quite trust that you&#39;re serious, so he&#39;ll be *hoarding* his gaming time, thinking you&#39;ll take it away again. But if20you&#39;re patient, he&#39;ll level back out and want to do other things too. Even on Saturdays. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh---I&#39;d also consider a second TV. It&#39;ll make life easier! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"Kelly Lovejoy","from":"Kelly Lovejoy &lt;kbcdlovejo@...&gt;","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] bedtime questions","postDate":"1232707109","msgId":38060,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQjRCNURERDRBQ0VBOS1EMDQtMUQzRUB3ZWJtYWlsLXN0Zy1kMDcuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDczQTA0MUU1QkZGQzQ0MURCMUNFRTI3QTMwQzgzQzI5QENsb3VkRmFtaWx5UEM+","referencesHeader":"PDczQTA0MUU1QkZGQzQ0MURCMUNFRTI3QTMwQzgzQzI5QENsb3VkRmFtaWx5UEM+"},"prevInTopic":38013,"nextInTopic":38061,"prevInTime":38059,"nextInTime":38061,"topicId":37898,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;ve read a few times about &quot;arbitrary&quot; bed times, <br/>\ntime on video games and/or other things and I&#39;m wondering what that means.  Do <br/>\nyou mean just throwing a time out there with no thoughts?  My son has a bedtime <br/>\nof 10:00 and my daughter of 10:30.  On weekends they have an extra 1/2 an hour.  <br/>\nGranted, this is a hold-over from the schooling days, so it could possibly be <br/>\nchanged.  We sometimes let our kids have what we call &quot;movie nights&quot; or we let <br/>\nthem stay up as late as they want.  I don&#39;t understand what can be done at 3 <br/>\na.m. that can&#39;t be done a 10 a.m., but I digress.  My son is always asking &quot;can <br/>\nwe stay up late tonight?&quot; and I honestly get tired of that question.  Kids need <br/>\ntheir rest, so I don&#39;t want to let them stay up all night - where&#39;s the balance?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAn &quot;arbitrary bedtime&quot; is when the parent decides that the child must be in bed at a certain time. It doesn&#39;t take into consideration when the child is tired---it just *is*.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have arbitrary bedtimes. The time the children are expected to be in bed is under *your* control.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that children need their rest. So do adults! But it works better for *each* body to learn to detect *when* its tired and in need of sleep. When someone else makes those decisions *for* us, we eventually can&#39;t *feel* when we&#39;re tired.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour  &quot;I don&#39;t understand what can be do<br/>\nne at 3 a.m. that can&#39;t be done a 10 a.m.&quot;  sounds as if it&#39;s right out of your parent&#39;s mouth. &lt;g&gt; Are you just regurgitating, or have you actually *thought* about it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m up now, at 5:00 am. I went to bed at 9:00 because I was tired. I have a house full of company, but I was too tired to stay up any later. Unfortunately, I awoke at 1:30, watched TV until 4:00, went back to bed and tried to go back to sleep until 4:30---and now I&#39;m UP and writing to you. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that a big part of my sleep issues are because of my VERY strict bedtimes as a child. I feel that I&#39;m getting over them (that&#39;s why I *chose* to  go to bed at 9:00), but I still struggle with being IN bed and not sleeping. My parents also believed that children need rest and that parents need &quot;adult time&quot;---so I was sent to bed at 7:00 as a toddler, 7:30 as a first grader, 8:00 as a fourth grader, and 9:00 as a sixth grader. If I took an our nap in the afternoon, I was allowed to stay up one half hour later at night. Two hour nap? An hour later. By the time I was 13 or so, they couldn&#39;t control that, and I would stay up until 2:00,3:00, even 5:00 reading, but I was deliriously tired the whole next day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, bed is STILL a place to stare at the ceiling until exhausted. I just can&#39;t DO that any more, so I just get up and do *something* until I&#39;m exhausted enough to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, it&#39;s just not healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger chil<br/>\nd (almost 13) doesn&#39;t have that hanging over his head. (Cameron (21 toDAY!) does: unthinkingly,we imposed the same bedtime schedule on him that *I* had as a child! Ugh!) Duncan truly sleeps when tired, awakes when refreshed. He doesn&#39;t struggle with sleep at ALL. He KNOWS his body&#39;s cues. Very, very cool. NOT that he doesn&#39;t push it---sometimes he&#39;s having just too much fun to go to sleep, but he knows to alter a few things to &quot;realign&quot; himself after the excitement&#39;s over.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMany schooled children have to get up as early as 6:00am, so I get why &quot;earlier to bed&quot; would be helpful---they DO need rest, and they aren&#39;t allowed to sleep in or to nap when tired. But my unschooled children can sleep as long as they need to in the morning, so they get PLENTY of rest. Plus, mine can nap at any time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTweens/teens often go through a biological switch, when their bodies refuse to sleep when it&#39;s dark. They just *can&#39;t* get to sleep until daylight. I wonder whether that&#39;s a survival thang left over from cave times: they were the night guards. &lt;g&gt; And I believe that&#39;s why schooled teens get *such* a bad rap: they are truly EXHAUSTED because school interferes with their natural sleep schedule, so they are terribly sleep-deprived. If *we* kept their schedule, we&#39;d be grumpy too!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much better to let them discover their bodies&#39; natural rhythms! Not only will they be happier children, they&#39;ll be happier adults! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll address the other concerns in different emails.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=0<br/>\nA~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":291997784,"authorName":"Brad Holcomb","from":"&quot;Brad Holcomb&quot; &lt;list.brad@...&gt;","profile":"bholcomb48","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Columbia, SC","postDate":"1232561822","msgId":38013,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5Nzc2NmExLjFjMDc4ZTBhLjY0MjYuNTdiOEBteC5nb29nbGUuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMjY4ODY0MjgtMTIzMjU1MTUxNy1jYXJkaHVfZGVjb21ib2J1bGF0b3JfYmxhY2tiZXJyeS5yaW0ubmV0LTExNDMyNzk2ODktQGJ4ZTExNC5iaXN4LnByb2Qub24uYmxhY2tiZXJyeT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":38010,"nextInTopic":38060,"prevInTime":38012,"nextInTime":38014,"topicId":37898,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I worked for Palmetto Health in Columbia for 8 months in 2003-2004, flying in Mon-Thurs most weeks.

I consider that we give him a lot of<br/>\nroom to be, but I know we hold on to a fair number of prescribed ways of<br/>\nbeing that we find difficult to shake.  Thanks again for your thoughtful and<br/>\ninsightful responses.<br/>\n<br/>\nRespectfully,<br/>\nKaren James.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Jan 19, 2009 at 7:10 AM, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Jan 18, 2009, at 6:54 PM, Michelle Cloud wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Okay, onto my questions. I&#39;ve read a few times about &quot;arbitrary&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bed times, time on video games and/or other things and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wondering what that means. Do you mean just throwing a time out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there with no thoughts? My son has a bedtime of 10:00 and my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; daughter of 10:30. On weekends they have an extra 1/2 an hour.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Granted, this is a hold-over from the schooling days, so it could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; possibly be changed. We sometimes let our kids have what we call<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;movie nights&quot; or we let them stay up as late as they want.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t understand what can be done at 3 a.m. that can&#39;t be done a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 10 a.m., but I digress.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually it&#39;s an important question. And the reason you aren&#39;t seeing<br/>\n&gt; the answer is that you know what the answer is for you and can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; understand why or how it could be any different for anyone else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some people are night owls. If you read here long enough, you&#39;ll hear<br/>\n&gt; stories of adults who were sent to bed at bed time and tried each<br/>\n&gt; night to sleep but just couldn&#39;t. They&#39;d lie there *every night*<br/>\n&gt; until 1 or 2 when *their* bodies wanted to sleep. As much as their<br/>\n&gt; parents tried to make them be the way the parents thought was right,<br/>\n&gt; it just didn&#39;t work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If someone&#39;s body is naturally on a different schedule, 10 AM to them<br/>\n&gt; is like 2 AM to you. Their energy and mental gears are going on a<br/>\n&gt; different schedule. You might be zippiest at 11 AM and winding down<br/>\n&gt; at 8 PM. What if your body felt differently. What if you were<br/>\n&gt; naturally zippy at 8 PM and draggy at 11 AM and your husband dragged<br/>\n&gt; you around at 11AM to get things done when you were drained and sat<br/>\n&gt; down for a relaxing evening at 8 PM for reading or TV and you were<br/>\n&gt; ready to dance?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you read here long enough, you&#39;ll see that body clocks are what<br/>\n&gt; they are and no amount of external force can change them. People can<br/>\n&gt; *choose* to adapt *themselves*. If they really want a job that starts<br/>\n&gt; at 8AM, they can find ways to function. Or they can find a night job.<br/>\n&gt; But it&#39;s not something someone can impose on them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kids need their rest, so I don&#39;t want to let them stay up all night<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - where&#39;s the balance?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What would happen if they stayed up all night?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They&#39;d sleep later.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If people need something, they find a way to get it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re looking too short term. While sleep is a good thing, that<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean rigidly in bed at 10 PM for 8 hours each night gives<br/>\n&gt; someone a ticket to health. Kids *will* push their boundaries to find<br/>\n&gt; out their limits. They will push their boundaries when something even<br/>\n&gt; better is making it worth putting up with some negatives. For<br/>\n&gt; instance, staying up all night to play a new video game will be<br/>\n&gt; *well* worth giving up sleep for. But this isn&#39;t going to damage<br/>\n&gt; their health. Eventually what the game returns won&#39;t be fascinating<br/>\n&gt; enough to overcome the tiredness. This shouldn&#39;t be seen as a lesson<br/>\n&gt; learned so won&#39;t ever happen again. The goal isn&#39;t to teach them<br/>\n&gt; sleep is important. The goal is to remove the obstacles that get in<br/>\n&gt; the way of sleep. But sometimes they *will* choose to give up sleep<br/>\n&gt; when there&#39;s something more important going on. The trick is not to<br/>\n&gt; create things that seem more important by making staying up late be<br/>\n&gt; something desired.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t helping them get enough sleep. You&#39;ve changed<br/>\n&gt; the problem into getting them to sleep at the time you&#39;ve chosen. And<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re treating the two problems (enough sleep, sleeping at 10 PM) as<br/>\n&gt; though they were the same.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Where things go wrong for new unschoolers is that they hear &quot;let them<br/>\n&gt; sleep when they&#39;re tired&quot; and they let go of bedtimes. What happens<br/>\n&gt; is: 1) the kids are so jazzed at not having to sleep that they push<br/>\n&gt; themselves to exhaustion and have a hard time falling asleep and 2)<br/>\n&gt; the kids are up at 2 AM while the parents sleep and the mom is<br/>\n&gt; uncomfortable with that (or the kids get loud at night and wake<br/>\n&gt; everyone) and she doesn&#39;t know what to do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The goal is to help them figure out what sleepy feels like and help<br/>\n&gt; them fall asleep when they choose to. To do that you remove the<br/>\n&gt; obstacles and artificial reasons that are driving them to want to<br/>\n&gt; fight sleep. That doesn&#39;t mean that they will always choose to sleep<br/>\n&gt; when sleepy. It means that they will be able to recognize when<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re tired and then be able to decide for this moment whether<br/>\n&gt; staying up is more important than sleep. Right now they aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; learning how to choose. They&#39;re learning that the clock (and parents)<br/>\n&gt; dictate when sleep happens.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *One* way is to wind down the house starting at 8. Lower lights. Do<br/>\n&gt; quieter things. Get a routine in. Bath. Reading. But don&#39;t make sleep<br/>\n&gt; mandatory. The goal is to wind the house down so others can sleep if<br/>\n&gt; they want to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That is *not* a formula for success. ;-) It works well in some homes,<br/>\n&gt; and fails in others. It depends on your kids. *Some* families find a<br/>\n&gt; mintramp set up in front of the TV or wherever the family is gathered<br/>\n&gt; helps the kids get the zings out of their system. Obviously the total<br/>\n&gt; opposite of the above ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are *lots* of techniques that families try out for size. If you<br/>\n&gt; type bedtime into the archive search of the list, you&#39;ll find lots.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where&#39;s the balance?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Where&#39;s the balance? Inside of them trying to find its own way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Think of the balance of riding a bike. You can ride with them as<br/>\n&gt; littles on the back of your bike but you can&#39;t give them your<br/>\n&gt; balance. The only way they can find their own is to do it on their<br/>\n&gt; own and try a lot of different things until they find what&#39;s right<br/>\n&gt; *for them*. And then, and only then, do they ride.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sleep balance, and lots of other balances like food and video game<br/>\n&gt; playing, are a bit different. There isn&#39;t just one way of doing it<br/>\n&gt; and sometimes the balance will only be seen in the long term, not the<br/>\n&gt; short term. I think the more useful question in terms of creating an<br/>\n&gt; environment where they can explore freely without balance chaining<br/>\n&gt; them to a single answer is &quot;How can we balance family life with free<br/>\n&gt; exploration?&quot; In terms of mindful parenting and unschooling, your<br/>\n&gt; goal isn&#39;t to find their balance for them, but to make the<br/>\n&gt; environment safe for them to explore in, and help them find options<br/>\n&gt; that don&#39;t trample on the toes of others. Give them the freedom to<br/>\n&gt; find their own balance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My son is always asking &quot;can we stay up late tonight?&quot; and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; honestly get tired of that question.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is where you&#39;re setting yourself up for greater difficulties if<br/>\n&gt; you want to shift your goal to helping them sleep when they&#39;re tired<br/>\n&gt; instead of making them sleep on the schedule you think is necessary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re creating staying up as a really cool desirable thing. If you<br/>\n&gt; were to let them stay up they&#39;d want to stay up later and later and<br/>\n&gt; all night even because it&#39;s this wonderful thing you&#39;re handing out<br/>\n&gt; in rare bits like diamonds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When kids know they can choose to stay up late any night they want,<br/>\n&gt; it loses its luster. So if the reason they want to stay up is because<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re making it into a treat, when they know they can stay up any<br/>\n&gt; night they want, it&#39;s not a big deal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But *don&#39;t* just remove bedtimes for a free for all!

The  <br/>\n&gt; only stipulation we put on that is she couldn&#39;t leave food/dishes  <br/>\n&gt; (bugs) in the room and we&#39;d like her to pick up her laundry and put  <br/>\n&gt; it in the laundry room because after a while it starts to smell.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s helpful for a relationship for kids rooms to belong to  <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s also helpful to offer to clean it up for them  <br/>\noccasionally when the muse strikes you. Kids can easily create a mess  <br/>\nthat&#39;s overwhelming.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could literally see the change in the way my daughter viewed  <br/>\nturning chaos into order as she moved into her preteen years. I would  <br/>\nsometimes ask if she&#39;d match socks or fold kitchen towels and it was  <br/>\nlike I asked her to run a marathon. But we let it go. What looked to  <br/>\nus like a small task was to her large.

Another way is to make this an if/then deal. She can eat in  <br/>\nher room if she brings the plates out. If she can&#39;t remember, she  <br/>\nneeds to eat in the kitchen. That&#39;s a hard concept to explain because  <br/>\nit sounds like conventional parenting. It&#39;s *not* a rule. Eating only  <br/>\nin the kitchen is *not* a punishment. It&#39;s just the deal.

You can though make the  <br/>\nenvironment pleasant for him (and the rest of the family!) for him to  <br/>\nexplore freely. In the process he will find a balance. The balance  <br/>\nwill change over time. Right now, the balance is to suck in as much  <br/>\nas he can. That *will* level off, though not on your schedule. Let go  <br/>\nof expecting him to play only to the point where you think he&#39;s had  <br/>\nenough. His balance may always be off of what you expect. But he  <br/>\nwon&#39;t be playing 12 hours a day for the rest of his life. He *will*  <br/>\nfind a balance if you&#39;re not pushing and pulling at him to impose  <br/>\nyour idea of balance on him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, again, this is where we&#39;re miscommunicating. Creating an  <br/>\nenvironment for him to freely explore in doesn&#39;t mean releasing him  <br/>\nto the TV and waiting for him to resurface. Stay connected to him.  <br/>\nPlay with him for a while. (It doesn&#39;t mean as long as he does! Play  <br/>\nfor enjoyment and play to help you understand what fascinates him so  <br/>\nmuch). Talk about the games. Buy gaming guides. Help him find  <br/>\nwalkthroughs. Bring him food.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvolve him in family plans. Treat the gaming seriously as though he  <br/>\nwere working on Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem. When he feels that you&#39;re  <br/>\nhelping him do what involves him he won&#39;t need to fight to get the  <br/>\ntime to do it. When he feels you&#39;re helping him, he&#39;ll have the  <br/>\nability to help you by making some accommodations for the rest of the  <br/>\nfamily. (This might take longer than you&#39;d think. If he&#39;s had to  <br/>\nstruggle to get what he wants, if you now start helping him and  <br/>\ntreating his interests seriously, he&#39;s not going to *feel* the trust  <br/>\nfor a good long while. You have to rebuild it. And rebuilding trust  <br/>\nrequires being trustworthy for a good long while.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway what I was going to say is involve him in making family plans.  <br/>\nIf there&#39;s a dentist appointment at 10, approach it with &quot;Let&#39;s see  <br/>\nhow we can make this work so both can fit in,&quot; rather than the  <br/>\nstandard parenting practice of making the kid stop the trivial  <br/>\nplaying for the important adult imposed things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On the weekends, he literally plays from the moment he wakes up  <br/>\n&gt; until he goes to bed (unless we&#39;d like to watch something on tv -  <br/>\n&gt; the tv in the living<br/>\n&gt;  room is the only one with the game systems on it).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d seriously consider getting another TV for the games if it&#39;s a  <br/>\nproblem. Kids can&#39;t choose to watch TV with the family if the choice  <br/>\nis made for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m guessing that he probably plays so much on the weekends because  <br/>\n&gt; that is the only time he gets to.  He has actually said that he  <br/>\n&gt; wants to get in as much time as he can on the weekends because its  <br/>\n&gt; (to him) such a short time.  So, we&#39;d like to give him more access,  <br/>\n&gt; but how much?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, you&#39;re creating a rare commodity for him. If kids are given an  <br/>\nhour of TV each day, very likely they will watch for that hour  <br/>\nwhether they love the program or not and try to squeeze out even more  <br/>\nbecause that time is so rare and precious. When kids are given the  <br/>\nfreedom to turn on the TV, they can choose not to watch because there  <br/>\nisn&#39;t anything they want to watch. TV is just another choice in their  <br/>\nlife like books and crafting and skateboarding.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian wrote a really good post on this:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.html\">http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere are certain ages, usually transition ages when kids brains are  <br/>\nshifting and seeing the world in a new way, when they can watch a lot  <br/>\nof TV (and play a lot of video games).

So they kind of just hold on and go  <br/>\nthrough the motions until the kids are released into high school ;-)  <br/>\nMy daughter watched a *lot* of TV then and played a lot of games. She  <br/>\nwas between kid interests and more grown up interests and feeling out  <br/>\nthe new possibilities. Which *looked* like doing nothing but it was  <br/>\nall internal rearrangement work. It *is* a hard period for parents!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they do come out of it. At 17 she doesn&#39;t have enough time in her  <br/>\nbusy schedule to keep the DVR free ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat helped was getting a DVR so that she could set it to record the  <br/>\nprograms she wanted. That way she didn&#39;t feel chained to the TV by  <br/>\nthe station&#39;s schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Few Questions -- sleep","postDate":"1232367010","msgId":37908,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM2NDkxNzVFLUU3NzgtNEM5NS1BQkI4LUUxRTc5ODY4QzVGOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDczQTA0MUU1QkZGQzQ0MURCMUNFRTI3QTMwQzgzQzI5QENsb3VkRmFtaWx5UEM+","referencesHeader":"PDczQTA0MUU1QkZGQzQ0MURCMUNFRTI3QTMwQzgzQzI5QENsb3VkRmFtaWx5UEM+"},"prevInTopic":37898,"nextInTopic":37909,"prevInTime":37907,"nextInTime":37909,"topicId":37898,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And the reason you aren&#39;t seeing  <br/>\nthe answer is that you know what the answer is for you and can&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand why or how it could be any different for anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are night owls. If you read here long enough, you&#39;ll hear  <br/>\nstories of adults who were sent to bed at bed time and tried each  <br/>\nnight to sleep but just couldn&#39;t. They&#39;d lie there *every night*  <br/>\nuntil 1 or 2 when *their* bodies wanted to sleep. As much as their  <br/>\nparents tried to make them be the way the parents thought was right,  <br/>\nit just didn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone&#39;s body is naturally on a different schedule, 10 AM to them  <br/>\nis like 2 AM to you. Their energy and mental gears are going on a  <br/>\ndifferent schedule. You might be zippiest at 11 AM and winding down  <br/>\nat 8 PM. What if your body felt differently. What if you were  <br/>\nnaturally zippy at 8 PM and draggy at 11 AM and your husband dragged  <br/>\nyou around at 11AM to get things done when you were drained and sat  <br/>\ndown for a relaxing evening at 8 PM for reading or TV and you were  <br/>\nready to dance?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you read here long enough, you&#39;ll see that body clocks are what  <br/>\nthey are and no amount of external force can change them. People can  <br/>\n*choose* to adapt *themselves*. If they really want a job that starts  <br/>\nat 8AM, they can find ways to function. Or they can find a night job.  <br/>\nBut it&#39;s not something someone can impose on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kids need their rest, so I don&#39;t want to let them stay up all night  <br/>\n&gt; - where&#39;s the balance?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What would happen if they stayed up all night?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;d sleep later.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people need something, they find a way to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re looking too short term. While sleep is a good thing, that  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean rigidly in bed at 10 PM for 8 hours each night gives  <br/>\nsomeone a ticket to health. Kids *will* push their boundaries to find  <br/>\nout their limits. They will push their boundaries when something even  <br/>\nbetter is making it worth putting up with some negatives. For  <br/>\ninstance, staying up all night to play a new video game will be  <br/>\n*well* worth giving up sleep for. But this isn&#39;t going to damage  <br/>\ntheir health. Eventually what the game returns won&#39;t be fascinating  <br/>\nenough to overcome the tiredness. This shouldn&#39;t be seen as a lesson  <br/>\nlearned so won&#39;t ever happen again. The goal isn&#39;t to teach them  <br/>\nsleep is important. The goal is to remove the obstacles that get in  <br/>\nthe way of sleep. But sometimes they *will* choose to give up sleep  <br/>\nwhen there&#39;s something more important going on. The trick is not to  <br/>\ncreate things that seem more important by making staying up late be  <br/>\nsomething desired.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t helping them get enough sleep. You&#39;ve changed  <br/>\nthe problem into getting them to sleep at the time you&#39;ve chosen. And  <br/>\nyou&#39;re treating the two problems (enough sleep, sleeping at 10 PM) as  <br/>\nthough they were the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere things go wrong for new unschoolers is that they hear &quot;let them  <br/>\nsleep when they&#39;re tired&quot; and they let go of bedtimes. What happens  <br/>\nis: 1) the kids are so jazzed at not having to sleep that they push  <br/>\nthemselves to exhaustion and have a hard time falling asleep and 2)  <br/>\nthe kids are up at 2 AM while the parents sleep and the mom is  <br/>\nuncomfortable with that (or the kids get loud at night and wake  <br/>\neveryone) and she doesn&#39;t know what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal is to help them figure out what sleepy feels like and help  <br/>\nthem fall asleep when they choose to. To do that you remove the  <br/>\nobstacles and artificial reasons that are driving them to want to  <br/>\nfight sleep. That doesn&#39;t mean that they will always choose to sleep  <br/>\nwhen sleepy. It means that they will be able to recognize when  <br/>\nthey&#39;re tired and then be able to decide for this moment whether  <br/>\nstaying up is more important than sleep. Right now they aren&#39;t  <br/>\nlearning how to choose. They&#39;re learning that the clock (and parents)  <br/>\ndictate when sleep happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n*One* way is to wind down the house starting at 8. Lower lights. Do  <br/>\nquieter things. Get a routine in. Bath. Reading. But don&#39;t make sleep  <br/>\nmandatory. The goal is to wind the house down so others can sleep if  <br/>\nthey want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is *not* a formula for success. ;-) It works well in some homes,  <br/>\nand fails in others. It depends on your kids. *Some* families find a  <br/>\nmintramp set up in front of the TV or wherever the family is gathered  <br/>\nhelps the kids get the zings out of their system. Obviously the total  <br/>\nopposite of the above ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are *lots* of techniques that families try out for size. If you  <br/>\ntype bedtime into the archive search of the list, you&#39;ll find lots.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; where&#39;s the balance?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Where&#39;s the balance? Inside of them trying to find its own way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of the balance of riding a bike. You can ride with them as  <br/>\nlittles on the back of your bike but you can&#39;t give them your  <br/>\nbalance. The only way they can find their own is to do it on their  <br/>\nown and try a lot of different things until they find what&#39;s right  <br/>\n*for them*. And then, and only then, do they ride.<br/>\n<br/>\nSleep balance, and lots of other balances like food and video game  <br/>\nplaying, are a bit different. There isn&#39;t just one way of doing it  <br/>\nand sometimes the balance will only be seen in the long term, not the  <br/>\nshort term. I think the more useful question in terms of creating an  <br/>\nenvironment where they can explore freely without balance chaining  <br/>\nthem to a single answer is &quot;How can we balance family life with free  <br/>\nexploration?&quot; In terms of mindful parenting and unschooling, your  <br/>\ngoal isn&#39;t to find their balance for them, but to make the  <br/>\nenvironment safe for them to explore in, and help them find options  <br/>\nthat don&#39;t trample on the toes of others. Give them the freedom to  <br/>\nfind their own balance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My son is always asking &quot;can we stay up late tonight?&quot; and I  <br/>\n&gt; honestly get tired of that question.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is where you&#39;re setting yourself up for greater difficulties if  <br/>\nyou want to shift your goal to helping them sleep when they&#39;re tired  <br/>\ninstead of making them sleep on the schedule  you think is necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re creating staying up as a really cool desirable thing. If you  <br/>\nwere to let them stay up they&#39;d want to stay up later and later and  <br/>\nall night even because it&#39;s this wonderful thing you&#39;re handing out  <br/>\nin rare bits like diamonds.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids know they can choose to stay up late any night they want,  <br/>\nit loses its luster.

I am a full-time college student pursuing a double major in History and Humanities.  I should be done by the end of this year.  We are a military family (Navy) stationed in Naples, Italy.  I&#39;ve been homeschooling for 8 years and have just recently (like in the last week or two) started unschooling.  I&#39;ve been reading tons and trying to find out as much as I can but some things just still seem unclear to me.  I do have to say, though, that as soon as we started doing this, I felt a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.  No more spending hours scheduling, no more &quot;you have to get your schoolwork done before you can play that new educational game we got for you&quot;, no more &quot;are we doing enough?  Are they being challenged enough?  Are they being too challenged?&quot;, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, let me say that I have amazing, wonderful kids.  We are very close.  I brought my daughter home after 1st grade and my son has never gone to &quot;regular&quot; school.  We have amazing opportunities here in Italy.  We&#39;ve been here just over a year and have just under 2 years left.  We&#39;ve been to Rome a couple of times, Vatican City, Pompeii, and have had the best pizza, wine, cheese, and bread on the whole planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, onto my questions.  I&#39;ve read a few times about &quot;arbitrary&quot; bed times, time on video games and/or other things and I&#39;m wondering what that means.  Do you mean just throwing a time out there with no thoughts?  My son has a bedtime of 10:00 and my daughter of 10:30.  On weekends they have an extra 1/2 an hour.  Granted, this is a hold-over from the schooling days, so it could possibly be changed.  We sometimes let our kids have what we call &quot;movie nights&quot; or we let them stay up as late as they want.  I don&#39;t understand what can be done at 3 a.m. that can&#39;t be done a 10 a.m., but I digress.  My son is always asking &quot;can we stay up late tonight?&quot; and I honestly get tired of that question.  Kids need their rest, so I don&#39;t want to let them stay up all night - where&#39;s the balance?<br/>\n<br/>\nVideo games.  I&#39;ve been reading the WoW thread with interest.  I do have to say that my viewpoint on video games has changed just since being on this list for a few days.  I was one of those moms that hated video games.  We have a 360, Wii, 2 DSs and 2 PSPs.  My kids were allowed to play only on the weekends and only if they got their schoolwork and chores done during the week.  However, after reading quite a few of these posts, I&#39;ve done a complete 180.  My son wants to be a video game designer and it&#39;s like a lightbulb went off when I read something about pursuing what they&#39;re passionate in and helping them develop the skills that they want to pursue.  I was almost like &quot;Duh!&quot; if he wants to do that for a living he needs to see how the various engines work, etc.  So now, hubby and I are trying to decide, again, where the balance is.  On the weekends, he literally plays from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed (unless we&#39;d like to watch something on tv - the tv in the living room is the only one with the game systems on it).  They also have iPods that they download various television shows on (Mythbusters, Mystery Diagnosis).  I&#39;m guessing that he probably plays so much on the weekends because that is the only time he gets to.  He has actually said that he wants to get in as much time as he can on the weekends because its (to him) such a short time.  So, we&#39;d like to give him more access, but how much?<br/>\n<br/>\nChores.  I&#39;ve only been on here a few days so I&#39;ve not read anything about chores.  I have some medical issues and some days I just can not do a lot.  Right now we have a chore list but after a while of doing the same chores they get bored.  I can understand.  They&#39;ve also come to realize that there are some things that they just don&#39;t like doing as far as chores go.  How do you handle chores?  A list?  Let them do what they want?  My dd - I hate to say it - but she is quite lazy and will walk over a pile of dirty clothes rather than put it in the hamper or, God forbid, throw it in the washing machine.  We told her a year or so back that we would not tell her how to keep her room.  If she chose to clean it, fine, if not, fine.  The only stipulation we put on that is she couldn&#39;t leave food/dishes (bugs) in the room and we&#39;d like her to pick up her laundry and put it in the laundry room because after a while it starts to smell.  Other than that we&#39;ve got various chores from folding a load of laundry to emptying the dishwasher, etc.  How do you handle chores?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am asking these questions seriously as I would like to know how to &quot;do this right&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n************************************<br/>\n&quot;Just as eating against one&#39;s will is injurious to health, so study without a liking for it spoils the memory, and it retains nothing it takes in.&quot; <br/>\n--Leonardo da Vinci <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38245,"nextTopicId":38242}}
