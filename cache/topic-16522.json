When I started I was in a similar situation because we started around Halloween and my son threw up as a result of eating candy whenever he wanted.  What I like about unschooling is that it takes the guilt out of it for me and empowers me to provides lots of choices for my children.  I find that they binge most on sweets when I have not put other options out for them.  Initially, I think they ate lots of sweets because they actually could without my input on when to stop.  But now when they eat a lot I don&#39;t say a word, I just get in the kitchen and start pulling out other foods that have little to no sugar and they will almost immediately switch to the food that I am putting out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe for most of us that at the beginning unschooling is more about the parent unschooling themselves.  We have to deprogram our definition of good parenting and replace it with a more intuitive apporach of dealing with our children.  My vote would be that you are not a bad mother, that it is not a bad thing that your children are cranky from eating to much candy.  My vote would be that you are a mother who is in learning mode and whose children are also figuring this freedom to be thing out, too.  I think what you have described is normal.  Children eat too much candy some days. That is no biggie to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you the best and am so very happy that you are on this beautiful journey to relating to your children in a way that allows both parent and child to truly be who they have come here to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch Love<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;April&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aprilsmapril@...\">aprilsmapril@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: 2006/08/16 Wed PM 05:12:12 CDT<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] New with a problem<br/>\n The problem started today -- they&#39;ve been<br/>\nasking for it ALOT -- and now they&#39;re super cranky.
