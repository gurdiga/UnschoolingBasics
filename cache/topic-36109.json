In this journey toward a more gentle unschooling lifestyle, I am sure I&#39;m not the only mom, gradually letting go of things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night someone addressed the fact that nighttime &quot;silence&quot; isn&#39;t really silence, in a much gentler voice (Tennessee night time sounds)  and it made me smile, the &quot;silence&quot; I was referencing did involve sounds of the night, an actual vacuum completely void of any noises would be unnerving, wouldn&#39;t it.

I&#39;m here to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was interesting that you took such an angry stance about inflicting opinions.   The idea of &quot;inflicting an opinion&quot; is pretty deep.  Forcing someone to (live by?  think?) your thoughts- would that be an accurate representation of your intended meaning?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a concept I hadn&#39;t thought of before.  My mom let us make a lot of stupid mistakes as we were growing up. I always resented that she never gave us advice or her opinions on any matter.  It&#39;s been a challenge in my parenting, because I think it&#39;s good to share our opinions, I would have loved to have known that my mother even cared.  The way she said &quot;do what you want&quot; always made me feel abandoned, as if she didn&#39;t care.  With my girls, I try to engage in a conversation when they want advice.  I ask several questions until it looks like they&#39;ve expressed all their thoughts and feelings, then I ask more questions, to make sure I am undersanding their perspectives.  I ask them how THEY would like to handle it, and Instead of giving advice, I hope to be teaching them that I do care, and helping them make decisions based upon their own thoughts and opinions.  I wonder, how do other people handle such a thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do care, but I wouldn&#39;t dream of forcing them to make social decisions based upon my feelings on the matter.  So I listen and if they can&#39;t think of a solution, I try to offer up a few different ways they can handle it, based upon their stated perspectives and we also discuss possible outcomes and ways the other people might react, and we try to hash out how SHE would like to handle it.  I try to bring them back to their desired outcome.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI get the feeling that some people here had parents who &quot;inflicted opinions&quot; and they&#39;re trying not to do that.  Does the same thing apply to teenage social and emotional issues?  What do you do to show kids that you care about their dilemma, and how do you help them try to find their own answers without &quot;abandoning&quot; them?  Are the endless conversations we have in my house typical?  My mother would have listened, and then not commented, not delved any deeper than our initial request, asked any questions or given any advice at all.  By the time I was 12, I had learned that I couldn&#39;t expect any kind of validation, advice or opinions from her and I stopped talking to her about everything.  I would have LOVED if she had ever even offered up her advice, and I can definitely say I&#39;ve never had it &quot;inflicted&quot; upon me.  She was horribly abused when she was a kid, and I think she always minimized our dilemmas because she really had it worse.  She also didn&#39;t<br/>\n trust her judgement, and I never knew that until I was an adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has nothing to do with the TV thing, I&#39;m thinking of teenage issues, it&#39;s just the use of the term &quot;inflicting opinion&quot; has inspired my mind to wander.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lisarussell.org\">http://www.lisarussell.org</a>   because .com and .net were taken<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: carnationsgalore &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:addled.homemaker@...\">addled.homemaker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, September 20, 2008 1:26:58 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: tv, video games, etc<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m interested in seeing the media debate here, since I obviously<br/>\n&gt; have several opposing opinions about the matter...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you want to debate about.  Your post seems really <br/>\nclear that you think tv is stupid.  You&#39;re certainly entitled to your <br/>\npersonal opinion.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very unschoolish to impose your <br/>\nopinions onto your children. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal opinion of tv?  It&#39;s just another thing in our day.  I <br/>\ngive it no more or less importance than anything else we do.  Yes, <br/>\nthere are some tv shows I don&#39;t care to watch.  Each of my family <br/>\nmembers has preferences for tv shows.  We also have preferences for <br/>\nbooks, comics, food, drinks, music, games, movies, playing, working, <br/>\nand any number of other topics!  I can&#39;t imagine withholding anything <br/>\nfrom my children simply because it is something I don&#39;t like.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For that reason, I have forbidden TVs in my kids rooms, I think<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s nearly a disorder to be unable to fall asleep in silence.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Forbidden?  Again, you&#39;re imposing your opinion and preference onto <br/>\nyour children.  I don&#39;t fall asleep to the tv, but neither do I like <br/>\nfalling asleep in absolute silence.  It&#39;s unnerving and is a major <br/>\nsource of discomfort and distraction.  I believe in each person being <br/>\nable to choose how to fall asleep and respecting those choices even <br/>\nif they aren&#39;t the same as mine.  The issue between your husband and <br/>\nyourself is simply another opportunity for people needing to learn to <br/>\ncompromise.  It sounds like you don&#39;t want your children to become <br/>\nused to falling asleep to the tv because in the future they may be <br/>\nmarried to someone who doesn&#39;t like falling asleep the same way?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say you value your quiet time as you fall asleep because it&#39;s a <br/>\ntime of reflection and peace for you.  But that doesn&#39;t mean you can <br/>\nget your children to feel the same way.  This is just another one of <br/>\nthose things that they&#39;ll grow up knowing is Mom&#39;s thing and then <br/>\nwill move out and do their own thing.  Why does it even have to be a <br/>\nthing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I realize that my value-ing of that quiet time doesn&#39;t make me any<br/>\n&gt; better or worse than him, and that my efforts to keep my kids from<br/>\n&gt; turning into &quot;sleeping TV addicts&quot; is one-sided and maybe his mom<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t create that, maybe she did- either way, it has nothing to<br/>\n&gt; do with my kids.  I don&#39;t love him any less for it. <br/>\n&gt; Lisa<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re not being honest with yourself.  Above, you said <br/>\nyou&#39;ve forbidden tvs in your children&#39;s rooms because of your <br/>\nperception that your DH is a tv addict.  If it has nothing to do with <br/>\nthe kids, why are you not giving them a chance to make their own <br/>\nchoices the way you&#39;ve been able to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my last thought is why you feel tv is an addiction.  What about <br/>\nother things that some people do a great deal of time because they <br/>\npersonally enjoy it?  Some people exercise hours a day.  Some people <br/>\nread hours a day.  Some people garden hours a day.  Some people watch <br/>\ntv hours a day.  Again, tv is just another thing to do in a day.  I <br/>\nhave seen this debate countless times and someone always posts web <br/>\nlinks to studies that tv watching is not as harmful as others <br/>\nbelieve.  I don&#39;t have those links but they&#39;re likely easy to find if <br/>\nyou care to look.  I personally think it&#39;s just another thing that <br/>\nsome parents like to control because they can.  I met a woman at a <br/>\nhomeschool park day who was very proud of herself for forbidding her <br/>\nchildren to read books in bed pretty much for the same reason you&#39;ve <br/>\nforbidden tv.  I suppose that&#39;s her thing.  I have an opinion of <br/>\nthat &quot;thing&quot; but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right of me to impose that <br/>\nopinion on her, you or anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36120,"nextTopicId":36122}}
