Maybe have a brainstorming <br/>\nsession with him and come up with a bunch of things he might like to <br/>\ntry or experience - even if its just a one-time sort of thing, like a <br/>\nMonty Python movie marathon, going to see a concert, driving around <br/>\njust to look at xmas lights, going ice fishing....

It can be hard to tell from a post why a parent is looking <br/>\nto &quot;expand&quot; something a kid is doing, though. Its so normal for <br/>\nparents to just throw things at kids if it doesn&#39;t seem (to the <br/>\nparents) like anything is going on - especially teens since they can <br/>\ngo through a period of some pretty intense internal re-organization <br/>\nand need a lot of time inside their own minds as a result. That can <br/>\nlook like daydreaming, but it can also look like revisiting old, <br/>\nsimpler activities - playing the same video games over and over or re-<br/>\nreading books from when they were younger, for example. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can also be expressed as boredom, which is something to watch for. <br/>\nIts possible your ds could be feeling bored for developmental <br/>\nreasons. Which certainly doesn&#39;t mean to disregard the feeling! <br/>\nRather to be concious that boredom can be internally derived - a kind <br/>\nof general feeling of being down, or dissatisified, or unsettled that <br/>\nisn&#39;t necessarily related to what&#39;s going on in the environment. Even <br/>\nunschooled teens can be moody. So in addition to tossing ideas his <br/>\nway, be sure to toss a little extra affection out there, too.

My first reaction when <br/>\nI read your post was &quot;get him a couple of introductory programming <br/>\nbooks and let him have at it&quot;  I know that when I was a kid and <br/>\nreally into computers, I would have loved it if someone had casually <br/>\nleft a few programming books on a table for me to find, especially if <br/>\nthe books included lessons that eventually led to the writing of a <br/>\nsimple computer game that I could actually play once I finished the <br/>\nbook.  There&#39;s all kinds of great books available for that, and not <br/>\nall just the boring textbook variety.  If he&#39;s truly serious about <br/>\ncomputers and gaming, I bet he&#39;d be totally interested in learning to <br/>\nwrite the programs for the games...................<br/>\n<br/>\nCat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Colleen&quot; &lt;cpaeff@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m looking for ideas that will help me to support my 13yo son&#39;s <br/>\n </span></blockquote>interest in computer and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; video games.
