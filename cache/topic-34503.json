I remember being able to take LONG walks with all of my sons and <br/>\nwe would talk for hours about everything and then all of a sudden <br/>\nthey stopped relating to me this way. I was so hurt and confused. <br/>\nSomeone told me that as your children grows so does the way we <br/>\ncommunicate with them. Such as when they are infants we coo at them, <br/>\ntoddles we redirect them and teach, preteens step out more on their <br/>\nown and we become their safety net and they know that the net is <br/>\ntheir. They accept this and want to know that we are their for them <br/>\nbut our input gets less and less.Teens do it all on their own and try <br/>\nto let go of the safety net and we as parents keep putting it back up <br/>\nfor protection. This is where alot of conflict comes in.<br/>\nMy husband and I have been through this. Our oldest son just got <br/>\nmarried and made us grandparents. But we are now dealing with twins <br/>\nage 14. After going through this with our oldest and him being our <br/>\nguinee pig, we seem to be doing ALOT better with the twins.<br/>\nWe did find that the way we reacted to issues that our children went <br/>\nthrough had a HUGE effect on how they opened up to us the next time <br/>\nanother issue came up. <br/>\nFor example when our oldest decided that he was curious about smoking <br/>\nbecause his uncle did it, my husband and I flew off the handle! We <br/>\nyelled, lectured, showed pictures of lung cancer, grounded him, and <br/>\nturned it into a week long issue. After that he basically tried to <br/>\nhid everything he was doing and this SCARED US TO DEATH! <br/>\nThere is just way to much out there in the world that young adults <br/>\nare open to expeiriment with and if they cant come to us as parents <br/>\nto talk with us about it because they are afraid of our reaction, <br/>\nthen they are in danger of jumping without a net. <br/>\nI hope this helps. And remember that your little girl is growing up <br/>\nand this is a confusing time so one day she may be happy and the next <br/>\nshe may be sad.

Puberty is about venturing into adult<br/>\nterritory.  So far she hasn&#39;t been legally responsible for anything because<br/>\nshe&#39;s hasn&#39;t reached majority yet, but she&#39;s thinking about it more the<br/>\ncloser she gets... maybe not consciously maybe sort of intuitively.  It&#39;s<br/>\ngradually coming closer to the forefront.  Was this a scary transition for<br/>\nyou (sounds like it was pretty sudden) and is some of the fear about this<br/>\nfleshing out into your relationship with your daughter?  Sometimes it&#39;s easy<br/>\nto move from empathy (understanding how a person actually feels in a<br/>\nsituation) to projection (seeing how *you* might feel in a situation and<br/>\ncrediting another with those same feelings).<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember being afraid of adulthood because my parents seemed to think of<br/>\ntheir responsibilities as burdensome and not usually much fun or even very<br/>\nlow key or easygoing.  They worried a lot.  I thought adulthood would just<br/>\nmean becoming a worrier like my parents and I didn&#39;t want that.  In that<br/>\nsense, I continue to idolize and celebrate childhood, which has had some<br/>\ndrawbacks for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how much your daughter wants a partnership and to what degree<br/>\nshe might prefer to sometimes depend on others.  There&#39;s a seesaw of<br/>\nindependence/dependence all along through childhood.  Being partners might<br/>\nbe more than she wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"&quot;Faith Void&quot; &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"what is &quot;normal&quot;?","postDate":"1215963634","msgId":34503,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDgwNzEzMDg0MHY0MjhmNGJkN2hmZDZjY2QzMDY4ZTA0MWE5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":34504,"prevInTime":34502,"nextInTime":34504,"topicId":34503,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am not even sure how to word this.

I really wanted to find a decent website<br/>\nthat offers some description of &quot;normal behavior&quot; for different ages. I know<br/>\nthat my kids are my kids and not normal or average but sometimes I fear that<br/>\nI might have expectations that exceed or not meet what is developmental for<br/>\nthem. This still doesn&#39;t sound right. I do listen to my own kids and let<br/>\nthem be the guide. I try to keep a partnering perspective and give them what<br/>\nthey need. I really feel like I need help with my 11 y/o. I was not parented<br/>\nwell (to say the least). I found that AP stuff helps until they are 6-7ish<br/>\nbut after that I have found mainstream ideas to become more and more kids vs<br/>\nadults. (unsure how else to word that). I want to allow my dd11 the space to<br/>\nbe herself but lately the messages I am getting from her are so mixed I am<br/>\nsuper confused and am having a difficult time meeting her needs effectively.<br/>\nShe has seemed happy but tells me (sometimes) that she has been unhappy for<br/>\nyears (she is a like dramatical) and others that I am the best mama in the<br/>\nworld, etc. Sometimes she hides things from me and other times she tells me<br/>\nand is very forth coming. By 11 I was emotional and almost phyisically on my<br/>\nown. I don&#39;t really have a gauge of what is developmental for this age.<br/>\nAnyway, I really want to be there for her and help her navigate the time. I<br/>\nhear that pueberty is very difficult and that hating your parents is normal.<br/>\nI don&#39;t thnk she hates me but she tries to sometimes.
