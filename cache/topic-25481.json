Sometimes the path is going downhill and<br/>\nwe all can go down as one group.  Sometimes someone trips and falls<br/>\nand we help them up... and sometimes someone is tired and grouchy and<br/>\nwe allow them some alone time to get their thoughts together so they<br/>\ncan carry on.  No one is here to carry the others, no one is here to<br/>\ntrip the others, no one is here to drag the others.  Sometimes there<br/>\nare people who have already been along this path and they can tell the<br/>\nothers things that worked to make their path easier the last time.  <br/>\nJust think if every single person on this list had the same exact<br/>\nviewpoint??   Boy that would sure be boring and we wouldn&#39;t be likely<br/>\nto get much out of having a discussion with people who think the exact<br/>\nsame things we do.

I know people are <br/>\nhere  <br/>\nto get *your* (collective your)  advice,&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nOK I really haven&#39;t had time to keep up on the posts on any list, LOL, but  <br/>\ndid have a minute this morning to read through the digest here and wanted to  <br/>\ncomment on this one.  <br/>\n <br/>\nPersonally I don&#39;t look at lists like this as &quot;advice columns&quot;.  I  think of <br/>\nit more as: we are all on this path, well some of us are at the  beginning <br/>\njust looking down the path trying to decide if it is the one we want  to take.  <br/>\nBut we are all somewhere on the path.  Maybe I have always  been living <br/>\nconsensually with my children so unschooling was just the logical  path when they <br/>\nbecame school age, so I might be a little further along the path  than others, <br/>\nand less so that some.  But I think of us all as equals, no  gurus.  All I can <br/>\ndo is share my journey, share what has worked for us, and  what hasn&#39;t (that <br/>\nhelps too).  I can talk about our journey but it is our  journey.  I may be able <br/>\nto suggest what I might have done if I were in a  particular situation, but <br/>\nwill never know for sure if I have never encountered  that.  I also may reach <br/>\nroadblocks.  It may be that someone who has  been unschooling longer than I <br/>\nwill take a step back and help me move that road  block, or it may be that <br/>\nsomeone who is new to all of this will run up ahead and  help me move it.  Or we all <br/>\nthree work together.  So I don&#39;t think  there is a &quot;collective you&quot; there is <br/>\nan &quot;us&quot;.  We can only throw down  pebbles along the road and some might find <br/>\nthem useful and pick them up, some  not.<br/>\n <br/>\nGiving advice seems like that are people here who know what others should  <br/>\ndo.  I can only speak for myself and what I have done or might do, not what  <br/>\nothers should do.  I agree that delivery is key, sharing is nice.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway just my thoughts on this busy morning, now back to work.<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25471,"nextTopicId":25496}}
