It&#39;s hard. It takes a lot of time. But it can be done to 30  <br/>\nkids at once. We assume that schools are using the best methods  <br/>\npossible for kids to learn. But they aren&#39;t.

It will look like she&#39;s  <br/>\ndoing no math at all. You will get very little feedback that she&#39;s  <br/>\nlearning.

We can see the learning. Or what we  <br/>\n*think* is learning. We see them spitting skills and facts back. But  <br/>\nis it retained? I sat through hours and hours of history in school  <br/>\nand I know the majority of what I know about history came from living  <br/>\nlife and following interests. My history knowledge looks very little  <br/>\nlike school knowledge. And yet it has served me quite well for what  <br/>\n*I* want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with schooling is that we get the idea that this  <br/>\nknowledge can&#39;t be learned outside of school. But if it doesn&#39;t exist  <br/>\noutside of school, then why do they need it! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe artificial way schools teach the information doesn&#39;t exist  <br/>\noutside of schools. But the information is there and kids use it and  <br/>\npick it up. It *doesn&#39;t* look like school learning. Unschoolers can&#39;t  <br/>\nsee it going in. We can&#39;t tests their knowledge. But occasionally the  <br/>\nkids do give us feedback that surprising things are going on! ;-)  <br/>\nThat&#39;s the frustrating thing about unschooling and one of the reasons  <br/>\nwhy the lists exist, for unschoolers to reassure others that kids do  <br/>\nlearn even when it doesn&#39;t look like school. They go onto college if  <br/>\nthey want, get jobs, become decent citizens. Even better they&#39;re  <br/>\ndecent responsible people -- even during the teen years :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My concerns are more with myself; how do I give-up the old ways of<br/>\n&gt; teaching that I have come to despise, old habits die hard!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a rare person that can just turn their back on schoolish ways  <br/>\nand embrace unschooling! That&#39;s the hard part for nearly everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, when we&#39;re in school, and their telling us that all these  <br/>\nhours of boring pointless work really is important, and we have no  <br/>\nchoice but to do it for the next 12 years, what options do we have?<br/>\n<br/>\nGive up? Some do. Some kids commit suicide.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebel and say &quot;You&#39;re full of it!&quot; Some do. They become angry  <br/>\n(because they see the truth!) and do whatever is in their power to  <br/>\nfight back. (And when adults do the same and fight for what they  <br/>\nthink is right we cheer! When kids do it, we call them delinquents  <br/>\nand drug them and put them in institutions because they refuse to see  <br/>\nthe world the &quot;right&quot; way.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd some buy into it. I mostly did (though I thought there had to be  <br/>\na better way.) They convince themselves that experts know better and  <br/>\njust do what they&#39;re told to do to get where they&#39;re told they want  <br/>\nto be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I wanted to<br/>\n&gt; teach her from a Christian world view<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are lists for Christian unschoolers. Not that you&#39;re not  <br/>\nwelcome here! But sometimes it can be hard to answer how unschooling  <br/>\nand Christianity can mesh. The Christian arguments for being the  <br/>\nimprinter of a child&#39;s knowledge can be so convincing, but there are  <br/>\nplenty of Christians who&#39;ve faced those questions and found answers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some links at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/world\">http://sandradodd.com/world</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOver on the right under Religious.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":340525938,"authorName":"ninastjohn","from":"&quot;ninastjohn&quot; &lt;ninastjohn@...&gt;","profile":"ninastjohn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"I hate homeschooling!","postDate":"1205639475","msgId":30956,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZyaTVmaitubWpoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30958,"prevInTime":30955,"nextInTime":30957,"topicId":30956,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m new here.

I hoped the subject might grab someones attention.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t like the word &#39;hate&#39; and very rarely use it, but after<br/>\nhomeschooling my two oldest children, ages 13 and 9, for the past 6<br/>\nyears, we have all become extremely frustrated with doing school at<br/>\nhome.  We feel caged, restricted, and even though we are enrolled with<br/>\nan online Christian school we are still subject to the Ministry and have<br/>\nto submit weekly emails, 3 yearly portfolios and tick off as many of the<br/>\n&#39;learning outcomes&#39; as possible.  HELP!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel we need to finish this year out with the online school as we have<br/>\nalready spent the resources money, but after June we would like to try<br/>\nsomething new.  My daughter (age 13) has a passion for reading and<br/>\nwriting but doesn&#39;t want to do algebra anymore... should I let her drop<br/>\nmath curriculum altogether?  My son (age 9) prefers hands on group<br/>\nactivities with his sister and me... should I drop the rigid curriculum<br/>\nand let him explore his passions?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy concerns are more with myself; how do I give-up the old ways of<br/>\nteaching that I have come to despise, old habits die hard!  How do I<br/>\ndeal with my own fears that my children won&#39;t get their high school<br/>\ndiplomas?  How will that affect their ability to get jobs in the future?<br/>\nAnd I just know that my parents will totally disapprove of me not<br/>\nteaching them in a formal manner, though I know I shouldn&#39;t care what<br/>\nothers think.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading this message back I sound like I&#39;m on the edge of a<br/>\nhomeschooling nervous breakdown.  I guess it really hit me 18 months ago<br/>\nwhen my littlest blessing, who&#39;s turning two next week, was only 6<br/>\nmonths old and my daughter stated, &quot;Mommy, if you homeschool Gabriel<br/>\nuntil he graduates then you&#39;ll be 54 years old!&quot;  My first thought was<br/>\n&#39;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&#39; followed closely by a strong feeling of dread.  Am<br/>\nI going to be stuck in homeschooling hell until all my good years are<br/>\ngone?  What about my time, my dreams, I want to explore my passions too,<br/>\nI felt like screaming!<br/>\n<br/>\nI took on homeschooling because at age 7 my then schooled daughter was a<br/>\nstranger to me.  She spent most of the day at school, would come home<br/>\nand go straight out to play with the neighbors kids, have dinner and<br/>\nshortly after go to bed.  I missed her, and also she was bored at<br/>\nschool.  There were other major contributing factors like I wanted to<br/>\nteach her from a Christian world view, her teacher complained repeatedly<br/>\nto me that Leah answered all the questions in class and that I&#39;d have to<br/>\ntell her to stop so other kids could have a turn at answering, and some<br/>\nschool safety issues.  Homeschooling was a decision we made as a family.<br/>\nI want to do what is right for my children but need a confidence boost.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan someone with unschooling experience tell me that everything is going<br/>\nto be okay and push me in the right direction?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30947,"nextTopicId":7156}}
