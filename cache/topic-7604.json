I hear 2 things.  She wants<br/>\ntime away from you and you want to support her and are ready for<br/>\ninvolvement.  Here&#39;s your daughter --new horizons, unschooling,<br/>\nstarting periods.  She&#39;s starting to realize more about making<br/>\ndecisions (not a school thought per se) and hasn&#39;t seen the<br/>\ncollaborative nature that decision making CAN have while still<br/>\nmaintaining a sense of autonomy you don&#39;t find in school.  For all<br/>\npractical purposes, the home has seemed to exist in order to support<br/>\nthe school system.  Home still seems that way during deschooling,<br/>\nhence-- as supportive as you are (a truly wonderful thing) --she wants<br/>\ntime alone from you to go on leg of HER journey and she will invite<br/>\nyou to join at points along the way because you will hopefully give<br/>\nher space she needs.  Otherwise, she&#39;ll feel you don&#39;t think she can<br/>\nbe trusted with autonomy; that growing up is too scary and maybe she<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t want to grow up.  But she will need your guidance and you<br/>\nwant to wear new ears so you can hear what she&#39;s asking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mentioned some new behaviors from your daughter that disturb you.<br/>\n How is that playing into it?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to suddenly swish school out of the scenario seems a bit<br/>\noverwhelming.  It&#39;s always been there,  seemingly a support system. <br/>\nThe ways we are dependent on that system are truly insidious.   You<br/>\nand your daughter have had a goodly dose of it.  It takes a lot of<br/>\nprocessing to feel like you said... free. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour aptly named deschooling dilemma post seems like the adage oft<br/>\nrepeated around here:  &quot;It isn&#39;t the unschooling, it&#39;s ____________<br/>\n(fill in the blank).  In my book, there ain&#39;t nuthin&#39; like hormones to<br/>\nmake unschooling a difficult transition.  :)  It&#39;s hard to be<br/>\ncomfortable with others in transition without also being in transition<br/>\nyourself, and it sounds like you have been going through several.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s to you!  <br/>\nKathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jlh44music&quot;<br/>\n&lt;jlh44music@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The one friend she has connection with right now lives 2 towns away <br/>\n&gt; (about 15-20 mins) and they talk on the phone every day.

Also, if she calls and <br/>\nDanielle doesn&#39;t want to talk to her (she&#39;ll see it on the caller ID <br/>\nand give me &quot;a look&quot; that says this!) I tell her, &quot;you don&#39;t have to <br/>\npick it up, that&#39;s what caller ID and answering machines are for&quot;.   <br/>\nShe&#39;s also told me sometimes she just doesn&#39;t like talking to her <br/>\n(because it&#39;s usually the friend doing all the talking, mostly silly <br/>\nstuff, which I remember having conversations about &quot;nothing much&quot; at <br/>\nthat age, but Danielle can only take so much of that).   I&#39;m going to <br/>\ncontact our local homeschool group to see if there are any teen <br/>\ngroups (other than the occ &quot;book discussion&quot; group that comes over <br/>\nthe email chain, she&#39;s not interested in that as she really doesn&#39;t <br/>\nenjoy reading for pleasure) or people we could try to meet (or at <br/>\nleast the moms first) as I don&#39;t know many people yet, we&#39;re too new <br/>\nand there haven&#39;t been many big events to meet others at yet (and <br/>\nmost have been all little kids, which didn&#39;t help as it made her feel <br/>\nlike it&#39;s only little kids who are homeschooling/unschooling, which <br/>\nof course we talked about!).   She enjoys people of all ages, and <br/>\nbeing an only child, has had a lot of contact with adults, and holds <br/>\nher own quite well.   I envision her having friends of all ages, but <br/>\nright now I think she needs more connection with kids around her age.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s playing World of Warcraft (online game) a lot and has &quot;friends&quot; <br/>\nshe&#39;s connected with there (she says she wishes sometimes they could <br/>\nall meet).  She doesn&#39;t do well in a LARGE group of people, but it <br/>\nwould be nice if she had a few friends she enjoyed doing different <br/>\nthings with from time to time.

I think it would do more damamge, but I understand her <br/>\nmissing certain parts, she said &quot;school wasn&#39;t all bad&quot;, she&#39;s <br/>\nremembering the positive things, which are all social connections, <br/>\nthe few that she did have, and just seeing the kids in the halls <br/>\netc.  But she&#39;s also forgotten how stressed and anxious it all made <br/>\nher to rush between classes (and this year they shortened the time <br/>\neven more) etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;......but it sounds like she&#39;s still trying to find herself.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I think she&#39;s just beginning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and also last night she shared that she thinks she may be showing <br/>\nsigns of getting her first period (showed me in the toilet, just a <br/>\nvery small amount of brown, which is a BIG change for her, she was <br/>\nalways so &quot;hush hush&quot; about it, embarrased, which I respected).   <br/>\nShe&#39;s really nervous about it (we&#39;ve been talking about it for <br/>\nmonths, and I even took her to her pedi and she talked to her (for <br/>\nreassurance) about what to expect, which helped), but she said &quot;maybe <br/>\nTHAT&#39;S part of why I feel &quot;isolated&quot;, it&#39;s hormonal!&quot;.   I also said <br/>\nmaybe that&#39;s why I got my period a week early (I&#39;m like CLOCKWORK <br/>\nusually!

She DOES do some things with me, <br/>\nbut she needs lots of time to prepare mentally for change.   She&#39;s <br/>\ncautious by nature, anxious, a worrier, not eager to jump into new <br/>\nthings.  She decided she wanted to quit karate this summer (she&#39;s a <br/>\npurple belt), we discussed it at length.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a musician.  She wants to explore guitar, but she says she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want lessons, she doesn&#39;t want my help.   She hates being the <br/>\ncenter of attention, she needs lots of time to observe before jumping <br/>\nin to new situations.  We were volunteering a couple of months ago <br/>\nhelping a man who fosters kittens, socializing them, but had to stop <br/>\nfor a while because they had an epidemic of distemper (we have a cat, <br/>\ncats over age 1 are generally immune, but he didn&#39;t want to risk it.  <br/>\nWe haven&#39;t been back yet.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yes, it&#39;s easier when you&#39;ve started out this way, I agree.

I said, do you think <br/>\nyou&#39;d like to be back in school (and I meant it as an honest <br/>\nquestion, NOT a guilt laden statement!) or involved in something <br/>\nwhere you go off to do something with other people or homeschoolers <br/>\netc that she&#39;s interested in, she said, NO, she doesn&#39;t want to be in <br/>\nschool, and as for getting involved in something else, we agreed to <br/>\nstart taking a look at what&#39;s out there.  I AM pursing my own <br/>\npassions, she sees me reading, crocheting, playing the piano, etc, <br/>\nbut she&#39;s not interested in any of them (and I don&#39;t expect her to if <br/>\nshe&#39;s not). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sometimes the damage that schooling does, creates human beings that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t know what their passions are.

What kind of books or comics or magazines does <br/>\nshe like? Seek them out. Music? Clothing? Time periods? Costumes?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMoney is tight since I quit working.   We can get by, but I was <br/>\nhoping to have more new piano students (there are very few teachers <br/>\nin town, but I&#39;ve been out of the loop, so people went elsewhere, I <br/>\nalso told the school music teachers I was accepting new students, <br/>\nthey&#39;re all friends of mine as I&#39;ve always volunteered to accompany <br/>\ntheir choral groups as needed, and parents often ask the school music <br/>\nteacher at the beginning of the school year if they know a piano <br/>\nteacher, but NOTHING) but only have one new one, and she&#39;s a <br/>\nhomeschooler.  We just built a house, she selected the color for her <br/>\nnew room and all the cool stuff to jazz it up.   She HATES to read.   <br/>\nI&#39;ve bought her some CDs of her favorite music, we&#39;ve listened <br/>\ntogether, I sit with her when she&#39;s on the computer, she tells me <br/>\nabout all the cool stuff she&#39;s doing (I&#39;m amazed at what she&#39;s doing <br/>\nwith it!).   She HAS been absorbed with the game.   We started making <br/>\na list before the end of the school year when we knew we would be <br/>\nhomeschooling, of things we like or want to do someday.  We&#39;ve looked <br/>\nat it from time to time, but no bites.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not worried about &quot;learning&quot; per se, I&#39;m more worried that she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want my participation in her life.  I read on this list and <br/>\nthe others about all the unschooly stuff and lives that people do and <br/>\nlive, sucking it in, but when I try to &quot;live&quot; it, she is shutting me <br/>\nout.   We&#39;ve talked about getting to bed earlier, SHE decided she <br/>\nneeds to get to sleep earlier than midnight or beyond, and wants my <br/>\nhelp because she can&#39;t &quot;turn it off&quot; by herself, but then sleep til <br/>\nnoon, and if I gently wake her earlier than when SHE wakes up on her <br/>\nown,(turning off the fan, she likes the white noise, then leaving the <br/>\nroom) she wakes up cranky.   Maybe we need some time to change the <br/>\nroutine, SHE wants to but isn&#39;t always pleased when I actually do <br/>\nit.   It takes her a long time to get going and wake up, which is <br/>\nfine.   But also to go off and do things (IF there are any outings <br/>\nplanned that she might be interested in for example, since she <br/>\nmentioned she wants to maybe be away from me more...), several of <br/>\nthem start before noon, and she&#39;d have to REALLY want to go and get <br/>\nup, and so far, the one&#39;s we&#39;ve considered, she decided she didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to bother.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I don&#39;t know at this point what to do.   (Plus it&#39;s that time of <br/>\nthe month, one week early, VERY unexpected, so I&#39;m sure part of this <br/>\napathy is from that, and perimenopause.....).   And the stress of <br/>\nthis past year has been catching up with us (last July 2004, we sold <br/>\nour house, moved in with my dad and were having a house built behind <br/>\nhim, which was delayed; the day after we sold our house, my BIL <br/>\ndropped dead, he was living with my MIL who has Alzheimers, we had to <br/>\ndeal with his death, (100 miles away), find an assisted living <br/>\nfacility and get on their waiting list, find someone to stay with her <br/>\nduring the week, go to the Cape every weekend to be with her (until <br/>\nOct 2004), then clean out her house (BIL and MIL stuff, she was a <br/>\nshopaholic), do repairs to the house, it&#39;s STILL on the market, we <br/>\nmoved her to a nursing home 2 weeks ago, cleaned out her apt, and <br/>\ndealing with Danielle&#39;s issues in school all of last year at the same <br/>\ntime, plus working in a very stressful situation).  It&#39;s been a long <br/>\nyear and I think I&#39;m overwhelmed, it&#39;s catching up with me.
