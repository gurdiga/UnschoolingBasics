HSLDA likes to have<br/>\nstatistics to back up homeschooling, because they are a political<br/>\ngroup NOT an activist group.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they don&#39;t always list the BEST options for unschoolers, which<br/>\ninclude umbrella schools. Or they simply mention it without any<br/>\ndetails. You&#39;re better off reading the law at a TX site and getting in<br/>\ntouch with local unschoolers for further clarification.<br/>\n<br/>\nTX is one of the easiest states for homeschooling. There is no reason<br/>\nto make your child wait....you have the right to withdraw him now. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32142,"nextTopicId":10742}}
