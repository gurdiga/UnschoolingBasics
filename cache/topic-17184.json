(actually just last week)  My <br/>\nkids were in school through 3rd and 4th grades.  We finally pulled <br/>\nthem out after countless problems with public schools, and within <br/>\ntheir school.  Now that we have been doing what is <br/>\ncalled &quot;deschooling&quot;  my kids are enjoying learning again, about the <br/>\nthings they like.  Last week we tried experimenting on different <br/>\nthings that might take the tarnish off from pennies-(something my <br/>\nson asked me if I knew how to do it/what would take it off).  We <br/>\nbrainstormed, and tried baking soda and water, peroxide, and even my <br/>\ndad had told me he heard that coke will disolve a penny, so we tried <br/>\nthat too. None of that worked. I was talking to a friend of mine, <br/>\nand she said taco sauce would do it.  So we tried soaking the penny <br/>\nin taco sauce for like 15 minutes, and it worked.  All of this came <br/>\nfrom my son, and his wanting to clean off the penny.  It was fun <br/>\nbrainstorming, and trying to figure out what worked.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know your situation with the public schools, but I can tell <br/>\nyou my kids were miserable.  They hated school, and didn&#39;t have fun <br/>\nlearning any more.  Some other things happened, which was the straw <br/>\nthat broke the camels back, so we pulled them out.  Now they have so <br/>\nmuch more freedoms, and they are getting excited about learning-<br/>\nabout the things they are interested in- not what is forced on them <br/>\nin the public school system.  Sorry if this sounds like I am soured <br/>\non public schools, we have been through alot in the past 4 and 5 <br/>\nyears.  I don&#39;t think schools promote exciting things to learn <br/>\nabout, and force the kids to learn about what they feel is <br/>\nnecessary.  I remember not liking school, and doing only what I had <br/>\nto do, to graduate and get out. I think it&#39;s important for me and my <br/>\nhusband to grow along with the kids, and learn together.  I think, <br/>\neven in the short times we&#39;ve been unschooling, I&#39;ve seen definate <br/>\nchanges, and luckily my hubby is with me every step of the way.  In <br/>\nfact when we first started researching homeschooling, neither one of <br/>\nus was sure about it, but now I wouldn&#39;t want it any other way.  I <br/>\nhope this helps some--sorry I&#39;m so long winded.  I&#39;m sure I will <br/>\nstumble, but there is always a way to get back up and try again.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, and the best advice I can give is to just enjoy, and live <br/>\nlife, and have fun.  Kids don&#39;t stay young for very long.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---Vanessa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;joanchris2000&quot; <br/>\n&lt;joanchris2006@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi, I just came across this idea of homeschooling/unschooling as I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; doing some research online to help me figure out what to do about <br/>\n </span></blockquote>my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3rd grader who just HATES School.

We eased our<br/>\nway into unschooling, but still only did basic stuff (mostly math and *some*<br/>\nvocabulary/grammar work) the first year.  After that we let go of curriculum<br/>\naltogether.  Take a vacation and let go of all the schooly things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your other daughter, you will hear on this list and on other<br/>\nunschooling forums that delays are calculated by a system that has no real<br/>\nbase.  A child who is unschooled will never be &quot;delayed.&quot;  There is nothing<br/>\nto be delayed from.  You might also hear people say that whatever it is that<br/>\nshe *needs* from school can also be given to her at home (and more!)  Is it<br/>\nfair to have one child in school and one not?  Sure, but only if the other<br/>\nchild *wants* to be in school.  If the other child is being sent and is<br/>\nunhappy or jealous about the freedoms of the child at home I would say that<br/>\nit isn&#39;t fair as you aren&#39;t really meeting the needs of everyone (and<br/>\nemotional needs are as (if not more) important than educational needs.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nMichelle Leifur Reid<br/>\nYOUR Pampered Chef Consultant<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nCheck out my homeschool cooking classes!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Just thinking about unschooling...daughter hates school","postDate":"1158259183","msgId":17189,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVlYzdsZitvNDY2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVlYmluaCthbTlyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17184,"nextInTopic":17191,"prevInTime":17188,"nextInTime":17190,"topicId":17184,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
