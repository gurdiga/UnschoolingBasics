I am a<br/>\nsingle mom homeschooling a single child and loving it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI made it through the first year!  Honestly, even though I had some<br/>\ntragedies in my life this year, we have absolutely loved our first year<br/>\nhsing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started out wanting to unschool, freaked out and changed my mind and<br/>\nnow; after the first &#39;year&#39; am going back to unschooling.  It was my<br/>\nfirst instinct and the more I read, the more I love.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still feel like I don&#39;t know what I am doing most of the time, but<br/>\nit&#39;s a more controlled &#39;out of control&#39; feeling. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to say hello and thank everyone for all the helpful<br/>\ninformation I have gleamed from this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nK/K<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschoolgirls.net\">http://homeschoolgirls.net</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschoolgirls.net/\">http://homeschoolgirls.net/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Not all who wander are lost&quot; -- J.R.R.
