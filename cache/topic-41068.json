We&#39;re staying at my mom&#39;s house for a few days and my sister and her family are living here at the moment. She has a six-year-old son, Carson, that idolizes my 13-year-old and wants to do everything he does--especially video games. Since my son introduced Carson to Spore, Carson wants to play all the time, but my sister doesn&#39;t want him playing video games for hours on end. So now we&#39;re staying in the same house for a few days and I&#39;m not sure about the best way to be sure everyone&#39;s needs are met (granted, we&#39;re talking more about my sister&#39;s needs than her son&#39;s here). She doesn&#39;t usually allow video games from 10-4 and after dinner. I allow my son to play as he pleases and it&#39;s one of the things that saves him from boredom when we&#39;re away from home. I hate to tell Jerry (my son) that he can&#39;t play. That doesn&#39;t seem fair to him. But<br/>\n&gt;  then it&#39;s not fair to my sister to make her life more difficult by introducing her son to things she&#39;d rather he didn&#39;t play, or by allowing Jerry to play when Carson can&#39;t. That seems like torture for poor Carson. Unfortunately Jerry doesn&#39;t have any friends in the area (anyone in Sacramento!?) so we do tend to spend most of our time hanging around the house--which means Jerry will be on his DS or playing computer games or the Wii for much of that time. I&#39;m not really sure how to meet Jerry&#39;s needs while respecting my sisters rules for her family.

It is hard for my sister and I as she doesn&#39;t get &quot;what asperger&#39;s syndrome is&quot;.  My sister&#39;s son is the same age as mine and her son is athletic and my son has always been clumsy so their interests are usually  very different. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn your case the age gap could be an appropriate way to handle the situation as you don&#39;t want the 13 year old resenting the 6 year old during the stay.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course many games on the Wii are very interactive and she may see how it can be both mentally and physically challenging- as a family we play bowling, tennis, etc....<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Colleen <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, August 16, 2009 1:35 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Honoring other people&#39;s video game limits<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;m wondering what suggestions any of you might have for honoring other people&#39;s video game limits when visiting family. We&#39;re staying at my mom&#39;s house for a few days and my sister and her family are living here at the moment. She has a six-year-old son, Carson, that idolizes my 13-year-old and wants to do everything he does--especially video games. Since my son introduced Carson to Spore, Carson wants to play all the time, but my sister doesn&#39;t want him playing video games for hours on end. So now we&#39;re staying in the same house for a few days and I&#39;m not sure about the best way to be sure everyone&#39;s needs are met (granted, we&#39;re talking more about my sister&#39;s needs than her son&#39;s here). She doesn&#39;t usually allow video games from 10-4 and after dinner. I allow my son to play as he pleases and it&#39;s one of the things that saves him from boredom when we&#39;re away from home. I hate to tell Jerry (my son) that he can&#39;t play. That doesn&#39;t seem fair to him. But then it&#39;s not fair to my sister to make her life more difficult by introducing her son to things she&#39;d rather he didn&#39;t play, or by allowing Jerry to play when Carson can&#39;t. That seems like torture for poor Carson. Unfortunately Jerry doesn&#39;t have any friends in the area (anyone in Sacramento!?) so we do tend to spend most of our time hanging around the house--which means Jerry will be on his DS or playing computer games or the Wii for much of that time. I&#39;m not really sure how to meet Jerry&#39;s needs while respecting my sisters rules for her family.
