I think that really helped Jody get a taste of what our typical day looks like so hopefully he won&#39;t be too shocked when he comes home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the only real obstacle we&#39;ll have to overcome is &quot;higher level&quot; math (why, oh why is it always math....), but we will worry about that if/when it becomes an issue.  Once Jody is here with us fulltime, he may come to realize it is no longer a concern of his. (That has been his only real hang-up with unschooling.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Our difficulties with transition hinged around housework. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think ours will probably revolve around bedtime, or rather lack thereof.  Not that Jody necessarily thinks that Tristan must be in bed by a certain time, but when he had a bedtime it afforded Jody and I time alone.  It&#39;s nice to have a conversation without a little one popping in every two seconds. ;o)  That is just something we will have to adjust to and talk to Tristan about...him having time alone with Dad and then us having time alone as adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nThankfully Jody is really laid back so things like definite meal times, TV restrictions, etc. shouldn&#39;t be issues.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And you might be surprised.
