She did. (Thank ypou very much Miss Opperman) and I printed the 20 charts and set down to see what might be <br/>\nissues&#39; for her to &#39;work&#39; with.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. ALL the children have the &#39;gate of sensitivity&#39; defined. Which means that ALL the children are highly senisitve to whatever - seams in socks, temperature changes, chemicals, food, or whatever. This is something that I found to be discussed often on this list already. How do we handle the need of my child to wear clothes that feel comfy. soft shoes, seamless tights/pants pj and more. This definition is not only &#39;generational&#39; - defined by a socalled generational planet (which is the way these definition come about) but also individually. So there. She has a class of 20 children who all are highly sensitive in one way or another.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. When I tried to group the children in &#39;pentas&#39;. (groups of five for ultimate energy) I had a difficult time. Since they are all within 18 months of birth date they don&#39;t show enough differenences in certain areas to join energetically to form groups of energetic compliance. This definitely speaks against the institutionalised setup of putting children of the same age group together. --- In our company I managed to get our management level into a &#39;penta&#39; and when we do meetings together the results speak for themselves. Teachers are really at a disadvantage here. Though my &#39;middle&#39; daughter told me recently that her son may be going to a school where the classes are combined - grades 1 to 4 in one classroom - the teacher may have a greater scope of combining energetic fits even with relativley small classes - even if they don&#39;t know about Human Design.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Within a family constellation - father, mother, kid(s) there is so much more differentiation within each persons energtic blueprint to provide &#39;electromagnetic&#39; connections which allow each person to learn and grow and experience in a &#39;natural&#39; manner what life is about. Just another &#39;reasons&#39; for me to know that institutionalised &#39;whatever&#39; does not provide the best environment for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlissings<br/>\nUlrike <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43321,"nextTopicId":43329}}
