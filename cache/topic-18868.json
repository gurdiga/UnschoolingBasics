Honestly, all the mind-<br/>\nblowing success is rather intimidating to me.  Is there anyone out<br/>\nthere that has unschooled to young adulthood that is successful and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t attend college?  Is there anyone out there with a more simple<br/>\nidea of success?  Is there anyone that defines success outside the<br/>\nparamaters of extended, institutional education?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to hear your ideas and experiences...<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron has been successful so many times before he even HIT college <br/>\nage. I think the best part of that was that he was able to see that he <br/>\ncould &quot;make it&quot; without the college degree. Magic, music, film, <br/>\nsports---he could make a living at any of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s always felt his weakness was school---school subjects like reading <br/>\nand math. He never felt like a success there, even though he was a <br/>\n*good* student. There were always *better* students who got the coveted <br/>\nAs. Then his crazy mom pulls him OUT of school---maybe she thought he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t *smart* enough for school? I think there was a lot of doubt <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nOddly, this is where he is right now. His weaknesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI reminded him that we don&#39;t focus on our weaknesses. That&#39;s what <br/>\n*schools* do. We celebrate strengths. I told him I didn&#39;t want him to <br/>\nworry about what he can&#39;t do, but celebrate what he can---delve further <br/>\ninto *those* things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, he&#39;s just written an article for Danielle&#39;s <br/>\n_Connections_ about Not Back To School Camp. It&#39;s the first thing&#39;s <br/>\nhe&#39;s written since leaving school. His big weakness has just proved NOT <br/>\nto be! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s started to write poetry. He&#39;s baking bread and cooking (salmon <br/>\nwith wild rice, green beans, and salad for supper last night. Mushroom <br/>\nsoup last week). He&#39;s looking at spending a week at The Farm ecovillage <br/>\nin the spring. He has a busy house/pet-sitting service. He wants to <br/>\ntravel across the US by car with a friend or two. He&#39;s filming a <br/>\nbehind-the-scenes documentary for some friends---starring Patti Duke. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe *is* looking at college, but not as the be-all, end-all. I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow that he will go full-time. Maybe just sit in on a few classes or <br/>\ntake a few hours here and there. We may go visit ASU in the next few <br/>\nweeks, just for kicks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe visits his girlfriend, friends, and cousin at college and is <br/>\nunimpressed with their attitudes and maturity levels. It&#39;s all about <br/>\ngetting drunk, staying up late, and belittling each other.  So it&#39;s not <br/>\n*that* he&#39;s looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s not *sure* what he wants to do right now, but I remind him he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to make that decision *NOW*. He has his life to make <br/>\ndecisions and change them. He&#39;s not sure he wants to drum for a living <br/>\nright now. That could change. He may dump it. He may go back to it. But <br/>\nit&#39;s consumed his life for years now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever his decision, it wasn&#39;t wasted time. He&#39;s made all SORTS of <br/>\nconnections these last few years---not only with drums, but with <br/>\nbaseball, skating, magic, music, and film. ALL of them are important <br/>\nand can (and already *have*) led to more connections and new ideas and <br/>\ninteresting people.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe feels a little in limbo right now---but I&#39;ve assured him that&#39;s not <br/>\nuncommon at this age! &lt;G&gt; He still doesn&#39;t know &quot;what he wants to be.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has SOOO many options and interests. He&#39;s open to new people and new <br/>\nplaces. He&#39;s *EAGER* to learn more. It&#39;s that eagerness that shows *me* <br/>\nhe&#39;ll be just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect he&#39;ll find his &quot;home&quot; in the arts---writing, sculpting, <br/>\ndrawing, music, film, magic, performance art---but it could be in <br/>\nopening a coffee house for musicians or organizing a camp for <br/>\nunschoolers! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe man loves life. He loves learning. He loves doing and being and <br/>\ntrying new things.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s just fine.

I don&#39;t define success as attending any ivy league college, or<br/>\nany college at all for that matter.  If my (very young) sons choose college,<br/>\nfine, if they don&#39;t, fine.  We already talk about all of the things they<br/>\ncould do w/out going to college.<br/>\nMy definition of success, one which I share with them often, is a feeling of<br/>\npeace about who you are, knowing who you are and what is important to you,<br/>\nand living life doing only the things that bring you utter bliss.<br/>\nI went to college, because that&#39;s what I was &#39;supposed&#39; to do.  Now, my<br/>\nteachers certificate sits there in a filing cabinet, with thousands of<br/>\ndollars of paid off student loans sitting behind it.  I always wish someone<br/>\nwould have shared other options with me; hey karen, have you thought about<br/>\ntraveling?  backpacking around the country/world?  peace corps?<br/>\nI would have made a different decision, I&#39;m almost certain of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nto quote the Cranberries (i think?)  &quot;The world is your oyster, babe, you<br/>\ncan do what you want to do!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thewildtribe.blogspot.com\">http://www.thewildtribe.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":278713983,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;zoocrew@...&gt;","profile":"tina010871","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Unschooling Success?","postDate":"1163424187","msgId":18868,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVqOXJqcit0YTRzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":18870,"prevInTime":18867,"nextInTime":18869,"topicId":18868,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can tell everyone from experience that un-schooling works.

The interesting thing is they found college level<br/>\nwork very simple!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above quote inspired my question.  It seems that when reading <br/>\nabout unschooling and how it&#39;s successful we often hear about these <br/>\namazing projects that are mastered by young unschoolers.  We hear <br/>\nabout admittance to top-notch colleges and universities and <br/>\ngraduating with honors.  We hear about all these impressive things <br/>\nthat seem to be the same goals of schooled and traditionally <br/>\nhomeschooled families.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am interested in a different perspective.  Honestly, all the mind-<br/>\nblowing success is rather intimidating to me.
