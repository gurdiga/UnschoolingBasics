Well we get there and she tells me we should get this paperdoll book because it can be for art. I explained to her that we could get it just because it is something she will enjoy. <br/>\n  then a few minutes later she says mom are you going to give me tons of homework when I get in thrid grade? I had to laugh and told her baby Im never going to give you homework. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  This might sound harsh but it makes me think of the slaves and how many became indentured servants because they had no idea how to go off and live on their own after being told when to eat, when to pee etc etc all their lives. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!
