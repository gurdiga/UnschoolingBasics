That might sound strange, but school breaks down family bonds and you may find you need to learn some new family social skills when school is out of the picture. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes some time for kids to decompress from school - its called &quot;deschooling&quot; - and while the basic rule of thumb is a month for each year of school, your milage will vary ;) Also, you can&#39;t really count the months of summer vacation into your expected &quot;deschooling&quot; time - until fall comes and your son knows he&#39;s Really not going back to school, emmotionally its just the usual summer break. During that deschooling time, your son may spend a lot of time daydreaming, or watching tv, or playing video games... whatever he tends to do to chill out. That&#39;s fine. Hang out with him as much as he wants you to, offer other fun things to do, but don&#39;t push.
