My co-parent is a major coffee addict<br/>\n(he&#39;s in computers and if anyone knows computer guys they are caffeine<br/>\njunkies).  I&#39;m a tea drinker myself.  Coffee is too strong and bitter to<br/>\nme.  Our children have been naturally curious about coffee and so we have<br/>\nalways let them try when they ask.  Most children also find coffee to strong<br/>\nand bitter (and hot).  Others don&#39;t.  Our children do know that coffee<br/>\ncontains caffeine and that caffeine can keep you awake when you don&#39;t want<br/>\nto be.  They know that there is decaffeinated coffee which has significantly<br/>\nless caffiene in it than regular coffee (or Dan&#39;s &quot;Deadman&#39;s Reach&quot; blend<br/>\nthat he likes so much)  Coffee is just another drink.  Just like colas.  I<br/>\nthink colas are much worse for children than coffee, especially with all the<br/>\nhigh fructose corn syrup and added flavorings and preservatives!   Why my<br/>\nchildren have learned is that while colas may taste good, they don&#39;t quench<br/>\na thirst, make you feel sluggish (and sometimes sluggish and jittery at the<br/>\nsame time) and are expensive.  They prefer to drink water.  Not because I<br/>\nhave told them that cola is bad but because they&#39;ve discovered that they<br/>\ndon&#39;t like the effect of colas on their bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider the message you send to your children about food.  If it is bad for<br/>\nthem it&#39;s bad for you as well.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Digest Number 848- intro/ concerns","postDate":"1145190124","msgId":12083,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDODJGNjc4MUFDMTE5MC0xRjU0LTlBRUBtYmxrLXI0Mi5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDE2MDAyNi43OTg0NDQxYzc2MDY0QHJseS15aDA2Lm14LmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":12072,"nextInTopic":12106,"prevInTime":12082,"nextInTime":12084,"topicId":12072,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
