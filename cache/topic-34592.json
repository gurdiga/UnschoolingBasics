I am  <br/>\nalmost finished reading &quot;Hold onto your kids&quot; by Gordon Neufeld, and I  <br/>\nconsider it a &quot;must read&quot; for all parents or caregivers of children of  <br/>\nall ages. The book is all about the idea that parenting is a  <br/>\nrelationship between parent and child. He focuses on on the importance  <br/>\nof nurturing the parent-child bond, and how that bond can be  <br/>\nthreatened by peers (because friends can&#39;t be expected to love  <br/>\nunconditionally, and attachments to them can replace the primary  <br/>\nparent-child attachment IF the primary attachment is insufficiently  <br/>\nstrong). He uses a number of examples including attachment issues he  <br/>\nhad with his own children. I found so much of what he says really  <br/>\nresonated with me regarding my own childhood as well as my children. I  <br/>\nmentioned Gordon Neufeld to a non-RU friend who is a family and  <br/>\nmarriage therapist. She recommended a couple of other authors that I  <br/>\nhave yet to rea; I am planning to borrow their books through my local  <br/>\npublic library. In case you are interested these authors are Daniel  <br/>\nHughes and Dan Seigel. The latter has a book called &quot;Parenting from  <br/>\nthe inside out&quot;. Hughes apparently includes tips to nurture the parent- <br/>\nchild attachment. My friend says she recommends the Seigel book to  <br/>\nclients.  I was introduced to Neufeld on another unschooling forum by  <br/>\nsomeone to whom I shall be eternally grateful.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nKimberlee<br/>\n<br/>\nHi my name is Natalie we live in Durham, NC.

When we went to the conference, I felt like I found my<br/>\n&gt; tribe which was a huge tribe.lol But then how do we tak that home. It<br/>\n&gt; has been a wonderful jounrey since, so many gifts, so much healing,<br/>\n&gt; so much joy. There are struggles but so much treasure we find when we<br/>\n&gt; come out of it.
