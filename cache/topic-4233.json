Regarding your question about how to &quot;teach&quot; her the fundamentals, let me assure you that unschooling works. You will soon see your dd&#39;s innate drive to learn and its strength. Trust it. She will learn everything that she needs to learn. You will be able to help her by answering her questions, showing her how to seek answers on her own. You will not ever need to introduce her to topics for which she hasn&#39;t expressed an interest. If you haven&#39;t devoured Sandra Dodd&#39;s site yet, I encourage you to do so, and I am sure many others will do the same. The beauty of unschooling is that you relax and trust that learning is inevitable. My own ds, always unschooled, is not yet three, and he is already entirely literate, reading well, nearly as fast as I do and including extremely long or<br/>\ndifficult words...he also has broad knowledge in diverse fields: I would go so far as to call him an expert on the Solar System, rocks and minerals, and mushrooms; and he is intimate w maps on all levels from the geological survey of our immediate area to the map of the world and can id most of the US states and over half of the countries of the world. He is computer literate as well. This is all from following his own interests and having his questions answered (from the time he could point at everything and only say &quot;Dis?&quot;), and I assure you I have never once sat him down and said &quot;Okay, son, let&#39;s learn about x now.&quot; My only part in this, aside from as I said, answering many questions, has been reading to him whenever he desired. I have also done some strewing; I purchased the Children&#39;s World Atlas after I noticed him studying a map in a waiting area, and have made other such purchases...he is always welcome to do what he likes with these materials (and he does choose to<br/>\nstudy them). But it is important for me to not value his reading the atlas, say, over playing on the computer, or watching TV, as there is tremendous value and learning opportunities in every aspect of life.<br/>\nJeff, I would like to advise you to not concern yourself much with your state laws at this point. I understand why you are concerned and interested, and I myself felt this way. But there are several years before your child is of compulsary school age, and in that time these standards needn&#39;t concern you at all (and then of course there are many years beyond that before she would be &quot;3rd grade&quot; age). The thing is, states&#39; laws change. Homeschooling is becoming more and more widespread and accepted and you may find that the laws in your state are totally different once your child reaches that age. You will be able to unschool your daughter wherever you live and you will be able to figure out the best way to deal w your state when that time comes. When I started researching states laws I didn&#39;t know that I would be living in a different state now (so all that research was really pointless). But, I did happen to research the laws of the state where I now reside, as it was<br/>\nbordering my own. At that time, in this state (MS), the laws stated that to homeschool your children you needed to be a certified tutor and submit all sorts of records and logs, etc. Now (less than 3 years later) this state has one of the most relaxed homeschooling laws and all a parent must do is send in a note once a year stating the children&#39;s names and that they will homeschool.<br/>\nAnyway, Jeff, enjoy your daughter and be amazed as you watch her learn every day of her life. You don&#39;t have to teach her; your job is to protect her freedom and allow the relaxed environment where learning comes easily.<br/>\nGood luck on your journey together!<br/>\nMillie<br/>\nby the riverside<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

It&#39;s all about <br/>\nproviding a rich environment, taking her the places you&#39;re all <br/>\ninterested in, meeting a variety of people, and all of you pursuing <br/>\nwhat you love.<br/>\nIn a home where parents are pursuing their interests, and inviting <br/>\ntheir children to join in whenever possible, enthusiasm and learning <br/>\nseem to bubble up quite naturally.

It&#39;s really <br/>\nweird to have a 2y.o. reading over your shoulder while you&#39;re on the <br/>\ncomputer, let me tell you!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, but the important point I wanted to make is that unschooling is <br/>\nnot result oriented. Millie&#39;s child reads at 2. I have a child that <br/>\nis really a beginning reader for all intents and purposes, at the <br/>\nage of 11. It&#39;s all good.<br/>\nWhether your child does things &quot;early&quot; or &quot;late&quot; according to the <br/>\nschool system, it doesn&#39;t matter to unschoolers. What matters is a <br/>\nlife of joy, pursuing that which we love.<br/>\nSome kids will do things that society worships (like reading) at <br/>\nvery young ages, others will not. What I love about these unschooled <br/>\nminds, is that they don&#39;t have to be labeled, graded or compared to <br/>\nother people. They can SHINE (Anne Ohman&#39;s term) for who they are, <br/>\nright now, today.<br/>\nWhat a beautiful gift.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you already realized this Jeff, but I just didn&#39;t want a <br/>\nnewbie thinking that kids will start reading at 2 or 3 just because <br/>\nthey&#39;re &quot;unschoolers&quot; (in reality, they&#39;re just being toddlers at <br/>\nthat age). It&#39;s about your precious child being who she is, and all <br/>\nof you discovering new things together.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 4 <br/>\nDate: Sun, 05 Dec 2004 23:58:11 -0000<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Tina&quot; <br/>\nSubject: How do you do it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I have a question that has partly to do with the unschooling <br/>\nway of life and partly to do with life management. Here goes...<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of you may already know some of these details. In the interest <br/>\nof understanding I am sharing for a clearer picture of where I am <br/>\ncoming from. Details...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seven children, five step and two biological. My oldest is <br/>\n18 and starting Dorsey Business school. She, as well as the five <br/>\nsteps, were/are public schooled. They all, minus one of the 17-year-<br/>\nold twins, live at home full time. Tabitha, Pat&#39;s oldest, is <br/>\nstarting Macomb in January. Tammi and Tracey are both at the local, <br/>\nyuck, high school. They graduate this school year. Amie and <br/>\nAndrew, Pat&#39;s two youngest, both attend at the local charter, also <br/>\nyuck but better, school. Adrian, my youngest, is unschooled. He <br/>\nhas been since January of this year. Before that he was school at <br/>\nhomed, and before that public school for 2.5 years, and before that <br/>\nschool at homed. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to be in business for ourselves. He closed the shop in the <br/>\ninterest of destressing and just pulling a check every week. Pat is <br/>\na transmission mechanic. It&#39;s not too promising where he is <br/>\nemployed right now. (He hasn&#39;t been paid in four weeks.) He&#39;s in <br/>\nthe process of opening our shop back up. This means long hours and <br/>\nvery late nights. Topping this off, my dad is dying of breast <br/>\ncancer. My step-sister and myself are sharing the responsibility of <br/>\ncaring for him, that is as long as she&#39;s not employed. She&#39;s <br/>\ncurrently looking for a job. This is taking up at least four days <br/>\nof my week. Relying on the teens is difficut, and caring for the <br/>\nyounger ones is demanding. Our unschooling life was already being <br/>\ninterrupted throughout the day in relation to the public school <br/>\nschedule. It&#39;s like adding a part-time job to an already very <br/>\ndemanding lifestlye.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdrian is 10 years old. He is what I believe to be a Highly <br/>\nSensitive Child. He would be considered introverted, but outspoken, <br/>\nby many. He spends the majority of his time playing PS2 and <br/>\nstrategy games on the PC. He enjoys Adult Swim and gross cartoons <br/>\non the PC. :) It&#39;s his desire to be a video game designer and <br/>\ncritic. He&#39;s definately a &quot;boy&quot; when it comes to the outdoors. He <br/>\nloves BB and pellet guns. His souvenir from Wisconsin was a new CO2 <br/>\ngun purchased with his own money. The highlight for him for the <br/>\ntrip was seeing a mother bear and her cub in my step-sister&#39;s <br/>\nyard/woods. His favorite place to be is my grandparent&#39;s farm, not <br/>\nour very tiny city lot at home. He really doesn&#39;t have any <br/>\nfriends. Also, something else that I try to not let bother me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy concern is this. I have a signifigant other that can&#39;t help me <br/>\nwith much of anything due to his personal schedule and life <br/>\ndemands. Getting the teens to help is work in itself. Most <br/>\nimportantly, to me, is my unschooled son. Should I be worried about <br/>\nthis? What have you done in this type of uncontrolable and <br/>\ntemporary situation? How did you make it through? What do you <br/>\nthink you would do, or how do you think you would handle it? Do I <br/>\nneed to just chill and not worry about it? I welcome all wisdom, <br/>\ntried or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a lot for reading this far...<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 5 <br/>\nDate: Sun, 5 Dec 2004 15:47:54 -0800<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; <br/>\nSubject: RE: Newbie with a relatively clean slate.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;wife Jane, who is 27 years old.

I was a &quot;B&quot; <br/>\nstudent all through school while rarely cracking a book, and NEVER <br/>\ndoing homework. All I worry about in this regard is her future vis-a-<br/>\nvis the rest of society. After all, homeschoolers/unschoolers do not <br/>\nlive in a vaccuum. Do we just &quot;pick&quot; a &quot;grade&quot; she is in based on <br/>\nher age? As to the government, I have no problem with fudging <br/>\ntheir &quot;required&quot; documentation. In my state, all they require is a <br/>\nyearly intent letter, and monthly attendence records. The rest is <br/>\nstuff we are required to do/keep on file at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy wife and I have a very active lifestyle, with numerous and widely <br/>\nvaried interests. I am positive that there is ample opportunity <br/>\ntherein for my daughter to learn and grow. She will have mountain of <br/>\nreading materials, and a computer, and video games if she likes <br/>\nthem. As to computer use, should I make a typing tutor program <br/>\navailable, our wait until she asks for one?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the in-laws, I have already planted the homeschooling seed. <br/>\nThey weren&#39;t really thrilled with the prospect, but seemed to <br/>\nunderstand my reasoning. The unschooling model.... ????<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the thick skin, I grew one long ago - I have never really <br/>\ncared what other people think of me. My wife, OTOH, is a people <br/>\npleaser and has real difficulty in defending herself and her <br/>\nchoices. Maybe she&#39;ll learn a new skill as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\nJeff<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ren Allen&quot; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If your goal is a healthy, happy, well-adjusted child, then grades <br/>\n&gt; and academic achievments don&#39;t really matter, do they?:)<br/>\n&gt; I think the best way to have a happy, well-adjusted child, is to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>let <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; them learn the things that interest them, just as you do (you&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; already figured out the forced variety doesn&#39;t work).

You are certainly on the ball <br/>\nwith your research. My dd was 5yo before I got into it.<br/>\nI did notice some comments from you that made me react. The above is <br/>\none, another one was on your wife not wanting to read much and your <br/>\nwife maybe learning that learning can be fun. My impression is from <br/>\nthese that you are dissatisfied with your wife&#39;s choices and way of <br/>\nbehaving in some circumstances.<br/>\nthe bit on unschooling that I have picked up seems to say that we <br/>\nshould learn to accept our children the way they are. To accept them <br/>\ncompletely also means accepting if they don&#39;t do the super things, the <br/>\nreading, the learning the way we&#39;d like them to, doesn&#39;t it? Now I&#39;m <br/>\nnot saying that I&#39;m neccesarily very good at these things (yet). But <br/>\nif we agree with this statement, should we not also extent the same <br/>\nacceptance and freedom to other people, e.g. your wife?<br/>\nI am the type of person that reads all the time and needs a lot of <br/>\nresearch and feed back until I settle comfortably on something. I tend <br/>\nto look into things deeply and mull over things and I waver for quite a <br/>\nwhile until I&#39;m settled. It is sometimes not so easy to &#39;defend one&#39;s <br/>\nchoices&#39; when oneself still feels new and raw at something. I often <br/>\nhave no problem with things in theory, but the practice and reality <br/>\noften give me more to chew. What I&#39;m trying to say is: maybe just <br/>\naccept that your wife is different. That it is not &#39;better&#39; to read <br/>\nlots, just that you are reading lots and your wife doesn&#39;t. You are <br/>\ndifferent that&#39;s all. You have strength and she has different <br/>\nstrengths.E.g. I read lots and my girl friend doesn&#39;t read and never <br/>\nhas, apart may be form the occasional cook book :-) She runs a <br/>\nsuccessful horse tracking business and is on the go from dawn to dusk. <br/>\nSo far she hasn&#39;t felt the need for extended reading and I have to <br/>\nadmit she is doing fine, having a lot of fun. Whereas I&#39;m trying to get <br/>\nmy head around my 14yo dd freedom to not help with house hold chores. <br/>\nNot so much fun so far :-)<br/>\nYou never know, your baby might take after your wife ???<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 12 <br/>\nDate: Mon, 6 Dec 2004 07:29:37 -0700<br/>\nFrom: Deb Lewis <br/>\n   <br/>\nSubject: Re: Newbie with a relatively clean slate.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Since she is so young, we&#39;d like to be <br/>\nable to &quot;get our ducks in a row&quot; before she is &quot;supposed&quot; to start <br/>\nschool, and to ensure that we don&#39;t make fatal errors in judgment <br/>\nthat will cause later problems.***<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything seems so urgent when you have a brand new baby. Your sense<br/>\nof responsibility is overwhelmed with the realization there is a life<br/>\ndepending on the decisions you make. I felt just like you when my son<br/>\nDylan was born. It seems like there isn&#39;t enough time to get everything<br/>\nright. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news is you do have time. The bad news is you won&#39;t get<br/>\neverything right. But even the bad news isn&#39;t all bad because in your<br/>\nmistakes you&#39;ll be learning something about yourself and your daughter<br/>\nand you&#39;ll do better the next time. So my first advice to you is to<br/>\nrelax and enjoy your new baby. <br/>\n<br/>\n***First, where does one start?***<br/>\n<br/>\nStart by assuming everything is all right. Trust your daughter as a<br/>\nhuman being will want to do what humans do. Be loving, generous with<br/>\nyour time, be willing to participate in her world. Accept that she is<br/>\nand will be her own person and doesn&#39;t need to be shaped or molded by you<br/>\nor society. <br/>\n<br/>\n***How do we &quot;teach&quot; the basic fundamentals? By that I mean,<br/>\nbeyond-bedtime-story reading, spelling, writing, and <br/>\nbasic arithmetic. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can &quot;teach&quot; them any way you want to but that doesn&#39;t mean she will<br/>\nlearn what you&#39;re teaching. If you want to know how to &quot;teach&quot; there<br/>\nare teaching resources galore. I hope you don&#39;t &quot;teach.&quot; I hope you let<br/>\nher learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to know how your daughter will learn, that&#39;s something she<br/>\nwill show you. She will learn to read by being read to, by having access<br/>\nto books and the freedom to explore. She&#39;ll learn by experimenting with<br/>\nwriting - she&#39;ll write jumbles of letters and be pleased about what she&#39;s<br/>\ndone. She&#39;ll pretend to read and be very satisfied. She&#39;ll start to<br/>\nrecognize letters and remember where she saw them before and when the<br/>\ntime is right for her it will all come together and she&#39;ll begin to read.<br/>\nIt might take a month or it might take twelve years. But because she<br/>\nlives with people who read, in a world where written language is<br/>\neverywhere, she&#39;ll learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll write when she has a reason to and she&#39;ll spell well or poorly<br/>\naccording to her nature. Enough people had trouble spelling well that we<br/>\nnow have spell check and other wondrous things to help us communicate<br/>\nbetter. (Like telephones! No spelling!)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll learn about math when she wants to buy toys, keep score in a game<br/>\nor divide cookies fairly among friends. If she finds math interesting<br/>\nshe&#39;ll look for ways to learn more about it. If she doesn&#39;t, maybe her<br/>\ntalents will be for other things. <br/>\n<br/>\n***My state requires a yearly written assessment of <br/>\nReading, Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies, and <br/>\nstandardized testing every three years starting at the end of third <br/>\ngrade. How does the unschooling model conform to these <br/>\nrequirements?***<br/>\n<br/>\nMy state doesn&#39;t require testing but if you can find other unschoolers in<br/>\nyour area and talk with them I&#39;m sure they have strategies.<br/>\nMy state doesn&#39;t require yearly assessments either but I could easily<br/>\nwrite about what Dylan has done. I have a huge calendar and because I<br/>\nhave a mind like a steel sieve, I write everything down. So my calendar<br/>\nhas the dates we went to the punkin&#39; chunkin, and the dog show and the<br/>\nsymphony. I have notations about hikes and fossil hunting expeditions and<br/>\nmuseum visits and art gallery tours and clay classes and martial arts<br/>\ntournaments, and ... Life won&#39;t let you down. You&#39;ll find your<br/>\nassessment material. <br/>\n<br/>\n***What do we say to Jane&#39;s parents when they pitch the inevitable fit?<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Bye!&quot; You can tell them you&#39;re considering homeschooling. You can<br/>\ntell them you&#39;re going to see how it goes. You can tell them Bree can go<br/>\nto school if she wants to. The less you talk to them about your<br/>\npersonal decisions the fewer fits they can pitch. She&#39;s not their child<br/>\nand it&#39;s not their place to make decisions about your family. You are<br/>\nnot required by law to let them fling the poo of negativity on you. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe said &quot;Dylan doesn&#39;t want to go to kindergarten.&quot; That was ok with the<br/>\nfamily members who were living near us because they could see he was<br/>\nhappy and bright and not missing anything. Compulsory school age is<br/>\nseven here, so they weren&#39;t in panic mode yet. When he was six we said<br/>\n&quot;He doesn&#39;t want to go to school.&quot; That was still ok with the closer<br/>\nrelatives because he wasn&#39;t compulsory school age. Family members who<br/>\nlived elsewhere started to get nervous though. At seven he didn&#39;t want<br/>\nto go to school so we finally said &quot;homeschool.&quot; Those who saw Dylan<br/>\neveryday were ok with it because they knew we were busy doing all kinds<br/>\nof things and most of them were smart enough to realize he&#39;d never be<br/>\ndoing those things if he was stuck at school. This was when I started<br/>\ngetting letters from concerned relatives who did not live near us. They<br/>\nstarted sending articles about education. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a hassle for awhile but as Dylan got older those who would compare<br/>\nhim with their schooled children found a kid who was smart, interested,<br/>\nthoughtful and engaged. Dylan himself became the reassurance they<br/>\nneeded. It will be that way with your daughter too. <br/>\n<br/>\n***If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process, <br/>\nhow do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic <br/>\nachievement?***<br/>\n<br/>\nPhilosophically grades don&#39;t matter, they mean nothing to a life long,<br/>\nnatural learner. I hope you can really think about this. A grade is a<br/>\njudgement about another persons learning and it has never and can never<br/>\nhelp anyone learn anything real. Grades (and tests) are dangerous and<br/>\nspirt crushing. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut since your state requires testing, and if you intend to comply with<br/>\nthe law, ask other unschoolers how they&#39;ve done it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome places let you pick the test and the test results don&#39;t matter. <br/>\nThey don&#39;t have any bearing, according to the law, on whether you can<br/>\ncontinue to keep her out of school. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people join umbrella schools that can help unschoolers with testing<br/>\nrequirements. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have read different things. Someone once said their child magically<br/>\n&quot;skipped&quot; those grades where testing was required. So for two years she<br/>\nwas in &quot;second grade&quot; and then she &quot;jumped ahead&quot; to fourth. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are opposed to the concept of testing in general you could move to<br/>\na state that doesn&#39;t require testing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 13 <br/>\nDate: Mon, 06 Dec 2004 15:27:03 -0000<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ren Allen&quot; <br/>\nSubject: Newbie with a relatively clean slate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Now I&#39;m<br/>\nnot saying that I&#39;m neccesarily very good at these things (yet). But<br/>\nif we agree with this statement, should we not also extent the same<br/>\nacceptance and freedom to other people, e.g. your wife?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree. As adults, we CHOSE to have children, they didn&#39;t choose <br/>\ntheir parents. If we want to provide a very nurturing, interesting <br/>\nenvironment, it certainly helps to look at the qualities in your <br/>\nmate that may hinder the process.<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t accepting where they are, it means there <br/>\nneeds to be some dialogue about how to avoid passing our own damage <br/>\nand hang ups on to our free children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had simply &quot;accepted&quot; my dh where he was, I wouldn&#39;t have the <br/>\nunschooling supportive partner I have today. I was unwilling to go <br/>\nalong with his ideas, I was NOT willing to just accept where he was <br/>\nand I let him know. Because I was unwilling to back down about how <br/>\nwe would treat the children (I told him he could continue to do the <br/>\ndamage, but I would NOT be party to it) things changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a level of acceptance as far as my not being able to <br/>\nchange him, his own changes had to happen in their own time. But I <br/>\ncertainly was not aiding and abetting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got the impression that Jeff is completely accepting of where his <br/>\nwife is, but also aware of the things that could be a problem in an <br/>\nunschooling household. His wife sounds like someone that was <br/>\nINCREDIBLY hurt by the school system and could benefit from all the <br/>\nhealing power of unschooling. I have NO doubt she will find many <br/>\nwounds healed through unschooling her own child, as many of us here <br/>\ndid.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think being aware of unschooling blockages or potential <br/>\nproblems means we don&#39;t accept our partners for who they are. It <br/>\ndoes mean you need to find ways to help that partner avoid passing <br/>\nthe wound on to their child.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 14 <br/>\nDate: Mon, 6 Dec 2004 07:33:12 -0800<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Krisula Moyer&quot; <br/>\nSubject: Newbie with a relatively clean slate.<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Jeff,<br/>\nI only have a second but couldn&#39;t resist commenting that I think you two are<br/>\noff to a great start. It seems like you both have the same goals for your<br/>\nfamily and your Type A personality can get the ball rolling with reading,<br/>\nresearch and asking questions but you&#39;ll probably find that your wife&#39;s more<br/>\nlaid back nature will prove out that as Bree grows and learns and *is* most<br/>\nthings really will &quot;take care of themselves&quot; as you said. My bit of advise<br/>\nis to read some unschooling websites and lists like this one. Let that lead<br/>\nyou to books that strike your fancy and also try to get to know some local<br/>\nfamilies who are doing it. There&#39;s nothing like relationships with other<br/>\nunschoolers. Our play group has families who&#39;s children are not &quot;school<br/>\nage&quot; and we don&#39;t think that&#39;s strange at all. Also attachment parenting<br/>\nresources may be helpful to you at this stage in your lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have years before you have to be concerned about your state&#39;s laws -<br/>\nreally. And by that time they very may well have changed. If it makes you<br/>\nfeel better you can look up what you need to know on www.nhen.org but I<br/>\ntruly wouldn&#39;t waste time on it now. Bree&#39;s babyhood will be over in the<br/>\nblink of an eye and I urge you not to waste a minute away from her on the<br/>\nlegalities of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAvoid declaring your unschooling status to people who might object (MIL, DS<br/>\netc.) after all, By the time they start asking about little Bree&#39;s schooling<br/>\nyears will have passed. Why have those arguments early?<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW My family took a detour from our AP, unscooly beginnings to send two of<br/>\nour children to a first rate Montessori school and we regret doing that a<br/>\nlot. It was way better in some respects than traditional school but still<br/>\nnot even close to as good as we have it now with all af them unschooled.

My name is Jeff. I am 37 years old, married 3 years to my <br/>\n&gt; wife Jane, who is 27 years old. We have a 2-week-old daughter <br/>\n </span></blockquote>named <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Bree. We are strongly considering home schooling/unschooling for <br/>\n&gt; many, widely varied, reasons. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Congrats, having a new baby is so exciting. It&#39;s nice to find <br/>\nunschooling at such an early time because you have plenty of time to <br/>\njust relax into it, read about it, etc.. The nicest thing about <br/>\nunschooling for us was that the excitement of watching all of our <br/>\nbabies&#39; earliest moments of learning - when they said their first <br/>\nwords and took their first steps - just continued and continued. As I <br/>\ntype this, I&#39;m listening to my 8 y.o. son pick out a Christmas carol <br/>\non the piano, something he&#39;s never been taught. The learning and <br/>\nexcitement just continue unabated if you let them. The best thing <br/>\nabout unschooling is that it&#39;s fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Several questions to you experienced unschoolers out there. First, <br/>\n&gt; where does one start? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here is a great place. Just reading about unschooling, both books by <br/>\nfolks like John Holt or experiences of real life unschoolers is a <br/>\ngreat way to immerse yourself and begin to let go of the schoolish <br/>\nnotions in your head.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do we &quot;teach&quot; the basic fundamentals? By <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that I mean, beyond-bedtime-story reading, spelling, writing, and <br/>\n&gt; basic arithmetic. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They will teach themselves this stuff when they&#39;re ready. A child in <br/>\na home where books are joyfully read will want to read, just as a <br/>\nbaby in a house where people speak will want to speak. A child in a <br/>\nhome where arithmetic is used, whether it be for cooking or <br/>\ncalculating the total on a shopping list or the angle for a new <br/>\ncabinet, will want to know how it all works. They&#39;ll pick it up in <br/>\ndrips and drabs and before you know it, they can do it. You&#39;ll see as <br/>\nyour daughter learns and grows that there&#39;s very rarely a moment when <br/>\nsomething is learned or not learned. It&#39;s all a continuum. A baby <br/>\nbabbles and learns to make noises with their mouth - are they <br/>\ntalking? Then they repeat a sound that they know makes a <br/>\nword &quot;mamamamamama&quot; - is this talking? One day they point to <br/>\nsomething and say a real word (my daughter&#39;s was &quot;duck!&quot; after which <br/>\nshe called all birds ducks :-) - but is this talking? They add more <br/>\nand more and more words to their vocabulary and one day they string 2 <br/>\nwords together &quot;me milk!&quot;. Eventually they talk in complete sentences <br/>\nbut with limited vocabulary, and at some point you realize that their <br/>\nvocabulary is the equivalent of an adults. At what point on this <br/>\ncontinuum are they actually &quot;talking&quot;? Every step along the way is a <br/>\npart of the learning, and all of it is exciting to watch and be a <br/>\npart of and encourage. Right now, my daughter is sounding out every <br/>\nword she sees, from cereal boxes to book covers. She&#39;s in that <br/>\nprocess with reading and it&#39;s exciting to watch too. Some day, before <br/>\nI know it, she&#39;ll be picking up books and reading them, and I won&#39;t <br/>\nexactly be able to put my finger on the moment that she &quot;learned to <br/>\nread&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My state requires a yearly written assessment of <br/>\n&gt; Reading, Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies, and <br/>\n&gt; standardized testing every three years starting at the end of third <br/>\n&gt; grade. How does the unschooling model conform to these <br/>\n&gt; requirements? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For us, it hasn&#39;t been a problem so far. Our son will do his 3rd <br/>\ngrade assessment next year and we&#39;re not worried about it. Though we <br/>\nhaven&#39;t sat down and done any kind of lessons, he can read, write, <br/>\nand do &#39;rithmatic, he&#39;s just picked it up along the way. I can&#39;t <br/>\nspeak to the yearly assessment as our state doesn&#39;t have that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What do we say to Jane&#39;s parents when they pitch the <br/>\n&gt; inevitable fit? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I wouldn&#39;t say anything for at least a few years. There&#39;s just <br/>\nnot much point if you know someone is going to be antagonistic about <br/>\nit. At 5 or 6 years, or even 7 (which is the compulsory attendance <br/>\nage in our state), you can just say that you&#39;re homeschooling. By <br/>\nthen, I&#39;m betting there will be even millions more homeschoolers than <br/>\nthere are now, and already it&#39;s not such an unusual thing. My mom (a <br/>\nformer educator) was fairly opposed at the first, but I always like <br/>\nto say &quot;the proof is in the pudding&quot;. Very few people, when they meet <br/>\nour interesting, engaging, and exuberant kids, could have any <br/>\nobjections to the way we&#39;re choose to unschool them. My parents <br/>\ndefinitely don&#39;t have any objections any more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process, <br/>\n&gt; how do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic <br/>\n&gt; achievement?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can choose to decide however it will benefit her the best. In our <br/>\ncase, we chose the latest grade that we could, because it would delay <br/>\nthe year that our kids will be tested. Our son is on the cusp between <br/>\ntwo school years, and we chose the earlier one (so right now, he&#39;s <br/>\nofficially in &quot;2nd grade&quot;). For a local homeschool resource center, <br/>\nwe might choose 3rd grade if he wants to get into a particular class <br/>\n(he&#39;s very into robotics right now, for instance, and the robotics <br/>\nclasses they offer are for older kids).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our goal is a healthy, happy, well-adjusted daughter, unlimited in <br/>\n&gt; her future prospects - while keeping Mom and Dad out of jail for <br/>\n&gt; failing to follow the rules. Any advice, resources, etc. that you <br/>\n&gt; folks can recommend would be gratefully received.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about jail. I know at least that in <br/>\nour state if you&#39;re out of compliance with the homeschool rules, they <br/>\nsend you a letter and you just have to get *in* compliance. I think <br/>\nthe worst thing that could happen would be that they would mandate <br/>\nyour child has to go to school. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve got many years before you have to worry about any of the legal <br/>\naspects - probably at least 6 or 7. Right now, I&#39;d just concentrate <br/>\non living in the moment, enjoying your daughter, and watching her <br/>\nlive and learn. Actually, that&#39;s great advice for the next couple of <br/>\ndecades!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 16 <br/>\nDate: Mon, 6 Dec 2004 09:16:43 -0700<br/>\nFrom: Deb Lewis <br/>\n   <br/>\nSubject: Re: Re: Newbie with a relatively clean slate<br/>\n<br/>\n***Grades and achievement don&#39;t really matter much to me.***<br/>\n<br/>\n***All I worry about in this regard is her future vis-a-vis the rest of<br/>\nsociety.*** <br/>\n<br/>\nYour daughter will be a better and happier person if she grows up to<br/>\nbelieve she is just as she should be. Comparisons hurt. People learn<br/>\nwhat they need to learn to live and be happy. What you need might not be<br/>\nwhat I need. What your daughter needs might not be what little Sally Sue<br/>\nneeds. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***After all, homeschoolers/unschoolers do not <br/>\nlive in a vaccuum. Do we just &quot;pick&quot; a &quot;grade&quot; she is in based on <br/>\nher age? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nGrades are a vacuum. They suck at you until you feel either superior to<br/>\nothers or desperately inadequate. They suck at parents until they change<br/>\nthe way a parent sees a child, either as full of potential (which is<br/>\nunfair and creates pressure) or as lacking, in need of repair. Please<br/>\ndon&#39;t do this to your daughter. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has the chance to grow up never being judged as &quot;ahead&quot; or &quot;behind&quot;. <br/>\nShe can be a person living her life without the emotional stress of<br/>\narbitrary assessments from others. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since unschoolers don&#39;t live in a vacuum she will have a much more<br/>\nfun filled and interesting life than the tested and graded 8:00 AM to<br/>\n3:00 PM schooled kids who have two hours of homework every night. How do<br/>\nyou grade another person&#39;s life? What right do you have to even want<br/>\nto? <br/>\n<br/>\n***My wife, OTOH, is a people pleaser and has real difficulty in<br/>\ndefending herself and her <br/>\nchoices. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be hard. When people make judgements about the most important<br/>\nthings in our lives, it hurts. If her family gives her a D minus in<br/>\nparenting how will you comfort her? <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 17 <br/>\nDate: Mon, 6 Dec 2004 09:56:28 -0700<br/>\nFrom: Deb Lewis <br/>\n   <br/>\nSubject: Re: How do you do it?<br/>\n<br/>\n***Most importantly, to me, is my unschooled son. Should I be worried<br/>\nabout <br/>\nthis? What have you done in this type of uncontrolable and <br/>\ntemporary situation?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry about your dad. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad died of bone cancer four years ago when my son Dylan was eight. <br/>\nWe took care of him at home. It&#39;s such an emotionally exhausting time. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake comfort that your son loves video games and enjoys his time playing.<br/>\nIt is so wonderful that he has something to do when you can&#39;t be right<br/>\nthere with him. <br/>\n<br/>\nTalk to him. Make sure he knows things will be different - you *will*<br/>\nhave more time one day. As you said this is a temporary situation. <br/>\nMaybe even make plans for a special trip. Let both of you have something<br/>\npositive to focus on. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have a few free hours do something different. Take him out to<br/>\nlunch. Go to the park and throw a Frisbee around. Wander around the<br/>\nbook store, test drive Jeeps, go to the shooting range. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour life and your son&#39;s life will move forward from this point, even<br/>\nthough it doesn&#39;t feel that way now. Things will be ok. But make every<br/>\neffort to make the time you do spend with your son as positive as it can<br/>\nbe. Even if you&#39;re just sitting beside him while he plays a game.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Getting the teens to help is work in itself. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp like, around the house? Could you hire a neighborhood teen or<br/>\nsomeone to come in and help out? I know it would be an expense but now<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re so stressed and worn out it would be a much more peaceful and<br/>\neffective solution than trying to get people to help who don&#39;t really<br/>\nwant to. You really don&#39;t need the added stress of a domestic power<br/>\nstruggle. Do what you can to avoid that. Is there a homeschooler you<br/>\nknow who would tidy up for you in exchange for something? <br/>\n<br/>\nAsk more from your partner. These are special circumstances and he *can*<br/>\ngive a little more, temporarily. Wouldn&#39;t you be willing to do the same<br/>\nfor him? Let him know what you need. My own husband felt really lost<br/>\nwhen we were taking care of my dad. He really didn&#39;t know what would<br/>\nhelp me the most. It helped him (and me!) a lot when I just told him<br/>\nwhat I wanted him to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember some of household stuff probably isn&#39;t as important to your<br/>\nfamily members as it is to you. Talk to them about it, I&#39;ll bet they<br/>\nreally don&#39;t care if dishes sit a few days. Let them sit if you can&#39;t<br/>\nget to them. Maybe even switch to paper plates and plastic disposable<br/>\nbowls and plastic utensils. Do whatever it takes to make your load<br/>\nlighter. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll keep thinking. Write me off list if you want. I&#39;m so sorry for<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re going through, but it will change. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
