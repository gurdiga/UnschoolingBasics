My suggestions were to only smoke <br/>\nGOOD <br/>\n&gt; stuff---to know where it came from---no &quot;I bought it on the street <br/>\n&gt; corner&quot; stuff. Never buy from strangers. Never smoke out in the <br/>\nopen. <br/>\n&gt; Never smoke IN my house! Never smoke on front of his little <br/>\nbrother. BE <br/>\n&gt; SMART about it.
