He&#39;s understood the concept of multiplication for <br/>\nsomewhere around 2 years - because he saw us use it. And, when he was <br/>\ndoing something with multiple &#39;piles&#39; of something (like stacks of <br/>\npennies), he knew to ask &quot;what&#39;s 10 times 6?&quot;. Sometimes in the car <br/>\nhe&#39;d say &quot;Mommy, what&#39;s 6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6 equal?&quot; I had to be alert so <br/>\nI could keep track of how many sizes (or whatever) he said - then I&#39;d <br/>\nsay &quot;that was nine sixes so that&#39;s nine times six, that&#39;s 54&quot;. Within <br/>\nthe last month roughly he&#39;s been more interested in the details, <br/>\nasking lots more of the &quot;what does...equal?&quot; questions. So, I sketched <br/>\nthe basic &quot;multiplication table&quot; (1-10) and an &quot;addition table&quot; (1-10) <br/>\non our kitchen chalkboard (it&#39;s 4&#39;x8&#39;). Now they&#39;re there for him if <br/>\nhe wants to check something (didn&#39;t have enough room to go higher than <br/>\n10, lots of other stuff floating around the chalkboard). He&#39;s also <br/>\nnoticing things like 10 PLUS 10 is 20 but 10 TIMES 10 is 100 and that <br/>\n10 PLUS 10 is the same as 10 TIMES 2. All his own discoveries. Which <br/>\ndo think would stay with him better - something that connects deeply <br/>\nbecause he &#39;owns&#39; the idea or information or something I forced on him <br/>\nbecause he was 7 and that&#39;s what 7 yr olds are &#39;supposed&#39; to do? Once <br/>\nthe concept is there, the data can be added easily as needed. And <br/>\nthere&#39;s the key - *as needed* with need being defined not solely in <br/>\nutility terms but also including the aspect of personal satisfaction <br/>\n(like when you can&#39;t remember the name of that actor, you know, that <br/>\none who was in... so you go look it up because you &quot;need&quot; to find out <br/>\nfor your own satisfaction). Right now, DS &quot;needs&quot; to explore numbers, <br/>\njust as he explored letters, sounds, words and grew into reading <br/>\norganically, as a part of himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92643757,"authorName":"Leslie530@aol.com","from":"Leslie530@...","profile":"lescather","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"math skills, was shifting paradigm","postDate":"1127955217","msgId":6906,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwZS5hNWY0YTAwLjMwNmM5NTExQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6911,"prevInTime":6905,"nextInTime":6907,"topicId":6906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/28/2005 8:29:56 P.M.

It is a job that uses plenty of math.  I worked at several  different <br/>\ncompanies and one of the first things I received at each new job  was the <br/>\nmath cheat sheet!  It would have all the common formulas we would  encounter and <br/>\nexactly what to do with them.  Sometimes the formulas varied  from company to <br/>\ncompany.<br/>\n <br/>\nThey gave me a cheat sheet because they wanted everyone doing the same  <br/>\nthing....quickly.... and they knew that just because we had 12+ years of  math <br/>\ndidn&#39;t mean that we could estimate how many rolls of wall paper to order  for a <br/>\nmillion dollar hotel installation.  Nobody at the company cared what  my math <br/>\nskills were (that I *could* figure that out without a cheat sheet), just  that I <br/>\ncould do my job quickly and correctly.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and after using them often enough, I didn&#39;t have to use my cheat  sheet.  <br/>\nThere were several fractions I came across so often that I didn&#39;t  have to <br/>\nlook them up or calculate them.  I was measuring something at home  recently and <br/>\nfound that I know longer knew automatically what 7/16ths plus  7/32ths was.  <br/>\nI can figure it out, but it isn&#39;t as natural as two plus two  anymore.  It <br/>\njust isn&#39;t relevant anymore, but if it became relevant I would  either learn the <br/>\nanswer or make a new cheat sheet.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6904,"nextTopicId":6899}}
