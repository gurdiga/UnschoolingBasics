It sounds like you support not forcing sharing but you would like to find a better social experience for your son. And, by better I mean one that meets his needs for interaction. If your son is passionate about meeting up with this friend despite his desire to play alone then by all means facilitate the meet ups. <br/>\n<br/>\nExplaining different personalities is good advice. But, if you&#39;ve tried this a few times and it&#39;s not fun for you or your son then why keep putting yourself through it? <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the way you describe this mom it sounds like she or your son may not be a good fit - ar least right now. If she is regularly off in the kitchen leaving you to supervise the kids then it doesn&#39;t sound like a great day for you. And, if your son wants to play then maybe you need to find playmates - older, younger, same age - that want to play. If that is his need why not try to meet that need even while you explain that you can&#39;t in that exact moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience has been that we have few families in our lives none of which are unschooled. We live in a large city centre where most mothers return to work after one year. Since we socialise with mainstream families we do see some differences in the way we do things but we have been lucky enough to find friendly families who seem to live and let live. My daughter has one friend in particular that she is quite attached to. I like the girl but I&#39;m not thrilled with the way they interact. The friend likes to &#39;control&#39; my daughter who often likes to play the role of follower until she doesn&#39;t and then there is conflict which can be quite violent with the friend who is a biter and goes for the eyes. Knowing this I stay close so I can intervene before conflict starts. My daughter has expressed great joy when we see this friend so I have faciliated their friendship. Though she now appears to be outgrowing the friend. My point is that while there may be conflict there may be something you son wants / needs to work out or explore socially. If not find a relationship that he does want to explore. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can take a long time to find that holy grail of kids who want to connect and moms who do too. I liken it to a kind of dating. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck finding a good social fit for you and your son, <br/>\n<br/>\nAll best, <br/>\n<br/>\nTamara<br/>\nmom to Ella (3 yrs) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;t_guyonvarch&quot; &lt;titiskarweni@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son, now 4.5, has always been happy to share his things from early age, even though I never asked him to at the time, but because both me and my husband always play with him so he sees that it&#39;s more fun to play with someone as stories can be more interestingly made up.

Independent<br/>\nof age. For my youngest granddaughter this means that she IS a boowa and kwala player (at<br/>\nthis time). When she comes to our place she does not so to meet me or anyone else but to<br/>\nplay boowa and kwala. And anything not complying with this expectation is just not<br/>\nacceptable for her. It also means that there is no way for her to &#39;share&#39; playing. Basta,<br/>\nuntil she is played out for the day and someone else can get a chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll other &#39;players&#39; are not real for her in that time frame. They just don&#39;t count.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you got guests and they had expectations (of which you were not aware) of being the <br/>\n<br/>\nbig player - very personal and nothing to do with being guests at your place of course. As<br/>\nI see it we, as separate entities have no influence or control, bless our souls.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)       the rules how things should play out are very very unclear and very very fuzzy<br/>\nbetween very young players. Fair is a foreign concept and fair is not what we want it to<br/>\nbe even when we are 50 years old old or older. Expectations, especially unvoiced<br/>\nexpectations are the key to suffering major pain. Remember that getting your own child to<br/>\nplay &#39;fair&#39; with his/her siblings is difficult. To induce a &#39;stranger&#39; to the rules of<br/>\nyour home is near impossible I would think.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)       What are your expectations when you ask a mother with her children to visit?<br/>\n(This is not to keep you from doing do, just to become clear on realities :-) ) She should<br/>\nhave control over her children knowing mine and thine and who is to be in control of<br/>\nthine? Well you go to a meet with your chuld and they &#39;take over&#39; how do you lead your<br/>\nchild from &#39;I am the conqueror&#39; to accepting second best? I really don&#39;t want to push a<br/>\nnoodle here. Please. I never went to any other place with my child to let it feel the<br/>\ndisempowerment of not being in control of the things that were available.  When you ask<br/>\nothers with children over - I think it would be absolutely respectful of the other<br/>\nchildren to make available whatever it is that you (and your child) feel happy with that<br/>\nthe others can control/handle/have dominion over while they are there and keep EVERYTHING<br/>\nelse out of their reach. I don&#39;t let others into MY kitchen! I don&#39;t let others into my<br/>\nkitchen, even to do the dishes after a big meal. So why let other kids into the toys of<br/>\nyour children. When I allow others to visit me I have certain boundaries. We talk about X,<br/>\nwe share Y, we do Z but they don&#39;t take over my realm. And they don&#39;t take over my<br/>\nchildren&#39;s (grandchildren&#39;s) realm. When they try I tell them NO but thank you no and go<br/>\nhome. <br/>\n<br/>\n4)       I can share and I share frequently. But I also experience a lot of &#39;being taken<br/>\nfor a ride&#39; when I don&#39;t listen to my inner &#39;keep away from that&#39; voice. I want my<br/>\nchildren and grandchildren to be able to listen and act on this inner voice before it<br/>\ncosts them as much as is has cost me to date. -There are times when my inner voice says,<br/>\n&quot;Go ahead, give and share.&quot; And it is ok. But the other times are still smarting, even<br/>\nyears later.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want you to hear that I am saying that you are wrong in any way in inviting people<br/>\nover. Invite them any way. Just know that not all visitors have your and your children&#39;s<br/>\nbest interest at heart when they come. Some really want to further their own interest.<br/>\nWhich is ok, for them, but not necessarily for you and yours. If a mother wants to connect<br/>\nwith you and your child because she feels that this is what her child needs and she is so<br/>\nhappy to be with you and wants to share with your interest, then by all means, try a<br/>\nvisit, I would say.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think not havingt a bad experience and being bored is less detrimental than having a bad<br/>\nexperience just for wanting to get out of bored. But I could be wrong. Maybe we need a<br/>\ncouple of &#39;bad&#39; experiences&#39; to know what we don&#39;t want before we can stop having bad<br/>\nexperiences.

I have no say there any more :-) She<br/>\nwill defend this right with everything she has. Taking this from her takes away her<br/>\n&#39;honor&#39;. It breaks my heart, too. (playing B&K is her single most potent reason for being<br/>\nwho she is at this time. It gives her total control over a certain part in her world -<br/>\nempowerment! Ability, capability. Standing up for this empowerment is absolute priority<br/>\nfor her now.) Maybe in a year or two she will come and visit me for the stories we read<br/>\nout of books or the games we play.

Sometime around this, I notice that now my son often doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\nshare (especially when he&#39;s tired) and worse, he also shouted to express this, copying<br/>\nthese two other kids.

It is certainly not nice being at the receiving end of the result of unschooling<br/>\napproach. I now understand better about unschooling, though may not be all of it yet, so I<br/>\nunderstand this mum&#39;s stand and appreciate that. However, until her son learn to share, I<br/>\nwill not meet up with her anymore, or only very rarely and also outdoor so it&#39;s easier to<br/>\nget my son away from this kid. It&#39;s also true that other kids can influence my kid&#39;s<br/>\nbehaviour in a not so nice way, even though the family is also doing unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, it is good not to push our opinion on our kids but it is also ok to explain<br/>\nsometimes what could be a nice thing to do. If they decided not to do it, then so be it.<br/>\nIn the case of this kid, he may never see the consequence of his action as he would never<br/>\nknow why we never invite him to our place anymore. An opportunity of building friendship<br/>\nis lost, though his mum said once that he now seems to look for relationship with other<br/>\nkids.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, we have never been invited to their place, and from what I gather, they also<br/>\nrarely invite others, so this kid doesn&#39;t have a lot of opportunity to learn that it could<br/>\nbe nice to share his things, other than with his younger sibling. Not that I feel the need<br/>\nto go to their place (though my son used to ask to go to their place), but when sharing is<br/>\nonly one way, it gets tiring after a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________ Information from ESET NOD32 Antivirus, version of virus signature database 5410<br/>\n(20100830) __________<br/>\n<br/>\nThe message was checked by ESET NOD32 Antivirus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eset.com\">http://www.eset.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________ Information from ESET NOD32 Antivirus, version of virus signature database 5410<br/>\n(20100830) __________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe message was checked by ESET NOD32 Antivirus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eset.com\">http://www.eset.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n__________ Information from ESET NOD32 Antivirus, version of virus signature database 5410<br/>\n(20100830) __________<br/>\n<br/>\nThe message was checked by ESET NOD32 Antivirus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eset.com\">http://www.eset.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Sociability","postDate":"1283196165","msgId":44716,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk1aDBlNSsyYmg0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk1Z2RyZStva2JxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44715,"nextInTopic":44717,"prevInTime":44715,"nextInTime":44717,"topicId":44628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *************** This is something that s alllllllll about personality, not parenting, at all.

It sounds like the mom needed the &quot;play date&quot; more than her kid - that&#39;s not uncommon with moms of little kids, even among unschoolers. Sometimes moms go a little stir crazy and need to get out. That&#39;s not about unschooling or homeschooling, its about human nature. Unschooling doesn&#39;t make someone automatically a perfect parent ;) We have our bad days and lapses of judgement, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere will likely be other times when your son is the more outgoing of playmates. If his feelings tend to be easily hurt, it can help to talk about differences - we did that with Ray when he was little and soooooo social. He didn&#39;t understand why other people didn&#39;t want to play and socialize with him - and it wasn&#39;t about him, it was about personality. He wasn&#39;t sure he Believed that some people were more private and liked to be alone, but he was willing to accept that as a possiblility anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; In my opinion, it is good not to push our opinion on our kids but it is also ok to explain sometimes what could be a nice thing to do.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son could understand that at 3, then be advised that he was a bit precocious - other 3yos won&#39;t have much ability to see things from others&#39; perspectives, which is why many 3yos still aren&#39;t very interestied in other young children, or if they are have very poor social skills!

At about the age of 3 he shows an interest to see other children (he kept asking to see this or that child etc). So I did try to meet up more often with other mum with similar aged kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year I was new to homeschooling and didn&#39;t know about unschooling. I met someone who I think is doing unschooling. Her son is about the same age as my son, so we thought we&#39;d try to meet up to see if they get on.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day I invited this family and another family also with kids of similar age as my son. At some point, I was the only adult to be with the kids as the other mums were chatting in the kitchen. At that moment, one of the boys was playing with my son&#39;s train set that my son was also so much into at that stage. My son didn&#39;t mind that he played with his trains, but he wanted to join in the play as he always does it with me and my husband. But this kid from the unschooling mum was shouting at my son &quot;get off, get off it&quot;. My son was very sad because he really wanted to play together, and also from my point of view that was the main reason of inviting these kids to our place. I tried to give my son another train to play with and explained that he wants to play on his own for now (as I remember his mum once told me that she doesn&#39;t ask her son to share if he deosn&#39;t want to) but my son said with lots of tears that he wants to play with this kid. I then asked this kid gently if my son could join his play, he said no, leave me alone. I then asked again, could he take turn/share as this is my son&#39;s toys? He said very forcefully, I hate you, I don&#39;t want to play here anymore. That broke my heart.

So many parents force their kids to share. When my kids were that age, and even several years older, I would help them put some toys away before playdates. Before a playdate we would put toys in their room that they didn&#39;t want to share and leave out toys that they were comfortable with their friend using. Sometimes they would even get excited about picking out toys that they knew their friend would like. If a struggle came up during the playdate I would say something like, &quot;------ is not ready to share that right now.&quot; Then I would offer the friend another toy to play with. It was a way of respecting my child&#39;s need/desire to not share. Most parents say, &quot;You need to share your toys.&quot; IMO, that is being disrespectful of the child who is not ready to do that. Kids at that age and older are wanting a sense of ownership and &quot;mine.&quot; <br/>\nAt age 3, I was maintained close contact with my children during playdates because there can often be conflicts. My role was, and still is, at times, the role of a mediator. Lots of parental involvement at a young age usually means less later on. <br/>\nPerhaps he feels safer with adults because he knows they won&#39;t grab his stuff. Or, maybe that is just where he is at right now. <br/>\nBest,<br/>\nSharon <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;shackleton@...&quot; &lt;shackleton@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi, <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m new here.

So it turns into a rule, something that a child might comply with, if he or she is in the mood, or will resist if not in the mood. True sharing is something that arises from a sense of abundance and caring, and if you are generous and caring of your child, he can&#39;t help but learn the value of those things. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s very protective of his own things, have play-dates elsewhere or discover which things are most dear and put them away when company comes to visit. Company coming over is a good time to have a rule, actually, like &quot;no guests in the bedroom&quot;. That gives you a place to put things your ds doesn&#39;t want to share, and a place for your ds to retreat if he needs a break (may not be an issue for him, but it is for one of my kids). <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, many kids who aren&#39;t willing to &quot;share&quot; are much more willing to &quot;take turns&quot; - but that can take a good deal of adult facilitation, saying &quot;when you&#39;re done with that, so-and-so would like a turn&quot; and then keeping so-and-so happy and distracted while waiting. Whenever your child is playing with others, be in the midst of it all. That will give your friends something else to complain about ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, that&#39;s the other side of the whole thing - moms get together to have some adult conversational time and wouldn&#39;t it be nice if toddlers and young children would keep each other entertained? Too bad toddlers and young children don&#39;t have the social skills to do that on their own very well. Kids need more than &quot;supervision&quot; they need adult presence and support.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; He is very social with adults<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lots of kids are more social with adults than other children - especially homeschooled (including unschooled) kids, who aren&#39;t stuck in the insanity of dozens of children to a single adult. Its Natural for kids to want to hang around adults - they want the benefit of our knowledge and perspective (they just don&#39;t want it shoved on them).  <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":146052230,"authorName":"Sacha Davis","from":"&quot;Sacha Davis&quot; &lt;sacha@...&gt;","profile":"sacha_pie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Sociability","postDate":"1281634381","msgId":44635,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0MDcuMTI4Ljk1LjIzOC4xOTYuMTI4MTYzNDM4MS5zcXVpcnJlbEB3ZWJtYWlsLmRyaXp6bGUuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGkzdnVlZStjbGNvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"IDxpM3Z1ZWUrY2xjb0BlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":44632,"nextInTopic":44636,"prevInTime":44634,"nextInTime":44636,"topicId":44628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Sarah!
