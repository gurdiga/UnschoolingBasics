You&#39;ve only<br/>\nbeen unschooling for 3 weeks.  They&#39;ve lived a life with at least some<br/>\nrestrictions, limitations and boundaries for 4 and 7 years.  Yes; a &quot;detox&quot;<br/>\nperiod is definitely going to have to happen.  Join them when they are<br/>\nwatching TV and on the computer.  Find out what they are doing that is SO<br/>\ninteresting to them right now.  Start strewing some things.  Phrase things<br/>\nin statements rather than questions.  For instance instead of saying, &quot; Do<br/>\nyou wanto to go to the park?&quot;  say &quot;I&#39;m feeling cooped up and need some air,<br/>\nlet&#39;s all go to the park and kick the soccer ball around for a while.&quot;  or<br/>\n&quot;Hey, it&#39;s story time at the library.

Let&#39;s go and afterwards we can look at the computer software that the<br/>\nlibrary offers for checkout.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI never made a big announcement to the kids that they were free from all the<br/>\ncontrols.  I simply started saying yes more and no less.  Eventually the<br/>\nkids caught on that I wasn&#39;t as &quot;mean&quot; as I was before and not long after<br/>\nthat they glommed onto the word &quot;unschooling&quot; (which my oldest decided to<br/>\ngoogle to find out more about :) )  Your kids are still pretty young but<br/>\nthey are new to these freedoms.  They have to build your trust that you<br/>\naren&#39;t going to take away those freedoms again.  3 weeks isn&#39;t a very long<br/>\ntime to build that trust.  You may have given them more freedoms in the past<br/>\nand then tightened the reins again fairly quickly.  They maybe in a holding<br/>\npattern waiting to see when &quot;summer vacation&quot; is going to end this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur role as unschooling parents isn&#39;t to sit on the sidelines and watch.<br/>\nOur role is to be active and mindful of their needs and to help enrich their<br/>\nlives through participation.  And have you &quot;detoxed&quot; yourself as well?  Have<br/>\nyou lessened the restirictions that you have placed on yourself like<br/>\n*having* to do certain chores?  Have you changed the way in which you think<br/>\nabout the things you do in the house?  An exercise that I did about a year<br/>\nago (thanks to a post by Kelly about making choices) was to tell myself in<br/>\nmy head &quot;I choose to pick up these dishes in the living room&quot; when I would<br/>\nfind them (yet again) strewn in the living room (or maybe my kids were<br/>\nstrewing for me what they felt I liked doing :-D ) I would say to myself &quot;I<br/>\nchoose to do this load of laundry&quot; or &quot;I choose to sit at my hobby desk and<br/>\nmake a few cards&quot; or &quot;I choose to do the recycling today&quot; or &quot;I choose to<br/>\nclean the cat box.&quot;  I let go of the &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; and embraced the &quot;choose<br/>\nto&#39;s&quot;  Try it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nMichelle Leifur Reid<br/>\nYOUR Pampered Chef Consultant<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nCheck out my homeschool cooking classes!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":280005589,"authorName":"Sol√©","from":"=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Sol=E9?= &lt;solelokuai@...&gt;","profile":"solelokua","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] &#39;Detox&#39; period question...","postDate":"1157792678","msgId":17144,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBEMEE4MEU5LUQzMkQtNDhFQi1BRUVBLTk1RUJCMzcyQTIxRkBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVkdDJpbStndWFxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVkdDJpbStndWFxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17141,"nextInTopic":17146,"prevInTime":17143,"nextInTime":17145,"topicId":17141,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello Cara, we are unschooling for 2 weeks now :-) The first thing my daughter (7) did, was play computer ALL DAY.

Also, since there were no  <br/>\nbedtimes, she went to sleep at 2, 3, even if we were in bed already.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince 2 days, the computer is kind of &quot;out&quot;.

So yes, tehre is definetely a detox period, I think  <br/>\nthey call it &quot;deschooling&quot; here :-) It may take longer for your kids  <br/>\nuntil they find out that there is more to life than TV and PC.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how it is, but maybe you are showing them that you don&#39;t  <br/>\nlike this behaviour. They might fear that the limits come back. So  <br/>\nthey feel they have to hurry up and do as much as they can now!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother problem is probably that there is only one computer. I know  <br/>\nit&#39;s not very cheap to buy another one but if this is causing them to  <br/>\nstill feel they are limited in their freedom it might be worth it.  <br/>\nThere are cheap, used ones and if you cannot afford it now you can  <br/>\nwork out a plan on how to finance it (save up...) I&#39;m not from the  <br/>\nUS, but some here have been talking about some cheap thingy/place/???  <br/>\nwhere they wait (?) for a cheap computer, maybe you can ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, you are clearly seeing &quot;imagination play&quot; and going to  <br/>\nthe party, playing outside and so on as more valuable than watching  <br/>\nTV and playing on the computer.
