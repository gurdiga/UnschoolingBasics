I mean, I know they <br/>\nare still there, but they  are owned by someone else.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI talked to Pam, who started the new forum. Her first answer was &quot;because  we <br/>\nCOULD!&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nHer bigger answer was: &quot;The old message boards are not reliable, and  we <br/>\nthought it would be nice to have a forum run by a nonprofit organization  which <br/>\nwas specifically created to promote unschooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that HEM isn&#39;t really  promoting unschooling anymore - that they <br/>\ndon&#39;t want unschooling to be  considered something different than other <br/>\nhomeschooling. I think there are  enough of us radicals that aren&#39;t in that same boat. <br/>\nUnschooling IS different  and sometimes even so FAR from school-at-home that <br/>\nwe&#39;re not even in the  same swimming hole. <br/>\n <br/>\nThat the boards were  down for so long was disturbing to me----not that they <br/>\nmay have been working  feverishly to get them back up---who knows? But I&#39;m <br/>\nglad that there&#39;s a new  place for folks to go that is owned and run by people <br/>\nwho care deeply about Holt  and unschooling and mindful parenting.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s still in the  infant stage---Pam&#39;s put something new on every time I log <br/>\non. It seems very  user-friendly---even to me! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIt may, in time,  replace the old boards. Depends on Helen and HEM, I guess. <br/>\nRight now, it&#39;s  just another forum---for those who like &#39;em.<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope to see y&#39;all  there!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] new message boards @ Center for Unschooling Information","postDate":"1095556193","msgId":3232,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2UwMWM0OWRlNSQ2MjIxN2QxMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBob21lPg==","referencesHeader":"PDkwLjRiZDIxNjNmLjJlN2RlMGJmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3229,"nextInTopic":3234,"prevInTime":3231,"nextInTime":3233,"topicId":3227,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is this meant to replace the old unschooling boards?
