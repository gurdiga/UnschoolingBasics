Both my boys got calendars (with cool photos=2<br/>\n0of something they love) and journals for Christmas. But not for any other reason than they wanted them. Isn&#39;t THAT the reason for a gift? Why are you gifting with an agenda?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling has a lot to do with the motivation behind the parents&#39; actions. If you choose to go to the museum with the idea that the children will learn something, it&#39;s not unschooling. If you go because there&#39;s something there that might inspire you child or tickle his fancy---or even something that they may never get the opportunity to see again---THAT&#39;s unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy family is going to the Pompeii exhibit at Discovery Place in Charlotte this coming weekend. These are the last days of the exhibit in the US. I&#39;d hate for any of us to miss such an opportunity. Duncan (12) will more than likely fly through the exhibit while the rest of us us slowly read most of the signs. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll enjoy the volcano stuff. But he likes Discovery Place---it&#39;s fun. We&#39;ll all get something out of the trip. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you bake cookies so that the kids will learn fractions? Or do you bake cookies to have something really yummy? Fractions should be the by-product. Learning about Pompeii will be our by-product (or maybe something completely different---who can know?), but sharing the day together is the goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"Kelly Lovejoy","from":"Kelly Lovejoy &lt;kbcdlovejo@...&gt;","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: learning about unschooling","postDate":"1230571224","msgId":37465,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQjM3RjBERThGMzlCOC05RDgtRTE3QE1CTEstTTAzLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdqYXZtaytrY3VwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37464,"nextInTopic":37469,"prevInTime":37464,"nextInTime":37466,"topicId":37445,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hmm...

Using  <br/>\n&quot;had to&quot; lets parents mentally off the responsibility hook. It&#39;s like  <br/>\nthere&#39;s some outside force we can blame our actions on.

Depends.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor someone who is consciously trying to change their thinking it&#39;s  <br/>\ngood to &quot;fake it until you make it&quot;. But it&#39;s not possible to just  <br/>\nfake it. Kids have good bull cookie detectors. They know when we have  <br/>\na hidden agenda. It&#39;s really not possible to cling to a need for a  <br/>\nchild to write without that showing.
