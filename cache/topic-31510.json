When there&#39;s<br/>\nsomething he wants/needs to be up in the morning for, when he knows he<br/>\nneeds to get to sleep *before* midnight (and he&#39;s had the freedom to<br/>\nexplore the whole concept of &#39;enough sleep&#39; since he around 4 or 5 when<br/>\nbedtime went byebye), he generally just snuggles in our bed with us<br/>\ninstead of going to his room once *I* need to turn out the lights and go<br/>\nto sleep (which is usually between 10 and 11). Yeah, sometimes he pops<br/>\nin at random times (like the other night, he popped in 2 or 3 times to<br/>\ntell me tidbits of whatever) but by and large he knows I need my sleep<br/>\nto get up for work. If he starts feeling lonely, he knows he&#39;s always<br/>\nwelcome to come quietly snuggle in with us for the night or for a few<br/>\nminutes or hours, his choice. I noticed that if he stayed in with us,<br/>\nhe&#39;d fall right to sleep many times where if he chose to go back to his<br/>\nroom, he&#39;d be up for hours longer so I try to deliberately encourage him<br/>\nto stay and snuggle with me on nights before we have something the next<br/>\nday (even if it&#39;s an evening event, since by then he&#39;s usually ready to<br/>\nsleep and needs to be home and able to just curl up and sleep). I don&#39;t<br/>\neven try to be &quot;all there&quot; at 3 am for DS - I&#39;ll wake enough to<br/>\nacknowledge that he&#39;s talking to me but if it&#39;s something that warrants<br/>\nfurther discussion, I&#39;ll ask that he remind me of it during the day so<br/>\nwe can talk more (most often it&#39;s tidbits about a plotline or a future<br/>\nbroadcast that he just found out about or whatever - like when he found<br/>\nout that the entire Star Wars saga is going to be broadcast starting<br/>\nsoon (tonight?))<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that to say, perhaps find a way (discuss together) to encourage<br/>\nearlier to bed when there&#39;s something she wants to do in the morning.<br/>\nOh, also, DS will sometimes request that I make him a &#39;relaxing<br/>\nbeverage&#39; and I know just what he wants - take a cup of milk (dairy or<br/>\nnot as you prefer) and add a pat of butter (or butter like substance of<br/>\nyour choice, but real butter tastes best in this). Microwave for about a<br/>\nminute, until the butter is pretty much melted. Stir in a favorite<br/>\nsweetener to taste (we use honey or agave nectar but real maple syrup is<br/>\nalso really good here). It&#39;s usually just warm enough to sip right away<br/>\n(not too hot) and it is quite relaxing even if non-dairy milks don&#39;t<br/>\nhave the same &#39;sleepy&#39; chemical in them, the warmth is often enough to<br/>\nrelax things - it&#39;s also very soothing to a dry or scratchy throat (but<br/>\nnot so good if there&#39;s a lot of mucous involved). Plus, I&#39;ll usually sit<br/>\nthere in the kitchen with him while he drinks it so it&#39;s a way to unwind<br/>\nin the quiet as well. Yeah, he could do it by himself (he can handle the<br/>\nmicrowave like a pro when he wants) but having me there seems to help (I<br/>\ntry to &#39;exude&#39; sleepy thoughts/vibes at him lol).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

She <br/>\nspends most of her night watching ONDEMAND tv and surfing the net. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe used to be totally ok with this, except for the occasional day <br/>\nwhen she wanted to go somewhere specific and was too tired to get out <br/>\nof bed to make it there. <br/>\n<br/>\nLately, however , I think she&#39;s been very lonely on this shift, as I <br/>\nam asleep during those hours. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night she woke me up 4 times! Once because she had read about a <br/>\npregnant man, and wanted to discuss how that was possible. Another <br/>\ntime to watch a youtube video of a video game she had found that had <br/>\ncreeped her out. Another to show me that she learned all the words to <br/>\na Japanese song (in Japanese!) that she had listened to on the net. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s great she&#39;s coming to me when she is puzzled by <br/>\nsomething, or finds something neat and wants to share it with <br/>\nsomeone..but it&#39;s hard for me to be there for her at 3:30 AM!<br/>\n<br/>\nI did talk to her a little about sleeping at night instead of day, <br/>\nbut she says she is not even tired at night, and doesn&#39;t know how to <br/>\nmake herself so. <br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot stay up all night (though I did try to stay awake until 1:00 <br/>\nam for her,  and woke up when she called me!) Today I am completely <br/>\nexhausted! I don&#39;t function well on such little sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think she would like to sleep at night..but she&#39;s always been a <br/>\nnight owl, and we don&#39;t know how to straighten her out. Sometimes, we <br/>\ncan get it under control for about a week, but before too long, she <br/>\nslips right back into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice on how we could find a way to spend time together without <br/>\none of us losing much needed sleep?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31509,"nextTopicId":31514}}
