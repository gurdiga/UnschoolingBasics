Even <br/>\nwith a snorkel?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs he afraid of water in general?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen mine were young we had a big container of bath toys and some bath&#39;s <br/>\nwere a &#39;play tubby&#39; where they could play to their heart&#39;s contents.  I&#39;d <br/>\nadd warm water every half hour or so as needed.  I had some fun-shaped <br/>\nsoaps that they would play with and once in while we got a bar that had a <br/>\ntoy at the core, so as they used it the toy emerged.  I made sure the water <br/>\nwas not deep enough to go over their ears so their faces stayed dry and I <br/>\ntold them how much I enjoyed lying back in the tub as a boy, and pushing <br/>\nmyself up and down the rub with my hands and feet, making waves. Eventually <br/>\nthey loved to lie back in the tub and let their hair float, and if I stayed <br/>\naway and didn&#39;t try to wash it, so they always felt in control, it got <br/>\npretty clean.  Their fear was a control issue; having someone else wash <br/>\ntheir hair took control away from them, made them feel powerless and at <br/>\nanother&#39;s mercy.  For some this is not a trust issue. or a feeling unsafe <br/>\nwith a particular person issue. It&#39;s just the way they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrushing/de-tangling is another story.  I used a ton of no-more-tangles on <br/>\nmy daughters&#39; hair, but it still hurt them.  I have a very sensitive head <br/>\nalso.  One thing that might help relax him is to begin giving him gentle <br/>\nscalp massages, very gentle.  A very sensitive head really appreciates a <br/>\ngentle scalp massage.  No brushing or combing, just the <br/>\nmassage.  Eventually he may let you use a brush on just then ends at first.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as Dad&#39;s attitude goes, while I understand his feelings, I hope he <br/>\ncan realize that the opinions of others mean nothing, and only have the <br/>\npower we assign to them.  My oldest is 35 now.  When he was 4 he had the <br/>\nmost beautiful head of chestnut banana curls you&#39;ve ever seen, and we got <br/>\nplenty of looks and comments about his &#39;girly&#39; hair from strangers and <br/>\nfamily alike.  But I haven&#39;t thought of that since then, until now.  It <br/>\nmeans nothing at all to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12:59 PM 1/5/2008 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In a message dated 1/5/2008 8:26:39 A.M.

Papa has long hair too - to his waist, in fact. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes  he mind it is tangled?<br/>\nI&#39;m not really sure. I think he cares very little. But he clearly cares  what <br/>\nPapa thinks and what others say to him. It&#39;s myself and my dad that (and  his <br/>\nwife) that say next to nothing, usually nothing. His big brother and  <br/>\nsisters, Papa, my mom and his Tios tease him. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou  can have him in dreads. <br/>\nIt&#39;s kinda like one, single dread now :)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can  untangle with your hands ( just gently pull apart the hair) Tkes a <br/>\nlogn time  and patience but works great.<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried a bit, but will try more. He&#39;s VERY head sensitive, and now fear  <br/>\nis adding to it - adrenaline, anxiety over it. So now, the emotional aspects <br/>\nare  equally as painful as the physical. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe  might decide he just wants it shaved off. No hair to deal with. just and <br/>\ninch  of fur.<br/>\nHe&#39;s scared silly of that idea. Change is not cool with Mr. Julian right  now <br/>\n- I *think* he thinks he won&#39;t be HIM anymore, so as for now, that&#39;s not an  <br/>\noption. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe  might like to use a braid or pony tail to keep hair from getting  matted.<br/>\nTried that, but the brushing it took to get the braid or pony in was so  hard <br/>\nfor him, this is now the result. Power struggles are HORRID and that&#39;s what  <br/>\nseems to be happening over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs  for washing my ds is the same way but he does eventually let me wash it. <br/>\nI am  just super careful not to get his face wet.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve tried so many ways to make sure that doesn&#39;t happen. It&#39;s his fear of  <br/>\nit happening that seems to be the worst part. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe  did go longs times without washing and his hair still felt and smelled  <br/>\nwonderful ( as much as 4-6 weeks)<br/>\nWe&#39;ve done that too, but it didn&#39;t smell &quot;wonderful.&quot; Not bad though  either. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou  can use self rinse shamppos ( no water needed) <br/>\nTHAT sounds GREAT! Where are they??? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou  can use a little spray with conditioner or essencial oils and water to <br/>\nhelp  demmatt and clean if needed.<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking of a product called Dread Remover - it&#39;s just costly, and  since <br/>\nit&#39;s not Julian&#39;s desire, I wonder if it should be bought or not, kwim? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEven  corn starch and baking soda can be used to keep hair clean I  heard.<br/>\nGreat ideas! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy  ds did not need anything as his hair really never got dirty or tangled ( <br/>\nvery  sliky).<br/>\nAs for dad you need to talk to him.<br/>\nRemind him of all the manly  man that has long hair and that it is a self <br/>\nexpression he needs to  respect.<br/>\nSo many big, strong maly guys have long hair.<br/>\nYeah, that&#39;s not the issue. It&#39;s what appears to be dirty hair. It&#39;s about  <br/>\nhow people perceive him as a dad, me as a mom. I&#39;m 100% sure that&#39;s the issue  <br/>\n(as I said before, Papa has long hair, black and to his waist - he&#39;s Mexican <br/>\nand  it&#39;s just dashing...and having Mexican/Caucasian hair seems to be an issue <br/>\ntoo -  the textures are here and there, but not well combined - seems a few <br/>\nother  &quot;halo-halo&quot; kids I know have the same issue with it - Mexican-Cauc. that <br/>\n is)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBullying his son will most likely erode the little boy&#39;s self steem  and <br/>\ntheir relationship.<br/>\nI know. Sigh. Papa is not an unschooler, but is trying in many ways to come  <br/>\naround. I&#39;m trying by showing, but I have become quite...erm...bitchy. Juan is <br/>\n an authoritarian style parent, we have cultural differences, Unschooling is  <br/>\nterrifying to him I think in some ways (yet other ways, he&#39;s all easy going,  <br/>\nlike video games, TV, all media). So all of that seems to be literally, <br/>\nwrapped  up in Julian&#39;s hair. Perhaps I should get India.Arie&#39;s song, &quot;I&#39;m Not My <br/>\nHair&quot;  as a mantra for Julian to proclaim :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks, Alex. Maybe I just need to mull this all over and practice  following <br/>\nmy heart. Juan and I NEVER get any time alone to talk, and in fact,  our <br/>\nmarriage is in a shambles right now :(  Our parenting differences and  the <br/>\nresulting tension has bled into our other aspects, too. It&#39;s all related, I  know. <br/>\nAnd the hair is almost a manifestation of it...I hate this. Struggling a  LOT <br/>\nthese days. Your advice and help is really appreciated. Thanks again. <br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Start the year off right.

He never says ouch with this<br/>\nbrush and will in fact try to use it himself.  The brand name is <br/>\nBass and the number on it is 876SB.  100% wild boar/ soft.  I <br/>\nhad the stomach flu a last week and my hair was a wild matted<br/>\nmess and my dd brushed my hair for me and it never once hurt<br/>\nas she detangled it!  I think it cost about $12.
