It&#39;s the learning that happens when our minds are engaged and interested. It&#39;s also the learning that happens when we&#39;re daydreaming and pensive. Think of a fun and interesting day of summer vacation. That&#39;s unschooling. Think of a rainy weekend at home watching TV and baking cookies with the kids. That&#39;s unschooling. Think about bringing the world to your children and then happily assisting them as they explore, investigate, gaze, ponder and learn.

Unschooling is about removing the <br/>\nlocus of control from an external source (the state, the parents) and <br/>\nputting it back where it really belongs, within the learner.
