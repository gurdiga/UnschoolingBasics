I<br/>\nthink they handled those better than playing the Playstation at a<br/>\nyounger age.   One thing that I have always reminded my kids of when<br/>\nthey get frustrated with any type of game is that playing games is<br/>\nlike learning a sport or anything else you have to practice and doing<br/>\nit perfectly or just right doesn&#39;t just happen normally the first<br/>\ntime.   I try to help them understand that the fun is playing it again<br/>\nand again until you get better and better at it.    Now at ages 13 and<br/>\n7 they are so thrilled to come tell me they are now at level 10 or<br/>\nwhatever in their games.   They love to take the DS along in the car<br/>\nor whenever we have to wait somewhere. I really think younger kids<br/>\nlike the DS because it&#39;s small and just theirs... it&#39;s sure made alot<br/>\nof long waits and long trips more pleasant!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have a Gamecube, Playstation , Playstation 2 and now a Wii and<br/>\nthey are my biggest video gamers... my older two play here and there<br/>\nbut aren&#39;t that into it and never have been.
