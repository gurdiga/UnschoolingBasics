Somethings are easy for me to transition away from, others hard. Writing is something I have a hard time transitioning away from, I&#39;ve discovered. And the more stress I&#39;m under, the harder it is. So if I&#39;m tired, hungry, hot and need to pee I&#39;m going to be (somewhat ironically) really cranky about walking away from the computer!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m very bad about snacks.

So being good about snacks is something George and I both struggle with, to some extent, bc Mo&#39;s not consistent in her needs. What I&#39;ve found helpful is to create a sort of schedule for myself to bring her food at intervals - I&#39;ll plan my day around bringing snacks. I also have a mental trick I use, kind of like the old fashioned string tied around the finger. I &quot;tie&quot; an idea to something. So, maybe I&#39;ll tie the idea of snacks to my glasses.

Would he like a timer to remind him to get up and stretch? With a game, it would probably be better to do at a save point - that&#39;s something to talk about, too. What does he think about taking a break every time he &quot;levels up&quot;?

To some extent, its a matter of how much of it you take, personally.

But I also have to remind myself to apply some of that skill to my family. If *I&#39;m* upset, too, I can&#39;t help anyone. Its harder with my family, though.

Don&#39;t interrupt his game to solve the problem you see, help to be part of the solution. We have socks that are filled with rice and a few cloves for scent that can be microwaved for about a minute or a minute and a half and they are lovely to put on a sore neck or shoulders. You could make one of those to use when your son complains of stiffness. You could just empathize, don&#39;t solve it, maybe say something like &quot;yeah, sometimes when I sit for too long I get a sore neck too.&quot; But I wouldn&#39;t do that when he&#39;s playing the game.

How else can you maintain your sanity?  I get up early to enjoy peace and quiet (but then again I&#39;m a morning person).  Sometimes during the day if it&#39;s been particularly rough I&#39;ll ask for some family quiet time while my emotions calm back down.  We&#39;ve discussed how getting upset releases chemicals in the body and it takes time for them to go away again, and during that time you get more upset if they keep getting triggered, so 15 min. of quiet time can be needed to get back to normal again.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people have food sensitivities that throw off their body chemistry and make them irritable.  I find when I cut out certain foods I am much more even emotionally.  Maybe something he&#39;s eating is bothering him physically.  My daughter used to have a list of things that would set her off but now it&#39;s down to pretty much gummi candy.  Often the food they&#39;re sensitive to is the one they eat addictively or at least daily (for me it&#39;s chocolate!).

It seems similar to deschooling, and almost like he&#39;s stuck on repeat. He tells me all the time, that he hates when he explodes at someone but he can&#39;t control it.

You can support him without dooming him to poor posture and carpal tunnel, but to do that its not going to be helpful to say &quot;take a break&quot; - he doesn&#39;t want a break any more than an artist wants to take a break in the middle of a creative frenzy.

Has anything else changed recently? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve been unschooling for two years. Nothing has happened or changed recently. It seems similar to deschooling, and almost like he&#39;s stuck on repeat. He tells me all the time, that he hates when he explodes at someone but he can&#39;t control it. I understand that but it&#39;s hard to take all. the. time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It sounds like he needs some help transitioning. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He does need help with transitions. A &quot;countdown&quot; usually helps (telling him there is 30 min, then 15 min, then 5 until we start getting ready to leave) but sometimes it doesn&#39;t. A portable game may help. Thanks for that idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I don&#39;t understand is why when it&#39;s the television of video games or anything else (except playing with friends!), he doesn&#39;t have the same transition trouble. It&#39;s computer games and friends. Maybe because he&#39;s more involved, enjoying himself more with those things? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; While he&#39;s on the computer, what are you doing? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;re usually in the same room, he shares what he&#39;s doing and I try ot stay involved as much as he wants (which sometimes is often and sometimes very little). I will admit, I&#39;m very bad about snacks. I&#39;ve been thinking about this recently. I have a very small appetite and it&#39;s easy for me to forget about snacks, and even delay meals. I&#39;m working on it, I promise! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What if you offer a backrub instead? Do things to help him be more comfortable now. Look into chairs that support better posture, or exercise balls - the kind that are big enough to sit on.

You can support him without dooming him to poor posture and carpal tunnel, but to do that its not going to be helpful to say &quot;take a break&quot; - he doesn&#39;t want a break any more than an artist wants to take a break in the middle of a creative frenzy.

Outside the situation he is open to the ideas. When he&#39;s getting sore and I mention it, it&#39;s a disruption he doesn&#39;t want. I know he&#39;s in the moment and I understand not wanting to interupt the flow. I feel the same way when I&#39;m involved in something. But I&#39;m flip-flopping between how much I should step in.

Once he  <br/>\nfeels like he can have it any time he wants, as much as he wants,  <br/>\nhe&#39;ll slow down. If you put the controls back on, it will be worse  <br/>\nnext time!
