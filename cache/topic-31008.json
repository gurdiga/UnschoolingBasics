Your son is in a pretty heady place, being so <br/>\ntalented, with older and professional musicians seeing his talent. <br/>\nThere is much to be learned by crossing genre&#39;s. This could be part <br/>\nof the attraction of the orchestral gig, and the attraction of this <br/>\nteacher. I wonder if you can talk with your son and help him explore <br/>\nwhy he wants to do the orchestral gig; help him think through the <br/>\npros and cons. I think of it as helping him (and you) get grounded. <br/>\nAnd I think of it as your being a choice-coach, or an agent (like a <br/>\ntrue musician&#39;s agent), helping his find his clarity, which can be <br/>\nobscured in these heady, teenage times.

It really helps put it in perspective. We can get <br/>\na little dizzy sometimes- fun dizzy - but I want to be careful to stay <br/>\nin the present, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year my son was considering going on tour playing at Magic <br/>\ntournaments as a career option but now is hardly playing at all. He <br/>\nwants to spend his money on other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is fun to speculate about his future- his dad especially tends to go <br/>\nin that direction. I find myself often trying to de-emphasize that <br/>\naspect in the household and leave it to my son to take the lead with <br/>\nthose ideas. Not everything has to go somewhere- not every thought or <br/>\naction has some greater purpose - or not one we can see, anyway. My <br/>\nhusband seems to create his own picture of what should be happening or <br/>\nwhat the best path is that to me is totally confusing and besides the <br/>\npoint. I want to enjoy what is going on now and give my son the space to <br/>\ndo that too. It does seem natural for him to see what others are doing <br/>\nand to try on different ideas- to go in one direction or another for a <br/>\nawhile. Right now it is music school. We went to a faculty recital at <br/>\nthe college at which his teacher played with the trumpet professor - <br/>\nalso some graduates of the music program. Pretty interesting view of <br/>\nacademia and graduates who are finding their way doing various things. <br/>\nLots ways to go even with the field of music. We have a lot of different <br/>\nexamples- have local musician friends who make a living at performing, <br/>\nrecording, and teaching outside the university system as well. One <br/>\nfriend is planning to major in drums and music therapy- wow!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is making a whole lot of little fuzzy stuffed bears right <br/>\nnow- another adult asked her what the purpose was yesterday- what she <br/>\nwill do with them. She is just having so much fun making them that she <br/>\nwants to keep doing it! Doesn&#39;t need a purpose- that is hard for many <br/>\nadults to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am enjoying myself so much doing things that are just about doing <br/>\nthem- without it having to go somewhere- when I make things people are <br/>\nalways asking me if I am going to sell them. Maybe I&#39;ll just have a <br/>\nmillion, or just give them away one day when I want to make space for a <br/>\nnew project!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will tell you that I was in a similar boat.

He began by exploring on his own, listening, playing with tab and by <br/>\near, and has had various lessons and experiences of an informal nature <br/>\nuntil last summer. We live in a small college town. He mainly plays <br/>\nupright and electric bass and there arelimited options for mentors on <br/>\nthe upright bass. One college has a reputable music department and the <br/>\nprofessor of bass there agreed to take on my son as a regular student. <br/>\nHe is a very interesting person, a composer/performer across genres, and <br/>\nteaches a method that emphasizes ergonomics and comfort to extend the <br/>\nrange and improve sound quality. I think we are all a bit in awe of <br/>\nhim. He treats my son as he does the undergrads he teaches- he expects <br/>\na lot and pushes him to perfect technique. My son has said he will do <br/>\nanything that this teacher says- I think because he really wants to play <br/>\nas well as possible and has a lot of respect for this teacher&#39;s ability <br/>\nto help him do that. They work on a lot of theory and writing and <br/>\nplaying jazz lines, transcribing, as well as scales and working at what <br/>\nseems like high speed through a series that emphasizes classical pieces. <br/>\nMy son enjoys a lot of it but some of it has become what seems like <br/>\nwork. He sets aside at least a couple of hours a day for preparing for <br/>\nthese lessons 5 days a week plus a day for a lesson. In addition he <br/>\nplays keyboard and acoustic guitar and electric guitar &quot;informally&quot; and <br/>\nperforms with various groups with other young people both independently <br/>\nand with the local high school. This weekend we heard him singing in his <br/>\nroom- one of his bands needs a singer and he has decided to give it a <br/>\ntry. It is pretty exciting to be a witness to his journey- and it is <br/>\npure joy listening to him play.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I feel like we are entering upon dangerous territory where his <br/>\nown desires might get confused with those of his teacher and other <br/>\nadults. The teacher suggested that he play in a youth orchestra- which <br/>\ninvolves an hour drive each way once a week every Sunday. He prefers to <br/>\nplay jazz, funk, rock, and listens to a lot of hip hop.
