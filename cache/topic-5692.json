Wes Beach is going to <br/>\naddress *just* this issue!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Cameron (17) is still registered as a homeschooler, but he&#39;s mostly <br/>\njust working. He has three paying gigs---two with  caterers and one <br/>\nwith a paper delivery, one volunteer gig at the local independent film <br/>\ntheatre, and a *very* busy (and profitable!) house/petsitting service <br/>\nthat he&#39;s started. He also has a band; they are working on three new <br/>\nsongs and on getting a gig at a local bar before the end of the summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI take what he&#39;s doing at work and use it for &quot;school&quot; records. I can <br/>\nalso include his travel and what we do at home (talks, movies, games, <br/>\netc.) as school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve asked him whether he&#39;d like to be &quot;graduated&quot; this summer or keep <br/>\non keeping on as a homeschooler. No answer yet, but it&#39;s really just <br/>\nmore of what we&#39;ve been doing, so I doubt he&#39;ll make any changes. It&#39;s <br/>\njust too easy to do what we&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou *could* used his job as a &quot;work-study&quot; program that your very <br/>\nprogressive homeschool has implemented! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\nOctober 6-9, 2005<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: soggyboysmom &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debra.rossing@...\">debra.rossing@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Uh, you can.

How can I unschool and follow the &quot;rules&quot; of the<br/>\nstate without feeling like I am lying to them? It is an issue. My 17<br/>\nyear old quit schooling altogether this year. He has a job and has<br/>\nworked there for a year. School traumitized him so badly that even the<br/>\nmention of learning anything turns him off. He has the rest of his life<br/>\nto live and learn. Still people are always asking him if he graduated,<br/>\nwill he get his GED, etc. It is a part of life. He just says he is<br/>\nhomeschooled and then people are satisfied. Now he is not homeschooled<br/>\nper his request. I still unschool my 14 year old. For the past 3 years I<br/>\nput together what ever he experienced and &quot;make it fit&quot; the mold of the<br/>\nstate. Another thing that really irks me is that if we can<br/>\nschool/unschool our kids at home legally why are we not allowed to<br/>\nlegally give them a graduation diploma that counts to enter college if<br/>\nthey care to go? I hope my kids decide to do some alternative employment<br/>\nlike alternative medicine, healing practice, organic farming, etc. I<br/>\ndont get to choose though:) Michele<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5682,"nextTopicId":5696}}
