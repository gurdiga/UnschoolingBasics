The games that are &quot;educational&quot; can be<br/>\nmore tricky (I think) to figure out by trial and error because they&#39;re<br/>\ndesigned to &quot;teach&quot; a particular skill, which means the goal is to get<br/>\nkids to &quot;practice&quot; that skill. My kids like the Clue Finders games, but<br/>\nalso get frustrated because of this approach on some of the puzzles.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would nonchalantly ask, &quot;Would you like me to show you how to do<br/>\nthat?&quot; and follow up with, &quot;Okay, cool. Just let me know if you change<br/>\nyour mind.&quot; I&#39;d want to leave the offer open without any pressure. I&#39;d<br/>\nwant my kids to know that there&#39;s a resource available if they choose to<br/>\nuse it, basically. If you had thought of it in the moment, I think you<br/>\ncould have put out there, &quot;I can show you how to do that pretty easily<br/>\non a calculator if you&#39;d like.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the focus needs to be the Trust that kids know whether they are<br/>\nready for a particular skill and that they will come back to it when<br/>\nthey&#39;re ready for it, though maybe in a different form or from a<br/>\ndifferent angle. Then, when they do come back to it, they will have the<br/>\npathways and the connections available to make the skill/ knowledge<br/>\nmeaningful to them. If that Trust is your focus and the guide for your<br/>\nactions, then the priorities are right, kwim?

There are some ways to work this <br/>\ninto other things - if you happen to be baking (not baking to make a <br/>\nlesson but it is the holiday season and baking happens), and you <br/>\nneed to manipulate fractions, do it out loud, &#39;expose&#39; your thought <br/>\nprocesses so to speak &quot;okay I&#39;m making extras of the spritz cookies <br/>\nso I need 1/2 C plus 1/3 C of brown sugar...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis kind of talking to myself figuring is how DS (7 1/2) <br/>\nabsorbed/learned things like doubling fractions (we make lots of <br/>\ncookies lol!) He was the measurer/recipe reader this past weekend <br/>\nand I was the stirrer (cookie dough can get stiff and hard for him <br/>\nto stir). We were making a double batch of choc chip cookies so we <br/>\ncould try out different varieties of chips (white choc swirl, pb <br/>\nswirl, raspberry, and plain of course). He&#39;d look at the recipe and <br/>\nsay &quot;We need 1 C of flour because this says 1/2 C and we&#39;re doubling <br/>\nit&quot;. When he got to the 3/4 C of sugar, that took a little <br/>\nassistance so I told him to use the top number x 2 (which he knew <br/>\nwas 6) so it was 6/4. Then he just used the quarter cup scoop six <br/>\ntimes as we talked about how 4/4 = 1 cup and that left 2/4 or 1/2 C <br/>\nso the six 1/4 scoops is the same as one 1 C scoop plus one 1/2 C <br/>\nscoop. (Personally, I&#39;ll often do the six 1/4 C scoops rather than <br/>\nusing two different measuring cups or use three 1/2 C scoops or <br/>\nwhatever - I try to minimize the amount of cleanup). The whole thing <br/>\ntook maybe 2 minutes and we moved on to the next item - which <br/>\nhappened to be 3/4C brown sugar - so he again did six 1/4C scoops <br/>\n(sans discussion) and off we went.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143188961,"authorName":"Ann","from":"Ann &lt;ann_mv05@...&gt;","profile":"ann_mv05","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"computer game math question","postDate":"1133967038","msgId":8082,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjA3MTQ1MDM4LjgyMDg3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzNDEwLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8083,"prevInTime":8081,"nextInTime":8083,"topicId":8082,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, I came up against a situation that caused me to wonder what other unschooling moms would do.
