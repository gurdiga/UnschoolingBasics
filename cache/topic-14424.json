There was a documentary about Hitler on, and I remembered Luke <br/>\n&gt; mentioning Hitler to me a couple of times over the last few months, <br/>\n&gt; so I told him it was on. He said he didn&#39;t want to watch it, so I <br/>\n&gt; said no problem and sat down to watch it myself. After a few minutes <br/>\n&gt; of watching it, I yelled into the other room to him, &quot;Hey Luke Did <br/>\n&gt; you know Hitler was a sex maniac?&quot; becasue the docuimentary said he <br/>\n&gt; was obseessed with sex. And Luke says--get this- I knew that! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Apparently, he has been researching Hitler at least a little bit to <br/>\n&gt; have known that. I&#39;m wondering what else he knows about him, but I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want to push the issue. So I let it drop. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then, Later in the evening,he is on the computer and I overhear him <br/>\n&gt; say to his brother, &quot;Did you know we&#39;re descendants of &quot;homo-<br/>\n&gt; erectus&quot; and he laughs. He liked the sound of the word because it <br/>\n&gt; says &quot;homo&quot; in it. He had asked the questions about the origin of <br/>\n&gt; man earlier today, and I ordered a book from the library, but I <br/>\n&gt; guess he wanted to know more now. SO HE WAS READING IT ON HIS OWN!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He still has a big problem with books, but reading on the web is <br/>\n&gt; wonderful! I wish he didn&#39;t have his aversion to real books, but <br/>\n&gt; maybe with time. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now my question is- what about math? My state requires that we cover <br/>\n&gt; Algebra and Geometry and I don&#39;t know either topic.

We do it all<br/>\nthe time.  When our checkbook doesn&#39;t balance by 52¢ there is an<br/>\nunknown element that is causing it to be off.  That is algebra.<br/>\nAlgebra is figuring out how many servings of brownies you will get if<br/>\nyou have 5 batches.  There is nothing mysterious about algebra.  What<br/>\nmakes algebra mysterious are textbooks trying to make people think in<br/>\nalgebraic ways through a serious of ever increasing problems which<br/>\nmake no sense to the majority of people who are having to do them in<br/>\norder to pass some class.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeometry is the math of shapes.  Most of it is totally irrelevant when<br/>\ndealing with real life.  How often do *most* people have to figure out<br/>\nwhat the volume is of a cone?  The only cone that most people deal<br/>\nwith on a regular bases seems to be an ice cream cone and the only<br/>\nreason that one needs to worry about the volume is when it is full and<br/>\nyou have a nice scoop on the top to start with.  I would presume that<br/>\nmany of us took geometry in high school or college.  How many of us<br/>\nremember how to figure out the volume of a cone?  We deal with shapes,<br/>\nthough, on an almost daily basis.  Putting boxes on shelves, cans in<br/>\ncupboards, soup in bowls, cutting out art projects, drawing, doodling,<br/>\ndecorating, moving furniture etc.  We see volume in those same boxes<br/>\nand cans.  When we cook we use geometry.  Measurements, volume,<br/>\nplacement of cookies on baking stones, having the right size pot for<br/>\nmac and cheese.  Geometry is not a static activity.  Geometry most<br/>\nmakes sense when it is used in context.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t force math on him.  Instead find a way to translate what he is<br/>\ndoing into the requirements of your state.

There was a documentary about Hitler on, and I remembered Luke <br/>\nmentioning Hitler to me a couple of times over the last few months, <br/>\nso I told him it was on. He said he didn&#39;t want to watch it, so I <br/>\nsaid no problem and sat down to watch it myself. After a few minutes <br/>\nof watching it, I yelled into the other room to him, &quot;Hey Luke Did <br/>\nyou know Hitler was a sex maniac?&quot; becasue the docuimentary said he <br/>\nwas obseessed with sex. And Luke says--get this- I knew that! <br/>\n<br/>\nApparently, he has been researching Hitler at least a little bit to <br/>\nhave known that. I&#39;m wondering what else he knows about him, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to push the issue. So I let it drop. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, Later in the evening,he is on the computer and I overhear him <br/>\nsay to his brother, &quot;Did you know we&#39;re descendants of &quot;homo-<br/>\nerectus&quot; and he laughs. He liked the sound of the word because it <br/>\nsays &quot;homo&quot; in it. He had asked the questions about the origin of <br/>\nman earlier today, and I ordered a book from the library, but I <br/>\nguess he wanted to know more now. SO HE WAS READING IT ON HIS OWN!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe still has a big problem with books, but reading on the web is <br/>\nwonderful! I wish he didn&#39;t have his aversion to real books, but <br/>\nmaybe with time. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow my question is- what about math? My state requires that we cover <br/>\nAlgebra and Geometry and I don&#39;t know either topic. I can&#39;t see him <br/>\nplaying with Algebra and Geometry of his own free will.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you get real life experience with Algebra and Geometry?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14449,"nextTopicId":14377}}
