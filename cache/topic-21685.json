I don&#39;t think that works anyway. My kids know me well enough, I think, to understand that I want them to understand why I believe what I believe, and that whatever they believe, I will love them and try to understand.  Two days ago my 7 yo son showed me that one night when he was mad, he hammered a metal fixture in the bathroom flat. I told him I was aware he was very angry that night, and thanked him for trusting me to care how he felt rather than be angry. He replied, &quot;I&#39;d trust you with anything.&quot; I felt really happy about that (and happy he didn&#39;t hit the hot water pipe 2 millimeters to the right). I guess for the most part I teach the kids that all humans are fallible, and to avoid anyone who claims that they are the oracle of truth.  Having said that, I do teach that there are some absolute wrong things in life. Not many, but some, and that one is killing.

He&#39;s not doing this bc of something he&#39;s read or someone made a <br/>\npoint of &quot;exposing&quot; him to the concepts. He hates to read books and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want any read to him. But he&#39;s really really interested in <br/>\nthese ideas so he&#39;s finding ways to explore them through music, 2d <br/>\narts, movies, tv, games, and discussion. Its a pretty intense <br/>\nprocess for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m forgetting where I learned this, but somewhere along the way I <br/>\ncame across a theory that this sort of philosophical exploration is <br/>\na developmental process - its normal for teens, especially. Its <br/>\ncertainly something I&#39;ve noticed many times in the alternative <br/>\ncommunity over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot everyone will choose to read Hiroshima, or The Handmaid&#39;s Tale, <br/>\nor A Gathering of Spirit. Those are personal decisions, not <br/>\nsomething to be imposed. If your dds are looking for that kind of <br/>\nreading, great, but if not, just as great. They will find a way to <br/>\nconnect with big ideas and difficult concepts (if that&#39;s what they <br/>\nare seeking) in other ways. Maybe even talking with you!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":299286442,"authorName":"Cameron Parham","from":"Cameron Parham &lt;acsp2205@...&gt;","profile":"acsp2205","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Basic confusion","postDate":"1172974769","msgId":21858,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI5NjU0Ni45MzUwMi5xbUB3ZWI1OTIwOC5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":21690,"nextInTopic":21870,"prevInTime":21857,"nextInTime":21859,"topicId":21685,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for your thoughtful reply.

Emily is aware that many children read later and that I am not concerned. However, she comes under pressures from other sources and I think this is the problem. I know that many unschoolers come under these pressures, and to an extent we must tolerate them and help the children see that we are confident in our lifestyles, ourselves, and them. It&#39;s just rather wearing in practice at times.  I am a single parent who manages to homeschool because I work 5 or 6 24 hour shifts a month and am home the rest of the time.     <br/>\n As to my question about the books I see as important: I already read books to the 3 kids daily. We love this. But there is a 5 year spread and some books I want my 13 yr old to be exposed to are not appropriate for the 7 and 10 yr olds.  I can not say they are all beloved by me. Some are downright painful (and some of these will wait for more maturity) such as Hiroshima, etc. But some books that are hard to read are very important.    I think the issues behind these two questions are deep philosophical issues, and the details may just distract from the real questions.                                                                                           from                                                                                                                                   ---- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Katharine Wise &lt;katharinewise@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSent: Sunday, February 25, 2007 7:22:47 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Basic confusion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But she still expresses the<br/>\n<br/>\nopinion that I should have &#39;made her do it&#39; earlier, though now she<br/>\n<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want that, and she didn&#39;t then.

I have<br/>\nseveral questions regarding our approach. I can&#39;t figure out how to ask<br/>\nthem succinctly.  For example, reading late (by common standards) then<br/>\nreading well runs in my family. So after reading many homeschooling and<br/>\nunschooling books, when I found my daughter had no real interest in<br/>\nreading, I did not worry. She is amazing and she will learn to read and<br/>\nprobably very well. But now for the problems. Part of our problem is<br/>\nthat the 3 kids have to go to a sitter for the 5 or 6 24-hour shifts I<br/>\nwork per month. I am the only support and this is unavoidable, and gives<br/>\nmany more days at home than most working parents have,  Our sitting<br/>\nfamily is loving and wonderful but quite different than we are. Their 4<br/>\nboys are homeschooled by a strict curriculum. They start early (not<br/>\nlater that 5 yrs old). Now those kids, despite their mothers&#39; support<br/>\n(at least to my face) harrass my kids with comparisons, which of course<br/>\nhurt. Furthermore, last summer my ex husband ask to visit the kids at<br/>\nhis far-away home for the first time in 3 years. He was the original<br/>\nproponent of homeschooling in our family, but now is engaged to an<br/>\n&#39;early child educator.&#39; He and she have decided maybe Em is dyslexic<br/>\n(plus other educator-jargon labels).  Now of course you aren&#39;t going to<br/>\nknow how to work with an ex-spouse and that&#39;s not my question.  These<br/>\npeople and others have undermined Em&#39;s confidence. She has said that<br/>\nit&#39;s my fault she isn&#39;t reading already.  Of course this pressure has<br/>\nnothing to do with her readiness but has hurt her feelings and her faith<br/>\nin me. So she asked me to work on her reading with her, and for a while<br/>\nit seemed she enjoyed it and felt confident and ready. Now she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to do it, and I have quietly let it be. But she still expresses the<br/>\nopinion that I should have &#39;made her do it&#39; earlier, though now she<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want that, and she didn&#39;t then.  In summary, how do you let<br/>\nthem go if they hold you responsible for the outcome? What do I do about<br/>\noutside pressures/comparisons? We have to spend time with so many people<br/>\nwho do that. I am mystified how so often people can compliment me on the<br/>\nkids&#39; kindness, nonjudgementalness,and creativity, while still<br/>\ncriticizing their (apparent) lack of academic pursuits. It&#39;s a basic<br/>\ntenet of our family that we are all imperfect, fallible, amazing<br/>\ntreasures. But they are very young to have the wisdom to   carry them<br/>\nthrough criticism by family and close friends.   Next question: how can<br/>\nkids explore the universe without some exposure to what&#39;s out there?   I<br/>\nread widely, involve myself in their interests and share mine with them.<br/>\nI remember when I was mulling over possible careers at age 20, one<br/>\nlimiting factor was my actual lack of knowlege of possible careers. You<br/>\ncan&#39;t pursue something you don&#39;t know exists. I do invite the kids to<br/>\nthe library, bookstores, etc.  I must admit, too, that I feel there are<br/>\ncertain books that are so important to read before growing up that I<br/>\nmust require they be read. Wha do I do with that?? And one more: my<br/>\noldest son has often spent so many consecutive days at the<br/>\nTV/computer/video games that he barely eats or talks or sleeps.  The<br/>\nmore he does it the farther away he seems. This isn&#39;t one of those &quot;if I<br/>\nlet him&quot; things. He had freedom to choose and did this for months at a<br/>\ntime.  I was a very daydreamy child and I think I recognize his<br/>\nbehavior.  But how can he know what else might interest him if he does<br/>\nso much of any one thing? Thanks. Please accept my apologies if my<br/>\nquestions seem confusing or too long.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22049,"nextTopicId":22067}}
