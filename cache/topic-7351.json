As William Shakespeare wrote in Romeo and Juliet, &quot;What&#39;s in <br/>\na  name?  That which we call a rose By any other name would smell as  sweet.&quot;<br/>\nI honestly don&#39;t think any is going to care WHAT you call yourselves. It  <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t even really matter. Why is it such an important issue for you to  <br/>\nlabel? This world is just chock full of labelling and it really gets  tiresome.<br/>\nIf you are doing what&#39;s right in YOUR gut, in YOUR heart for YOUR family,  <br/>\nthen THAT&#39;S all that matters. Call yourself whatever, it&#39;s not (and shouldn&#39;t)  <br/>\nchange what you do.<br/>\nMy family unschools... we don&#39;t use curriculum, we don&#39;t force anything on  <br/>\nour kids. However, we are not necessarily 100% following the complete  <br/>\nunschooling philosophy. We&#39;re new, and slowly wading in. We have &quot;bedtimes&quot;, but  they <br/>\nare flexible. We do run around doing errands, and, yeah, there might be a  <br/>\nprotest from someone, but we always make sure we do something fun during the  <br/>\ntrip too (we are limited since we only have one vehicle and DH works full-time,  <br/>\nwith no way of me driving him into work). We make sure we respect the kids&#39;  <br/>\nfeelings too. And we learn by living.<br/>\nAt this very moment, as I am typing, my son (almost 6) is playing  Spyro on <br/>\nPS... he is learning to read on his own because he gets tired of asking  us <br/>\nwhat it says. My daughter (4) is sitting next to me, taking over my desk  <br/>\ncoloring. She asks me to color certain pages, which she has been watching me do  it <br/>\nintently. And what is she &quot;learning&quot; from that? She is now more careful and  <br/>\nstaying in the lines as opposed to just scribbling. She&#39;s choosing colors from  <br/>\nthe box of crayons that suit her fancy. And &quot;learning&quot; colors too... that <br/>\nthere  isn&#39;t JUST blue, but cerulean and turquoise, and that the colors stretch <br/>\nbeyond  the basics. And my toddler? Randomly wandering the living room amongst <br/>\nthe mess  of toys, and picking out the Duplos and sticking them together. She <br/>\nis also  testing limits of how much she can pester her brother. And between all <br/>\nof us,  there is constant chatter. We are enjoying ourselves.

It is a philosophy that can and does permeate all of your life,<br/>\nincluding your parenting,  and that can take time.  Everyone will be at a<br/>\ndifferent place in the process and each family&#39;s journey will be different<br/>\nin the time frame and the details. The goal of these groups is to come along<br/>\nside and encourage people to go further in the process and sometimes that<br/>\ncan seem challenging. Whether you call yourself an unschooloer or not<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to change the process. For a long time I called myself a<br/>\nrelaxed eclectic homeschooler.  I still use that term in some groups if it&#39;s<br/>\nnot the time or place to discuss unschooling.  Every family comes to the<br/>\nunschooling process with their own set of family dynamics, their own<br/>\nworld-view, their own values and beliefs.   These will often be challenged<br/>\nin the sense that people will want you to think through why you do things or<br/>\nbelieve things.  For myself, unschooling has deepened by faith and beliefs<br/>\nbecause it has caused me to challenge these things and not accept anything<br/>\n&quot;just because&quot;, but to find the core of my values and beliefs.  My values<br/>\nand beliefs will influence how unschooling looks in our family, but no more<br/>\nthan my love of literature has influenced how unschooling looks for us.<br/>\nNeither my husband nor I are athletic or into sports, whether watching or<br/>\nparticipating, and that has influenced what unschooling looks like in our<br/>\nhouse. We have friends that are way into sports. If has greatly influenced<br/>\ntheir kids&#39; lives and how unschooling looks in their family. If I had a<br/>\nchild who decided to explore sports, I would find a way to make it happen,<br/>\nbut it won&#39;t happen naturally in our family. I live my values and beliefs<br/>\nwith my kids. It is my desire that they share my values and beliefs, but I<br/>\ncannot force them to do so. They have to find their own path and they are<br/>\nfree to do so.  And yet, it can all be unschooling.  Don&#39;t worry what you<br/>\ncall yourself, just be willing to ask questions, think about all the<br/>\ndifferent answers, find what works for you now and be willing to grow and<br/>\nchange as you learn more.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-19, Lisa-16, Karl-14, & Ben-10.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reachhomeschool.com\">http://www.reachhomeschool.com</a>&gt; www.reachhomeschool.com<br/>\n<br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art!     &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artkunst23.com/\">http://www.artkunst23.com/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artkunst23.com\">http://www.artkunst23.com</a><br/>\n&quot;Know where to find the information and how to use it - That&#39;s the secret of<br/>\nsuccess.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955)<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of thetaberskifamily<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 01, 2005 12:27 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] More confused...<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have just finished reading some posts on another unschooling list - <br/>\nChristian Unschooling - and there is a totally different tone there.  <br/>\nThen there&#39;s Radical Christian Unschooling - a little bit more like <br/>\nwhat you all seem to be talking about here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there unschooling and then....radical unschooling, christian <br/>\nunschooling, radical christian unschooling, etc.?

She is a great mom and  unschooler.  <br/>\nShe set up that site for people like her, that people didn&#39;t  have to follow <br/>\ncertain curriculums and spank to be Christian.<br/>\n <br/>\nI asked you this when you first started posting and I&#39;ll ask again.   Does it <br/>\nmatter what you call yourself?  You may prefer to make up your own  name <br/>\nbased on what you feel highlights what you do.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I attended LaLecheLeague, they used to say &quot;Take what you need and  <br/>\nleave the rest here.&quot;  That is what these lists are for.  You have  brought up <br/>\nsome points, we have given our opinion and encouraged you to take  your thinking <br/>\nfurther.  If you are fine with your thinking, that is  fine!  But if you ask a <br/>\nquestion, you will get a passionate response!<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I first went to LLL, I thought I would never nurse passed a certain  age <br/>\nor do that weird thing they were talking about.....homeschooling!  I  would <br/>\nsit quietly during those discussions and think to myself &quot;these people are  <br/>\ncrazy&quot;.  But when I came up on those very forks in the road, I was SO  grateful <br/>\nto have learned about these ideas because they ended up being exactly  what was <br/>\nright for my children.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo what are you?  A great mom who is passionate about her  children?  I think <br/>\nso, that comes across.  An unschooler, I think  so.  I&#39;m not sure you are <br/>\ninterested in challenging other bits of your  parenting right now.....if that&#39;s <br/>\ntrue, that&#39;s OK!!  But you may want to  hang out here and continue to see what <br/>\nothers that have been down that road are  doing.  Just like my experience with <br/>\nLLL, those ideas that didn&#39;t mean much  at the time ended up being really <br/>\nuseful.  In fact, they changed our  lives.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":234817443,"authorName":"thetaberskifamily","from":"&quot;thetaberskifamily&quot; &lt;thetaberskifamily@...&gt;","profile":"thetaberskifamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"More confused...","postDate":"1130822796","msgId":7351,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrNnVhYytwY2JtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7360,"prevInTime":7350,"nextInTime":7352,"topicId":7351,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have just finished reading some posts on another unschooling list - Christian Unschooling - and there is a totally different tone there.

Is it up to each individual family <br/>\nhow or whether or not they implement it beyond interest-led learning <br/>\nand into parenting/discipline?
