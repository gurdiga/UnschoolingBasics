I periodically offer my daughter (10) comments about things like punctuation, and will even go through, with her permission, and punctuate a piece of her writing so that it&#39;s easier for me to read - she Wants her work to be readable! but I don&#39;t make a big deal about it, and I drop the subject if she seems to be getting annoyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when she writes she&#39;s really conscious of using punctuation, other times she&#39;s more interested in getting all the stuff down in print. She understands about drafts and editing - she does similar things when she draws, sketching in a rough form and then going over it darker when she&#39;s found lines she likes. She has also seen me write and draw, and I&#39;ve talked with her a little about the fact that revising is something writers and artists do regularly - so she doesn&#39;t get hung up thinking something is &quot;wrong&quot;. But like I said, sometimes she doesn&#39;t want any kind of &quot;this would help&quot; feedback - she just wants me to read it and smile. Usually, that happens when she&#39;s still working on a draft, but not always, so I try to offer any comments with a lot of attention to her reaction so I can stop if that&#39;s not helpful to her in the moment. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":490338839,"authorName":"Tina M","from":"&quot;Tina M&quot; &lt;tmcadams81670@...&gt;","profile":"tinamc81670","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"I&#39;m pretty sure I know what the answer is, but I&#39;m going to ask it anyway...","postDate":"1334855718","msgId":48366,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGptcGg3NiticGhmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48367,"prevInTime":48365,"nextInTime":48367,"topicId":48366,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello fellow travelers, Okay, so my daughter (11) is a prolific writer.
