Just wondering...<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know whether this was aimed at me or not; but I think I did <br/>\nwrite that, if I had it to do over again, I would have gotten a PS2 for <br/>\nmy then five year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore little kid-friendly. LOTS more games that he would have liked. At <br/>\nthe time, the Xbox was brand new, and the games were all adult games <br/>\nthat he didn&#39;t like. The PS2 had all the *cool* games that he wanted. <br/>\nAt the time, I didn&#39;t understand all the ins and outs of gaming and the <br/>\ndifferent systems. &lt;G&gt; All the adults I spoke with LOVED the Xbox. But <br/>\n*they* didn&#39;t play little kid games on it!<br/>\n<br/>\nPS2 had/has lots and lots of great games for littluns.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a bunch of systems now---I think all but the old Nintendo and <br/>\nthe new PS3. But everything in the middle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll also second the subscription to Gamefly. Being able to try the <br/>\ngames first saves us big bucks in the long run. Some of the games <br/>\nDuncan would buy would be &quot;done&quot; in an afternoon. Renting them for <br/>\nweeks at a time keeps a steady stream of new and fun games in the house <br/>\nall the time. If he likes them, he can buy the Gamefly one he has or go <br/>\ndown to Game Crazy. If it&#39;s too easy or too hard or just not what he <br/>\nwants, we can shove it right back into its envelope and order a new <br/>\none.

The Nintendo systems have more kid-recommended games (at least in my experience) than the ps or xbox.  My 14 yo is starting to want a different system, though.  The games I&#39;ve seen them enjoy by age 5 were:  Animal Crossing,  Harvest Moon - both versions(with some reading help), Billy Hatcher,  Super Mario Sunshine and Paper Mario.  These games were available at pawn shops or ebay for about $10 to $20.    Oh, also Donkey Kong games and enhanced Pac Man.  Lots of fun.  Cameron  <br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Zoa Conner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zoaconner@...\">zoaconner@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 6, 2008 4:25:50 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Good xbox games for 5 year old<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand what you mean.
