I lived in the Albany Free School community for a decade, and many of the kids who were there for the duration are now adults with their own lives- successfull and happy.  Most transitioned into the local public high school (they just started a Free school high school this year) with little issue academically, and adjusted well to authoritarianism as well LOL! and the ones I hear about have achieved their goals in life thus far, including colleges for many. It isn&#39;t perfect- it won&#39;t ever be, and many parents along the way pulled their kids before the program was completed when they got scared. But that doesn&#39;t mean the model doesn&#39;t work- just that it isn&#39;t right for every family.<br/>\ncarrie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180097986,"authorName":"Ellen","from":"&quot;Ellen&quot; &lt;ellen@...&gt;","profile":"livnsimply","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: democratic schools like Summerhill and Sudbury","postDate":"1166477602","msgId":19886,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVtNzFmMitnZ25sQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYxMjE2MTcxODQ3LjU1NTcwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjU4NTA1Lm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":19829,"nextInTopic":19902,"prevInTime":19885,"nextInTime":19887,"topicId":19809,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I second what Ren said that he is likely referring to the attempt at open class rooms that did not work out well in public schools.

S. Neill founded Summerhill with the belief that<br/>\n&quot;the function of a child is to live his own life � not the life that his<br/>\nanxious parents think he should live, not a life according to the purpose of an<br/>\neducator who thinks he knows best.&quot; This seems very much in line with Holt<br/>\nand unschooling. Those of you who have read Holt, does he say anything about Neill<br/>\nand Summerhill?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking further, I found the Sudbury Valley Schools, in the US and other<br/>\nplaces.

And it&#39;s the job of adults to expose them to models and information,<br/>\nanswer questions�then get out of the way without trampling motivation. There<br/>\nare no classrooms per se, although students can request instruction on any<br/>\nsubject or talk to any staffer any time about an interest. There aren&#39;t even<br/>\ngrades.
