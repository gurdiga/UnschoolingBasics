Boy has that brought back memories. All good ones. And if you really want confirmation that the gentle way of raising kids is a good one, spend some time looking at older unschoolers interacting with little ones. My kids make me so proud. They are amazingly sweet and gentle with these kids. And they are amazingly helpful to me. All of my patience is coming back to me one hunded times over.
