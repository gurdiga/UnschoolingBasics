The woman got really uptight and told my husband<br/>\nthat they don&#39;t  believe in telling their children &quot;no&quot;. He then said<br/>\nthat she went on a  little about self directed learning, and used some<br/>\nof the words I use  (shows you how much men sometimes  listen).&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well....it shows a lack of  respect for a public place in my opinion,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to expect the whole world to have  their same values. If she thinks<br/>\neveryone in the world is open to the idea  of letting kids be right<br/>\nthere while they work, she&#39;s sadly mistaken. Yeah,  it would be great,<br/>\nbut we&#39;re talking about a business,not a private  residence. He DOES<br/>\nhave to consider liabilty  issues.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIn this situation I think the mother could have done more to facilitate  the <br/>\nchildren&#39;s experience.  If they were really interested in cars and how  they <br/>\nwork she might have been able to ask if he could bring out something small  <br/>\nthat the children could look at.  Or she could have asked around if anyone  there <br/>\nworks on their cars at home.  Might have been able to take the  children to <br/>\nsee someone working on cars *outside* the shop environment.  I  know a couple <br/>\nof dads here that have *cars* as a hobby and are usually working  on them in <br/>\nthe backyard at some point during the week.   I am sure  there are more <br/>\nsolutions as well.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think there are more answers than just yes or  no.  There is that place <br/>\nwhere you can say *the law says that you can&#39;t go  in the shop where these people <br/>\nare working on the cars..but lets talk about what  it is you are wanting to <br/>\nsee or do and find another way to work it out so you  get to do it*.  <br/>\n <br/>\nJust my thoughts,<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17208,"nextTopicId":17234}}
