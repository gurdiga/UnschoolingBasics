I&#39;ve seen it in both of my<br/>\ndaughters at that age and by the time they were 10-is to 11-ish they<br/>\nhad pretty much moved beyond that point.  One of the things that I do,<br/>\nthough, is to play for fun myself.  To show my children that I<br/>\n*really* don&#39;t play to win, but just for fun.  Bowling was a big issue<br/>\nin our house.  Mary Elayne never wanted to bowl because she felt she<br/>\nsucked at it.  We started going to a bowling alley that would allow us<br/>\nto put the bumpers up.  She went from the Goddess of the Gutter to<br/>\n&quot;hey, I *can* play this game.&quot;  Now, even though she still uses the<br/>\nbumpers, she really doesn&#39;t need them.  We also started a &quot;you suck<br/>\nclub.&quot;  (Please realize that this was something that my kids started<br/>\nand we do it all in jest and fun - not as a slander - I guess you<br/>\nwould have to be here to see the humor in it.)  Only people who bowled<br/>\nunder 75 or went bancrupt at Monopoly or had 8 children in the game of<br/>\nLife or any numerous other ways was permitted in the &quot;you suck club&quot;<br/>\nSo for a while we were all playing to lose, which was really quite<br/>\nfun.  For a while we were seeing just how many times we could lose big<br/>\ntime at Uno and other games.  Once we took the winning factor out of<br/>\nthe equation attitudes about winning changed.  Sort of a lightbulb<br/>\nthat was blinking, &quot;Yes you can play just for fun.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course it is pretty funny to see us leaving the bowling alley<br/>\nchanting &quot;We suck we suck we suck&quot; and laughing about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205212236,"authorName":"Cara","from":"&quot;Cara&quot; &lt;casonnier@...&gt;","profile":"casonnier","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: How to approach &#39;perfectionism&#39;","postDate":"1163691353","msgId":18961,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVqaTBncCthb3BoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVqZ2hibitucnViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18942,"nextInTopic":18966,"prevInTime":18960,"nextInTime":18962,"topicId":18937,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
