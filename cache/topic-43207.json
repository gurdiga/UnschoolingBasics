The kids choose all the activities and elect their own officers and the parents help provide materials and help where needed. There are tons of projects you can do so its not just for farm kids anymore. My girls are doing cats, photography, cooking, arts and crafts and entomology(I think that is what its called. Its all about bugs) Their year starts in October but as a homeschooler it would probably not be hard for her to catch up with the projects she wants to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also have great &quot;curriculum&quot; that go along with the projects to help us parents with ideas to suggest and things to do. They do have some loose requirements specific to each project for getting into the fair and getting paid at the end of the year (yes the kids earn money)and getting your yearly pins which I have not quite figured out but if you do not fulfill the requirements you can still be in 4-h and participate. We have one child in our group this year who did not meet all requirements from last year and other then not getting the pin at one get together you wouldn&#39;t know it.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":242168979,"authorName":"eintob, d.a.","from":"&quot;eintob, d.a.&quot; &lt;michelle_bailey@...&gt;","profile":"draconi_ann","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: 6 Yr Old/Girl Scouts","postDate":"1266593433","msgId":43212,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhsbWFxcCthdm4xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwOGQwMWNhYjBkNSQwMzNmNDA4MCQwOWJkYzE4MCRAY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43207,"nextInTopic":43213,"prevInTime":43211,"nextInTime":43213,"topicId":43207,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 9yo daughter is in a homeschoolers GS troop that combines juniors with cadettes.
