It&#39;s a great way <br/>\nfor them to learn.  It encourages reading, strategic thought, <br/>\nplanning and, best of all, gets them interacting with friends and <br/>\noff the PlayStation.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo get started there are &quot;Starter Sets&quot; that have a basic guide for <br/>\nthe Game Master (A Dungeon Master&#39;s guide or DM&#39;s guide), a Players <br/>\nGuide (PH or Players Handbook) and they usually include dice and a <br/>\nscenario.  Many players these days use maps and expand the hobby <br/>\ninto painting of miniatures.  This is great hand-eye coordination, <br/>\nby the way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only concern with buying a Starter Set for older kids (13+) is <br/>\nthat they will quickly want the full versions of the books.  So just <br/>\nbuy the Dm&#39;s Guide and PH books and some dice and let &#39;em at it.  <br/>\nPackaged adventures are numerous and quality companies include TSR <br/>\n(Wizards of the Coast) and White Wolf (Sword & Sorcery line).  Check <br/>\nout rpg.net for reviews and they have an online store, as well.  <br/>\nHowever, there are many etailers with 30% off as a standard pricing <br/>\nfor supplements.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nice thing about the latest generation of D&D is that it has a <br/>\nstandard &quot;play engine.&quot;  Which means once you learn the &quot;D20&quot; rules, <br/>\nyou can play in any environment.  There are books for sci fi, <br/>\nfantasy, and tv shows that all use the same &quot;engine.&quot;  So the game <br/>\nitself is flexible and already has a ton of options for players.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is probably a hobby shop in your area that carries the games <br/>\nand they may even have a game room or at least a bulletin board so <br/>\nyou can find other players.  I always advise parents to keep them in <br/>\nthe same age group if you can.  Some &quot;older&quot; players (both in years <br/>\nand in play experience) don&#39;t always cater and take the time to let <br/>\nthe new players explore and learn the nuances of the game.  Once <br/>\nthey&#39;re hooked, though, there are conventions all over the US.  The <br/>\nlargest is GenCon held in Indianapolis usually in August.  <br/>\n(Wizards.com for more info)  There is also a nationally recognized <br/>\nplay system called &quot;Living Greyhawk&quot; which allows players to rank <br/>\nand when they follow this set of rules, they can take the characters <br/>\nthey create to play at the national tournaments and score prizes.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably more than you wanted to know, but there you are!<br/>\nGood Luck and Happy Gaming!<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela:)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"D&D","postDate":"1136751863","msgId":8873,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRwcnNkbituNDRvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8872,"nextInTopic":8874,"prevInTime":8872,"nextInTime":8874,"topicId":8865,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One day we may get around to learning the real rules of D&D (most likely when my D&D guru DH gets back from Iraq), but for now we are having such fun with","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-741392998\">&quot;One day we may get around to learning the &quot;real&quot; rules of D&D (most<br/>\nlikely when<br/>\nmy D&D guru DH gets back from Iraq), but for now we are having such<br/>\nfun with our<br/>\nown rules. :o)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat might be a good way to start with a younger child too.

It arrived a few nights ago, and it hasn&#39;t left Tristan&#39;s sight!  It contained the basic three books that Ren mentioned, and it cost about $55.  We found a large bag of dh&#39;s old dice so have been using those instead of getting new.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt does seem quite complicated, especially for those of us that have never played.  In college I spent many an hour watching friends play but never ended up playing myself.  Yesterday I joked with dh that I need &quot;D&D for Dummies,&quot; only to search on Amazon and discover that there is, indeed, a &quot;D&D for Dummies&quot;! LOL  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night T pulled out the books and decided that we needed to play.  This was strictly &quot;D&D according to Tristan.&quot;  He had me pick two dice that I liked (I think one was a 20-sided and the other a 30-sided), and he started me off on an adventure.  He&#39;s nine, has never played before, and has only flipped though the books, mainly the &quot;Monster Manual.&quot;  He had me wandering around through catacombs....finding chests (sometimes discovering gold or armor, other times finding traps), fighting off various monsters, falling through floors, and having magical creatures (a pegasus and a hippogriff) accompany me.  He had me rolling my dice for attack points, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day we may get around to learning the &quot;real&quot; rules of D&D (most likely when my D&D guru DH gets back from Iraq), but for now we are having such fun with our own rules. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nMalinda<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: kkraczek1969 <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, January 08, 2006 8:24 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: D&D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oh, so it&#39;s not a board game per-se?
