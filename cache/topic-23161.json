It is ideal to give to<br/>\nparents and teachers that must deal with &quot;unruly<br/>\nchildren.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs, Gary<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. A thank you to Shari Snow whose work made this<br/>\nstory possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Ann Adams<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes our very best teachers are the children. The<br/>\nfollowing story is certainly one of those a little<br/>\nchild shall lead them varieties. This seven year old<br/>\nnot only proselytizes for tapping but has also written<br/>\nhis own testimonial. My thanks go to Shari Snow who<br/>\ncurrently volunteers in a school setting in Lexington,<br/>\nNC, for sharing her work with &#39;Brandon&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first day Shari met Brandon she was told he was<br/>\nheaded for a self contained class for students with<br/>\nemotional/behavioral problems. Brandon had experience<br/>\ndifficulty since the day he entered school 2.5 years<br/>\nago. He was considered &quot;at-risk&quot; before entering<br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the current school year there had not been a<br/>\nday that he had not been sent to the principals<br/>\noffice. This day he had just trashed his classroom and<br/>\nwas working on trashing the principals office in<br/>\nanger. He continued to throw things as Shari talked to<br/>\nhim about why he was so mad. When he realized she got<br/>\nit, and stopped a moment to breathe, Shari stretched<br/>\nout her hands and asked him to show how angry he was<br/>\nwith his hands. He stretched them out as far as he<br/>\ncould (indicating maximum anger). [Anns Note: Without<br/>\ngood rapport you get nowhere. The child must see you<br/>\nas different from the other lecturing adults in his or<br/>\nher environment.]<br/>\n<br/>\nShari sat down on the floor in the office and said,<br/>\nThis looks really silly but just do what I am doing.<br/>\nBrandon stopped the tantrum, sat down, and began to<br/>\nfollow the tapping. She tapped with him one round<br/>\nbefore adding a set up statement for the second round:<br/>\n&quot;Even though I am really mad and nobody will listen to<br/>\nme, I am still a really good kid who people should<br/>\nlisten to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo rounds later, when asked how angry he was, Brandon<br/>\nput his hands together (indicating little or no<br/>\nanger). The school counselor watching this<br/>\ntransformation could not believe it. She described it<br/>\nas &quot;watching the anger melt away&quot;. Brandon and Shari<br/>\ntalked some more about the issue that caused the<br/>\noutburst and then, together, they made a plan for the<br/>\nfuture. When it was time for Brandon to return to<br/>\nclass, he asked, Can I tap at home when I get mad<br/>\ntoo? This child understood the power of this process<br/>\nin 5 minutes! He got it quickly and made it a part<br/>\nof his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nShari writes: Brandon is now a seven year old<br/>\nambassador of energy therapies. He is tapping on his<br/>\nown and is showing classmates how to tap. He has<br/>\npeople around him interested and looking for more<br/>\ninformation. He is teaching me lessons on how to get<br/>\nthe message across. He has opened doors I did not<br/>\nexpect to open in the conservative rural community I<br/>\nlive in. This little guy deserves ALL OF THE CREDIT.<br/>\nMe? I got lucky - what a wonderful teacher to learn<br/>\nfrom.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandon has not been back to the principals office.<br/>\nSeveral weeks after the first tapping experience<br/>\nBrandon told Shari he was ready to tell the story for<br/>\nmy friends. In the words of a seven year old, here is<br/>\nBrandons version of using energy therapies.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE TAPPING STUFF<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Brandon (as told to Ms. S)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes the bad stuff not hurt as much.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey look at me funny. But now they know why I do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend got over his dog dying by tapping.<br/>\n<br/>\nI showed him how to help his heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe told his mom to do it and she thought it was<br/>\nstupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him to do it anyways, just not let her see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe made his hands get smaller when Ms. S helped him<br/>\n<br/>\nMs. Lin (the counselor) reminds me to tap when I am<br/>\nmad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can tap in my classroom or ask to go see Ms. Lin.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am teaching Ms. Lin how to tap.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe likes to tap by her nose. I like my forehead.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like school now because I am good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got a treat from the principal for being good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never did that before.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy teachers did not like me because I was bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my teacher likes me now that I am good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that is enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah I do the tapping at home when Nanna yells at<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nShari writes that In six weeks time, this child can<br/>\nsay  I like school now because I am good! His teacher<br/>\ninsists that it is a miracle  I insist it is a very<br/>\npowerful message in the worth of all souls <br/>\nregardless.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat work Shari! And hugs to all the Brandon&#39;s of the<br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn Adams<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

I know a lot where you are coming from, Josh has <br/>\nin the past been very violent, which was a shock coming from a child who always appeared <br/>\nto be very calm and quiet. I would say that we&#39;re very lucky to have the psychologist that <br/>\nwe do. She diagnosed Breanna originally and when Josh was having so many problems, we <br/>\nasked her for help as well. She has been very supportive of us homeschooling, and then <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth is that you do want his behavior to change (in reference to behavioral <br/>\nmodification) , and that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. Hurting people verbally or physically <br/>\nis not okay. What you don&#39;t want is to use a source of power, positive (bribes) or negative  <br/>\n(punishments) to do so. Josh has come a long way with our therapist doing this, and the <br/>\nproblem we had originally was looking at the source. In the end that isn&#39;t  the end-all <br/>\nanswer. It&#39;s helpful to know, yes, it was good for us to know that Josh has an actual wiring <br/>\nproblem in his brain, and it was helpful for OUR processing of the situation, but it didn&#39;t <br/>\nchange him one bit. What did help was Dr M being able to give him the babysteps that he <br/>\nneeded to succeed. We couldn&#39;t just say, you can&#39;t abuse people. We started with, when <br/>\nyou feel the urge to choke your sister come find me right away. We stayed very close, we <br/>\nfound alternatives, we changed our lifestyle to make it easier for him to make the safer <br/>\nchoices. We added a lot of supports. He has a visual wall chart of options. He has my very <br/>\nclose attention. he has a promise from me that BEFORE there is a struggle that I will drop <br/>\neverthing to help him regain control. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps that Josh has his OWN time. I was concerned when you said that you chose to take <br/>\nthe whole family. It might be better to work on the emergency issues right now, some <br/>\nspecific supports for him and let the 7yo have personal time to work on issues. Especially <br/>\nsince the other kids don&#39;t want to go, and he doesn&#39;t want to go, it might be easier to <br/>\ncompromise with him (This is really important for me that we do together, what can I do to <br/>\nmake this okay for you?) Just having time alone with mom may make it a better deal. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck tomorrow. Remember that you aren&#39;t a &#39;patient&#39; you are a consumer.

But coming to a <br/>\npeaceful place in your mind - that is, dealing with your own stress <br/>\nabout it - in the middle of the chaos can help you more clearly see <br/>\nwhat you need to do for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ds and I have had many talks about anger.  He feels so helpless <br/>\nto control his anger when he gets worked up to a rage.  He feels out <br/>\nof control.  But he feels like he should be able to control himself -<br/>\n so he is conflicted and frustrated with himself.  And he even feels <br/>\nlike he is a bad person because of it.  I have pieced this together <br/>\nfrom several little conversations with him about it because he does <br/>\nnot like to talk about it.  Last summer he broke our sliding glass <br/>\ndoor with his heel in a fit of anger.  It was after that that I <br/>\nstarted working on my own stress and anger and fears - writing it <br/>\nall down.  I can&#39;t say that this one thing fixed the problem.  And <br/>\nds still gets extremely angry in certain situations.  But it is no <br/>\nlonger a daily event.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you are able to find a way to work through this.  I just <br/>\ncan&#39;t imagine how TOs and other means of controling would make <br/>\nthings better -- especially if you have already made the switch from <br/>\nTOs to nonmanipulative parenting.  Every time my 8yo is angry with <br/>\nhis brother, it&#39;s because he thinks he should be able to control <br/>\nhim.  And I think it is a direct result of me trying to control him <br/>\nfor the first 6 years of his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, Rachel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, does anyone have any experience with or thoughts for <br/>\n </span></blockquote>approaching the therapist?

Originally I was going to go with <br/>\n&gt; just my 7yo ds, but now I&#39;m planning to take the whole family (dh, 11yo <br/>\n&gt; ds, and 4yo ds).  While 7yo is the one who is chronically irritable <br/>\n&gt; (except for the weeks when he isn&#39;t!), aggressive, and has rages, it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; definitely a whole-family issue at this point.

You&#39;re EVIL!&quot;  Also, I think 11yo&#39;s physical <br/>\n&gt; impulsiveness -- he&#39;s spending a lot of time trying to prove his <br/>\n&gt; &quot;alpha-dog&quot; status -- is often a trigger for 7yo&#39;s aggression toward 4yo. <br/>\n&gt; 11yo&#39;s not &quot;mean&quot; the way 7yo is, but he&#39;s not good at respecting <br/>\n&gt; &quot;stop&quot; -- especially some weeks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;m a little concerned about helping the therapist understand that <br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re not looking for &quot;1-2-3 Magic&quot; or behavior-mod type solutions.  I <br/>\n&gt; want to get to the root of what&#39;s causing their (especially 7yo&#39;s) <br/>\n&gt; frustrations, and figure out how we can help them communicate and meet <br/>\n&gt; their needs better.  At this point, I think we need an outsider <br/>\n&gt; (therapist) and a designated time and place to help do this.  I guess I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; afraid we need help but that the therapist (or the next 7 we try:-) will <br/>\n&gt; pressure us to use time-out (especially for the aggression) or other <br/>\n&gt; &quot;control&quot; methods we aren&#39;t comfortable with.  We did use &quot;time-in&quot; for <br/>\n&gt; the aggression for about 6 weeks last summer.  The aggression got worse, <br/>\n&gt; then improved, then seemed to slowly be increasing again, but I&#39;m not <br/>\n&gt; sure.  It definitely increased when we stopped the &quot;time-ins&quot;.  But we <br/>\n&gt; also were seeing a lot of, &quot;He pinched me, he needs a time-out!&quot; -- child <br/>\n&gt; looking for retribution, that I wasn&#39;t comfortable with either.<br/>\n&gt; (Although, maybe I would be more comfortable with that than the aggression <br/>\n&gt; and irritability we&#39;re seeing now.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh, and my boys aren&#39;t exactly thrilled about this appointment.  11 yo&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; response was a whiny, &quot;I don&#39;t want to...&quot;  And 7yo&#39;s was, &quot;NO.  I&#39;m not <br/>\n&gt; going.  I won&#39;t go.&quot;  I&#39;m sure 4yo&#39;s will echo 7yo&#39;s, but I haven&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; brought it up with him yet.  But this is not a decision I think the boys <br/>\n&gt; are able to make, and having done some phone therapy sessions before, I <br/>\n&gt; also feel that we need a therapist who can actually meet and know the <br/>\n&gt; children, not just dh and myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, does anyone have any experience with or thoughts for approaching <br/>\n&gt; the therapist?

But we also were seeing a lot of, &quot;He pinched me, he needs a time-out!&quot; -- child looking for retribution, that I wasn&#39;t comfortable with either. <br/>\n (Although, maybe I would be more comfortable with that than the aggression and irritability we&#39;re seeing now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and my boys aren&#39;t exactly thrilled about this appointment.  11 yo&#39;s response was a whiny, &quot;I don&#39;t want to...&quot;  And 7yo&#39;s was, &quot;NO.  I&#39;m not going.  I won&#39;t go.&quot;  I&#39;m sure 4yo&#39;s will echo 7yo&#39;s, but I haven&#39;t brought it up with him yet.  But this is not a decision I think the boys are able to make, and having done some phone therapy sessions before, I also feel that we need a therapist who can actually meet and know the children, not just dh and myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, does anyone have any experience with or thoughts for approaching the therapist?  Or, alternatively, are we just crazy?<br/>\n<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
