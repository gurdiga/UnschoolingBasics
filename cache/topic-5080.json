If <br/>\nyou go shopping alone and they don&#39;t ask for anything in particular, <br/>\nthen you&#39;ll probably buy a great variety of foods. If they go with <br/>\nyou and ask for a bag of cookies, you can say yes and *over time* as <br/>\nthey see then can have them whenever they want, they&#39;ll be listening <br/>\nto their bodies, not trying to get all the cookies they can before <br/>\nMom stops them! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they like cookies and you&#39;re uncomfortable with buying bags of <br/>\nhighly processed ones, you can head right for the bakery section and <br/>\nget them each a cookie to eat whie walking around the store! It may <br/>\nsatisfy their cookie craving in a way that you are okay with--or it <br/>\nmay not...that&#39;s the thing about strewing: the kids may or may not go <br/>\nalong with your ideas, but you can certainly put them out there. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the learning from others&#39; mistakes department, here&#39;s what we&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen doing that is NOT going so well...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve let go of almost all food controls. Dh does the grocery shopping <br/>\nand buys TONS of sugary products. He and the kids really have sweet <br/>\nteeth--they love fruit and any form of sugar. I try to put lots of <br/>\nfruits in front of them, but with so many choices of sugrary foods, <br/>\nthey do eat a lot. Then dh is frustrated at what they are eating and <br/>\nstarts saying &quot;no candy until you eat something healthy.&quot; So then <br/>\nthey feel controled and want more sugar just to win the power <br/>\nstruggle with him!<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally got him to skip all the sugary snacks this weekend (we <br/>\nstill have plenty in the house!), but then he went to the convenience <br/>\nstore twice with one or both kids and bought candy, ice cream and <br/>\nEaster candy. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night the kids hardly ate anything at dinner, so I mentioned to <br/>\ndh that they would most likely be hungry in a couple hours. I knew <br/>\nthat if they said they were hungry to him at 8pm, he&#39;d think &quot;it&#39;s <br/>\ndessert time&quot; and only offer desserts. I knew they hadn&#39;t had a lot <br/>\nof protein, fruit or veggies, so I wanted to make sure to offer those-<br/>\n-probably by making a platter of carrots, popsicle peas (yep, also a  <br/>\nfavorite here), an apple, cheese, etc. But I was on the phone...and <br/>\nhe gave them Jello only.

Unfortunately,<br/>\nthe best food takes time to prepare and I don&#39;t want to just give them a<br/>\n&quot;quick fix&quot; and then have them not be hungry and not get the nutritious<br/>\nfood.  I understand this fear may not be well founded, but it is my concern.<br/>\nI did read about an experiment done with a bunch of three-year-olds.  They<br/>\nwere allowed to choose whatever foods they wanted from a pretty broad buffet<br/>\nand they found that the children who had not yet been indoctrinated ate the<br/>\nthings that their bodies needed.  One example they gave was a child with<br/>\nrickets who took CLO all on his own until he was cured.  I *know* that this<br/>\ncan work, I just need time and a little bit of personal success to *believe*<br/>\nit.  Until I truly believe it, my fears will rear their ugly heads and tell<br/>\nme it won&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I saw some mention of it somewhere.  I bemoaned the fact that I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know about it last year when it was in Fitchburg, MA, which is less<br/>\nthan an hour from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudy<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Cheyenne Cain [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cherokeecain@...\">cherokeecain@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, March 15, 2005 10:57 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] mealtime play?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Is it eating together or connecting together at the<br/>\n  dinner table that your looking for.
