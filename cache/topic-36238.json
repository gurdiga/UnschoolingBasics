I used to have it down, firmly and certainly.<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until I read those words, and the post that followed that I<br/>\nrealized it&#39;s faded so much.  Don&#39;t ask me why, I can&#39;t say except that I<br/>\nprobably got out of the &#39;habit&#39; of focusing on the positive, and once you&#39;re<br/>\nin a different rut, you stay there until someone shoves you out.  I do<br/>\nbelieve my tires are on higher ground now! :)  Thanks for the push!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMeredith wrote:<br/>\n  I don&#39;t vent about my kids to friends or extended family -<br/>\nalthough my partner and I vent to each other from time to time.<br/>\n******************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was something else that really stood out to me.  That truth that we are<br/>\nhuman beings and our kids just might cause us a little stress sometimes and<br/>\nit&#39;s ok to vent (to someone safe).  I often feel that because I&#39;m choosing<br/>\nto unschool the boys, I just better shut the hell up and enjoy every second<br/>\nof it, and if I don&#39;t, what&#39;s wrong with me and what am I doing wrong?<br/>\nThen, right back down I go into that deep dark rut, because of my own<br/>\nself-judgements.  Staying in touch with my confidence (even on hard days)<br/>\nand staying positive (even on the hard days) will allow me to get off of my<br/>\nown back.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I love your solution, writing out what&#39;s bugging you, and then editing<br/>\nall those things away.  I&#39;m going to try that!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much for the conversation!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBe Well,<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thewildtribe.blogspot.com\">http://www.thewildtribe.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field.
