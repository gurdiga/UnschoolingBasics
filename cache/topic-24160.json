I actually looked at moving there and decided not too cause of the homeschooling laws.  Cant remeber all of them but it is an easy search on the net.   My parents live there and homeschooled my sister.  They had to use a curriculiam and constantly had to have someone in there...    I cant remember everything.  But I will say they did quit homeschooling and my sis went to the PS system there and she hated it.  It was very clicky and to top it off when she graduated after she had atttended there for 3 years the supertendent mispronounced her name....   Sarai (sara+ i) pretty hard name lol......   We live in Kansas and the laws here are awesome.
