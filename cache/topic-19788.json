As a critical care<br/>\nnurse, it took a lot of research to convince myself of the studies.<br/>\nSo, I came to homebirthing backwards from intuition. I trusted the<br/>\nmedical research! <br/>\n<br/>\nI assume that you are familiar with www.mothering.com You might also<br/>\nenjoy the AlwaysUnschooled yahoogroup with families, from birth and<br/>\nbeyond, who have Always Unschooled. :-)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;d like a smaller list, Healthy Parenting is very alternative<br/>\nalso: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/healthy_parenting/?yguid=287472904\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/healthy_parenting/?yguid=287472904</a><br/>\nIt is focused more on young children, rather than unschooling however.<br/>\nOf course, there are unassisted birth support lists too, as UC is<br/>\nbecoming more and more preferred.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe co-slept from birth. Ds slept within the embrace of my arm. We had<br/>\na toddler bedrail on the bed due to my paranoia, even before he could<br/>\nturn over. LOL But the bed covers were never an issue. The mama will<br/>\nbe very in tune with the baby&#39;s sleep cycles. We actually awaken in<br/>\nour own sleep cycle at about 90 minutes; and babies often wake at<br/>\naround 100 minutes as infants. So, mamas who co-sleep come into a<br/>\nlighter sleep cycle just before babies awaken. We never had any issues<br/>\nwith rolling over, or off the bed, or anything like that either. I&#39;d<br/>\njust rouse around when our son would move or make any sounds. New<br/>\nmamas have heightened hearing at night, I have read. However, dh was<br/>\nless aware in his sleep, so I generally slept in the middle of the<br/>\nbed. You can push the bed against the wall, if you are concerned. Or,<br/>\nplace the mattress and box springs on the floor, as some families do.<br/>\nWe now have a king and twin pushed together. Although, ds sleeps in<br/>\nhis room most nights.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is pleasant to have all the big bed back to move around, as ds<br/>\nliked to snuggle in my half of the king. LOL So, you might consider<br/>\nspending the money on a twin (instead of a co-sleeper), and place the<br/>\nbaby in it next to your all&#39;s bed. Of course, pushed together so that<br/>\nthere is no gap. That makes the transition to sleeping separately<br/>\neasier since there is plenty of room. Oh, I just re-read your note, it<br/>\nappears that you have purchased the co-sleeper already. Hmmm...another<br/>\noption some folks will create a nest on the floor next to the bed for<br/>\nthe baby. We placed the unused crib mattress on the floor for a while<br/>\nbefore we had purchased the twin. That was probably around the time of<br/>\ncrawling. But, it was much easier for me to nurse at the same level<br/>\ninstead of having to get baby or me in and out of bed. The easiest is<br/>\nto co-sleep, imo. And everyone gets more sleep that way, if you have<br/>\nenough space.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo address your question about clothes, it really depends upon the<br/>\nbaby. Our son slept better when warm at night as a baby, or swaddled<br/>\n(highly recommended). But as he got closer to 18 months, he<br/>\nconsistently indicated that he didn&#39;t like covers or clothes at night.<br/>\nAt 5, he is very hot blooded and still likes shorts when I have a<br/>\nsweater and long pants. So, *it depends*. But, yes, the general<br/>\nrecommendation is no covers for infants, as far as I know. As soon as<br/>\nthey can turn their head, they can bat a sheet off of them. Ds was<br/>\nborn in June, so we just used a sheet on the bed and no heavy covers.<br/>\nYou might just turn up the heat and do similarly.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes, Pat</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":282107434,"authorName":"Chris","from":"&quot;Chris&quot; &lt;chris@...&gt;","profile":"thegoodlife_73","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Unassisted Home Birth  (WAS: Arm&#39;s Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet)","postDate":"1166318522","msgId":19825,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVtMjYzcSt2N2dqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUxNDgzNy4zMDk1Ni5xbUB3ZWI1MzIwOS5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":19807,"nextInTopic":19833,"prevInTime":19824,"nextInTime":19826,"topicId":19788,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Mara and Tom, Thanks so much for the insight (as well as the Dad s lists which I just subscribed to)!

Does this mean that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we shouldn&#39;t have any other sheets/blankets, so<br/>\n&gt; our child just sleeps in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whatever clothes it has on?

What <br/>\nwould you do, he would ask them, if the world had become more or less <br/>\nthe kind of place you want it to be; how would you live, how would you <br/>\ntreat other people? Live that way now, treat them that way now. If <br/>\nsomething prevents you, try to find a way to deal with that. We can <br/>\nbegin to treat children, even the youngest and smallest, wherever we <br/>\nmay find them, as we would want everyone to treat them in the society <br/>\nwe are trying to make.<br/>\nWe can begin by trying to be courteous to them. This will be very <br/>\ndifficult for those who have been taught by experience only to be <br/>\nservile to the strong and rude and bossy toward the weak or those who <br/>\nhave learned to think of children as love objects and to treat them as <br/>\nthey would a favorite dog or cat. For to be courteous we must first of <br/>\nall respect the other person’s dignity and sense of self. We must treat <br/>\nhim with a certain formality and reserve until we find out how he would <br/>\nlike to be treated. We must respect not just his physical but his <br/>\nemotional life space until he shows us how far into that space he is <br/>\nready to welcome us. And though being courteous means much more than <br/>\nmerely being polite, it means at least that. So we must try to learn to <br/>\nsay &quot;Please&quot; or &quot;Excuse Me&quot; or &quot;Thank You&quot; to children, and in the same <br/>\ntone of voice we would use to anyone else. We must not treat a child <br/>\nlike a servant and demand from him favors or services that we would not <br/>\nthink of asking of someone our own age. Indeed, because he is new in <br/>\nthis world, and gets his sense of it from how we be- have toward him, <br/>\nwe would do well to show him extra courtesy like the wise parents who <br/>\nsaid to me once that most of the time they tried to behave toward their <br/>\nthen four-year-old son as if he were a very distinguished visitor from <br/>\na strange and alien civilization, knowing little but eager to learn <br/>\nabout how we do things here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother small way to be courteous is by respecting and protecting the <br/>\nchild’s right to privacy. Until the law gives to him as it does to us <br/>\n(at least on paper) the right to be free from arbitrary search and <br/>\nseizure, we should act as if he had that right. This means, among other <br/>\nthings, not going into a child’s room without asking, and receiving, <br/>\npermission. Many children’s rooms have signs saying, &quot;Keep Out!,&quot; <br/>\n&quot;Danger,&quot; &quot;Absolutely Private,&quot; and the like. This fierceness may amuse <br/>\nus but it may well be a child’s desperate clutch at a privacy and <br/>\ndignity he has never had and does not expect to get. Many children who <br/>\nput up such signs know that they won’t be respected, that &quot;their&quot; room <br/>\nis as open to other people as any room in their house.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd privacy means privacy of thought as well as space. Too many people <br/>\nthink they have a right and duty to know almost everything their child <br/>\nis doing or even thinking. They ask, &quot;What did you do in school today?&quot; <br/>\nto which the child very often replies, &quot;Nothing.&quot; He only means, <br/>\n&quot;Nothing that I want to talk about.&quot; Or perhaps, &quot;Nothing that I want <br/>\n(or dare) talk to you about – at least right now.&quot; People who really <br/>\nlike hearing what their children have been doing don’t usually have to <br/>\nask them.<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.

The warnings about co-sleeping are enormously inflated<br/>\nand based on people leaving babies alone in adult beds or sleeping with them<br/>\nwhile under the influence. To answer your questions more specifically:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Fitted sheets: We simply used newborn-sized blankets and tucked them<br/>\naround the sheet so there was no slack. It is important that there aren&#39;t<br/>\nloose  sheets, but a tiny bit of give is inevitable. Just make sure the baby<br/>\nis on his or her back to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. We found that by three months, our fears about the bed were soothed to<br/>\nthe point where we did as most of the world does and simply brought her in<br/>\nwith us, making sure there were no pillows or blankets around her face.<br/>\nShe&#39;s 1.5 now and happily acrobating around the family bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that said, it attaches so nicely that if your baby is a sort who doesn&#39;t<br/>\nrequire physical contact to feel comfortable at night -- and it seems there<br/>\nare many babies who prefer it that way -- it should work for you. Ours likes<br/>\nto cuddle so we outgrew it quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Tom C.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 12/15/06, Chris Cade &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chris@...\">chris@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hello all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Long time lurker, first time poster.
