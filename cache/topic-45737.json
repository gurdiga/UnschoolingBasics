Admire your child. You will be amazed. Learn to be content with your own puzzlement, and to nurture the puzzlement around you. It&#39;s okay not to have all the answers, but to let the questions confuse you for a while as you move in new directions. Let new ideas and experiences astonish you. Find delight in small, everyday things.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurn and softly look at the world to see what is fresh and new. Look at the world with awe. See the world with curiosity. Admire the world. You will be amazed.<br/>\n<br/>\n ---Sandra Dodd<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/\">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45676,"nextTopicId":45752}}
