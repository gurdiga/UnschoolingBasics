With my husband gone I felt very alone in this<br/>\nsituation. Talking with you all helped me to forget my anger and focus on<br/>\nhelping him. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it turned out to be somewhat of a different issue than what I was<br/>\nafraid it was. One of the things I had said to him during on of our earlier<br/>\ntalks was that I felt that sex is a wonderful, beautiful, special thing<br/>\nshared between two consenting adults that love and care about each other.<br/>\nWell, night before last when we were leaving to go get dinner he was asking<br/>\nme questions about his conception. I told him that his dad and I had gone on<br/>\na very romantic camping trip around the time that I became pregnant and I<br/>\nliked to think that that was when he was conceived. Didn&#39;t seem terrible to<br/>\nme which it&#39;s probably why I missed the reason he was upset. Well, yesterday<br/>\nwhen I went to speak to him he just went off. How could I do something like<br/>\nhave sex in a tent when I was the one who had told him that sex was supposed<br/>\nto be special and beautiful? How could I stoop so low? If sex is supposed to<br/>\nbe special it should only be done in a bed and that doing it anywhere else<br/>\nwas despicable and disgusting. He just kept saying, How could you stoop so<br/>\nlow? That it was because of me that he had so much respect for women and<br/>\nthat I must have no respect for myself to do that. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked for several hours. He said that it was okay if his dad and I had<br/>\nsex (gee, thanks. lol) but he wanted me to promise that from now on we would<br/>\nonly do it our bed. I was kind of stunned and didn&#39;t really know what to say<br/>\nor how to explain it so that he could understand, though I did try. I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure that it&#39;s necessary to try to explain it at length at this point. I<br/>\nreally didn&#39;t even know how to explain it. I was thinking that when he got<br/>\nolder it might make more sense to him and best to just leave it alone for<br/>\nnow. We talked and listened and made peace, even though I refused to promise<br/>\nwhat he asked. I still wish that I was able to explain it better to him but<br/>\nI am glad that he regards sex with respect. I just feel as though I may not<br/>\nhave provided him with a piece to the puzzle. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. We did talk about his treatment of me also.
