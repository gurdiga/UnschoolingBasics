It&#39;s partly a fear issue and partly <br/>\nan issue of not wanting the other kids in the neighborhood to see her learn how <br/>\nto ride for the first time.  She&#39;s worried that they&#39;ll mock her, and they <br/>\nprobably would.  But it does bug her to some extent that her younger brothers <br/>\nboth ride.  So I told her that once school starts up again and the neighborhood <br/>\nkids are back in school, I will work with her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think for a long time it bothered me more than it did her -- you know, the <br/>\nwhole thing of &quot;well, she&#39;s ____ years old and should be able to _____ by now.&quot;  <br/>\nBut then I looked back at the attitude that my husband and I took with our kids <br/>\nwhen they were little -- as long as we knew they were healthy, we let them <br/>\ndecide when they were ready to take a particular step (toilet-training, for <br/>\ninstance).  Somehow, I stopped thinking that way as they grew older and fell <br/>\ninto the habit of comparing them to their peers.  Why should I push my daughter <br/>\nto ride a bike at a certain age any more than I pushed her to go on the potty at <br/>\na certain age?

When he was interested, we&#39;d put him<br/>\nand the bike into the car and come here to where I work (10 minute<br/>\ndrive) and he&#39;d have the whole parking lot to ride around in. Then, we<br/>\ntook the bike over to MIL&#39;s house because she lived on a small, very<br/>\nquiet street with sidewalks, much more conducive to bike riding.<br/>\nHowever, that was a 25-30 minute drive away. We were willing but he lost<br/>\ninterest when other things took precedence in his days (Pokemon<br/>\nparticularly).  So, he&#39;s a 12 yr old who has no interest in riding a<br/>\nbike (and he has no diagnosis of anything).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as swimming, he can swim now - it&#39;s been about 2-3 years that he<br/>\ncould confidently swim on his own. Mostly his learning consisted of<br/>\npaddling about near the boat launch in his life vest while DH and I were<br/>\nloading and unloading the canoe. He has a similar body type to my<br/>\nbrother - all muscle, not a lot of fat, zero buoyancy. So, even resting<br/>\non my arms and trying to float was tense for him. The life vest provided<br/>\nthe buoyancy so he could focus on the rest of the kicking and stroking<br/>\nmotions. Once he had that figured out, he could keep himself above<br/>\nwater. He still doesn&#39;t like getting water in his face, so water slides<br/>\nand such are right out. I totally understand that - I have to have a<br/>\ntowel over the shower rod so I can wipe water out of my face<br/>\nimmediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust saying that some folks (with or without physical issues) may not<br/>\nfind bike rides or water slides enjoyable no matter what. So, the TV<br/>\ncommercial &quot;ideal&quot; of family bike rides or water park &#39;staycations&#39; may<br/>\nnot be something that happens with your family. Rather than focusing on<br/>\nwhat is not happening, what he can&#39;t do, what does he love? What makes<br/>\nhim a unique and wonderful person? How can that be worked into the<br/>\nfamily&#39;s time? If he loves animated movies, have family movie nights,<br/>\nfor example. And maybe have one adult or the other and sibling go bike<br/>\nriding some other time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

It&#39;s partly a fear issue and partly an issue of not wanting the other kids in the neighborhood to see her learn how to ride for the first time.  She&#39;s worried that they&#39;ll mock her, and they probably would.  But it does bug her to some extent that her younger brothers both ride.

Somehow, I stopped thinking that way as they grew older and fell into the habit of comparing them to their peers.  Why should I push my daughter to ride a bike at a certain age any more than I pushed her to go on the potty at a certain age?

It has never stopped me from being able to enjoy water. I just stay out of the deep end unless I have a flotation device or life jacket. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;The problem I had is that his 6 year old brother can do these things, so besides being an embarassment for my 9yo.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is this something that your 9 yo has pointed out or is this an observation on your part? Has your 9 year old stated that he is embarrassed? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;It was also hard for the rest of us who want to do these activities and my 9yo can&#39;t or won&#39;t go. I actually got him riding by doing a special camp for kids with disabilities and then after another month of working with him, he can ride. Unfortunately, he does not have the confidence in himself (he&#39;s had some bad wrecks), so he won&#39;t ride with the family.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t he get a bike with training wheels? There are a lot of cool training wheels that can be put on a bike of just about any size. What about walking or running along side while everyone else bikes? What about a scooter or some other type of wheeled toy that he can ride that doesn&#39;t require the kind of balance and coordination that a regular 2 wheel bike requires. It seems like the focus is on him riding a 2 wheeled bike like his brother rather than finding a way to be with the family that your 9 year old is comfortable with. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt;With both of these activities, I see that fear is holding him back. I know he would love the independence of being able to ride to the store with his older sister without me if he could ride his bike confidently.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What is wrong with being afraid of something that you know you can&#39;t do? Are you afraid of anything? I am afraid of heights so that keeps me from climbing on roofs. Part of the reason that I am afraid of heights is because I get really bad vertigo. As a kid, there was no way to explain vertigo so to others is just looked like a fear of heights. Is he truly afraid or is that he just doesn&#39;t have the desire? There are things that I can&#39;t/won&#39;t do because they aren&#39;t important to me. Somebody that doesn&#39;t live inside my head might say that I am afraid to do it. Are there other ways for your son to feel independent? Why can&#39;t they walk to the store together? Has he said that he wants to ride with his sister or is that an assumption on your part? It can be really hard to keep from projecting my feelings onto my children. Just because I think my children would like something doesn&#39;t mean that they actually would like it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I also know he would love the waterslides at our soon to be ex-city pool if he was comfortable in the water.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can he wear a life jacket to use the waterslides? It seems like you are of the mind that the only way he can be in the water and enjoy it is if he can swim. If he isn&#39;t comfortable in the water, then don&#39;t push it. Why can&#39;t he sit on the side of the pool and watch everyone else play? We have a little 3 foot pool in our back yard. Last year, my then 2 year old wasn&#39;t comfortable in it. This year, she loves it and is like a little fish. I never pushed it on her. I gave her floaties. I played with her in the water and I never made a big deal out of whether or not she could swim or hold her breath underwater. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt;He won&#39;t really talk about his fears either. He just pretends that it doesn&#39;t bother him that he can&#39;t do all this stuff. Can anyone give me some feedback on this situation?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do you know he is pretending? Has he said or done anything to indicate that it really does bother him? Why would he talk about his fears? He probably feels that it doesn&#39;t matter what he says because you have already made up your mind that his only option is to learn to swim and bike. It may not really be that way but that could be the way he feels based on what you have said here. There seems to be a lot of comparison between what your 9 year old and your 6 year old can do. Even if your 9 year old didn&#39;t have a disability, there is a chance that he wouldn&#39;t be able to do some of those things. Try not to project your fears and desires onto your children. That can be hard but it is worth it. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG - www.avg.com <br/>\nVersion: 9.0.851 / Virus Database: 271.1.1/3065 - Release Date: 08/11/10 13:34:00<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: balancing family needs with child&#39;s needs and dealing with fear","postDate":"1281635397","msgId":44634,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk0MWM4NStsMHJtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGkzdm9xMysxcDlwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44626,"nextInTopic":44638,"prevInTime":44633,"nextInTime":44635,"topicId":44626,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************* My dd will be 9 in a few days and can t ride a bike - she doesn t have cp or any other physical issues, its just not something she can do,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2080547630\">&quot;Toby&quot; &lt;philipntoby@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;ve let him go at his own pace.

Part of the problem is that our road is on a little bit of a slope and going down-hill unnerves her. <br/>\n<br/>\nRay was barrelling down the same road by age 6 (riding a bike sooner, but we lived higher up the same hill and he&#39;d careen down at maximum speed... wheeeeee!) with no fear at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts easy to forget, or be oblivious to how unsettling some sensations can be to some people. You&#39;re putting emphasis on these things because your son has cp, thinking maybe this is something you can teach him to overcome and that doing so will be good for him. But pushing someone to overcome fear can backfire in big ways, setting that person up to continually second-guess his or her own reactions - and second-guessing will get in the way of learning. It doesn&#39;t create the atmosphere of confidence that lets people keep trying in the face of failure. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;It was also hard for the rest of us who want to do these activities and my 9yo can&#39;t or won&#39;t go.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past I also had fond fantasies of family bike-rides. It doesn&#39;t do your child any good to hold those kinds of fantasies, though. They&#39;ll prevent you from seeing your real child. Instead of family bike-rides, Mo comes to yoga class with me and George, and then we go out to breakfast. Instead of family bike-rides, we have family star-gazing nights and owl-listening nights (we have an owl living in our back yard!). Instead of family bike-rides we have afternoons spent watching movies together. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son really wants to come on these rides, though, find a way to make that happen. Honor his fear, rather than trying to shove him past it, and find a Safe solution that works for him. Get a recumbent bike, maybe, or some other kind of bike modified for people with disabilities. If you (anyone) live in the state of Washinging, check out the group &quot;Outdoors For All&quot; to test drive some of their bikes and go on some of their rides. Its great fun! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; He can swim in the shallow but he&#39;s afraid of the deep end.

Let him use floats. Get him a mask and snorkel and see if those appeal. Mo will go into much deeper water with a mask and snorkel bc she&#39;s more comfortable snorkling than any other kind of swimming. If its a public pool, talk to the management and throw the words &quot;special needs&quot; at them if necessary. Its what the lable is good for. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I understand  allowing a child to go at his own pace, but now I&#39;ve reached a point where if I don&#39;t help him push past his fear he will create a smaller world for himself.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking that The solution to fear is pushing past it is what creates the smaller world - it doesn&#39;t help a person really think about allllllll the options that exist. You&#39;re stuck in the small world of fear-vs-overcoming and its blinding you to a hundred other possibilities. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294879737,"authorName":"Toby","from":"&quot;Toby&quot; &lt;philipntoby@...&gt;","profile":"philipntoby@sbcglobal.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"balancing family needs with child&#39;s needs and dealing with fear","postDate":"1281582723","msgId":44626,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkzdm9xMysxcDlwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44634,"prevInTime":44625,"nextInTime":44627,"topicId":44626,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 9yo son has mild cp (he can walk but can t run and jump well and because his muscles are stiff has a hard time coordinating most typical kids skills). He","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-148927903\">My 9yo son has mild cp (he can walk but can&#39;t run and jump well and because his muscles are stiff has a hard time coordinating most typical kids skills). He started therapy at 2 because he wasn&#39;t walking, but in the last couple of years as therapy has tapered off, I&#39;ve let him go at his own pace. This summer though he was still not riding his bike or able to swim. The problem I had is that his 6 year old brother can do these things, so besides being an embarassment for my 9yo. It was also hard for the rest of us who want to do these activities and my 9yo can&#39;t or won&#39;t go. I actually got him riding by doing a special camp for kids with disabilities and then after another month of working with him, he can ride. Unfortunately, he does not have the confidence in himself (he&#39;s had some bad wrecks), so he won&#39;t ride with the family. I&#39;ve also recently started swimming with him. He can swim in the shallow but he&#39;s afraid of the deep end. At least with swimming, he&#39;s more interested when we go to the pool. With both of these activities, I see that fear is holding him back. I know he would love the independence of being able to ride to the store with his older sister without me if he could ride his bike confidently. I also know he would love the waterslides at our soon to be ex-city pool if he was comfortable in the water. I understand  allowing a child to go at his own pace, but now I&#39;ve reached a point where if I don&#39;t help him push past his fear he will create a smaller world for himself. He won&#39;t really talk about his fears either. He just pretends that it doesn&#39;t bother him that he can&#39;t do all this stuff. Can anyone give me some feedback on this situation? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\ntoby</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44661,"nextTopicId":44633}}
