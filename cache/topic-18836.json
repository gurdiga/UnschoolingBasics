I felt this was not her choice, but rather forced on her by circumstances. But that is possibly due to the nature of schooling and not the Montessori method itself. I pulled her out of that school because of teacher retention problems, and she went to a traditional public school. She actually liked it better having her own desk and knowing that she had her own space.

But she LOVED her career and she was<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  passionate about learning everything she could about child<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  development and learning in young children. That led her to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  eventually earning a masters degree in early childhood education.  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; She<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  got involved in many local organizations related to young children<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  and put in MANY hours over many many years helping parents of young<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  children. She tirelessly protested the &quot;pushing-down&quot; of curriculum<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  and too-early teaching of reading in kindergarten and younger. She<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  worked on campaigns to keep academics out of preschools.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  She ended up running a laboratory preschool where people could learn<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  how to run a developmentally appropriate program which consisted<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  ENTIRELY of free play and which was not a daycare program (the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  children were there for 2 1/2 hours, up to 3 times per week). She<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  created the program at a high school and she directed it for 30<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  years. High school kids and other adults from the community could<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  learn there.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  And, by the way, she made enough money to be able to live well -  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; well<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  enough to travel EVERY summer all over the world - not surprisingly,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  her travels mostly involved visiting early childhood programs in<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Norway, Germany, Spain, Australia and New Zealand, Austria,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Czechoslovakia, England, Ireland, Scotland. She&#39;d also been to  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hawaii<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  and Alaska. She&#39;d taken a train across Canada. When she died, 3  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; years<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  ago, she&#39;d recently returned from a trip to Italy where she&#39;d spent<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  three weeks visiting Reggio schools.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  So - my point is that following your passion EVEN into what are<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  usually low-paying jobs can lead to a wonderful life. Those who are<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  passionate about their work will naturally put the kind of energy<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  into it that allows them to be recognized and to make a good living.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  -pam<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Unschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Live Love Learn<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  UNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

Lots and lots of<br/>\npeople ENJOY desk jobs. I worked a 9-5 kinda job at a desk right out<br/>\nof high school, taking reservations for a big hotel chain. It wasn&#39;t<br/>\nvery much pay, but it was a great way to get out on my own and spread<br/>\nmy wings.

I think very highly of <br/>\nMontessori (have AMI Montessori certification for ages 2 1/2 through <br/>\nage 6 or so and &quot;taught&quot; 3 years).  I see Montessori as self-education <br/>\nwith minimal adult interruption in a beautiful learning laboratory <br/>\ncarefully designed just for the little ones&#39; exploration.  My <br/>\nexperience is that kids like to do a lot more than &quot;play&quot; and that <br/>\nincludes doing &quot;real stuff&quot; by their own free choice.
