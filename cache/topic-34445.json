One of the biggest reasons i <br/>\nfinally made the leap to take Liz (15) out of school was her high <br/>\nlevel of anxiety.  Things got bad enough that I asked her doctor for <br/>\nmedication because the school basically threatened me with <br/>\nprosecuting us for truancy and letting the judge deal with me.   The <br/>\nfirst medication worked for the short term but after a few weeks her <br/>\nbody got used to it and she went back to feeling anxious.  At that <br/>\npoint she became completely unable to cope because once she knew <br/>\nwhat &quot;normal&quot; felt like she felt even worse.  They changed the type <br/>\nof medication to an anti depressant for a better long term effect <br/>\nbut that took two weeks to kick in.  This is when I took her out of <br/>\nschool.  For some reason at teh time it made sense to me to wait <br/>\nuntil after break but because of the med issue we stopped early.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow it is a year and a half later and she has made amazing strides <br/>\ndealing with her anxiety.  By taking one medication every day and <br/>\nhaving another for high stress times (mostly sleeping away fom home) <br/>\nshe has done awesome.  Two years ago she couldn&#39;t sleep away from <br/>\nhome without hyperventilating and throwing up so she had stopped <br/>\ntrying.   This weekend she was invited to go to North Carolina and <br/>\nBusch Gardens with a friend on Sunday so she put a bag together and <br/>\nleft on Monday.  Amazing!  She hasn&#39;t even had to take the special <br/>\nmedicine in about a year.  I think just having it is enough to keep <br/>\nher anxiety down.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my problem is she has decided not to take the anti depressant <br/>\nanymore either and is currently difficult to live with.  She is <br/>\nquicker than usual to blow up and very defensive.
