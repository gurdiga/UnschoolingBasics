Dang, I didn&#39;t see those five pounds piling on but now these jeans are tight. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not just the kids who are deschooling, after all. It&#39;s the parents, too. Most of us had all those years of school and then the expectation that we would school our kids. Then we sent them to school and tried to make that a positive experience, all rah-rah about the whole thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then we have to let ourselves acknowledge that that way didn&#39;t work and maybe, just maybe, we were wrong about something. That maybe we have to think about something we thought we knew the answer to in a completely different way. With resistance and mixed messages all around us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat takes time, longer than we think (like taking those five pounds off) and then we finally have a relaxed day when we are just enjoying life and our kids. Then you have a few of those in a row. Enough to realize what&#39;s happening. Oh, look. The jeans fit again! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The funniest part for me was that I didn&#39;t just wake up one day and say<br/>\n&gt; &quot;ahh, deschooling is over with, we must be really unschooling now.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  Sometime after I stopped thinking about the deschooling process, we we<br/>\n&gt; moved through it.
