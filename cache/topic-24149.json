That temporary kind of lifestyle is very hard <br/>\non children and a lot develop some sort of attachment issues. Do a <br/>\nsearch on it and see if anything applies. You (or her parents) can <br/>\ntake a look at my blog and click the &quot;adoption&quot; label in the sidebar <br/>\nfor more information or e-mail me offlist.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best you can do is listen to her. Do they know if she was abused <br/>\nin any way while in state care? Also, make sure the parents get <br/>\ncopies of the reports from the hospital. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow well did you know this child before this happened? Did you have <br/>\na trusting relationship? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll keep her in my thoughts.
