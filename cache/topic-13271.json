I just couldn&#39;t get over it.  And you all look so, well,<br/>\nnormal.  You don&#39;t have any pink streaks, all the children (aside from<br/>\nTrevor) have their normal color hair and Sierra isn&#39;t wearing one of her<br/>\nhomemade fashions.  I almost didn&#39;t recognize you all!  :-)  The article was<br/>\ngood.  I only skimmed through it quickly at the store, but will sit back and<br/>\nabsorb it later.
