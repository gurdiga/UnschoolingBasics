It started out with him riding a friend¹s electric<br/>\nscooter. He then decided he wanted one. He started browsing online and<br/>\nwithin a week had changed his mind from an electric scooter ($200) to an<br/>\nelectric riding toy to an electric dirt bike to a gas dirt bike ($2800). We<br/>\nhave told him that we do not have that quantity of money available for his<br/>\nentertainment. We talk about gas usage and cost, clean air, what he might<br/>\nhave to choose not to do/have in order to free up those funds. He looks at<br/>\nour finances with us in Quicken, and then gets all upset because it looks to<br/>\nhim like we have a lot in savings. We explain that we want 6 mos of living<br/>\nexpenses and need to replenish the money we just spent on a car and property<br/>\ntaxes and etc. So they money he sees in the accounts is not available for<br/>\nspending. He says we are mean and gets all upset. Over the last 2 months he<br/>\nhas continues to look for something with a motor for his entertainment. He<br/>\nis now stomping and yelling at me when he says things like ³lets buy this<br/>\n$15,000 boat² and I say that is unreasonable. I am getting tired of his<br/>\nreactions and requests. We have talked about his needs such as he knows what<br/>\nthey are (fun). He has experience handling money and saved $70 on his own<br/>\nfor his racing bike last year (a $700 purchase). I have helped him make a<br/>\nlist of desirable qualities of this vehicle (goes fast), we have talked<br/>\nabout where he could ride it (basically on the driveway for a dirt bike<br/>\nwithout purchasing a hitch, trailer, and paying fees for a track), I have<br/>\ntaken him window shopping to sit on the vehicles (they don¹t allow test<br/>\ndrives). I asked a friend with a motorcycle to give ds a ride, and ds said<br/>\nhe would think about it (not gotten back to me yet). I think I need help<br/>\nseeing a better way of handling this situation. Dh thinks I have been<br/>\nstringing ds along because dh does not want to purchase any of these items.<br/>\nOh, and ds has yet to save even $1 for this vehicle which he says is really<br/>\nimportant. Any ideas?<br/>\n----------------<br/>\nZoa Conner, PhD<br/>\nPhysicist and Organic Learning Mother<br/>\nzoaconner@comcast. &lt;mailto:zoaconner%40comcast.net&gt; net<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Widening world, money, and 9 year old","postDate":"1216595409","msgId":34684,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc2MGdraCt0NXZlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEM0QThEOEIwLkU0QjIlem9hY29ubmVyQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":34660,"nextInTopic":34733,"prevInTime":34683,"nextInTime":34685,"topicId":34628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... focus is on ... about costs ... he is ... the money ...

It might also be helpful to verbalize some of <br/>\nyour everyday decision making more so that your ds can see what some <br/>\nof that looks like. Even simple things like &quot;oh, this soup is more <br/>\nnutritious than the generic even though it cost more&quot; shows him <br/>\nsomething about the ways adults think and make decisions.

And that his <br/>\nneed for fun not quite as important as your need for six months of <br/>\nliving expenses.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that six months of &quot;safe&quot; living shouldn&#39;t include no fun. <br/>\nSeriously. What&#39;s a &quot;paid for life&quot; if you can&#39;t have fun? Wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nfive months with a &quot;cushion&quot; AND a whole lot of fun be better than six <br/>\nmonths of NO fun at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I think I need help<br/>\nseeing a better way of handling this situation. Dh thinks I have been<br/>\nstringing ds along because dh does not want to purchase any of these <br/>\nitems.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s talk about that a sec:<br/>\n<br/>\nWHAT?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould the mindset be different if the child wanted an expensive <br/>\nmicroscope or telescope? (I&#39;m trying to think of &quot;educational&quot; or more <br/>\n&quot;grown up&quot; items---something less *fun*.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSooo...wait him out so that he&#39;ll quit wanting it? What kind of example <br/>\nare you modeling? Not taking others&#39; wants/needs seriously? But your <br/>\nson needs to take *your* need to have a six month cushion seriously?<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know how that works out! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and ds has yet to save even $1 for this vehicle which he says is <br/>\nreally<br/>\nimportant. Any ideas?<br/>\n0A<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you knew there was $5000 in your mattress, would you be trying <br/>\nreally hard to earn $50? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, it may not about actually *getting* the dirt bike. Your <br/>\nimmediate brakes to his thought process may have taken him by surprise. <br/>\nMade him feel less important to you than the mortgage. *IS* he less <br/>\nimportant to you?<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to dirt bike events. Get to know dirt-bikers. Show up weekend after <br/>\nweekend. Become a part of the &quot;gang.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSubscribe to dirt bike magazines, buy shirts with dirt bikes on them, <br/>\nfind dirt bike videos to watch on Youtube.<br/>\n<br/>\nFill his world with all the dirt bikes you can without actually buying <br/>\none right now. But agree to put aside so much $$ each week/month for a <br/>\nused bike. Work WITH him to help him meet his passion. Maybe suggest <br/>\nthat the money you normally spend on movies or ice cream or Starbucks <br/>\ncould be put aside for the bike. If *everyone* of you sacrificed just a <br/>\nlittle, maybe it *will* become affordable. Let him see you working WITH <br/>\nhim rather than shutting him down.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ALL love to help others in our sport---especially newbies. After the <br/>\nsecond or third event, I&#39;d bet someone would offer him a ride. After <br/>\nthe eighth or tenth, someone may say, &quot;You know, I have pretty old dirt <br/>\nbike in the garage. It needs some work, but if you&#39;re willing to help <br/>\nme fix that carburetor....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is to quit shutting him down. NOW.<br/>\n0A<br/>\nI&#39;m NOT saying that you have to go right out and spend $3000 on a dirt <br/>\nbike. *We* couldn&#39;t do that. (Not after the $7000 we just spent to send <br/>\nour son to the Yukon for four weeks!) But it&#39;s important to take their <br/>\nwants and needs seriously.

It started out with him riding a friend¹s electric<br/>\nscooter. He then decided he wanted one. He started browsing online and<br/>\nwithin a week had changed his mind from an electric scooter ($200) to an<br/>\nelectric riding toy to an electric dirt bike to a gas dirt bike ($2800). We<br/>\nhave told him that we do not have that quantity of money available for his<br/>\nentertainment. We talk about gas usage and cost, clean air, what he might<br/>\nhave to choose not to do/have in order to free up those funds. He looks at<br/>\nour finances with us in Quicken, and then gets all upset because it looks to<br/>\nhim like we have a lot in savings. We explain that we want 6 mos of living<br/>\nexpenses and need to replenish the money we just spent on a car and property<br/>\ntaxes and etc. So they money he sees in the accounts is not available for<br/>\nspending. He says we are mean and gets all upset. Over the last 2 months he<br/>\nhas continues to look for something with a motor for his entertainment. He<br/>\nis now stomping and yelling at me when he says things like ³lets buy this<br/>\n$15,000 boat² and I say that is unreasonable. I am getting tired of his<br/>\nreactions and requests. We have talked about his needs such as he knows what<br/>\nthey are (fun). He has experience handling money and saved $70 on his own<br/>\nfor his racing bike last year (a $700 purchase). I have helped him make a<br/>\nlist of desirable qualities of this vehicle (goes fast), we have talked<br/>\nabout where he could ride it (basically on the driveway for a dirt bike<br/>\nwithout purchasing a hitch, trailer, and paying fees for a track), I have<br/>\ntaken him window shopping to sit on the vehicles (they don¹t allow test<br/>\ndrives). I asked a friend with a motorcycle to give ds a ride, and ds said<br/>\nhe would think about it (not gotten back to me yet). I think I need help<br/>\nseeing a better way of handling this situation. Dh thinks I have been<br/>\nstringing ds along because dh does not want to purchase any of these items.<br/>\nOh, and ds has yet to save even $1 for this vehicle which he says is really<br/>\nimportant.
