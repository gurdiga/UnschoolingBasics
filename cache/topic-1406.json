Even my<br/>\nclose friends don&#39;t get it.  Making me think that  I would be better off<br/>\nfinding new friends rather than rehashing the same  old explanations over and<br/>\nover again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nJumping off from here...<br/>\n <br/>\nI have the same frustration, especially now that we&#39;re meeting new people  <br/>\nall the time, having just moved, and getting to know each other better.  I  am <br/>\nvery aware that an unschooling and respectful, gentle parenting attitude can  <br/>\ncome off as snobish or arrogant.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI make jokes about it.  People have asked why Will is so calm when  he&#39;s <br/>\npitching in a baseball game.  He is a really good pitcher (I  don&#39;t take credit at <br/>\nall, he&#39;s a natural), and when he&#39;s called in to close a  game he usually <br/>\njust throws strikes and you can see that he&#39;s not feeling any  pressure at all.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s as &quot;cool as a cucumber&quot; so that even the umpires  notice and comment.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s only 10, so that impresses people in  baseball.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI joke around with people who comment and who know he doesn&#39;t go to  school.  <br/>\nI say, &quot;He lives the life of Riley!&quot;  What pressure could he  possibly have <br/>\nif he doesn&#39;t have to get up in the morning and go to school!?  yada yada&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nBut those people also see me act lovingly toward him off the field, and I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t lecture him about how to pitch or hit and I don&#39;t scream at him from the  <br/>\nsidelines (except when he&#39;s pitching a few too many balls I might remind him <br/>\nto  breath out on the throw).  I barely even mention his performance except to  <br/>\nask him if he had fun.  His father, who is the coach, doesn&#39;t lecture him  <br/>\neither.  (Coaching is a different thing from lecturing, and it can be done  <br/>\nrespectfully, as well).<br/>\n <br/>\nIn the same way that I demonstrate (do) gentle parenting to other people  <br/>\nwith my own child, I try to demonstrate it with theirs as well.  There&#39;s a  <br/>\nlittle boy named Kyle.  He&#39;s only about 6 or 7 and he&#39;s the younger brother  of <br/>\nWill&#39;s teammate.  I&#39;ve spent a lot of time with their parents, and it&#39;s  clear <br/>\nthat Kyle is the &quot;bad son&quot; to them.  They joke about how difficult  and busy he <br/>\nis, and I know they love him.  But it&#39;s clear to me that it&#39;s  going to become <br/>\nself-fulfilling and they don&#39;t even realize it.  So, I take  every chance I <br/>\nget to say positive things about him to his parents, and to tell  him how sweet <br/>\nI think he is.  (He is sweet, really.  These parents  don&#39;t really have a <br/>\nclue what a difficult child is.)  I try to sympathize  with them and point out <br/>\nhow normal Kyle is.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t get an opportunity to talk about unschooling with these public  <br/>\nschool parents at baseball games.  I probably wouldn&#39;t take it anyway,  because I <br/>\nhave to live in this small community and I can&#39;t afford to be  ostrasized for <br/>\nmy beliefs.  But to help allieve my frustration at not being  able to talk <br/>\nabout it, I can do things differently and say things differently  and offer calm <br/>\nand peace and contentment in my visible parenting.  Lots of  them have already <br/>\nnoticed.<br/>\n <br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Interacting at school, playgrounds and\tlife","postDate":"1089105164","msgId":1445,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEMEZFNTRDLjI4QzZCJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE1MzUxOUJCLUNGMjYtMTFEOC05MDk3LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":1443,"nextInTopic":1449,"prevInTime":1444,"nextInTime":1446,"topicId":1406,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Since my boy&#39;s were born I haven&#39;t<br/>\nbeen able to volunteer as much time, but still managed to hold an officers<br/>\nposition in the PTA, volunteer and run around raising money and  gifts for<br/>\nteacher appreciation day.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s so surprising to me how much I&#39;ve<br/>\nchanged.  These people haven&#39;t changed; it&#39;s definitely me.  I think for the<br/>\nbetter, but they don&#39;t and that on some level bothers me.  Makes me feel<br/>\nisolated, like I&#39;m the only one thinking the things that I think.  Even my<br/>\nclose friends don&#39;t get it.  Making me think that I would be better off<br/>\nfinding new friends rather than rehashing the same old explanations over and<br/>\nover again.  I get questions like; why do you spend so much time with your<br/>\nkids? and Wouldn&#39;t sending them to preschool help them to live more<br/>\nindependently so that you could get out once in awhile? huh I got that one<br/>\ntoday!<br/>\nWhy don&#39;t these people get that I LOVE being with my kids.  They are awesome<br/>\npeople that I CHOOSE to be with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnMarie<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: pam sorooshian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Monday, July 05, 2004 12:06 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Interacting at school, playgrounds and<br/>\nlife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   On Jul 5, 2004, at 8:18 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Eberwhite@...\">Eberwhite@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I wonder if we have problems relating to others who don&#39;t share our<br/>\n  &gt; belief<br/>\n  &gt; system or our life/unschooling/gentle parenting philosophies because<br/>\n  &gt; we are<br/>\n  &gt; being too judgemental.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; If you would have seen me 5 years ago as the president of my kids PTO,<br/>\n  &gt; what<br/>\n  &gt; would you have thought?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But it is watching the kids, lined up and barked at and all that, which<br/>\n  is sad.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And - when we are spending time around parents who really do spend so<br/>\n  MUCH time complaining about their kids&#39; schools - that is sad too.
