Your kids ARE<br/>\n&gt; learning everyday, all the time.  They are problem-solving, figuring out<br/>\n&gt; social ammenities, making plans, figuring out how to carry those<br/>\n&gt; out.  They<br/>\n&gt; are learning about right and wrong, thinking about what God/Goddess might<br/>\n&gt; looks like (if they are inclined that way).  A few lessons that you DON&#39;T<br/>\n&gt; want them to learn is that learning is boring, somebody else is in control<br/>\n&gt; of it and that it only happens at certain times, doing certain things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So have fun.  Suggest cool things to do.  Go for a hike, make baklava,<br/>\n&gt; read<br/>\n&gt; African legends, watch lots of tv in your pajamas while eating ice cream.<br/>\n&gt; Talk about things you/they notice...like the bird you saw looked like a<br/>\n&gt; wren<br/>\n&gt; but with different coloring, that saying &quot;baklava&quot; sounds like you are<br/>\n&gt; coughing, etc..  Think of the things you/they notice as little dots of<br/>\n&gt; illumination into the world.  Keep having fun, keep laughing and<br/>\n&gt; eventually<br/>\n&gt; those little dots start to make connections to each other.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; happen so much in a few months but in the course of years as your children<br/>\n&gt; grow and start to see the world at different levels of understanding.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Relax, enjoy, drink eggnogg.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Julie S.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Lesa McMahon-Lowe &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lesajm@...\">lesajm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Monday, December 5, 2005 4:48 pm<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Deschooling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anastasia (and anyone else who&#39;s been through it),<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How is the deschooling going?

We re still deschooling, and I m thinking","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1074661051\">I was just where you are about three weeks ago, so I&#39;m probably not the best person to ask about how to unschool.  We&#39;re still deschooling, and I&#39;m thinking unschooling won&#39;t be much different in our home.  I was just this morning telling a newbie school-at-home mom heading for burnout what we do, so I&#39;ll post what I told her, because it shows how we&#39;re starting to let go.  Maybe it&#39;ll help, maybe not.  We do a lot of day-to-day things, like errands and such.  We&#39;re down to one car that dh uses to get to work right now, so we don&#39;t go to museums or parks (it&#39;s too cold to walk anywhere here!) or much other &quot;interesting&quot; stuff.  It&#39;s ok for us, because there&#39;s plenty of time for that.  I stick to the practical due to necessity.  But the kids have learned about reduce/reuse/recycle when it comes to Christmas presents this year!  They&#39;ve amazed me with what they&#39;ve come up with for gifts.  They come up with the idea and carry it through to the end all on their own, without any money<br/>\n at all.  But here&#39;s what I had to say to the other mom about our deschooling experience so far.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We&#39;re deschooling right now and loving it!  It&#39;s so much less taxing on everyone than when we started out in Sept. as gung-ho homeschoolers.  I got burnt out within a month and wondered what I was doing wrong.  The kids rebelled even though I gave them choices.  Then I just sat back and let the kids lead, and there&#39;s so much of a difference in their behavior and attitude and creativity that I am astounded.  For example - They played CSI last week (must be my CSI/Law & Order habit is rubbing off on them,) and they interviewed me last week CSI-style and collected evidence (including my hair) and viewed it under a microscope and found a murder weapon and figured out my motive.  It was just too cool!  They were typing away on the play laptop entering notes and looking up pretend info on the case.  They took my fingerprints, though I only let them have one because I didn&#39;t want inky fingers all day.  They have never done anything like this play before, and I wouldn&#39;t have considered it<br/>\n learning before now, either.  It took me a lot of courage to start unschooling, and the worst part is explaining it to others (which I avoid-ignorance is bliss.)  But if you find you&#39;re fighting or burnt out, it&#39;s worth a try.  The kids still learn, but it&#39;s on their terms and their timing and their way.  Trust is the key.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnastasia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLesa McMahon-Lowe &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lesajm@...\">lesajm@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  Anastasia (and anyone else who&#39;s been through it),<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is the deschooling going?

Suggest cool things to do.  Go for a hike, make baklava, read African legends, watch lots of tv in your pajamas while eating ice cream.  Talk about things you/they notice...like the bird you saw looked like a wren but with different coloring, that saying &quot;baklava&quot; sounds like you are coughing, etc..

I&#39;ve thought<br/>\nof myself as an unschooler since my daughter was about 4. The kids are now<br/>\nages 8 and 4. My daughter went to preschool until she was 4 and then no<br/>\nlonger wanted to attend cause she didn&#39;t like her new teacher. My son tried<br/>\npreschool this past fall. He was so eager to try and after two weeks<br/>\nadamantly wanted out and has sworn off school since. I thought that going to<br/>\nschool might help him make more friends in our town--he thought it would be<br/>\nlike Barney :-/ Boy, were we both wrong!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of deschooling has so many layers I think. On Sandra Dodd&#39;s<br/>\nwebsite, she recommends some movies to watch while deschooling. Its hard for<br/>\nme to not think of this as an assignment, an ingredient in learning<br/>\nnecessary for me to really deschool. Does anyone kwim? Or reading Holt.

Its schooling that encourages this sort of thinking<br/>\nof knowledge coming from authorities from without--its hard to just think<br/>\nabout ideas as simply ideas--to be mulled over, shelved or acted on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went out to eat at to a hibachi steakhouse for my daughter&#39;s birthday .<br/>\nWe were sitting with some strangers (if you&#39;ve never been to such a place,<br/>\neveryone sits around the grill and watches the chef throw utensils, stir fry<br/>\nfood, make an onion volcano, and make fire. The people we were sitting with<br/>\nwere from our town. Of course, the conversation turned immediately to<br/>\nschool. These people were chatty question askers. Does anyone else not want<br/>\nto talk about unschooling with schooling people? We managed to not share<br/>\nthat we were homeschooling by saying we lived by such and such school. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to talk about homeschooling with them. I didn&#39;t want to defend<br/>\nwhat we are doing or try to explain it. I wanted to watch the fire making<br/>\nchef and have fun with the kids. I like when summer comes cause no well<br/>\nmeaning stranger is asking me why my kids aren&#39;t in school during the<br/>\nday......<br/>\n<br/>\nI live right next to an elementary school, the &quot;best&quot; in my town according<br/>\nto local parents. From my back porch a stone&#39;s throw would break a few car<br/>\nwindows in the parking lot, and from the end of my yard, I could do some<br/>\ndamage to the large plate glass windows of the library. That&#39;s how close I<br/>\nam. (Many moons ago, we thought that having the school so close would be<br/>\ngreat for our theoretical kids) The sounds of the bus, bell ringing and<br/>\nannouncements over the loud speaker are all a part of our day. So its<br/>\ndifficult to forget about school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to get a t-shirt that says something like &quot;growing without schooling&quot;<br/>\n(don&#39;t ask me--www.unschooling.com--for more info) :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nLeslie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20191,"nextTopicId":20262}}
