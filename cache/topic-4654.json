Shoot even my hubby is into Yu-Gi-Oh with<br/>\nthe boys and has many decks and duels with them sometimes until all<br/>\nhours of the night!:)LOL!! <br/>\n<br/>\nTo quote from a few excerpts from my book &quot;One of the most exciting<br/>\naspects of Life Long Leaning is that of watching your children grow<br/>\nand learn through their passions in life. At times these passions can<br/>\nbe quite intense, and other times they are often fleeting.<br/>\nNo, I am not describing a passionate romance between two people, but<br/>\nrather a &quot;love affair&quot; of learning in a particular thing that<br/>\ninterests them. This is something can lead to a lifetime passion or<br/>\nmaybe even become your child&#39;s life career. Or, it could be something<br/>\nthat your child has an interest in for a day or two......Now, of<br/>\ncourse, our boys have their share of ever fleeting love affairs with<br/>\ncertain passionate interests. There is the remote control cars, of<br/>\nwhich they love playing with and troubleshooting when they break, but<br/>\nonce they are broken beyond foreseeable repair, they move on to the<br/>\nnext interest. There has been interests in rocks, paper mache, candle<br/>\nmaking, writing on the white board in our bedroom (and sometimes they<br/>\nwill even write math problems along with their sketches and stories<br/>\nthey make on the board), sewing, guitar playing and many, many other<br/>\ninterests. Much more than I can ever write here!<br/>\nOne of the most wonderful parts of Life Long Learning is that we<br/>\nsimply have our whole lives to learn from as in-depth of an interest<br/>\nas we wish, as well as the fleeting interests. The key is to get into<br/>\nour children&#39;s&#39; passions with them and learn together. It can open up<br/>\nthe world to so many other connections of learning that you never even<br/>\ndreamed possible!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Love and Light,<br/>\n <br/>\nPatti Diamond and the boys (Life Long Learners Chris 13 1/2, Matthew<br/>\n8, Anthony 7)<br/>\nLife Long Learning Academy<br/>\nJUST PUBLISHED!! &quot;Life Long Learning ~ Transforming Learning -<br/>\nDiscovering Learning Through Living Life in Unlimitless Possibilities&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lifelonglearning4all.com\">http://www.lifelonglearning4all.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.diamondlady.net\">http://www.diamondlady.net</a><br/>\n <br/>\n*NOTE - Look for me to speak on Life Long Learning at the CHN<br/>\nHomelearning Expo June 10-11, 2005.
