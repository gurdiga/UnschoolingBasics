And just for the record.. that IS true. Sugar rots teeth,<br/>\nno matter what you say.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to break it but this is not true!  It may effect SOME people <br/>\nthat way if they live on candy alone and never brush their teeth but <br/>\nit has more to do with genetics than anything.  My son only brushed <br/>\nhis teeth about once a month and ate plenty of candy when he was much <br/>\nyounger.  We went to the dentist and I was sure that he was going to <br/>\nhave cavities and that just might get him to brush his teeth more <br/>\noften.  Well, NO cavities, not a one, and we only go to the dentist <br/>\nonce every three or four years.  In fact, all my kids eat candy and <br/>\nonly one of my children has ever had a cavity and it was so small they <br/>\nground it down in about 5 seconds with no numbing involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaying candy rots your teeth is like saying if you tan in a tanning <br/>\nbed you WILL get cancer.  Wrong!  There are a lot of factors involved.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20459,"nextTopicId":20358}}
