What is happening in many of our schools is that if your child<br/>\ncan be on SCOS they are mainstreamed many times without appropriate<br/>\nsupport for behavioral and social issues which these children tend to<br/>\nstruggle with.   Many regular classroom teachers have no training or<br/>\nexperience with this population but are expected to handle this child<br/>\nin the regular classroom without much help.   The parents are told if<br/>\nthey child needs more support than that they need to be in a self<br/>\ncontained classroom where many times the child is not allowed to be on<br/>\nthe SCOS because they require a separate classroom (most restrictive<br/>\nplacement) and well you see the tangled web!!!<br/>\nIn our county here in NC  they are doing away with many self contained<br/>\nclassrooms and mainstreaming any child they think they can... teachers<br/>\nhave no additional training or support and many times neither does the<br/>\nchild but the parents are basically told they have to chose how<br/>\n&quot;impaired&quot; their child is and don&#39;t we all want our child to be<br/>\nchallenged in life? (UGH!)    <br/>\nSo basically this child is being being blamed for being different and<br/>\nneeding the supports the school refuses to give him from an untrained<br/>\nteacher(who seems to have some difficulty being a decent human to<br/>\nboot) and people just want to blame his parents for this whole<br/>\ncatastrophe!     <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway just another perspective and one more time in life I have to<br/>\nsay I am so glad my kids typical and otherwise don&#39;t have to be at the<br/>\nmercy of such a broken system.<br/>\nLisa B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ann329851&quot;<br/>\n&lt;annworsley991@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  i dont post very often, but i just read this one. and its horrible <br/>\n&gt; that a woman who is in the postion of care giver for a chile can do <br/>\n&gt; this.
