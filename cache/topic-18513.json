It seems that the sense of crisis peaked. Since I wrote my son moved his laptop back into the family computer room and is more interactive. I<br/>\nt is hard because I am not the main at-home parent. My husband is. He is generally very involved with what our son is doing. My husband was a fine artist and in fact, learned computer animation just to do it with my son. There are some things that I tend to be more receptive about than my husband, but I have a demanding worklife and my time and energy is too limited for me to watch or read or play with a lot of what our son is doing although I try to do this sometimes. Also, while I do have passions,  they are very girly passions like sewing and belly dancing.<br/>\nBut, you are right and I find that my worry subsides and things feel better when I am participating in something with him. During the winter, I plan to play WOW with him, something we did last year. I have some thoughts of planning a family or even unschooling trip to Japan partly because I think that this would serve as some impetus for fun preparation such as learning some Japanese.<br/>\nRegarding his emotional state as Linda suggests, I do think that in the past week he did have some difficult feelings bubbling. He is not good at verbalizing feelings unless he is really in crisis. I don&#39;t think he was depressed. In fact, I think my worry that he might be depressed made me behave in ways that made things worse. I may have been hovering and this contributed to his withdrawal from my intrusive shadowing presence. I believe I associate someone&#39;s being alone to their being depressed because that was true for me when I was younger.<br/>\nWhat someone wrote about their child not needing much interaction with other kids is true for my son. This sometimes is hard for me to really take in because of my being too influenced about conventional notions about being social. These notions may also interfere with my ability to enjoy myself enough when I am alone, even though I want time alone. <br/>\nMy son gets a lot of contact, actually, through the computer, through online forums that comment instantly on anime series. (He was lately enchanted by Code-Lyoco). There is an American manga serial Megatokyo that he is following. Lots of things seem to generate a lively dialog online. While this is nothing that I grew up with and would consider social, it does allow my son to interact with others about his interests. <br/>\nHe really doesn&#39;t like to go places much. He did when he was younger and believe me, I am only too willing to take him places. This may be a factor of his getting older. It also may be a factor of the wealth of material that he now can find for free on his computer. He does not need to buy mangas at a bookstore because he can download them. He is very skilled about getting around and finding what he wants on the Internet. <br/>\nI think I feel more sense of perspective from the comments. I think that a parent&#39;s maintaining her perspective is key.<br/>\nThanks, Andrea<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":63209806,"authorName":"lpodietz","from":"&quot;lpodietz&quot; &lt;lpodietz@...&gt;","profile":"lpodietz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Solitary Child","postDate":"1161725279","msgId":18540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVobTBndis3bjcxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYxMDIzLjA0MTk1Ni4xNTQ0OS4xMDMyODA0QHdlYm1haWwzMy5sYXgudW50ZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":18524,"nextInTopic":18550,"prevInTime":18539,"nextInTime":18541,"topicId":18513,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Andrea, Thanks for the extra clarification about what led your son to leave school.

(does it run in the family?--you don&#39;t have <br/>\nto answer that).  I don&#39;t know how forthcoming he is in terms of his <br/>\ninner feelings, but he seems about the age where there can be all <br/>\nkinds of turmoil going on beneath the surface (even in an <br/>\nunschooling environment), and I&#39;m wondering if he has an outlet for <br/>\nwhatever he&#39;s trying to process inside (perhaps other than his <br/>\nparents... especially since he&#39;s an only child).

There are anime viewing groups (anime DVD&#39;s are<br/>\natrociously expensive so many anime collectors will get together to<br/>\nshare the anime that they have.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children have few friends their own ages.  Even in our homeschool<br/>\ngroup they seem to have somehow moved to the periphery during the<br/>\nsummer.  That&#39;s ok with them.  They have plenty of opportunities to<br/>\nsocialise with adults.  While they wish that there was a huge<br/>\nunschooling community in which they could thrive, they prefer to spend<br/>\ntime alone at home.  They actually prefer going and doing their<br/>\ninterests without concern as to how many children are present.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe engaged in his world.  Learn Japanese with him.  Rent anime (many<br/>\nvideo stores have a whole anime section these days) and watch with<br/>\nhim.  Read one of his manga series and talk to him about these things.<br/>\n He has some really interesting passions.  Look into the JET programme<br/>\nwhich is a Japanese-English exchange program.  (Google Jet programme<br/>\nwith the extra me)  Play video games with him (even if you suck at it<br/>\n- I do and it is like a major comedy hour when mom plays PS2!  &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\nlost I&#39;m lost!!  What do you mean go back?  I don&#39;t even know where<br/>\nback is!!!!&quot;)  He has some great passions!  Strew in front of him even<br/>\nmore!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for being an only child, my co-parent was essentially an only<br/>\nchild.  He was one of those &quot;Ooops babies&quot; who was born 13 years after<br/>\nhis older brothers.  By the time he entered kindergarden he was the<br/>\nonly one at home.

It will be interesting if this proves rel event.<br/>\nAdli always struggled with school, not academically. That came easy. His struggle was with the school structure. The vast majority of what was taught and how things were done seemed empty and controlling. At home we always gave him a lot freedom and were not coercive except for our expectations around his going to school. We mostly followed an attachement parenting approach and our son always like to spend a lot of time at home. Socially, it felt fair. That was not the reason he left but the social dimension wasn&#39;t motivating for him as it is for some kids.  <br/>\nHe cites two teachers who were really nice and those were good years where he had a best friend who was a girl and then became good friends with a boy who lives down the block. He had some horrible years with too strict teachers or classes with kids that were aggressive. He never got especially interested in any activities in school and would not commit to any after-school activities. <br/>\nThe point of no return was was when he started middle school which in our district begins in fifth grade. This was really hyped up and highly anticipated. But it turned out to be even more boring and rigid. I saved something he wrote for the first day in which he had to complete sentences (it figures) and in response to the prompt: &quot;Homeroom day is...&quot; ,  he wrote, &quot;the most boring day of school I have ever seen in my life.&quot; <br/>\nThe children were shuttled from class to class for nine periods a day. The homework was even more tedious, long and inane. Several of the teachers, including the gifted teacher, were mean and picky. There was more gym and intramural sports. Getting our son up in the morning each day was a real chore and became increasingly impossible. Later after we let him stop school, he described it movingly as a prison.<br/>\nLet me know if that gives any additional insight. BTW, we had a much better day yesterday after I wrote. I had the chance to spend with him and see what he was doing, which turned out to be interesting. He came downstairs at night and played a lively physical game with our dog and then as a family, we played boggle. By the end of the day, I felt much better but I know that the concerns and issues that I wrote about are still lurking, just not in such an intense way.<br/>\nThanks, Andrea <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":63209806,"authorName":"lpodietz","from":"&quot;lpodietz&quot; &lt;lpodietz@...&gt;","profile":"lpodietz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Solitary Child","postDate":"1161604712","msgId":18516,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVoaWFwOCtlb2I0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYxMDIzLjA0MTk1Ni4xNTQ0OS4xMDMyODA0QHdlYm1haWwzMy5sYXgudW50ZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":18513,"nextInTopic":18523,"prevInTime":18515,"nextInTime":18517,"topicId":18513,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"[--- In unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com, pinkydog@... ... after attending public school.] Hi Andrea, Aaron s mom here....

I think that he and my husband and I have successfully deschooled and embrace all aspects of unschooling. His main interests are manga, anime, fanfiction, Japanese, computer animation and humor. He spends the vast majority of his time on the computer. My concerns about him are mostly social. He has always been a socially hesitant child. He likes the company of other children but only if he knows them well and feels a strong affinity with them. He also engages in almost no physical activity and has always been significantly overweight.<br/>\nLately he has gotten more withdrawn and solitary. We started a homeschool computer group in our home but apart from that, he has no contact with other children. He also does not seek out others and will not, for example, ask anyone to come over his house. He has always preferred to be at home and we have a very kid-friendly entertaining home. But lately, he has became more withdrawn. For the past eight days or so, he moved his laptop into his bedroom and comes out only rarely. Yet when we interact with him, it seems that he is feeling alright. <br/>\nI feel he must be bored and unhappy but I also fear that I may be projecting my own feelings and experience about what it has been like for me when I have been too alone. He had lost some weight and has now regained it which I think is due to his increased inactivity. He expresses no negative feelings about his weight, but then again he is not the type of child that expresses his negative self feelings. Both my husband and I are somewhat introverted, but not like this. We don&#39;t know whether we should try harder or intervene, whether this is a phase that we need to give him time with or whether we are just being narrow-minded and judgemental about a way of being that our son feels fine with.<br/>\nI am hoping that some of you have had similar experiences and am looking for words of wisdom or solace.<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAndrea<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18588,"nextTopicId":18590}}
