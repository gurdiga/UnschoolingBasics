I&#39;ve been reading since last fall, but everything just clicked into place a few weeks ago.  Easy evening have only been happening for about 4 nights now.  Last night was *so* lovely!  I&#39;ve been able to let go of &#39;waiting&#39; for them to ask to go to bed and just *be*.  And they seem to have relaxed into the evenings too knowing that they are running their own show.  Last night they didn&#39;t get out of bed at all once they asked to go to sleep, and were asleep in under 2 minutes.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  What seems to work for us is to cuddle up on the couch with a movie or books, otherwise they just seem to go and go and go until 11p.m.  They really get excited about us all cuddling on the couch, and it at least enables them to stop long enough to realize they&#39;re tired.  The food thing is interesting too.  Since we have stopped making a big deal about them sitting with us at the table to eat dinner they don&#39;t!  Last night they chose to not have one bite of anything supperish, and suprisingly it was totally okay for me.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Apparently I am finally learning to go with the flow.  Following their lead is so ultra calm, they get their wants and their needs met, they don&#39;t have to meltdown because someone is constantly saying no and not hearing them (not to say we never have meltdowns, they are still 3 years old and emotionally roller coasting pretty much all day).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I do the same thing with pjs and teeth brushing.  Last night Jade said yes she wanted to brush and Skye said no - then all on her own this morning went and brushed her teeth.

One of the arguments my ex and I had was he felt we should put all the kids down at the same time -- at that age ranged from 3  - 5  (3 of them)  his two and mine.  I had always let ds jsut fall asleep on couch, chair anywhere and was not real strict on time..  His were expected to go to bed at 9:30 at their moms and when at his moms ???  It was a continual argument,  me forcing my child to go to bed when they did even when he didn&#39;t want to.... All of is it was going against my grain but I was trying to blend our families and &quot;compromise&quot; all I did was force my child to be angry and &quot;unruly&quot; (lack of better word -- he really wasn&#39;t) .  Any way - boyfriend gone and I am back to creating a peaceful calm , consensual home for my boys and I.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thank you for letting me talk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Are yours identical?

One of the things that is showing up is that they aren&#39;t tired at the same time. They have done everything pretty much at exactly the same time since they were born, even when they have had rashes they have appeared in the same place. So again, the biggest part of this is *our* learning, not our teaching. The last 2 nights in a row Skye has asked to go to sleep before Jade and asked me to lay down with her, and she was asleep in about 3 minutes. Then Jade hung out with Ryan in the living room, asked for some cheese and crackers, then all of a sudden said she was tired, crawled onto the couch with him and fell asleep snuggled...nice! They still seem to really enjoy the bedtime routine (bath, pjs, stories in bed), then they get up and do their own thing after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yay, I didn&#39;t even think of &#39;waiting&#39; for them to ask to go to sleep, nor did I ask them repeatedly &#39;are you tired&#39;, &#39;are you ready to go to sleep&#39;?
