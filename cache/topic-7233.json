What you are then depriving<br/>\nthem and yourself of are the startlingly brilliant, extraordinary, more<br/>\ncreative choices that they would make for themselves, when they are able to<br/>\nbe the fully autonomous arbiters of their own learning and managers of their<br/>\nown time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhilever you are the person deciding which of their needs or interests is<br/>\nworthy of fulfilling, you are depriving them of the opportunity to fully<br/>\nknow themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; We do alot of things together as a family because <br/>\nit&#39;s just what we do...we don&#39;t offer them the choice to not <br/>\nparticipate with family/household responsibilites - it&#39;s not really <br/>\nquestioned, it&#39;s just what we do. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBy relinquishing the desire to control, you help your child onto the path of<br/>\nliving mindfully themselves, making choices and decisions mindfully and<br/>\ndeliberately, instead of reactively. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you react if the lack of choice *were* to be questioned one day?<br/>\nWould your subsequent actions be likely to enhance or detract from your<br/>\nrelationship with your children? <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are assuming that given the choice the children would never choose to<br/>\nhelp. The lists are full of stories of children spontaneously helping, doing<br/>\nunasked cleaning or tidying as gifts for their parents, doing *more* than<br/>\nthe children with externally directed chores ever offer or do.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The tv does not stay on all <br/>\nday...I really haven&#39;t felt at this point like I have to RESTRICT <br/>\ntheir tv watching because there is typically something more <br/>\ninteresting for them to do but it does go off after our rather late <br/>\nbreakfasts.  BUT if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL <br/>\nday EVERY day was watch tv.....I would have a problem with that. (I <br/>\ncan&#39;t really see that happening but...) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt happens here sometimes, and then it doesn&#39;t sometimes. I make no rules,<br/>\ngive no directives, although I do remind her of other things that might be<br/>\navailable in the smorgasbord of activities. My dd gets to choose what<br/>\nactivities are of value *to her*. Sometimes that includes a lot of tv. Then<br/>\nshe is done for a while. I Trust her to know her own desires. I verbally and<br/>\nphysically appreciate her enthusiasm and joy in her chosen love of the<br/>\nmoment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSwitch it around a bit with different words:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was<br/>\nread books&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was<br/>\nDig in the garden&quot;....<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was<br/>\nPlay their violins&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was<br/>\nRide their horse&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was<br/>\nSwim&quot;....<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact is that even if it is ALL they want to do for ALL day EVERY day, it<br/>\nwill still be temporary; EVERY day would still not last forever. It would be<br/>\na temporary need being fulfilled. Discovering and facilitating the<br/>\nchildren&#39;s passions is another tentpole of Unschooling practice. A child<br/>\ndiscovering something that they *want* every day is cause for celebration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way to know if your children genuinely, truly want to do the other<br/>\nactivities is if they have the option to choose not to do them. They can<br/>\nonly choose to switch it off when they have the option to leave it on. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The girls don&#39;t choose when <br/>\nthey go bed.  We don&#39;t have a &quot;set&quot; bedtime...it flexes depending on <br/>\nwhat time they got up, what we&#39;re doing the next day and how early we <br/>\nhave to get up and how everyone is acting and feeling.   Ultimately <br/>\nthough, when it&#39;s time...it&#39;s time.   Once again, it&#39;s not typically <br/>\nquestioned because they&#39;re tired and we have a nice routine that we <br/>\nfollow and they share a bed/bedroom so they chit chat and do shadow <br/>\npuppets,etc. BUT if they decided that they wanted to stay up till 11 <br/>\nor 12 or later....well, I don&#39;t consider that an option for a 7 and 5 <br/>\nyear old. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly there is no need to fix what isn&#39;t broken, or borrow trouble from<br/>\na currently non-existent future scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever what I would encourage you to think about is just how arbitrary the<br/>\ntimes are that you mention. There is nothing magical about any particular<br/>\nhour on the clock, especially if the next day is fluid. Some children are<br/>\nnaturally night owls, even when they are 7 and 5. Some are going to be early<br/>\nrising morning people for their entire lives. What is important is<br/>\nunderstanding and facilitating everyone&#39;s needs as much as is possible. At<br/>\npresent it seems like everyone&#39;s needs are being met. Things can change,<br/>\nwhich is one reason why Principles work better in Unschooling, than rules or<br/>\ndictates.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time you feel the urge to control a choice, you can ask yourself<br/>\n&quot;why?&quot; and begin to question the assumptions (or fears) about children,<br/>\nparenting, learning and living joyfully that you are holding on to. <br/>\n<br/>\nIntentions matter. Guidance offered from the place of partnership and Trust<br/>\nhas a different feeling, avoids rebellion, and is just plain less focused on<br/>\nthe trivial. Guidance means optional acceptance instead of mandatory<br/>\ncompliance. Guidance means parents being safety nets, not trap doors or<br/>\nexaminers. Guidance facilitates mindfulness. Directives shut it down, and<br/>\nmay even foster resentment instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of Unschooling is for parents to be the facilitators of options,<br/>\nthe openers of doors, the creators of environments of freedom, and the<br/>\nguardians of choice, not the installers of roadblocks and barriers.<br/>\nUnschoolers are making the huge and wonderful choice to renounce our legal<br/>\nentitlements to be the authoritarian controllers of our children&#39;s lives,<br/>\nand instead choose to be their partners.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Of course we offer guidelines. It&#39;s not a free for all &lt;NO LIMITS EVER&gt; kind of life. It&#39;s more a journey towards eliminating thoughtless restrictions and arbitrary rules. I believe unschooling is about Trusting in the natural process of learnng. It&#39;s about providing a rich, interesting, safe and nurturing home in which children are free to explore, ask questions and pursue interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we question the necessity of a structured school life, many of us have also questioned  the other childrearing &quot;rules&quot; we were taught. Many of us are questioning the way in which we ourselves were brought up. We question the need for strict and inflexible chores, bedtimes, dinnertimes, etc. In doing so, we have seen the benefit of not placing arbitrary restrictions on things like TV or sweet foods. But just because we don&#39;t have a &quot;no TV after noon&quot; rule doesn&#39;t mean our kids are necessarily choosing to watch TV all day, eating a diet consisting of Mallomars, Sweet Tarts and lollipops. And it doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re leaving them to their own devices all day or night to fend for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had similar evening routines to yours when my kids were little. It wasn&#39;t &quot;in bed at 9:00, tired or not!&quot; like when I was growing up. It was &quot;Let&#39;s get our jammies on and have a snack. Let&#39;s read a book and snuggle. We&#39;re all getting tired, time for night, night.&quot; I wasn&#39;t the enforcer of the bedtime rule, I was helping my kids settle in for what I knew was their approximate sleep time. We had routines and they worked for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like your family is working as a team. That&#39;s good. And it&#39;s very cool that you were unschooled yourself.

I can tell immediately when I&#39;ve crossed into the coercion  zone.  Some <br/>\nchildren are so compliant, that they&#39;ll do just about anything  mom says, even <br/>\nif it goes against their own wishes and needs.   <br/>\n <br/>\nAn unschooling friend of mine asks herself the question &quot;does this  make <br/>\nsense?&quot;  She encourages her children to do the same.  It makes  sense to go to bed <br/>\nwhen you are tired, it doesn&#39;t make sense to force a very  awake someone to <br/>\ngo to bed.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for what you *are*, does it matter?  It might if you went to a  radical <br/>\nunschooling meeting and made everyone listen to why *they* should  restrict TV, <br/>\nbedtime, etc.  But in your own life, just live and learn and  have fun!  Come <br/>\nhere to read and expand your thinking!  It is good to  examine our lives <br/>\nsometimes to see if we are doing things because that is the  &quot;right&quot; way or if it <br/>\njust because we never knew there was another way.<br/>\n <br/>\nWelcome!<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175529137,"authorName":"Donald and Sandra Winn","from":"Donald and Sandra Winn &lt;aplan4life@...&gt;","profile":"aplan4life","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New with a question or two......","postDate":"1130618855","msgId":7237,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMDI5MjA0NzM1LjkxMTM0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzMDA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRrMGdhNCtoNDYyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7233,"nextInTopic":7238,"prevInTime":7236,"nextInTime":7238,"topicId":7233,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Rebecca, We unschool in that we have no set curriculum, we don t use texts, do not have any type of learning plan other than what comes up in life everyday.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-705655382\">Rebecca,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe &quot;unschool&quot; in that we have no set curriculum, we<br/>\ndon&#39;t use texts, do not have any type of learning plan<br/>\nother than what comes up in life everyday.
