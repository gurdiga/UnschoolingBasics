Books, TV (closed captioning  is <br/>\non often here anyway - <br/>\nI read abut that here I think it was, that hearing the TV and seeing the  <br/>\nwords at the same time can be a neat way to see words in action, so I do that  <br/>\nwhen Julian wants to), movies, going places, card games, drawing...I truly feel  <br/>\nthat that aspect is the same...however, as with any situation that is above <br/>\nand  beyond the average, lol, sometimes things need to be tweaked for each  <br/>\nindividual. If you were my child, and interested in this, I&#39;d suggest hunting  <br/>\ndown other unschooled kids that are deaf too. <br/>\n<br/>\n- kyle<br/>\n <br/>\nHTH! <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288405080,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"&quot;diana jenner&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] a few questions","postDate":"1191252850","msgId":26579,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDcxMDAxMDgzNHE2MzZlZTI0N2thMGMwMjBmMzYwMzhhMDFkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJhZDYyMjE2MDcxMDAxMDMzOGo2ZTBiNTlkZnQ1NmNlMTc4YjYwOTZjZGY5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGJhZDYyMjE2MDcxMDAxMDMzOGo2ZTBiNTlkZnQ1NmNlMTc4YjYwOTZjZGY5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26575,"nextInTopic":26607,"prevInTime":26578,"nextInTime":26580,"topicId":26575,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ***In the *real world* no one pays me to do *chores* -- the dishes, vacuuming, laundry, all voluntary on my own schedule of comfort. ... ***I imagine you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2027947495\">On 10/1/07, Kyle Brooks &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anotequaltob@...\">anotequaltob@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   (i sent a similiar message by accident, it was incomplete)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hi all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; again i&#39;m only a 16 yr old kid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i have a few questions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) why doesn&#39;t paying me to do chores teach me about the real world?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***In the *real world* no one pays me to do *chores* -- the dishes,<br/>\nvacuuming, laundry, all voluntary on my own schedule of comfort.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) is making a decision for me in order to put pressure on me to go to<br/>\n&gt; college okay?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> ***I imagine you already know the answer to this question, just by how it<br/>\n&quot;feels&quot; to have decisions made for you, especially those that add pressure.<br/>\nHappy, secure, healthy lives are more at the root of unschooling; not<br/>\ncollege for college sake.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) and finally... i&#39;m deaf. if any of you unschooled me, how would you go<br/>\n&gt; about doing it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*** Unschooling works in every language!
