I do really appreciate the time everyone has taken to respond to my bike and church questions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that is adding to our business is that my 9 yr. old has decided to return to homeschooling. She chose to go to ps a year and a half ago. We have been talking about unschooling and how that is different than what we did before she went to school.  I have been telling her that it needs to be her decision, not mine.  She was seriously thinking about it for next year.  But, yesterday she decided that she wants to start right way!  It will take a few days to adjust and straighten things out with the school, but we are very excited.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy C.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43954,"nextTopicId":44000}}
