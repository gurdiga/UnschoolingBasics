Keep in mind that many of us are not<br/>\nin West Virginia so these questions may not make any sense to what you<br/>\nneed but here goes:<br/>\n1 - is there an alternate to doing a portfolio that feels okay to you?<br/>\nSome places allow testing, portfolio, or &quot;alternate evaluation&quot;<br/>\n2 - what do you mean by &quot;can&#39;t find anyone to do it&quot;? Do you mean you<br/>\ncan&#39;t find anyone to evaluate the portfolio or you can&#39;t find anyone to<br/>\nmake the portfolio for you?<br/>\n3 - does it have to be submitted by June 30th for sure? Or just at the<br/>\n&#39;end of the school year&#39;? (like I said, I don&#39;t know the details of WV<br/>\nlaw since I&#39;m in CT where there is no homeschooling law)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy limited understanding of WV laws indicates that you can either<br/>\nadminister a standardized test or you can be evaluated by a certified<br/>\nteacher. Is the &quot;can&#39;t find anyone&quot; related to not being able to find a<br/>\ncertified teacher? If so, that&#39;s something you&#39;d need to sort out with a<br/>\nlocal group or list - they&#39;re the ones who&#39;d know about people locally.<br/>\nI did a quick search for Yahoo groups using &quot;west Virginia homeschool&quot;<br/>\nand found at least half a dozen yahoo groups. I&#39;m sure some of the folks<br/>\nthere would be more than willing to help out (you might even find<br/>\nsomeone who homeschools who has kept up her/his certification in order<br/>\nto do evals).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
