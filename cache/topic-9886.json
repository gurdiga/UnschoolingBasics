I posted one negative thing, and  <br/>\nin the heat of the moment, really focused on that. I would like to  <br/>\nverify that we do not see her as flawed, and we are not constantly  <br/>\nannoyed or frustrated by her. She has a lot of great traits, and I  <br/>\nknow she is a good person. We don&#39;t focus on the stealing, and she  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get punished, lectured, etc. I can&#39;t even imagine that  <br/>\nsubconsciously we&#39;re treating her differently, because I&#39;ve always  <br/>\nassumed it was a developmental stage and that she&#39;d work through it.  <br/>\nIt is frustrating to me because I am not sure what to say or do to  <br/>\nhelp her or her siblings deal with the emotions that come along with  <br/>\nthe actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I say that she&#39;s always had traits that concern me, I mean to  <br/>\nsay that I worry that her personality will not allow her to be all or  <br/>\ndo all of which she is capable. She has always been competitive,  <br/>\nwhich is funny because no one else in our family (immediate or  <br/>\nextended) really is. My MIL was, but she died not much after Emily  <br/>\nwas born, so dh and I laugh with each other about how much she is  <br/>\nlike his mom. It is odd though, because she is 18 months younger than  <br/>\nher next older sibling, and it&#39;s always been a competition for her to  <br/>\ncatch up and get ahead of Breanna. It started with walking, talking,  <br/>\nlearning how to do anything. If she is not certain that she will be  <br/>\nbetter than anyone else she knows, she will not attempt to do or  <br/>\nlearn something. That has concerned me, not because I think it&#39;s a  <br/>\nnegative trait, but because I worry about her burning out early. She  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have fun winning, but she is extremely driven to win. The  <br/>\nstealing and lying, cheating concern me as well, because at this  <br/>\npoint, her friends and siblings don&#39;t want to play with her, and no  <br/>\none trusts her. When ever money is missing, her siblings immediately  <br/>\nblame her. Because her sister is really really great at drawing  <br/>\nlifelike things, Emily will do absolutely nothing with crayon and  <br/>\npaper. When Rachel figured out on her own how to write in cursive,  <br/>\nEmily was furious and mean to the family for days over that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my op, I asked for help for ME to deal. Not to try and change her,  <br/>\nbut to try to understand her and what I can do to help. I needed to  <br/>\nknow if there was anything I should be doing with her, or what. I  <br/>\nnever said she was flawed, I said she had traits that concern me. I  <br/>\ncan&#39;t stand the cheating and stealing anymore, so I am obviously  <br/>\nneeding help for MYSELF. I need help for her siblings, because they  <br/>\nare about to kill her. And I need ideas for how to approach her,  <br/>\nbecause obviously I&#39;m not doing a good job. It&#39;s a big step for me  <br/>\njust to admit I need help...and I thank everyone who has replied with  <br/>\ninsight and ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 7, 2006, at 9:23 PM, Ren Allen wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &quot;&gt; She&#39;s always had some personality traits that concern me, but this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is too far.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; YOu know, the more I think about this statement, the more it bothers<br/>\n&gt; me on a very deep level.<br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s ALWAYS had traits that concern you?
