Its not a method, per se, but a life-style.  It <br/>\nexends out further than just how to raise and teach a child, it&#39;s <br/>\nalso the way one lives and treats others.  With respect and <br/>\nkindness.  They same way you expect to be treated.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow... this city girl really has lots to learn!  Its only been 5 <br/>\nyears since I rejected big corporate America by ceasing to work for <br/>\nthem.  After living in the city all my life (with &quot;stuff&quot; as the <br/>\nreason for living), we moved out to the &quot;hills&quot;; not really country <br/>\nalthough there are are some cows and horses nearby.  There I gained <br/>\nmy stay-at-home status.  Then a sickly MIL came to stay with us, and <br/>\nshe&#39;s still here.  No problems there, she is the only grandparent my <br/>\nchildren have, so we really are fortunate that she plays a daily <br/>\nrole in their lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nLife makes funny turns and things we think would NEVER happen to us, <br/>\nhappen.  I didn&#39;t even know what homeschooling was about 5 years <br/>\nago.  And then I thought it was only for the religious and those <br/>\nliving too far from &quot;real&quot; schools.  What a goof I was!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe its a mid-life crisis for me, and I want to live my &quot;second&quot; <br/>\nhalf the right way after all the misrepresentations from employers, <br/>\nschools, etc.  Things don&#39;t really have to be as difficult as <br/>\neveryone would have you believe.  Maybe its God or just my growing <br/>\nup.  I was too caught up (read &quot;workaholic&quot;) in my past life to pay <br/>\nattention to my two young baby daughters (what a horrible <br/>\nconfession, huh?) and sent them away to Montesorri school as soon as <br/>\nthey were able, between 2 and 3 years of age.  Better than day-care, <br/>\nI told myself.  They were learning and preparing to be good <br/>\nstudents.  Of course, the older daughter couldn&#39;t wait to go... and <br/>\nmy younger, she just wanted to stay home.   Poor baby, maybe that is <br/>\nwhy I&#39;m so protective of her now, I wasn&#39;t emotionally or physically <br/>\nthere when she really just needed mom around.  And I see now that my <br/>\nolder daughter just was used to me NOT being around and school was <br/>\nan arena where she had attention and people who told her she did <br/>\ngood.  We still need to work on this part of our relationship, <br/>\nobviously.  She still seeks the outside approval of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I do appreciate the stories you have shared about your own <br/>\nsituations. Many have posted questions and comments that I&#39;m still <br/>\ndigesting and thinking about.  Its amazing how so many different <br/>\npeople are making the unschooling life work for them and their <br/>\nchildren.  I&#39;m not going to plunge in, but just sort of tread water <br/>\nand see how this will work for us.  I just have to remind myself to <br/>\nnot make it harder than it needs to be... didn&#39;t I say that before?  <br/>\nLOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, everyone for your heartfelt comments.

But thanks for showing me that I <br/>\ncan still have an unschooling view although I do have one still &quot;in <br/>\nschool.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to admit that two years later, I still have a very ugly view <br/>\nof public education and having a very hard time getting over it.  I <br/>\ndo bite my tongue when expressing my views (in public... lol), but <br/>\nthe damage that they caused to my younger daughter is something I&#39;m <br/>\nstill trying to undo.  When I pulled her out of of public in third <br/>\ngrade she HATED reading and writing and schools punish you for that <br/>\n(besides it goes into their permanent record).  So what do I do?  I <br/>\nbring her home and make her do school at home!  It was a little <br/>\nbetter, she enjoyed being at home and she did begin to read again <br/>\n(because of advise from other homeschooler parents to let her read <br/>\nwhat she wants).  But I always thought we&#39;d end up doing curriculum <br/>\nin a box at some point (my goal! hahaha).  She fussed and I <br/>\nthreatened for her to finish up her language arts and math <br/>\nassignments.  Then I realized, &quot;duh,&quot; that this was NOT instilling <br/>\nany type of love of learning.  Well, I now accept that this child is <br/>\nnot a &quot;in a box&quot; type of kid so I need to step back and let her <br/>\nlead, rather than force her to fit a square peg.  Which is why I am <br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t nag her or question what she watches or does right now.  I <br/>\nknow that I&#39;m still in re-training myself and need the break as much <br/>\nas she does.  It&#39;s almost sad to know that I was so mislead in all I <br/>\nthought about school and education.  I do tend to be a bit <br/>\ncontrolling, so this is a real challenge for me.  To NOT have the <br/>\nday planned out and tasks accomplished (well, not true, I do have <br/>\ntime to work on my household tasks now!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI know its still early and I can only hope that I can draw out a <br/>\nhappy little girl who knows she can do what she wants and be what <br/>\nshe wants to be without fear of what anyone will say as she grows <br/>\ninto a secure and intelligent person. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the thought provoking comments!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Patty</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":260272869,"authorName":"Tanna Griffiths","from":"Tanna Griffiths &lt;tannagriffiths@...&gt;","profile":"tannagriffiths","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling Catagories","postDate":"1175093325","msgId":22761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkyNDM5LjM0MzgyLnFtQHdlYjgyODA5Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGV1Y2JqOCtjYnJoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22760,"nextInTopic":22765,"prevInTime":22760,"nextInTime":22762,"topicId":22713,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" but I have faith that she will want to learn something at some point, right?

Specifically &quot;Tom&Jerry&quot; and &quot;Spongebob&quot;. What did they learn from it?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Well, while watching &quot;Tom&Jerry&quot; (my fav. btw) my eldest started talking about why a person&#39;s face turns red when they get angry or hang up side down, and why it turns bluish when they can&#39;t get air.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  From &quot;Spongebob&quot; (not at all my taste) my youngest wanted to learn addition because someone said 2+2=4. From that he wanted to write it and asked what 4+4 and 5+5 were. My eldest asked what Lead was (they mentioned a lead weight) so we looked it up on wikipedia because my answer wasn&#39;t satisfactory. We learned it as a element. That it is heavy. I knew that, but we also learned it was once used in candy because it has a sweet component! Wow! I hate &quot;Spongebob&quot; but I now know an interesting fact about Lead that I wouldn&#39;t have learned if my eldest hadn&#39;t asked.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So, I don&#39;t feel that one thing is more &quot;educational&quot; than another. It is more a matter of natural curiosity. My 8 y/o still asks loads of questions and he knows that I will help him find the answers. My 4 y/o just blows me away with some of the things he knows that I never &quot;taught&quot; him.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I should also mention that my eldest watches a lot of Nick and he has created extra characters for shows like &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;. He draws them and tells me their powers or characteristics and a plot that surrounds them.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So lets see. We covered Art, Language, Science, Handwriting, and Math (if you are inclined to categorize subjects) after a day of watching &quot;junk&quot; on tv. :)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  As for your original question. I started out using a curriculum, moved to that &quot;unschooling everything except...&quot; stage to child-led unit studies to radical unschooling.

Its <br/>\nOkay to watch something or do something just because its Fun! And <br/>\nonce you start being okay with that you&#39;ll have an easier time <br/>\nseeing the learning that happens naturally when people are having a <br/>\ngood time. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy stepson has a new interest.
