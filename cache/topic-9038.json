I have  <br/>\nthought about this and it&#39;s the reason I&#39;m not &quot;making&quot; her get out of that  <br/>\nschool. The other day when the school said she was going to be moved to the  other <br/>\nteam she was hysterically crying. She didn&#39;t think it was right, that she  <br/>\nhas to &quot;change&quot; her whole life for this teacher, and that the teacher should  <br/>\nhave been fired. I explained that this is the school&#39;s decision, they&#39;re not  <br/>\ngoing to penalize the teacher for the things she&#39;s done, and the only thing  <br/>\nNicholle (my daughter) can do is stay there and move to the new team, stay  home <br/>\nfor either home schooling or unschooling, or move to another school (we  have <br/>\nschool choice here). She was not for either home schooling idea, and I  didn&#39;t <br/>\npush it. I&#39;ve given her the choices, explained thoroughly what she can  <br/>\nexpect from each choice, and express my opinion without giving her a permanent  <br/>\ndecision from me. However, we have come to the conclusion that if she doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nmake it into a votech school for high school next year than she will finish her  <br/>\nschooling at home. There&#39;s just no way she&#39;ll make it through a full day&#39;s <br/>\nworth  of schooling in the higher grades, even her teachers this year have said <br/>\nthis.  So, this is the reason I&#39;m still researching all of our possibilities, <br/>\nlearning  from all of you ladies here, learning the laws, and basically <br/>\nanything else I  can research. Anyways, thank you ladies for all of the good <br/>\ninformation and  support that you give me here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nBeth<br/>\nmother to Nikki and Kayla<br/>\nand always thinking of  Brian<br/>\nsince his sunset on  09/07/05<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9037,"nextTopicId":9039}}
