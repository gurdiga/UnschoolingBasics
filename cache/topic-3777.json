In fact my xh left for a 2 week business trip when our youngest was 3 weeks old.  Somehow through all that they have always stayed connected.  When Dan is home he is quite involved with the children.  He&#39;s always given them baths, changed diapers, held them, carried them in the slings and front packs, taken them to the parks, helped them learn things, etc.  When he has been gone for a week or more he calls them and talks to them each day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy end has been harder.  Having to be &quot;on&quot; 24/7 for long stretches of time.  It is a bit easier now that they are older and I can escape for an hour or so to go do &quot;my time&quot; things.  I stamp once a month and go to Curves (when I get around to it) or run to the store to pick up a few items.  Sunday&#39;s are usually &quot;my day&quot; where I go do the weekly shopping, have a cup of tea somewhere (usually Starbucks), and read the paper.  When the kids were younger it was harder because I couldn&#39;t leave them at all much less for an hour.  There were days I just wanted to scream for some alone time.  What I found is that I would stay up later than I normally would.  I&#39;m naturally a morning person and wake at 6am at the latest.  I enjoy mornings, but in order to get some &quot;me time&quot; I found I had to stay up later and live off less sleep.  (Not recommended during the post partum period LOL!)  But it afforded me the time to stamp, scrapbook, and read undisturbed.  It helped.  I had to learn to cope with less sleep as a trade-off to having time to unwind and relax.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] A new unschooler is born","postDate":"1098261875","msgId":3836,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDE5MTMzNjA3LjE3MTU1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxOTA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3829,"nextInTopic":3837,"prevInTime":3835,"nextInTime":3837,"topicId":3777,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" My dh had been separated from us for about a month on a couple","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-245796725\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Any one have a dh that is gone for periods of time?

How exciting!  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh has traveled frequently since we before we had kids.  Right now he<br/>\ntends to be gone for three weeks and home for  1-3 weeks.  One of the<br/>\nbenefits of this type of work schedule is that when he is home, he is home<br/>\nall day.  We get to spend a lot of time together when he is here.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t really have any advice to offer.  It&#39;s just something you get used<br/>\nto.  I think that we actually talk more this way because he calls every<br/>\nnight and we all sum up our days for each other.  The kids really look<br/>\nforward to talking with him and so do I.  One piece of advice I would offer<br/>\nis that when he is home, don&#39;t stop all of your routines trying to include<br/>\nhim.  It seems to work better if we keep our regular routines and let him<br/>\nknow he is welcome to join us or not.  It took me a while to figure that<br/>\nout.  It wasn&#39;t until I started doing this that the transition of coming and<br/>\ngoing became easier.  It used to be more difficult taking 2 days for us to<br/>\nreadjust to him being home or being gone.  (Or maybe the kids just got older<br/>\nand so it got easier.  They are now 8 and 9.75 and it&#39;s all they&#39;ve ever<br/>\nknown.)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you feel overwhelmed I think someone&#39;s idea to get a mother&#39;s helper is a<br/>\ngood one.  I never really felt the need to, but I only have two children.<br/>\nJust don&#39;t expect too much from yourself.  Some days we still don&#39;t get<br/>\ndressed or I wish the lawn was mowed 3 days ago, but it&#39;s not important in<br/>\nthe big picture.  I find it easier to cook too because the kids would rather<br/>\ngraze anyway, for the most part.  Sometimes we just have mashed potatoes for<br/>\nsupper.  But it all works out in the long run.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela ~ Maine<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150688296,"authorName":"Kiersten Pasciak","from":"&quot;Kiersten Pasciak&quot; &lt;kjl8@...&gt;","profile":"kierstenpasciak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Boys and the toilet","postDate":"1098212781","msgId":3822,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNsM29qZCs4cTFqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNsM25iMyt2MjViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3818,"nextInTopic":3824,"prevInTime":3821,"nextInTime":3823,"topicId":3777,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On the little boy/potty issue, we just used a plastic potty at first (kinda like the coffee can idea) and kept it in whatever room we were in.

(I was on the bed sideways and she wanted me at the end of the bed with my butt hanging off the mattress, and she kept trying to pull me where she wanted me).<br/>\n<br/>\n~Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nvote.yahoo.com - Register online to vote today!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92643757,"authorName":"Leslie530@aol.com","from":"Leslie530@...","profile":"lescather","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] A new unschooler is born","postDate":"1098195504","msgId":3791,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5ZC4yYWRlZWMwMC4yZWE2N2MzMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3790,"nextInTopic":3808,"prevInTime":3790,"nextInTime":3792,"topicId":3777,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/19/2004 9:38:40 AM Eastern Daylight Time, elfmama_2@yahoo.com writes: Any one  have a dh that is gone for periods of time?

With a newborn, you are doing this already!  Is  there <br/>\nsomeone that can help you with housework or feeding the kids?  (I  never did, but <br/>\nthought I would ask!)  Is there a neighbor or a 10 YO that  might want to come <br/>\nover for a few dollars to play with the older kids?<br/>\n <br/>\nTry to have as many easy meals around as possible, less cooking and less  <br/>\ncleanup.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids always liked to get out almost every day to do something.   Even a <br/>\nride in the car or a walk around the block gave us a change of  pace.<br/>\n <br/>\nSince it is the holidays, you may need to warn the extended family that you  <br/>\nwill be doing just the minimum this year, and that means caring for your  <br/>\nchildren.  You might have to say &quot;no&quot; or &quot;maybe&quot; alot.  When you have  the time <br/>\nand energy to do more, you will.  If I got invitations to things,  I would say <br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t know if I could come, it would just depend on the  day.  Most <br/>\npeople understood this.<br/>\n <br/>\nConsider this an adventure, not a chore.  And prepare your husband for  you <br/>\nto need alot of rest when he is home, and that he might need to  take over the <br/>\ncare and feeding of everybody for those days.  It is as much  of an emotional <br/>\ndrain to do this as a physical one.  Rest up while he is  home.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78615010,"authorName":"mamaaj2000","from":"&quot;mamaaj2000&quot; &lt;mamaaj2000@...&gt;","profile":"mamaaj2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: A new unschooler is born","postDate":"1098195314","msgId":3790,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNsMzdoaStoaGk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDE5MTMzNjA3LjE3MTU1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxOTA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3784,"nextInTopic":3791,"prevInTime":3789,"nextInTime":3791,"topicId":3777,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... center, my midwife didn t make it, and a VERY startled and unprepared (for natural childbirth) resident ended up attending the birth. :^) Oh, I have a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1775192409\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rebecca DeLong <br/>\n&lt;elfmama_2@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 45 min after labor started, 15 min after we got to the birthing <br/>\n </span></blockquote>center, my midwife didn&#39;t make it, and a VERY startled and unprepared<br/>\n(for natural childbirth) resident ended up attending the birth. :^)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I have a wonderful mental image of that!

I was just adding up how much dh has been <br/>\ngone lately...5 weeks out of the last 5 months, so I&#39;m getting a <br/>\ntaste of it. Most of the time it&#39;s been for one week at a time, so <br/>\nthat&#39;s not too bad. <br/>\n<br/>\nDh stocks the fridge and freezer with lots of easy to cook food--<br/>\nokay, some of it is &#39;easy to defrost&#39; food! Showering has been nearly <br/>\nimpossible this week...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main mental difference for me is that instead of trying to get a <br/>\nbunch of stuff done quickly while dh plays with the kids, I try to <br/>\nstretch out &#39;chores&#39; so that we all enjoy them. Instead of dh picking <br/>\nup the mail when he comes home, the kids and I go get it, which means <br/>\ndd (1.5) takes the key and spends 15 minutes refusing to open the <br/>\nmailbox. We talk to neighbors, we end up taking the mail for a little <br/>\nwalk, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe might make 2-3 trips to the store for a few items and take our <br/>\ntime, looking at fruit we&#39;re not familiar with or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh shoot, some of you do this all the time, right? Maybe I need to <br/>\npretend dh isn&#39;t available more of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey aren&#39;t chores, they&#39;re life, so enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are taking the kids on more errands as they get older. Ds (4) is <br/>\nreally good company. Dd is great on some outings, but gets frustrated <br/>\nwith others. Dh even survived taking both of them to the store last <br/>\nweek, poor ol&#39; introvert! They came home with a frightening amount of <br/>\ncandy, but that&#39;s okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n--aj, helping herself more than helping Rebecca!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163221353,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;zoocrew@...&gt;","profile":"tina010871","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: A new unschooler is born","postDate":"1098193289","msgId":3784,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNsMzVpOSs0cDcyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDE5MTMzNjA3LjE3MTU1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxOTA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3782,"nextInTopic":3790,"prevInTime":3783,"nextInTime":3785,"topicId":3777,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Congrats on your new arrival!
