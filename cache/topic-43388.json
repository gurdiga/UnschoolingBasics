She has lots and lots of baby dolls. She has lots and lots of bouncy balls. Going into stores meant being comfortable with hanging out there for a long time and seeing if there was something we could afford that she wanted. It helped not to go into stores when I was hungry or tired or grouchy. Going to thrift stores helped. Going to garage sales helped. It helped, a lot, to give her an allowance. The allowance was probably the biggest help. It didn&#39;t stop me from buying her something if I wanted to, but it did stop me from making a judgement about how my money was going to be spent because it was now her money. Sometimes it was really hard. It helped to actually look at how much she was spending on things and to really budget for her desire to acquire. Having David there to pick up the pieces when I felt overwhelmed by how much she needed was amazing. We were<br/>\n at the Singapore airport once and she really, really wanted to buy a pair of Chinese pajamas and I couldn&#39;t do it. We were on our way back from spending to much in Australia and I just couldn&#39;t spend more money. So, seeing that it was a good thing, a rare opportunity, David went with her and they bought these beautiful pajamas. That helped, too, seeing the joy she could find in the things she bought. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt 9, she&#39;s a more discerning shopper than I was up through my 20s and into my 30s. She doesn&#39;t have that same kind of emotional attachment to buying something that I can feel at times. If I get this thing I am loved, sort of approach. Helping her to get the things she wanted when she was 5, helping her to go out and explore the world of shopping has made her much more thrifty than I would have thought. And interestingly, she has more money saved at the moment than her brother does. Simon never really went through a period of wanting to buy so much. He&#39;s fairly steady in his spending. But Linnaea, who went through a period of really wanting to buy that we supported (with only occasional failings on my part), seems to be able to save more than Simon. I was at the store the other day with Linnaea trying to get her to buy something with my money and she just didn&#39;t want anything. Nothing was good enough to justify the expense. That said, Simon doesn&#39;t often<br/>\n want me to buy anything for him, either. It&#39;s very odd to go shopping with two children who are so good at understanding value that they don&#39;t buy things unless they really want them. <br/>\n<br/>\nTry and figure out ways to work within your budget. If your town has a Saturday market, go there, go to garage sales, those are so much fun, I miss garage sales, go to thrift stores, go to a toy store and just sit and play with the stuff and explore and talk about things. See it as a museum trip. Go to auctions and see if you can buy a toy lot for not much money. Explore the world of purchasing. If that&#39;s what he wants to do, go with it. Absolutely have a budget, but don&#39;t see it as wasting money. See it as supporting his interest. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 5 yr old son has been into buying toys for over a year. I have tried to get over my own issues of wasting money to help him get what he wants. At the same time, we can&#39;t go on a shopping spree every day. I have a problem figuring out what to buy without a budget. I&#39;ve tried all different things with him. I&#39;ve gone into namebrand stores and let him pick out any toy regardless of price. If he wants lots of toys, I try to take him to the thriftstore. It doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference. The more I take him, the more he wants to go. There may be an underlying need for him, but I don&#39;t know what it is. Maybe I&#39;m not paying enough attention to him or something, but I&#39;m not sure.  Yesterday I had two appointments.

That way I could say, just before we got out of the car to go into each store &quot;the budget is such-and-such&quot;. If she wanted something that cost a little more, we&#39;d talk about that and figure out where the money could come from. If it was at the first store of the trip, then it was usually a simple matter of spending less at the next stop. If it was the last (or only) store, there would be different options. Maybe I could finagle an extra few dollars out of the budget. Maybe I could put back something I was buying for me.
