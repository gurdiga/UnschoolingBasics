And we do not know the dangers of excessive TV watching, either - of course, nor do we know the long-term dangers of anything, really. <br/>\n <br/>\nBut that&#39;s not the issue - we could spend all day arguing about whether TV is good or bad, harmful or helpful. The real question is whether or not we, as unschooling parents, should arbitrarily use our own values and fears about things top judge what is right for our children, or should we instead focus our efforts on helping them listen to their bodies and hearts so that they can make their own decisions? We can assume that TV is harmful; we can assume that they can learn without it; and we can control what they watch or how much they watch. But what is the result? A child who grows up viewing the world through our eyes, instead of having the freedom to develop their own view of the world. If you do what you&#39;ve always done, you&#39;ll get what you&#39;ve always gotten - so if we pass down our judgments about what our kids should and shouldn&#39;t do, they&#39;ll likely grow up believing whatever they hear, and we will end up with a generation very much like our own.<br/>\n Maybe that&#39;s a good thing, but I want more for my kids - I want them to see the world for the possibilities and potential it has, which means they need the tools to develop their own judgment and belief systems. So if they want to stay up all night watching Family Guy, let &#39;em do it - because that will help them decide for themselves what is good and bad, too much or too little. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Wed, 5/13/09, DJ250 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dj250@...\">dj250@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: DJ250 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dj250@...\">dj250@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] tv<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Wednesday, May 13, 2009, 6:39 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a traditionally- homeschooling friend who asked &quot;But, tv hasn&#39;t been around that long, we don&#39;t know it&#39;s long-term effects.

I answered that Andy has never asked to watch an R movie but if he did, we&#39;d watch it if he wanted to.  K didn&#39;t know what to say next.
