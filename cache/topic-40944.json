I was reading the comments and thinking that y&#39;all can come to<br/>\nour homeschooling group any day!  One of our families have little ones<br/>\nwho speek in (let&#39;s call them the Smiths) Smith-ese.  This is more than<br/>\nsimply switching words around, it sounds very much like someone with a<br/>\nREALLY thick accent who is on their third language.  When the children<br/>\nreach 6-8 they begin talking in what I would call regular-ese.  The<br/>\nfamily has many children; they have all gone through the Smith-ese<br/>\nstage, and the ones who are over 8 speak normally.  We have learned to<br/>\nadapt to the &quot;dialect&quot; and if I can&#39;t understand one of the kids, I ask<br/>\nan older sibling to translate.  It works out, no one is shamed, and no<br/>\none is corrected.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI love to watch these folks be totally supportive of all their kids, and<br/>\nthey have shown me how to be more supportive of my own! <br/>\n <br/>\nblessings and peace,<br/>\nQuinn Blaiklock, Maine<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://toolbar.Care2.com&quot;&gt;http://toolbar.Care2.com&lt;/a&gt;  Make your computer carbon-neutral (free).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Care2.com&quot;&gt;http://www.Care2.com&lt;/a&gt; Green Living, Human Rights and more - 8 million members!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40915,"nextTopicId":40974}}
