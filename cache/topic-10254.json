They&#39;re out there you know. Open yourself up to the<br/>\nuniverse, trust that you will find the people you are meant to find<br/>\nand it will happen.<br/>\nThey might not be unschoolers, but they will honor your unschooling<br/>\njourney.:)  They will be curious, passionate, joyful people that will<br/>\nenrich your life. They are out there, waiting to connect with you at<br/>\njust the right moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor now, try to limit contact with people that re-open old wounds.<br/>\nUntil you&#39;re strong enough to not let it affect you, be very, very<br/>\ncareful about the amount of time and what events you choose to attend<br/>\nwith negative people. None would be best, but I also understand trying<br/>\nto keep family communication open.<br/>\nLimit the conversations. Change the subject if it gets too close for<br/>\ncomfort. I&#39;ve found the best method of deflection is to ask someone a<br/>\nquestion about themselves, preferably one that lets them share what<br/>\nthey enjoy or like to brag about.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind that well of peace within you. Try to remember the perfection<br/>\nthat is YOU...that place of accepting what IS, and who you are right<br/>\nnow. Where you are, is simply where you are. You can&#39;t be anywhere<br/>\nelse but right here, right now.<br/>\nWhatever wounds you carry, that&#39;s all part of the<br/>\nright-here-right-now.  It&#39;s all ok. Be ok with all of that and make an<br/>\nagreement with yourself to not push the healing process. It is<br/>\nhappening constantly, as you question and ponder and grow. It is<br/>\nhappening as you trust your children and learn to find the joy in the<br/>\nsimple moments. It is happening as your awareness and mindfulness grows.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs YOU grow, the wounds will seem smaller and less significant. So<br/>\ndon&#39;t focus on the hurt or pain, just focus on the joy and<br/>\ngrowth....soon it will be enough to diminish all that hurt to the<br/>\npoint that you feel strong and brave and unable to get beat down.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the mean time, protect yourself.

There are different kinds of<br/>\n&quot;good&quot; in the writing world.

Still doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nCasey was 18 months old when she started learning her letters and three when she started writing and she wrote a lot. Still does. <br/>\nHer first writing was because she wanted to write a note to her best friend next door. She asked me how to make the letters to write each word she wanted in her note. I described verbally to her how the letters were formed. She put them sort of in order but kind of all over the page. You really had to work to find the words. &lt;g&gt; She just kept at it because she desparately wanted to write. Much more than she wanted to learn to read. She&#39;s still more of a writer than a reader although she reads plenty.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater she moved on to inventive spelling. She was writing so much and asking for so much spelling that I explained she could write the words as they sounded and people would still be able to read it. This really freed her up and she wrote a series of stories like that. She was 5 almost 6 then. Although she could sound out words and do some sight reading, I wouldn&#39;t say she was a real reader till about 8 or 9.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary, unschooling mom to Conor (16) and Casey (12)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>\n                            ~Ren Allen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94040812,"authorName":"Lisa H","from":"&quot;Lisa H&quot; &lt;Lmanathome@...&gt;","profile":"lmanathome","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] writing or reading","postDate":"1141169908","msgId":10320,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEwNi1EQVY1OEYyM0VERTA3MzdCNzA0MDg5QzJEMUY3MEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwNTQwMWM2M2NhYyQ5MThmN2ZlMCRmNTUyZjdhNUBob21lY3B1MjAwNjAxMD4gPDcwNDc1OTVCLUQxQTQtNDlDMy04RDVELTk2Mjg2Q0U3NTlEQUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8MzE2NkIyOTUtMThGMi00OEFBLUE5MjEtMjg1MTgyOTI3RTkwQGRpZXJhdWVyLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":10319,"nextInTopic":10331,"prevInTime":10319,"nextInTime":10321,"topicId":10254,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" From the early scribblings of a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-110675149\">&lt;&lt;Joyce (or others): What does it look like when a kid writes before  <br/>\nthey read?

That is the point of writing, to communicate  ideas.  Not all of <br/>\nus can be poets or bestselling authors, that is a gift,  not unlike an <br/>\narchitect&#39;s visual gifts.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband is not a strong writer and he does have to write frequently for  <br/>\nhis work.  He&#39;s been through several writing courses (he&#39;s military, part  of <br/>\nthe job to have this continued education).  He struggles through these  <br/>\ncourses, barely passing them.  The interesting thing is that as his  personal editor, <br/>\nI get to see writing from many of his co-workers and about half  of them can <br/>\nwrite and the other half can barely form sentences.  They were  all schooled <br/>\nand some of them went to prestigious colleges, and they all have to  take these <br/>\nwriting courses every few years.  Some of the important  documents just limp <br/>\nalong until they get put on someone&#39;s desk that can correct  them.  I have <br/>\nrewritten dozens of letters and requests of some of the men  that work under my <br/>\nhusband.  They can be so poorly written that I have no  idea what they even <br/>\nasking for!<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I worked, there was always someone in the office that was a gifted  <br/>\nwriter.  Anything important was always run by that person.<br/>\n <br/>\nEven schooled people are not necessarily good writers.  In fact, most  people <br/>\nI&#39;ve been around in the working world were barely functional  writers.  But <br/>\nthey knew it and got help when it was needed.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut I think children today have a great advantage over our  generation.  They <br/>\nactually use the written word on the computer in their  day-to-day <br/>\ncommunications!  I think the extent of my non-assignment writing  as a child was passing <br/>\nnotes in class.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooling does not mean ONLY learning from your parents.  When your  child <br/>\nhas need for more than you can provide, you will be able to find someone  who <br/>\ncan.

There&#39;s the ability to physically form letters and words on paper, the skill of typing, the flair of telling a good story, the technique of putting together an editorial, etc. Some people are more drawn to one type of communicating than another.

I belong to a few yahoo <br/>\ngroups but - they are pretty mainstream homeschoolers.  There are <br/>\nall these - comments and opinions about how &quot;they&quot; learn and the <br/>\nbest way to teach them.  Sometimes I really wonder if I do need to <br/>\ndo something different with her.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t really know why I wonder so much because although she is <br/>\ndelayed she really is moving along and I see her learning all the <br/>\ntime, and figuring things out in her own way and in her own time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I have yammered on long enough.  I look forward to reading and <br/>\nmeeting everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10430,"nextTopicId":10465}}
