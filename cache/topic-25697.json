If you have a want,<br/>\nyou can post it on there, and you might find someone<br/>\nwilling to part with what you need.  There are also<br/>\nlots of things offered on the website too.  Hope this<br/>\nhelps some.  Sounds like you are in for lots of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Kendrah Nilsestuen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:carebear-79@...\">carebear-79@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I got three replies to my question and wanted to<br/>\n&gt; take the time to  <br/>\n&gt; respond to everyone who responded to me, I&#39;ll just<br/>\n&gt; do it in this one  <br/>\n&gt; email:)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Melissa wrote<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;We (ok, me, dh kind of<br/>\n&gt; came home and said &quot;Bored today?&quot;) cut a hole in the<br/>\n&gt; wall between so<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s a doorway of sorts between the two<br/>\n&gt; (actually, it&#39;s more like<br/>\n&gt; a hobbit hole).&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fun!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Everyone has a computer in their room, it was<br/>\n&gt; worth<br/>\n&gt; the money (haha, we bought them at university<br/>\n&gt; overflow sales for way<br/>\n&gt; cheap) so that everyone had the opportunity to<br/>\n&gt; play.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good Idea. I&#39;ll have to keep my eye out for<br/>\n&gt; something like this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;It&#39;s kind of nice, keeps things interesting.<br/>\n&gt; Why not move her kitchen and craft stuff to the<br/>\n&gt; basement? Our<br/>\n&gt; basement is kind of kid&#39;s zone, definitely all about<br/>\n&gt; the kids.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Certainly a possibility to consider. Thanks for the<br/>\n&gt; input on how your  <br/>\n&gt; house is set up Melissa. I&#39;m trying to figure out<br/>\n&gt; the best way to do  <br/>\n&gt; it with two kiddos, couldn&#39;t imagine it with seven!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lisa wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I kind of think of my entire house as an<br/>\n&gt; unschooling pantry and make<br/>\n&gt; sure it&#39;s stocked with interesting things all the<br/>\n&gt; time. I sort of<br/>\n&gt; drift during the day to various areas to see what<br/>\n&gt; they are doing, they<br/>\n&gt; drift back and forth as they need me or need<br/>\n&gt; something they can&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; find.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes I love this its definitely what I&#39;m trying to<br/>\n&gt; achieve.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I think if you were to walk into any unschooler&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; home you would find<br/>\n&gt; something different. The beauty of unschooling just<br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling in general is that each person can do<br/>\n&gt; what works for<br/>\n&gt; them and their family.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, I realize this. I thought I&#39;d ask to get input<br/>\n&gt; on how other&#39;s do  <br/>\n&gt; it. But of course ultimately it is what works best<br/>\n&gt; for us. I think I  <br/>\n&gt; know what I plan to do, and if it doesn&#39;t work, we<br/>\n&gt; can always change  <br/>\n&gt; it up till it does!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Marcia wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;A mindset that EVERYTHING is of value ....and to<br/>\n&gt; overlook clutter  <br/>\n&gt; of projects<br/>\n&gt; in the making ( a creative mess is better than tidy<br/>\n&gt; idleness...and  <br/>\n&gt; process is<br/>\n&gt; more important then product &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I straighten at least once a day. I can&#39;t stand not<br/>\n&gt; being able to  <br/>\n&gt; find things, and spending a lot of my life searching<br/>\n&gt; for things, so I  <br/>\n&gt; do like to keep a moderately tidy home. However,<br/>\n&gt; this did strike me  <br/>\n&gt; as it makes me realize maybe I shouldn&#39;t be cleaning<br/>\n&gt; up everything so  <br/>\n&gt; soon. For example, sometimes my dd likes to pretend<br/>\n&gt; to go grocery  <br/>\n&gt; shopping. She&#39;ll pull out our tote bags and her<br/>\n&gt; grocery cart and go  <br/>\n&gt; to the pantry. She&#39;ll fill up the cart and ring up<br/>\n&gt; her groceries and  <br/>\n&gt; bag them. Then she leaves them on the floor and<br/>\n&gt; moves on to something  <br/>\n&gt; else. Then I put it all back. Maybe next time I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; leave them for a  <br/>\n&gt; little while to see if she wants to come back to<br/>\n&gt; them. Maybe she&#39;ll  <br/>\n&gt; want to put things away in *her* kitchen. Maybe<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;ll want to return  <br/>\n&gt; a defective item to the store clerk (usually me).<br/>\n&gt; Maybe she&#39;ll want  <br/>\n&gt; to cook a meal with what she bought. Or maybe she&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; be done with it  <br/>\n&gt; and not give a care if I put the things back. I<br/>\n&gt; could at least give  <br/>\n&gt; her the opportunity to decide though:)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks everyone,<br/>\n&gt; Kendrah<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   Vanessa  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nLuggage?
