Or is it more about a<br/>\nchange in how you look at each situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t ever HAVE to do *anything*. Each and every decision we make <br/>\ncan be a choice. It IS a choice. We can choose to be generous, <br/>\ntrusting, patient, kind, curious, and respectful. Or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is certainly a change in perspective. A paradigm shift. It&#39;s about <br/>\nconsidering *why* we would choose to say &quot;no.&quot; Is it because it&#39;s what <br/>\nwas told to us? Why? What will it hurt? What&#39;s another option? How can <br/>\nwe *make* it work?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can give me a good reason to punish my children and proof that <br/>\nit works, maybe I&#39;ll start punishing them. I haven&#39;t found a good <br/>\nreason.<br/>\n<br/>\nRewards happen naturally. I don&#39;t need to come up with some rewards <br/>\n&quot;system&quot; to get my kids to do things. If they want to do something, I <br/>\nfigure learning that thing is reward enough. What would I &quot;reward&quot; them <br/>\n*for*? That whole Pizza Hut reading program simply pisses me off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t say we don&#39;t ever praise. It just probably looks a little <br/>\ndifferent. Cameron has asked to make supper. Every night. Cool. Tonight <br/>\nhe&#39;s in there pounding chicken and stuffing it with basil and cheese. <br/>\nHe&#39;ll pour a white cream sauce over the top and serve it with <br/>\nbruschetta and a salad. If it&#39;s good, I&#39;ll damn well tell him! &lt;G&gt; <br/>\nDuncan just got to level ten with a new WoW character last night. When <br/>\nhe told us he got a new pet for reaching that level, we all said <br/>\n&quot;COOL!&quot; We were excited *for* him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m genuinely thrilled when they are pleased with what they accomplish. <br/>\nI have no problem telling them so. But it&#39;s not empty praise so that I <br/>\ncan get them to do things---or to encourage &quot;good behavior&quot; or <br/>\nanything. It&#39;s real and no more or less than I would give to my husband <br/>\nor a friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Alfie Kohn","postDate":"1207771812","msgId":31702,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ0ajdyNCtjbmJlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA0MDkwMjAxdTZkNjQ1NWFhdjQ5MzM4OTNmOTAzZTA3OTlAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":31693,"nextInTopic":31704,"prevInTime":31701,"nextInTime":31703,"topicId":31687,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... do not ... this ... parent, ... about a ...
