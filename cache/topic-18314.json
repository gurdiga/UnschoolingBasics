Sometimes when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I read it, I actually have the thought enter my<br/>\n&gt; mind that I wish my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; boys could go to a boarding school where they<br/>\n&gt; could have these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; adventures and I could live out my fantasy of<br/>\n&gt; being Mrs. Weasley and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spend my days knitting sweaters. But then I<br/>\n&gt; realize that if Hogwarts<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were indeed real, there would be drugs along with<br/>\n&gt; all the bullying,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; etc., and I would miss my boys.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that bullying can happen in any setting and<br/>\n&gt; have seen it<br/>\n&gt; happen even in an unschooling setting :( yet, I see<br/>\n&gt; Hogwarts as being<br/>\n&gt; different from traditional schools. Aside from<br/>\n&gt; History of Magic<br/>\n&gt; (snore) everything that they learn is stuff that<br/>\n&gt; they are going to use<br/>\n&gt; when they get into their adult lives. As witches and<br/>\n&gt; wizards they<br/>\n&gt; need to know how to use potions, how to charm a<br/>\n&gt; teapot into pouring<br/>\n&gt; itself (heck, I would if I could LOL!), and how to<br/>\n&gt; defend oneself<br/>\n&gt; against the evils of dark arts. The first few years<br/>\n&gt; is a general over<br/>\n&gt; view of the magical world, but, as we have seen, one<br/>\n&gt; can choose not to<br/>\n&gt; take some courses or to take alternative courses to<br/>\n&gt; the norm (Hermione<br/>\n&gt; taking arithmancy and not taking divination.) And<br/>\n&gt; after the OWL&#39;s one<br/>\n&gt; really starts honing in on the subjects that they<br/>\n&gt; want to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The magical community is much different from the<br/>\n&gt; Muggle. Jo Rowling<br/>\n&gt; was asked once where the kids learned to read and do<br/>\n&gt; math because they<br/>\n&gt; never seemed to be in math or grammar classes and<br/>\n&gt; her reply was that<br/>\n&gt; most young witches and wizards are homeschooled.<br/>\n&gt; Can&#39;t you just see<br/>\n&gt; Molly Weasley unschooling her crew? :-D Another<br/>\n&gt; thought (as if the<br/>\n&gt; HP world was real LOL!) is that Hogwarts truly is<br/>\n&gt; the safest place for<br/>\n&gt; children to learn magic and be protected until they<br/>\n&gt; can protect<br/>\n&gt; themselves. With characters like Voldemort (oh get<br/>\n&gt; over it, Ron)<br/>\n&gt; hanging about and knowing that he has powers that<br/>\n&gt; even the most<br/>\n&gt; talented of magical folks can&#39;t compete against, I<br/>\n&gt; think that I would<br/>\n&gt; prefer my child to be as safe as possible under the<br/>\n&gt; care of Dumbledore<br/>\n&gt; (et al) and all its magical protections.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We are HUGE HP fans here. We have a party every year<br/>\n&gt; when the newest<br/>\n&gt; movie comes out. We dress in costumes, eat wizarding<br/>\n&gt; food (Bertie<br/>\n&gt; Botts, skiving snack boxes, pumpkin pasties,<br/>\n&gt; butterbeer, chocolate<br/>\n&gt; frogs (we make them ourselves), and lemondrops),<br/>\n&gt; watch all the movies<br/>\n&gt; that have already been released, have trivia<br/>\n&gt; competitions (is there an<br/>\n&gt; HP Trivial Pursuit?), and then go to the midnight<br/>\n&gt; showing of the<br/>\n&gt; newest movie. We go to book release parties (in<br/>\n&gt; costume) and win<br/>\n&gt; prizes (I have a Hogwart&#39;s t-shirt that says<br/>\n&gt; Professor on the back)<br/>\n&gt; and quote from the books all the time. We are<br/>\n&gt; constantly arguing over<br/>\n&gt; what is going to happen and challenging our memories<br/>\n&gt; to defend<br/>\n&gt; different points of view.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Michelle - who really wishes that the wizarding<br/>\n&gt; world of JK Rowling was real<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
