I&#39;ve treated it as such, but maybe this is a joke and I didn&#39;t get it the first time. If you aren&#39;t joking,  it is not a good way to unschool, to choose to cloister your children with only the knowledge that you think is appropriate. Unschooling is about making the world more accessible, about finding and exploring more and more and sharing and feeding in lots and lots of potential sources of information. <br/>\nIf Simon or Linnaea came home from anything saying they wanted more, I would make that happen. I would buy a tv, if we didn&#39;t have one, I would rent videos, I would find and supply many, many things.  Whatever it was, really. I would never cut off the supply of information. In fact, given a slight competitive nature, I would research the heck out of what it was they wanted and try and be as good as their other source, maybe. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: looking for feedback","postDate":"1222802140","msgId":36290,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NEFFMTUxQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":36289,"nextInTopic":36291,"prevInTime":36289,"nextInTime":36291,"topicId":36254,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Older dr. who episodes are available on DVD from Netflix - you could watch them on your computer if it can handle playing DVDs.

Also had a performance of Romeo and<br/>\n&gt; Juliet that was fun - the company was just 6 or 7 people, mixed male<br/>\n&gt; and female. At the start of the show, they went into the audience with<br/>\n&gt; a bag. In the bag were slips of paper with the names of the various<br/>\n&gt; characters writ on them. Some had multiple names (for characters with<br/>\n&gt; smaller roles). Each actor had to perform whatever role(s) the person<br/>\n&gt; drew for them - so a big burly guy ended up being Juliet&#39;s nurse and a<br/>\n&gt; lovely blonde young lady ended up being Romeo&#39;s father and so on. Every<br/>\n&gt; performance, the roles changed - EVERY player had to know EVERY part,<br/>\n&gt; how&#39;s that for a challenge? WOW!). Anyhow, back from the digression,<br/>\n&gt; neither of us has READ Shakespeare since the mandatory high school<br/>\n&gt; stuff. But, we know enough bits of it to catch the references where<br/>\n&gt; they pop up (odd places like Spongebob and the Simpsons and so on)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And speaking of Shakespeare, Dr. Who had an excellent episode where the<br/>\n&gt; Dr. and Martha Jones went back in time and met Shakespeare and watched<br/>\n&gt; a play at the Globe Theater and all. Very cool. All about the power of<br/>\n&gt; words. At the very end there was an homage to JK Rowling -<br/>\n&gt; Expelliarmus! (and the Dr. even said Way to go JK!

However, my dh was deprived because his parents heavily control the<br/>\nTV, the amount viewed and the content. The deference was our person<br/>\nperspectives on TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor years I never questioned the common conception that TV is &quot;bad&quot; and will<br/>\nmake you stupid. I just didn&#39;t have one. I didn&#39;t supply one for my dd. She<br/>\nloved TV and I kept it from her. I did it because I thought it was the right<br/>\nthing to do.

But then again, almost no tv is.  In our home, <br/>\nwe preview shows before we show them to our children and typically <br/>\nonly let them watch things like The Brady Bunch and Little House on <br/>\nthe Prairie.  My kids used to come home from school saying that they <br/>\nare culturally deprived because all the other children at school <br/>\nwatched lots of tv and then spent most school time discussing it.  So <br/>\nwe pulled them from that school and now they spend their time reading <br/>\nand going to Shakespeare plays instead.  Who is really culturally <br/>\ndeprived here? <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYour kids are really culturally deprived.<br/>\nI watched The Brady Bunch and Little House on the Prarie and Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley and Gilligan&#39;s Island and Bewitched and All in the Family and lots and lots of other shows. Those were the shows of my time and a bit earlier. Gilligan&#39;s Island and The Brady Bunch and Bewitched were all on after school on some rotation where each was available for some period of time and then the next.  I watched other shows, too. My parents were quite keen to not limit my media experience. They used to take me to R rated movies when I was young to broaden my horizons. I saw Everything You Wanted to Know about Sex but Were Afraid to Ask when I was too little to remember what it completely and would ocassionally ask what the movie was with a giant boob rolling around. Nobody could tell me.  Although they were loathe to get cable when it came out and I had to fill that desire with the cable at the homes where I babysat. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I wasn&#39;t culturally deprived because I lived fully within my culture. Part of the culture of my childhood was television. It was knowing all about Luke and Laura on General Hospital and Chachi and Joanie and The Greatest American Hero and going from listening to Bill Cosby comedy albums and 500 children on gocarts going down the hill to  Eddie Murphy and ice creams and Steve Martin singing about King Tut. And because of all of those things I was able to talk with my friends about ideas and approaches to humor and to have common references. I was also able to discover what I liked and to have a taste for my own culture. I could not like &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and like &quot;Rock n Roll High School&quot;. Because I was wealthy in cultural experiences I could pick and choose what I most enjoyed. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy limiting your children to culture that has a range from 500 to 25 years ago you are limiting their ability to communicate with other people and to judge for themselves variations between television shows.  And other countries. That&#39;s so cool. I love watching the way that tension is built up and released in Japanese movies, it is done at a very different pace to U.S. or U.K. movies. That&#39;s true historically as well. Watching the old Parent Trap versus the remake. The concerns about being loved by both parents, the change in the culture of divorce.  Wonderful things to talk about. Remakes are fascinating things. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents-in-law have insulated themselves against the cultures in which they lived. They were very specific in their cultural approach. They lived in Oman and in Pakistan and in Hong Kong and the Phillipines to name a few places and in all of those places they worked hard not to let the regional culture touch them. They wanted to remain as British as they possibly could. They had staff who were required to maintain things as would be normal for a British household, breakfast at 8, coffee at 11, lunch at 1, tea at 4, dinner at 7 with the  required meat and two vegetables. David loved to hide out in the kitchen with his Amah and the cooks.  The food was so much better there, where the cook was cooking the food he or she knew, rather than the recipes that David&#39;s mom required, and David loved listening to the language flowing around him. When they lived in Sri Lanka and he came back for Christmas break he got the cook to serve him a different fruit every<br/>\n morning for breakfast. Something that his parents would never have done.  They wanted a wall between themselves and the world they lived in. A wall that let them hold on to their sense of being British. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a similar wall that you are erecting between your children and the culture at large. Have you expanded out from the shows you allow? Having children who aren&#39;t versed in the Brady Bunch, Simon and Linnaea don&#39;t really appreciate The Brady Bunch movies. I imagine your children would be able to enjoy the heck out of the humorous look back. And it might get you thinking about living a life that is out of sync with the world around you. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: looking for feedback","postDate":"1222784449","msgId":36282,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyNjA2Ny4zOTM1My5xbUB3ZWI1MzgxMC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36281,"nextInTopic":36283,"prevInTime":36281,"nextInTime":36283,"topicId":36254,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"She has retained all her sparkle and most of her authenticity. i say most only because she is trying on different hats right now and feeling out the teenage","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1847758393\">She has retained all her sparkle and most of her authenticity. i say most only because she is trying on different &quot;hats&quot; right now and feeling out the teenage social circles and exploring their games.

That&#39;s not a criticism,  <br/>\njust that parents tend to worry that there&#39;s something magnetic about  <br/>\nadult programs that kids will naturally drift to if they&#39;re given  <br/>\nfree rein. It just isn&#39;t true. They no more drift to adult programs  <br/>\nthan they do the adult section of the bookstore or library.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I later told my dtr that I didn&#39;t like the way the<br/>\n&gt; show made women seem like sex objects and that it gave the impression<br/>\n&gt; that you have to look a certain way in order for people to like you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My guess is that this was said with some tension because you were  <br/>\ntrying to undo any positive message about values you don&#39;t agree with  <br/>\nthat the program might have placed in her head.

I think what will help is if you pass on  <br/>\nyour comments as you might to a friend, rather than as a lessons you  <br/>\nwant to get into them to negate something they&#39;ve seen. It&#39;s more  <br/>\nhonest to say &quot;I&#39;m not really enjoying the humor in this. I think I&#39;d  <br/>\nlike to play a game. Anyone want to join me?&quot; Make it about you  <br/>\nrather than about them. Be okay if they&#39;d rather watch. Ask what  <br/>\nthey&#39;re finding funny.

Rather  <br/>\nthan seeing the world divided into what you want them to see and what  <br/>\nyou don&#39;t want them to see, divide the world into what interests them  <br/>\nand what doesn&#39;t (yet) interest them. They want to avoid the things  <br/>\nthat don&#39;t yet interest them! I&#39;m sure Ugly Betty isn&#39;t high on their  <br/>\nlist of what interest them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re often faced with not having something to watch, you might  <br/>\ntry Netflix. (I think there lowest rate is $5 a month.) Or a  DVR so  <br/>\nyou can record their favorite shows and time shift them to the times  <br/>\nyou&#39;re available to watch. (VCR tapes work too, of course! I had  <br/>\nloads of episodes taped from TV when Kat was young.) Or keeping a  <br/>\nselection from the library. Shop library sales and movie rental place  <br/>\nsales for movies and shows they would like to see.
