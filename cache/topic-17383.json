Little boys walk up<br/>\nto the MAC counter and want to touch or look....&quot;that&#39;s NOT for boys&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;That is for GIRLS&quot; in a mean voice. Makes me cringe terribly. I<br/>\ntry to tactfully say something to counter that ugly message, like<br/>\npointing out that we have a BOY (gasp) working behind the counter, so<br/>\nobviously it&#39;s NOT just for girls. ARgh to the tenth power. Or I say<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s really fun to play in colors, isn&#39;t it?&quot; and smile sweetly at<br/>\nthem. Hopefully they&#39;ll grow up to understand there is nothing wrong<br/>\nwith them, just their parents!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are so many messages about gender.

Isn&#39;t that like assuming that a woman who stays at  <br/>\nhome with the kids can&#39;t be a feminist? Maybe you&#39;re projecting onto  <br/>\nunschoolers the conservative values of southerners because the  <br/>\noutward appearance is similar?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are genetically preprogrammed to be social creatures. We *want* to  <br/>\nfit in with society. Unless a child has strong feelings of wanting  <br/>\nsomething other than convention, I think it&#39;s natural for people  <br/>\n(including kids) to get their clues of &quot;how things are done&quot; from  <br/>\nothers. Not clonish copies but sort  of tribal customs.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite how alike certain movements insist boys and girls are, there  <br/>\nare differences. Boys tend to be more logic oriented. Girls tend to  <br/>\nbe more language oriented. Boys tend to rough housing. Girls tend to  <br/>\nnot-as-rough housing ;-) Boys tend to build towers. Girls tend to  <br/>\nbuild caves. Boys tend towards fighting video games. Girls tend  <br/>\ntowards social video games. That doesn&#39;t say anything about how an  <br/>\nindividual boy or girl will be, but taken as a whole boys tend to be  <br/>\nmore boy-like and girls tend to be more girl-like ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is being written by someone who went into engineering and  <br/>\nwhose daughter liked dinosaurs and trucks rather than Barbies and had  <br/>\nnever chosen to wear a dress on her own before she was 14. The girls  <br/>\nin engineering *were* different than the girls in other majors.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s pure speculation but I think the desire to go against convention  <br/>\nor the lack of interest in convention is as genetic as the desire to  <br/>\nblend into the tribe. It&#39;s just not as common. (Not counting the  <br/>\npeople who choose to go against convention as a form of protest.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"not trying to be annoying","postDate":"1158680327","msgId":17397,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVlcDJ1Nyt1cnJkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17396,"nextInTopic":17398,"prevInTime":17396,"nextInTime":17398,"topicId":17383,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m sitting here thinking about the whole gender issue and how most parents aren t even aware enough to give their child a comfortable place for trying out","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-793273355\">I&#39;m sitting here thinking about the whole gender issue and how most<br/>\nparents aren&#39;t even aware enough to give their child a comfortable<br/>\nplace for trying out gender roles, but how that is NOT my experience<br/>\nwith the unschooling crowd.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conference for example, both Cameron Lovejoy and James Coburn wear<br/>\nskirts.

I don&#39;t think <br/>\n&quot;coercion&quot; and &quot;choice&quot; are necessarily opposites.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen dinner is ready, I call everyone to the table.

In some families, that might be appropriate.  But my way is  not <br/>\ncoercive, just because it isn&#39;t presented as a choice.<br/>\n <br/>\nNo, I do not think buying my children clothes without their consent is  <br/>\ncoercive.  I buy them toys and books and DVD&#39;s, some they like and some  they <br/>\ndon&#39;t.  It is no big deal.  No, I haven&#39;t bought my son a dress,  but I also never <br/>\nput out chopsticks when he started feeding himself.  We  naturally do what <br/>\nmakes sense in our home, our neighborhood, our town, our  culture.  If it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nfeel right to someone, then we can do something  else.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think what is more important is that the child *trusts* (built from  <br/>\nexperience) that his desires will be honored by the family.

The girls seem to have the most range of wearing<br/>\n-alternative-fashions, some different hair color,  Almost exactly like<br/>\na normal cut of the population.<br/>\nHow is this NOT coersive parenting? I know this is not the<br/>\nAlwaysUnschooled yahoo list and maybe it would fit there better<br/>\nbut...isn&#39;t dictating when they are very young &#39;proper gender roles&#39;<br/>\ncompletely coersive? I know ppl could say, that is what he/she likes<br/>\nto wear but isn&#39;t that also what the parent is comfortable with?<br/>\nDid you ask him before that *first hair cut* if that is what he<br/>\nwanted? Did you ever put him in a dress? And if not, why not?<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that letting him be led by what he sees on tv? What he feels<br/>\nfrom the parents is the right answer? Do they get to pick out/purchase<br/>\ntheir own clothes?<br/>\nI will share my own experience. I have two older girls, my 7yr old<br/>\ndresses like a &#39;typical boy&#39; most days. she has just started wearing<br/>\nher hair longer but she has always liked it really short. She wears<br/>\ncargo shorts, skateboarding tshirts, and converse allstars. Sometimes<br/>\nshe will wear dresses for days but it is unusual. For years until she<br/>\nwas maybe 5 she didn&#39;t wear clothes. I didn&#39;t make her. Now she likes<br/>\nto play princess sometimes but most days it is still pirate. Almost<br/>\nall of her friends are boys, she climbs trees, skateboards, jumps off<br/>\nof higher and higher things.<br/>\nNow a lot of ppl think that is okay, &#39;she is just a little girl, she<br/>\nis so cute in those boy clothes&#39;. But what about this...<br/>\nI also have 2 younger boys. My 3rd child will be 5 in November, we<br/>\ntook him and the girls to get haircuts when he was about 1. He saw his<br/>\nsisters get their hair cut and when it was his turn we put him in the<br/>\nchair and he holds onto the back of his neck and starts shaking his<br/>\nhead. I asked him &quot;what?&quot; and he said &quot;no, my hair&quot; in this really sad<br/>\nvoice, so the lady said she could just do it anyway. I said no, it is<br/>\nhis hair and we left. Grandparents tried bribing him, uncles tried<br/>\nforcing him, everyone else(except us) tried by making him feel bad<br/>\nabout himself. My husband and I just decided that it was his hair he<br/>\nwould cut it when he felt like it. Well...he is 4.5 and his hair is<br/>\ndown to his WAIST. The prettiest hair you have ever seen. But we live<br/>\nin the south and young boys Do Not have long hair. He has been called<br/>\na sissy by adults! We have been told in complete seriousness &quot;you need<br/>\nto cut his hair now...or he will start acting like a girl&quot; To be<br/>\nhonest, I like his hair and I am proud of him,  proud of him for not<br/>\ncaving when even his little guy friends tell him to cut his hair.<br/>\nSo even though I may be coersive in other aspects of my<br/>\nparenting(working on that) Can we open this discussion? He wears<br/>\ndresses too! But it is funny, he has started not wanting to wear<br/>\ndresses or pink (it was his favorite color for years) because he says<br/>\nit is too girly, but his hair is soooo long. Personally I think it is<br/>\ngreat but man I get a lot of flak. And when ppl say &quot;what a pretty<br/>\nlittle girl&quot; he says &quot;no, sir&quot; if it is a woman and &quot;no, maam&quot; if it<br/>\nis a man,(we do not make them talk like that to adults and he came up<br/>\nwith this on his own) my mother in law thinks it is really rude for<br/>\nhim to say that but I feel that if I correct the person and say &quot;no it<br/>\nis a little boy&quot; and they still say what a pretty girl then they have<br/>\nit coming.<br/>\nOkay so the question might have gotten lost in all my blah, blah,<br/>\nblah.. I think if ppl were really honest with me about this then the<br/>\nfood issues and the tv issues would be easier for me to deal with. But<br/>\nthose are for different posts.

He wears<br/>\n  dresses too! But it is funny, he has started not wanting to wear<br/>\n  dresses or pink (it was his favorite color for years) because he says<br/>\n  it is too girly, but his hair is soooo long.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe you assumed some of the long haired children on the blogs are<br/>\n  girls...did you think of that?:) You really don&#39;t know gender from a<br/>\n  picture at a blog, I think your assumption from a picture is playing<br/>\n  right into the whole gender role stereotype.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can&#39;t tell gender from a picture. I can&#39;t tell a girl from a boy in<br/>\n  real life many times (esp. at the conference unless they&#39;re more in<br/>\n  line with typical boy/girl looks).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jalen had very long hair until recently, when he took a buzzer to his<br/>\n  own head. His long hair lasted until he was 5 years old and he chose<br/>\n  to cut it himself. Not much coercion there. Yeah, we dressed him in<br/>\n  typical boy clothes but he&#39;s had girl clothes available and dressed in<br/>\n  them quite often. In fact, he loves dressing in typical girl clothing<br/>\n  daily now, but doesn&#39;t want anyone to see him. We figure the reason he<br/>\n  wants to hide is all the messages he&#39;s gotten from mainstream<br/>\n  society/tv about what boys &quot;should&quot; wear. Those messages exist. I<br/>\n  think he&#39;ll find a way to navigate his own desires against those messages.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Every society on the earth has gender roles. It&#39;s part of living in a<br/>\n  society. So I&#39;m not sure why there is anything coercive about dressing<br/>\n  kids in what is &quot;traditional&quot; garb for our society. You could say<br/>\n  we&#39;re &quot;coercive&quot; for not dressing them in other time periods instead<br/>\n  of modern clothes. People aren&#39;t going to have every option in the<br/>\n  entire world within their home. But as children explore the world with<br/>\n  you, it&#39;s important to support their interests and<br/>\n  fascinations...which include trying on gender roles and various clothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jalen also loves wearing nail polish and putting makeup on us. All of<br/>\n  that has been fully supported just as it would be with anyone in the<br/>\n  house...gender has nothing to do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s coercive to not give your kid every clothing<br/>\n  option under the sun from birth. Not possible. Having various gender<br/>\n  styles available is great....we can do that! I don&#39;t have 17th and<br/>\n  18th century costumes avaiable to them, I DO have 15th<br/>\n  century....coercive? If they became fascinated with a time period and<br/>\n  wanted costumes, we&#39;d figure out a way. Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean you<br/>\n  can provide the whole world within your home, it does mean supporting<br/>\n  them in whatever fascination they have.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sierra has mostly worn only jeans or shorts for many years now. Just<br/>\n  recently she&#39;s interested in skirts and dresses again (she&#39;s 9). I<br/>\n  dressed her in cute little dresses and girly stuff as a baby, I really<br/>\n  don&#39;t think she cared! When she let her preference be known, we<br/>\n  honored that. She&#39;s gone through phases of wanting short or long hair<br/>\n  and is currently undecided about shaving her hair off. I have a 13<br/>\n  y.o. boy with fairly long hair and a 16.5 y.o. with a mohawk (see<br/>\n  conference pics). If a child chooses current gender clothing, that<br/>\n  isn&#39;t limiting them. In a home where trust is plentiful, they have no<br/>\n  fear about trying out other gender roles if that fascinates them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m pretty sure my 5y.o. will fully explore cross-dressing when he&#39;s a<br/>\n  bit older and more comfortable ignoring societal messages......maybe<br/>\n  not. Either way, we haven&#39;t &quot;coerced&quot; anything by dressing him in<br/>\n  current fashions.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n  learninginfreedom.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":267954153,"authorName":"Brian & Alexandra Polikowsky","from":"&quot;Brian & Alexandra Polikowsky&quot; &lt;polykow@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] not trying to be annoying","postDate":"1158679148","msgId":17393,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMjMwMWM2ZGJmZSRmM2U4NmUzMCQ2NDU4YThjMEBPZmZpY2U+","referencesHeader":"PGVlb3Jhcis3OWxuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17392,"nextInTopic":17394,"prevInTime":17392,"nextInTime":17394,"topicId":17383,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 4 year old son likes his hair like dadyy s and love boy s stuff.

I don&#39;t have any daughters, so I really can&#39;t address that one, but I can talk about my boys and their styles.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have three boys -- 21, 10 & 5.  They&#39;ve always chosen their own styles of hair and dress, in or out of school.  My oldest was sporting razor lines, spikes and long curly rattail at 4yo -- he&#39;s always had his own ideas of how he wants to look.  It&#39;s been skater cuts, military shaves, long wild curly hair, and at the moment, shaved.  He shaves it because his hair is so curly it frizzes at any length shorter than shoulder length and he hates to brush it.  For a time, it neared dreadlocks, but now he works as a cook at a barbeque place and shaved is just easier for him to maintain.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My 10 yo has let his hair grow long a few times, but as it gets curlier (the curse of all boys in my family line) with age, he prefers it a bit shorter. He&#39;s been upset to have people mistake him for a girl.  Now, tho, after the conference last week, where most of his friends are boys with long hair, I think he&#39;s reconsidering that.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  The 5yo had his hair longer than shoulder length at last winter, asked for it short in the spring and had his most recent haircut in July.  He tends to decide spur-of-the moment and we cut it accordingly.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  They all choose their own clothes, and each has his own style.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Did you ask him before that *first hair cut* if that is what he<br/>\nwanted? Did you ever put him in a dress? And if not, why not?<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that letting him be led by what he sees on tv? What he feels<br/>\nfrom the parents is the right answer? Do they get to pick out/purchase<br/>\ntheir own clothes?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Yep, we do ask with each haircut.  My boys have never asked to wear a dress, but if they wanted to, they certainly could.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  For years until she was maybe 5 she didn&#39;t wear clothes. I didn&#39;t make her. Now she likes to play princess sometimes but most days it is still pirate.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sounds like the little girls in our unschooling tribe -- naked or pirates.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Okay so the question might have gotten lost in all my blah, blah,<br/>\nblah..

When he was eight with long <br/>\nhair and at camp, someone called him a girl. He came home and <br/>\nimmediately asked for a hair cut. Short and very handsome---but he <br/>\ntired of it after a while and let it grow again. It would be past his <br/>\nbutt now if he hadn&#39;t have cut it way back then.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Duncan (10) is regularly called a girl---even in &quot;alternative&quot; places <br/>\nlike Albuquerque last week. But he just smiles and says. &quot;I&#39;m a boy, <br/>\nbut I get that *all* the time.&quot; &lt;g&gt; Folks generally kindly apologize.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I would have a problem if either boy were to be rude to someone for <br/>\nmaking a mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n Conference Coordinator<br/>\n Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;It&#39;s a small world...but a BIG life!&quot; ~Aaron McGlohn. aged 6<br/>\n<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\n From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ikylilgrl@...\">ikylilgrl@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n I am one of those ppl who learns by asking a lot of questions.

She wears<br/>\n cargo shorts, skateboarding tshirts, and converse allstars. Sometimes<br/>\n she will wear dresses for days but it is unusual. For years until she<br/>\n was maybe 5 she didn&#39;t wear clothes. I didn&#39;t make her. Now she likes<br/>\n to play princess sometimes but most days it is still pirate. Almost<br/>\n all of her friends are boys, she climbs trees, skateboards, jumps off<br/>\n of higher and higher things.<br/>\n Now a lot of ppl think that is okay, &#39;she is just a little girl, she<br/>\n is so cute in those boy clothes&#39;.

I asked him &quot;what?&quot; and he said &quot;no, my hair&quot; in this really sad<br/>\n voice, so the lady said she could just do it anyway. I said no, it is<br/>\n his hair and we left. Grandparents tried bribing him, uncles tried<br/>\n forcing him, everyone else(except us) tried by making him feel bad<br/>\n about himself. My husband and I just decided that it was his hair he<br/>\n would cut it when he felt like it. Well...he is 4.5 and his hair is<br/>\n down to his WAIST. The prettiest hair you have ever seen.

I have 3 boys, all with long hair.  None of<br/>\nthem had haircuts until they were around 3 and started cutting their own<br/>\nhair (all of them did this shortly before their 3rd birthdays).  We&#39;ve been<br/>\nin the same situation where the boy first wants a haircut at a shop then<br/>\nchanges his mind so they get down out of the chair, usually with strange<br/>\nlooks from the haircutter person, who is accustomed to parents making their<br/>\nkids get their haircut against their will.  We offer to trim their hair out<br/>\nof their eyes when it&#39;s bothering them (as evidenced by constantly pushing<br/>\nthe hair aside, sighs, puffing consternation, and eye infections), and honor<br/>\ntheir response to the offer.  We honor their requests to go get their hair<br/>\ncut professionally when they ask (hardly ever, these days).  I talked to<br/>\nthem at the beginning of the year about growing out their hair for charity<br/>\nand they all thought that was a neat concept, so we&#39;re doing that, but if<br/>\nthey change their mind, we&#39;ll honor that, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re all regularly called &quot;her&quot; and &quot;she&quot; but we don&#39;t correct people<br/>\nbecause we don&#39;t really care about other people&#39;s misperceptions.  They<br/>\neither don&#39;t hear the remark or don&#39;t care, because I&#39;ve never heard any of<br/>\nthem correct anyone about it, even though none of them are shy about<br/>\ncorrecting adults in other ways.  When adults have tried to be coercive,<br/>\nshaming, or manipulative with them, I&#39;ve stepped between them and the adult<br/>\nto stop the assault and remove the boy from the situation.  I&#39;ve changed the<br/>\nsubject with my MIL when she speaks to them rudely about their hair or<br/>\nclothes (and other things).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as clothes, my mother sends them all sorts of costumes, hair things<br/>\n(barettes, headbands, etc), and clothes with no eye to gender and they all<br/>\nenjoy everything she sends.  I only shop online and they sit with me when<br/>\nI&#39;m shopping, picking out what they want.  I don&#39;t knowingly interfere with<br/>\nthe process, but I&#39;m sure I have all sorts of influence over what they<br/>\nchoose, if only by the choices I make in my own wardrobe.  Likewise with<br/>\ntheir dad.  I think I point them in the direction of comfortable cottons,<br/>\nespecially my middle boy, who can&#39;t abide tags or clothes that don&#39;t &quot;feel<br/>\nright&quot;.  So yes, I do have an influence, though I try to be conscious of it<br/>\nand stick to practical concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s us :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJenniffer in Harpers Ferry<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://octopigarden.blogspot.com\">http://octopigarden.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9/19/06, Su &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ikylilgrl@...\">ikylilgrl@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I am one of those ppl who learns by asking a lot of questions.

There are times when my son looks like the<br/>\naverage American boy with short hair, a Power Rangers t-shirt and a<br/>\npair of denim shorts.  6 months later (in the dead of winter) you<br/>\nmight find him with shoulder length hair in the same t-shirt and<br/>\nshorts (or perhaps he actually decided to wear sweatpants that day!)<br/>\nMy girls have also had short hair and long hair.  They&#39;ve been<br/>\neverything from their natural dark blonde to red to jet goth black.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t dictate how they wear their hair.  That is their doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that children are influenced some by society, though.  Boys<br/>\nsee other boys (or male role models - personal or celebrity) with<br/>\nshort hair and decide to cut their hair.  Girls see other girls (and<br/>\nfemale role models - personal or celebrity) with the latest hairdo and<br/>\ndecide to grow their hair out (or chop it off).  My son had waist<br/>\nlength blonde curls until he was 3yo when he decided he wanted short<br/>\nhair.  His idea.  We&#39;d never asked him and never thought of it.  His<br/>\nfather also has waist lenght hair (while his mother has changed her<br/>\nhair many times)  Since then he has grown it out several times.  He<br/>\ncurrently is in a &quot;growing out stage&quot; after having it buzz cut for the<br/>\nsummer because he said his head was too hot.  He has extremely THICK<br/>\nhair and usually does this every summer - asking on his own.  I<br/>\nactually think if he were a girl he would probably do the same thing.<br/>\nAnd I would help him/her achieve that goal.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen Ren&#39;s beautiful children go from their natural blonde colors<br/>\nto every color under the sun and with styles from traditional to &quot;a<br/>\nbit out there!&quot;  (There were pics last week from the L&L conference<br/>\nwith Trevor with long spikey hair which made me have major flash backs<br/>\nto college! LOL!)  I don&#39;t believe she has coerced her children into<br/>\ncoloring their hair with bubblegum pink stripes!

I have two older girls, my 7yr old<br/>\n dresses like a &#39;typical boy&#39; most days. she has just started wearing<br/>\n her hair longer but she has always liked it really short. She wears<br/>\n cargo shorts, skateboarding tshirts, and converse allstars. Sometimes<br/>\n she will wear dresses for days but it is unusual. For years until she<br/>\n was maybe 5 she didn&#39;t wear clothes. I didn&#39;t make her. Now she likes<br/>\n to play princess sometimes but most days it is still pirate. Almost<br/>\n all of her friends are boys, she climbs trees, skateboards, jumps off<br/>\n of higher and higher things. <br/>\n Now a lot of ppl think that is okay, &#39;she is just a little girl, she<br/>\n is so cute in those boy clothes&#39;. But what about this...<br/>\n I also have 2 younger boys. My 3rd child will be 5 in November, we<br/>\n took him and the girls to get haircuts when he was about 1. He saw his<br/>\n sisters get their hair cut and when it was his turn we put him in the<br/>\n chair and he holds onto the back of his neck and starts shaking his<br/>\n head. I asked him &quot;what?&quot; and he said &quot;no, my hair&quot; in this really sad<br/>\n voice, so the lady said she could just do it anyway. I said no, it is<br/>\n his hair and we left. Grandparents tried bribing him, uncles tried<br/>\n forcing him, everyone else(except us) tried by making him feel bad<br/>\n about himself. My husband and I just decided that it was his hair he<br/>\n would cut it when he felt like it. Well...he is 4.5 and his hair is<br/>\n down to his WAIST. The prettiest hair you have ever seen. But we live<br/>\n in the south and young boys Do Not have long hair. He has been called<br/>\n a sissy by adults! We have been told in complete seriousness &quot;you need<br/>\n to cut his hair now...or he will start acting like a girl&quot; To be<br/>\n honest, I like his hair and I am proud of him,  proud of him for not<br/>\n caving when even his little guy friends tell him to cut his hair. <br/>\n So even though I may be coersive in other aspects of my<br/>\n parenting(working on that) Can we open this discussion? He wears<br/>\n dresses too! But it is funny, he has started not wanting to wear<br/>\n dresses or pink (it was his favorite color for years) because he says<br/>\n it is too girly, but his hair is soooo long. Personally I think it is<br/>\n great but man I get a lot of flak. And when ppl say &quot;what a pretty<br/>\n little girl&quot; he says &quot;no, sir&quot; if it is a woman and &quot;no, maam&quot; if it<br/>\n is a man,(we do not make them talk like that to adults and he came up<br/>\n with this on his own) my mother in law thinks it is really rude for<br/>\n him to say that but I feel that if I correct the person and say &quot;no it<br/>\n is a little boy&quot; and they still say what a pretty girl then they have<br/>\n it coming. <br/>\n Okay so the question might have gotten lost in all my blah, blah,<br/>\n blah.. I think if ppl were really honest with me about this then the<br/>\n food issues and the tv issues would be easier for me to deal with. But<br/>\n those are for different posts. I will let you guys breathe a bit.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n     <br/>\n                       <br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nTalk is cheap. Use Yahoo!

But it is funny, he has started not wanting to wear<br/>\ndresses or pink (it was his favorite color for years) because he says<br/>\nit is too girly, but his hair is soooo long.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you assumed some of the long haired children on the blogs are<br/>\ngirls...did you think of that?:) You really don&#39;t know gender from a<br/>\npicture at a blog, I think your assumption from a picture is playing<br/>\nright into the whole gender role stereotype.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell gender from a picture. I can&#39;t tell a girl from a boy in<br/>\nreal life many times (esp. at the conference unless they&#39;re more in<br/>\nline with typical boy/girl looks).<br/>\n<br/>\nJalen had very long hair until recently, when he took a buzzer to his<br/>\nown head. His long hair lasted until he was 5 years old and he chose<br/>\nto cut it himself. Not much coercion there. Yeah, we dressed him in<br/>\ntypical boy clothes but he&#39;s had girl clothes available and dressed in<br/>\nthem quite often. In fact, he loves dressing in typical girl clothing<br/>\ndaily now, but doesn&#39;t want anyone to see him. We figure the reason he<br/>\nwants to hide is all the messages he&#39;s gotten from mainstream<br/>\nsociety/tv about what boys &quot;should&quot; wear. Those messages exist. I<br/>\nthink he&#39;ll find a way to navigate his own desires against those messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery society on the earth has gender roles. It&#39;s part of living in a<br/>\nsociety. So I&#39;m not sure why there is anything coercive about dressing<br/>\nkids in what is &quot;traditional&quot; garb for our society. You could say<br/>\nwe&#39;re &quot;coercive&quot; for not dressing them in other time periods instead<br/>\nof modern clothes. People aren&#39;t going to have every option in the<br/>\nentire world within their home. But as children explore the world with<br/>\nyou, it&#39;s important to support their interests and<br/>\nfascinations...which include trying on gender roles and various clothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nJalen also loves wearing nail polish and putting makeup on us. All of<br/>\nthat has been fully supported just as it would be with anyone in the<br/>\nhouse...gender has nothing to do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s coercive to not give your kid every clothing<br/>\noption under the sun from birth. Not possible. Having various gender<br/>\nstyles available is great....we can do that! I don&#39;t have 17th and<br/>\n18th century costumes avaiable to them, I DO have 15th<br/>\ncentury....coercive? If they became fascinated with a time period and<br/>\nwanted costumes, we&#39;d figure out a way. Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean you<br/>\ncan provide the whole world within your home, it does mean supporting<br/>\nthem in whatever fascination they have.<br/>\n<br/>\nSierra has mostly worn only jeans or shorts for many years now. Just<br/>\nrecently she&#39;s interested in skirts and dresses again (she&#39;s 9). I<br/>\ndressed her in cute little dresses and girly stuff as a baby, I really<br/>\ndon&#39;t think she cared!  When she let her preference be known, we<br/>\nhonored that. She&#39;s gone through phases of wanting short or long hair<br/>\nand is currently undecided about shaving her hair off. I have a 13<br/>\ny.o. boy with fairly long hair and a 16.5 y.o. with a mohawk (see<br/>\nconference pics). If a child chooses current gender clothing, that<br/>\nisn&#39;t limiting them. In a home where trust is plentiful, they have no<br/>\nfear about trying out other gender roles if that fascinates them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure my 5y.o. will fully explore cross-dressing when he&#39;s a<br/>\nbit older and more comfortable ignoring societal messages......maybe<br/>\nnot.  Either way, we haven&#39;t &quot;coerced&quot; anything by dressing him in<br/>\ncurrent fashions.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":178533147,"authorName":"Su","from":"&quot;Su&quot; &lt;ikylilgrl@...&gt;","profile":"veganmamma3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"not trying to be annoying","postDate":"1158672539","msgId":17383,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVlb3Jhcis3OWxuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":17384,"prevInTime":17382,"nextInTime":17384,"topicId":17383,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am one of those ppl who learns by asking a lot of questions.

I don&#39;t know all of you, only a couple in person. I have been<br/>\nlooking at a lot of websites and a lot of blogs. One thing that I have<br/>\ncome across is that most all the little boys have short hair and dress<br/>\nin &#39;typical american boy&#39; outfits. Shirts with moving vehicles,<br/>\ndinosaurs, tv or movie characters, and camoflage. And the girls mostly<br/>\nhave longer hair in pretty styles, and wear pastels, flowers, brats<br/>\nand barbie. The girls seem to have the most range of wearing<br/>\n-alternative-fashions, some different hair color,  Almost exactly like<br/>\na normal cut of the population. <br/>\nHow is this NOT coersive parenting? I know this is not the<br/>\nAlwaysUnschooled yahoo list and maybe it would fit there better<br/>\nbut...isn&#39;t dictating when they are very young &#39;proper gender roles&#39;<br/>\ncompletely coersive? I know ppl could say, that is what he/she likes<br/>\nto wear but isn&#39;t that also what the parent is comfortable with? <br/>\nDid you ask him before that *first hair cut* if that is what he<br/>\nwanted? Did you ever put him in a dress? And if not, why not?<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that letting him be led by what he sees on tv? What he feels<br/>\nfrom the parents is the right answer?
