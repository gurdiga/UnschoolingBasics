How do we,<br/>\nas a family, weave together everyone&#39;s desires when it comes to<br/>\nsleeping, beds, and sex (okay, so the sex has to do with me and my Hot<br/>\nHubby, not the kids)?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what we&#39;ve got:<br/>\n<br/>\nI love it when my kids sleep in my bed with me.  <br/>\nMy husband doesn&#39;t like it.  <br/>\nOur kids LOVE to sleep in our bed with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a king size bed.<br/>\nThe kids each have full size beds (one is a loft bed my husband built<br/>\nfor my daughter)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband sometimes falls asleep on the couch (although, now that I<br/>\nam NOT harshly judging the TV and computer, he is more likely to<br/>\nfollow me up to bed when I go up around 9 or 10 pm.  THANK YOU<br/>\nun-schoolers for leading me to accepting and rejoicing in the<br/>\npleasures of TV and computers!!!  My family is much more happy now!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am tired at night and usually want to fall asleep around 9 pm.<br/>\nI love getting up early!<br/>\nI have rheumatoid arthritis, and sometimes sleeping with kids snuggled<br/>\nup against my body makes me ache more.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and son love to sleep in late and go to bed late.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son and daughter typically come up to bed when I go up and they<br/>\nlove to snuggle with me in my bed and fall asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is easily transferred to her bed when HH comes up (at<br/>\nleast, she will go there and not come back later).  Although, if she<br/>\nknows that we are going to ask her to move to her bed during the<br/>\nnight, she will usually want to fall asleep in her bed.  Getting up<br/>\ninto a loft while she is half asleep doesn&#39;t feel safe to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son can be carried to his bed, but when he wakes up he comes in and<br/>\nasks to get into our bed, at which point, my husband yells &quot;NO!&quot; and<br/>\nthen there is a back and forth all night long, or my son turns on his<br/>\nI-pod stories in his bedroom so that we all can hear, or loudly calls<br/>\nthe dog to his bed.  This can go on throughout the night and into the<br/>\nmorning until my sweet son sneaks his way into our bed again (usually<br/>\nafter I am up and about for the morning).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter gets jealous if her brother is sleeping in my bed and she<br/>\nis not.  Same is true the other way around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am in the middle of the bed, which is where everyone wants me so<br/>\nthat they can be next to me, my body aches!!  I need room to move<br/>\naround and get comfortable.  Rheumatoid arthritis is often worse at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, where in all of this do Hot Hubby and I fit sex??<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thought I had, was to let the kids know that we will be going to<br/>\nthe bedroom for a while after dinner a couple of nights each week, and<br/>\nthey can enjoy TV or reading or what ever, on their own.  And, that<br/>\nthis would let mom and dad get some time to connect, which would make<br/>\nsleeping arrangements more flexible.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI like this idea because it makes our couple time intentional, rather<br/>\nthan a catch as catch can.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWithin flexible sleeping arrangements, we would all need to be<br/>\nsensitive to the fact that I need SPACE in which to feel comfortable<br/>\nwhile I sleep.  So, maybe some brainstorming around how to help mommy<br/>\nfeel comfortable at night, could also help.  (of course, HH&#39;s answer<br/>\nto that is make the kids sleep in their own beds, where they belong!!<br/>\n So, perhaps some more advice on husbands would help here.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think of my idea??<br/>\nDoes anyone have any other ideas or experience??<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nElli<br/>\nMom to Peter, 8 years and Sophia, 10 years</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38561,"nextTopicId":38630}}
