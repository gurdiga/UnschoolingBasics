My DH is totally supportive, but does<br/>\n&gt; have one <br/>\n&gt; concern.  Our children, ages 8 and 9, enjoy staying<br/>\n&gt; up really late, <br/>\n&gt; then sleeping late in the mornings.  Originally, my<br/>\n&gt; DH&#39;s concern was <br/>\n&gt; because the kids usually make too much noise for him<br/>\n&gt; to sleep and <br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s the only one of us who is on a strict schedule.<br/>\n&gt;  He goes to bed <br/>\n&gt; around 11:00pm and wakes up at 6:30am to get ready<br/>\n&gt; for work.  So we <br/>\n&gt; talked to the kids, who totally understood the need<br/>\n&gt; for Dad to have <br/>\n&gt; quiet when he&#39;s sleeping, and everything has been<br/>\n&gt; fine.  We&#39;ve only <br/>\n&gt; had one incident where the kids set off our house<br/>\n&gt; alarm on accident, <br/>\n&gt; and it scared them to pieces!!  So now we don&#39;t set<br/>\n&gt; the alarm until <br/>\n&gt; I hear the kids going to bed.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, my DH is worried about the habits they<br/>\n&gt; might be forming.  <br/>\n&gt; They are staying up until 1:00am, sometimes 2:00am,<br/>\n&gt; every night.  <br/>\n&gt; They don&#39;t wake until 10:30 or 11:00am in the<br/>\n&gt; mornings.  My DH is <br/>\n&gt; worried that these hours will affect their health if<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t get <br/>\n&gt; enough rest.  I believe they are getting enough rest<br/>\n&gt; though because <br/>\n&gt; they are sleeping until they wake up on their own.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They&#39;ve had a scheduled bedtime for years.  Although<br/>\n&gt; we enforced <br/>\n&gt; the &#39;in your room at a certain time&#39; part of<br/>\n&gt; bedtime, we had no <br/>\n&gt; problems with them being awake reading for hours<br/>\n&gt; which is often what <br/>\n&gt; happened.  That&#39;s what helped me convince DH that<br/>\n&gt; their bedtime was <br/>\n&gt; so silly.  They never went to sleep before midnight<br/>\n&gt; anyway, so why <br/>\n&gt; force them to be in their rooms?  It felt wrong. <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m thinking that <br/>\n&gt; they feel a need to catch up on the things they<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t do before <br/>\n&gt; because they were in bed.  Of course, I know there<br/>\n&gt; are people who <br/>\n&gt; have natural rhythms that keep them active in the<br/>\n&gt; evenings and <br/>\n&gt; sleeping all morning.

It looks like the kids are getting<br/>\nbetter/more sleep than dad.  :)  When my girls were allowed to have control<br/>\nover their sleep patterns they were staying up until 1, 2, sometimes 3 am<br/>\nand getting up at 10, 11, noon.  After a while they started listening to<br/>\ntheir bodies after they realized that no one was going to make them go to<br/>\nbed.  Now Mary Elayne goes to bed each night around 11-11:30 on her own and<br/>\nEmily stays up until 1 or 2 (sometimes still 3) but that is when she does<br/>\nthe majority of her writing - the house is quiet, no disturbances, she can<br/>\nthink.  If they know we have something going on the next day they will<br/>\ndecide if they want to go to bed earlier or just deal with being tired the<br/>\nnext day.  It all works out in the end.  They enjoy going to resource day or<br/>\nour little Funschool that just finished for the year and chose to get up for<br/>\nit whether they had 9 or 5 hours of sleep.  There were a few times when<br/>\nEmily opted to not go and several times the kids would go and come home and<br/>\ncatch a nap.<br/>\n<br/>\nRest is what is important, not necessarily sleep.  Sleep has its purposes,<br/>\nbut many people find that just sitting and relaxing a for a while is as<br/>\ninvigorating as a full sleep cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244909672,"authorName":"freepsgal","from":"&quot;freepsgal&quot; &lt;freepsgal@...&gt;","profile":"freepsgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Sleeping habits","postDate":"1146493584","msgId":12693,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUzNTVxZys2c2twQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12699,"prevInTime":12692,"nextInTime":12694,"topicId":12693,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We transitioned into the radical unschooling lifestyle a couple of months ago.
