He looked<br/>\nforward to it as play time.  he went because at 2 1/2 his word was<br/>\n&quot;ball&quot; - no sentances, a few other words used basically as commands,<br/>\nand not much else.  That was when he was evaluated.  3 months later,<br/>\nwhen the specialist came for his first session, he was speaking simple<br/>\nsentences, following directions and interacting with people verbally -<br/>\ngranted it was still mostly ball related, but it had branched out some<br/>\n(I still don&#39;t know where he picked up such a passion for sports -<br/>\nneither Amy nor I care for sports in general and we rarely even watch<br/>\nanything).  She worked on developing sentance structure, did some sign<br/>\nlanguage (he&#39;s not deaf, but apparently it helps develop verbal<br/>\nskills), and played some skill building games which he loved.  when he<br/>\nwas re-evaluated after 6 months, he tested at high average verbally<br/>\nand no longer qualified for speech.  I don&#39;t know how much the therapy<br/>\nhad to do with that, but I know it was not wholly due to it because he<br/>\nhad developed so much between his initial evaluation and his first<br/>\nevaluation.  The therapist even said that this was not the child she<br/>\nexpected to be working with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think she did anything detrimental though, and as I said,<br/>\nZachary really enjoyed it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are teaching our daughter Zoe sign language on our own.

Anyway, we had a early<br/>\nintervention person come to our house every week for<br/>\nquite awhile.  She just played games with him to<br/>\nencourage him to use his words.  She finally admitted<br/>\nthat she wasn&#39;t doing anything I wasn&#39;t already doing<br/>\nmyself.
