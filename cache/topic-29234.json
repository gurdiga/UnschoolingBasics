They have loved coloring, playing with their toys, building a &#39;tent&#39; with the dining room table and blankets, playing hide and seek, playing ring around the rosie, watching dvds, dancing to music, playing in the tub (yes, sometimes in the middle of the day), taking naps, &#39;helping&#39; me in the kitchen, playing at the kitchen sink, nurtuting their &#39;babies&#39;, the list goes on and on.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  They are very happy, very healthy, very active, very bright, very talkative, very loving, in short, very content with things as they are.

These<br/>\nperiods seem to cycle, with less and less time in the panic mode as I trust<br/>\nmyself and my children more.  I used to forcefully strive to involve my<br/>\nolder son in outside activities, thinking that this was &quot;best&quot; for him,<br/>\nbecause of his social differences due to Autism.  Some of the activities we<br/>\nchose were lots of fun, some weren&#39;t.  Looking back on his earlier years<br/>\n(1-5) I believe I forced him into way too many contrived social<br/>\n&quot;opportunities&quot; for &quot;his own good&quot;.  Gah, that sounds so distasteful to me<br/>\nnow!  As Drew has gotten older (8.5 now) he has clearly been able to tell me<br/>\nwhat he wants to do and how often.  I&#39;ve finally woken up to the fact that<br/>\nhis social needs are *not* mine, or his brother&#39;s, or his father&#39;s (although<br/>\nthey are much closer to Dad&#39;s than anyone&#39;s).  My younger son and I love<br/>\npeople!  We like to be out and about, visiting and active.  Drew isn&#39;t that<br/>\nway, although he does enjoy people, it&#39;s on a much smaller scale.

Others are better with a sprinkling of going to<br/>\nthe park here adn there but nothing really scheduled. When DS was that<br/>\nage, we had a rule of thumb of no more than 3 outside the house &quot;events&quot;<br/>\nper week - Bible class was one, a park day might be two, a group trip of<br/>\nsome sort with our hs group would be 3 and that&#39;s it. Each week would<br/>\nvary - sometimes it was simply DS and DH going to a local park a couple<br/>\ntimes to run around. Too much going and doing would set DS up for<br/>\nmeltdowns as the week went on. Too little going and doing would create a<br/>\nsurplus of energy that he needed to vent. Balance was key.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen DS was around 3, we enrolled him in one of those activity/playtime<br/>\nthings for a winter season. We figured it&#39;d give him an outlet for<br/>\nenergy since winter in New England is not always the best place to get<br/>\noutdoors (particularly since we were in an apartment at the time, not a<br/>\nlot of indoor OR outdoor space to play). The first couple of times went<br/>\nwell. After that, the &quot;scheduled&quot; activities/themes started to get to be<br/>\na problem - the routine was play, sit quietly and listen to a story, do<br/>\norganized activities. Well, DS didn&#39;t WANT to sit quietly and listen<br/>\nwhile surrounded with all this COOL play stuff (and the stuff was indeed<br/>\ncool, lots of climbing stuff, mats to jump on/into, and so on). So, DH<br/>\n(he&#39;s the at home parent) would supervise DS while he played off to the<br/>\nside while the other kids sat quietly (but eyed DS all the while). After<br/>\na couple of those times, some of the other kids wanted to play as well<br/>\nwhich created a bit of tension. I don&#39;t think DS finished out that<br/>\n&#39;session&#39; and we never went back. We did however invest in a<br/>\nmini-trampoline that he could bounce in in the little bit of living room<br/>\nspace we had at the time. That was plenty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that to say It Depends. You are the expert on your kids. DO they<br/>\nneed something more right now? Are they acting like they need to get out<br/>\nmore? Are there resources you don&#39;t have available at home that might be<br/>\ninteresting to explore? There are no &quot;have to&quot;s at all - it all depends<br/>\non the whole mix of stuff that is unique to your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

I worked at a daycare where everything had to be very structured.  Now since I had been introduced to unschooling at the time , inside I was always feeling trapped myself.  Sooo if I felt trapped how did those kids feel...  I loved teaching the pre-school I tried to have lots of variety or centers for the kids to rotate around too ... However, it was what I choose for them to do not them.  Plus, we had to have rug time and the owner wanted me to do flash cards  -- ick now some kids liked them ---tried to find other weays to make fun.  however making 2 1/2 yr olds to 6 years old sit still is not easy and is really not natural.  the sometime we put in a high chair just to keep them still....  and they were threatened with not going out side.. (not my choice)   Plus, at nap time Patty was very fanatical about getting all of them down.. (not all kids want a nap -- again she would threaten to take something away) .  Reason I&#39;m<br/>\n telling you all this, is most daycares are very structured and not really child-led per se..   At the daycare I worked everyones intentions were good most of the time-- put as most places its about what the adults want!!!  Against my grain for sure -- the owner used to make comments all the time about me &quot;not getting them under control&quot; or that they were too loud ada, ada, ada.  Found myself yelling than too for them to settle down or quiet down -- then she would turn around and get after me?? Anyway now I&#39;m venting..  My point was that even though people need to utilize daycares and such --if you want your kids home with you than let it be so.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Oh another note.  Between 2 1/2 and 3 I signed my son up for a cool music class at the Flint instute of Music... Well, in short he didn&#39;t really like it... I felt that because he loved music and loved to dance around and sing in the microphone at home that he would really like this -- NOT ..  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Again,  if you and only you want to have your girls go to dance, gymnastics whatever,  most instructors would let you come in and observe to see if its a nice fit.  Just recently I did that with my boy (5 years old) with Tae kwon do.  He kept saying he liked to try it -- so I called the people up and the lady had me come in and she showed Ian a few of the pieces they use for learning and then let him pick out some piece he was interested in.... last night was his first night and he stepped right in!!  It&#39;s very play oriented - love it.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Ok there&#39;s enough of my two cents.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?
