Maybe.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyhow-I just typed and printed this (see below line) out to put on my<br/>\nlittle windowsill alter and thought that some people on this list may enjoy<br/>\nit.  I really really have a hard time with control (fear fear panic panic)<br/>\nand am actively working on this issue.  This resonated with me today, as it<br/>\nmay with a few of you.  I would LOVE to dialog about the issue of CONTROL<br/>\nand how it affects our parenting, unschooling and lives.  <br/>\n <br/>\nPLEASE KNOW I am not pushing any spiritual practice, just thought this was<br/>\nappropriate for unschoolers.  I know I am a new poster and on moderated<br/>\nstatus, so it is ok if this isn&#39;t appropriate or doesn&#39;t go through.<br/>\n <br/>\nMik in CT<br/>\nwith the wild boys, Beckett and Sawyer<br/>\n-----------------------------------------<br/>\n <br/>\nFrom:  Buddhism, Plain and Simple by Steve Hagen<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally our desire, our actions, our speech, and our thoughts are geared<br/>\ntoward bringing about some particular end by exerting control.  Then, when<br/>\nthese efforts at control fail (as they inevitably must if held onto too<br/>\nlong), we suffer.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Buddha-dharma doesn&#39;t ask us to give up control.   Instead, it<br/>\nacknowledges that we never had it in the first place.  When we can see this,<br/>\nthe desire to control naturally begins to wane.  The point is not to try to<br/>\nstop exerting control, or to condemn the desire to control as bad or wrong.<br/>\nThe point is to see things as they are, to acknowledge what&#39;s really gone<br/>\non.  Thought such acknowledgment and recognition, we can cease to suffer.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the center of our desire for control is our sense of self.  But with<br/>\nseeing, this sense loses its grip.  What becomes extinguished is this false<br/>\nsense of self.  We stop clinging to something that wasn&#39;t there to begin<br/>\nwith.  Our first reaction to this might be, &quot;But who would want that?&quot;  If<br/>\nwe look at this more carefully we&#39;ll find profound liberation in it.  For is<br/>\nwhat frightens us most is in fact illusionary, then waking up to its<br/>\nillusory nature yields the most profound freedom.  Our greatest fear is that<br/>\neach of us.&quot;I&quot;  will someday pass out of existence.  But how can something<br/>\ncease to exist that had no solid existence in the first place?  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Buddha said, <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJust as a man shudders with horror when he steps upon a serpent, but laughs<br/>\nwhen he looks down and sees that is is not a rope, so I discovered one day<br/>\nthat what I was calling &quot;I&quot; cannot be found, and all fear and anxiety<br/>\nvanished with my mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Buddha-dharma points the way for each of us to wake from this same basic<br/>\nmistake.  And when we awaken, our fears and anxieties quite naturally<br/>\nvanish, as the night fades away at the rising of the sun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":230706843,"authorName":"Betsy Hill","from":"&quot;Betsy Hill&quot; &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Unschooling Unschooling was Re: Unschooling as a &quot;club&quot;","postDate":"1152460799","msgId":15488,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU4cjk1ditpdnRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEY1NUFDQkQyLUNDOTMtNERGOS05QjY2LTVCMzczNDIzNTJGRUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":15484,"nextInTopic":15518,"prevInTime":15487,"nextInTime":15489,"topicId":15410,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But, to some extent, we tell the adults who come here *your<br/>\nideas are harmful and should be let go off and replaced with better<br/>\nideas*.    We don&#39;t tell them *Your ideas are right for you*, as we<br/>\nwould to our kids.   And then the adults can be puzzled and disturbed<br/>\nbecause they are not being trusted and encouraged quite the same way<br/>\nthat unschooled kids are.  That can seem inconsistent.  (But I think<br/>\nthe reason for that inconsistency is that the adults here have<br/>\nexperienced some brainwashing in school and also from our culture.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I think that&#39;s what people are expressing when they ask things<br/>\nlike *why can&#39;t I just unschool my own way -- how can your ideas be<br/>\nsuperior to mine -- why aren&#39;t my ideas just right for me?*<br/>\n<br/>\n**All of theunschooling families I know in real life have amazing and<br/>\ndeep ways of<br/>\nviewing the world and questioning just about EVERYTHING.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that some people were not allowed to question their parents<br/>\nas kids and that kind of insecurityof their parents can pass down to<br/>\nthem and make them feel that any kind of questioning shakes the<br/>\nfoundations of the world AND is rude.

I don&#39;t know<br/>\n  folks that are mindlessly accepting unschooling as another thing to<br/>\n  follow, yet I can see that it could happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyhoo, this topic came up on a local list, where someone that isn&#39;t<br/>\n  unschooling questioned us. I am importing this post where I answered<br/>\n  her, as a jumping off point for a discussion. Is unschooling just<br/>\n  another movement to follow for some folks? Or is it simply easier for<br/>\n  those that DON&#39;T want to question their own methods, to lump us all as<br/>\n  a mindless/elite group???<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here&#39;s the post (the first part is the OP, the answer was from me):<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~~~New to the group~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;But with that said, even while reading extensively about unschooling,<br/>\n  what I choose to do and how I do it still needs to be unique and<br/>\n  individual (like when my kids are learning) otherwise the unschooling<br/>\n  process becomes collective and associated with a shared belief system<br/>\n  that in my mind makes this a religious &quot;thinking&quot; group.- which<br/>\n  referrences any other educational system ---&gt; Is that a stretch? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes, it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to take a philosophy that says &quot;children<br/>\n  are natural learners, be respectful and trust them&quot; and make that a<br/>\n  &quot;collective&quot;!! Pretty funny to me because all of my unschooling<br/>\n  friends are SO incredibly diverse.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The one thing we have in common is the fact that we believe strongly<br/>\n  in trusting children and the learning process, other than that, how<br/>\n  much I have in common varies drastically. Families that share certain<br/>\n  values tend to become closer for obvious reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve met people that are so scared of fitting into anything, they&#39;ll<br/>\n  shun a group just because it&#39;s a group. That&#39;s acting out based on<br/>\n  fears. If I want to learn about beekeeping, should I fear a beekeepers<br/>\n  club? Actually, I&#39;d find it a useful place to learn and grow.<br/>\n  If I want to understand more about vegetarianism, I might attend a few<br/>\n  vegetarian socity potlucks or something. Any group or club has the<br/>\n  potential to assist my learning curve and I can use it in anyway that<br/>\n  suits my lifestyle. Being SO into &quot;rebellion&quot; or anti-group that you<br/>\n  discount any kind of group, is just silly to me. Use them for what you<br/>\n  need, forgo the rest. Unschooling isn&#39;t a club, it&#39;s just a bunch of<br/>\n  diverse people that agree on the idea that children learn naturally<br/>\n  and better without school.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling is simply a philosophy. How that philosophy plays out in<br/>\n  each home is SO amazingly different. In my home it is two working<br/>\n  parents, makeup, gardening, lotsa video gaming, hiking, traveling,<br/>\n  wine tasting, homemade food, big social life, environmental awareness,<br/>\n  writing, a Christian, a bunch of heathens and tons of art.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have atheist, christian, mormon, catholic, jewish, pagan/wiccan and<br/>\n  agnostic friends within the unschooling community. I have Indian (true<br/>\n  Indian, not Native America), African American, caucasian and friends<br/>\n  of Scottish descent...probably a lot of others but I never thought to<br/>\n  ask. Some of them are city dwellers, some are rural, some in between<br/>\n  like us. There&#39;s vegetarian&#39;s, hard-core junk food eaters and<br/>\n  everything in between. I can&#39;t think of a single unifying thought or<br/>\n  idea other than the part about giving children the same respect and<br/>\n  freedom that adults deserve. Yep, that spills over into how we parent<br/>\n  them in all areas. That&#39;s not exactly a collective, brainwashing kinda<br/>\n  system is it?<br/>\n<br/>\n  And yes, the unschooling parents I know (and I know a LOT) give<br/>\n  themselves as much freedom as their children. That&#39;s one of the things<br/>\n  we talk a LOT about when newbies come along. How it&#39;s really, really<br/>\n  important for parents to be pursuing the things they love, do that<br/>\n  which makes their soul sing. I believe unschooling is incredibly<br/>\n  healing for the parents in amazing ways. We get to have the childhood<br/>\n  we always imagined...it&#39;s never too late.<br/>\n<br/>\n  How much thought does it take to school a child? How much knee-jerk<br/>\n  reaction exists with implementing a curriculum or doing lessons<br/>\n  because it&#39;s comfortable?<br/>\n  To really trust and get comfortable with unschooling, it takes a HUGE<br/>\n  amount of questioning and change. All those shifts in thinking don&#39;t<br/>\n  come by simply doing what everyone else does or accepting what one is<br/>\n  told about schooling or how children learn best.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To become an unschooling parent, you have to dig deep and question<br/>\n  everything you do. To insinuate that there is some &quot;club&quot; of<br/>\n  unthinking followers seems pretty amusing to me. All of the<br/>\n  unschooling families I know in real life have amazing and deep ways of<br/>\n  viewing the world and questioning just about EVERYTHING. They<br/>\n  constantly help me learn and question MORE. It&#39;s very cool that way.~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling as a &quot;club&quot;","postDate":"1152217554","msgId":15418,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU4anJraStlaWU3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE5YTNlOTM5MzA1ZWY2Mjk2MjZmMGNhMzBjMTI4ZjVlQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":15414,"nextInTopic":15421,"prevInTime":15417,"nextInTime":15419,"topicId":15410,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I am importing this post where I answered<br/>\nher, as a jumping off point for a discussion. Is unschooling just<br/>\nanother movement to follow for some folks? Or is it simply easier for<br/>\nthose that DON&#39;T want to question their own methods, to lump us all as<br/>\na mindless/elite group???<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the post (the first part is the OP, the answer was from me):<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~New to the group~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But with that said, even while reading extensively about unschooling,<br/>\nwhat I choose to do and how I do it still needs to be unique and<br/>\nindividual (like when my kids are learning) otherwise the unschooling<br/>\nprocess becomes collective and associated with a shared belief system<br/>\nthat in my mind makes this a religious &quot;thinking&quot; group.- which<br/>\nreferrences any other educational system ---&gt; Is that a stretch? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to take a philosophy that says &quot;children<br/>\nare natural learners, be respectful and trust them&quot; and make that a<br/>\n&quot;collective&quot;!! Pretty funny to me because all of my unschooling<br/>\nfriends are SO incredibly diverse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing we have in common is the fact that we believe strongly<br/>\nin trusting children and the learning process, other than that, how<br/>\nmuch I have in common varies drastically.

Unschooling isn&#39;t a club, it&#39;s just a bunch of<br/>\ndiverse people that agree on the idea that children learn naturally<br/>\nand better without school.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is simply a philosophy. How that philosophy plays out in<br/>\neach home is SO amazingly different. In my home it is two working<br/>\nparents, makeup, gardening, lotsa video gaming, hiking, traveling,<br/>\nwine tasting, homemade food, big social life, environmental awareness,<br/>\nwriting, a Christian, a bunch of heathens and tons of art.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have atheist, christian, mormon, catholic, jewish, pagan/wiccan and<br/>\nagnostic friends within the unschooling community. I have Indian (true<br/>\nIndian, not Native America), African American, caucasian and friends<br/>\nof Scottish descent...probably a lot of others but I never thought to<br/>\nask. Some of them are city dwellers, some are rural, some in between<br/>\nlike us. There&#39;s vegetarian&#39;s, hard-core junk food eaters and<br/>\neverything in between. I can&#39;t think of a single unifying thought or<br/>\nidea other than the part about giving children the same respect and<br/>\nfreedom that adults deserve. Yep, that spills over into how we parent<br/>\nthem in all areas. That&#39;s not exactly a collective, brainwashing kinda<br/>\nsystem is it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, the unschooling parents I know (and I know a LOT) give<br/>\nthemselves as much freedom as their children. That&#39;s one of the things<br/>\nwe talk a LOT about when newbies come along. How it&#39;s really, really<br/>\nimportant for parents to be pursuing the things they love, do that<br/>\nwhich makes their soul sing. I believe unschooling is incredibly<br/>\nhealing for the parents in amazing ways. We get to have the childhood<br/>\nwe always imagined...it&#39;s never too late.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much thought does it take to school a child? How much knee-jerk<br/>\nreaction exists with implementing a curriculum or doing lessons<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s comfortable?<br/>\nTo really trust and get comfortable with unschooling, it takes a HUGE<br/>\namount of questioning and change. All those shifts in thinking don&#39;t<br/>\ncome by simply doing what everyone else does or accepting what one is<br/>\ntold about schooling or how children learn best.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo become an unschooling parent, you have to dig deep and question<br/>\neverything you do. To insinuate that there is some &quot;club&quot; of<br/>\nunthinking followers seems pretty amusing to me. All of the<br/>\nunschooling families I know in real life have amazing and deep ways of<br/>\nviewing the world and questioning just about EVERYTHING. They<br/>\nconstantly help me learn and question MORE. It&#39;s very cool that way.~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15485,"nextTopicId":15575}}
