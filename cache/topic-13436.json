Your child is 2!  Anyone who thinks a 2 <br/>\nyr. old should be in school shouldn&#39;t be labeling other people as <br/>\ncrazy!  <br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, I don&#39;t use the term unschooling too much.  We just say we <br/>\nhomeschool.  I haven&#39;t had anyone ask me about curriculum since we <br/>\nstopped using it but if they ask me, I&#39;ll just say that we&#39;re <br/>\neclectic and use a little of this and a little of that according to <br/>\nthe children&#39;s interests, which is true.  With a child as young as <br/>\nyours, I&#39;d be extremely confident in saying that we still have a ton <br/>\nof time before worrying about formal structure and we just live and <br/>\nlearn by playing together every day.  If the person wants to think <br/>\nyou crazy and not associate with you, then pretty likely that person <br/>\nhas nothing to offer you in friendship.  Or perhaps she&#39;s had people <br/>\ntalking to her about unschooling and it just scares the pants off <br/>\nher so her coping mechanism is to run away.  Either way, there&#39;s no <br/>\nreason for you to feel personally upset.  Just shake your head and <br/>\nmove on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve made few lasting friendships within a homeschooling circle.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve found that it&#39;s easier for people to &#39;hang&#39; together when they <br/>\nshare a common interest, and the majority of people I&#39;ve met don&#39;t <br/>\ncare that we share homeschooling.  They want to know you use the <br/>\nsame materials.  At some functions, I&#39;ve had women walk up to me, <br/>\nintroduce themselves and immediately ask me what curriculum I&#39;m <br/>\nusing.  When I don&#39;t give them the answer they want, they politely <br/>\nexcuse themselves and don&#39;t come back to me.  I have since had <br/>\nthe .... um... pleasure? of sitting with homeschoolers who share a <br/>\ncommon homeschooling curriculum.  They discuss curriculum the entire <br/>\ntime every single time they get together.  If they aren&#39;t discussing <br/>\nthe actual curriculum, they&#39;re discussing how to discipline their <br/>\nchildren to make them more obedient in doing their schoolwork.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, to be honest, I&#39;ve been one of those moms who sit around <br/>\ndiscussing curriculum all the time.  And now that I&#39;m no longer <br/>\nenamored of the stupid materials, I&#39;m less tolerant of being in a <br/>\ngroup that discusses those things.  If you haven&#39;t yet tried, you <br/>\nmay want to look for general homeschooling groups in your area.  You <br/>\nmight have more luck since people in a general group will use so <br/>\nmany different materials.  Also, if I need to, I will tell people <br/>\nI&#39;m using Sonlight, which is a literature based program.  It&#39;s not a <br/>\nlie, but I don&#39;t into details that we don&#39;t use the program as <br/>\ndesigned.  It really boils down to a super great list of books and <br/>\nas we love reading together, we get many great suggestions from the <br/>\ncatalog.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope you feel better soon.<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237503152,"authorName":"barndogzzz@wmconnect.com","from":"barndogzzz@...","profile":"artofthefire","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Upset need some support","postDate":"1148157640","msgId":13467,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4NS4zMzkwMWMxLjMxYTBkOGM4QHdtY29ubmVjdC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":13466,"nextInTopic":13471,"prevInTime":13466,"nextInTime":13468,"topicId":13436,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... crazy town when she asked me about preschool and i told her that we  where unschooling.

That&#39;s a really tough experience.  It&#39;s hard to realize this <br/>\nin the moment, but in retrospect I&#39;m always grateful to folks like <br/>\nthis who take themselves out of my life without me having to do any <br/>\nof the hard stuff.  I think they&#39;re really doing me a huge <br/>\nfavor.  Imagine if a relationship with such a frightened, <br/>\ninsensitive, judgmental, rude, impulsive person were to <br/>\ncontinue!  And, with kids involved!  Ugh!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess almost everything I do could be considered &quot;out there&quot; by the <br/>\nmainstream of our society.  A friend once said this to my <br/>\nhusband:  &quot;Whenever you are doing something that&#39;s out of the <br/>\nmainstream, it&#39;s imperative that you surround yourself with some kind <br/>\nof like-minded community that&#39;s also out of the mainstream, if only <br/>\nto keep your head straight about what you&#39;re doing and where you&#39;re going.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I found La Leche League meetings so crucial when my son <br/>\nwas younger, and that blossomed into other relationships that <br/>\nsupported our lifestyle choices.  I would say that most if not all of <br/>\nthe relationships we have had were with other families who co-slept <br/>\nwith their kids and did extended breastfeeding (we knew several <br/>\nfamilies with kids breastfeeding up to ages 5 and 6 and even <br/>\nbeyond!).  Many folks intended to homeschool and were at least able <br/>\nto converse about unschooling.  In fact, I first learned about <br/>\nunschooling at a group that grew out of a LLL group I was in when my <br/>\nson was still in-arms.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve really gone off on a little tangent here, but I guess the more <br/>\nyou can intentionally surround yourself with like-minded folks, the <br/>\neasier you will find it to stay on your path and feel good about your <br/>\nchoices.  This email discussion list and others like it are <br/>\nabsolutely crucial, in my opinion, even if you never post.  Even if <br/>\nwhat you do is out of the norm in mainstream society, it&#39;s YOUR norm, <br/>\nand that&#39;s all that matters.  If you can make it to any of the <br/>\nconferences, you&#39;ll be astounded at how easy it will be for you to <br/>\nfeel at home with hundreds of folks you&#39;ve never even met before!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea might be trying to get a regular weekly or monthly <br/>\nattachment parenting park day going (hanging up flyers in health-food <br/>\nstores and libraries) and seeing what kind of face-to-face community <br/>\nyou can build for yourself and the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a whole lot more info than you even asked for!  I hope it&#39;s a <br/>\nlittle helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nStay strong,<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji, a rather verbose woman who seems to be unable to end a post <br/>\nwithout some kind of a P.S.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.   I have also found that it&#39;s best to keep most information <br/>\nabout myself a little close to the vest until I get a good read on <br/>\nwhere folks are at.  All that stuff that I said earlier <br/>\nnotwithstanding, I prefer--if I can--to be the one to make a choice <br/>\nabout who is in my life.  Frankly, I prefer not to call attention to <br/>\nmyself and my out-of-the-mainstream ways unless I have some idea of <br/>\nthe other party&#39;s level of tolerance for such things.<br/>\n<br/>\n_.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gaiawolf.org/\">http://www.gaiawolf.org/</a>&gt;GaiaWolf<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The animals of this world exist for their own reasons.
