If you are not going to bed, and your dd doesn&#39;t want to, then let her stay up.  If you are going to bed yourself, invite dd to come w you, and I bet your sweet little thing will curl up next to her mama and doze right off.  <br/>\n  I don&#39;t want to &quot;beat you up&quot; but I want to express how badly I feel for little babies forced to wail alone in a room, unable to gain consolation or help.  She hasn&#39;t done anything wrong...probably knows mama can hear her screaming...but why doesn&#39;t mama help?  This has got to be so traumatic to a child and I can&#39;t imagine it makes any sense to them at all.  A Mama&#39;s job is to respond to her children, give them so much love and make them feel so safe, that they will still see the value of living in a less than perfect world...it is not the mama&#39;s job to teach children that the world can be cruel and lonely!<br/>\n   I also want to say that it takes extra time and can be frustrating, but it is so worth it to lie with or rock your child until she succumbs to sleep.  I am sorry you don&#39;t have the tool of nursing her to sleep, but maybe you could find a nice substitute...massage is my best idea.  If you want to try to work w a &quot;bedtime routine,&quot; I would suggest making it the best part of her day, with as many books as she wants and conversation and love and connection w her mama who helps her to sleep.  BTW, I don&#39;t think there is any possible way you could &quot;force her to sleep.&quot;  You can lock her in her room to scream, but I implore you to please don&#39;t!  Make the investment in your child&#39;s happiness and well being and spend the extra time and wait with her until she is asleep.  If she doesn&#39;t nod off, then get back up w her for a while.   <br/>\n  I am glad you are here and are committed to helping your child and that you have decided that giving her the cold shoulder at bedtime isn&#39;t right.   It IS hard and frustrating sometimes to help them to sleep, but so much better for us to endure this frustration as part of the job than to force our children to feel unloved and alone as they transition to sleep.  I will stop now.<br/>\n  Good luck in your new way of parenting to sleep!<br/>\nMillie<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 24 messages in this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nTopics in this digest:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.

Some favorites: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith, which has a silly nursing story, but I loved this book and also Joy in the Morning by the same author; Vanity Fair, by Sinclair Lewis, Delta Wedding, by Eudora Welty, The Cider House Rules and The World According to Garp, by John Irving, She&#39;s Come Undone, by Wally Lamb, The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe, as well as ALL of his novels were excellent...The Bonfire of the Vanities, can&#39;t seem to remember the title of the one I liked best. Also, if you haven&#39;t read Tom Robbins, he is awesome; check out Still Life With Woodpecker and Skinny Legs and All.<br/>\nAnd then there was Steinbeck; I think I read everything he wrote and I thoroughly enjoyed them all...read Grapes of Wrath, Pastures of Heaven, oooh there are SO MANY excellent books by John Steinbeck. OH YEAH and I also recommend Prodigal Summer by Barbara Kingsolver.

My suggestions would be, <br/>\nask him if he would teach you how to fish, take him to fishing <br/>\nrodeos (we have them here), get online with him and find fishing <br/>\nbooks at Amazon or half.com. In other words, let him know that you <br/>\ntake his fishing passion seriously and that you&#39;re willing to do <br/>\nwhatever it takes to help him pursue the fishing. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe fishing will become a lifestyle for him, maybe fishing is his <br/>\nescape, maybe he just loves the quietness of fishing ( LOTS of <br/>\nthinking goes on when a person is fishing), maybe he&#39;ll someday <br/>\ncreate a television show around his fishing technique or maybe he&#39;ll <br/>\nimmerse himself totally into fishing and it&#39;ll lead to something <br/>\nelse. No way to know just yet. <br/>\n<br/>\nWould you learn how to handle the boat so that the two of you could <br/>\ngo off together and fish? What an incredibly spiritual adventure <br/>\nthat could be. Mom and Jon fishing quietly on the water. Sounds <br/>\nheavenly to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about hosting a fishing party for Jon and one or two of his <br/>\nfriends? My dad took me and 5 other teenage girls crabbing from his <br/>\nboat one time. It&#39;s one of my fondest childhood memories. And he <br/>\nreally shone with patience. Imagine SIX teen girls in a boat in the <br/>\nmiddle of the water! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are so many ways to fish, so many different types of fish <br/>\nto catch. Fishing from the boat, the shore, deepsea fishing, etc. My <br/>\ndad has a million passions, but fishing is number one with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of looking for things that you might feel he SHOULD have a <br/>\npassion about, go with the one he already has. Fishing is an art and <br/>\nif more teen boys could sit still long enough to fish, they&#39;d <br/>\nprobably be a lot more content.

I don&#39;t feed my animals on a schedule. We use autofeeders <br/>\nand the food is available all the time. None of my pets are overweight, but I <br/>\nwould guess if I had one that woofed its food down that I&#39;d think twice about <br/>\nautofeeders. But I&#39;d probably leave it out and see if the dog would ever <br/>\nget full. I&#39;d bet it would relax after a while and not be so crazed about <br/>\ngetting it all. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son and his wife have rescued 3 cats, and everyone of them are really, <br/>\nreally overweight now. They dole out the food once or twice a day, and it&#39;s <br/>\neven weightloss food. The cats don&#39;t eat it all at once. But they live in a <br/>\nsmall 1 bedroom apartment, so the cats don&#39;t have as much room to roam as mine <br/>\ndo. My son and I are trying to figure out why his cats are so fat (all <br/>\nabout the same age) and mine are not. I think it has to do with the very idea <br/>\nthat the food supply is controlled for his cats and not for mine. I think his <br/>\ncats eat more because they know sometimes the bowl gets empty, and they never <br/>\nknow when it might be their turn to visit the bowl after the last cat just <br/>\nate the last morsel. So they gobble. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur house is open to the pets. We have a pet door into the kitchen, and <br/>\nthey have the whole acre lot fenced in for their to use. (The cats don&#39;t stay <br/>\nin the fence, though.) My dog would leave the yard and visit around the <br/>\nneighborhood if there weren&#39;t a fence, but she&#39;d come back because she knows where <br/>\nher bed is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re about as AP as you can be with animals, but they ARE animals, and <br/>\nnot children. <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 9 <br/>\nDate: Thu, 19 Aug 2004 16:32:24 +0200<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ulrike Haupt&quot; <br/>\nSubject: about fishing<br/>\n<br/>\nHi<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my brothers was what we then called a &#39;Zappelphillip&#39;.

They are dogs, not children. They <br/>\nare den animals and prefer a &#39;covered&#39; place of their own---something <br/>\n&#39;den-like&#39;. Crates fit the bill.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people don&#39;t know much about dogs. They don&#39;t understand <br/>\nage-appropriate or instinctive or breed-specific behaviors. They act as if they are <br/>\nchildren. They aren&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dogs love their crates. Ryan will have his in the car (like a safety belt <br/>\nfor dogs) and in the hotel room. You&#39;re welcome to witness it! They&#39;ll <br/>\nall nap in their crates with the doors open. It&#39;s a safe place---and should <br/>\nALWAYS be treated as such. Flying on airplanes is *easy* when the dog is <br/>\ncrate-trained. Often traumatic when not. Visiting friends and famiily who aren&#39;t <br/>\ndog-friendly is also easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nScheduling the puppy is not so much for the puppy&#39;s sake (other than to <br/>\navoid human wrath), as for the human&#39;s. Potty training is easier when you know <br/>\nwhen he&#39;ll have to pee or poop----scoot him outside as soon as you can. He <br/>\nlearns where to &#39;go&#39; and can get praised for it. Praise for going outside is <br/>\nperferable to pissing you off for going inside---and being on the receiving end <br/>\nof a &#39;white-carpet-rant&#39;. It&#39;s also using a natural tendency to not soil where <br/>\nhe sleeps-----he won&#39;t soil his crate, and so will naturally &quot;hold it&quot; until <br/>\nhe&#39;s let out of the crate and directly into the yard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe easiest way to train a dog is to use his natural tendencies/instincts to <br/>\nour advantage. That&#39;s how we got herding dogs and hunting dogs----herding, <br/>\npointing, retrieving are all &#39;parts&#39; of the natural hunting drive----watch <br/>\nwolves hunt in a pack; they used all this communication to work together. <br/>\nTerriers instinctively dig and hunt. Hounds use their noses or eyes to trail and <br/>\nhunt. Humans have just made the best of them by honing them to our needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the most part, we&#39;ve left strict obedience behind in favor of &quot;house <br/>\nmanners&quot;----more unschooly. But still, we know what&#39;s instinctive and how to <br/>\nwork WITH that, not against it.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 12 <br/>\nDate: Thu, 19 Aug 2004 13:26:30 -0400<br/>\nFrom: Vijay Berry Owens <br/>\nSubject: Re: ADD (was about fishing)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I don&#39;t get about my stepbrother (15) being diagnosed ADD or <br/>\nADHD can&#39;t recall which.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis boy is *brilliant* (not to say you can&#39;t be smart and still have <br/>\nADD) and spends hours playing violin (he studies every Saturday at <br/>\nJuilliard) can play video games ALL DAY and can take anything (clocks, <br/>\nanswering machines, cameras) apart and put it painstakingly back <br/>\ntogether again.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is this a deficit of attention???

I am looking<br/>\nfor some help.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I haven&#39;t been known to ever beat anyone up...but I might <br/>\nquestion you.:)<br/>\nApparently you know in your heart there is a better way, I sense <br/>\nthat. Crying it out is a bad idea in my opinion. It&#39;s rare that I <br/>\nlet a child cry, the exception is when they&#39;re trying to hit me, <br/>\neven then I try to offer comfort at a safe distance and ask them <br/>\nwhen they&#39;re ready to be held.<br/>\nAnyhoo...that&#39;s not your question.<br/>\nI think your little Emma has a very different sleep schedule of her <br/>\nown, most people&#39;s bio-rhythms are going to be different, even in <br/>\nthe same house. The challenge is for you to try and adapt YOUR sleep <br/>\nneeds to hers. I feel like it&#39;s our job when children are very small <br/>\nand need an adult to be with them while they&#39;re awake for safety <br/>\nreasons. It&#39;s not easy, but who said raising children would be easy, <br/>\nright?:)<br/>\nI&#39;ve found myself up much later than I would have liked many nights, <br/>\nbecause Jalen is very much like your Emma. He needed to be up later, <br/>\nhe needed to wake up and nurse frequently (he&#39;s just starting to <br/>\nslow that down a bit at 3.5 years old) and is generally a high needs <br/>\nperson. It&#39;s exhausting sometimes. There are days I fervently wish <br/>\nhe were older, then I look at that sweet, chubby toddler face and <br/>\nundo that wish very quickly....small children are oh-so-sweet.<br/>\nMy advice is to be with her, wait until she really IS ready to lay <br/>\ndown, and then snuggle up for nighttime sleeping. You may even have <br/>\nto wait until she&#39;s falling asleep wherever she is, and cover her up <br/>\nor move her.<br/>\nI think adults should try their best to work their own sleep needs <br/>\naround their childrens when they are so young...later on, you can <br/>\nsay &quot;No, I&#39;m too tired to stay up and play another game&quot; and they&#39;ll <br/>\nunderstand. Babies and toddlers just need someone to be with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I am wondering, is do you sleep with her? Children <br/>\nsleep much better next to a human body, it&#39;s how we&#39;re programmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150688296,"authorName":"Kiersten Pasciak","from":"&quot;Kiersten Pasciak&quot; &lt;kjl8@...&gt;","profile":"kierstenpasciak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Sleep self-regulation at young ages (LONG)","postDate":"1092960175","msgId":2870,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNnM2YzZitudDBoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2873,"prevInTime":2869,"nextInTime":2871,"topicId":2870,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I am new to this board and have been reading the posts to learn more about unschooling as well as reading lots of books from the library. The ideas","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-713108596\">Hi,<br/>\nI am new to this board and have been reading the posts to learn more <br/>\nabout unschooling as well as reading lots of books from the library.<br/>\nThe ideas expressed sound very logical to me, but are challenging a <br/>\ngreat deal of what I believed up until now. (In a good way...I truly <br/>\nfeel that children should be treated with dignity and respect and <br/>\nallowed to make their own choices) <br/>\n<br/>\nThe major issue I am having trouble with is sleep self-regulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a SAHM to a 14 month old DD (Emma) and a 2 3/4 year old DS <br/>\n(Jacob). When Jacob was about 10 months old, we followed <br/>\nthe &quot;Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child&quot; method to get him to sleep <br/>\nwhen WE felt he was tired. This is a modified cry-it-out method <br/>\nwhich focuses on paying close attention to when the child is getting <br/>\ndrowsy, following a short routine, and putting him to bed before he <br/>\ngets overtired and upset. With Jacob, he cried 5 minutes or less and <br/>\nthen slept soundly through the night, waking up happy and energetic. <br/>\nThe arguments in the book focused on your child NEEDING enough sleep <br/>\nto learn effectively and thrive. We bought into it and were <br/>\nsatisfied that although we were not entirely comfortable with the <br/>\ncrying part of the method, it seemed to work. Jacob has been very in <br/>\ntune with our bedtime routine for years now, and happily goes to <br/>\nsleep after we read and tuck him in. <br/>\n<br/>\nSkip to our second child, Emma.<br/>\nEmma has almost never been willing to wind down in any manner, no <br/>\nmatter how we have tried to time it nor how consistent we have been <br/>\nwith our bedtime routine. She is not comforted by being held or <br/>\nrocked or sung to. She just squirms to get down and play. She will <br/>\nsit and read books with us, but will continue to hand us one after <br/>\nanother after another, never being content to stop. When we do <br/>\nfinally stop, she screams as though she is being physically hurt. <br/>\nShe is 14 months now and it is turning into a power struggle for us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been reading about respecting your children&#39;s feelings about <br/>\nwhen they are hungry and when they are tired and am finally starting <br/>\nto believe that we have deeply underestimated her. However, I have <br/>\nconcerns about how to practically make this work with a child so <br/>\nyoung. I trust our kids to be anywhere in our house while we are <br/>\nawake, but would be concerned to allow one of them to be up after my <br/>\nhusband and I go to bed. I am unsure how to balance our individual <br/>\nneeds for sleep and time alone together and time off with our <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s seeming need to be awake and explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess my questions are...<br/>\nIs 14 months old enough to self-regulate?<br/>\nIf you have experience with this, how did it work for you?<br/>\nMy main concern is that she will be overtired and not function well <br/>\nduring the day.<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to &quot;force her to sleep&quot;<br/>\nShe, even now, has the ability to play quietly or look at books or <br/>\nmove around when in her room. She sleeps on a mattress on the floor.<br/>\nIf we close the door, she screams and screams until we either bring <br/>\nher out to be with us or falls asleep eventually. I do not want to <br/>\ncontinue this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t beat me up for letting her cry. I have been unable to <br/>\nfigure out a gentle way to get her to relax and sleep. I am looking <br/>\nfor some help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions or experiences you can offer would be greatly <br/>\nappreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKiersten</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2877,"nextTopicId":2884}}
