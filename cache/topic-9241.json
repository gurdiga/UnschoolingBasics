Teachers and parents have<br/>\nsaid too much TV is &quot;bad.&quot;   And after years of negative brainwashing<br/>\nabout TV people get comfortable blaming the TV for choices *they* make. <br/>\n( I watched this movie instead of cleaning house, TV is like a drug!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nEducators at first thought TV was going to be a great tool of education. <br/>\n But a population of depression weary, war weary and post war Americans<br/>\nfound that TV entertainment was a delight in their joy starved lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPretty soon, teachers discovered kids would rather talk about the latest<br/>\nepisode of their favorite program then about William Henry Harrison and<br/>\nwould rather watch TV then do their homework.   But that&#39;s not a problem<br/>\nwith TV.  The problem all along was with boring teachers, mind numbing<br/>\ncurriculum, compulsory school attendance and the pointless busy work of<br/>\nhomework.  <br/>\n<br/>\nParents found out kids would rather watch their favorite programs than do<br/>\nchores or homework.  That&#39;s not a problem with TV,  that&#39;s a problem with<br/>\ninconsiderate parents and you know, that homework thing again. <br/>\n<br/>\nTeachers told parents, &quot;Limit that TV time&quot; because they had to get kids<br/>\nto do homework.   Parents told kids &quot;That TV is turning you into a<br/>\nzombie!&quot; because kids liked  what the people on TV were saying more than<br/>\nwhat their nagging mom was saying. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a kid grows up in a &quot;do this, do that&quot; household with week after week<br/>\nof  &quot;do this, do that&quot; school, he&#39;d have to be an idiot not to want<br/>\nsomething fun and wonderful of his own choosing.     <br/>\n<br/>\nIs TV really the problem if a mom is nagging, demeaning a child&#39;s choices<br/>\nand badgering a kid to do something he doesn&#39;t want to do?  Is TV the<br/>\nproblem if a mom&#39;s telling a kid outright or in subtle ways he&#39;s weak<br/>\nminded if he&#39;s watching  TV?   Is TV really the problem if it&#39;s more<br/>\npleasant than the controlling, demanding adults in a child&#39;s life? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think year after year kids grow up hearing how bad TV is.  TV is the<br/>\nreason they won&#39;t clean their room.   TV is the reason they won&#39;t set the<br/>\ntable.  TV is the reason they&#39;re failing history.   TV is the reason they<br/>\nwon&#39;t listen to their moms.   So they reach adulthood, feeling guilty<br/>\nover whatever little pleasure TV brings, having learned by example to<br/>\nblame TV,  and vowing not to let evil TV ruin their kid&#39;s lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know what people say about TV.   Their kids are cranky if they watch<br/>\ntoo much.  I&#39;d like everyone who ever said that to look at the dynamic<br/>\nbetween parent and child and see what else is going on because there&#39;s<br/>\nalmost always something else.  Almost always one or both parents has a<br/>\nnegative attitude about TV and makes negative comments about TV in the<br/>\npresence of their children and is making it hard for a child to just<br/>\npeacefully enjoy TV.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAs adults I&#39;m sure all of us have had what we thought was a great idea<br/>\nand had someone shoot it down.  Nothing will make a person cop an<br/>\nattitude faster than that feeling of being judged and found lacking by<br/>\nsomeone we love.   Parents do that to kids in regards to TV (and other<br/>\nthings) all the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know it&#39;s always easier to blame something else if our kids seem<br/>\nunhappy or cranky but it will benefit every family member if as parents<br/>\nwe look to our own actions and behaviors first and consider how those<br/>\nactions infuse our kid&#39;s environment with negative or positive energy.   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196090915,"authorName":"jnjstau@direcway.com","from":"jnjstau@...","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] beekeeping WAS: Question about TV","postDate":"1137897901","msgId":9500,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2MjAzM2UyNjIyOGMzLjI2MjI4YzMyNjIwMzNlQGRpcmVjd2F5LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":9491,"nextInTopic":9543,"prevInTime":9499,"nextInTime":9501,"topicId":9241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My bees are coming in April.

How unschooling looks will be different with each<br/>\nfamily. No problems there. But TV isn&#39;t just another option if you refer to<br/>\nit as the &quot;boob tube&quot;. This is a very negative connotation. This will be<br/>\nreflected in the how much and what kind of an option it is to your kids. TV<br/>\ncan be a wonderful tool. It can be the source of a lot of learning. It can<br/>\nbe a much need way to relax and unwind. It can be a great bonding time.<br/>\nSometimes it is watched a lot, sometimes a little, every family will be<br/>\ndifferent. Even within our family we go in cycles and seasons. Sometimes we<br/>\ncan go days without it on, other times it&#39;s on all the time. Either way is<br/>\njust as acceptable and never is it referred to in a derogatory way. How it<br/>\nis referred to is a much bigger issue and concern than how much or little it<br/>\nis watched. How do the kids feel when they really want to watch something,<br/>\nbut knowing to you it is a less desirable and good option. They might watch<br/>\nit, but they will keep with them the knowledge that Mom thinks this it&#39;s is<br/>\njust a &#39;boob tube&#39; and doesn&#39;t have any real value. Then they live with the<br/>\nidea that something they like and want doesn&#39;t have value to Mom.  That&#39;s<br/>\nnot &#39;just another option&#39;, now it&#39;s a lesser choice or a bad choice<br/>\naccording to Mom.

My kids learn so much form TV.  Right this minute they are watchinga History channel show about Houdinni.  I hear gasps of WOW, that is cool, Hey mom, come look at this  etc...  They had not heard of Houdinni before today, they were scrolling through the tv guide and one asked mom, who is Houdinni (thye even need help reading the name, but I was there for that!)  I gave a brief explanation based on what I knew.  They were curious, they wanted to watch, they learned, tv was the tool.   True learning happens when kids get to interact with stuff that is meaningful to them.  Tv is just one tool in making that happen.  It makes their world bigger, it seems to me, lack of tv would make their world smaller.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Ann<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

Just as ice cream or chocolate are no more or less <br/>\nthan a part of a whole balance of eating. Developing healthfully is <br/>\nlearning balance of things, not separating out certain things as &quot;bad <br/>\nfor you&quot; or &quot;only a little bit now and then&quot;. There are times when I <br/>\nwant lots of chocolate, so I eat lots of chocolate. There are times <br/>\nwhen one or two individual chocolate morsels is plenty and there are <br/>\ntimes when I&#39;d rather have strawberries. Just so, there are times when <br/>\nI want lots of TV, times when I watch one or two favorites and that&#39;s <br/>\nall and times when I am doing other things entirely. Balance. By <br/>\nsetting TV (or ice cream or cake or video games) out as something that <br/>\nhas to be rationed and earned (by finishing all the peas or reading 2 <br/>\nchapters or spending an hour out in the yard), it sets those things <br/>\napart as more desirable *because* they are rationed. (BTW have you <br/>\never considered the whole &#39;finish all your supper before you have <br/>\ndessert concept? Basically what it is saying is fill yourself up and <br/>\nthen you can have what you want, but by that time you&#39;re full, but you <br/>\nstill want the cookie so you over fill - seems like if you just ate as <br/>\nmuch peas and as much chicken and as much cookie as you wanted it <br/>\nwould all balance without over eating). DS calls ice cream et <br/>\nal &#39;dessert&#39; since that&#39;s what it is called in the larger culture <br/>\n(check a restaurant menu for instance). However, if he chooses, he can <br/>\nhave ice cream and then have a sandwich or can have both at the same <br/>\ntime (except the ice cream tends to get melty if he&#39;s going back and <br/>\nforth). Manys the time that I&#39;ve brought a double chocolate donut home <br/>\nfrom work (when our summer interns leave, for instance, tradition is <br/>\nthat they bring donuts on their last day. I&#39;ll grab one and bring it <br/>\nhome for DS). When I get home from work, dinner is usually cooking if <br/>\nnot ready already. I&#39;ll give him the donut. Sometimes he saves it <br/>\nuntil after eating whatever is for dinner. Other times he eats the <br/>\nwhole thing right away. And sometimes he&#39;ll eat part then eat dinner <br/>\nthen eat the rest. Since it has no greater or lesser weight than <br/>\nanything else, no emotional ties, no hint of &#39;forbidden or <br/>\nrestricted&#39;, he eats it as he chooses when he chooses in response to <br/>\nwhat his body says at the time. Of the three of us (me, DH, and DS) DS <br/>\nis the most likely to eat one cookie and stop or leave a dish of ice <br/>\ncream half eaten because he is done eating ice cream.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame for TV - he watches when he wants, what he wants, and when he is <br/>\ndone, he moves to something else (and often he&#39;s doing something else <br/>\nin the middle of TV watching also) and vice versa - when he&#39;s done <br/>\ninthe yard or playing with Legos or whatever (when he&#39;s filled up on <br/>\nhow much of it he wants) he can move to TV or video games if he <br/>\nchooses, if he has a &#39;taste&#39; for it. Of us all, he is the least likely <br/>\nto &#39;veg out&#39; in front of the TV. He&#39;ll leave the room or turn it off <br/>\nor simply ignore it (as he chooses) when he doesn&#39;t find anything he <br/>\nwants to watch, whereas DH and I will flip channels back and forth <br/>\nrather than turn it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, in food and TV and other things, we&#39;re learning a lot about <br/>\nbalance and listening to our insides from DS and we&#39;re getting better <br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Question about TV","postDate":"1137677629","msgId":9272,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDN0VCMTQxRDJEMkNDRS0yMzgtMkQyNUBtYmxrLXIxNS5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEYxNzdEQkNCLTg4OEUtNEUxRi1BRjYzLTNCNTgyMTE2RDZEOUBjb3gubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGRxbW9kYSs5NWZ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RjE3N0RCQ0ItODg4RS00RTFGLUFGNjMtM0I1ODIxMTZENkQ5QGNveC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":9266,"nextInTopic":9273,"prevInTime":9271,"nextInTime":9273,"topicId":9241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My son was on TV overdose when I decided to embrace radical unschooling.  He really is becoming self-regulated with respect to TV watching.  At age 5 yrs he will tell me that he is bored with TV.  This is after being regulated somewhat to quite a bit up until that point.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that when I stopped caring about how much TV he watches, that the TV became an instant nonissue.  I will say that when he is in TV all the time mode, I feel it is because there is nothing more interesting going on.  When I am doing interesting things that may or may be directed to my sons, they watch less TV.  I have often heard on this list that it really is all about the parents getting into their children&#39;s worlds.  I think that is the case at times with my son.  If we are engaging each other, he watches less TV or at least talks throughout the entire program, which helps me to realized how great he is as an oral communicator and how well his memory is because he can tell stories verbatim.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you much success on your unschooling journey. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  Does<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; anyone feel that way about TV (that it is addictive and not<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; particularly healthy for anyone and should be treated as &quot;dessert&quot;?)<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Question about TV","postDate":"1137643683","msgId":9256,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxNzdEQkNCLTg4OEUtNEUxRi1BRjYzLTNCNTgyMTE2RDZEOUBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRxbW9kYSs5NWZ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRxbW9kYSs5NWZ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9251,"nextInTopic":9257,"prevInTime":9255,"nextInTime":9257,"topicId":9241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Keep the power out of tv by setting a different example yourself.

I&#39;m not waiting for<br/>\nmy kids to &#39;cut back&#39; on tv.  They are free to watch as much or as little as<br/>\nthey want. Most of the time I watch more than they do (I like having it on<br/>\nfor background noise).<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you get from sugar and caffeine to cocain? I do not limit sugar or<br/>\ncaffeine and I have yet to have to decide whether to sit by and let my<br/>\nchildren try cocain. There isn&#39;t a connection. And even though I don&#39;t limit<br/>\nsugar and caffeine, none of my kids eat them excessivly most of the time. In<br/>\nfact, they probably eat healthier than the average kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter how much or little tv my kids watch, how much or little<br/>\nsugar, caffeine or anything else they consume. These amounts don&#39;t effect<br/>\nhow much parenting my kids get. They get all the parenting I can give them<br/>\nwhatever they are doing, whatever they are interested in, whatever they need<br/>\nat any given time.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are not trusting your kids to regulate themselves.
