Check with your local community colleges to see if they have classes that interest her, for instance (and while you&#39;re at it see if any would interest your son). Check with local state parks and museums, too. They could be things the two of you do together, like a canoeing course or something for her for fun like paper making. If she likes anime, go on a tour of local comic book shops and see if they have any clubs or small classes that interest her. Also, there are comic book programs - my 9yo has a fairly simple one that came with some movie or other, so I&#39;m sure you can find others that are cheap and free. (Maybe someone has a link... Alex????)<br/>\n<br/>\nBe sure to let her know that its okay to do things for the fun of it. She may be getting stressed out by the idea that she&#39;s supposed to find a passion or choose a life&#39;s work and that&#39;s getting in the way of her playing around and figuring out what&#39;s interesting right now. Lots of kids get all tangled up in the idea that they Have To Pick Something by the time they&#39;re out of high school and that something had better be perfect because that&#39;s their life&#39;s work - and in reality that&#39;s not the case at all. It might help her to meet some people who&#39;ve changed professions more than once as a way of calming down from the idea that she has to choose something Right Now - it might help you, too! A good place to find people like that are to look in artistic fields, too - go on an art crawl, watch the extras in some animated movies, go to some musical event and chat with people. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s important, though, to also be sensitive to the fact that you&#39;ve set her up to believe school is an answer (best of intentions, I know! my 17yo lived through some of my &quot;best intentions&quot;). So if she&#39;s really wanting school, look for ways to make that a better experience for her. It doesn&#39;t have to &quot;eat her alive&quot; but she&#39;ll need a lot of your help and support for that to happen, and maybe some out-of-the-box solutions, too, like going to school part time  or doing her homework for her (not &quot;helping her with her homework&quot; but actually doing it) if that&#39;s something she thinks will help her focus on the social experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith all that, don&#39;t forget your younger son! He doesn&#39;t have to wait to do some of the things mechanical engineers do - find out what really turns him on and look for some out of the box ways for him to do that Right Now. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163621138,"authorName":"odiniella","from":"&quot;odiniella&quot; &lt;hgaimari@...&gt;","profile":"odiniella","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: idea and question","postDate":"1299100766","msgId":46274,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlrbWM4dSthNnI4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlrbTdrbSt2ZjBpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46273,"nextInTopic":46275,"prevInTime":46273,"nextInTime":46275,"topicId":46265,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... have all just gone through a very difficult year.

She feels she&#39;s not doing enough without it and I feel at a loss as to how to provide an alternative, but clearly it&#39;s not working so well for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll check out these links next.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I suspect the bigger issue is that you don&#39;t know how to relate to her.

I&#39;m brand new to this forum and kinda, almost, sorta new<br/>\n&gt; to the idea of unschooling.  I wonder if I can run my idea past you to<br/>\n&gt; see if I&#39;m understanding this right, and to ask a question.  But I<br/>\n&gt; should warn you, I&#39;m annoyingly long winded and frightfully boring.  I<br/>\n&gt; just thought I&#39;d put that upfront. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I say kinda, almost, sorta new because I started unschooling by default.<br/>\n&gt; Well, I started homeschooling by default and that turned into<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.  I don&#39;t know that I can really take much from that<br/>\n&gt; experience because it involves a son with Asperger&#39;s who is freakishly<br/>\n&gt; brilliant in some ways and unfathomably defiant in others and it turned<br/>\n&gt; out that for the sake of our family&#39;s sanity, I stopped &quot;requiring&quot;<br/>\n&gt; anything from him.  Oh, and he has a frightful case of extreme anxiety<br/>\n&gt; so it&#39;s not like I just let my kids run feral (well, not always, okay,<br/>\n&gt; but only when I can too and we&#39;re all having fun).  Eventually his<br/>\n&gt; anxiety and depression were more than we could care for at home and he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; now in a therapeutic boarding school and doing really well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But he&#39;s an anomaly.  What he lacks in social skills and graces he makes<br/>\n&gt; up for in scientific knowledge.  Apparently he&#39;s quite the computer wiz<br/>\n&gt; too.  Good gravy where did he learn it all?  I know those of you who<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t nodded off to sleep yet are thinking, Yep, he learned it because<br/>\n&gt; he had the time to explore it.  And that&#39;s probably so.  But where I get<br/>\n&gt; concerned is that <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A) he&#39;s not typical.  No kid gets his panties in a wad<br/>\n&gt; at age 10 because his DK book on physiology doesn&#39;t explain the Kreb&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Cycle in enough detail.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And B) he has no idea about anything other than<br/>\n&gt; science and computers.  He doesn&#39;t care and now he&#39;s in a school where<br/>\n&gt; he will learn basics like what a World War is and there are 7<br/>\n&gt; continents and the Middle East and Africa and the Americas used to be<br/>\n&gt; personal playthings of European monarchs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But I have two more now and here&#39;s my idea that I wanted to run past you<br/>\n&gt; all to see if I have this right.  My youngest son came home last year. <br/>\n&gt; It was a very stressful year for my oldest (not only were all his<br/>\n&gt; siblings home now, but his grandfather was dying and that was very hard<br/>\n&gt; for him to process).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We watched tv and read books and hung out at home<br/>\n&gt; (not lots of field trips because of behaviors from oldest either out in<br/>\n&gt; public or left home alone).  It turned out that youngest son liked WWII<br/>\n&gt; stuff so we got books from the library.  Well, not so much WWII but the<br/>\n&gt; tanks and airplanes.  Okay, the tanks and airplanes were cool, but not<br/>\n&gt; nearly as cool as the stuff they made on Mythbusters!  We had a very<br/>\n&gt; Mythbuster&#39;s year last year and learned from oldest where they got<br/>\n&gt; sloppy with &quot;real&quot; scientific methodology and youngest got inspired with<br/>\n&gt; making stuff.  After watching these kinds of shows like Mythbusters and<br/>\n&gt; Junkyard Wars and the like, and watching youtube videos, he announced to<br/>\n&gt; me the other day he knows what kind of engineer he wants to be -<br/>\n&gt; mechanical engineer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   So my idea is that I point him in that direction,<br/>\n&gt; right?  How I do that, I don&#39;t know. Until this year, I thought<br/>\n&gt; &quot;engineer&quot; and saw Dilbert in my head.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I expect that as he gets older we&#39;ll explore what colleges have good<br/>\n&gt; programs and what their requirements are and he&#39;ll be motivated to show<br/>\n&gt; them he is a good applicant.  Is that right?  That&#39;s my idea.  Do I have<br/>\n&gt; that right?  What am I missing?  How do I help him get the foundation<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;ll need to apply to college? I only ask now because I can&#39;t conceive<br/>\n&gt; how two or three years in high school, when he&#39;s thinking about it, will<br/>\n&gt; be enough.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And now my question. My daughter (she&#39;s 13, 8th grade) is really frustrating me.  Oh no, not HER.  She&#39;s fabulous! <br/>\n&gt; I love her to pieces!  She&#39;s sweet and kind and thoughtful and creative.<br/>\n&gt; But she has NO IDEA what she wants to do with her time.  We are going<br/>\n&gt; through a classical education curriculum now (mostly for husband&#39;s piece<br/>\n&gt; of mind, but also as a spring board for me) and she tells me she doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; like unschooling.  She does NOT like having no structure or routine. <br/>\n&gt; She likes to be organized and efficient thankyouverymuch.  But when I<br/>\n&gt; say it&#39;s time to start language arts and here&#39;s what we&#39;ll be working on<br/>\n&gt; with composition...she gets silly and distracting.  Or she won&#39;t come to<br/>\n&gt; the table.  Or she won&#39;t know what to write about. In other words, she says she likes a traditional school<br/>\n&gt; experience but her behavior tells me the opposite.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    I don&#39;t know how to help her because she doesn&#39;t know what she wants. <br/>\n&gt; She likes to read, but she doesn&#39;t want to read all day.  She likes to<br/>\n&gt; decorate cakes so we signed her up for a cake decorating class.  That<br/>\n&gt; was fun, now she&#39;s done.  This week she&#39;s painting her bedroom.  Next<br/>\n&gt; week what will she do?  She walks around the house saying &quot;What can we<br/>\n&gt; do today? Can we go somewhere?&quot;  I don&#39;t know if she wants to go to the<br/>\n&gt; mall and hang out because that&#39;s what teens do in her books or if she<br/>\n&gt; likes to look at the fashions or she wants to spend money (sorry babe,<br/>\n&gt; wrong mom for that). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;ve suggested taking clothes from the thrift<br/>\n&gt; stores and modify them but she&#39;s not interested.  She likes to draw but<br/>\n&gt; says she&#39;s NOT an artist, she&#39;s a doodler.  Well, she&#39;s got a pretty<br/>\n&gt; sweet little style if you ask me, even if it is typical anime, she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; picked it up well and it&#39;s lovely.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s just not focused and doesn&#39;t know what to do with her time.  She<br/>\n&gt; also has some anxiety issues (living in the shadow of an unpredictable<br/>\n&gt; older brother isn&#39;t for the weak) and so doesn&#39;t want to do things<br/>\n&gt; alone.  Most kids her age go into high school  so<br/>\n&gt; she talks about going into high school because she&#39;s lonely.  Only, I<br/>\n&gt; think the academics would eat her up and, I&#39;m afraid, be a blow to her<br/>\n&gt; self-esteem (which is just NOW starting to thrive after taking a<br/>\n&gt; crushing from having such difficulties in school less than three years<br/>\n&gt; ago).  I really like our classical education curriculum. Yeah, clearly, this is the best curriculum....for ME. <br/>\n&gt; I love it.  My kids?  meh<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I don&#39;t mind tweaking it to keep kids happy and  husband comfortable<br/>\n&gt; until eventually we see that the kids are learning even if we don&#39;t sit<br/>\n&gt; at the table and do history flash cards at 10:30.  But I do worry that<br/>\n&gt; the youngest won&#39;t get a foundation that will support him in what he<br/>\n&gt; wants and I especially worry that my daughter won&#39;t find her passion.<br/>\n&gt; What if she&#39;s like me and she has no passion?  What if she&#39;s happy to be<br/>\n&gt; entertained but doesn&#39;t know how to entertain herself?  Goodness, I&#39;m 42<br/>\n&gt; and I don&#39;t know what I want to be when I grow up.  Egads, what a lot of<br/>\n&gt; pressure to put on a young woman!

You keep answering his questions when you can, finding him resources, helping him explore the world, and don&#39;t worry about him becomming an engineer. Really, if he&#39;s interested, he&#39;ll do all the pointing. This might help give you some ideas of how unschoolers get into college:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/teen/college\">http://sandradodd.com/teen/college</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I can&#39;t conceive<br/>\n&gt; how two or three years in high school, when he&#39;s thinking about it, will<br/>\n&gt; be enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s because schools make learning look like a long, laborious process. There&#39;s a nice essay on this next page, about half way down (Cameron) about what it looks like when an unschooler learns math from, essentially, scratch in the late teens:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whyunschool.info/?page=inaction\">http://whyunschool.info/?page=inaction</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We are going<br/>\n&gt; through a classical education curriculum now (mostly for husband&#39;s piece<br/>\n&gt; of mind, but also as a spring board for me) and she tells me she doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; like unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Keep in mind that you haven&#39;t been unschooling with her, so if you want to unschool, you&#39;ll need to start with deschooling, taking a break from anything schooly for awhile. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I suspect the bigger issue is that you don&#39;t know how to relate to her. Your young son likes things that look schooly and educational, so you haven&#39;t had to stretch your thinking at all. You&#39;ll have to stretch a bit to engage with your daughter. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo more with her. Go on day trips. Plan things if she likes plans and schedules. Go window shopping, go to fashion shows, get out and see some music or go dancing. Do fun things. Do touristy things for the heck of it. Rent a bunch of movies and watch them together. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf she likes to doodle, would she like a programming platform like Scratch that allows her to doodle and then modify them, even animate them? (its free, google it!) Or maybe she&#39;d like some design programs or design books. Don&#39;t leave it up to her to figure it out, though, engage in plans Do things with her. Try things together. And if she&#39;s happier with a schedule, do all of those things on a schedule so she can feel good about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nDrop the curriculum, though, its getting in the way of both you and her figuring out what really turns her on. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163621138,"authorName":"odiniella","from":"&quot;odiniella&quot; &lt;hgaimari@...&gt;","profile":"odiniella","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"idea and question","postDate":"1299085148","msgId":46265,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlrbHQwcys3bDRlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46266,"prevInTime":46264,"nextInTime":46266,"topicId":46265,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi.

I&#39;m brand new to this forum and kinda, almost, sorta new<br/>\nto the idea of unschooling.  I wonder if I can run my idea past you to<br/>\nsee if I&#39;m understanding this right, and to ask a question.  But I<br/>\nshould warn you, I&#39;m annoyingly long winded and frightfully boring.  I<br/>\njust thought I&#39;d put that upfront. <br/>\n<br/>\nI say kinda, almost, sorta new because I started unschooling by default.<br/>\nWell, I started homeschooling by default and that turned into<br/>\nunschooling.  I don&#39;t know that I can really take much from that<br/>\nexperience because it involves a son with Asperger&#39;s who is freakishly<br/>\nbrilliant in some ways and unfathomably defiant in others and it turned<br/>\nout that for the sake of our family&#39;s sanity, I stopped &quot;requiring&quot;<br/>\nanything from him.  Oh, and he has a frightful case of extreme anxiety<br/>\nso it&#39;s not like I just let my kids run feral (well, not always, okay,<br/>\nbut only when I can too and we&#39;re all having fun).  Eventually his<br/>\nanxiety and depression were more than we could care for at home and he&#39;s<br/>\nnow in a therapeutic boarding school and doing really well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he&#39;s an anomaly.  What he lacks in social skills and graces he makes<br/>\nup for in scientific knowledge.  Apparently he&#39;s quite the computer wiz<br/>\ntoo.  Good gravy where did he learn it all?  I know those of you who<br/>\nhaven&#39;t nodded off to sleep yet are thinking, Yep, he learned it because<br/>\nhe had the time to explore it.  And that&#39;s probably so.  But where I get<br/>\nconcerned is that <br/>\n<br/>\nA) he&#39;s not typical.  No kid gets his panties in a wad<br/>\nat age 10 because his DK book on physiology doesn&#39;t explain the Kreb&#39;s<br/>\nCycle in enough detail.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd B) he has no idea about anything other than<br/>\nscience and computers.  He doesn&#39;t care and now he&#39;s in a school where<br/>\nhe will learn basics like what a World War is and there are 7<br/>\ncontinents and the Middle East and Africa and the Americas used to be<br/>\npersonal playthings of European monarchs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have two more now and here&#39;s my idea that I wanted to run past you<br/>\nall to see if I have this right.  My youngest son came home last year. <br/>\nIt was a very stressful year for my oldest (not only were all his<br/>\nsiblings home now, but his grandfather was dying and that was very hard<br/>\nfor him to process).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe watched tv and read books and hung out at home<br/>\n(not lots of field trips because of behaviors from oldest either out in<br/>\npublic or left home alone).  It turned out that youngest son liked WWII<br/>\nstuff so we got books from the library.  Well, not so much WWII but the<br/>\ntanks and airplanes.  Okay, the tanks and airplanes were cool, but not<br/>\nnearly as cool as the stuff they made on Mythbusters!  We had a very<br/>\nMythbuster&#39;s year last year and learned from oldest where they got<br/>\nsloppy with &quot;real&quot; scientific methodology and youngest got inspired with<br/>\nmaking stuff.  After watching these kinds of shows like Mythbusters and<br/>\nJunkyard Wars and the like, and watching youtube videos, he announced to<br/>\nme the other day he knows what kind of engineer he wants to be -<br/>\nmechanical engineer.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So my idea is that I point him in that direction,<br/>\nright?  How I do that, I don&#39;t know. Until this year, I thought<br/>\n&quot;engineer&quot; and saw Dilbert in my head.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I expect that as he gets older we&#39;ll explore what colleges have good<br/>\nprograms and what their requirements are and he&#39;ll be motivated to show<br/>\nthem he is a good applicant.  Is that right?  That&#39;s my idea.  Do I have<br/>\nthat right?  What am I missing?  How do I help him get the foundation<br/>\nhe&#39;ll need to apply to college? I only ask now because I can&#39;t conceive<br/>\nhow two or three years in high school, when he&#39;s thinking about it, will<br/>\nbe enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now my question. My daughter (she&#39;s 13, 8th grade) is really frustrating me.  Oh no, not HER.  She&#39;s fabulous! <br/>\nI love her to pieces!  She&#39;s sweet and kind and thoughtful and creative.<br/>\nBut she has NO IDEA what she wants to do with her time.  We are going<br/>\nthrough a classical education curriculum now (mostly for husband&#39;s piece<br/>\nof mind, but also as a spring board for me) and she tells me she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlike unschooling.  She does NOT like having no structure or routine. <br/>\nShe likes to be organized and efficient thankyouverymuch.  But when I<br/>\nsay it&#39;s time to start language arts and here&#39;s what we&#39;ll be working on<br/>\nwith composition...she gets silly and distracting.  Or she won&#39;t come to<br/>\nthe table.  Or she won&#39;t know what to write about. In other words, she says she likes a traditional school<br/>\nexperience but her behavior tells me the opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I don&#39;t know how to help her because she doesn&#39;t know what she wants. <br/>\nShe likes to read, but she doesn&#39;t want to read all day.  She likes to<br/>\ndecorate cakes so we signed her up for a cake decorating class.  That<br/>\nwas fun, now she&#39;s done.  This week she&#39;s painting her bedroom.  Next<br/>\nweek what will she do?  She walks around the house saying &quot;What can we<br/>\ndo today? Can we go somewhere?&quot;  I don&#39;t know if she wants to go to the<br/>\nmall and hang out because that&#39;s what teens do in her books or if she<br/>\nlikes to look at the fashions or she wants to spend money (sorry babe,<br/>\nwrong mom for that). <br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;ve suggested taking clothes from the thrift<br/>\nstores and modify them but she&#39;s not interested.  She likes to draw but<br/>\nsays she&#39;s NOT an artist, she&#39;s a doodler.  Well, she&#39;s got a pretty<br/>\nsweet little style if you ask me, even if it is typical anime, she&#39;s<br/>\npicked it up well and it&#39;s lovely.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s just not focused and doesn&#39;t know what to do with her time.  She<br/>\nalso has some anxiety issues (living in the shadow of an unpredictable<br/>\nolder brother isn&#39;t for the weak) and so doesn&#39;t want to do things<br/>\nalone.  Most kids her age go into high school  so<br/>\nshe talks about going into high school because she&#39;s lonely.  Only, I<br/>\nthink the academics would eat her up and, I&#39;m afraid, be a blow to her<br/>\nself-esteem (which is just NOW starting to thrive after taking a<br/>\ncrushing from having such difficulties in school less than three years<br/>\nago).  I really like our classical education curriculum. Yeah, clearly, this is the best curriculum....for ME. <br/>\nI love it.  My kids?  meh<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I don&#39;t mind tweaking it to keep kids happy and  husband comfortable<br/>\nuntil eventually we see that the kids are learning even if we don&#39;t sit<br/>\nat the table and do history flash cards at 10:30.  But I do worry that<br/>\nthe youngest won&#39;t get a foundation that will support him in what he<br/>\nwants and I especially worry that my daughter won&#39;t find her passion.<br/>\nWhat if she&#39;s like me and she has no passion?  What if she&#39;s happy to be<br/>\nentertained but doesn&#39;t know how to entertain herself?  Goodness, I&#39;m 42<br/>\nand I don&#39;t know what I want to be when I grow up.  Egads, what a lot of<br/>\npressure to put on a young woman!  So, um, if you&#39;ve gotten this<br/>\nfar...help?<br/>\nHelen, exhausted<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46306,"nextTopicId":46354}}
