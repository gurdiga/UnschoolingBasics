I can t tell you how helpful they can be in actually SEEING it live, in action---and for convincing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2005080658\">Joyce and I have both mentioned conferences recently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell you how helpful they can be in actually SEEING it live, in action---and for convincing spouses.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago when I started the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference, it was the &quot;only game in town.&quot; People came from all over the country, Canada, Europe, Mexico, and Australia. Now, there&#39;s something almost ever six weeks or so. Either full-blown conferences, gatherings, Non-Cons (non-conferences), or parties. No joke! Something every month.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLast weekend, my family went to GA to visit friends. We&#39;re in TN for ARGH! next weekend. We go to Atlanta again (for Mannheim Steamroller) in Nov. Everyone&#39;s invited to SC (my house---Danny Schmidt house concert) in Dec. We&#39;re celebrating again at my house in SC in Jan ---Cameron&#39;s 21 birthday party!. Hundreds of families will be in OH at the Waterpark Gathering in Feb. And that&#39;s all BEFORE the conference &quot;seasons&quot; in the spring and fall. Oh---and my family is missing a Non-Con in the NW next weekend as well as the Costa Rica conference in Dec.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s still room in Costa Rica. Contact Sharon at Pura Vida. There&#39;s still a cabin available at ARGH! in TN Nov 2-4. Ask Ren. Anyone&#39;s invited to my house for the Danny House Concert Dec 20. And we&#39;d LOVE a houseful for Cameron&#39;s birthday Jan 23-25. PLENTY of rooms left at the Waterpark Gathering Feb 2-7---contact Carol or Kimberly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nComing up we have:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nARGH! in TN<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Pura Vida Conference in Costa Rica<br/>\n<br/>\nThe WaterPark Gathering in Ohio<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Great Big Happy Life Conference in NJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Toronto Joyful Living Conference, Canada<br/>\n<br/>\nThe LIFE is Good Conference in WA state<br/>\n<br/>\nThe SHINE Gathering in Niagara Falls, Canada<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Good Vibrations Conference in San Diego, CA<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NE Unschooling Conference near Boston, MA<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Alphabet Soup Conference in Alberta, Canada<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Myrtle Beach Gathering in SC<br/>\n<br/>\nand the Unschooling Adventure Cruise and Conference<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI could be missing one or two. If you know of others I&#39;ve missed or forgotten, please add them!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are all spin-offs of Live and Learn or of each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, Arizona, California, and Illinois also have *very* unschooly-friendly homeschooling conferences. NC has their FLT gatherings. Non-Cons are springing up all over the place. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are so many opportunities to meet unschoolers now---there&#39;s really no excuse NOT to!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36772,"nextTopicId":36806}}
