I don&#39;t really watch TV too <br/>\noften and when I do, it&#39;s hardly ever on Oprah any more. I remember watching <br/>\nyrs ago when the LA riots had gone on, one man stood up and made a comment <br/>\nabout how the riots were like a dejavu (I know I misspelled that one) sort of <br/>\nthing and her response was something like, (not sure exactly quote by quote it was <br/>\nso long ago)! Yes, history does have a way of repeating itself, the tables <br/>\nare just turning around now!, she said it in a tone that sounded almost as if <br/>\nshe was maybe just a bit, pleased. That really made me question her motives from <br/>\nthat day on. Maybe she was just upset (it was an awfully upsetting topic) and <br/>\nnot thinking clearly about what she was saying at the time, I don&#39;t know, but <br/>\nit really bothered me. We have a mixed family, and there is a lot of love <br/>\nbetween us all. One time, one of my husbands cousins was about 19 and in college, <br/>\nshe started becoming more and more angry (she is half black, half white) she <br/>\nsaid &quot;My Dad is just too white&quot; etc. She was becoming more and more angry with <br/>\nlife and even other family members. My husband told her that it was good to <br/>\nstand up for your beliefs and fight for what is right and that he/we admired <br/>\nher for that, but when you become what you are fighting against, then you are <br/>\nloosing the battle. <br/>\n<br/>\n*****It&#39;s like she&#39;s saying &quot;Hey, look at me.  Look at all the good things <br/>\nI&#39;m doing.&quot;***<br/>\nI find myself becoming more and more disgusted by Hollywood folks who come <br/>\nout and shine like that myself. (or if I have to hear their political <br/>\nviews.....does acting make you an expert on politics? Even if I happen to agree with <br/>\nthem at the time, they still drive me nuts!) When 9/11 took place (and other <br/>\natrocities too!) I got so tired of &quot;hearing&quot; about this &quot;certain&quot; person donating <br/>\nsuch and such amount of cash, it was nice of them, but was it necessary to <br/>\nhear about &quot;them&quot; doing all over the news? No, I don&#39;t thinks so. Wouldn&#39;t it <br/>\nhave been cool to hear &quot;An anonymous person donated such and such to help with <br/>\nthe 9/11 atrocities, they said no name was necessary&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts, I guess I&#39;m sort of sick of Hollywood these days.<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9740,"nextTopicId":9781}}
