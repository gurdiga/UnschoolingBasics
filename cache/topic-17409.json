In my work with adults who bring up their concerns as parents, I try not to get involved in discussions about issues they don&#39;t see as a problem. This is unless I consider some subject they not considering as absolutely central and crucial. <br/>\nI would suggest you ask yourself, whether you are bringing the homeschooling up as a topic for the psychiatrist to comment on. If that is so, you should reconsider. This psychiatrist is obviously not the person to help you in your journey as an unschooler. You will never get her approval or even helpful feedback about this. <br/>\nPsychiatrists are just people with their own limitations and biases. Many psychiatrists are only trained to provide medication and diagnoses and have no ability to conduct therapy. You should let her know that you do not need help about your decision to homeschool and are not interested in discussing this issue. If the psychiatrist accepts these terms, then you can move onto and talk with her about whatever other concerns that motivates to to bring your daughter for treatment. You can confine your discussion to those topics, even if it is just about medication. Stick with what you want from the psychiatrist. <br/>\nIf the psychiatrist can&#39;t let go of homeschooling as an issue, even if you are clear that you do not want to discuss this, than you need to find someone else who will be clearer about their role and respect your boundaries and decisions more. <br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nAndrea   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279640369,"authorName":"kristina pickens","from":"kristina pickens &lt;jories_mom2000@...&gt;","profile":"jories_mom2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Homeschooling an only child","postDate":"1158689152","msgId":17439,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwOTE5MTgwNTUyLjExMDg1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjU1NTA2Lm1haWwucmU0LnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA5MTkxMDM1czMyY2M1NDE5eDE1OTI1NjZmYzZhN2U5MTlAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17432,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":17438,"nextInTime":17440,"topicId":17409,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"AMEN.

I think you&#39;ll find that most are not exclusive to school  and <br/>\neasily accomplished through other activities.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf she is having trouble making friends at school and she wants help to  make <br/>\nfriends, this would be more naturally done within the scope of her  <br/>\ninterests.  It would be safer emotionally in a small group.<br/>\n <br/>\nI also have never quite understood why being in a room full of thirty  people <br/>\nyour age equals socialization.  Adults are required to &quot;socialize&quot;  with a <br/>\nvery wide range of people: older, younger, smarter, not very intelligent,  <br/>\nprofessional, laborer.....those people aren&#39;t necessarily your friends but  people <br/>\nyou work with, for and get services from.  A child, even an only  child, will <br/>\naccompany the parent in the real world of social/professional  interactions.   <br/>\nTheir model for interaction isn&#39;t a room full of other  kids, but adults <br/>\ndoing adult things!<br/>\n <br/>\nIn addition, does she *want* friends her age?  There is nothing wrong  with <br/>\nwanting to be around older/younger people.  I think my grandmother was  my best <br/>\nfriend when I was having a difficult time with my school peers.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere is so much to say here!  But I will stop.
