At the time they<br/>\n&gt; were 5, 8 & 11. <br/>\n&gt; They&#39;re now 8, 11 & 14 and have been unschooled for<br/>\n&gt; over 2 years. My <br/>\n&gt; older two suffered severe abuse and extreme neglect<br/>\n&gt; while still in <br/>\n&gt; their birth home and emotional trauma in foster<br/>\n&gt; care. They both came <br/>\n&gt; to us very angry and hostile children but over time<br/>\n&gt; (and with a lot <br/>\n&gt; of help) my middle child has overcome a lot of the<br/>\n&gt; obstacles that <br/>\n&gt; stood in her way of having a happy life. My oldest<br/>\n&gt; has not and <br/>\n&gt; instead has continued on his downward spiral. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The last few months have been filled with violence,<br/>\n&gt; anger and <br/>\n&gt; aggression...mainly towards me. I was prepared for<br/>\n&gt; this early in our <br/>\n&gt; adoption....having talked extensively with his<br/>\n&gt; caseworkers and <br/>\n&gt; therapists about how *in his mind*, the love from a<br/>\n&gt; mother equals <br/>\n&gt; pain and abuse and he will do all he can to push me<br/>\n&gt; away to protect <br/>\n&gt; himself from my &quot;love&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He has started getting physical wth me in the last 3<br/>\n&gt; months. (My <br/>\n&gt; son, at 14 years old is  6&#39;1&quot; and I&#39;m 4&#39; 11&quot;). I<br/>\n&gt; have had to call <br/>\n&gt; the cops and he has been arrested twice, once for<br/>\n&gt; assualt and <br/>\n&gt; battery and another time for assualt with a deadly<br/>\n&gt; weapon. I <br/>\n&gt; understand where his anger stems from and I also<br/>\n&gt; know that it has <br/>\n&gt; nothing to do with me but I get punished by him<br/>\n&gt; every day for things <br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t do. He takes all his anger out on<br/>\n&gt; me...anger that should be <br/>\n&gt; directed at other people...the people that caused<br/>\n&gt; him great pain and <br/>\n&gt; suffering. I&#39;m tired of being his emotional punching<br/>\n&gt; bag. It&#39;s so <br/>\n&gt; very sad because he cannot accept us, or our love.<br/>\n&gt; His attachment <br/>\n&gt; therapist (Cimion has reactive attachment disorder)<br/>\n&gt; made the comment <br/>\n&gt; that we adopted him as our son, but he has failed to<br/>\n&gt; adopt us, as <br/>\n&gt; his parents. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He is currently on probation from his last arrest<br/>\n&gt; but has since <br/>\n&gt; violated the conditions and may be facing another<br/>\n&gt; arrest. I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; know what the near future will hold for him. Having<br/>\n&gt; him live at home <br/>\n&gt; is becoming a nightmare and he may have to be placed<br/>\n&gt; in a <br/>\n&gt; residential facility, at least temporary while he<br/>\n&gt; gets some help. At <br/>\n&gt; this point, my head is spinning and I&#39;m trying to<br/>\n&gt; keep some of my <br/>\n&gt; sanity for my other two children.    <br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt; Also, let me be very clear that this has nothing to<br/>\n&gt; do with <br/>\n&gt; unschooling. Unschooling is not the reason for this.<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling <br/>\n&gt; (more specifically radical unschooling) has being a<br/>\n&gt; major force in <br/>\n&gt; the healing journey for my younger two. Cimion has<br/>\n&gt; been like this <br/>\n&gt; long before unschooling, long before I even met him.<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s ironic that I&#39;m posting this today. It&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; 4th anniversary of <br/>\n&gt; the day that my husband & I met our children for the<br/>\n&gt; first time.    <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Through this all, my mother is in the hospital.<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re very close, as <br/>\n&gt; a matter of fact it was her idea to move from New<br/>\n&gt; York City to <br/>\n&gt; Florida and we followed her.
