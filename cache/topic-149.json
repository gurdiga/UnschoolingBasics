If you&#39;ve laid the ground work already this should be <br/>\nrather easy.

Fortunately, Adrian just <br/>\nloves to be read to.  I do have to watch what I read, though.  He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like me to read anything to him that he can tell was <br/>\nspecifically written for an adult.  We are currently on book number <br/>\nseven in A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS.  He just loves those books.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And if you feel doubts creeping in, come here and we&#39;ll talk ya <br/>\ndown. and if the desire to test/quiz your son creeps in, I sugest <br/>\nrunn to ivillage.com and taking as many of their online quizes as YOU <br/>\ncan, untill the desire passes, if you make it through all of them, <br/>\nwith out realizing how pointless quizes are...go to google and type <br/>\nin online quizes you&#39;ll be busy for months :)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have that whole useless testing thing down.

Adrian&#39;s <br/>\nofficially been home for a year and a half, and we have been <br/>\nunschooling for about six months.  We are quite a ways through the <br/>\ndeschooling phase.
