But I&#39;ve stopped looking at it like that,  <br/>\nI am just really passionate and my emotions need BIG EFFECTIVE words  <br/>\nto feel right to me. And I look at my kids the exact same way. They  <br/>\nsee that I have places I don&#39;t use it (so much) and places where it  <br/>\nis more okay, and I think they follow along for the most part. My  <br/>\noldest is very uncomfortable with using ANY  word with emotion, so  <br/>\nhe&#39;ll tell me so if I let out a big loud cuss word. My husband was  <br/>\nalso raised in a household where no cussing was allowed, and he&#39;s  <br/>\nreally uncomfortable with it. We&#39;ve worked really hard for him to  <br/>\nrealize that the kids are their own people, and that he can&#39;t choose  <br/>\nfor them.  He does model more socially acceptable communication, but  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get on to them anymore unless we are at weddings or funerals.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite story is a few months ago at Target, Dan was really  <br/>\nupset. And he turned to me and said very loudly (as only a four year  <br/>\nold can, i think) &quot;MOM! That really PISSES ME OFF!&quot; Dead silence from  <br/>\naround us, everyone staring to see what my reaction would be  <br/>\n(obviously I would beat him, yes?) Looks of shock when all I said was  <br/>\n&quot;I can tell you&#39;re really angry, really really really angry! What can  <br/>\nwe do?&quot; bwahahaha. (For the record, he wanted toy that was over $100  <br/>\nright before payday...can you say cashless? His solution was to pick  <br/>\nout a $1 toy and then write me a letter reminding me to buy it when  <br/>\nwe had enough money. Not bad, eh?)<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly, thanks for the story about the nephew. We had a similar issue  <br/>\nat our in-laws house last time we visited. Josh got killed off in a  <br/>\nboss stage, really after a lot of work without saving, and he said  <br/>\nquickly and savagely under his breath &quot;damn!&quot; Boy, there was tattling  <br/>\nall over the place as every one of our nephews and nieces went to  <br/>\ntheir particular parent to tell on him. Everyone looked at me and all  <br/>\ni could think was how each one of those hypocritical adults had  <br/>\nprobably cussed at least twice since the family gathering began! I  <br/>\nshrugged and said something like he&#39;s probably pretty upset, at least  <br/>\nit&#39;s not road rage.<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (12), Breanna (10), Emily (8), Rachel (7), Sam (6), Dan  <br/>\n(4), and Avari Rose (19 months)<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 19, 2007, at 9:30 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pattywithawhy@...\">pattywithawhy@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I&#39;m curious what other swear-ers out there do, and what &quot;results&quot;<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; getting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I swear like a sailor and have been known as a potty mouth.
