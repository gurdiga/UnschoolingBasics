Uh huh. But I&#39;d rather that he be<br/>\n  comfortable talking about it and using it responsibly than sneaking around<br/>\nand<br/>\n  hiding it because I&#39;d forbidden it.<br/>\n<br/>\n When I was bout 15 my mom found out that I was smoking pot, instead of yelling and screaming at me, we started talking about it. She shared her fears about me smoking(she also smoked it, I found out). She was afraid of me and my friends driving while stoned (we were) buying frome people we didn&#39;t know (we were) having it on us while out and smoking in public (we were). She was willing to provide me and my friends a safe environment, if we could behave responsably and not do the things that were causing her to worry and be scared. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was great, I did what I needed to do with pot, and because of the repect my mom gave me and those &quot;parental reprocussions&quot; were gone. It was over with and out of my system in a much shorter period of thime than if it had been a power struggle. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunatly, my dad was not as open with me and my time living with him led me down a much darker path that took a while to recover from. <br/>\n<br/>\nJason and I both feel that if and when our kids decide that they are ready to try experimenting we would rather do as my mom did and provide a safe space for them. We look at it as all other &quot;learning experiences&quot; it&#39;s better with a safty net; of love, trust and respect. I would rather thaem be in my home where I can help with any problems that may arise, than them in a back alley or in a strangers car where no help may be avalible to them if they should need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may not have said this to clearly, it&#39;s been a rough day, and I&#39;m trying to catch a few mins here and there in between meltdowns and crisises<br/>\n<br/>\n~Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.

I&#39;m not going to give  any<br/>\n  more examples because what I&#39;m really looking for is what YOU would<br/>\n  do if it was something that YOU felt this way about, not just<br/>\n  solutions to MY examples.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Wendy,<br/>\n<br/>\n  We don&#39;t tend to work with hypotheticals here. Real life examples are<br/>\nbest.<br/>\n  Stating a problem you&#39;re dealing with and asking how we&#39;ve dealt with a<br/>\n  similar  situation gives us a place to jump off from.<br/>\n<br/>\n  BUT----in this instance, I actually have an example I can share.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Many people would think of alcohol/marijuana use as &quot;disruptive,<br/>\n  destructive, or dangerous&quot;. I have a sixteen year old son and am in the<br/>\nmidst of  this.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As a teen/young adult. I spent a lot of time drinking---and fairly<br/>\n  irresponsibly. But shooting up, snorting something up my nose, popping<br/>\npills, or<br/>\n  smoking anything was *never* attractive to me. But I have a son  who likes<br/>\npot.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My options:<br/>\n  1) I could yell and scream and forbid weed in *my* house.<br/>\n<br/>\n  2) I could ignore the whole thing----pretend it&#39;s not happening.<br/>\n<br/>\n  3) I could turn him in to the cops.<br/>\n<br/>\n  4) I could support his &quot;habit&quot;----make it out to be peachy-keen and even<br/>\nbuy<br/>\n  it for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n  5) I could probably do several other things-----but what I&#39;ve chosen to do<br/>\n  is to tell him how I feel about it. Ask him to make wise choices about its<br/>\n  purchase and use. Asked him not to smoke in the house or in a car----OR<br/>\nanywhere<br/>\n  he might get caught. To please keep it away from his brother. And it IS<br/>\n  illegal----he could go to jail for posession.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He has friends who are &quot;pot-heads&quot;----who will smoke whatever they can get<br/>\n  their paws on, and stay high most of the time. Their parents have banned<br/>\npot<br/>\n  and  refuse to talk about it except for the command, &quot;Don&#39;t smoke pot.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  So.....Cameron smokes. Not in the house, but in the garage. He doesn&#39;t<br/>\ndrive<br/>\n  when or after smoking. He doesn&#39;t allow his friends to drive after smoking<br/>\n  either (They&#39;ll go get their &quot;munchies&quot; *before* they get high.).<br/>\n<br/>\n  He&#39;s responsible with it. Buys &quot;organic&quot; from people he trusts. Keeps it<br/>\n  away from his little brother (and me! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\n  He attends NORML meetings (although I&#39;ve suggested NOT to sign anything<br/>\n  there! &lt;g&gt;) and thinks it should be legalized (in fact, he&#39;s read----and<br/>\npicked<br/>\n  apart--- the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and several laws to  find<br/>\nout<br/>\n  more about it).<br/>\n<br/>\n  He&#39;s agreeable to taxing it, if it were made legal.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He knows all about the history of hemp and marijuana and the  reasons it<br/>\nwas<br/>\n  banned/made illegal----big business of the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s and the<br/>\ninvention of<br/>\n  polyesters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;ve talked about it a great deal. I give him my views----and he does<br/>\nsome<br/>\n  research and often opens my eyes to new thinking. I&#39;m still not wild about<br/>\nit,<br/>\n  but I feel he&#39;s using it responsibly (ugh!)----and will not abuse it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do I wish he wouldn&#39;t use it at all? Uh huh. But I&#39;d rather that he be<br/>\n  comfortable talking about it and using it responsibly than sneaking around<br/>\nand<br/>\n  hiding it because I&#39;d forbidden it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Issues like this are waaaay harder to handle than drawing on the dining<br/>\nroom<br/>\n  table! &lt;g&gt; But if a child has always felt listened to and respected  and<br/>\n  trusted, he&#39;s more likely to share his concerns with you----even illegal<br/>\n  ones!---and let you be a part of his life, even as a teen/young adult!<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I was not  listing things that I <br/>\nspecifically wanted help with...I just wanted to  know what some of <br/>\nyou might do with something you DO have a problem with,  KWIM?  Surely <br/>\nthere are some things...I understand the concept of  giving them a <br/>\nworld of choices and focusing on things they CAN do...lot of  freedom <br/>\nin my house....but surely there are some that are not OK because  they <br/>\nare dangerous, destructive or disruptive.  I&#39;m not going to give  any <br/>\nmore examples because what I&#39;m really looking for is what YOU would  <br/>\ndo if it was something that YOU felt this way about, not just  <br/>\nsolutions to MY examples. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nWendy,<br/>\n <br/>\nWe don&#39;t tend to work with hypotheticals here. Real life examples are best.  <br/>\nStating a problem you&#39;re dealing with and asking how we&#39;ve dealt with a <br/>\nsimilar  situation gives us a place to jump off from.<br/>\n <br/>\nBUT----in this instance, I actually have an example I can share.<br/>\n <br/>\nMany people would think of alcohol/marijuana use as &quot;disruptive,  <br/>\ndestructive, or dangerous&quot;. I have a sixteen year old son and am in the midst of  this.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs a teen/young adult. I spent a lot of time drinking---and fairly  <br/>\nirresponsibly. But shooting up, snorting something up my nose, popping  pills, or <br/>\nsmoking anything was *never* attractive to me. But I have a son  who likes pot.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy options: <br/>\n1) I could yell and scream and forbid weed in *my* house. <br/>\n <br/>\n2) I could ignore the whole thing----pretend it&#39;s not happening.<br/>\n <br/>\n3) I could turn him in to the cops.<br/>\n <br/>\n4) I could support his &quot;habit&quot;----make it out to be peachy-keen and even  buy <br/>\nit for him.<br/>\n <br/>\n5) I could probably do several other things-----but what I&#39;ve chosen to do  <br/>\nis to tell him how I feel about it. Ask him to make wise choices about its  <br/>\npurchase and use. Asked him not to smoke in the house or in a car----OR  anywhere <br/>\nhe might get caught. To please keep it away from his brother. And it IS  <br/>\nillegal----he could go to jail for posession.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe has friends who are &quot;pot-heads&quot;----who will smoke whatever they can get  <br/>\ntheir paws on, and stay high most of the time. Their parents have banned pot <br/>\nand  refuse to talk about it except for the command, &quot;Don&#39;t smoke pot.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nSo.....Cameron smokes. Not in the house, but in the garage. He doesn&#39;t  drive <br/>\nwhen or after smoking. He doesn&#39;t allow his friends to drive after smoking  <br/>\neither (They&#39;ll go get their &quot;munchies&quot; *before* they get high.).<br/>\n <br/>\nHe&#39;s responsible with it. Buys &quot;organic&quot; from people he trusts. Keeps it  <br/>\naway from his little brother (and me! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n <br/>\nHe attends NORML meetings (although I&#39;ve suggested NOT to sign anything  <br/>\nthere! &lt;g&gt;) and thinks it should be legalized (in fact, he&#39;s read----and  picked <br/>\napart--- the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and several laws to  find out <br/>\nmore about it). <br/>\n <br/>\nHe&#39;s agreeable to taxing it, if it were made legal.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe knows all about the history of hemp and marijuana and the  reasons it was <br/>\nbanned/made illegal----big business of the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s and the  invention of <br/>\npolyesters.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;ve talked about it a great deal. I give him my views----and he does some  <br/>\nresearch and often opens my eyes to new thinking. I&#39;m still not wild about it, <br/>\n but I feel he&#39;s using it responsibly (ugh!)----and will not abuse it.<br/>\n <br/>\nDo I wish he wouldn&#39;t use it at all? Uh huh. But I&#39;d rather that he be  <br/>\ncomfortable talking about it and using it responsibly than sneaking around and  <br/>\nhiding it because I&#39;d forbidden it.<br/>\n <br/>\nIssues like this are waaaay harder to handle than drawing on the dining  room <br/>\ntable! &lt;g&gt; But if a child has always felt listened to and respected  and <br/>\ntrusted, he&#39;s more likely to share his concerns with you----even illegal  <br/>\nones!---and let you be a part of his life, even as a teen/young adult!<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":700,"nextTopicId":593}}
