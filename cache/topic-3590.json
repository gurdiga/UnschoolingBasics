People learn.  They&#39;re learning all the time.

But I&#39;m not interested in what<br/>\n&quot;works&quot; in regards to education.  I&#39;m interested in my son having the<br/>\nopportunity to live the life he loves.  I&#39;m interested in him trusting<br/>\nhis own decisions and trusting his ability.   My son is not in pursuit of<br/>\nan educational enterprise, he&#39;s living life.  He&#39;s learning all the time,<br/>\nbut not because he has been made to believe he must get educated.  He&#39;s<br/>\nlearning because it would be impossible for him to not learn.   When he<br/>\nneeded to talk he talked.  When he needed to walk he walked.  When he<br/>\nneeded to read he read.  I have witnessed twelve years of constant<br/>\nlearning and have no doubt he can and will learn whatever he decides he<br/>\nneeds.   I&#39;m available to provide him with resources, support, ideas,<br/>\nassistance, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very possible he doesn&#39;t know at this moment that when he&#39;s twenty<br/>\nfive he will want to know how to put a new engine in his Jeep . <br/>\nBut by that time he will have had twenty five years of learning<br/>\nexperience, of understanding he is capable of learning anything he wants<br/>\nto learn and he will learn how to put a new engine in his Jeep.

I know from discussions<br/>\nof the portfolio she turned in (Ohio requirement) that her children&#39;s<br/>\nexposure to math for the year was limited to the measurements involved<br/>\nin building a deck. Wow.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you see the portfolio? Did she include every minute of the year in the<br/>\nportfolio? How fancy was the deck? Do they till, sow, fertilize and reap on<br/>\nher farm? Is it a commercial concern with produce being sold? Do they pay<br/>\ntaxes? Buy groceries and animal feed? Pay bills? Have cel phones with<br/>\nnumbers of minutes? Are they on the electricity grid or do they make their<br/>\nown power? Do they collect eggs from their own chickens? Are they on line?<br/>\nDO THEY MAKE COOKIES?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou seem to be missing the point of life experience based learning, which is<br/>\nthat everything is a learning situation. Unfortunately some States force<br/>\nUnschoolers to have to contrive &quot;educationese&quot; out of their daily living.<br/>\nOften the recommendation is only to record the minimum required, rather than<br/>\ngive the States the opportunity to increase regulations. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; So I disagree<br/>\nwith those who would have the educational enterprise be entirely<br/>\nchild-directed. Child driven, sure, but parent guided is what works<br/>\nfor use.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have already said that people don&#39;t consider you an unschooling family.<br/>\nThe people who are Unschooling here, and on the sister lists, are engaging<br/>\nin a child directed educational lifestyle with great success. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I was walking down the street and I fell into a hole<br/>\nSome people came and saw me and they helped me get out of that hole.<br/>\nA few days later I was walking down the street<br/>\nI fell into that hole again and again someone helped me get out<br/>\nAnd then I was walking down the street and I fell in the hole again<br/>\nI could not believe I fell in that hole again<br/>\nWhen I looked at the walls of the hole I saw how to get out<br/>\nWhen I got out of the hole, I saw some people<br/>\nI warned them about the hole<br/>\nThe next day I walked down a different street.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHUH??<br/>\nSo you are quoting some story about some individual who is too stupid to<br/>\nstay out of the same hole days in a row, and it is relevant how? I don&#39;t see<br/>\nthe analogy. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;This quote may not quite apply to this particular situation as I don&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve that I have been in this hole myself, but I like this<br/>\nquotation, and that is what I am doing -- pointing out a hazard.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo you are not pointing out a hazard. You have simply been saying, in<br/>\nincreasingly barbed and offensive ways, that we must be neglecting our<br/>\nchildren&#39;s educations, and now that we are too stupid to stay out of an<br/>\nimaginary hole.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t want to Unschool then don&#39;t. I&#39;m sure you and your kids are<br/>\nleading a perfectly happy life. However this is a list for people who DO<br/>\nwant to learn about Unschooling. The &quot;hazard&quot; you are talking about, and I&#39;m<br/>\nstill not clear on what that is, is not real in the experience of people who<br/>\nare Unschooling. Some of the long time Unschoolers freely giving up their<br/>\ntime and energy here have been doing it for over 20 years. Their children<br/>\nare grown and almost grown. If you can&#39;t learn something about Unschooling<br/>\nfrom the people here, you can at least refrain from telling us how little<br/>\nrespect you have for us. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

As far as I know the people I am thinking of do not<br/>\nsubscribe to this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here is the heart of the problem for me. When a discussion arose<br/>\nof why (in a certain person&#39;s opinion) so many blacks were lazy and<br/>\npreferred to go on welfare rather than get a job, she would not even<br/>\nlook at statistics that said otherwise. Because she was a radical<br/>\nunschooler, and I guess that in her worldview statistics were<br/>\nschoolish stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis person lives on an isolated farm in Ohio. I know from discussions<br/>\nof the portfolio she turned in (Ohio requirement) that her children&#39;s<br/>\nexposure to math for the year was limited to the measurements involved<br/>\nin building a deck. Wow.<br/>\n<br/>\nPardon me if I find this a bit light for teenagers. Frankly, I think<br/>\nthose children are being ill-served. Yeah, they could be equally<br/>\nill-served in a public school. Yeah yeah yeah, this is schoolish<br/>\nconcern for the level where they should be, sure. But if and when<br/>\nthose children become interested in academic pursuits they will have<br/>\nseveral years of work to do if they want to major in anything but<br/>\nEnglish. Why limit their possibilities?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a flaw of unschooling per se, but of how certain people<br/>\nuse it. I do think that their are things you should learn whose<br/>\nusefulness is not immediately apparent. Like algebra. So I disagree<br/>\nwith those who would have the educational enterprise be entirely<br/>\nchild-directed. Child driven, sure, but parent guided is what works<br/>\nfor use.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am saying is directed to the woman who asked for opinions, and<br/>\nall I am saying is -- there is a hole there. For those who are<br/>\nunfamiliar with the quotation, it goes something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nI was walking down the street and I fell into a hole<br/>\nSome people came and saw me and they helped me get out of that hole.<br/>\nA few days later I was walking down the street<br/>\nI fell into that hole again and again someone helped me get out<br/>\nAnd then<br/>\nI was walking down the street and I fell in the hole again<br/>\nI could not believe I fell in that hole again<br/>\nWhen I looked at the walls of the hole I saw how to get out<br/>\nWhen I got out of the hole, I saw some people<br/>\nI warned them about the hole<br/>\nThe next day I walked down a different street.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis quote may not quite apply to this particular situation as I don&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve that I have been in this hole myself, but I like this<br/>\nquotation, and that is what I am doing -- pointing out a hazard. There<br/>\nis no reason to let fear of this hazard rule our lives or keep us from<br/>\nteaching our children as we see fit. But if the hazard seems like a<br/>\ndanger into which we might fall...perhaps we should take heed and um,<br/>\nmaybe bring a ladder or a rope.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam, if you&#39;d like to nitpick over typos or tell me that I am not<br/>\ndoing this properly, please feel free.

I loved college, personally. So I think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is important to allow the child to chose, rather than specifically<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discouraging academic or non-academic pursuits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the important thing is what a child wants to do in life.  I have met several artists who went to college to get a &quot;degree&quot; and said that it was 4 wasted years in their lives.  They learned squat that they didn&#39;t already know or they felt hindered by artistic limitations.  I went to college for 5 years to study theatre arts and vocal music.  I hated every subject except my theatre, music and psychology classes.  Of course I also hated how those other subjects were taught (memorizations of long lists of historical dates or respewing literature professor&#39;s own words back to him with no room for free-thought).  My own xh is a professional without ever having stepped foot inside an institute of &quot;higher learning.&quot;  He is one of the smartest people I know.  All self-taught.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now having said that, I think it is important for children to have realistic expectations.  They can&#39;t be a doctor (in today&#39;s society) without going to college and medical school (and serving an internship).  They will have a hard time becoming a librarian without an MLS.  Higher learning is probably needed for someone who wants to go into some science field.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would love to see colleges or &quot;institutes of higher learning&quot; that catered to individuals rather than masses.  For instance colleges of music that teach music to musicians rather than history, science, math, literature, and physical education.  Colleges that teach dance to dancers.  Universities of science to scientists.  etc.  And many of these fields could be combined.  We just need to rethink how we teach.  I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to saying, &quot;You need X number of field related credits and 3-5 classes outside your field.&quot;  But not say, &quot;Oh you have to have 9 credits of history and 12 of literature and 6 of foreign language and 6 of psychology and mathematics at least up through calculus (I have never had to figure out the co-sine of anything since college!) and 12 in science to be a theatre major who wants to specialize in singing, acting and dancing.  Blech!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It troubles me somewhat when I see people proudly proclaiming<br/>\n&gt; &gt; themselves to be radical unschoolers in posts full of misspellings and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sentence fragments. Fortunately these are a minority of unschooling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parents, and I tell myself that just as childen survive bab schools<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their children will survive their unschooling parents.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m probably guilty of this some as I type at 70+ wpm and don&#39;t use a spell check.  I string words and phrases together when I e-mail and have had deliciously long run on sentences.  My fingers can hardly keep up with my brain.  I&#39;ve even been to leave a few words out ;-)  LOL!!  And you never know that the person who has the poorest grammar skills won&#39;t be the one that can program circles around you or plays in an orchestra as first chair violin!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I personally do think that childen, when left to themselves, often<br/>\n&gt; &gt; choose pursuits that would confound the skeptics. I personally do feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the need to intervene every so often and assign a specific book that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know they can read though it might be a bit hard to start -- Kim by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rudyard Kipling was the last one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh yes; and I always skip the prologue of The Scarlet Letter LOL!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Our particular sticking point is math, where they are falling somewhat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; behind.  I do think an appreciation of algebra and calculus is a good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thing,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How do you feel that they are &quot;behind&quot;  Behind still recognizes public or traditional schooling as the standard.  Your children are probably right where they need to be for comprehension.  My kids understand concepts of mathematics better than some of their schooled counterparts.  And although it is one of my own fearful spots (what if my children don&#39;t get math!) I&#39;ve tried to not get anxious because even my 6yo understand multiplication even if he doesn&#39;t know what multiplication is or what the &quot;tables&quot; are.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and it is one of those things like brushing your teeth where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the benefit is not immediately apparent.  Actually, if anyone has a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; suggestion on *that* (besides don&#39;t worry about it cause they wll when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they are ready) then I might like to hear it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, teeth-brushing isn&#39;t an option in our house.  I have no guarantees that my kids got my xh&#39;s teeth rather than my teeth.  My xh is 39 and has never had a cavity in his life!  Doesn&#39;t even get plaque!  I&#39;m 40 and currently am missing 3 teeth that I am in the process of having fixed.  Not from lack of brushing.  I have wonderful dental hygeine.  I have horrible dental genes.  I have gorgeous gums (according to my dentist).  My teeth are just brittle and break easily.  I actually have better teeth than my mom and my grandmother had full dentures by the time she was my age!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps I should describe myself as a mixed or eclectic unschooler,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but I have been around the mulberry bush with the politically correct<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on the various lists that I am not much interested in the labels<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anymore.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Labels are for people who are insecure with who they are (Can&#39;t remember who said that)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; To answer your husband&#39;s concern about college; my own difficulties<br/>\n&gt; &gt; along this line are that they tell me that my 14yo is too young and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they won&#39;t even consider him until he&#39;s 16. Otherwise I&#39;d say he&#39;s as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ready as your average community college freshman, math problems and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Which doesn&#39;t say much for your average community college freshman&#39;s previous educational experience.  :-)  Think how much more ready your son will be in 2 more years.  And in 2 years he may even have an idea of what he wants to focus on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a friend who has had 6 kids.  3 homeschooled and 3 that went to school at various times in their lives.  Not one child went directly from &quot;high school&quot; to college.  They all took a few years and went an experienced the world.  One kid did missionary work and today is in her last year of seminary to become a UU minister.  Another took odd jobs and opened her own health food store (which is doing well) and is a midwife apprentice.  Another spent 2 years doing odd jobs and saved every penny he had and went touring Europe.

I loved college, personally. So I think<br/>\n&gt; it is important to allow the child to chose, rather than specifically<br/>\n&gt; discouraging academic or non-academic pursuits.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the important thing is what a child wants to do in life.  I have met several artists who went to college to get a &quot;degree&quot; and said that it was 4 wasted years in their lives.  They learned squat that they didn&#39;t already know or they felt hindered by artistic limitations.  I went to college for 5 years to study theatre arts and vocal music.  I hated every subject except my theatre, music and psychology classes.  Of course I also hated how those other subjects were taught (memorizations of long lists of historical dates or respewing literature professor&#39;s own words back to him with no room for free-thought).  My own xh is a professional without ever having stepped foot inside an institute of &quot;higher learning.&quot;  He is one of the smartest people I know.  All self-taught.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow having said that, I think it is important for children to have realistic expectations.  They can&#39;t be a doctor (in today&#39;s society) without going to college and medical school (and serving an internship).  They will have a hard time becoming a librarian without an MLS.  Higher learning is probably needed for someone who wants to go into some science field.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to see colleges or &quot;institutes of higher learning&quot; that catered to individuals rather than masses.  For instance colleges of music that teach music to musicians rather than history, science, math, literature, and physical education.  Colleges that teach dance to dancers.  Universities of science to scientists.  etc.  And many of these fields could be combined.  We just need to rethink how we teach.  I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to saying, &quot;You need X number of field related credits and 3-5 classes outside your field.&quot;  But not say, &quot;Oh you have to have 9 credits of history and 12 of literature and 6 of foreign language and 6 of psychology and mathematics at least up through calculus (I have never had to figure out the co-sine of anything since college!) and 12 in science to be a theatre major who wants to specialize in singing, acting and dancing.  Blech!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; It troubles me somewhat when I see people proudly proclaiming<br/>\n&gt; themselves to be radical unschoolers in posts full of misspellings and<br/>\n&gt; sentence fragments. Fortunately these are a minority of unschooling<br/>\n&gt; parents, and I tell myself that just as childen survive bab schools<br/>\n&gt; their children will survive their unschooling parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m probably guilty of this some as I type at 70+ wpm and don&#39;t use a spell check.  I string words and phrases together when I e-mail and have had deliciously long run on sentences.  My fingers can hardly keep up with my brain.  I&#39;ve even been to leave a few words out ;-)  LOL!!  And you never know that the person who has the poorest grammar skills won&#39;t be the one that can program circles around you or plays in an orchestra as first chair violin!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I personally do think that childen, when left to themselves, often<br/>\n&gt; choose pursuits that would confound the skeptics. I personally do feel<br/>\n&gt; the need to intervene every so often and assign a specific book that I<br/>\n&gt; know they can read though it might be a bit hard to start -- Kim by<br/>\n&gt; Rudyard Kipling was the last one.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh yes; and I always skip the prologue of The Scarlet Letter LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Our particular sticking point is math, where they are falling somewhat<br/>\n&gt; behind.  I do think an appreciation of algebra and calculus is a good<br/>\n&gt; thing, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do you feel that they are &quot;behind&quot;  Behind still recognizes public or traditional schooling as the standard.  Your children are probably right where they need to be for comprehension.  My kids understand concepts of mathematics better than some of their schooled counterparts.  And although it is one of my own fearful spots (what if my children don&#39;t get math!) I&#39;ve tried to not get anxious because even my 6yo understand multiplication even if he doesn&#39;t know what multiplication is or what the &quot;tables&quot; are.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and it is one of those things like brushing your teeth where<br/>\n&gt; the benefit is not immediately apparent.  Actually, if anyone has a<br/>\n&gt; suggestion on *that* (besides don&#39;t worry about it cause they wll when<br/>\n&gt; they are ready) then I might like to hear it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, teeth-brushing isn&#39;t an option in our house.  I have no guarantees that my kids got my xh&#39;s teeth rather than my teeth.  My xh is 39 and has never had a cavity in his life!  Doesn&#39;t even get plaque!  I&#39;m 40 and currently am missing 3 teeth that I am in the process of having fixed.  Not from lack of brushing.  I have wonderful dental hygeine.  I have horrible dental genes.  I have gorgeous gums (according to my dentist).  My teeth are just brittle and break easily.  I actually have better teeth than my mom and my grandmother had full dentures by the time she was my age!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Perhaps I should describe myself as a mixed or eclectic unschooler,<br/>\n&gt; but I have been around the mulberry bush with the politically correct<br/>\n&gt; on the various lists that I am not much interested in the labels<br/>\n&gt; anymore. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Labels are for people who are insecure with who they are (Can&#39;t remember who said that)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To answer your husband&#39;s concern about college; my own difficulties<br/>\n&gt; along this line are that they tell me that my 14yo is too young and<br/>\n&gt; they won&#39;t even consider him until he&#39;s 16. Otherwise I&#39;d say he&#39;s as<br/>\n&gt; ready as your average community college freshman, math problems and<br/>\n&gt; all.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which doesn&#39;t say much for your average community college freshman&#39;s previous educational experience.  :-)  Think how much more ready your son will be in 2 more years.  And in 2 years he may even have an idea of what he wants to focus on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who has had 6 kids.  3 homeschooled and 3 that went to school at various times in their lives.  Not one child went directly from &quot;high school&quot; to college.  They all took a few years and went an experienced the world.  One kid did missionary work and today is in her last year of seminary to become a UU minister.  Another took odd jobs and opened her own health food store (which is doing well) and is a midwife apprentice.  Another spent 2 years doing odd jobs and saved every penny he had and went touring Europe.  He came home fluent in French and German and now supports himself through his art, tutoring kids in foreign language and playing the guitar.  2 more eventually went to college and did well because they knew what they wanted to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not so sure that many 18yo&#39;s know what their passion may be and I also don&#39;t think that 4 years of &quot;higher education&quot; will help them decide.  There is so much pressure to declare your major and get your coursework started.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3612,"nextTopicId":3783}}
