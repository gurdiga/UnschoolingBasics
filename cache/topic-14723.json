We arranged for her to visit the<br/>\nmiddle school with her best friend in April and she came home saying<br/>\nshe &quot;loved&quot; it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s still on the fence about registering for this September. She<br/>\nrealizes one day isn&#39;t an accurate picture of real school life.  We<br/>\ntalked about her needing to make a decision about going because we&#39;ll<br/>\nneed to get her &quot;caught up&quot; academically and vaccination-wise before<br/>\nthe new school year starts. (I thought once she knew she needed<br/>\nvaccinations she&#39;d change her mind for sure lol!)  I suggested she<br/>\nmake a pros and cons list, but she rightly pointed out that she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know the pros and cons because she&#39;s never really been to<br/>\nschool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is: how much input would you have?  She knows her dad and<br/>\nI want her home, but we don&#39;t want to pressure her.  I&#39;m kind of<br/>\nwishing that I&#39;d been more vocally anti-school while she was growing<br/>\nup, but because we had so many schooled friends and relatives I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever really badmouthed the system.  Didn&#39;t really see a need to, but<br/>\nnow I&#39;m wondering if she doesn&#39;t know enough about why we unschool. <br/>\nIf I tell her what I think now, will she think I&#39;m just trying to<br/>\npersuade her? For us, not going to school has simply been a way of<br/>\nlife.  There was never any &quot;huge&quot; reason why we didn&#39;t send her, but<br/>\nthere are a million good reasons. And how would I tell her how school<br/>\ncan affect her in ways she won&#39;t even realize? These abstact reasons<br/>\nare probably biggest reasons we don&#39;t want her to go, yet for me,<br/>\nthey&#39;re some of the hardest to explain in a way a 12 yo will understand. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as her reasons for wanting to go it seems it&#39;s just natural<br/>\ncuriosity fueling her.  I know her best friend with ulterior motives<br/>\ntries to convince her that school is great, which she thankfully sees<br/>\nthrough, but it&#39;s got her wondering.  She does have plenty of friends,<br/>\nbut most are schooled.  She loved the unschoolers she met at the<br/>\nPeabody Conference and has kept in touch with some.  I think there&#39;s<br/>\nalso some level of her wanting to see &quot;how she would do&quot; grade-wise at<br/>\nschool. This brings up the issue of getting her &quot;caught up&quot;.  I just<br/>\nprinted up the mathematics curriculum framework for 6th grade, (she&#39;d<br/>\nbe entering 7th) and I couldn&#39;t solve the problems myself without<br/>\nstudying up.  I know she could catch up, but honestly don&#39;t know how<br/>\nto teach this stuff.  I actually did very well in Math at school, but<br/>\nof course that knowledge is long gone from my brain!   <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, signing her up for the school year would interfere with several<br/>\ncool plans we had, one of which was a possible trip to Albuquerque in<br/>\nSept. and a trip to Disney in Nov., both of which she was/is excited<br/>\nabout.   Looking at the school dept. website, it looks like they have<br/>\npretty low tolerance for absenteeism.  We were planning a two week RV<br/>\ntrip down to FL and back avoiding the school vacation crowds.  I<br/>\nsuggested maybe we wait until after our trips to start school, but she<br/>\nwanted to start with everyone else in Sept. if she decides to go,<br/>\nwhich I think would probably be best anyway.   So, everything is so up<br/>\nin the air and I need her to decide soon.   I know this is irrelevant,<br/>\nbut it would break our hearts if she decided to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so long, but there are a lot of variables and reading<br/>\nother posts I know it&#39;s best to get out as much info as possible to<br/>\nget applicable advice. Thanks for taking the time!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14698,"nextTopicId":14734}}
