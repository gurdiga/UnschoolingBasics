And one helpful value  <br/>\nis: When life hands you lemons, make lemonade.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when kids say they like school, what does it mean? What are they  <br/>\ncomparing it to? Are they saying they like school better than being  <br/>\nstuck at home with parents off working? Or stuck at home with a mom  <br/>\nwho hovers over them? Or acts as their teacher? What is their home  <br/>\nlike that they&#39;re imagining as the alternative to school? School tends  <br/>\nto tear at relationships so they may not like their parents or  <br/>\nsiblings to spend much time with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect some kids would choose &quot;school&quot;, eg, going to a place to  <br/>\nlearn in a classroom setting if they could choose what they could  <br/>\nlearn. It wouldn&#39;t be much different from college. (College that  <br/>\nsomeone has freely chosen to follow an interest.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I doubt public school -- being required to be there, being  <br/>\nrequired to learn what someone else has chosen for you -- fits any  <br/>\nchild&#39;s personality. But some kids will find enough at school that  <br/>\nthey do like and the rest ignorable to say they enjoy it. Social kids  <br/>\nwho find absorbing information easy would probably say they like  <br/>\nschool. Kids who enjoy sports, music, art and can get by with the  <br/>\nrest, might enjoy it. Kids who like having what to learn laid out for  <br/>\nthem in a neat package might enjoy that part of it. (I liked that. I  <br/>\nliked the sense that learning could come in neat packages. I was also  <br/>\ngood at absorbing information so getting good grades was easy for me.  <br/>\nI&#39;m easy going. The social part was really hard for me, but what  <br/>\nchoice did I have? While I enjoyed home, the learning (on my own)  <br/>\nthere wasn&#39;t as challenging as at school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They�ve been molded, conformed, conditioned...they like their peers,  <br/>\n&gt; social...<br/>\n&gt; ..and what else makes them really LIKE going to school?!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think when imagining why someone would like something we hate, it&#39;s  <br/>\neasy to stop at the assumption that they&#39;re defective, ignorant or  <br/>\nsomehow just bad people. It helps loads in accepting other people to  <br/>\nknow that everyone -- everyone who hasn&#39;t been severely damaged by  <br/>\nlife -- wants pretty much what you want: security, freedom, love,  <br/>\nhappiness. And it helps to imagine how they&#39;re getting the most  <br/>\nimportant of those *to them* met by what they&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would an Unschooler Like school?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why assume all unschoolers are alike? Learning at home doesn&#39;t change  <br/>\nkids inherent personalities.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter enjoys learning in a classroom setting. She didn&#39;t think  <br/>\nmuch of the society at school, didn&#39;t think much of burned out  <br/>\nteachers, and was plenty glad she could choose whether to go or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If school mold, condition , conforms and control and take Freedom-  <br/>\n&gt; why an Unschooler would LIKE going to school?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you speaking of a specific child? Strawmen children can be what  <br/>\nif&#39;d into what sounds like reasonable situations but do those  <br/>\nsituations match any real children?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what do you mean by &quot;school&quot;? Learning in a classroom. Following a  <br/>\ncurriculum? Or being made to go to school. My daughter liked the  <br/>\nfirst. I imagine some kids might like the second. I doubt any would  <br/>\nlike the last *if* the other alternatives were good. Some kids like  <br/>\nschool because it isn&#39;t home.

The school might have opportunities that the family cannot","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-782663282\">An unschooler might like school if it’s his/her *choice* to be there and they can quit anytime.   The school might have opportunities that the family cannot otherwise afford, especially if they live in a  rural area, such as access to a science lab and it’s equipment, or access to an art or music teacher who inspires.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people love and thrive under structure, too, odd as it may seem.  There are other ways to get structure, but school is one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI don’t think it always means that parents “failed” at unschooling.   <br/>\n<br/>\n-Renee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: why kids LIKE school","postDate":"1318692501","msgId":47524,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo3YzhxbCtsOWRrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg1NzZEODc3NDg3NTQ3M0M5N0FGMEQ0MUJBOEM4N0UzQFRoZUZpdHpGYW1pbHk+"},"prevInTopic":47523,"nextInTopic":47525,"prevInTime":47523,"nextInTime":47525,"topicId":47523,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ***************** Some find the social dynamics fascinating, either for a little while or for years.

Some families don&#39;t have the resources to unschool successfully, or the age-appropriate local resources needed by a specific child are all inextricably tied to schools (I&#39;m thinking about team sports and band/orchestra in particular) - but that&#39;s not quite the same as saying the parents did something &quot;wrong&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible to &quot;fail&quot; at unschooling, though, if that&#39;s your question.
