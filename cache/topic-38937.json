A home filled with<br/>\nillnesses and uncertainty, doesn&#39;t need the added energy expended in<br/>\nthinking/worrying about school.  There&#39;s a study somewhere about kids who<br/>\nwere never exposed to school nor school-think and enrolled for the first<br/>\ntime at 12, by 13 they were indistinguishable from their peers. (study makes<br/>\nme sad, though it might bring comfort to this situation)<br/>\n<br/>\nI, personally, wouldn&#39;t look to school as an easy fix in this situation... a<br/>\n9 year old might very easily feel as though they&#39;re being &quot;fired&quot; from their<br/>\njob in the family and could come to see school as a way for the adults to<br/>\nkeep him out of where he really wants to be.  I hope this mama has a support<br/>\nsystem who can help make the next few/many months joyful as they muddle<br/>\nthrough their journey *Together*!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, if school isn&#39;t the easy solution, but perhaps the only one...<br/>\nI&#39;d reassure the child that this is a *for now* solution and when<br/>\ncircumstances change, the school participation can be revisited.  Make clear<br/>\nin THOUGHT WORD & DEED that the child is not being separated from the<br/>\nsituation because of any actions on their part.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is a terminal situation, and there aren&#39;t unschooling options, you<br/>\ncan sure recommend she contact Kelly Lovejoy - who has blanket offered to<br/>\nparent unschooled orphans in their parents&#39; absence.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got more rolling round my head, so if there are more questions and more<br/>\ndetails, I can help some more :D<br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\nhannahbearski.blogspot.com<br/>\nhannahsashes.blogspot.com<br/>\ndianas365.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Mar 17, 2009 at 11:36 AM, Marla B. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marla@...\">marla@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m posting this for a friend who has been very ill and in and out of the<br/>\n&gt; hospital.
