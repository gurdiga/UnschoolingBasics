Certainly this is anecdotal and not a double-blind study and a placebo effect is possible.  (Although frankly I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s &quot;real&quot; or placebo if it results in a more peaceful life!)  However, I&#39;ve tried other things in the past and not seen the kind of improvement I saw after we started the fish oil.  Plus, I actually wasn&#39;t watching for improvement then.  On the contrary, I suddenly thought one day, &quot;Wow!  He&#39;s been doing really, really well for the past couple weeks.  I wonder why?&quot;  And then, trying to figure out if anything was different, I remembered the fish oil.  I hadn&#39;t expected any improvement due to it that quickly, although I had read that some people see a difference in a week or so while others need several months.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of that said, however, this past week has not been so great.

My 7yo&#39;s anger and aggression were bad enough at the time that my 10yo was more than willing to try the diet.  My younger two, 7 and then almost 4, objected but I have to admit I over-ruled it given the intensity of the situation.  (Seriously, I had a couple times when I thought I&#39;d have to call 911.)  However, I made sure to have lots of special foods -- things I wouldn&#39;t normally get, often because of cost (I just decided that at the moment, trying the diet was more important than money).  And we rid the whole house of dairy so it just wasn&#39;t available as a choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, what has seemed to help tremendously in our situation (unless things were just improving drastically for other reasons) was mega-doses of DHA (500mg).<br/>\n<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Rachel &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:radle12000@...\">radle12000@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, March 10, 2007 5:43:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Elimination diet and my 5dd<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n            My 5dd seems to have food sensitivities.
