My hubby does want evidence that they are learning something so I feel I have to prove that we do &quot;school&quot;. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt struck me as I pondered this post how many times spouses, grandparents, and even strangers want proof that unschoolers are learning something.  And yet when kids are in school or having school at home what serves as &quot;proof&quot; is actually a litany of what is being Taught.  &quot;Today we did the 3 Times Table&quot; yes, that was being taught, but did the kid actually learn it??  And even if the kid did the worksheet or passed the test, can they apply it to life?  will they remember it next week?  <br/>\n <br/>\nWith unschooling it tends to look more like the day I handed my youngest a dollar in case she and her sisters wanted to buy candy after they played at the park.  She was concerned that their friends wouldn&#39;t have money to spend.  Then she looked at the dollar and said, &quot;I could buy 4 Air Heads with this.&quot;  And she continued to give 3 other spending options that would provide more than one treat.  When my girls were in school the teachers would comment on how kids these days struggle with coin amounts and doing math related to money because so few people use &quot;real money.&quot;  The pretend plastic coins and work sheets at school can&#39;t compare to holding real coins in their hand.  On top of that, w/ shopping they are learning a host of real life skills and money math painlessly.<br/>\n <br/>\n:)<br/>\nJenna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;What&#39;s the matter with you?

You can&#39;t know the future, after all, you can&#39;t know what they will &quot;need&quot; or when. No-one knows that. Schools don&#39;t, so they try to provide a catch-all, a &quot;well rounded education&quot; that, as the vast majority of parents, university professors and employers will complain, doesn&#39;t prepare them for their adult lives very well at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help to think about this on two fronts on the one hand, what will benefit your kids Right Now? What sorts of things will enliven the worlds of a six and 7 year old? What do your kids enjoy? Do and offer those things. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, consider what sorts of skills are most useful for adults  not just academics, that&#39;s really the easy part, but what things are valuable to people. What kinds of People do you hope your kids will be? The good news is, you don&#39;t have to teach those things! You can, instead, work on being more of those things, yourself. If you want to bring more joy into your children&#39;s lives, look for ways to be joyful. If you want to bring more confidence into their lives, develop your own confidence, your own sense of self. If you want them to have lives full of generosity, be generous to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasic &quot;academic&quot; skills  the 3Rs  are Basic. What your kids need to know they can learn without teaching - which isn&#39;t the same as &quot;on their own&quot;! Kids need parents! They don&#39;t need parents shoving information at them, however. They need support, encouragement, sometimes a sounding-board, and sometimes a shoulder. They need choices and a chance to shine. They don&#39;t need drills or dull plodding through materials. That&#39;s a method for getting people to pass tests in the short run, but the vast majority of that so-called learning is forgotten the moment the test is over. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I want as a Mom to make sure my kids grow up happy and well educated<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What do you mean by &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;well educated&quot;? Its useful to think about that, especially, because those ideas can be in conflict! Do you worry if one of your children becomes an electrician rather than a CPA he&#39;ll be less happy? Those are the kinds of concerns that can cause you to push &quot;education&quot; over happiness without realizing it  my parents did, with the best intentions in the world! And it has taken me years to come to value my own happiness.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Is it okay to let one child build all day (tents, forts, club houses and tower from all sorts of stuff) and the other to do arts all day? Are they really learning anything?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is part of what I mean! Kids learn all day long, and most of that learning looks like play. Not all of the learning going on is &quot;academic&quot; in nature (although there&#39;s some of that, enough to report to the state if you can learn how to look) but its all very real none-the-less. One of the things kids learn by playing what motivates them. Making a tent or tower involves working out some problems  a nice logic puzzle, some math and physics if you want to see some academics, but beyond that, they&#39;re learning how to handle frustration when things Don&#39;t work, they&#39;re learning what motivates them, as individuals, to continue. That&#39;s not something kids *get* to learn about very well if they&#39;re learning for someone else&#39;s purposes  they learn about being motivated from the outside, but not from the inside. Unschoolers get to learn about motivation from the inside  it&#39;s a valuable thing to learn!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Should I make them play games?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No! Invite them, if you really want to play a game with them, but don&#39;t spoil the joy of a game by making it a lesson. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just got a game called Bananagrams  do you know it? It&#39;s a scrabble variant, played without a board. Anyway, my 8yo still uses a lot of invented spellings, so the first thing we did, when my partner and I got ready to play and Mo asked &quot;can I play too?&quot; was to let her know that *she* was welcome to spell things her way. Now, I could give you plenty of very educational reasons why that&#39;s okay, the study of learning is a substantial hobby of mine, but the *real* reason was so that we could all sit around and play the game together as a family and enjoy ourselves. Play games with your kids like that  for the enjoyment of the game and the enjoyment of doing things together. It won&#39;t hurt them, in the sense of undermining learning, I promise. It Will allow them to learn about happiness from the inside, not as something to which they can aspire (I want you to be happy) but something that&#39;s a part of their real lives, right now. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;My hubby does want evidence that they are learning something<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What does he consider evidence? It might help to let him know that, while you value your kids&#39; education, you need some time to do more research on the subject. Point out, if it helps him, the things that are obvious to you, and let him know you&#39;ll get back to him on the rest. Buy yourself some time to observe your children&#39;s play and time to figure out how to &quot;interpret&quot; that play as learning. You might want to get a book like &quot;Literacy Through Play&quot; to get you started, or, if you want something with a broader base: &quot;Learning all the Time&quot; or &quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, invite your dh into your daily world. Tell him what fun things the kids have done each day, what were the joys. Give him something to carry with him to work to feel good about supporting y&#39;all&#39;s endeavors, even if he doesn&#39;t quite understand them, yet. Let him know how much you, personally, value him, and offer him plenty of love and care  it helps! Connection and care are at the heart of unschooling, and many partners are &quot;won over&quot; by getting plenty of  the same. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337268401,"authorName":"Amanda","from":"&quot;Amanda&quot; &lt;amanda_mendenhall@...&gt;","profile":"saabgirl88","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: New..and yes I have questions, please","postDate":"1262989294","msgId":42816,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhpOGI1ZStwaDZ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDI3Njc0NC44NDM4My5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":42810,"nextInTopic":42820,"prevInTime":42815,"nextInTime":42817,"topicId":42805,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My 6 year old is into anything hands on, science ex. arts and crafts, cooking, baking that sort of things.  My 7 year old is harder to tell, he likes building and he reads sometimes by himself.  I don&#39;t know...I guess I am looking for suggestions on starting and record keeping.  Is it okay to let one child build all day (tents, forts, club houses and tower from all sorts of stuff) and the other to do arts all day?  Are they really learning anything?  What about math?  The last couple of days I have been pulling out different games to get a way from the workbooks yet still feel like they are getting something.  Should I make them play games?  I know this is long and for that i am sorry.  I thank you for all your help and suggestions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAmanda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42738,"nextTopicId":42832}}
