What she said is that it was a bad example  <br/>\nfor an unschooling list, because there wouldn&#39;t be a situation like that. <br/>\n <br/>\nSomething brought you here. If you just wanted all your old choices to  <br/>\ncontinue, you wouldn&#39;t be exploring unschooling. But, for a moment, let&#39;s look  at <br/>\nYOUR example.<br/>\n <br/>\nI used to work at a day care center before my son was born (almost 15 years  <br/>\nago!!!).  It was a good, child-centered, non-academic,  old-hippy-founded <br/>\nplace.  Periodically a parent would drop their kid  off in pj&#39;s because they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t get ready. And the idea IS to embarass the kid  into getting ready when <br/>\nthey&#39;re told to. <br/>\n <br/>\nBecause if it weren&#39;t, wouldn&#39;t the logical thing to do be to bring the kid  <br/>\nin pj&#39;s and just say, &quot;Mischa wasn&#39;t ready to get dressed yet, but here are <br/>\nher  clothes if she wants them.&quot; Or bring them to change quickly in the car? Or <br/>\nput  her in sweatpants and shirt to bed so changing in the morning wasn&#39;t even <br/>\n important?<br/>\n <br/>\nYep, you were a single mom and had to get places. As a result of that,  maybe <br/>\nyou had to make choices that were NOT child-centered or even what you  <br/>\nwanted. You REALLY wanted a super-compliant kid who just did what you needed  when <br/>\nyou needed it. Nobody&#39;s a bad person, and maybe it was what had to happen  at <br/>\nthe time. Maybe down the road you&#39;ll see other things you could have done  <br/>\ninstead. Hey, we all do...probably on a weekly basis!<br/>\n <br/>\nBut now you&#39;re at THIS part of the journey. The stuff you needed (or  thought <br/>\nyou needed) to do before isn&#39;t necessarily what is best for  unschooling.<br/>\n <br/>\nRen wasn&#39;t being disrespectful of your experience. She was letting you  know, <br/>\ngently really, that this example is meaningless to unschoolers. It&#39;s a  <br/>\ndifferent journey entirely.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn  <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn  Baptista, Conference Coordinator<br/>\n<br/>\nCome to the Live and Learn Unschooling  Conference August 27-29 in Peabody, <br/>\nMA!<br/>\nFor more information, go to  www.LiveandLearnConference.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2921,"nextTopicId":2960}}
