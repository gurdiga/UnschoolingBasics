My mom would have come to that Conference and playe dwith the kids. Its not optimal but doable. But if you are in a venue that does not have a place for kids than what do you do ?? Specially if you have nursing ones and you are hours away from home.<br/>\nAnyway. I was not trying to bash the Conference. I am sure the organizers have been working really hard on it and I hope it is a sucess. I t lookd like is going to be great and I wanted to go.<br/>\nMaybe in the future things will chage and there will be a way for moms like me to attend. I am sure my kids would also enjoy it as they did at L and L. <br/>\nAlex<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Laura Kostick &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lkoz2@...\">lkoz2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, December 29, 2007 10:41:41 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: The Unschooling Confernece- Alex?<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Alex~<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere do you live?
