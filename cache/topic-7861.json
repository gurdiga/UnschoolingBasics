But thank you to all from the bottom of my heart for all of your insight and wisdom<br/>\nand advice and help!  I&#39;ve calmed down today.  I regret that my first few postings to this group<br/>\nwere complaints and drama.  (maybe a little seasonal depression coming on that caused me to be so<br/>\ndarned emotional and riled up- I haven&#39;t been myself lately.)  Dh was very sympathetic when he<br/>\ncame home and made sure I was ok.  I did a bit of calm thinking and started reading Teach Your<br/>\nOwn.  I got through the intro before CSI came on (GOT to watch CSI!) and one sentence that really<br/>\nstruck a chord with me was, &quot;In a nutshell, people whose lives are hard, boring, painful,<br/>\nmeaningless - people who suffer - tend to resent those who seem to suffer less than they do, and<br/>\nwill make them suffer if they can.&quot;  I never saw parenting or school in this light before.  I&#39;m<br/>\ngoing to be more aware of this in the future.  Dh & I had a similar discussion to the one<br/>\nyesterday about spanking when the kids were toddlers- well, a few times, actually.  I gave in, and<br/>\nspanked the kids for a while.  I couldn&#39;t deal with the guilt, and I stopped doing it.  After a<br/>\nwhile, he stopped, too.  He saw my methods were as or more effective, and drew his own conclusion.<br/>\n I guess that&#39;s my big lesson.  Just like you can&#39;t force a child to learn without causing him to<br/>\nfear the world, you can&#39;t force a grown man to think the way you do without causing fear in him,<br/>\nas well.  But thanks again to all who&#39;ve given advice, links, and support.  It&#39;s good to know that<br/>\nothers have been in the same situation and have had it work out successfully.  I have faith that<br/>\nit will for us, too, in it&#39;s own time.   (And rarely does anything worthwhile come easily ;-})<br/>\n<br/>\nAnastasia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7855,"nextTopicId":7877}}
