I would simply tell anyone who thinks that my<br/>\nson needs to learn something that he is busy learning other things right now<br/>\nand math isn&#39;t as important as those things right now in his life. If you<br/>\nwould like more information on my philosophy of teaching I can recommend a<br/>\nfew good books or websites to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important thing to remember is that your child&#39;s grandparents are<br/>\ndoing what they think is best because they love your child not because they<br/>\nwant to irritate you. When many of us started homeschooling or unschooling<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t truly &quot;get it&quot; either. It has only been through the information<br/>\nand support of this group that I remember to let go and let my child be a<br/>\nchild.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she truly wants to teach him math maybe the two of you can compromise?<br/>\nMaybe baking with Grandma and they could work on making a recipe larger or<br/>\nsmaller. A practical application that would be fun and make Grandma happy<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you just want her to back off then I would tell her as unemotionally as<br/>\npossible that you understand that she is doing what she believes is best but<br/>\nthat until she has educated herself on the philosophy of learning that you<br/>\nhave chosen, she needs to not concern herself with his learning and just be<br/>\ncontent being a Grandmother who loves and spoils her grandkids. <br/>\n<br/>\nShannon <br/>\n<br/>\n~&gt;|&lt;~.~&gt;|&lt;~.~&gt;|&lt;~.~&gt;|&lt;~.~&gt;|&lt;~.~&gt;|&lt;~ <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Lisa H<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 09, 2006 9:03 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Meddling grandparent<br/>\n<br/>\nAs inconvenient as it may be to not have your mother available to baby-sit<br/>\nfor you, I would suggest perhaps not leaving your child alone with your mom.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom didn&#39;t get anything i had to say about our home education philosophy<br/>\nand only got defensive (and angry) when i questioned her pov.
