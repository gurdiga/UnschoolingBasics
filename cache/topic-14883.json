A typical evening around here <br/>\nconsists of Daddy getting home from work, supper together with <br/>\ndiscussions ranging from funny happenings, interesting things, <br/>\nanimals, etc. seen, stories of who made who mad and why and how it <br/>\nwas resolved, and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter taking dishes over to the sink, we end up outside for the <br/>\nevening, checking out the garden (digging potatoes, picking green <br/>\nbeans, checking tomatoes, etc.), watering flowers, watching the <br/>\nchickens and baby chicks, riding bikes, and - what the kids LOVE to <br/>\ndo lately - playing baseball with Daddy.  They play catch, run to the <br/>\nbases, hit the ball, and they would go all night if it didn&#39;t get <br/>\ndark.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s so relaxing and pleasing to hear the birds, see the wildlife, <br/>\nand enjoy each other&#39;s company.  This is the second summer we have <br/>\nsuspended our satellite service (you can suspend it up to six <br/>\nmonths), because we don&#39;t want to pay for it when we&#39;re outside or on <br/>\nthe go during this time of year.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTrudy Powell</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14882,"nextTopicId":14904}}
