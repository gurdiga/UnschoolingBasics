As a matter of fact I was born and raised in MS, went to school in GA and live in TN and I DON&quot;T fit in either.  The way you describe yourself is very similar to how I would describe my interaction with other hsing mothers.  I have decided that I try to meet them on common ground but realize that there will only be the few who I truly come to trust.  I have found that I am a bit cautious with speaking about unschooling because curricula seem to be the rave in the hsing community.  I am still trying to figure out why do school at home.  Our children&#39;s learning should be radically different is how I am seeing it these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway, I feel good reading your words because they very accurately describe me, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch Love<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: k <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, November 19, 2005 1:55 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Deschooling Dilemma<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Personality conflicts.

He felt helpless and at a loss about almost everytihng. His &quot;friends&quot; kept telling him he&#39;d be stupid. The homeschoolers we met were just plain weird. He really wasn&#39;t happy.<br/>\n <br/>\nTime helped. Patience (on both our parts). The only thing he *finally* wanted to do was to skateboard (ugh!), so we fed that as much as posssible. But the kids he was skating with were schooled and so added to that turmoil.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe really kept a low profile for a very long time---just so uncomfortable with himself. But the skating led to filming, and he made some film-friends---most of whom were older than he was. He felt so much more comfortable around people in their twenties; he started hanging around them and their friends. He had a friend in his forties (also a friend of ours). Then the film-making led to musicians---and THAT&#39;s where he found his REAL passion! <br/>\n <br/>\nAgain---he hangs out with guys in their twenties. They don&#39;t tell him he&#39;s going to be stupid---in fact, most of them wish they had his life when they were his age! &lt;g&gt; They&#39;re all pursuing their passions.<br/>\n <br/>\nHis schooled friends are now drowning in school and busywork and unconcerned parents. It&#39;s sad.<br/>\n <br/>\nCameron, after four years of struggling with who he is, is finally SOOO comfortable with who he is! I blame school (and my school mind-set) for that horrible damage done to my bright, eager, smart baby.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe had nothing to do with the conference the first three years, and he refused to go to Not Back to School Camp even though I suggested it every single year it&#39;s been on the east coast. He finally agreed to go this year. He&#39;s a changed man! He found so many people *just* like him---he fit right in the moment he stepped out of the car!<br/>\n <br/>\nHe thoroughly enjoyed the conference this year and was surrounded by other unschoolers who are just as comfortable as he is. It was wonderful!<br/>\n <br/>\nI cannot stress enough the NEED for unschooling children to be connected with other unschooling children! (Helps the parents a lot too!) In the case of a lack of unschoolers, try young adults with the same passions.<br/>\n <br/>\nTime and Patience too! Be as interested and as interesting as *you* can be too!<br/>\n <br/>\nThis age is hard---especially when just out of school. Get her to Not Back to School Camp if at all possible---there are scholarships available. The conference would help her immensely too!

Danielle is going <br/>\nthrough the adjustment of being home since this past June, <br/>\ndeschooling has finally hit a &quot;wall&quot;, I&#39;m not sure how to handle it.  <br/>\nShe says she doesn&#39;t know &quot;what to do&quot;.  We&#39;ve talked about her <br/>\npursuing things she&#39;s interested in, but it&#39;s so ingrained in her to <br/>\nbe led and told what to do next, that I think she&#39;s having a hard <br/>\ntime being &quot;free&quot;.  So, I&#39;m thinking I need to start scheduling some <br/>\nthings for us to do, to get her out and about (SHE wanted to &quot;chill&quot; <br/>\nat first, and NOT do any of the planned outings etc that our local <br/>\nhomeschool group plans, which I respected).  We talked about that <br/>\nlast night, and she agrees.  Part of it I think is that her closest <br/>\nfriend (she met her in summer camp 2 yrs ago, lives 2 towns away) is <br/>\nin school, they talk every day, and I think she&#39;s missing the social <br/>\npart of being in school.  Being an only child too, I think she&#39;s <br/>\nbeginning to feel a bit alienated, even though, again, she usually <br/>\nlikes her alone time.  We talked about the reasons we chose to <br/>\nhomeschool, the difficulties she&#39;s had with transitions at school, <br/>\nfalling behind, her learning style not fitting in with how they teach <br/>\netc etc.  I wanted to give her the time to deschool, but now I&#39;m <br/>\nfeeling a bit lost.  I&#39;m committed to unschooling, but I wonder if <br/>\nshe needs a bit of structure (not &quot;school at home&quot; structure, but <br/>\nplanned activities).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had a lot of other issues to deal with, my MIL being moved a <br/>\ncouple of weeks ago from assisted living to an Alzheimer&#39;s nursing <br/>\nfacility, her house is still not sold, we&#39;ve had to go to the Cape a <br/>\nlot (100 miles away) to do some cosmetic improvements. Because of all <br/>\nthat&#39;s been going on with my MIL etc, it&#39;s worked that Danielle has <br/>\nhad some space and I could help my husband get through all this <br/>\n(well, there&#39;s still the house for sale), plus I&#39;VE had to adjust to <br/>\nbeing home (I&#39;ve ALWAYS worked full time, it&#39;s been more of a culture <br/>\nshock than I thought, although I&#39;ve been busy with all that&#39;s been <br/>\ngoing on in our lives).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s easier to homeschool from the beginning, and it&#39;s hard <br/>\nto find kids in her age group whether they&#39;ve been home from the <br/>\nbeginning or were pulled from school (or like minded people, which is <br/>\nwhat I eventually hope more for, finding others who share her <br/>\npassions, no matter their age, and she&#39;s STUCK (so much for child-led <br/>\nlearning!)).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked last night about all this (it&#39;s the second time it&#39;s come <br/>\nup in the past couple of weeks) and she said she think she might like <br/>\nto try high school (which would be 2 years from now, she would have <br/>\nbeen in 7th grade this year).

Because of <br/>\n&gt; all <br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s been going on with my MIL etc, it&#39;s worked that Danielle <br/>\n&gt; has <br/>\n&gt; had some space and I could help my husband get through all this <br/>\n&gt; (well, there&#39;s still the house for sale), plus I&#39;VE had to adjust <br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; being home (I&#39;ve ALWAYS worked full time, it&#39;s been more of a <br/>\n&gt; culture <br/>\n&gt; shock than I thought, although I&#39;ve been busy with all that&#39;s been <br/>\n&gt; going on in our lives).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s easier to homeschool from the beginning, and it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; hard <br/>\n&gt; to find kids in her age group whether they&#39;ve been home from the <br/>\n&gt; beginning or were pulled from school (or like minded people, which <br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; what I eventually hope more for, finding others who share her <br/>\n&gt; passions, no matter their age, and she&#39;s STUCK (so much for child-<br/>\n&gt; led <br/>\n&gt; learning!)).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We talked last night about all this (it&#39;s the second time it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; come <br/>\n&gt; up in the past couple of weeks) and she said she think she might <br/>\n&gt; like <br/>\n&gt; to try high school (which would be 2 years from now, she would <br/>\n&gt; have <br/>\n&gt; been in 7th grade this year).  I feel it&#39;s the social aspect she&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; missing, even though she didn&#39;t have a lot of friends and many of <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; kids thought she was &quot;weird&quot;.  I realize this is in the future, <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; we talked about how she would have to prepare to be able to do the <br/>\n&gt; work at the 9th grade level if she decided to return to school.   <br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think she understands what this would entail.   One of the <br/>\n&gt; main <br/>\n&gt; reasons she&#39;s so far been enjoying NOT being in school is that she <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t have to feel the pressure of &quot;learning&quot; things that they <br/>\n&gt; say <br/>\n&gt; she has to and following their time table.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I could really use some words of wisdom.<br/>\n&gt; Jann<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

We live in North Reading - where are you <br/>\nlocated?  She was so stressed at the end of 6th grade because she <br/>\nneeds more time to transition, and really does best if allowed to <br/>\nfinish what she&#39;s &quot;working on&quot; to completion, and of course this <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t happen in middle school, the bell rings and they have to drop <br/>\nwhat they&#39;re doing and move on.   She kept falling more and more <br/>\nbehind, even trying to help her at night didn&#39;t do it.   She doesn&#39;t <br/>\nenjoy reading for pleasure, hated what they were doing in math, she <br/>\nloves her computer and video games, is not a girly girl, is cautious <br/>\nby nature, also a bit of a worrier and of course the hormonal changes <br/>\nare starting to be felt (we talk a lot about it, oh, and she&#39;s a <br/>\ntalker, which is great because it helps her to be able to express <br/>\nwhat&#39;s on her mind (sometimes we have to talk about it SEVERAL times, <br/>\nbut that&#39;s just part of her anxious nature)).

My sons are 12 soon to be 13   and have only been out of school for three years.   I did school at home at first so their deschooling has really only been over the last year or so.  Even with that I find that they look to the outside for motivation alot and look to me and the homeschooling cooperative we&#39;re a part of for structure.  I often wonder what is the balance of structuring activities that they seem to want to do and giving them just alot alot of open unstructured &quot;play&quot; time.  They grew up (regrettably from my point of view, now) in a school setting.  I see how &quot;comfortable&quot; (read compliant) they are with schoolish settings.  (They wanted to join some activities in the homeschooling coop to be with other kids, it seems to me they tolerate/comply with schoolish kind of activities in order to have the opportunity to socialize. )  But I do invite kids from the coop situation over for &quot;just&quot; fun activities . . . so I realize I need to make opportunities for them to socialize that are not just around classes or expressed interests.  Also, in speaking with families who have unschooled always or alot longer than we have, this is the age that some unschooled young people decide to pursue more schoolish skills.  So, at the same time I certainly don&#39;t want to keep my sons from writing or computation or any and all reading that they might want to do.  Perhaps I&#39;m sounding too cynical, or I&#39;m tending to throw the  baby out with the bath water and keep them from activities that seem schoolish to me.

Danielle is going <br/>\nthrough the adjustment of being home since this past June, <br/>\ndeschooling has finally hit a &quot;wall&quot;, I&#39;m not sure how to handle it.  <br/>\nShe says she doesn&#39;t know &quot;what to do&quot;.  We&#39;ve talked about her <br/>\npursuing things she&#39;s interested in, but it&#39;s so ingrained in her to <br/>\nbe led and told what to do next, that I think she&#39;s having a hard <br/>\ntime being &quot;free&quot;.  So, I&#39;m thinking I need to start scheduling some <br/>\nthings for us to do, to get her out and about (SHE wanted to &quot;chill&quot; <br/>\nat first, and NOT do any of the planned outings etc that our local <br/>\nhomeschool group plans, which I respected).  We talked about that <br/>\nlast night, and she agrees.  Part of it I think is that her closest <br/>\nfriend (she met her in summer camp 2 yrs ago, lives 2 towns away) is <br/>\nin school, they talk every day, and I think she&#39;s missing the social <br/>\npart of being in school.  Being an only child too, I think she&#39;s <br/>\nbeginning to feel a bit alienated, even though, again, she usually <br/>\nlikes her alone time.
