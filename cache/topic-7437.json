At age 3 my DS was sleeping from 9 pm to 8 am quite happily <br/>\n(that&#39;s a good 11 hrs of sleep). Maybe do the bath and teeth and pjs <br/>\nbetween 7 and 8 as an intro to &#39;quieter time&#39;. Then, since they&#39;re all <br/>\npjd and sweet and ready for bed, put on a quiet favorite movie (fun <br/>\nbut gentle) and snuggle on the couch together - odds are, if they&#39;re <br/>\ntired, they&#39;ll be asleep before it ends. Make sure it&#39;s a favorite <br/>\nmovie - one they already know - so that there&#39;s no &quot;what happens <br/>\nnext?&quot; to keep them awake - they know what happens and can watch it <br/>\nover and over so no urgent reason to stay awake. If anyone is still <br/>\nawake afterward, then story time in bed. Or, use quiet music or <br/>\nsomething. Generally, I&#39;ve found that if I can help DS (now 7 1/2) to <br/>\nslow down for 5 minutes, if he&#39;s tired, he&#39;ll be asleep. So, we have <br/>\nfavorite movies, TV programs, books to read, etc and we choose -each <br/>\nevening- what we&#39;ll do (currently, and since mid summer this year, <br/>\nit&#39;s Who&#39;s Line is it Anyway? which is on around 10 pm most nights, <br/>\nsometimes earlier, sometimes later and that&#39;s fine since DS will sleep <br/>\nuntil he&#39;s done, whether that&#39;s 7 am or 9 am). I&#39;m the one with the <br/>\nstrictest bedtime - I&#39;m at work between 7:30 and 8:00 am Mon-Fri so I <br/>\ntake myself off to bed around 9 or 9:30 and my guys (DH and DS) tend <br/>\ntowant to come snuggle before I&#39;m totally asleep. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, find out what it is that they are wanting to stay awake for - is <br/>\nit to watch a program, play a game, play with particular toys? When DS <br/>\nwas littler, he&#39;d often head to bed with his matchbox cars (the <br/>\nfavorite du jour) and after storytime he&#39;d sit in bed and play with <br/>\nthem a bit until he fell asleep - then I&#39;d go back into his room and <br/>\nmove them off to the small bookcase (doubled as a nightstand with his <br/>\ntouchlamp - 3 way cool shade touch lamp - best investment for a kid&#39;s <br/>\nroom ever!) that was next to his bed so he could see them right off <br/>\nbut not wake up with tire treads on his face.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: baby steps to radical unschooling","postDate":"1131135791","msgId":7537,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlCRkZDNzBCLTBERTQtNENENy1CNzNCLUQ3MTAwNTM0QzREN0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRrZzhqYytscW02QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRrZzhqYytscW02QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7533,"nextInTopic":7538,"prevInTime":7536,"nextInTime":7538,"topicId":7437,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You might need to think ahead more -- you re building a relationship and you might want to consider whether you want it to be based on you being an","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1774454401\">You might need to &quot;think ahead&quot; more -- you&#39;re building a  <br/>\nrelationship and you might want to consider whether you want it to be  <br/>\nbased on you being an &quot;enforcer&quot; or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you might want to work a bit at being very aware of what is  <br/>\ngoing through your child&#39;s mind. For example, you say, &quot;Ten more  <br/>\nminutes until bedtime, sweeties,&quot; and the child says, &quot;But I&#39;m  <br/>\nplaying.&quot; You say, &quot;I know, and you have ten more minutes to wind it  <br/>\nup for the night.&quot; (All done nicely and calmly, I&#39;m sure.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo WHAT is the child thinking?

That proves she loves  <br/>\nme.&quot; And we hope they&#39;ll take this time to slow down their play, get  <br/>\ncalmer, think sweet sleepy thoughts, be preparing for bedtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are they really likely to be thinking?<br/>\n&quot;Oh no. She&#39;s doing it again. JUST when we&#39;re having so much fun. Why  <br/>\ndo WE have to go to bed when SHE doesn&#39;t? It isn&#39;t FAIR. She doesn&#39;t  <br/>\ncare. She&#39;s selfish. She&#39;s so mean.&quot; And, &quot;I&#39;m going to play as hard  <br/>\nas I can and squeeze as much as possible into those 10  <br/>\nminutes.&quot; (Frantic, impatient type of play ensues.) AND, &quot;Maybe if we  <br/>\nplay really quietly and even move to the other room, she&#39;ll  <br/>\nforget.&quot; (Sneaky.) Or, &quot;What&#39;s the use, she&#39;ll win in the end, might  <br/>\nas well just go along.&quot; (apathy)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d just like to suggest that you might want to keep your  <br/>\nrelationship in the forefront of your mind at all times - what you  <br/>\nbuild now will BE the relationship you have when they are teens. If  <br/>\nyou&#39;re building resentment, avoidance, sneaky feelings, or apathy  <br/>\nnow, you&#39;ll see those later. People are often so worried about what  <br/>\nis going to happen when their lovely sweet little children grow into  <br/>\nteens, renowned for being difficult, etc. Well - it isn&#39;t random  <br/>\naccident when teens turn out to continue to care about what their  <br/>\nparents think, to listen to them, to enjoy being with them, and so  <br/>\non. It is thoughtful mindful parenting throughout their childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Just to be clear, I&#39;m not saying having parent-imposed bedtimes  <br/>\nis going to lead to difficult rebellious teenagers &lt;G&gt;. Too simple.  <br/>\nI&#39;m saying bedtimes are a good, clear issue that parents can think  <br/>\nabout and that thinking can really help them become better parents  <br/>\noverall.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 4, 2005, at 10:17 AM, lreinbach wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -<br/>\n&gt;&gt; They are very little.

How can there be a balance?<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nThey&#39;re still *really* little. I can&#39;t imagine that they&#39;re even able to stay up too late! But <br/>\nI have two big sleepers, so I&#39;m always amazed at how late other kids can keep going! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI think it&#39;s much more important that they learn to give you space when you need it than to set<br/>\nup arbitrary bedtimes in order to get it. But they are really little! I&#39;ll use my Aunt Celie&#39;s <br/>\nadvice: enjoy it while you got it &#39;cause you&#39;re gonna miss it when it&#39;s gone!<br/>\n <br/>\nENJOY the time you play with them and sit with them while they watch tv! It won&#39;t last forever!<br/>\nAnd you WILL miss it when they move on to bigger and better things! <br/>\n <br/>\nI understand the need to have alone time. I get mine mostly in the mornings---no one&#39;s awake at <br/>\n6:30 but me & the dogs! &lt;G&gt; You may need to alter your scheduled alone time! &lt;g&gt; But you can <br/>\nalso explain to them how you need some quiet time in the evenings. They may want to just fall <br/>\nasleep in your arms as you watch tv or read. But again---they are sooo little! I bet with a <br/>\nlittle warm milk (or nursing), a bath, and a few books or songs, they would be asleep anyway <br/>\nwithin 1/2 hour!<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;re NOT saying that such young children should be awake until you retire @ midnight! But you <br/>\n*can* make bedtime a pleasant time FOR them---something they look forward to---even if that <br/>\nmeans you get 1/2 hour less time for yourself alone. <br/>\n <br/>\nAre they not tired at the end of the day? Do they *want* to stay up? Do they fight sleep? Do <br/>\n*you* understand that they&#39;ll sleep when they&#39;re tired? Won&#39;t they???<br/>\n~Kelly Kelly LovejoyConference CoordinatorLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1224177,"authorName":"Saulithyia@aol.com","from":"Saulithyia@...","profile":"saulithyia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: baby steps to radical unschooling","postDate":"1131061411","msgId":7495,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzZS4xZjg2M2ZkYi4zMDliZmFhM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7493,"nextInTopic":7500,"prevInTime":7494,"nextInTime":7496,"topicId":7437,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/3/2005 6:18:12 PM Eastern Standard Time, laura@reinbach.com writes: My  kids(ages 4 and 2.5) have a bedtime and it is mainly so I can","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1119839526\">In a message dated 11/3/2005 6:18:12 PM Eastern Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laura@...\">laura@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy  kids(ages 4 and 2.5) have a bedtime and it is mainly so I can have<br/>\nsome  quiet time in the evening to watch tv or read.

It doesn&#39;t mean lights out, in bed, go to sleep. They go hang out in  <br/>\ntheir rooms for some down time. My daughter will quietly play dolls on her <br/>\nbed,  or look at books. My son will look at books, play with Leap Pad, play with <br/>\nhim  Thomas trains, whatever strikes his fancy. My daughter will fall asleep <br/>\nwith her  light on. My son will ask to be tucked in when he&#39;s ready.<br/>\nTonight, &quot;bedtime&quot; is being pushed back because my daughter asked to watch  <br/>\nher new Cinderella movie she got for her birthday. My son will watch it too, <br/>\nbut  he is sitting here playing with some random toys as well. And I am still <br/>\ngetting  to do as I please. My favorite TV shows will be on later, and they will <br/>\nmost  likely be asleep by then :o)  <br/>\n<br/>\nJenny<br/>\nHomeschooling in Greenfield, MA<br/>\nDanny (12-1-99), Kelsey  (11-1-01) and Evelyn (5-19-04)<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nEducation is not filling a pail but the lighting of a  fire.  ~William Butler <br/>\nYeats<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: baby steps to radical unschooling","postDate":"1131060555","msgId":7493,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhBMTQ2OTFCLThDOEUtNERGMS1CRTI2LTZGQTk4N0UyQkNEN0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRrZTVwMitwN2g3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRrZTVwMitwN2g3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7491,"nextInTopic":7495,"prevInTime":7492,"nextInTime":7494,"topicId":7437,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"They are very little.

Do they resist going to bed? Do you have an  <br/>\narbitrary time and it is &quot;time&quot; no matter what else is going on? Do  <br/>\nyou make them quit happily being involved in something because it is  <br/>\nbedtime RIGHT NOW? Do you have a sweet and calm bedtime routine that  <br/>\nhelps them transition to sleeping time?<br/>\n<br/>\nI, personally, think it is great to have a quiet time most evenings  <br/>\nwhen you know the kids are tired and pretty close to ready to sleep  <br/>\nand you turn the lights down and the noise level down and you get  <br/>\npj&#39;s on and have warm milk and get teeth brushed and do something  <br/>\nthat transitions to sleep for the little ones - watch a soft and  <br/>\ngentle and often-watched movie, read well-loved stories (not the time  <br/>\nfor new and exciting ones).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might do that and call it &quot;bedtime.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when we talk about not having bedtimes, we&#39;re not talking about  <br/>\nthat - we&#39;re talking about those parents who say: &quot;You must be in bed  <br/>\nat 7:30 pm whether you&#39;re sleepy or not and if you&#39;re not, well, you  <br/>\ncan just LIE there and rest.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think lots of us probably did the family bed thing - so the concept  <br/>\nof &quot;sending the kids off to bed&quot; didn&#39;t really enter into our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my oldest, when it seemed she was getting sleepy, I&#39;d lie down  <br/>\nwith her and I&#39;d sing, every night, until she went to sleep. I  <br/>\nsometimes had to cajole her into lying down, because she was a go-go- <br/>\ngo-go kid, never wanted to rest. STILL like that. MANY nights that  <br/>\nwas it for me, too, I&#39;d be out for the night. Second kid was one who  <br/>\nwould SAY she was sleepy and want me to go tuck her in, maybe sing a  <br/>\nsong or two, never more than that. Before she was four, she started  <br/>\nreading and from then on she&#39;d go get into her own bed with a PILE of  <br/>\nbooks to read and would always fall asleep with a book in her hand.  <br/>\nThird kid just fell asleep anywhere, anytime. Still does that at 14.  <br/>\nVery often watching tv and sometimes with a book over her face &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 3, 2005, at 3:16 PM, lreinbach wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My kids(ages 4 and 2.5) have a bedtime and it is mainly so I can have<br/>\n&gt; some quiet time in the evening to watch tv or read.

Slowly let go of rules and start <br/>\nliving by principles, I have mentioned it a couple of times but a <br/>\nreally good starting point for me was the book Living Joyfully With <br/>\nChildren.  I think it is also really good to see it in action, that is <br/>\nwhat convinced me on several issues, it didn&#39;t make sense to read <br/>\nabout it but when I saw it in action it all made sense!  Do you know <br/>\nany radical unschoolers that you could hang out with now and then?  <br/>\nMaybe try to meet some.  I think just being very conscious of what <br/>\nyour children are feeling, their perceptions of situations, their <br/>\nneeds, their desires, etc., a basic respect and honor of their person.<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: baby steps to radical unschooling","postDate":"1130967904","msgId":7440,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrYmMxMCtlcjk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRrYjk4YyszZnM2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7437,"nextInTopic":7450,"prevInTime":7439,"nextInTime":7441,"topicId":7437,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Say Yes more and before saying No, <br/>\nthink about Why you are about to say no. Is there a reason behind it? <br/>\nOr is it just &quot;business as usual&quot;? Sometimes there are ways to make a <br/>\nNo be a Yes - for instance &quot;Can I have 3 cookies?&quot; <br/>\nstandard answer might be &quot;NO! Just one&quot; <br/>\nnew answer might be &quot;They are good aren&#39;t they? Everyone liked them so <br/>\nmuch that there are only 3 left. Let&#39;s check and see if anyone else <br/>\nwants any before we finish them all off.&quot; And, if no one wants one, 3 <br/>\ncookies it is. <br/>\nstandard answer might be &quot;NO - no cookies before dinner&quot;<br/>\nnew answer might be &quot;we&#39;re having (name dinner food) in about 10 <br/>\nminutes (or &#39;when SpongeBob is over&#39; or &#39;when the timer beeps&#39; - <br/>\nlittle kids don&#39;t have much time sense - there&#39;s &quot;now&quot; and &quot;a long <br/>\ntime from now&quot; and that&#39;s about it). how about one cookie now so <br/>\nyou&#39;ll have room for (dinner food) which I know you like (if that&#39;s <br/>\ntrue)? you can have more later&quot; *note this one might not be a first go <br/>\nround because the kids need to have a foundation of trust that when <br/>\nyou say &#39;later&#39; it really happens later.<br/>\nstandard answer might be &quot;NO&quot; (a little kid whining) &quot;Oh okay&quot; (long <br/>\nsuffering sigh) But don&#39;t come crying to me when you&#39;ve got a tummy <br/>\nache.&quot;<br/>\nnew answer might be &quot;You know, I&#39;ve noticed that when you eat 3 <br/>\ncookies in a row, it upsets your stomach. Maybe we can put these 3 <br/>\naside just for you and you can eat them a little slowly over the <br/>\nevening.&quot; *note this too is one that requires a background of trust <br/>\nand a willingness on both parties to work toward a mutually acceptable <br/>\nsolution - child asking might decide to &quot;risk&quot; getting a stomach ache <br/>\nor might have an alternate plan to propose. lots of communication <br/>\nneeded.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure other folks have better examples but maybe this&#39;ll get you <br/>\nstarted<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":35146880,"authorName":"lreinbach","from":"&quot;lreinbach&quot; &lt;laura@...&gt;","profile":"lreinbach","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"baby steps to radical unschooling","postDate":"1130965068","msgId":7437,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrYjk4YyszZnM2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7440,"prevInTime":7436,"nextInTime":7438,"topicId":7437,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This topic of unschooling and radical unschooling and relinquishing controls has been really interesting.
