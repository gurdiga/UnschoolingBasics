I haven&#39;t been able to read for a bit and, no coincidence of course, many of the questions/issues posted are ones that I have been dealing with.<br/>\n<br/>\nLarge families:  I have been wondering too if unschooling works with large families.  5 kids, 2 adults, and lots of personalities (we each have about 3 of them - smile).  Negotiating is a skill none of us seem to have.  My husband doesn&#39;t believe in negotiating with kids - so that&#39;s an issue.  And then my children don&#39;t like negotiating either.  And there is always something to negotiate - that alone is draining.  Who watches what movie first, who closes the car door, who gets what spoon, who&#39;s story is read first, who gets to do what on the computer first, who sits in what seat, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point in time we have one computer, and one television with a vcr (only the vcr works).  We are not able to get anything else right now due to a variety of constraints.  Yet everyone wants to be &quot;first&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, when a negotiation is settled on, the next day we are back to square one.  For instance, when Safiya and Dakari both wanted to sit  next to Khidar in the car, they came up with the agreement that they would switch days - safiya one day, dakari the next.  but whenever it was safiya&#39;s day, dakari would start kicking and screaming about how he wanted to sit next to khidar.  after a few days of this I couldn&#39;t take it anymore and, yes, I decided that neither of them would sit next to khidar.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf Khalid, Safiya, and Dakari want to watch a movie when we get home there&#39;s a big to-do about who watches their movie first.  then of course tears and screaming from at least one who wanted their movie to be first.  Emotionally it&#39;s draining for me.  Most days my head feels like it&#39;s going to explode from trying to figure out and understand everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I do ask for help.  If I ask - and I really am asking at this point, I get whining and crying or I get asked &quot;do I have to&quot; every-single-time.  And my answer is &quot;no, but I could use the help.&quot;  If I&#39;m unable to help out with something there&#39;s whining and crying from Safiya and Dakari usually.  They are able to do some things for themselves, but they still want me to do it for them.  I get exhausted, I&#39;ve explained this to them, yet they want me to do all and be all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for different desires: again with the negotiating.  Clearly I need a class or two on negotiation skills because I get stuck with my kids.  I ask them to come up with solutions and then one will say &quot;no&quot; out of spite.  what to do then?  when one child just doesn&#39;t want to cooperate?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for the past 6 months or so Dakari has taken to yelling at me and his two sisters.  It makes me very angry because he only does it with me - not with my sister or his father or his grandmother - just me.  As a matter of fact, they only act this way with me period.  whenever they are with someone else and I&#39;m not around they are capable and willing.  As soon as I step into the picture they start with whining, crying, and the helplessness (safiya and dakari, not khalid and khidar).  What I am doing/not doing that is bringing this out in them?  Maybe I&#39;m exhausted as well.

Then find out what everyone <br/>\nwants to do and we discuss how everyone can have what they want.  It <br/>\nmight mean we go the park first bringing stuff to keep everyone happy <br/>\nand then stopping somewhere else on the way there or home.  Or <br/>\nfinding company to join usbringing friends along makes the world of <br/>\ndifference.  But bottom line  all of us engage in a discussion <br/>\ntowards a solution that we all are happy about.   We all make <br/>\nsuggestions.   As we&#39;ve always been together  we know how to make <br/>\nsuggestions that have potential for satisfying one another.  The <br/>\nresult may be entirely different from what I originally suggested.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s  important to listen for what is really important to each <br/>\nperson  it may be the specific park or it may be simply being <br/>\noutside or it may be a picnic or it may be continuing a specific <br/>\nactivity.   I think our success in this has come from each person <br/>\nknowing from experience that their desires are respected and so <br/>\neveryone is willing to accommodate each other.  This comes from the <br/>\nexperience of our reality.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhile I like to consider myself to be spontaneous  spontaneity <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t always work with everyone all the time.
