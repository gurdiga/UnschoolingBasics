I mean, how can you wash hair you can&#39;t comb <br/>\nor untangle?  And how do you get hair tangled/tied/mashed together like that <br/>\nwhen it&#39;s clean?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Real questions, in case the issue comes up again.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sylvia&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nStart by googling Dreadlocks.  There are TONS of websites out there with <br/>\ninformation, products, pictures etc. that explain all about dreadlocks. They <br/>\nall explain how dreadlocks are started, how they are maintained, and how to <br/>\nkeep your scalp clean.<br/>\nWhile there are people that create their dreadlocks by simply not brushing <br/>\n(they still wash) many people get dreads by going to a salon, or having a <br/>\nfriend do it. It takes about 8 hours on average to dread hair.<br/>\nGo ahead and google it, I think you&#39;ll learn alot.<br/>\n<br/>\nElissa Jill<br/>\nThe music in me is a gift from the Universe.<br/>\nMy job is to care for it and use it well; I am its bearer, not its owner.<br/>\n~Johnny Cash&#39;s Moma</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11029,"nextTopicId":11030}}
