I mostly lurk, but I have to weigh in on this, since I lived in Bar Harbor for 5 years, just moved down the coast and inland about 1 1/2 years ago.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen you&#39;re in Bar Harbor, check out the Morning Glory Bakery.  It&#39;s on Rodick Street, just off the main drag.  Just ask anyone to point you in the right direction.  They make absolutely everything from scratch (even their croissants and granola).  People who find it towards the end of their stay are always sorry they didn&#39;t find it sooner.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe Balance Rock in is right there in town in one of the old &quot;cottages&quot; from days of yore and has a spectacular view right on the sea.  You can easily stroll into town.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.balancerockinn.com/welcomebri.htm\">http://www.balancerockinn.com/welcomebri.htm</a>  The Nannau is closed for the season, but I&#39;d be remiss if I didn&#39;t mention it for future reference.

It&#39;s super-casual (island Maine-style) in an old small house, use their own organic vegetables, specialize in seafood (Elmer smokes his own salmon yummmmmmmm).  I used to wait tables there and I&#39;ve waited on Brooke Astor, random Rockefellers, and seen **Martha** who has a home nearby.  Plus all my tatooed friends.  I recommend everything.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd to keep this ON TOPIC, Back in Bar Harbor do this:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.divered.com/index.html\">http://www.divered.com/index.html</a>  Diver Ed&#39;s Dive-in Theater.
