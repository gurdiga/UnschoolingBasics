Sure hope you all don&#39;t mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about the Dobson stuff and parenting and where people are<br/>\nwhen they come to unschooling.  Our ideas and philosophies about parenting<br/>\nhave changed so much since we started this whole parenting adventure almost<br/>\n20 years ago. We are a Christian unschooling family. We were young when we<br/>\nhad our first child, we read anything and everything on parenting. Neither<br/>\nof us came from remotely healthy parenting homes and we knew we had to learn<br/>\na new way. We read a lot and I feel so fortunate that we knew even then to<br/>\nditch the Pearls kind of stuff. We settled on Dobson. It made sense at the<br/>\ntime. Coming from backgrounds with no rhyme or reason for discipline and<br/>\nparenting, it felt good to see something that had reasons and a philosophy.<br/>\nIt was also the &quot;right&quot; thing to do in the circles we were in at the time.<br/>\nAs we matured and gained experience and confidence, a lot of Dobson didn&#39;t<br/>\nseem to fit right. As we looked into our own ideas about life, our beliefs,<br/>\nour parenting, we found a lot in Dobson&#39;s stuff that felt wrong, his ideas<br/>\nwere too fundamentalist and conservative. He started going off into areas<br/>\nthat we thought we&#39;re way off base.   We then were introduced to Parenting<br/>\nwith Love and Logic, another Christian parenting book. It was better than<br/>\nDobson, more respectful (if looking at it on a continuum). It dealt with the<br/>\nneed for kids to know how to make good choices.... it made sense to us that<br/>\nkids need practice and experience in decision making and that kids need and<br/>\nhave the right to their own choices. But...a lot of the ideas were still<br/>\npunitive and disrespectful. A lot of looking for and creating adversarial<br/>\ncircumstances. Again, it began to not feel right. As we began to investigate<br/>\nunschooling, we also began to look at the reasons and ideas behind the<br/>\ndifferent parenting philosophies we were exposed to. This all was part of a<br/>\nbig process with many steps. And in reality, the process included much more<br/>\nthan just our parenting philosophies.  It included looking at our beliefs,<br/>\nour own ideas. It began to effect how we saw our kids and the relationship<br/>\nwe had and what we wanted. It included looking at our relationships with our<br/>\nfamilies and Friends.  I&#39;m writing this because I remember Dobson and<br/>\nthe others making sense. I remember thinking that had to the right way to do<br/>\nthings. I remember the fear that if we didn&#39;t follow their &quot;recipe&quot; we would<br/>\nhave horrible kids. Even though they are not at all what I would recommend<br/>\nnow, they were important stepping stones in getting from where we were to<br/>\nwhere we are now. Not everyone takes the slow route like we did, and not<br/>\neveryone needs all the steps, but for us, these ideas bridged where we were<br/>\nto where we are now. Sometimes I wished we could have started out being AP<br/>\nparents, understanding respectful parenting ideas and  not needing the whole<br/>\nprocess. It wasn&#39;t fair to Kate especially, our first born. But she<br/>\nsurvived, we&#39;ve talked about where we were and why and apologized where<br/>\nneeded. We did the absolute best we could given where we were and what<br/>\nwe knew at the time and I can accept that. But, how much better to not have<br/>\nstarted off there. And I am so thankful for people willing to challenge my<br/>\nideas. And I&#39;m glad Chuck and I were willing to question things and not<br/>\naccept ideas &#39;just because&#39;. Being willing to be wrong, being willing to<br/>\nlook at what and why we believe about most anything, and being willing to<br/>\nchange......those matter far more than what one believes at any given<br/>\nmoment.   This kind of looking and challenging didn&#39;t change our core<br/>\nreligious beliefs (something that can happen, but didn&#39;t for us) but we do<br/>\nthink that a lot of &#39;truth&#39; that is taught is cultural and not based on real<br/>\nknowledge. We needed to find out for ourselves what things meant and how<br/>\nthey applied to our family.  Our process was long, in part because we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have anyone along side us to challenge us, encourage us or support<br/>\nus. I hope that sharing our process here and other places can help others<br/>\nnavigate this process more quickly than we were able to do so.  Or at least<br/>\ngive people something to think about. And hopefully, my pain medication<br/>\nhasn&#39;t made this totally incoherent and off base!<br/>\n<br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-19, Lisa-16, Karl-14, & Ben-10.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingonashoestring.com/REACH_home.html\">http://www.homeschoolingonashoestring.com/REACH_home.html</a><br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art www.artkunst23.com<br/>\n&quot;All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.&quot;<br/>\n  Gandalf the Grey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 1/20/06, Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;If you click on the &quot;Send email&quot; that occurs at the top of this<br/>\n&gt; message (toward the right of the Subject line), you can send me a<br/>\n&gt; private email message and we can go from there.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I completely and totally understand the need for private<br/>\n&gt; conversations...but if you guys discuss things you think might help<br/>\n&gt; other people, feel free to bring it here too.:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt; learninginfreedom.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Dr. Dobson","postDate":"1137780107","msgId":9353,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRxcjhpYis5MGozQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRxcjcyZytwYnF1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9348,"nextInTopic":9359,"prevInTime":9352,"nextInTime":9354,"topicId":9283,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I am not trying to cause a major<br/>\n&gt; discussion about Christianity, but I did not read anything before<br/>\n&gt; joining about this being anti-Christian.  Yes, Dr. Dobson does<br/>\n&gt; support spanking, etc., but the Bible tells us to &quot;Train up a<br/>\n&gt; child in the way he should go...&quot;.  I feel we have a responsibility<br/>\n&gt; to guide our children in helping them to make sound decisions<br/>\n&gt; in certain areas of their lives.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think I understood Susan&#39;s question regarding TV.

HITTING IS ACTUALLY NOT BIBLICAL<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t use the Bible as an excuse to spank. There is confusion in  <br/>\n&gt; the ranks of people of Judeo-Christian heritage who, seeking help  <br/>\n&gt; from the Bible in their effort to raise godly children, believe  <br/>\n&gt; that God commands them to spank. They take &quot;spare the rod and spoil  <br/>\n&gt; the child&quot; seriously and fear that if they don&#39;t spank, they will  <br/>\n&gt; commit the sin of losing control of their child. In our counseling  <br/>\n&gt; experience, we find that these people are devoted parents who love  <br/>\n&gt; God and love their children, but they misunderstand the concept of  <br/>\n&gt; the rod.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rod verses - what they really mean. The following are the biblical  <br/>\n&gt; verseswhich have caused the greatest confusion:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of  <br/>\n&gt; discipline will drive it far from him.&quot; (Prov. 22:15)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is  <br/>\n&gt; careful to discipline him.&quot; (Prov. 13:24)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish him with  <br/>\n&gt; the rod, he will not die. Punish him with the rod and save his soul  <br/>\n&gt; from death.&quot; (Prov. 23:13-14)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to itself  <br/>\n&gt; disgraces his mother.&quot; (Prov. 29:15)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At first glance these verses may sound pro-spanking. But you might  <br/>\n&gt; consider a different interpretation of these teachings.  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Rod&quot; (shebet) means different things in different parts of the  <br/>\n&gt; Bible. The Hebrew dictionary gives this word various meanings: a  <br/>\n&gt; stick (for punishment, writing, fighting, ruling, walking, etc.).  <br/>\n&gt; While the rod could be used for hitting, it was more frequently  <br/>\n&gt; used for guiding wandering sheep. Shepherds didn&#39;t use the rod to  <br/>\n&gt; beat their sheep - and children are certainly more valuable than  <br/>\n&gt; sheep. As shepherd-author Philip Keller teaches so well in A  <br/>\n&gt; Shepherd Looks At Psalm 23, the shepherd&#39;s rod was used to fight  <br/>\n&gt; off prey and the staff was used to gently guide sheep along the  <br/>\n&gt; right path. (&quot;Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.&quot; � Psalm  <br/>\n&gt; 23:4).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jewish families we&#39;ve interviewed, who carefully follow dietary and  <br/>\n&gt; lifestyle guidelines in the Scripture, do not practice &quot;rod  <br/>\n&gt; correction&quot; with their children because they do not follow that  <br/>\n&gt; interpretation of the text.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The book of Proverbs is one of poetry. It is logical that the  <br/>\n&gt; writer would have used a well-known tool to form an image of  <br/>\n&gt; authority. We believe that this is the point that God makes about  <br/>\n&gt; the rod in the Bible � parents take charge of your children. When  <br/>\n&gt; you re-read the &quot;rod verses,&quot; use the concept of parental authority  <br/>\n&gt; when you come to the word &quot;rod,&quot; ratherthan the concept of beating  <br/>\n&gt; or spanking. It rings true in every instance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While Christians and Jews believe that the Old Testament is the  <br/>\n&gt; inspired word of God, it is also a historical text that has been  <br/>\n&gt; interpreted in many ways over the centuries, sometimes incorrectly  <br/>\n&gt; in order to support the beliefs of the times. These &quot;rod&quot; verses  <br/>\n&gt; have been burdened with interpretations about corporal punishment  <br/>\n&gt; that support human ideas. Other parts of the Bible, especially the  <br/>\n&gt; New Testament, suggest that respect, authority, and tenderness  <br/>\n&gt; should be the prevailing attitudes toward children among people of  <br/>\n&gt; faith.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the New Testament, Christ modified the traditional eye-for-an- <br/>\n&gt; eye system of justice with His turn-the-other-cheek approach.  <br/>\n&gt; Christ preached gentleness, love, and understanding, and seemed  <br/>\n&gt; against any harsh use of the rod, as stated by Paul in 1 Cor. 4:21:  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Shall I come to you with the whip (rod), or in love and with a  <br/>\n&gt; gentle spirit?&quot; Paul went on to teach fathers about the importance  <br/>\n&gt; of not provoking anger in their children (which is what spanking  <br/>\n&gt; usually does): &quot;Fathers, do not exasperate your children&quot; (Eph.  <br/>\n&gt; 6:4), and &quot;Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will be  <br/>\n&gt; discouraged&quot; (Col. 3:21).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227139139,"authorName":"elizabeth roberts","from":"elizabeth roberts &lt;joyfullzoo@...&gt;","profile":"joyfullzoo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Dr. Dobson","postDate":"1137696717","msgId":9292,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTE5MTg1MTU3LjU4NDIxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMDA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRxb2s5cStrMTRsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9289,"nextInTopic":9296,"prevInTime":9291,"nextInTime":9293,"topicId":9283,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Shari, I wouldn t necessarily say Anti-Christian.

Yes, Dr. Dobson does<br/>\nsupport spanking, etc., but the Bible tells us to &quot;Train up a<br/>\nchild in the way he should go...&quot;.  I feel we have a responsibility<br/>\nto guide our children in helping them to make sound decisions<br/>\nin certain areas of their lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I understood Susan&#39;s question regarding TV.  This has been<br/>\nmy main concern about beginning unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust wondering about these things...thinking, thinking, thinking...<br/>\n<br/>\nShari</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9057,"nextTopicId":9392}}
