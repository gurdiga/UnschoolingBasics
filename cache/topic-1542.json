But different isn&#39;t wrong. A child<br/>\nmight think it&#39;s ridiculous to put away toys when it&#39;s much easier to use<br/>\nthem when they&#39;re out to be seen. An adult might think it&#39;s dangerous to<br/>\nleave them out because people could trip over them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the child wrong? Is the adult right? No. Both are right from their own<br/>\npoint of view. What&#39;s wrong is when the adult determines the child&#39;s point<br/>\nof view is wrong and the adult point of view needs to prevail.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat adults then end up modeling as a problem solving technique -- and it<br/>\nmust be a *good* technique since adults use it *a lot* -- is that the way to<br/>\nresolve conflicts of interest is to be big and strong and make a weaker<br/>\nperson do it your way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we see kids solving problems that way, we get concerned that they&#39;re<br/>\nbecoming bullies. But we don&#39;t see that they learn that technique from us!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems to me that my children would rather do anything rather than pick up<br/>\n&gt; after themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Me too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what you&#39;re really saying is that kids generate a lot of mess and that<br/>\nyou resent them for &quot;making&quot; you clean up after them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they *aren&#39;t* making you clean up. You&#39;re *choosing* to keep the house<br/>\nat a standard that makes you comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So if it hadn&#39;t been the dog it would have been the t.v.<br/>\n&gt; or the computer or ... whatever.  Does that mean that I should expect to do<br/>\n&gt; anything myself that they don&#39;t feel like doing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes and no. If you go into it with the attitude that they get to play while<br/>\nyou get to do all the work, you&#39;re going to resent them.<br/>\n<br/>\nChange will come when you can see with a new attitude or new point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect right now that you approach their helping as something you expect<br/>\nand then you send out negative emotions when they don&#39;t. So they&#39;re stuck<br/>\nbetween a rock and a hard place.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if a friend volunteered cleaning up a park. What if she assumed since<br/>\nyou live in the town too that you had a duty to clean too. So when she asked<br/>\nyou to help, she wasn&#39;t really asking because no wasn&#39;t an acceptable answer<br/>\nto her. She was &quot;politely&quot; telling you to get down to the park and help. But<br/>\nwhen you did show up to help, her attitude was basically &quot;Here&#39;s the jobs<br/>\nthat need done.&quot; And when you were done, her response was essentially<br/>\n&quot;Thanks. You can go now.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what if another friend called and said she was in a bind. She said her<br/>\nhelpers hadn&#39;t shown up and she was desperately in need of help to clean up<br/>\nthe park before the afternoon concert. And what if she said she totally<br/>\nunderstood that you had more important things to do but that she wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nask if she wasn&#39;t in great need. And then when you showed up you could feel<br/>\nand hear she was very greatful. And afterwards what if she offered to take<br/>\nyou to lunch or take the kids for the day to show her appreciation?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich friend would you be more likely to help? Which friend would you likely<br/>\ndo the barest minimum for so you could escape? Which friend would you likely<br/>\npull the curtains on if you saw coming up the walk?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we appraoch chores with the attitude that it&#39;s kids duty to help and<br/>\ngive them grudging thanks for doing what they&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to do and flak<br/>\nif they don&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t encourage them to help. It encourages them to<br/>\navoid us and anything that looks like work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we take full responsibility for all chores in the house and *ask* for<br/>\nhelp -- knowing they can say no -- and assume they&#39;re doing their best even<br/>\nif it isn&#39;t as much as we would like and truly appreciate them taking time<br/>\nfrom more interesting things to do us a favor, then we can be people they<br/>\nwant to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf parents have been authoritarian it takes a while for kids to catch onto<br/>\nthe new attitude. They&#39;ll still hear authoritarian even when we don&#39;t mean<br/>\nit. They&#39;ll still hear questions as demands even if we intend for them to be<br/>\ntrue questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will help if you invite kids to do fun things with you that will help. Or<br/>\nto just spend time with you to keep you company. You can ask them to do a<br/>\nlittle thing to help out, like something that needs three hands. And<br/>\nappreciate their help. And their company :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t really an easy answer. It&#39;s emotianally draining being<br/>\nauthoritarian, getting everyone to do what they&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to do. But it<br/>\nis straightforward to explain to others. If you want your kids to do x, then<br/>\nyou do y.<br/>\n<br/>\nGentle parenting is something else. It isn&#39;t about getting them to do what<br/>\nyou want. It&#39;s about living together peacefully. Part of living peacefully<br/>\nis wanting to be together and help each other. But there isn&#39;t a way to<br/>\n*make* kids do that. It comes from projecting an attitude of appreciation<br/>\nfor them being in your life. And if they feel that, they&#39;ll want to return<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Gentler way of talking to your kids","postDate":"1089368188","msgId":1646,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEMTNFOEJDLjI4RTQ3JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzYzkwMWM0NjU1NiQyMTA2YzBhMCQ2NTAwYThjMEBMYXB0b3A+"},"prevInTopic":1643,"nextInTopic":1647,"prevInTime":1645,"nextInTime":1647,"topicId":1542,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Some<br/>\nof these are horrendous, and even life threatening. Some people still<br/>\nunschooling, have even lost a child. I bet they wish they had that &quot;drag&quot; on<br/>\ntheir time.

So if it hadn&#39;t been the dog it would have been the<br/>\nt.v. or the computer or ... whatever.  Does that mean that I should expect<br/>\nto do anything myself that they don&#39;t feel like doing?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest I also would rather do just about anything fun than pick up<br/>\nafter myself. It sounds like a sane and sensible ordering of personal<br/>\npriorities. What I do to avoid housework is get on line. ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, kidding aside, at our house the answer to that question is really<br/>\nsimply &quot;yes&quot;, if it is important to *you*. I guess what you might ask<br/>\nyourself is whether you are trying to &quot;teach&quot; her some kind of lesson by<br/>\nforcing responsibility on her. Most people here recommend modeling and<br/>\nkindness instead. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;What I hadn&#39;t mentioned in my original post was that as we approached the<br/>\nhouse I reminded both children that Mr. B had cleaned the car very nicely<br/>\nand I&#39;d like to keep it that way so please bring all of your stuff in the<br/>\nhouse with you. Miss T couldn&#39;t carry it all so I reminded her that she<br/>\ncould do it in more than one trip if she wants. She brought in one load,<br/>\nwent to the bathroom and then started playing with the dog leaving the bulk<br/>\nof her belongings in the car.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would urge you to look at this way of speaking again. It sounds like you<br/>\nwere trying to &quot;guilt&quot; and manipulate your kids. They are not very likely to<br/>\nlook at Mr. B&#39;s efforts very cordially or with gratitude if the result is<br/>\nthat you use them as a reason that they then have to do stuff they don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to. I wonder why she couldn&#39;t go get &quot;her belongings&quot; when she needed<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;So the problem that I have with speaking to them as I would speak to<br/>\nadults is that adults don&#39;t just capriciously say &quot;No&quot; and leave you with<br/>\nall the work (or at least the adults I know usually don&#39;t.)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience has been that it is more *not* saying things that you would<br/>\nnot say to an adult because those things are disrespectful in that context,<br/>\nso they are just as disrespectful of the child. Also if an adult said, &quot;I<br/>\ncan&#39;t help you with that right now, because I&#39;m doing something&quot; wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nyou respect that? Would you assume they were being capricious, or maybe<br/>\ngenuinely tired/distracted/in need of a break and intending to do it later,<br/>\nunless they forgot. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might enjoy reading some of the things at  www.sandradodd.com  <br/>\nShe has a section about chores.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

That sounds different from what I mean <br/>\nthough.  lol!  Instead of &quot;would you please go get me a diaper?&quot; you <br/>\nsay &quot;get mom a diaper&quot; or &quot;get mom a diaper please&quot;.  This is based <br/>\non *The Continuum Concept* of parenting.  Here is a link to an <br/>\narticle that you might find interesting.  I sure did.  :)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.continuum-concept.org/reading/restoringHarmony.html\">http://www.continuum-concept.org/reading/restoringHarmony.html</a> <br/>\nRestoring Harmony: A Mother&#39;s Story <br/>\nby Abigail Warren <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a quote from the article:<br/>\n&quot;Jean proceeded to describe all the common mistakes made by parents <br/>\nwho are genuinely trying to do everything right (holding our babies, <br/>\nnursing, sleeping with them). Terrified of doing anything wrong, and <br/>\ntrying so hard to save our children from all the agony we suffered as <br/>\nchildren, we go overboard in the other direction (what Jean refers to <br/>\nas &quot;child-centered&quot;). We try too hard to please, and too hard not to <br/>\nantagonize. We are over-attentive and self-sacrificing (how did Jean <br/>\nknow me so well?). We look guilty and anxious as we plead with our <br/>\nchildren, ask permission of them, and continuously reason, explain, <br/>\nand apologize. All of this puts the child in control, and since what <br/>\nthe child innately wants and needs is not to be in control, and to <br/>\nhave a mother who is in control, it makes the child insecure and <br/>\neventually angry. <br/>\n&quot;The child needs a mother who is confident and calm,&quot; Jean <br/>\nexplained. &quot;A mother who knows what to do, and doesn&#39;t ask permission <br/>\nfrom her child. It may look the opposite  that the child is <br/>\nstruggling for more control, but ironically she is struggling not to <br/>\nbe in control and is pushing you until you stand firm. When a child <br/>\nfeels that she might gain control, her impulse is to push for it. She <br/>\ncannot resist this, as it is human nature and is exactly what she is <br/>\nprogrammed to do. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t plead with her over anything,&quot; Jean went on. &quot;If you&#39;re <br/>\npleading with her, then she&#39;s got the power, and it makes her nervous <br/>\nbecause it means you&#39;re not sure of yourself, and you&#39;re begging her <br/>\nfor acceptance. Any grown-up lady that pleads with a four year old is <br/>\nnot to be relied on. Do not ask her what she wants to do, tell her, <br/>\nbut be sure you don&#39;t do it in an angry way. Just be matter of fact <br/>\nand nicely say what you want her to do. Treat her as your ally, <br/>\nexpecting that she wants to know, expecting that she will listen. And <br/>\nyou don&#39;t give her endless reasons; that tends again to sound like <br/>\npleading. <br/>\n&quot;Even when you hug your child, see if you&#39;re in any way asking for <br/>\nforgiveness  pleading with the child in some way.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH!  :)<br/>\n~Amanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jeanne Goodman&quot; <br/>\n&lt;goodmanj@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ok, my head is spinning from conflicting advice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When my boy was born, my parenting style was to try to speak to my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>kids as I would an adult.
