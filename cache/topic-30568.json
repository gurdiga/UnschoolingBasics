I know many of you are on both lists I&#39;m<br/>\nsending this to, but I&#39;m hoping someone will be able to direct me.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend with a son who has Tourette Syndrome. His son has had to<br/>\nendure abuse and mistreatment from both students and teachers at school. My<br/>\nfriend is seriously considering taking his son out of school and<br/>\nhomeschooling him. When I spoke with my friend about this, and about<br/>\nunschooling specifically, he said it was the first thing that sounded<br/>\nhopeful to him. He asked if there were families who were unschooling with<br/>\nchildren with Tourette&#39;s. I seem to remember people posting about this. If<br/>\nyou are unschooling, and have a child with Tourette&#39;s, would you be willing<br/>\nto contact me off-list? I&#39;d like to help my friend in any way I can, but I<br/>\nhave no direct experience with this particular set of circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30567,"nextTopicId":30350}}
