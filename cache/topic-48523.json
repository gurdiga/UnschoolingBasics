When people are busily, actively using a space, tidiness is secondary. There&#39;s a great line, somewhere in the Blog of the Zombie Princess which goes something like this: we&#39;re homeschoolers, we live here, we&#39;re home a lot, You Can Tell. Think of people you know who have cluttered desks and messy workshops - unschooling homes are the offices and workshops of our kids, and you can tell. The evidence of their busy, engaged lives is all around. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it helps to remember that, to look around at mess and clutter and see instead a kind of visual record. A plate and cup means someone remembered to eat - great! A crumpled pair of pants tells you someone put clean clothes on today - hooray! A sea of legos speaks of construction projects, dramatic play, problem solving, maybe some cooperation, too. A swath of paper scraps is evidence of some fantastic artistic endeavor. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t find that Zombie Princess quote, but here&#39;s a nice post on the subject of housework and shifting perspectives. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://zombieprincess.blogspot.com/2008/12/house-work.html\">http://zombieprincess.blogspot.com/2008/12/house-work.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":509159156,"authorName":"Marie Tindall","from":"Marie Tindall &lt;chocalady@...&gt;","profile":"mcryckman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Housework","postDate":"1338037770","msgId":48545,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFNOVDEzOS1XNTEwOUUyM0M0QzQ1N0Y0QzE3NEI0RkI5MDYwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PENCRTYyMTQxLkEzMEIlamVueW91c3RAbWkucnIuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PENCRTYyMTQxLkEzMEIlamVueW91c3RAbWkucnIuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48544,"nextInTopic":48546,"prevInTime":48544,"nextInTime":48546,"topicId":48523,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I swap with a friend usually 3-4 hours/ once/month kind of thing to deal with the pile ups and get everything manageable again.

Strategies that make cute ideas for younger children don&#39;t tend to last well into adolescence - in fact, it&#39;s generally more helpful to step away from wanting to have A good solution or system and instead look for collections of ideas and tools to try in a range of different situations. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of this reply is a bit of a tangent from the original topic, and some of the quotes are internal quotes - the poster quoting another source. Please note that &quot;you&quot; is used in the general sense, not the specific.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &quot;First, I drew a simple rainbow on our chalkboard. I then asked the girls<br/>\n&gt; helped me brainstorm the different activities we generally do at different<br/>\n&gt; times of the day.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Learning happens amazingly well without a need to create lessons. The rainbow thing is cute, but it&#39;s still pretty clearly a lesson - and a lot of kids will catch on to that one way or another, either because they&#39;ve dealt with school or home-ed and have learned to smell a rat, or because their personalities don&#39;t lend well to this kind of contrived interaction. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is 10, and has been unschooled from the start, so she doesn&#39;t have an automatic aversion to &quot;lessons&quot; but she would imediately catch on that there wasn&#39;t any real &quot;brainstorming&quot; to be done - it&#39;s a quiz, and a purely dismissive one at that. When she wants to keep track of what she&#39;s doing on a given day, she checks her calender, otherwise, what does it matter? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;What comes<br/>\n&gt; first, dressing ourselves or playing outside?  Grocery shopping or cooking<br/>\n&gt; dinner?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This sounds like its right out of a teacher training manual: lesson 15: sequencing. But in real life, getting dressed doesn&#39;t necessarily come before playing outside - if anything, my kids tend to change clothes when they come in muddy or sweaty or drenched... for that matter, so do I! And why would I go grocery shopping before making dinner? did I forget something at the store? Can I not substitute? I&#39;m being a little silly here to make a point - it&#39;s not a real conversation, it&#39;s a lesson with right and wrong answers. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn real life, converstaions about first-next-later happen naturally, in regards to alllllll sorts of things. I want to run out to the store but first I need to find my keys and then I need to stop for gas, and then the bank - that&#39;s normal planning, and if you do it out loud and up-front so your kids know what&#39;s going on, they learn pretty handily about sequencing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;Simple questions and yet I could see that it gave them such<br/>\n&gt; confidence to actually spend thought on their daily activities and<br/>\n&gt; interactions.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re open to making those sorts of conversations real conversations, they&#39;re an opportunity for kids to say &quot;since we&#39;re out, I&#39;d like to do something&quot; and you to work out a plan to include what they want in your plans - and That goes a long way toward helping them have a sense of confidence in their doings; they have real power in their world. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;The rainbow is not a set of structured agendas though!  It is a set of<br/>\n&gt; principles and offers ideas on how to make our time flow more smoothly.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re coming from a highly regulated background, it might not seem like the rainbow thing is about a structured agenda, but it&#39;s really loaded up with adult agendas about &quot;self regulation&quot;. Self regulation is a good idea to pick apart in and of itself, but I&#39;ll skip that for now and say it&#39;s not Necessary to self regulate as long as you feel like you have options and can make choices. When kids are stuck in a situation where they Don&#39;t feel like they can make real, meaningful choices, then &quot;self regulation&quot; becomes important. When you set your kids up to make choices, they learn that life is full of choices - it is!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot; For instance, if the girls seem rowdy I ask them &quot;Where are we in our<br/>\n&gt; Rhythm right now?  Where would you like to be?&quot;  As we tend to stay awake<br/>\n&gt; later than daddy, it&#39;s nice to be able to kindly remind them that we are<br/>\n&gt; &quot;in the blue&quot;.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why not remind them that someone they love would like to sleep? Or suggest, if they&#39;re in a rowdy mood, that y&#39;all get out of the house for a little while and blow off some steam? Or if the rest of the family is regularly up later than dad, is it possible to create some sound-deadening strategies by re-arranging the house layout, getting a white-noise machine (or a fish-tank), adding draperies and plants? Rather than looking for ways to teach self-regulation, see that life is full of opportunites for kids to make choices. Help them make better choices. If a cutesie image helps you communicate about choices, then it&#39;s not a bad thing, but keep in mind that it&#39;s not going to last very long. A ten year old isn&#39;t going to have much patience for &quot;where are we on our rainbow?&quot; she&#39;s going to roll her eyes and wish you&#39;d just get to the point. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If the rhythm of my day leads me to a chore, I will let the kids know that<br/>\n&gt; it is how I feel.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow, that&#39;s convoluted reasoning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen reasoning seems really convoluted, it can help to touch base with one&#39;s most cherished values. So, if I value kindness, sometimes it&#39;s a kinder choice to clean the kitchen right now - and sometimes it&#39;s kinder to spend time with one of my kids or my partner, or sit out on the porch and take a few deep breaths. It&#39;s not clear to me what kind of values are being expressed by saying &quot;the rhythm... leads me to a chore&quot;. Responsibility?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;They may be asked to help...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is it a real question, where No is an acceptible answer? No matter what they&#39;re doing? It&#39;s not a bad thing to occasionally say &quot;give me a hand with this&quot; - adults ask each other for help, after all. But demanding in the form of a question sets kids up to mistrust adult questions - plus it&#39;s rude! If you value courtesy and kindness, be kind and courteous to your children. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;or at least be expected to let<br/>\n&gt; me complete the task while they busy themselves elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not always feasible - kids need parents! Some kids need more time and energy from parents than others, and they don&#39;t all express that in big, obvious ways. Expecting kids to stay out of your way and let you finish can set some kids up to clamor, and set others up to feel disregarded: I&#39;m less important than the dishes. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of a rhythm is a good one in that it&#39;s natural for people to have rhythms - and it&#39;s good to notice what your kids rhythms are, so you can work little bits of housekeeping into the day or big bits of housekeeping into the week. It&#39;s better to think of it that way - do those tasks which take you away from your kids when they Are busy elsewhere, naturally focused on what&#39;s interesting to them. And even then be sure you&#39;re taking time to see what&#39;s fun and new and exciting to your kids. You don&#39;t get those moments back.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":262318461,"authorName":"Sara Evans","from":"Sara Evans &lt;sunrayemomi@...&gt;","profile":"sunrayemomi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Housework","postDate":"1337534328","msgId":48531,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBK2FrTlJpUlRvTUtWeXBzSExqMVNrUGM2dE1WNV9kQnJDPUFhTC1idy1tQXE0azZjQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpwNjl2cCs0aDQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpwNjl2cCs0aDQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48530,"nextInTopic":48532,"prevInTime":48530,"nextInTime":48532,"topicId":48523,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

For instance, I prefer to have less dishes to wash so they don&#39;t pile up, but my partner is the at-home parent and he prefers to have lots and lots of dishes so he can put off washing them longer. We&#39;re the opposite with laundry, though - I&#39;d rather do all the laundry one or two days a week, while he&#39;d rather do it a little at a time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can help to re-prioritize, too. How much really Needs to be picked up? Can you live with a little more clutter? What kind of mess is there? Can you put a laundry basket in the living room and toss discarded socks and towels there as you come across them and take all that to the laundry later? Maybe a washtub for random dishes, too. How about big bins to toss toys into so you can do a sort of cursory clean-up without actually putting anything &quot;away&quot;. For legos and small toys, I learned to clean with a dust-pan: scoop it all into a bin, and it&#39;s done. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can also help to re-think when you do the cleaning and include the kids a little. For instance, it&#39;s easier for some kids to see the point of cleaning up when it&#39;s to make room for something they want to do: help me get these dishes in the sink and this puzzle put away so we can use the table to paint. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Housework","postDate":"1337458471","msgId":48527,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpwOHV2NytzNzhyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpwNjl2cCs0aDQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48523,"nextInTopic":48529,"prevInTime":48526,"nextInTime":48528,"topicId":48523,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The dishes will still be there.

This is my least favorite thing but shouldn&#39;t take more than 10 minutes and you&#39;re in the kitchen anyway. Do it and get it done. Now, make sure the beef stew is simmering nicely in the crock pot and return to playing with the kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nGreat! Now, the dishes got done too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there was still lots of playing. The playing is the important stuff. The laundry and dishes are the boring stuff that gets done as you can, in between living.
