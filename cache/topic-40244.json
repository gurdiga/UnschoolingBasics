You may need to transition from a &quot;daycare&quot; if those rules hold you back. You may need to rethink about those rules. Pick one and figure out what it really requires at a minimum and whether you want to live with that. Then figure out how you can comply with the rule and live as you like and treat the children the way you would like to treat your child. Etc. It would take some step-by-step work, approaching each decision from a new perspective. But this is about figuring out how you want to live. How you want your child to live. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not at all the same thing, but I run a private school. It is for unschoolers and other hsers in my state. There are some regulations that I have to comply with. But these do not at all impact the families or my own family in the way we live as unschoolers. I fill out the forms and count the heads and collect paperwork and it is all completely meaningless and disconnected from our actual lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I could be very schoolish in the way I run my school. Beyond the minimum the law requires from the families (attendance and enrollment paperwork), the school owner can require the students and their families to do all sorts of things. If I had it in my head that everyone needed to send me a report on their activities, or read a certain curriculum, or meet once a month, or whatever, I could require that. Many schools do require these things. But they are not required by law. Of course, many people want that additional interaction and/or oversight. Some parents new to my school have a hard time not reporting additional information to me. But the law does not require more than X and I don&#39;t require more than X. (It&#39;s not a &quot;homeschool freedom&quot; or any other sort of battle for me -- it&#39;s just how I live.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAll to say that complying with regulations does not always have to determine the actual content of your life.
