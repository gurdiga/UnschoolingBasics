You tell me how it is for you, I tell you how it is for <br/>\n&gt; me, we share ideas, compare notes and leave the elitism and <br/>\n&gt; judgment out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I just had a revelation. Many people have said over the years that <br/>\nthey want a list where everyone shares what they do and no one is <br/>\njudged. Obviously it&#39;s a need being unmet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with creating such a list is that, after an initial <br/>\nflurry, people won&#39;t write! I&#39;ve seen it happen over and over from <br/>\nlists that branched off from UnschoolingDiscussion when people wanted <br/>\nto create that kind of list. It *sounds* like a great idea. It sounds <br/>\nlike meeting regularly with friends to just share and swap stories. <br/>\nCool!<br/>\n<br/>\n(And if you *do* have a viable list please post it! So people can get <br/>\nthat need met! *No one* wants people to stay on the list because they <br/>\nthink this is the only option beginners have. Regular contributors <br/>\n*do* want people to &quot;get&quot; unschooling because we think it&#39;s a great <br/>\nidea! We would like people to be able to find a resource that works <br/>\nfor them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen was the last time you wrote a letter to a friend just telling <br/>\nabout the things going on in your life? Could you do that several <br/>\ntimes a week?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that when we invest time in something, we need to <br/>\nreceive something of equal value in return. This is true of anything <br/>\nwe invest time in in our lives. The return might be a feeling of <br/>\nsatisfaction. It might be feeling good about having helped someone. <br/>\nIt might be information. It might be sharing time with friends. It <br/>\nmight be accomplishing a task. It might be ... whatever floats your <br/>\nboat :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with the type of list many people have said they want is <br/>\nthat it doesn&#39;t return as much as it takes *from the writers*. For <br/>\npeople to spend time writing -- so there&#39;s something for others to <br/>\nread! --, the writers must have a need that gets fulfilled *by <br/>\nwriting*. The need can&#39;t be fulfilled just from reading. If that need <br/>\ncan be met just by reading, when they&#39;re done reading their internal <br/>\nprioritizer starts sending out red alerts about things that would be <br/>\noffering better returns for the time invested. ;-) &quot;Laundry ... Take <br/>\nkids to park ... Read a book ... Watch TV ... Go pick up furnace <br/>\nfilters ...&quot; (And if you don&#39;t have a pile of other things you could <br/>\nbe doing then you&#39;re probably not a mom and probably not an <br/>\nunschooler! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI spend a lot of time writing. I *could* spend that time reading, or <br/>\ndrawing, or cleaning, or exercising, or sleeping. (I get up very <br/>\nearly to avoid stealing family time.) I *choose* to spend that time <br/>\nwriting because I get something valuable back from it. I love <br/>\nwriting. I love crafting words. I love trying to make complex things <br/>\nsimple. I could spend the time writing for magazines and get <br/>\npaid! :-) But I choose to write answers for posts because the return <br/>\nI get is a sense that my thinking is getting clearer and I don&#39;t get <br/>\nthat same satisfaction from other things or even other types of <br/>\nwriting. I don&#39;t know why others write. But whatever they&#39;re getting <br/>\nback, it&#39;s something that&#39;s important enough to set aside time for.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a great idea to think of people trading stories about what&#39;s <br/>\ngoing on in their lives, but it takes time to write up stories. And <br/>\nthe people writing the stories need to get something back for the <br/>\ntime it takes to write that they can&#39;t get if they don&#39;t write.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what people are wanting in a list is a coffee klatch, a get- <br/>\ntogether with people of like mind to swap bits of their lives. Sounds <br/>\ncool. In real life people can get together to swap bits of their <br/>\nlives because they have some connection with each other. The point <br/>\nisn&#39;t the stories, the point is sharing with friends or others you <br/>\nshare a bond with. But people can&#39;t just jump onto a list and find <br/>\nthat, unfortunately. It&#39;s going to be a rare confluence of people who <br/>\nall click and all feel a passion for writing about their lives to the <br/>\npoint where they&#39;re willing to set aside an hour or more of their <br/>\nlives several times a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian started a really cool list a couple of years ago. It&#39;s <br/>\ncalled UnschoolingStories. It&#39;s just, as it says in the description, <br/>\n&quot;stories of how unschooling works. We&#39;ll learn from each other by <br/>\nsharing experiences and observations. It is not a discussion list, <br/>\nnot a debate list, and not really even a &quot;support&quot; or &quot;advice&quot; list.&quot; <br/>\nCool! And yet there were a total of 5 posts last year. Not because <br/>\nthe idea is bad. It&#39;s a great idea. It&#39;s that there isn&#39;t enough <br/>\nreturn for the time invested in writing. In fact there isn&#39;t enough <br/>\nreturn to even forward a post written for another list. (If there <br/>\nwere, people would do it!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason discussion lists like UnschoolingDiscussion and <br/>\nUnschoolingBasics (and I assume AlwaysUnschooled) is that the writers <br/>\nare getting back something they feel is valuable to them for the time <br/>\nthey invest in writing. Part is they&#39;re helping build something they <br/>\npassionately believe in. The other part is undoubtedly personal to <br/>\neach person. People *will* find it a valuable use of time writing <br/>\nabout their problems. People *will* find it a valuable use of time to <br/>\nanswer when they feel their answer is helping to build something <br/>\nthey&#39;re passionate about.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who want the coffee klatch type of list you need to create <br/>\nsomething that people *need* to write for. Not just read! Not just <br/>\nwant to write for! *Need* to write for. Something they&#39;re willing to <br/>\nset an hour or so of their life aside to contribute to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd has sort of a coffee klatch list: AlwaysLearning, for <br/>\nthose who already get unschooling to just talk about their lives. A <br/>\nfair number of the posts are similar to UnschoolingDiscussion: people <br/>\nbringing in problems they&#39;re having getting unschooling. If you take <br/>\naway those there wouldn&#39;t be many posts left. The rest is mostly <br/>\nSandra and occasionally others offering &quot;Here&#39;s something that&#39;s <br/>\ncool.&quot; It might be a slice of life or philosophy or idea or website <br/>\nand some discussion afterwards. But it works not because it&#39;s a <br/>\ncoffee klatch but because the people there like Sandra and the <br/>\natmosphere she can create. They come for that. If they don&#39;t like <br/>\nSandra or the atmosphere they shouldn&#39;t come! The list works not <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s a trading of ideas but because of Sandra.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey say if you build it, they will come ;-) But it takes more than <br/>\njust creating a list to build something that people want to come to. <br/>\nIt needs to provide something people want to read. That part might <br/>\ncome from a strong personality who just likes to write that people <br/>\nenjoy reading :-) (Blogs!) It needs to provide something people want <br/>\nto write for. And that&#39;s harder.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a list like that could work if there were a strong <br/>\npersonality behind a list (or message board) like that. Someone who <br/>\nfelt passionate enough about it to write even when no one was <br/>\nresponding. Creating something that others would not only love to <br/>\nread but love to contribute to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it could work *maybe* if there were a weekly topic. Maybe <br/>\npeople would overcome the downsides of a mish mosh of philosophies if <br/>\nthere were a specific topic to write about. But again I think it <br/>\nwould take someone with a passion about the project and a strong <br/>\npersonality to drum up interest to keep it going. That&#39;s just a guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list works because of the passion of Ren and Kelly and the <br/>\npassion of the people willing to set aside time to write for <br/>\nsomething they believe in. If the list is changed to something they <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe in -- eg, swapping solutions to problems from different <br/>\nperspectives -- most of the writers would leave. Not because they&#39;re <br/>\nsnooty! But because it&#39;s no longer a project they believe in. It <br/>\n*seems* like if you&#39;d get rid of the so called &quot;elitists&quot; and those <br/>\nwho have a strangle hold on ideas then lots more people would be able <br/>\nto speak up and then you&#39;d have the lovely open community for people <br/>\nto share freely in. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it doesn&#39;t work. Why? People *have* created lists for people to <br/>\nshare.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo create a vibrant list, you need to think about what makes people <br/>\nwant -- no, *need* as in put at the top of their priority list -- to <br/>\nwrite things that others find worth reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can someone create an open community for people to share that <br/>\nothers *need* to write something others want to read? That&#39;s the <br/>\nquestion you need to answer to create a non-judgemental unschooling <br/>\nlist that works.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* don&#39;t know the answer! But I do know how to create a list around <br/>\na very specific philosophy that people feel passionate about ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; No two families are going to run exactly the same way. Why not <br/>\n&gt; embrace our commonalities and accept our differences respectfully?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In real life I accept differences -- within my comfort level -- <br/>\nrespectfully. Most people I know in real life parent traditionally <br/>\nand send their kids to school. My purpose in interacting with them is <br/>\nto be friendly, not proselytize.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here on this list are people who&#39;ve come asking &quot;I want to <br/>\nunschool, but I&#39;ve got these problems.&quot; That&#39;s what this list is <br/>\n*for*. And that&#39;s something I feel strongly enough about to help <br/>\ncontribute to. It&#39;s a valuable use of my time.

Many people have said over the years that  <br/>\nthey want a list where everyone shares what they do and no one is  <br/>\njudged. Obviously it&#39;s a need being unmet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with creating such a list is that, after an initial  <br/>\nflurry, people won&#39;t write! I&#39;ve seen it happen over and over from  <br/>\nlists that branched off from UnschoolingDiscussion when people wanted  <br/>\nto create that kind of list. It *sounds* like a great idea. It sounds  <br/>\nlike meeting regularly with friends to just share and swap stories.  <br/>\nCool!<br/>\n<br/>\n(And if you *do* have a viable list please post it! So people can get  <br/>\nthat need met! *No one* wants people to stay on the list because they  <br/>\nthink this is the only option beginners have. Regular contributors  <br/>\n*do* want people to &quot;get&quot; unschooling because we think it&#39;s a great  <br/>\nidea! We would like people to be able to find a resource that works  <br/>\nfor them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen was the last time you wrote a letter to a friend just telling  <br/>\nabout the things going on in your life? Could you do that several  <br/>\ntimes a week?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that when we invest time in something, we need to  <br/>\nreceive something of equal value in return. This is true of anything  <br/>\nwe invest time in in our lives. The return might be a feeling of  <br/>\nsatisfaction. It might be feeling good about having helped someone.  <br/>\nIt might be information. It might be sharing time with friends. It  <br/>\nmight be accomplishing a task. It might be ... whatever floats your  <br/>\nboat :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with the type of list many people have said they want is  <br/>\nthat it doesn&#39;t return as much as it takes *from the writers*. For  <br/>\npeople to spend time writing -- so there&#39;s something for others to  <br/>\nread! --, the writers must have a need that gets fulfilled *by  <br/>\nwriting*. The need can&#39;t be fulfilled just from reading. If that need  <br/>\ncan be met just by reading, when they&#39;re done reading their internal  <br/>\nprioritizer starts sending out red alerts about things that would be  <br/>\noffering better returns for the time invested. ;-) &quot;Laundry ... Take  <br/>\nkids to park ... Read a book ... Watch TV ... Go pick up furnace  <br/>\nfilters ...&quot; (And if you don&#39;t have a pile of other things you could  <br/>\nbe doing then you&#39;re probably not a mom and probably not an  <br/>\nunschooler! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI spend a lot of time writing. I *could* spend that time reading, or  <br/>\ndrawing, or cleaning, or exercising, or sleeping. (I get up very  <br/>\nearly to avoid stealing family time.) I *choose* to spend that time  <br/>\nwriting because I get something valuable back from it. I love  <br/>\nwriting. I love crafting words. I love trying to make complex things  <br/>\nsimple. I could spend the time writing for magazines and get  <br/>\npaid! :-) But I choose to write answers for posts because the return  <br/>\nI get is a sense that my thinking is getting clearer and I don&#39;t get  <br/>\nthat same satisfaction from other things or even other types of  <br/>\nwriting. I don&#39;t know why others write. But whatever they&#39;re getting  <br/>\nback, it&#39;s something that&#39;s important enough to set aside time for.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a great idea to think of people trading stories about what&#39;s  <br/>\ngoing on in their lives, but it takes time to write up stories. And  <br/>\nthe people writing the stories need to get something back for the  <br/>\ntime it takes to write that they can&#39;t get if they don&#39;t write.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what people are wanting in a list is a coffee klatch, a get- <br/>\ntogether with people of like mind to swap bits of their lives. Sounds  <br/>\ncool. In real life people can get together to swap bits of their  <br/>\nlives because they have some connection with each other. The point  <br/>\nisn&#39;t the stories, the point is sharing with friends or others you  <br/>\nshare a bond with. But people can&#39;t just jump onto a list and find  <br/>\nthat, unfortunately. It&#39;s going to be a rare confluence of people who  <br/>\nall click and all feel a passion for writing about their lives to the  <br/>\npoint where they&#39;re willing to set aside an hour or more of their  <br/>\nlives several times a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian started a really cool list a couple of years ago. It&#39;s  <br/>\ncalled UnschoolingStories. It&#39;s just, as it says in the description,  <br/>\n&quot;stories of how unschooling works. We&#39;ll learn from each other by  <br/>\nsharing experiences and observations. It is not a discussion list,  <br/>\nnot a debate list, and not really even a &quot;support&quot; or &quot;advice&quot; list.&quot;  <br/>\nCool! And yet there were a total of 5 posts last year. Not because  <br/>\nthe idea is bad. It&#39;s a great idea. It&#39;s that there isn&#39;t enough  <br/>\nreturn for the time invested in writing. In fact there isn&#39;t enough  <br/>\nreturn to even forward a post written for another list. (If there  <br/>\nwere, people would do it!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason discussion lists like UnschoolingDiscussion and  <br/>\nUnschoolingBasics (and I assume AlwaysUnschooled) is that the writers  <br/>\nare getting back something they feel is valuable to them for the time  <br/>\nthey invest in writing. Part is they&#39;re helping build something they  <br/>\npassionately believe in. The other part is undoubtedly personal to  <br/>\neach person. People *will* find it a valuable use of  time writing  <br/>\nabout their problems. People *will* find it a valuable use of time to  <br/>\nanswer when they feel their answer is helping to build something  <br/>\nthey&#39;re passionate about.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who want the coffee klatch type of list you need to create  <br/>\nsomething that people *need* to write for. Not just read! Not just  <br/>\nwant to write for! *Need* to write for. Something they&#39;re willing to  <br/>\nset an hour or so of their life aside to contribute to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd has sort of a coffee klatch list: AlwaysLearning, for  <br/>\nthose who already get unschooling to just talk about their lives. A  <br/>\nfair number of the posts are similar to UnschoolingDiscussion: people  <br/>\nbringing in problems they&#39;re having getting unschooling. If you take  <br/>\naway those there wouldn&#39;t be many posts left. The rest is mostly  <br/>\nSandra and occasionally others offering &quot;Here&#39;s something that&#39;s  <br/>\ncool.&quot; It might be a slice of life or philosophy or idea or website  <br/>\nand some discussion afterwards. But it works not because it&#39;s a  <br/>\ncoffee klatch but because the people there like Sandra and the  <br/>\natmosphere she can create. They come for that. If they don&#39;t like  <br/>\nSandra or the atmosphere they shouldn&#39;t come! The list works not  <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s a trading of ideas but because of Sandra.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey say if you build it, they will come ;-) But it takes more than  <br/>\njust creating a list to build something that people want to come to.  <br/>\nIt needs to provide something people want to read. That part might  <br/>\ncome from a strong personality who just likes to write that people  <br/>\nenjoy reading :-) (Blogs!) It needs to provide something people want  <br/>\nto write for. And that&#39;s harder.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a list like that could work if there were a strong  <br/>\npersonality behind a list (or message board) like that. Someone who  <br/>\nfelt passionate enough about it to write even when no one was  <br/>\nresponding. Creating something that others would not only love to  <br/>\nread but love to contribute to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it could work *maybe* if there were a weekly topic. Maybe  <br/>\npeople would overcome the downsides of a mish mosh of philosophies if  <br/>\nthere were a specific topic to write about. But again I think it  <br/>\nwould take someone with a passion about the project and a  strong  <br/>\npersonality to drum up interest to keep it going. That&#39;s just a guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list works because of the passion of Ren and Kelly and the  <br/>\npassion of the people willing to set aside time to write for  <br/>\nsomething they believe in. If the list is changed to something they  <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe in -- eg, swapping solutions to problems from different  <br/>\nperspectives -- most of the writers would leave. Not because they&#39;re  <br/>\nsnooty! But because it&#39;s no longer a project they believe in. It  <br/>\n*seems* like if you&#39;d get rid of the so called &quot;elitists&quot; and those  <br/>\nwho have a strangle hold on ideas then lots more people would be able  <br/>\nto speak up and then you&#39;d have the lovely open community for people  <br/>\nto share freely in. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it doesn&#39;t work. Why? People *have* created lists for people to  <br/>\nshare.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo create a vibrant list, you need to think about what makes people  <br/>\nwant -- no, *need* as in put at the top of their priority list -- to  <br/>\nwrite things that others find worth reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can someone create an open community for people to share that  <br/>\nothers *need* to write something others want to read? That&#39;s the  <br/>\nquestion you need to answer to create a non-judgemental unschooling  <br/>\nlist that works.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* don&#39;t know the answer! But I do know how to create a list around  <br/>\na very specific philosophy that people feel passionate about ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; No two families are going to run exactly the same way. Why not  <br/>\n&gt; embrace our commonalities and accept our differences respectfully?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In real life I accept differences -- within my comfort level --  <br/>\nrespectfully. Most people I know in real life parent traditionally  <br/>\nand send their kids to school. My purpose in interacting with them is  <br/>\nto be friendly, not proselytize.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here on this list are people who&#39;ve come asking &quot;I want to  <br/>\nunschool, but I&#39;ve got these problems.&quot; That&#39;s what this list is  <br/>\n*for*. And that&#39;s something I feel strongly enough about to help  <br/>\ncontribute to. It&#39;s a valuable use of my time. It&#39;s not a gathering  <br/>\nplace for beginning unschoolers to swap what they&#39;re trying out.  <br/>\nThough I understand why people would like to have that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel passionate about helping to build a place that&#39;s a mish  <br/>\nmosh of philosophies.
