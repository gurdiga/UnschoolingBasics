There is a small little book <br/>\nfor each age and I find them at my local library (although they&#39;re also on <br/>\namazon).  They were published back in the 70&#39;s so there is quite a lot you have to <br/>\nignore (the parts giving parenting advise for sure), but thankfully most of <br/>\nthe books are focused specifically on what behavioural stages each age brings, <br/>\nand how kids think at different age.  I&#39;ve found them very helpful and a <br/>\nreally quick read...well, especially is you do like I do, and just skim through for <br/>\nthe parts that pertain to us :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDenise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1207,"nextTopicId":1204}}
