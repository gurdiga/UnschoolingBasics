I&#39;m back from  <br/>\nholidays, now, and would like to ask the same question here.  TIA<br/>\n<br/>\n*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nI am the raffle/silent auction coordinator  for the Life is Good  <br/>\nconference in Vancouver, WA this year and wanted to ask if anyone had  <br/>\nsome ideas (either from experiences at conferences with their own kids  <br/>\nor observing what happens with other families) to help sensitive  <br/>\nchildren deal with the disappointment of &quot;losing&quot; a raffle item or  <br/>\nbeing outbid on a particularly tempting auction basket.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe already have an &quot;Instant Gratification Table&quot; with mostly little  <br/>\nkid stuff for a $1 ticket, which helps. But both young and older kids  <br/>\nhave fallen apart when the results of the raffle and auction are known.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few of us have discussed the possibility of a less &quot;competitive&quot;  <br/>\nfundraising method (and that&#39;s a topic for another time, I think), but  <br/>\nwe&#39;re not at that stage yet. We just want to be able to help  the  <br/>\nsensitive kids and their parents navigate this part of the conference,  <br/>\nin that rarified atmosphere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m planning to talk about this on the Life is Good conference list,  <br/>\ntoo, and appreciate any insights or ideas you all might have for me to  <br/>\nbring there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38608,"nextTopicId":38616}}
