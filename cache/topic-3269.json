Have you had to make any choices with family on<br/>\n  this issue?Did the family member always accept your position? If not have<br/>\n  you &quot;not seen them?&quot; Has it made any problems in your immediate family?<br/>\n    This is probably a pretty flawed reasoning but we know no other<br/>\n  unschoolers. When we get together it is mostly homeschoolers (school at<br/>\nhome<br/>\n  type) and occasionally public school kids.We don&#39;t see eye to eye on<br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We used to be the strict schoolers that had no tv, no computer games or<br/>\n  video games. It seemed we knew families that allowed it and we were the<br/>\nodd<br/>\n  man out. The past year we are now the ones with computer & video games and<br/>\n  allow tv.I thought we would fit in better but not so.It is a new group<br/>\nthis<br/>\n  year and  I listen to the discussions at karate & swimming about how<br/>\n  terrible they are or &quot;we don&#39;t allow that in our house.&quot; I was asked once<br/>\nif<br/>\n  we allowed video games...I said &quot;yes, my son has an xbox he bought with<br/>\nhis<br/>\n  own money. he really enjoys it.&quot; Silence!!<br/>\n    I try to find things to talk about that we agree on and stay away from<br/>\nthe<br/>\n  differences. The homeschoolers seem cliquish and it doesn&#39;t take much to<br/>\n  feel you don&#39;t belong. At swimming I have had to go up to the women to<br/>\nstart<br/>\n  a conversation. It doesn&#39;t last long. Now I just go and sit/watch the kids<br/>\n  swim. It is for them anyway.<br/>\n    My husband is in another state getting ready to deploy overseas....I<br/>\njust<br/>\n  talked to him on the cell phone. I asked him about talking to his family<br/>\n  (parents) and he said he has no problem...I am the one that talks him out<br/>\nof<br/>\n  it. He&#39;s right. I had said that on a previous post. I need to work on it.<br/>\n    He also told me that I need to put the kids before others ideas or<br/>\n  opinions. If we don&#39;t have many outside friends that&#39;s ok...as long as<br/>\nwe&#39;re<br/>\n  together as a family and everythings ok. What good is it to have friends<br/>\nyou<br/>\n  aren&#39;t yourself with and you don&#39;t agree with?<br/>\n  I miss him being here to talk to.<br/>\n    thanks for listening and helping me to see the real issue is with me<br/>\n  sharon<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I&#39;ve been reading all these comments on allowing kids to say no to unwanted physical contact and am so glad to hear it.  I have a vivid memory of when I was a little girl hiding behind a reclining chair while my parents and grandparents were making me &quot;go and give your &quot;uncle&quot; a kiss...&quot;  I was so scared and felt so bad at the same time that I was hurting his feelings.  I ended up letting him hug me....It&#39;s odd now when I look at how that lesson played a very large part in my future relations with the opposite sex.  Thankfully now I have had the privilege of standing up for my daughter where her grandfather was concerned.  I was nervous and scared to confront him ( hurt his feelings..), but I spoke to the man on the phone and confronted him with my daughter&#39;s concern.  Even though I believe the grandfather to be innocent in his actions, I knew the effect it would have on my daughter in the long run.  The sad part is I could never stand up for myself.  The great part and the liberating part is that I now get the chance to help my own daughter set boundries for her future...<br/>\n<br/>\nTara   <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Genant2@...\">Genant2@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n  Never, maybe because I am directing my comments to my sons, it is in  earshot <br/>\n  of the person asking for the hug or the kiss, but is not confronting  them or <br/>\n  saying that what they are doing is bad, directly.

If their own parents force them to hug or kiss<br/>\nagainst their will, how will they know how to resist when someone else asks<br/>\nthem to do it?<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to add that it&#39;s also a boundary issue and one thing that&#39;s helped<br/>\nmy kids is our having strong ways of stating our boundaries particuarly<br/>\nabout our bodies.  I was at my SIL&#39;s one day when my son was young and my<br/>\nbrother was playing a chase game with him that my son was thoroughly<br/>\nenjoying.  But when my brother got close, my son screamed at the top of his<br/>\nlungs.  My SIL went up gently, got down on his level and said &quot;Hey, Nicky,<br/>\nyou can use your stop sign like this..&quot; and she put up her hand in a stop<br/>\nsign.  We all loved it and thus the &quot;Body Stop Sign&quot; was born at our house -<br/>\nit has been fabulous and is enforced by me when necessary but generally just<br/>\nhugely respected by each kid because they want it to be respected when they<br/>\nuse it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids should definitely know that they can speak up and be supported if a<br/>\nrelative is doing something they don&#39;t like to their bodies.  My favorite<br/>\nstory about this is that my father in law who is Sicilian is very tuned out<br/>\nto  younger kids in particular and likes to just grab the younger ones and<br/>\nhug them.  To him it&#39;s a game.  To them it&#39;s terrifying to be grabbed<br/>\nagainst your will and submitted to a hug.  He&#39;s ruined his relationship with<br/>\nhis oldest Grandaughter, Chiara, over this type of treatment.  We live<br/>\nfurther away, but it was an issue for my daughter as well - and given that<br/>\nshe&#39;s highly sensitive, she FELT it a lot.  Now the thing is that my Mother<br/>\nin law is always telling him to cut it out (usually in a string of<br/>\nSicilian) - she is fabulous about respecting kids&#39; space and letting them<br/>\ncome to her after they connect with her.  So I&#39;ve never felt the need to<br/>\nhave a specific conversation with my FIL about it since his wife is forever<br/>\nhaving that conversation with him but not to much permanent effect.  Since<br/>\nwe don&#39;t see them often, it wasn&#39;t a real biggie, but they visited when my<br/>\nson was young and my daughter was about 3 or so.  Usual grabbing thing and<br/>\nthen MIL telling him off ... my dd was sitting on a chair regarding him that<br/>\nfirst day of the visit and she turned to me (close by and ready to intervene<br/>\nto prevent any grabbing trauma) and said &quot;Mama, how do we get the grab out<br/>\nof Nonno?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell it was a bit uncomfortable with my FIL sitting right there, but I<br/>\nignored my own social stuff and said &quot;Well, maybe you could tell him how<br/>\nmuch you don&#39;t like it and ask him not to do it again.&quot;  So she turned to my<br/>\nFIL and said &quot;Nonno, I don&#39;t like it when you grab me.  Could you please<br/>\nstop?&quot;  And do you know what?  He DID.  He NEVER grabbed her again which<br/>\nshows the power of her saying it to him instead of all of us whom he<br/>\nprobably dismissed in his head as not getting that it was playful.  In his<br/>\nhead I think he really thought the kids enjoyed it regardless of their<br/>\nreactions which he wasn&#39;t tuned into.  It took her telling him for him to<br/>\nreally get it and WOW, what empowerment for my daughter!  We went out this<br/>\npast April to visit my in-laws (they are in Michigan, we are in<br/>\nMassachusetts) for Easter and my daughter decided her &quot;favorite&quot; was Nonno -<br/>\nshe sat in his gruff lap and kissed him much to my astonishment all the time<br/>\nand wow, did it change his demeanor and his gruffness to have her doing<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one story with a good ending....on the other side of things, I have a<br/>\nBIL near me (my sister&#39;s husband) who yells at his daughter a lot and<br/>\ndespite conversations I&#39;ve had with him about it, he just can&#39;t control<br/>\nhimself enough not to do the yelling around us (it&#39;s not &quot;at&quot; my dd, and<br/>\nit&#39;s not derrogatory stuff with name calling but she&#39;s very sensitive to how<br/>\nothers are treated and I agree).  So she&#39;s decided she doesn&#39;t want to be<br/>\naround him anymore although she still loves my niece his daughter, so we are<br/>\nhonoring that despite the difficulty of telling him about it and arranging<br/>\nplaydates with my niece where she doesn&#39;t see him for more than a pickup or<br/>\ndrop off.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I&#39;m not a confrontational person at all, so I&#39;ve had to drag myself<br/>\ninto doing these things, but I do it because the import to my kids and their<br/>\nfuture lives and feelings about themselves is huge and way more important<br/>\nthan my own reluctance, embarassment or any adult hurt feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157069585,"authorName":"Jen Wiley-Cordone","from":"Jen Wiley-Cordone &lt;jwileycordone@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] forcing gratitude","postDate":"1095942367","msgId":3302,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxNTJDMERGLjQwMjAxMDVAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNGYwMWM0YTE5YyRlMzY3ODk0MCQwMzAwYThjMEBQQVZJTElPTj4=","referencesHeader":"PDkwLjRjNDExYmNlLjJlODMzNjMwQGFvbC5jb20+IDwwMDRmMDFjNGExOWMkZTM2Nzg5NDAkMDMwMGE4YzBAUEFWSUxJT04+"},"prevInTopic":3300,"nextInTopic":3305,"prevInTime":3301,"nextInTime":3303,"topicId":3269,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just adding another note.

If not have<br/>\nyou &quot;not seen them?&quot; Has it made any problems in your immediate family?\r<br/>\n  This is probably a pretty flawed reasoning but we know no other<br/>\nunschoolers. When we get together it is mostly homeschoolers (school at home<br/>\ntype) and occasionally public school kids.We don&#39;t see eye to eye on things.<br/>\n\r<br/>\n We used to be the strict schoolers that had no tv, no computer games or<br/>\nvideo games. It seemed we knew families that allowed it and we were the odd<br/>\nman out. The past year we are now the ones with computer & video games and<br/>\nallow tv.I thought we would fit in better but not so.It is a new group this<br/>\nyear and  I listen to the discussions at karate & swimming about how<br/>\nterrible they are or &quot;we don&#39;t allow that in our house.&quot; I was asked once if<br/>\nwe allowed video games...I said &quot;yes, my son has an xbox he bought with his<br/>\nown money. he really enjoys it.&quot; Silence!!\r<br/>\n  I try to find things to talk about that we agree on and stay away from the<br/>\n differences. The homeschoolers seem cliquish and it doesn&#39;t take much to<br/>\nfeel you don&#39;t belong. At swimming I have had to go up to the women to start<br/>\na conversation. It doesn&#39;t last long. Now I just go and sit/watch the kids<br/>\nswim. It is for them anyway.\r<br/>\n  My husband is in another state getting ready to deploy overseas....I just<br/>\ntalked to him on the cell phone. I asked him about talking to his family<br/>\n(parents) and he said he has no problem...I am the one that talks him out of<br/>\nit. He&#39;s right. I had said that on a previous post. I need to work on it.\r<br/>\n  He also told me that I need to put the kids before others ideas or<br/>\nopinions. If we don&#39;t have many outside friends that&#39;s ok...as long as we&#39;re<br/>\ntogether as a family and everythings ok. What good is it to have friends you<br/>\naren&#39;t yourself with and you don&#39;t agree with? \r<br/>\nI miss him being here to talk to.\r<br/>\n  thanks for listening and helping me to see the real issue is with me\r<br/>\nsharon<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":173749108,"authorName":"Sharon Thomas","from":"&quot;Sharon Thomas&quot; &lt;meplusfive@...&gt;","profile":"meplusfive","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] forcing gratitude","postDate":"1095870772","msgId":3293,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxNTFBOTM0LjAwMDAwOS4wMjU4MEBLSURTPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTIyMTYxNjMxLkQyMEI4NTY4ODNAbWFpbC5hZGhvc3QuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3292,"nextInTopic":3294,"prevInTime":3292,"nextInTime":3294,"topicId":3269,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kate, thanks!! that approach sounds very do-able for me.

The first time I realized this was when I <br/>\nwas upstairs in my bed in loooong labor with baby #1 and just needed to <br/>\n-sleep-.  My mom popped over to be where the excitement was but at this <br/>\npoint there wasn&#39;t much going on except &#39;stalled&#39; labor.  He forbade my <br/>\nmother from going upstairs &quot;just for a minute&quot; because he knew that I <br/>\nwould struggle to stay awake and make small talk with her instead of <br/>\ngetting the sleep I so desperately needed.  He blocked the stairs and <br/>\neverything until she left in a huff.

She&#39;s nine <br/>\nyears younger than me and used to leave notes lying around for me to <br/>\nfind, &quot;Why are you ruining Laurie&#39;s life?&quot;  things like that. I <br/>\nbelieve my sister would be less rigid in spite of being a <br/>\nteacher/curriculum coordinator, but my bil is extremely rigid and <br/>\ndomineering and she tries to keep him happy too. She&#39;s one of these <br/>\nwomen that can never say no. Because of that, she&#39;s suffering from <br/>\nmore health issues than anyone in our extended family. Her stress <br/>\nlevel is off the charts. My bil had a heart attack earlier this <br/>\nyear. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey are Christian, but not fanatically so, although with her recent <br/>\nwave of health problems, she seems to have turned more to God than <br/>\never before. My theory is that bil is rigid because he grew up in a <br/>\nhome that was full of angst, anger, alcohol abuse and 4 sisters who <br/>\nwere all younger than him. He was the man of the house from a very <br/>\nyoung age. He grew up in a chaotic home with no guidance (it seems) <br/>\nand wants to make sure he keeps a firm hand on discipline with his <br/>\nboys. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this is just guessing for me. They are pretty closed about <br/>\nfeelings and refuse to discuss issues where we disagree. My sister <br/>\nand I agreed to keep opinions to ourselves years ago when I <br/>\nsuggested she try brown rice and whole wheat bread and her anger <br/>\nastounded me. Needless to say, the kind of parenting I did is not <br/>\nopen to discussion. :-(  It truly saddens me because she would be an <br/>\nawesome unschooling mom. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith their friends, they seem to hold themselves up as the couple to <br/>\nemulate. Perfection runs rampant! They are so very very hard on <br/>\nthemselves. He works fulltime and owns two carwashes and she works <br/>\novertime daily (without extra pay) and is the head of communications <br/>\nfor the teachers in the entire parish. She also teaches Sunday <br/>\nSchool. An overachiever who&#39;s killing herself for everyone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course you can come spend the evening with me! I spent 30 minutes <br/>\ntoday laughing at Maelu. I gave her the empty peanut butter jar and <br/>\nshe got every tiny bit of it from the bottom then shredded the <br/>\nlabel.
