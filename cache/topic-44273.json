Friends of ours (Mum and 2 girls)have red hair/ fair skin - prime candidates for painful sunburn (including blisters) never mind any long term damage. Her solution was that they found lots of fun hats, and long sleeved clothes, and teamed these with longer dresses or pants. So the girls were playing dress ups to go out (and the bonus was that little of the sensitive skin was out). They often look rather eclectic, both girls have a strong sense of who they are and of the clothes they like. The 13 year old now chooses to wear the spaghetti strap dresses but in her own fashion, throws a long sleeve white t-shirt underneath. My friend also plans lots of fun outings to indoor venues when its a really high UV day. And we do our outdoor things together more often in winter.<br/>\nOn the days when there was a sunburn - lots of love and understanding.

I am currently on  hols with <br/>\nmy 4 year old dd and husband (and enjoying a rare few sunny days  here in <br/>\nIreland). Howver this is our problem. My dd dislikes the texture of  suncream<br/>\nso won&#39;t wear it. That&#39;s fine I understand this (she<br/>\nhas always  struggled with textures - she goes<br/>\nthrough phases where she hates the feel  of<br/>\nwater). So to keep the sun off her I have plenty of long light trousers,  <br/>\nand long sleeved tops. I have also asked her to wear a sunhat to keep the sun <br/>\n off her face. She had been doing it, but today she refused. She is fair  <br/>\nskinned like me (has a touch of my red<br/>\nhair), so I am worried she will burn  (I am obsessed with sun cream for <br/>\nmyself). I have<br/>\nexplained to her about  her skin and that if not protected it burns easier <br/>\nthan other peoples skin -  like her Dad&#39;s for example. But she just<br/>\nshuts down when I explain things  like this.<br/>\nAny ideas? Am I being over-protective? As a parent striving to  respect my<br/>\ndaughter do I just leave her at it? I&#39;m confused as to what to  do. I would <br/>\nappreciate ideas - might not be able to reply though depending on  where we <br/>\nend up next (reception wise) <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nMary <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205848305,"authorName":"aoibhneas7","from":"&quot;aoibhneas7&quot; &lt;aoibhneas7@...&gt;","profile":"aoibhneas7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Advice needed please","postDate":"1274545096","msgId":44273,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh0OTA0OCtidjJrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44275,"prevInTime":44272,"nextInTime":44274,"topicId":44273,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all I am just wondering how you would handle this.
