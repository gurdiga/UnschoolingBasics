She isn&#39;t<br/>\nhaving a traditional party this year so my sister threw together a<br/>\nlast minute home celebration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids were running around with some tissue paper that was really<br/>\ncolorful, making it into &quot;dresses&quot; and &quot;scarves&quot;.  I was lamenting the<br/>\nloss of ATC material and said &quot;hey you guys, why don&#39;t we save that<br/>\nfor a project?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLeaAnn says &quot;They ARE using it for a project&quot;.<br/>\nGawd, I love radical unschoolers.:) It was a big &quot;DUH&quot; moment....the<br/>\nkind where you really wonder how it popped out of your mouth.<br/>\nTissue paper is CHEAP and I was wanting to save it for some future<br/>\nproject when they were joyfully creating things???!!! If I&#39;d been <br/>\nholding a book, I would have smacked myself in the head with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo,<br/>\nwe talked about how many thoughts/ideas don&#39;t just go away, but we<br/>\nlearn to keep our mouths shut better! LeaAnn and I both react to<br/>\ncertain projects internally with &quot;ooh, we can&#39;t waste food&quot; or such<br/>\nthings, but we&#39;ve simply learned to ignore that voice and let our<br/>\nchildren explore joyfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what we&#39;re doing as parents, is not only shifting thoughts, but<br/>\nlearning to LIVE with some of them and not act on them. That&#39;s how<br/>\nunschooling has a chance to really take hold.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12494,"nextTopicId":12504}}
