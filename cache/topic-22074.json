I left my abusive husband in 2004. <br/>\nHe has bounced in and out of ds life. I tried everything I could to <br/>\nget him to connect or care about his children (he has a son (11) by a <br/>\nprevious marriage) when we were together. DS has never wanted to have <br/>\nvisitation either. He says that his daddy is mean and that he is <br/>\nafraid. I am in the middle of my third custody battle in less then <br/>\nthree years, and despite my husband beating our child during his <br/>\nfirst unsupervised visit, he still has visitation. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe court, nor the guardian ad litem (attorney appointed to represent <br/>\nds&#39;s best interests) have been interested in what ds feels, or <br/>\nfrankly, needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast year I was having to drag my child out from underneath the bed <br/>\nand forcing him to visit his dad - at a great cost to our <br/>\nrelationship (not to mention his development). When ds came home with <br/>\nbruises, I could no longer force him to go. I now have a 90 day <br/>\nsuspending jail sentence  - suspended as long as I force ds to go to <br/>\nvisitation. <br/>\n<br/>\nAtleast now ds is better able to articulate and understand things, <br/>\nbut it breaks my heart when he cries and begs me to please not send <br/>\nhim to daddy. It takes everything I have to keep it together as I <br/>\nwatch ds scream, kick, and cry in anger and pain over his situation. <br/>\nI will spare you the horrors of recent visitation, but I will say <br/>\nthat I am so outraged at how the legal system is failing our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I thought my husband had  even the slighest desire to know his <br/>\nson, I would bend over backwards to help. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor now, all it seems that I can do is to love ds, listen to him, and <br/>\nbe there for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that it has helped me to have a counselor and small <br/>\nnetwork of folks who care about me. Reading here and at always <br/>\nunschooling really helps too. Ds has a counselor and I think she is <br/>\nreally helpful for him and me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish there was some way to get the other parent in these cases to <br/>\nsee what they are missing and all the damage they are doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n  <br/>\n-- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;natalijoi&quot; &lt;natalijoi@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello!

His view is that Ryan should not <br/>\n&gt; be allowed to &quot;run the show&quot; <br/>\n&gt; Any unschooling literature I give him goes unread, and he <br/>\n&gt; becomes beligerent if I try to &quot;tell him how to parent his son&quot; <br/>\n&gt; His wife and I do communicate, we discuss the issues between Ryan <br/>\n&gt; and his dad and she is open to the gentle and attachment parenting <br/>\n&gt; styles, but her way, although loving, is jokey, a bit sarcastic, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; really just trying to cope with it all.

He is 4, will be 5 <br/>\n&gt; in August, and he lives with me during the week, and at his dad&#39;s <br/>\n </span></blockquote>on <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; weekends.<br/>\n&gt;  Now, this man, he is a person who doesn&#39;t engage in his children&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; lives the way that I would wish for my son, but he still wants to <br/>\n&gt; make the decisions about the biggies (healthcare, school, religion) <br/>\n&gt; There are many many issues, but I will just throw this one out <br/>\n </span></blockquote>there <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; because I feel that it is the root of the situation.<br/>\n&gt; We broke up July of 2005, and Ryan has been going to his dad&#39;s <br/>\n </span></blockquote>every <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; weekend, except maybe 3 or 4 times his dad was out of town on <br/>\n&gt; business. Ryan has, from day one, NOT wanted to go to his dad&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; house. he will ask me every day, many times a day, &quot;where am I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>going <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; today? where am I going tomorrow? Can I stay here forever?&quot; From <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; beginning I have talked with him about it, listened to his <br/>\n </span></blockquote>feelings, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and been honest with him. I ask him why he doesn&#39;t want to go, and <br/>\n&gt; he tells me that his dad is mean to him. His dad is a very <br/>\n&gt; emotionally reserved guy; he is really a loner, and has little <br/>\n&gt; understanding of the connective needs of the people who love him. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>He <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is remarried, and has a stepson, 9, a daughter he has partial <br/>\n&gt; custody of,9 and a 1 year old baby; they are expecting again in the <br/>\n&gt; fall. <br/>\n&gt; I explain to Ryan that his daddy loves him; sometimes he is grumpy <br/>\n&gt; or upset, and he has trouble knowing what Ryan needs from him. I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>try <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to help Ryan to express what he needs, like &quot;dad, I just need a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>hug&quot; <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or &quot;I&#39;m hungry, tired, sad, etc.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; (which makes me sad; that he has to be SO aware of his own needs, <br/>\n&gt; that he cannot depend on them to meet these needs) There is very <br/>\n&gt; little I can do on the dad front. His view is that Ryan should not <br/>\n&gt; be allowed to &quot;run the show&quot; <br/>\n&gt; Any unschooling literature I give him goes unread, and he <br/>\n&gt; becomes beligerent if I try to &quot;tell him how to parent his son&quot; <br/>\n&gt; His wife and I do communicate, we discuss the issues between Ryan <br/>\n&gt; and his dad and she is open to the gentle and attachment parenting <br/>\n&gt; styles, but her way, although loving, is jokey, a bit sarcastic, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; really just trying to cope with it all. Not very proactive. <br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t change them, I try to give as much feedback and influence <br/>\n </span></blockquote>as <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they are receptive to- try not to make them feel as though I am <br/>\n&gt; instructing them, but they just are not as emotionally connected to <br/>\n&gt; their kids. <br/>\n&gt; What I really want is for Ryan to get his needs met, and at this <br/>\n&gt; point, I really need some good communication methods and coping <br/>\n&gt; skills to bestow upon him, he needs me, and is asking me, for ways <br/>\n&gt; to deal with the very different and kindof lonely life he has <br/>\n </span></blockquote>there. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I do not want a custody war, I think that would be far more <br/>\n&gt; damaging, and I don&#39;t think it is conducive to the peace I am <br/>\n&gt; striving to create and promote in the lives of our triad.<br/>\n&gt; His new expression of the frustration he feels has been &quot;mom, it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; not good for me to go back and forth between two houses&quot; which I <br/>\n&gt; think is very emotionally articulate for a 4 year old, but I can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; seem to give him any words of comfort, he just keeps saying it over <br/>\n&gt; and over again. I mean, like, 10-15 times daily for at least two <br/>\n&gt; weeks now. We talk about it, I tell him how I feel, how his dad <br/>\n&gt; feels, ask him questions, and I am honest, I let him know that it <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t my choice, which I don&#39;t think is helping, but I don&#39;t know <br/>\n&gt; what else to say. (I really don&#39;t want to say, &#39;you cant always get <br/>\n&gt; whatcha want!!&#39;  :)<br/>\n&gt; Also, does anyone know how I can get maybe court ordered counseling <br/>\n&gt; for the three, or more, of us? I just don&#39;t know how to reach this <br/>\n&gt; man, that he is losing his son, without railroading him into <br/>\n&gt; counseling, (he would absolutely not go on his own) I am just so <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sad <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; for my little guy, that he has to feel this way about his dad, that <br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t find the words, or actions, to help him. I mean, how can we <br/>\n&gt; affect unwilling others&#39; attitudes towards our children?

That was how we ended up on an ever-other-<br/>\nweekend plan with Rayan, transitioning bewteen two vastly different <br/>\nsets of expectations was excruciating for him.

It *isn&#39;t* good to go back and forth. It makes you <br/>\nfeel...sad, frustrated, unheard,&quot; whatever you are understanding <br/>\nfrom him. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.

It won&#39;t do any of you any good to have a <br/>\nresistant Ex *and* a counsellor who is trying to convince you to use <br/>\ntime-outs and set more rules! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do find a supportive counsellor, you might want to start with <br/>\njust you and your son going for awhile.
