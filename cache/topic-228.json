I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know it at the time, but it was the natural progression of what<br/>\nwe had already been doing.  We&#39;re very much into the whole<br/>\nattachment/mindful parenting philosophy.  I understand that some<br/>\nunschool only when it comes to education while others, the radical<br/>\nunschoolers, have incorporated the philosophy as a lifestyle.  I have to<br/>\nadmit, for us, the education aspect only made sense after &quot;getting&quot; the<br/>\nentire philosophy.  I learn more each day on how to improve our lives by<br/>\nincorporating more and more the unschooling philosophy.  This group is<br/>\ninstrumental in our ability to do that.  Thank you all.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe other day I took my 5 year-old to a party where they had a pinata.<br/>\nMy daughter, like all the other girls, sat on the floor collecting<br/>\ngoodies by placing them well within her personal space to then transfer<br/>\nthe accumulated goodies in a goody-bag.  Another little girl went into<br/>\nmy daughter&#39;s stash and took some of her stuff.  My daughter was upset<br/>\nand yelled at the little girl letting her know it wasn&#39;t ok for her to<br/>\ntake her stuff and asked for it back.  The other little girl proceded to<br/>\ntake another goody from my daughter&#39;s stash.  I told my daughter that I<br/>\nagreed with her that it was not nice of the little girl to take that<br/>\nfrom her, that I understood how upset she was at having been violated,<br/>\nbut she was still upset and crying.  While I&#39;m talking to her, the<br/>\nlittle girl makes a third attempt, at which time, in a knee-jerk<br/>\nresponse, I looked at the little girl as I shook my head and told her to<br/>\nstop, that what she was doing was wrong.  The little girl&#39;s mom was not<br/>\nthere and I didn&#39;t feel it was my place to even say what I had said.  My<br/>\ndaughter complained to the birthday girl&#39;s mom who simply responded with<br/>\nan &quot;oh, well.&quot;  I felt that my inability to help resolve the situation<br/>\nmay lead my daughter to believe that she should take matters into her<br/>\nown hands and go get her stuff back which will only escalate matters.<br/>\nWe left shortly after that.

So here we are in our first year of homeschooling. We have <br/>\nvery different philosophies. I lean more towards unschooling and he <br/>\nprefers a school-at-home approach.

My husband and I <br/>\njust started homeschooling this year. It was originally his idea and <br/>\nthen this past school year, after some minor problems, I took off <br/>\nwith it. So here we are in our first year of homeschooling. We have <br/>\nvery different philosophies. I lean more towards unschooling and he <br/>\nprefers a school-at-home approach.  We both work and have chosen to <br/>\nbe generally responsible for different subjects although it works out <br/>\nthat we both do all subjects just as the nature of the game. The kids <br/>\nwere all for it and seem to be enjoying it so far although I do think <br/>\nthey miss seeing their friends in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the question:<br/>\nIt seems since everyone else went back to school the kids have been <br/>\ncomplaining, bickering, picking on each other, uncooperative, and any <br/>\nother adjective you can think of that is similar. This is definately <br/>\nnot typical for them. Usually, DH and I express how lucky we are and <br/>\ncount our blessings that they are so cooperative, appreciative, <br/>\nrespectful, mild mannered , etc. after we have some of their friends <br/>\nover. I have attributed the change in their behavior to the change in <br/>\nlifestyle (schooling).  What I want to know is... has anyone else <br/>\nexperienced this and if so what did you do about it? Any advice would <br/>\nbe appreciated.  We really need help in this matter. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJennifer</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"intro and question","postDate":"1087168620","msgId":690,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNhaW45Yyt1ZjYyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":228,"nextInTopic":3376,"prevInTime":689,"nextInTime":691,"topicId":228,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe with my outside perspective, since I have only girls, I can help.

And how much do you leave up to them?  Is<br/>\nthis something that has varied over your years of unschooling with insight<br/>\nyou have gained in the process of unschooling?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMAN, these are some advanced questions already!:) Good stuff to talk about.<br/>\n <br/>\nI dig up possible resources when I see they are excited about a topic, just as you were talking about. Often, as Pam said, they want to &quot;play&quot; with an idea and not really delve into books or videos, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t offer of course! When I find a book, video, game, project etc.. related to something I think they&#39;d enjoy, I tell them about it. Sometimes, if it&#39;s something I would enjoy having anyway, I just buy it. It&#39;s pretty obvious when you offer a video on a topic (or any other resource) and they aren&#39;t excited about it. There are times I simply say &quot;Oh, I picked up this __________ about the Civil War if you want to look at it&quot; and put it on the table.<br/>\nSometimes I am interested in the topic and invite them to join me.<br/>\nSometimes, a child says &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot;, and I find an interesting book, video, tv show, game, project or other resource to help them break through the wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, there is no &quot;right&quot; answer for sharing information with our children. I think it&#39;s the underlying reasons that are important, the underlying philosophies of &quot;why&quot; that really matter.<br/>\nIf we&#39;re sharing it in a spirit of interest, of excitement about learning and because we think they&#39;d enjoy it, then there won&#39;t be a problem. Pam&#39;s list of guidelines was really cool!<br/>\nIf we&#39;re getting them materials and resources because we think they &quot;need&quot; to learn something, then we&#39;ll probably muck it all up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese things vary a LOT around here. My dd Sierra, loves all things academic and WANTS to have someone sit and show her letters, help her read, take specific time to show her things. She would probably enjoy certain aspects of school. She&#39;s already figured out that she&#39;d lose too much freedom though, and she loves that as well.<br/>\nMy older boys on the other hand, hate anything that looks schoolish in the LEAST! They learn best from taking things apart, putting things together, playing video games etc...And apart from those similarities I just listed, they are both radically different in how I approach them with resources.<br/>\nTrevor, at 14, mostly wants to do his own thing. I still offer stuff to him, because I really know if it&#39;s computer related he&#39;ll jump on it, but for the most part, he self-educates.<br/>\nJared is the epitome of a joyful learner. He wants to try ethnic foods, go new places, ask a million really amazing questions and try sciency sorts of experiments to learn new things (he comes up with his own experiments, the last one was about burning chili peppers to learn about the volatile oils).<br/>\nTo give you an example of my Sierra girl, she just came up to me while I&#39;m typing here, and set a paper in front of me. She put glue in a coffee filter, between the two of us and pulled out a bag of fake flowers. She said &quot;we&#39;re going to do a project now Mom. Take these flowers and use the glue and you can make a pretty picture with them. Isn&#39;t this a good idea Mom?&quot;<br/>\nHey, at least I don&#39;t have to think up her &quot;lessons&quot; for her!! :) lol<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I need to glue some flowers with my girl for now. Two boys are playing starcraft and wee Jalen boy is watching Tom and Jerry, while chewing on his finger.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, this &quot;strewing&quot; thing is different for each of us. The thing that remains constant, is I&#39;m sharing my life with whole people that I trust to make the best choices for their own lives. I live with them the way I live with dh....sharing interests, learning from each other and trusting in each others abilities and differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, off to glue flowers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27800,"nextTopicId":27967}}
