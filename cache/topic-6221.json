This <br/>\nis something dd does quite often, questions why a certain word is <br/>\nspelled the way it is.  She&#39;s considered a &quot;poor speller&quot; by school <br/>\nstandards (because she can&#39;t figure it out phonetically or when <br/>\nwriting, she often leaves out letters, ends of words etc).   Yet she <br/>\nhas the most amazing vocabulary.  This was one of the problem, IMO, <br/>\nin school, is that when she was able to express what she knew <br/>\nVERBALLY, she was so &quot;ON&quot;; when she tested or wrote something, it <br/>\nlooked like someone else, much younger had done the work.  They <br/>\ndidn&#39;t actually say this often, but I know they felt she just needed <br/>\nto try harder, make more of an effort (to do what?  write it <br/>\nperfectly?   I tried so hard to get them to allow her to &quot;test&quot; <br/>\nverbally, but gave up once I decided we would be homeschooling).  She <br/>\nneeds to form a visual picture of a word, needs to see it, &quot;hold&quot; it, <br/>\nembrace it, feel it, if you will.  Once the picture is in her mind, <br/>\nit&#39;s PERMANENT.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I just think about what it&#39;s like to see the world without being <br/>\n </span></blockquote>forced to read!!

First though, cool things about non-readers:<br/>\n           ~they see things other people DON&#39;T see because while <br/>\nwe&#39;re reading signs while driving (you can&#39;t NOT read once you are <br/>\nable) they don&#39;t see words, they see colors, clouds, plants, <br/>\ninteresting people etc.... They literally SEE the world differently. <br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\n           ~they THINK differently than a reader. They are able to <br/>\npuzzle things out, memorize shapes, colors and signs that have <br/>\nnothing to do with words, in order to get the information they need. <br/>\nFor example, Jared had literally memorized the capabilities of many, <br/>\nmany, MANY Yu-gi-oh cards. He knew them by their pictures. He has <br/>\nplayed extremely difficult games like Dungeons and Dragons all <br/>\nwithout reading. Again....amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\n           ~they often use drawing as a form of expression quite <br/>\nsufficiently, because they don&#39;t have the words to use yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n           ~they think (at least in Jareds case) very logically <br/>\nabout the whole reading/writing issue; &quot;Why on earth is that word <br/>\nspelled like this, it doesn&#39;t make ANY sense&quot;...which leads to a <br/>\ndiscussion on entymology and a bit of research in that area to help <br/>\nexplain the roots of the word....which could lead to a discussion <br/>\nabout other languages, culture, the evoluation of language etc.... <br/>\n(or not).  Children that read very young don&#39;t always question the <br/>\nlogic and entymology aspects of language, they might later, but if <br/>\nyou can decode things naturally at 4-6 years old, you probably <br/>\naren&#39;t going to have the same level of critical thought and <br/>\nquestioning. (but then again, that&#39;s just my kids).<br/>\n<br/>\n   I just think about what it&#39;s like to see the world without being <br/>\nforced to read!! Can you even imagine what that&#39;s like? How cool.<br/>\nYeah, it&#39;s a really necessary tool eventually....but I would LOVE to <br/>\nremember what it&#39;s like to see the world through those eyes again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sitting here at my computer and just looking around my HOUSE, I <br/>\nsee words everywhere, and I can&#39;t possibly ignore what they say. I <br/>\ntry to imagine what that&#39;s like, what I might see if I could just <br/>\nsee people and colors and STUFF. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many wonderful things about non-readers, beyond the fact <br/>\nthat they learn through many, many methods that have nothing to do <br/>\nwith reading. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s see:<br/>\n~observing<br/>\n~doing<br/>\n~watching videos, drama productions, concerts, real life<br/>\n~LIVING....there is nothing better for learning than shopping, being <br/>\npart of a family, interacting with you community etc....<br/>\n~and my favorite;  PLAY<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay is the fodder for genius, it is the stuff from which greatness <br/>\nis born. Play is not only devalued and ignored in our society, it is <br/>\nlooked down on!! <br/>\nPlay is what Einstein was doing when he came up with new formulas <br/>\nand equations. Play is what Benjamin Franklin was doing when he <br/>\npondered and puzzled and tried to find answers. Play is what led <br/>\nEdison to patent hundreds of inventions.<br/>\nPLAY.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you read about Franklin in childhood, he was mucking about with a <br/>\nkite down by a lake as a child (I believe around 11y.o.) and was <br/>\ncurious about the wind and weather. He stripped down, got the kite <br/>\nin the air and laid in the lake while flying the kite to try and <br/>\nunderstand how the wind moved across the water.<br/>\nCan you see a parent trying to understand why on earth their child <br/>\nis laying naked in a lake flying a kite!!!<br/>\nBut that kind of &quot;useless&quot; play led to great things later in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child is fascinated with something, you must TRUST that it is <br/>\nimportant learning going on....whether it&#39;s an obsession with <br/>\ntrains, dirt or spongebob.  Their interests, fascinations and <br/>\nseemingly simply mucking about is important learning.<br/>\nIt may not look like much today, but it IS important.<br/>\nTrust that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust that books are only ONE way to learn. Trust that children will <br/>\nlearn in a million ways without reading. Just trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6222,"nextTopicId":5944}}
