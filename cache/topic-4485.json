It all depends on which side of the  fence you&#39;re <br/>\nstanding on!<br/>\n <br/>\nSome people will come on and say that everyone seems to live in the city  <br/>\nwith all the museums and zoos and opportunities; how do you unschool when you  <br/>\nlive rurally? Someone in the city will ask how can you unschool without a farm  <br/>\nand animals and rows and rows of corn? Then there&#39;s the suburbite!   She  <br/>\ncomplains that the city-dwellers have the great stuff and the farmers  have the <br/>\ngreat stuff, but what&#39;s SHE supposed to do???? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nMany of us are ex-teachers, many have no college degree at all! Some have  <br/>\nPhD&#39;s; some GED&#39;s. The only requirements to unschool are a love of learning, a  <br/>\npositive attitude, a willingness to look things up and do new things, passion, <br/>\n and the trust of and respect of your children. (There may be a few more  <br/>\nthat someone will throw in there!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and I dont know or understand a  lot.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m guessing you know and understand your children.

It has loads of frugal ideas :) There is<br/>\nanother book I found at Barnes and Noble<br/>\n&quot;Carschooling&quot;. It&#39;s great.

If you have no<br/>\nidea admit it and offer to help them find the answer.<br/>\nI believe it is more important to teach our kids how<br/>\nto learn for themselves. Is it really that important<br/>\nthat they know all the capitals or that they could<br/>\nfind them on a map if they needed to.
