I did not allow my hubby to have pop or his cookies in the house. he is a runner and burn LOTS of calories so he need them ( lol).<br/>\nI did that because if there was any in the house and my ds wanted it  just felt wrong to say no to him. I felt it was him choice and I should respect it. That was before I knew anything about unschooling.<br/>\nWhen he was about 2 and a half I was more relaxed but still did not want to have pop in the house. He could have it with daddy when he was out in the farm or he saw it somewhere and asked for it.<br/>\nSo every time he was out he wanted one and drank lots of it. At that time I found this list and AU and started reading about unschooling your whole life.<br/>\nIt all made so much sense that I finally let go and we stated buying his pop and having it in the refrigerator. The first couple of months he drank  a lot ( well maybe the most 3 a day). But now he rarely does ( maybe one a week- no kidding)  and he usually opens one to take a sip or tow and that is all he wants. He says he likes to drink water.<br/>\nToday we went to out Health Club and had lunch there. I asked : What do you want to drink: pop, milk or Naked Red Machine? He picked milk and the Naked fruit smoothie. <br/>\nMy sister limits my 5 and almost 3 year old nephews. She keeps the candy and sweets stashed and they know it and there are no sanks available for the kids to go get themselves. Every time I go to her house they want to scavenger my car for sweets or any snacks (even Cheddar Bunnies).  We always have stuff in the car because we may buy a bag and it never gets eaten so it just sits there.

That&#39;s just absolutely false.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of us are smart enough and well informed enough to know the value of <br/>\nprotein, vitamins, minerals or the role of carbohydrates or fiber in a <br/>\nhealthy diet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea is not that nutrition is &quot;all made up&quot; or not important or that all <br/>\nfoods are equal, nutritionally speaking.      The idea behind not <br/>\nclassifying some foods as &quot;junk&quot; and some foods as &quot;good&quot; is that it <br/>\ninterferes with or even prevents a child from making a personal choice. <br/>\nAnd when a child&#39;s psychology is altered by feelings of guilt or shame or a <br/>\ndesire to make mom happy he cannot make personal discoveries about his own <br/>\nfeelings of wellness as they relate to food choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child would like to try a commercially prepared cookie but her mother <br/>\nhas strong feelings that it is &quot;junk,&quot; one or all of several things might <br/>\nhappen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe child may deny herself the cookie, hoping instead to live up to the <br/>\nmom&#39;s ideal of good eating and that does not contribute to her learning <br/>\nabout making good choices for herself.   That is about pleasing mom.   A <br/>\nchild may regret not eating the cookie or feel guilty about even wanting it <br/>\nin the first place.   A child might eat the cookie and feel badly that she&#39;s <br/>\ndisappointed her mom.    All of that is about the mom and the mom&#39;s choices. <br/>\nThe child has no real choice there, to decide for or against the cookie <br/>\nwithout being or feeling judged.   If food is related to feelings of guilt <br/>\nor shame it cannot be easily related to feelings of ill or wellness.  We <br/>\ndon&#39;t learn what foods make us feel good, *physically* if we&#39;re in that <br/>\nstranglehold of guilt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m confident that my child has a good mind and can make good choices.  I <br/>\nhave proof now, after almost fifteen years that he does indeed make good <br/>\nchoices.   He makes good choices because he&#39;s been able to make choices his <br/>\nwhole life.  He&#39;s had lots of help from us but the learning is his, the <br/>\nunderstanding is his.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my hopes for Dylan from the beginning was that he would be confident <br/>\nin his own decision making ability.   I believe one of the ways a child&#39;s <br/>\nconfidence and decision making is undermined by parents is when a child is <br/>\nunder pressure, subtle or overt, to make the choices the parents would make.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a life where there is plenty of wholesome food available and where <br/>\nparents are making good food choices or talking about how they feel after <br/>\neating more than they should have is a learning life.   A life where some <br/>\nfoods are classified as little more than garbage and a decision to eat it <br/>\nanyway brings feelings of shame is a dysfunctional life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only people in my house who have food issues are my husband and myself. <br/>\nWe grew up in families where budget and judgment dictated what we could eat. <br/>\nMy husband, at forty seven still squirrels chocolate away in cubbies and <br/>\ndrawers even though no one else in the house eats milk chocolate, so <br/>\nprecious it is to him he can&#39;t bear to be without it.   Black olives are a <br/>\nstaple in my pantry and I will open and eat a whole can when I&#39;m by myself, <br/>\nthey were rare and limited when I was little.   My son, who can have <br/>\nanything he wants (within my ability to get it for him) does not horde or <br/>\nbinge.  He asked for his favorite kind of cookie Wednesday when we were <br/>\ngoing to watch  a movie and I made them.  He&#39;s had two cookies since <br/>\nWednesday.

I agree 100% with the book. Even though you may <br/>\nbelieve  that kids need to find their own way and should be allowed to do what <br/>\nthey  want, they also need a parent to guide them and to tell them no at times. <br/>\nA  child who is always told &quot;yes&quot; will eventually think thats just the way the <br/>\n world runs.

Or the  parents <br/>\nbehave that way (I&#39;ve seen many people who are like this...why does no  one in <br/>\nmy town put the shopping carts in the corral area of the parking lot????  I <br/>\ndigress &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n <br/>\nThere is permissive parenting (just letting the child do what they  want <br/>\nbecause the parent doesn&#39;t want to get involved) and there is  responsive <br/>\nparenting where the parent is involved and offering guidance and  information in each <br/>\nsituation.  We are advocating responsive  parenting.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids aren&#39;t good at noticing consequences, especially ones that aren&#39;t  <br/>\nright in their face.  So I point them out when it is a good time to do  so.  &quot;If <br/>\nyou leave your scooter in the drive-way, Daddy has to get out of  his car and <br/>\nmove it when he comes home from work&quot;.  After a few times, it  sinks in.  <br/>\nInformation....not threats like &quot;I&#39;ll take your scooter away if  you don&#39;t stop <br/>\nleaving it in the driveway&quot;.  I think the information  suggestion will help my <br/>\nkids continue to understand consequences of  actions.....a good trait that <br/>\nmany adults don&#39;t really have....and the threats  are more focused on how to not <br/>\nget in trouble.  I would rather my kids  learn the skills about how actions <br/>\ncan influence people and things and how to  give other people useful information.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome kids will notice that others are always moving the scooters and will  <br/>\nadjust accordingly without verbal information.

I approached a family we knew who had a <br/>\nBasset and they were happy for Dylan to walk him (or be walked by him ) and <br/>\nhappy to arrange times when Dylan could go and play with him and Dylan was <br/>\nhappy to look after him if his people had to go out of town.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also called my sister, who had Basset hounds many years ago, before Dylan <br/>\nwas born, and asked if she&#39;d tell Dylan about her dogs.  She wrote letters <br/>\nto Dylan, sent pictures of her dogs and shared stories about the crazy <br/>\nthings they did.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout me saying &quot;no&quot; Dylan came to understand there were real reasons it <br/>\nwould be difficult to have a Basset hound as part of our family AND his need <br/>\nto have some experience with Basset hounds was fulfilled.   That wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave happened for him if I had said. &quot;No.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***What happens to an adult in a real-life situation when he/she is told<br/>\nknow and doesn&#39;t know how to react?***<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are few if any scenarios in which an American could grow to adulthood <br/>\nand never hear &quot;no&quot; or understand the concept of &quot;no.&quot;   That&#39;s because <br/>\nthere are natural limits to what humans can do.   We all find that out <br/>\nsooner than we like - when we want to get our own glass from a cupboard <br/>\nthree feet above our tallest, tippy toe stretch.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens when parents find ways to say &quot;yes&quot; even in naturally limiting <br/>\nsituations is a child learns how to problem solve, how to think in new ways, <br/>\nhow to clarify what it is they do want and then what steps to take so that <br/>\nthe thing might happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I think that by never telling your child &quot;no&quot; you ar eonly creating <br/>\nproblems<br/>\nfor later down the road. I agree 100% with the book. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the possibility of &quot;never telling a child &quot;no,&quot; &quot; is pretty slim. <br/>\nParents will sometimes not have the money for a piano or a new bike or a <br/>\ntrip to the ocean.  That&#39;s the reality of life.   What unschoolers try to do <br/>\nis avoid the arbitrary &quot;NO.&quot;   The &quot;no&#39;s&quot; that come from not thinking well <br/>\nor carefully, the &quot;no&#39;s&quot; that come from not being interested enough in what <br/>\nour kids want, the &quot;no&#39;s &quot; that come from not wanting to be inconvenienced <br/>\nby our kids.<br/>\nSo their might not be money for a piano but there might be a used keyboard <br/>\nin the right price range.  Or, there might be a piano at the community <br/>\ncenter or church or a friend&#39;s house and arrangements might be made to go <br/>\nplay.   If a new bike is not in the budget maybe fixing and repainting an <br/>\nold bike is.  Maybe there&#39;s a bike for sale and the owner would take <br/>\ninstallments.   If a trip to the ocean is not possible maybe a trip to a <br/>\nlake with a beach is possible, or a walk along the river, or exploring in a <br/>\nstream.   Maybe a day at the pool would fulfill the need for big water <br/>\nadventure.   Many times a solution can be found, a way to say &quot;yes&quot; can be <br/>\nfound, if a parent is willing to listen to what a child really wants and to <br/>\nthink in creative ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No&quot; shuts down communication, limits possibilities and creates bad <br/>\nfeelings.  It should be avoided whenever possible.  Unschooling should be <br/>\nvery much about communicating well with our kids, finding more possibilities <br/>\nfor them to live in a big world and building a close relationship with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Even though you may believe that kids need to find their own way and <br/>\nshould be allowed to do what they want,***<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one here has EVER said that.  Kids should not have to and do not need to <br/>\nfind their own way.  Kids need our full attention and involvement in their <br/>\nlives in the most thoughtful and dedicated ways.   Neglect has NOTHING to do <br/>\nwith a child being helped to achieve his goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome links that will help your understanding of unschooling:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschool/definition.html\">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/definition.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/freedom\">http://sandradodd.com/freedom</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/rules\">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/yes\">http://sandradodd.com/yes</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/respect\">http://sandradodd.com/respect</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/mindfulness\">http://sandradodd.com/mindfulness</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":133390932,"authorName":"Mara","from":"Mara &lt;mamadeluz@...&gt;","profile":"mamadeluz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Kids need to hear NO from parents/food","postDate":"1168101871","msgId":20307,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDcwMTA2MTY0NDMxLjc4NTI0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzMjA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNTgwMWM3MzE1MiQxYWNjMTQ5MCQ2NDU4YThjMEBPZmZpY2U+"},"prevInTopic":20305,"nextInTopic":20308,"prevInTime":20306,"nextInTime":20308,"topicId":20275,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Same here, Both my 2 and 5 y.o. can eat whatever whenever they want.

My daughter<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have it in the house. You don&#39;t eat it yourself. Outside of that, healthy modeling and availability, you provide lots of healthy foods your child likes and the junk will be limited on its own. If you didn&#39;t start this from the time they are little, then you will be faced with a choice between controlling your childs food and letting go. I would choose the letting go. Some folks feel not purchasing junk food is controlling and disrespectful of the child, but in our house food that isn&#39;t nutritional doesn&#39;t get purchased with our extrememly tight budget. If we are out and the kids want an icecream sandwich, a lollipop, snack food, we buy as long as the money is there. But we do not have this stuff in the house where the choices are then about allowing free access or controlling food. I don&#39;t categorize junk food as &quot;food&quot; actually. Its full of antinutrients, so I feel no obligation to allocate food stamps to buying it. Others disagree with me. <br/>\nI don&#39;t put junk food in my body because after recovering from a life threatening illness in my early twenties and seeing the poor health of most of my extended family, I don&#39;t buy the often promoted belief within the unschooling community that nutrition is all made up. People can eat as much junk as they want and they will self regulate and be healthy. I don&#39;t see this as a health care provider, as a parent who interacts with lots of other kids, as someone who was a nanny for over a decade or as someone who took part in raising siblings who are now teens. Kids are developing organs and organ systems. That is way different than having healthy ones already in place to handle high glycemic loads or to detox junk food.<br/>\nI do however agree that having rules, controls and stress around food is absolutely detrimental to the parent child relationship and also to the childs internal response to food itself. If you have your fridge and cabinets full od soda, candy, snack food and stuff then you have created the situation where you need to hold your tongue and allow your child to regulate himself. Or engage in constant battles and nnegotiation around food which I have done with other kids and hated. <br/>\nMy kids are still young, and they may shift to the degree that we have to change what we are doing, but for now it has been no problem to simply not have this stuff around, to allow unfettered access when it is and their diet has a very very small percentage of junk. <br/>\nI think we all have to be extrememly careful about an approach like this because the line is super sketchy between contolling access to food in an unhealthy wayand what I am describing. Kids have to be part of the dialogue and conversation as soon as they are able. It also helps if the place you are shopping is full of healthy choices for them to make, as our food co-op is.<br/>\nhth,<br/>\ncarrie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Kids need to hear NO from parents/food","postDate":"1168091946","msgId":20298,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVubzl2YStjMW1rQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDcwMTA1MjIwOTE0Ljk2NjIzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxNzA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20295,"nextInTopic":20301,"prevInTime":20297,"nextInTime":20299,"topicId":20275,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Meridith, How old is your daughter and how long have you been unschooling?
