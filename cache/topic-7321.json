Especially at the beginning. Here&#39;s a piece of an unschooling talk I gave once about this very thing:<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were times, especially during that first year of unschooling that it seemed that at least once a month I was certain that unschooling was not the way for us. It was a failure. It was not working. Stuff was getting in the way. The kids were bored or I was cranky or the TV was bugging the heck out of me. That of course meant that they weren�t learning anything, they would never learn anything and this whole unschooling experiment was a BIG failure!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it would pass, as cycles naturally do. And just as naturally my children would emerge with a newfound passion, a particularly insightful question or a great new interest to pursue. Suddenly unschooling was working again. Imagine that. And as I began to get a feel for this rhythm of our natural days and nights and weeks and months, I could see that it was NOT the unschooling that was the problem. It was any number of normal, natural life occurrences.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for awhile, I had a sign that I put up on my mirror that said �It�s NOT the unschooling, it�s ___________ and then I would fill in the blank. It�s not the unschooling, it�s P.M.S. (That was a big one, thus the once a month nature of my panic attacks.) or It�s not the unschooling, it�s flu season. Or it�s not the unschooling it�s time for the in-laws to visit. (Another biggie.) After I filled in enough different variations, I realized that I really needed only one sign to remind me what it�s all about. It�s not the unschooling, it�s LIFE.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find yourself getting stressed and doubtful you might want to create your own sign, with your own understanding of what will fill in your stress blanks. Perhaps it�s a pregnancy, a nursing toddler or a fearful 7-year-old. These are all occurrences in the natural path of our life cycles. We can let them get in the way and use them as an excuse, or we can flow with them, around them and through them. Part of life is about accepting those things that just ARE. Things happen. But it doesn�t mean that our kids are suddenly unable to learn. It just means that life is happening. And when life happens, learning happens too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I was able to see this as True, I was able to more comfortably stay on this path even when it seemed to be turning in ways I didn�t expect, trusting that it was leading me to where my family needed to be. If one day or week or even month seemed to be caught in a lull of activity or groundswell of boredom, the next was just as likely to be bathed in activity and interest. <br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the<br/>\ngreen earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly<br/>\nalive.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175529137,"authorName":"Donald and Sandra Winn","from":"Donald and Sandra Winn &lt;aplan4life@...&gt;","profile":"aplan4life","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Heartbroken","postDate":"1130878627","msgId":7384,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTAxMjA1NzA3LjMyNjUxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzMDE1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGExLjZhZjJkMjM4LjMwOTkwOTNkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":7376,"nextInTopic":7394,"prevInTime":7383,"nextInTime":7385,"topicId":7321,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kathryn, thank you....

That <br/>\n&gt; said, there were aspects of unschooling that she<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t entirely get.  <br/>\n&gt; Periodically, she would get into some concern about<br/>\n&gt; Julian&#39;s not doing academic  <br/>\n&gt; work. When we asked what exactly she thought he was<br/>\n&gt; missing out on, she said,  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;oh, like making dioramas.&quot;  It kind of became a<br/>\n&gt; family joke, because we  all <br/>\n&gt; knew damn well that she wasn&#39;t really concerned<br/>\n&gt; about dioramas.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; One week at Sunday school, julian made a diorama<br/>\n&gt; based on a Farside cartoon  <br/>\n&gt; he&#39;d seen, and solemnly presented it to Beth, who<br/>\n&gt; joked back, &quot;Now, was that <br/>\n&gt; so  hard?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; These days, Beth, who works for a Girl Scout<br/>\n&gt; council, has been known to  <br/>\n&gt; challenge school administrators and directors of<br/>\n&gt; youth organizations on how much  <br/>\n&gt; respect and listening they do with kids. I suspect<br/>\n&gt; some of them quake in fear  <br/>\n&gt; when she approaches.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; What I&#39;m trying to tell you is that he doesn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; to totally get it yet.  <br/>\n&gt; There will be times, as new unschoolers, where<br/>\n&gt; either of you will have panic  <br/>\n&gt; attacks and those fears &quot;OHMYGOD! What am I doing to<br/>\n&gt; my child&#39;s life????&quot;   <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s best when only one parent is crazy at a time.<br/>\n&gt; But it&#39;s okay. Julian is 16  <br/>\n&gt; now, and at a time when most traditional parents<br/>\n&gt; find they worry more, I worry  <br/>\n&gt; very little about how he will turn out. (he&#39;s worked<br/>\n&gt; out very well,  <br/>\n&gt; actually.)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Ask him to just come to you if he has concerns. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; clear that he trusts  <br/>\n&gt; you, he&#39;s just very confused. Keep him in the loop.<br/>\n&gt; Brag about the cool things  <br/>\n&gt; your kids know. Let him know that it&#39;s going to be<br/>\n&gt; hard for the kids to answer <br/>\n&gt;  &quot;How is the math or science going?&quot; -- not because<br/>\n&gt; they aren&#39;t learning any, <br/>\n&gt; but  because they don&#39;t separate it like that. YOU<br/>\n&gt; can tell him how the math <br/>\n&gt; is  going, and your husband will learn to see it<br/>\n&gt; too. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; From what you&#39;ve said, it sounds like it will be<br/>\n&gt; fine. I worry much more  <br/>\n&gt; about the folks whose partners start making laws<br/>\n&gt; about what the kids have to  <br/>\n&gt; learn, etc. That never seems good for the<br/>\n&gt; relationship or the kids.

Although I truly do<br/>\n&gt; not believe DH truly  &quot;get&#39;s it&quot; afterall, it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; bad as I thought.  This morning I  asked him, &quot;When<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; have some spare time tonight could you please sit <br/>\n&gt; down<br/>\n&gt; and read the journals that I&#39;ve been doing?

I love unschooling and I&#39;m not  sure you<br/>\n&gt; understand but when I let Brooke know that we have<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; do some  &quot;school&quot; things, she started crying.&quot;  He<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; replied, &quot;Why did you  tell her that?  All I did was<br/>\n&gt; ask Zak how his reading, math and  science were<br/>\n&gt; going?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Then I said,&quot;But honey, some days he reads for <br/>\n&gt; hours<br/>\n&gt; and sometimes he doesn&#39;t read at all...just like we<br/>\n&gt; adults  do.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; About this time, he had to get off to work so the<br/>\n&gt; conversation  ended.  He doesn&#39;t want to read the<br/>\n&gt; journal, yet I can tell that he  still thinks<br/>\n&gt; schoolish.  Again, his MAIN concern is for 11yo  ds,<br/>\n&gt; not 7yo dd.  DD inquires all the time, constantly<br/>\n&gt; does<br/>\n&gt; math  type things but does not like doing math<br/>\n&gt; worksheets, she is active and  always busy, even<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s watching tv she is doing &quot;something&quot;,  loves<br/>\n&gt; animals, clouds, sunrises, etc.    <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As much as I am  starting to see steps in<br/>\n&gt; unschooling,<br/>\n&gt; I believe that DH is fearful.   When I was excited<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; Zak that he had made a math game with shapes, DH <br/>\n&gt; saw<br/>\n&gt; no big deal.  He sees that as simple, whereas ds<br/>\n&gt; used<br/>\n&gt; to be  doing heavy Abeka math.  It was a struggle<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; there were tears but DH  does not like this math at<br/>\n&gt; all, he isn&#39;t seeing it helping an 11yo.   He does<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; see math in dice, dot, paper math games...especially<br/>\n&gt; with an  11 yo.  When he sees 7yo doing that and<br/>\n&gt; more,<br/>\n&gt; he sees 11yo as behind  and is very very concerned<br/>\n&gt; about it.  We have that math literature  form the<br/>\n&gt; guy<br/>\n&gt; that can do numbers in his head real fast, dh<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; care  whether or not we do math workbooks, but told<br/>\n&gt; ds<br/>\n&gt; that he should learn one  math trick a week from<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; book.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve tried to point out that DS  needs to learn to<br/>\n&gt; love<br/>\n&gt; learning because all he ever had was formal, and  DH<br/>\n&gt; says &quot;okay&quot; but then as time goes by and he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; see things  happening his fears about ds grow .  Dd<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry to &quot;compare&quot; but  I am only doing this<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; you guys here.  Her vocabulary is more  extensive,<br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt; is well-spoken, charismatic, she loves math, loves<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; do  art, asks for spellings of one or more words a<br/>\n&gt; day,<br/>\n&gt; etc.  Ds, even  though we&#39;ve had progress, seems<br/>\n&gt; behind<br/>\n&gt; his sister and I know that this is  causing the<br/>\n&gt; fear. <br/>\n&gt; I do not know what comforting words to say to my dh.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Much of this probably has to do with the fact that<br/>\n&gt; much is expected in  our society from boys to get<br/>\n&gt; out,<br/>\n&gt; get a job, have a family.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has anyone here ever been in a situation where a<br/>\n&gt; younger child  &quot;seems&quot; brighter and more advanced<br/>\n&gt; than<br/>\n&gt; an older sibling?

That <br/>\nsaid, there were aspects of unschooling that she didn&#39;t entirely get.  <br/>\nPeriodically, she would get into some concern about Julian&#39;s not doing academic  <br/>\nwork. When we asked what exactly she thought he was missing out on, she said,  <br/>\n&quot;oh, like making dioramas.&quot;  It kind of became a family joke, because we  all <br/>\nknew damn well that she wasn&#39;t really concerned about dioramas.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne week at Sunday school, julian made a diorama based on a Farside cartoon  <br/>\nhe&#39;d seen, and solemnly presented it to Beth, who joked back, &quot;Now, was that <br/>\nso  hard?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nThese days, Beth, who works for a Girl Scout council, has been known to  <br/>\nchallenge school administrators and directors of youth organizations on how much  <br/>\nrespect and listening they do with kids. I suspect some of them quake in fear  <br/>\nwhen she approaches.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I&#39;m trying to tell you is that he doesn&#39;t have to totally get it yet.  <br/>\nThere will be times, as new unschoolers, where either of you will have panic  <br/>\nattacks and those fears &quot;OHMYGOD! What am I doing to my child&#39;s life????&quot;   <br/>\nIt&#39;s best when only one parent is crazy at a time. But it&#39;s okay. Julian is 16  <br/>\nnow, and at a time when most traditional parents find they worry more, I worry  <br/>\nvery little about how he will turn out. (he&#39;s worked out very well,  <br/>\nactually.)<br/>\n <br/>\nAsk him to just come to you if he has concerns. It&#39;s clear that he trusts  <br/>\nyou, he&#39;s just very confused. Keep him in the loop. Brag about the cool things  <br/>\nyour kids know. Let him know that it&#39;s going to be hard for the kids to answer <br/>\n &quot;How is the math or science going?&quot; -- not because they aren&#39;t learning any, <br/>\nbut  because they don&#39;t separate it like that. YOU can tell him how the math <br/>\nis  going, and your husband will learn to see it too. <br/>\n <br/>\nFrom what you&#39;ve said, it sounds like it will be fine. I worry much more  <br/>\nabout the folks whose partners start making laws about what the kids have to  <br/>\nlearn, etc. That never seems good for the relationship or the kids. It doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nsound like he&#39;s doing that, though.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n <br/>\n********************<br/>\n <br/>\nIn a message dated 11/1/2005 9:50:18 AM Eastern Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks  for the input everyone.

He came home<br/>\nfrom lunch today and started grilling 11yo ds.  How&#39;s<br/>\nyour reading coming, done any science, what about<br/>\nmath?  I just wanted to cry and scream at the same<br/>\ntime.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess he understands not doing everything the school<br/>\ndoes and that it is interest led but he still expects<br/>\nsubjects to be covered.  Deep down I felt like he<br/>\nstill didn&#39;t understand and today those feelings were<br/>\nconfirmed.  The last thing I wanted to do is argue<br/>\nduring lunch with him and I still don&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s such a great husband and father.  A few positives<br/>\nhave happened from me letting loose the reigns on him<br/>\nand our marriage has been happier and he has been<br/>\neasier on Zak in other areas.  I think he believes<br/>\nthat children need to do the subjects though, and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think he&#39;ll budge.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like it&#39;s back to relaxed/ecletic for awhile,<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what else to do.  Boy, do I feel stupid<br/>\nfor offering my advice to others now, good think I<br/>\nmade clear that we were newbies to unschooling. <br/>\nUnschooling is where my heart is at and having<br/>\nexperienced it and having received such wonderful and<br/>\nwisdom filled advice has changed how I look at things<br/>\nregardless of if we have to do a few &quot;schoolish&quot;<br/>\nlooking things.  Never again will I yell at my son we<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t get it.  For history and such we&#39;ll just<br/>\nkeep it to reading, do fun experiments, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to write that with a smile but really, all<br/>\nI feel like doing right now is balling my eyes out.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nStart your day with Yahoo! - Make it your home page! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\">http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7442,"nextTopicId":7461}}
