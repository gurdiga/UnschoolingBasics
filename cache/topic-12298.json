And I had to muck about all on my own to figure it out.;) <br/>\nThe full story, is that we had the MOST awesome Raspberry Mojito&#39;s in<br/>\nAlaska last summer. I was eating out at a fancy restaraunt in<br/>\nAnchorage with my sisters and everything was AMAZING!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI vowed to figure out how to make the Mojito&#39;s after the bartender<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t give up the recipe. I think I came pretty close after mucking<br/>\nabout with some basic Mojito recipes on the internet. Here&#39;s what I<br/>\ncame up with:<br/>\n<br/>\nFresh (or frozen thawed) raspberries<br/>\nFresh mint<br/>\nTonic water (club soda)<br/>\n1oz. simple syrup<br/>\nJuice from 1/2 lime<br/>\n1oz. Raspberry Rum<br/>\n<br/>\nMake the simple syrup by boiling 3cups water with 3cups sugar for long<br/>\nenough that the amount is reduced by 1/2. Bottle and keep in refer.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrush a small handful of mint and place in bottom of glass (tall,<br/>\nskinny glasses are nice), pour the lime juice and syrup over and smush<br/>\nit about to help the mint flavor escape.:)<br/>\nPut some ice in glass, add raspberries, Rum and enough tonic water to<br/>\nfill glass (about 3/4 cup?).<br/>\n<br/>\nServe with friends and laughter....<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12296,"nextTopicId":12303}}
