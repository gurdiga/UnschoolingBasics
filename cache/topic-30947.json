But even <br/>\nso, I&#39;d try to remember that way of thinking is for the schools not <br/>\nreal life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just trying to help you get past the stage where you feel like <br/>\nyour kids are just playing and not learning.  When I began <br/>\nunschooling, I stopped using a schedule but left all our school <br/>\nbooks on the shelves.  I expected my children to happily work <br/>\nthrough academic subjects because they were choosing what subject to <br/>\ndo and when to do it.  I was still thinking that math had to be <br/>\nconquered with a program, history had to be contained all in one <br/>\nresource to understand, writing would be more interesting if they <br/>\ncould choose their topics, etc.  I was still viewing our daily lives <br/>\nas being broken into schooly components.  But I finally realized <br/>\nthat none of that was real life.  They didn&#39;t see me working through <br/>\nmath books, reading history books (well, sometimes they did, but it <br/>\nwas good books and not dry textbooks), or writing essays or <br/>\njournaling on a daily basis.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have always had resources around such as maps on the walls, a <br/>\nglobe within reach, a wooden U.S. puzzle, a states & capitals card <br/>\ngame, a placemat with all the U.S. Presidents on it, counting <br/>\nposters, multiplication posters, multiplication war card game and <br/>\nlots of books just to name some.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSince you have a map on the wall they like to look at, maybe you can <br/>\nmake little tags for it.  Cut out a small circle, the size of a <br/>\nquarter, draw a picture of Nemo on it, put tape on the back and <br/>\nstick it on Australia.  We had a map with lots of tags from books we <br/>\nwere reading.  If we read a book that took place in a fantasy land, <br/>\nwe put the tag outside the wall map border.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too have to deal with depression and anxiety, so I can understand <br/>\nwhat it&#39;s like.  If the kids are in the mood for a read-aloud, I <br/>\nmight suggest something like Dr. Seuss, Junie B. Jones, or <br/>\nBerenstain Bears.  My kids are 9 and 11 and still absolutely love <br/>\nhearing those books!  It&#39;s hard to feel depressed when I&#39;m reading <br/>\nany of those.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of this helped.  I&#39;m transitioning back into unschooling <br/>\nfor the 3rd time in 5 years.  Each time I let more mind-junk go, and <br/>\nif I do fall back into schooly things it&#39;s been less and less of <br/>\nit.  We did schooly type work over the past 9 months, for example, <br/>\nbut not at all the way the work was intended to be done.  Rather, <br/>\nthe material was a jumping off place for us to find interesting <br/>\nthings.  It&#39;s been a slow journey but I can look back and see huge <br/>\nchanges in our thinking and behaviors over the years.  I also love <br/>\nto read and can recommend many of the books normally seen on these <br/>\nlists.<br/>\n<br/>\nParenting a Free Child: An Unschooled Life by Rue Kream<br/>\nThe Unschooling Unmanual from The Natural Child Project<br/>\nHomeschooling Our Children Unschooling Ourselves by Alison McKee<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the ones I&#39;ve finished recently and love them all!<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: trusting your child,need some reasurance!","postDate":"1205747303","msgId":30997,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMyQTM1MDk1LTI4QkUtNDA4OS1BRDE0LTM2OEVGRkU3MzJBOEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZyazk4bisydHQzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZyazk4bisydHQzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30993,"nextInTopic":30998,"prevInTime":30996,"nextInTime":30998,"topicId":30947,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I know a zillion people who work <br/>\nin the movie industry, television, theater, and video games - <br/>\nperformers and technical people. I mean, seriously, the MAJORITY of <br/>\npeople I know have a connection to the entertainment industry. Even my <br/>\nhusband, who is an economist for the electricity company, deals with <br/>\nthe entertainment industry - it is such a huge industry here that <br/>\ntheir electricity use is major. Heck, even I, myself, recently took a <br/>\npart-time job as the box office manager at a theater. And, then there <br/>\nare the people who work at the theme parks - ride-operators and <br/>\nconcession sellers are the entry-level jobs, but I also know the <br/>\nperson who takes care of the horses at Disneyland, a lighting designer <br/>\nfor their shows, dancers and actors, a drummer in a band, and tour <br/>\nguides and much more.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ,a child can play for their whole life and have no<br/>\n&gt; concept of making a living or what adults do when they go to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you know any like that or are you making up worst case scenarios in <br/>\nyour head? I don&#39;t know one single always-unschooled young adult like <br/>\nthat - grown up with no concept of making a living or what adults do <br/>\nat work? Not a ONE. By FAR the opposite - the unschooled older teens <br/>\nand young adults I know are much MORE aware of the world of careers <br/>\nand work than kids in high school or even in college (who seem to live <br/>\nin their own very limited world).<br/>\n<br/>\nPLAY their whole life? Let&#39;s hope. Lots of the people I know have <br/>\nturned their &quot;play&quot; into careers. One of my daughters (I&#39;ll write <br/>\nabout her job, below) even majored in &quot;Recreation and Leisure Studies&quot; <br/>\nin college.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Most<br/>\n&gt; places don&#39;t allow you to bring your kids to work, and if they have no<br/>\n&gt; interest they won&#39;t want to see it anyway!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe not at 10 or even 13 or 15 years old - but big changes happen in <br/>\nthe late teens. Don&#39;t be in such a hurry.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since I am feeling a real need of &quot;proof of unschooling&quot;, can someone<br/>\n&gt; tell me about adult unschoolers and what they have gone on to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nRoya is 23. Unschooled. She spent her childhood making collages, <br/>\nwatching tv, playing pretend games with her sisters and friends, <br/>\nsinging, making up stories, playing dolls, cutting and pasting and <br/>\ncoloring and drawing and swimming in our pool. She started doing <br/>\nceramics at 14 and kept up a passionate interest in ceramics (throwing <br/>\npots) since. We thought she&#39;d go to college and get an art degree - <br/>\nwhat she really wanted was the studio resources at the college, more <br/>\nthan anything. As a result of her interest in ceramics, she became <br/>\nclose to the ceramics instructor, who recommended her for a job at a <br/>\ncompany that makes and sells glazes and clays. She worked in their <br/>\nretail shop. She was 17 or so. After a year or so of doing that full <br/>\ntime (she got so much GREAT experience there - in so many ways I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t even begin to list it all), she decided to go to college more <br/>\nseriously (take general ed courses, etc, whereas before she&#39;d been <br/>\ntaking almost all fine arts classes). She got a job as a lab tech in <br/>\nthe ceramics studio at the college. She took college courses, did her <br/>\nceramics, hung out with friends. She&#39;d always loved the outdoors and <br/>\ntravel. Somewhere in there she&#39;d gone off and traveled all over the <br/>\nUnited States, on her own, for several months - taking busses and <br/>\ntrains, visiting other unschooled kids she&#39;d met at conferences and <br/>\nNot-Back-to-School Camp. We&#39;d done a lot of camping - she&#39;d been an <br/>\nactive Girl Scout all her life. So, she discovered with GLEE, reading <br/>\nthrough the college catalog, that there was a major called <br/>\n&quot;Recreation.&quot; We looked into the kinds of jobs recreation majors ended <br/>\nup with - it included forest ranger jobs and people who organized <br/>\nrecreation programs and therapeutic recreation and all kinds of <br/>\nthings. Roya had always dreamed and talked about running a camp - <br/>\nsomewhere in a mountain forest - for people to explore the fine arts <br/>\nand experience outdoor challenges. She thought of getting a business <br/>\ndegree, to help her with figuring out how to run a camp like that, but <br/>\ndecided to major in recreation when she saw that they had courses <br/>\nspecifically geared to helping her learn to do what she&#39;d dreamed of <br/>\ndoing. In the meantime, she got a job working with mentally disabled <br/>\nyoung adults in a program that offered life-skills help - which <br/>\nincluded helping them develop hobbies and enjoy recreational activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe got her bachelor&#39;s degree and left the next day to spend the <br/>\nsummer working as a forest ranger in the back country of a state park <br/>\nin Alaska. That was an adventure and a half, to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, she came home and looked for another job. She got one giving <br/>\nscience tours to school kids at a big nature center. She worked there <br/>\nfor a while, but it was pretty boring. Then she got a job as the <br/>\nevent/excursion organizer for a nonprofit organization that provides <br/>\nall kinds of services to people with developmental/mental <br/>\ndisabilities. She LOVES working there and it is a really good job - <br/>\npay is good, great benefits, super nice people. She organizes trips - <br/>\neverything from going bowling to going kayaking in the ocean to going <br/>\nto a dude ranch in Arizona to an Alaskan cruise to a rock-climbing <br/>\ntrip. They&#39;re going to London for a week later this year. She goes on <br/>\nall the trips - is in charge of them. She&#39;s awesome at her job - it is <br/>\nperfect for her. She just had a performance review and it was glowing <br/>\n- they gave her a 6% pay increase.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe lives in her own little house with her boyfriend, who also has a <br/>\ndegree in recreation (they met in college). She just bought herself a <br/>\nnew car - a sensible one (2008 Toyota Yaris). She does karate, plays <br/>\ndisc golf, goes swimming. She still does ceramics regularly. She&#39;s <br/>\ndecorated her little house - painted it beautifully and hung her own <br/>\noil paintings. She knits and crochets. She reads and listens to music <br/>\na lot. She watches tv - mostly dvd&#39;s of West Wing and Gilmore Girls, <br/>\nand lots of movies. She hangs out with her sisters and we have lots of <br/>\nextended family get-togethers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - that&#39;s Roya. More or less. I left a lot out, of course. She&#39;s <br/>\nspoken at unschooling conferences - so there are people here who have <br/>\nmet her.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoxana is my 20 year old. She&#39;s an actress - musical theater, mostly, <br/>\nand &quot;making it on Broadway&quot; is her dream. She&#39;s also a literature <br/>\nlover and is very analytically minded. She writes poetry and stories. <br/>\nShe has taken a lot of college courses, all taken because they <br/>\nappealed to her - history, literature, social science courses, mostly. <br/>\nBut she&#39;s also taken some math and science - she LOVED anthropology <br/>\nand off and on considers going into anthropology as a career. She&#39;s <br/>\nhad leads in a number of musicals - she&#39;s good at it. She takes lots <br/>\nof dance, acting, singing related classes. She&#39;s shy, offstage, kind <br/>\nof naturally a timid sort of person. However, she&#39;s taken a HUGE leap <br/>\n- a very very very brave move for her - and gone off to Paris, France, <br/>\nto spend three months in a study-abroad program.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe earned some of the money for the trip by working at Mervyn&#39;s <br/>\ndepartment store. She&#39;s been in France for 5 weeks. It was difficult <br/>\nfor her and she spent some time pretty homesick, even while absolutely <br/>\nLOVING being there. She lives in a tiny apartment on the left bank <br/>\nwith a roommate. Her street is a popular one for little cafes, shops, <br/>\nrestaurants, clubs. She has a pass to the Louvre and goes there all <br/>\nthe time - even if she just has a free hour or two. She&#39;s made friends <br/>\nand has some weekend trips with friends coming up - they&#39;re going to <br/>\nLondon for a weekend and then to Ireland another weekend. The school <br/>\nshe&#39;s with took them to Versailles for a couple of days and to the <br/>\nLoire Valley for a weekend. Right now she&#39;s in Germany with my <br/>\nhusband&#39;s brother and his son, and they&#39;ll be going to Spain tomorrow <br/>\nto spend a week with my husband&#39;s sister and her family for the <br/>\nPersian New Year (my husband is from Iran, originally) - so lots of <br/>\nextended family that Roxana hasn&#39;t ever really even met before. VERY <br/>\nexciting. She&#39;s gotten over her homesickness and is having a blast.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she comes home in May, Roxana is going to live at home again, <br/>\nspend the next year taking more college courses and doing musicals. <br/>\nThen her plan is to transfer to a university - but she&#39;s not 100 <br/>\npercent sure what she wants to do there - too many great choices, <br/>\nshe&#39;s not quite ready to narrow it down. She has time.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosie is 17. She also does dance, musical theater, singing. She <br/>\nwatches a LOT of tv - loves it. A lot of our best discussions are <br/>\ntriggered by tv shows such as Gilmore Girls, West Wing, Friends, etc. <br/>\nShe also spends a lot of time with friends playing games - Magic, the <br/>\nGathering, D&D, and board games. They also play a lot of video games. <br/>\nShe has a black belt in Kung Fu and plays soccer on an AYSO team that <br/>\nplays pretty much year-round. She&#39;s a Girl Scout and working on her <br/>\nGold Award Project - which is called &quot;Martial Arts for All&quot; and is <br/>\nabout making martial arts accessible and available to people with <br/>\ndisabilities. A few years ago, Rosie created a website about <br/>\nhomeschooling (which is mostly photos with captions), as part of her <br/>\njunior girl scout bronze award project. If you want to look at it, it <br/>\nis here: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/pamsoroosh/unschoolingrose/\">http://homepage.mac.com/pamsoroosh/unschoolingrose/</a> <br/>\nindex.html&gt;. Rose has a job at the martial arts studio, teaching Kung <br/>\nFu about 8 to 10 classes per week. She&#39;s also on their demo team. She <br/>\nthinks she might want to own her own dance and/or martial arts studio <br/>\nin the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - that&#39;s the view from this end of homeschooling. No big problems - <br/>\nlots of fun and excitement and success.<br/>\n<br/>\nListing &quot;achievements&quot; and &quot;activities&quot; is kind of misleading. It <br/>\nmakes us look more frenetic than what our life really feels like. We <br/>\nare busy, that&#39;s true. But, yesterday, Rosie and I went in the <br/>\nafternoon to see a musical that a bunch of people we know were in, <br/>\nthen she went and played games with friends until about 1 in the <br/>\nmorning, then she and I sat up and watched sometv together after Cyrus <br/>\nand I had watched the movie, &quot;The Illusionist.&quot; Today she&#39;s going to <br/>\nanother musical with friends, then she&#39;ll be home the rest of the <br/>\nevening. She&#39;s taking a stage makeup class and on Sunday evenings she <br/>\nusually practices on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - there&#39;s a smattering of stuff about grown unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":241586873,"authorName":"k g","from":"k g &lt;barefootmamax4@...&gt;","profile":"barefootmamax4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] trusting your child,need some reasurance!","postDate":"1205699856","msgId":30971,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI0MTgwMC43MDEyNy5xbUB3ZWIzNjUwMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDA3REI3REQ0LTdFMEItNDA0RC1CQTZCLTFEN0NGRENEODYyREBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30970,"nextInTopic":30974,"prevInTime":30970,"nextInTime":30972,"topicId":30947,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Pam!

I know a zillion people who work  <br/>\nin the movie industry, television, theater, and video games -  <br/>\nperformers and technical people. I mean, seriously, the MAJORITY of  <br/>\npeople I know have a connection to the entertainment industry. Even my  <br/>\nhusband, who is an economist for the electricity company, deals with  <br/>\nthe entertainment industry - it is such a huge industry here that  <br/>\ntheir electricity use is major. Heck, even I, myself, recently took a  <br/>\npart-time job as the box office manager at a theater. And, then there  <br/>\nare the people who work at the theme parks - ride-operators and  <br/>\nconcession sellers are the entry-level jobs, but I also know the  <br/>\nperson who takes care of the horses at Disneyland, a lighting designer  <br/>\nfor their shows, dancers and actors, a drummer in a band, and tour  <br/>\nguides and much more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ,a child can play for their whole life and have no<br/>\n&gt; concept of making a living or what adults do when they go to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you know any like that or are you making up worst case scenarios in  <br/>\nyour head? I don&#39;t know one single always-unschooled young adult like  <br/>\nthat - grown up with no concept of making a living or what adults do  <br/>\nat work? Not a ONE. By FAR the opposite - the unschooled older teens  <br/>\nand young adults I know are much MORE aware of the world of careers  <br/>\nand work than kids in high school or even in college (who seem to live  <br/>\nin their own very limited world).<br/>\n<br/>\nPLAY their whole life? Let&#39;s hope. Lots of the people I know have  <br/>\nturned their &quot;play&quot; into careers. One of my daughters (I&#39;ll write  <br/>\nabout her job, below) even majored in &quot;Recreation and Leisure Studies&quot;  <br/>\nin college.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Most<br/>\n&gt; places don&#39;t allow you to bring your kids to work, and if they have no<br/>\n&gt; interest they won&#39;t want to see it anyway!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe not at 10 or even 13 or 15 years old - but big changes happen in  <br/>\nthe late teens. Don&#39;t be in such a hurry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since I am feeling a real need of &quot;proof of unschooling&quot;, can someone<br/>\n&gt; tell me about adult unschoolers and what they have gone on to do?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Roya is 23. Unschooled. She spent her childhood making collages,  <br/>\nwatching tv, playing pretend games with her sisters and friends,  <br/>\nsinging, making up stories, playing dolls, cutting and pasting and  <br/>\ncoloring and drawing and swimming in our pool. She started doing  <br/>\nceramics at 14 and kept up a passionate interest in ceramics (throwing  <br/>\npots) since. We thought she&#39;d go to college and get an art degree -  <br/>\nwhat she really wanted was the studio resources at the college, more  <br/>\nthan anything. As a result of her interest in ceramics, she became  <br/>\nclose to the ceramics instructor, who recommended her for a job at a  <br/>\ncompany that makes and sells glazes and clays. She worked in their  <br/>\nretail shop. She was 17 or so. After a year or so of doing that full  <br/>\ntime (she got so much GREAT experience there - in so many ways I  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t even begin to list it all), she decided to go to college more  <br/>\nseriously (take general ed courses, etc, whereas before she&#39;d been  <br/>\ntaking almost all fine arts classes). She got a job as a lab tech in  <br/>\nthe ceramics studio at the college. She took college courses, did her  <br/>\nceramics, hung out with friends. She&#39;d always loved the outdoors and  <br/>\ntravel. Somewhere in there she&#39;d gone off and traveled all over the  <br/>\nUnited States, on her own, for several months - taking busses and  <br/>\ntrains, visiting other unschooled kids she&#39;d met at conferences and  <br/>\nNot-Back-to-School Camp. We&#39;d done a lot of camping - she&#39;d been an  <br/>\nactive Girl Scout all her life. So, she discovered with GLEE, reading  <br/>\nthrough the college catalog, that there was a major called  <br/>\n&quot;Recreation.&quot; We looked into the kinds of jobs recreation majors ended  <br/>\nup with - it included forest ranger jobs and people who organized  <br/>\nrecreation programs and therapeutic recreation and all kinds of  <br/>\nthings. Roya had always dreamed and talked about running a camp -  <br/>\nsomewhere in a mountain forest - for people to explore the fine arts  <br/>\nand experience outdoor challenges. She thought of getting a business  <br/>\ndegree, to help her with figuring out how to run a camp like that, but  <br/>\ndecided to major in recreation when she saw that they had courses  <br/>\nspecifically geared to helping her learn to do what she&#39;d dreamed of  <br/>\ndoing. In the meantime, she got a job working with mentally disabled  <br/>\nyoung adults in a program that offered life-skills help - which  <br/>\nincluded helping them develop hobbies and enjoy recreational activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe got her bachelor&#39;s degree and left the next day to spend the  <br/>\nsummer working as a forest ranger in the back country of a state park  <br/>\nin Alaska. That was an adventure and a half, to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, she came home and looked for another job. She got one giving  <br/>\nscience tours to school kids at a big nature center. She worked there  <br/>\nfor a while, but it was pretty boring.  Then she got a job as the  <br/>\nevent/excursion organizer for a nonprofit organization that provides  <br/>\nall kinds of services to people with developmental/mental  <br/>\ndisabilities. She LOVES working there and it is a really good job -  <br/>\npay is good, great benefits, super nice people. She organizes trips -  <br/>\neverything from going bowling to going kayaking in the ocean to going  <br/>\nto a dude ranch in Arizona to an Alaskan cruise to a rock-climbing  <br/>\ntrip. They&#39;re going to London for a week later this year. She goes on  <br/>\nall the trips - is in charge of them. She&#39;s awesome at her job - it is  <br/>\nperfect for her. She just had a performance review and it was glowing  <br/>\n- they gave her a 6% pay increase.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe lives in her own little house with her boyfriend, who also has a  <br/>\ndegree in recreation (they met in college). She just bought herself a  <br/>\nnew car - a sensible one (2008 Toyota Yaris). She does karate, plays  <br/>\ndisc golf, goes swimming. She still does ceramics regularly. She&#39;s  <br/>\ndecorated her little house - painted it beautifully and hung her own  <br/>\noil paintings. She knits and crochets. She reads and listens to music  <br/>\na lot. She watches tv - mostly dvd&#39;s of West Wing and Gilmore Girls,  <br/>\nand lots of movies. She hangs out with her sisters and we have lots of  <br/>\nextended family get-togethers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - that&#39;s Roya. More or less. I left a lot out, of course. She&#39;s  <br/>\nspoken at unschooling conferences - so there are people here who have  <br/>\nmet her.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoxana is my 20 year old. She&#39;s an actress - musical theater, mostly,  <br/>\nand &quot;making it on Broadway&quot; is her dream. She&#39;s also a literature  <br/>\nlover and is very analytically minded. She writes poetry and stories.  <br/>\nShe has taken a lot of college courses, all taken because they  <br/>\nappealed to her - history, literature, social science courses, mostly.  <br/>\nBut she&#39;s also taken some math and science - she LOVED anthropology  <br/>\nand off and on considers going into anthropology as a career. She&#39;s  <br/>\nhad leads in a number of musicals - she&#39;s good at it. She takes lots  <br/>\nof dance, acting, singing related classes. She&#39;s shy, offstage, kind  <br/>\nof naturally a timid sort of person. However, she&#39;s taken a HUGE leap  <br/>\n- a very very very brave move for her - and gone off to Paris, France,  <br/>\nto spend three months in a study-abroad program.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe earned some of the money for the trip by working at Mervyn&#39;s  <br/>\ndepartment store. She&#39;s been in France for 5 weeks. It was difficult  <br/>\nfor her and she spent some time pretty homesick, even while absolutely  <br/>\nLOVING being there. She lives in a tiny apartment on the left bank  <br/>\nwith a roommate. Her street is a popular one for little cafes, shops,  <br/>\nrestaurants, clubs. She has a pass to the Louvre and goes there all  <br/>\nthe time - even if she just has a free hour or two. She&#39;s made friends  <br/>\nand has some weekend trips with friends coming up - they&#39;re going to  <br/>\nLondon for a weekend and then to Ireland another weekend. The school  <br/>\nshe&#39;s with took them to Versailles for a couple of days and to the  <br/>\nLoire Valley for a weekend. Right now she&#39;s in Germany with my  <br/>\nhusband&#39;s brother and his son, and they&#39;ll be going to Spain tomorrow  <br/>\nto spend a week with my husband&#39;s sister and her family for the  <br/>\nPersian New Year (my husband is from Iran, originally) - so lots of  <br/>\nextended family that Roxana hasn&#39;t ever really even met before. VERY  <br/>\nexciting. She&#39;s gotten over her homesickness and is having a blast.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she comes home in May, Roxana is going to live at home again,  <br/>\nspend the next year taking more college courses and doing musicals.  <br/>\nThen her plan is to transfer to a university - but she&#39;s not 100  <br/>\npercent sure what she wants to do there - too many great choices,  <br/>\nshe&#39;s not quite ready to narrow it down. She has time.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosie is 17. She also does dance, musical theater, singing. She  <br/>\nwatches a LOT of tv - loves it. A lot of our best discussions are  <br/>\ntriggered by tv shows such as Gilmore Girls, West Wing, Friends, etc.  <br/>\nShe also spends a lot of time with friends playing games - Magic, the  <br/>\nGathering, D&D, and board games. They also play a lot of video games.  <br/>\nShe has a black belt in Kung Fu and plays soccer on an AYSO team that  <br/>\nplays pretty much year-round. She&#39;s a Girl Scout and working on her  <br/>\nGold Award Project - which is called &quot;Martial Arts for All&quot; and is  <br/>\nabout making martial arts accessible and available to people with  <br/>\ndisabilities. A few years ago, Rosie created a website about  <br/>\nhomeschooling (which is mostly photos with captions), as part of her  <br/>\njunior girl scout bronze award project. If you want to look at it, it  <br/>\nis here: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/pamsoroosh/unschoolingrose/\">http://homepage.mac.com/pamsoroosh/unschoolingrose/</a> <br/>\nindex.html&gt;. Rose has a job at the martial arts studio, teaching Kung  <br/>\nFu about 8 to 10 classes per week.  She&#39;s also on their demo team. She  <br/>\nthinks she might want to own her own dance and/or martial arts studio  <br/>\nin the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - that&#39;s the view from this end of homeschooling. No big problems -  <br/>\nlots of fun and excitement and success.<br/>\n<br/>\nListing &quot;achievements&quot; and &quot;activities&quot; is kind of misleading. It  <br/>\nmakes us look more frenetic than what our life really feels like. We  <br/>\nare busy, that&#39;s true. But, yesterday, Rosie and I went in the  <br/>\nafternoon to see a musical that a bunch of people we know were in,  <br/>\nthen she went and played games with friends until about 1 in the  <br/>\nmorning, then she and I sat up and watched sometv together after Cyrus  <br/>\nand I had watched the movie, &quot;The Illusionist.&quot; Today she&#39;s going to  <br/>\nanother musical with friends, then she&#39;ll be home the rest of the  <br/>\nevening. She&#39;s taking a stage makeup class and on Sunday evenings she  <br/>\nusually practices on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - there&#39;s a smattering of stuff about grown unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337544642,"authorName":"carnationsgalore","from":"&quot;carnationsgalore&quot; &lt;addled.homemaker@...&gt;","profile":"carnationsgalore","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: trusting your child,need some reasurance!","postDate":"1205675665","msgId":30957,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZyajhxaCtvanFtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZyaGtjaCtoZTVwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30955,"nextInTopic":30970,"prevInTime":30956,"nextInTime":30958,"topicId":30947,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She has a comic that has been going  <br/>\non for 9 years that started as very much like Pokemon but has evolved  <br/>\ninto something different.

I love Pokemon. I think it is one of my favorite shows. I love Jesse and James and Meowth and their intro song and how they aren&#39;t really bad guys, not really. I love the whole show. I really find it fascinating. Anyhow. There are two posts on unschooling_discussion that are directly about Pokemon and learning: <br/>\n<br/>\nThis first post I wrote: <br/>\n<br/>\nPokemon are amazing! Simon, who has been watching Pokemon since he was 3 and <br/>\nplaying Pokemon on the gameboy since he was 4, has learned absolutely <br/>\namazing things from that relationship. <br/>\n<br/>\nPokemon for the gameboy is an RPG, so there is a story going on, so <br/>\nunderstanding narrative, and a lot of moving around, spatial skills, map <br/>\nreading. Every Pokemon gameboy game, other than Mystery Dungeon and Pokemon <br/>\nRangers (and a couple of racing ones and a tetris like one) start with a <br/>\nchild moving in to a new house and having to set the clock and then go and <br/>\nmeet the professor in the lab next door. The child picks 1 starter pokemon <br/>\nfrom a choice of 3, a leaf pokemon, a fire pokemon and a water pokemon. <br/>\nWhichever one picked changes, a bit, the strategy the player uses. <br/>\n<br/>\nPokemon have weaknesses to other types of pokemon. There are fire, water, <br/>\nleaf, rock, ghost, psychic, ground, electric, and some others that I&#39;m not <br/>\nthinking of at the minute. Whichever type you have can give you an edge over <br/>\nanother type, or may make you weak against their attacks. So rock types are <br/>\nweak against water types. And that knowledge, that relationship <br/>\nunderstanding, helps the player to prepare for the big boss level battles: <br/>\nthe gym battles. Which is so much about strategy and planning. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what kind of learning so far: narrative, spatial skills, map reading, <br/>\nplanning, strategy, logic, reading skills (there is tons of reading in <br/>\npokemon), numeracy (lots of numbers, levelling up your pokemon, how many <br/>\npokemon you&#39;ve collected, money, lots of numbers). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there is the sideways learning. The guy who created pokemon, <br/>\nSatoshi Tajiri, loved to collect insects as a child and Pokemon is sort of <br/>\nborn from that love. So there is a lot of biology involved. Pokemon evolve <br/>\n(which I&#39;m sure is a poor translation from the Japanese for metamorphosis) <br/>\ninto other pokemon, so a Geodude becomes a Graveler becomes a Golem, some of <br/>\nwhich, like Geodude, is just change. But some is clearly moving from a <br/>\nlarval stage through a chrysalis and into an adult form, like caterpie who <br/>\nbecomes metapod (a cocoon) who becomes butterfree. There is also archaeology <br/>\nand evolution as change over time, in that there are ancient type pokemon, <br/>\nand there is usually an archealogical site somewhere in the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other interesting aspects to Pokemon, like you have to be able to <br/>\ntrain your pokemon or they won&#39;t listen to you, so you must have a certain <br/>\nnumber of gym badges to keep your pokemon&#39;s respect when they get to higher <br/>\nlevels. What kind of pokemon are around can change over the course of the <br/>\nday and where you are. If you want to catch &#39;em all, you have to not only <br/>\nknow where they are and have the right pokeballs, but some have to be traded <br/>\nfor with other players with the other game cartridge--the game releases were <br/>\nalways at least as a pair. You get a reference book (the pokedex) to sort <br/>\nout the pokemon you&#39;ve encountered or caught with more information available <br/>\nfrom the ones you&#39;ve caught. You can enter your pokemon in beauty contests <br/>\nin the later versions of the games. And it is a Japanese game, so there are <br/>\nwonderful Japanese specifics, like tatami rooms and open marketplaces and <br/>\nJapanese temples, and Japanese food, and the Japanese love of vitamins and <br/>\nhealth enhancing drinks. <br/>\n<br/>\nI found an interview with Satoshi Tajeri ( <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://users.otenet.gr/~tzelepisk/yc/st.htm#profile)\">http://users.otenet.gr/~tzelepisk/yc/st.htm#profile)</a> where he says, in <br/>\nanswer to the question What does Pokemon bring to the children: Decisively, <br/>\nit&#39;s a different world which would support the children&#39;s hearts. I think <br/>\nevery person feels the different things in this game, but Pokemon is always <br/>\nwith everyone. It&#39;s true. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of Pokemon being a world which would support the children&#39;s <br/>\nhearts. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is another interesting interview with Satoshi Tajeri here: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pokedream.com/pokemon/infocenter/tajiri.php\">http://pokedream.com/pokemon/infocenter/tajiri.php</a> . <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope something there helps. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond post is from Amy Carpenter: <br/>\n<br/>\nTo add a few things to Schuyler&#39;s list: <br/>\n<br/>\nResearching:  there are game guides for every game, big books of game <br/>\ntips and a listing of every Pokemon in the game, complete with their <br/>\nstats, abilities and attacks.  After a few years of practice, my son <br/>\nFisher (9.5) knows how to get every bit of information out of that <br/>\nguide, when he needs it, and knows how to apply it. <br/>\n<br/>\nNaturalistic intelligence:  The way it&#39;s defined by Howard Gardner. <br/>\nEach Pokemon has certain characteristics, and they fit into various <br/>\ncategories.  Pokemon fans understand all the nuances of those, and the <br/>\namount of information they can store in their heads that way (because <br/>\nit fits into categories that are meaningful to them) is amazing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnime and manga:  Pokemon was our introduction into the world of <br/>\nJapanese animation and comics.  We branched out into the very artful <br/>\nMiyazaki movies (My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Howl&#39;s Moving <br/>\nCastle, Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, Nausicaa -- all beautiful), <br/>\nas well as into other manga and anime like Inuyasha and Full Metal <br/>\nAlchemist.  *Lots* of beautiful stories and a cultural range that is <br/>\nquite awe-inspiring. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Math&quot; and &quot;writing&quot;:  Because Fisher has seen so many graphical <br/>\nrepresentations of Pokemon stats in the different guides, he is <br/>\nextremely comfortable creating bar graphs, circle charts and more as <br/>\nhe creates his own characters for various pretend games that he <br/>\ninvents.  It was in the Pokemon guides that he first saw how he wanted <br/>\nhis own descriptions and stats to look, and now he creates lots of <br/>\ncharacters and pretend worlds based on that template. <br/>\n<br/>\nImagination:  I cannot tell you how many pretend Pokemon battles, <br/>\ncontests, races, camp-outs, and parties we&#39;ve had over the years. <br/>\nHundreds, I&#39;m sure.  Hundreds of times that he&#39;s taken this idea of <br/>\nPokemon and worked out his own pretend world, his own ideas about <br/>\nsocial interaction and relationships, his own stories, his own new <br/>\nmoves, his own ideas about what it means to win and lose, his own <br/>\nbattle system, and so on. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I can think of right now.  It does seem that the kids who <br/>\nget into Pokemon *really* get into it, and it adds so much to their <br/>\nlives and their learning.  The creator of Pokemon, Satoshi Tajeri, is <br/>\nsuch an aware observer, and I think that&#39;s why it appeals so deeply to <br/>\nmany kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace, <br/>\nAmy <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=================<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe something there is information that will help you to see the glory that is Pokemon. I would honestly relax and enjoy the ride. Keep offering things, but don&#39;t get worried or upset if they don&#39;t get accepted. Maybe offer more Pokemon oriented things. There are some weird Pokemon homemade videos on youtube (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sr-O6719kM&feature=related\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sr-O6719kM&feature=related</a> --Misty gives &quot;The Trainer&quot; the finger, so it may not be appropriate for all audiences--for example). Maybe watching some of those with your kids will amuse and engage them. See if your library has any Pokemon books. We have a couple, one of which is a Romeo and Juliet retelling. Get on ebay and look for Pokemon figures and strew those around the house. We have a lot from when we lived in Japan and while Simon&#39;s love for them has waned, they are still among my favorite toys. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimon has recently become fascinated with Naruto and I missed the boat a little bit. I don&#39;t have a clue what is going on. Last night he and I watched an episode together and I said I don&#39;t understand. He told me I should watch the first 15 episodes and I&#39;ll understand. I figure I&#39;ll try and do that over the next few days since he so wanted to share it with me. I mean how could I not accept that sweet an invitation?<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/t/cartoons\">http://sandradodd.com/t/cartoons</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: barefootmamax4 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:barefootmamax4@...\">barefootmamax4@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, 15 March, 2008 10:59:29 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] trusting your child,need some reasurance!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe past few days I have been feeling very unsettled about unschooling. <br/>\nI observe my kids playing DS all day, every day.
