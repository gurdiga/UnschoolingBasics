The show was formatted to work for U.S. television, so an hour long<br/>\nshow was 40 minutes on the BBC which doesn&#39;t have commercials (except for <br/>\nitself--like PBS). To fill the 20 minutes difference they used the DVD<br/>\nmaterial called The Planet Earth Diaries, where David Attenborough would <br/>\ntalk about aspects of the filming or the editing. One episode was largely<br/>\nabout Snow Leopards and they had a whole story about mother and son, very <br/>\nlong, very emotive. In the Diaries section they said that they used the<br/>\nfirst footage they got in the last section of the show. So, the artistic <br/>\ndesires of the show beat out the desire to tell the truth, or at least to<br/>\npresent the footage in a linear, true to time, fashion. I kinda thought it <br/>\nwas cool though. I&#39;d never really thought about it. I&#39;ve seen other shows<br/>\ntalk about the fact that they will use captive animals to video those shots <br/>\nthat they couldn&#39;t get the light for in the wild.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that is what the original poster was referring to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that they are often much better about not having grossly <br/>\ninaccurate descriptions of animal behavior.
