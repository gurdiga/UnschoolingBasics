Strewing isn&#39;t about influencing her<br/>\nto do other things or even to seek to look deeper into anything.  It<br/>\nis about providing the resources for her.  And she needs time (a lot<br/>\nof time with school in the mix) to trust that this &quot;strewing&quot; isn&#39;t a<br/>\nguise for &quot;educational learning experience.&quot;  Are you watching tv with<br/>\nher or leaving her to watch alone.  My children have finally figured<br/>\nout that I am rather useless playing video games and that I have a<br/>\nhard time following the story line in many of the games.  That doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlessen their desire for me to sit in the living room while they play.<br/>\nThey don&#39;t mind if I sit and knit or some other hand craft as long as<br/>\nI am interacting with them.  I ask a HUGE amount of (rather silly and<br/>\nsometimes seemingly ditzy) questions and I tend to forget who the good<br/>\nguys are from the bad guys (especially when they have alter egos and<br/>\nhave been controlled by higher forces).<br/>\n<br/>\nTake baby steps in your discovery of unschooling.  YOu may even find<br/>\nyou have to a lot of backtracking and looping over and over since you<br/>\nhave school to deal with.  It&#39;s not going to happen overnight.  Didn&#39;t<br/>\nfor most of us, especially those of us who have had children in school<br/>\nor were very schooly before discovering the &quot;enlightenment of<br/>\nunschooling!&quot;  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":280005589,"authorName":"Solé","from":"=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Sol=E9?= &lt;solelokuai@...&gt;","profile":"solelokua","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"suggestions","postDate":"1158967579","msgId":17541,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2MEUwMDI1LTQ5NEEtNDBGNy1CNUUxLTBGMDRDNzcyNTE1NUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":17546,"prevInTime":17540,"nextInTime":17542,"topicId":17541,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"And another question: I m unsure how to strew and suggest things.
