It seems like you&#39;re inviting a <br/>\nwhole lot of stress to try to avoid some nastiness - and maybe doing <br/>\nmore harm in the long run than the occasional nastiness itself <br/>\nwould. Being well-behaved (as a child or an adult) certainly doesn&#39;t <br/>\nguarantee that other people will be kind or gracious. I&#39;d rather <br/>\ngive my kids the message that &quot;its nice to be considerate, but <br/>\nsometimes people are just grumpy&quot;.

Or maybe *just* do it in the morning <br/>\n*or* the afternoon but not the whole day? <br/>\n<br/>\nI would certainly offer a break in the middle of the day if there <br/>\nwere some reason why the recycling was a whole day affair (I can <br/>\nthink of several, especially with a second kid in the picture) but I <br/>\nalso wouldn&#39;t insist on it if he were so excited as to not want a <br/>\nbreak. In that case, though, I would be really aware that he might <br/>\nnot be at his best in the afternoon and think about ways to help <br/>\nwith that. I might also look for ways to get some small breaks in <br/>\nduring the afternoon - a stop for ice cream comes to mind, or a <br/>\ndetour through a playground. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he is trying to engage with<br/>\n&gt; other children and adults but is not very skilled at it.  So I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>think<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it is hard work for him emotionally and mentally (and even harder <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; me to watch as his approaches are usually quite &quot;inappropriate&quot; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>from<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the pov of the other adult who consider him rude).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How much of an issue is the pov of the other adults - I mean, are <br/>\nthey doing or saying something rude in reply? My experiences with Mo <br/>\nand Ray are that they have both been considered rude by various <br/>\npeople at various times... usually people who think they need to be <br/>\ntaught a lesson about something or other, some well-meaning, even. <br/>\nDepending on the person and situation, I might just be a supportive <br/>\npresence, have a word in my kid&#39;s ear, or tell the adult to back <br/>\noff - either gently or not. Its pretty nuancy and most adults don&#39;t <br/>\nrealize how often children are rude as a reflection of the way <br/>\nadults treat them in the first place. <br/>\n<br/>\nRecently our neighbors had a houseguest who liked to play with Mo, <br/>\nbut also thought he needed to teach her something every time he saw <br/>\nher. Bc Mo has no interest in being &quot;taught&quot; she would be pretty <br/>\nrude to him - well, really, from her pov, he was being obnoxious by <br/>\ntrying to impose some weird agenda on her fun. I tried a few <br/>\ndifferent approaches with him, since Mo would often get frustrated <br/>\nto the point of slapping him, but eventually just stood by my kid - <br/>\nyeah, dude, I&#39;da smacked you, too if you&#39;d done that to me. Not very <br/>\ngentle on my part, but there comes a point where supporting my kid <br/>\nis waaaaay more important than being nice to another grown-up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I expect that my kid is going to have regular interactions with <br/>\na given adult, I&#39;m more likely to go gently and try to foster some <br/>\nunderstanding between that adult and my kid - do more explaining, <br/>\ntranslating, facilitating, distracting... whatever seems appropriate <br/>\nin terms of smoothing things over. I do that at the &quot;swimmin&#39; hole&quot; <br/>\nwe go to, for example, bc its on property shared by several adults, <br/>\nsome of whom prefer &quot;well behaved&quot; children. So I plan on having <br/>\nways to distract Mo when she gets a bit over-the-top, *and* I chat <br/>\nwith some of the less kid-friendly (in my view not theirs) adults <br/>\nwhen things are going smoothly. They may still think my kid is rude, <br/>\nbut she&#39;s not rude in a way that&#39;s going to get her banned from the <br/>\nswimmin&#39; hole, and they feel comfortable with *me* - which is a <br/>\nbigger issue than it might seem. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--the dog thing--<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Because I thought he was<br/>\n&gt; prob quite afraid this time I told him a little about what they do <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; emphasised that they do as the police man says, thinking that a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>little<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; factual knowledge might help normalise it a bit (I could tell it<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t help and I wonder if I should have said nothing at all ? how<br/>\n&gt; cld I have better dealt with this?  We had about 5 together <br/>\n </span></blockquote>minutes in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the car.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sometimes its hard to know when to offer information and when to <br/>\nprovide other kinds of support. I&#39;m fortunate in that Mo will tell <br/>\nme to be quiet when I guess wrong ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nWith Mo I often find that saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry xyz happened&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nsorry that was scary&quot; or whatever, is all she wants to hear. <br/>\nAnything else will push her further into a meltdown. But sometimes a <br/>\nlittle extra information *will* change the way she feels about a <br/>\nsituation, especially if her reaction is based on a misunderstanding <br/>\non her part and I can clear that up quickly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 11.\tWe came in the house, I turned my back to hang up my coat and<br/>\n&gt; immediately DS2 took the water bottle out of DS1s hand.

He just couldn&#39;t deal with one <br/>\nmore thing. That happens. With some kids it happens alot, but I <br/>\nthink most people of all ages experience this now and again. I&#39;ve <br/>\nfallen apart over a sink of dishes just bc it was &quot;the last straw&quot;. <br/>\nGeorge has an entire vocabulary he seems to save for &quot;last straw&quot; <br/>\nmoments (half of which seems to consist of Aaaaarrrrrggghh!). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I just didn&#39;t know what to say or do.

He was <br/>\ncommunicating pretty clearly, considering the circumstances, and you <br/>\nfollowed his cues as best you could. Handling those sorts of <br/>\nsituations depends a whole lot on a child&#39;s personality. Someone <br/>\nelse mentioned getting down at eye level...that would probably get <br/>\nyou a black eye around here. Mo usually needs a little solitude and <br/>\nwill seek it (and defend it) herself. There&#39;s a whole range of <br/>\npossibilities in between there, so observing and trying to follow <br/>\nyour kid&#39;s cues is pretty important.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He really needed me and<br/>\n&gt; I was paralysed <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to invite you to look at some possible expectations you <br/>\nmight be holding about what &quot;good parenting&quot; looks like. Do you have <br/>\na mental image, somewhere, of a loving mom holding and comforting a <br/>\ncrying child? If that&#39;s Not what your kid needs in the moment, then <br/>\nholding on to that ideal isn&#39;t helping you - you end up beating <br/>\nyourself up for doing the right thing!

Jack is so intense and so dang bright!<br/>\n He is exhausting with his constant exploration, building, tearing<br/>\napart and so forth.   It&#39;s frustrating to my husband who was the type<br/>\nof child who never broke anything, never lost any piece to anything,<br/>\nnever even damaged the original boxes that his toys came in.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy grandmother says Jack is like my dad in that he must see how it<br/>\nworks, what it can do , how it can do it better and with a bigger<br/>\nbang!   My father was given a child&#39;s tool set for Christmas one year<br/>\nin the time when children&#39;s toys were fully functional small versions<br/>\nof adult things.  There were 7 children in his family so he asked if<br/>\nhe could go into their parlor to be alone for a bit (picture busy<br/>\nhouse of 7 children with all the visiting cousins running around!)she<br/>\nchecked on him after a bit and found that he had sawed the legs off <br/>\nof an end table!!!   Luckily my grandfather was in the furniture<br/>\nbusiness and of the 7 children 5 were boys so was unphased  but<br/>\nGrandmother was not happy with her table being redecorated!! <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nJack and a friend once emptied an entire new 5 gallon water bottle<br/>\nfrom our water cooler.   Jack attached our fish aquarium siphon funnel<br/>\nto longer tubing and had his friend filling the funnel (funny how it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t occur to his friend to wonder where the water was going he was<br/>\nso enjoying the filling and emptying!)  Jack sprayed our whole kitchen<br/>\nincluding our poor guinea pigs&#39; cage... they were literally treading<br/>\nwater when I happened upon the scene (one of those I have to grab<br/>\nsomething from upstairs I will be right back moments!)   It was<br/>\nhilarious!  It took hours to clean up... and the water was COLD but it<br/>\nwas a hot summer day so who can complain???   I did find all the<br/>\nuneven spots in my kitchen floor!   Anyway it&#39;s nice to hear other<br/>\nlittle people that are wired similarly do the same things!  My husband<br/>\nsometimes attaches destructive intent which is a hard discussion. <br/>\nIt&#39;s really hard sometimes when the two of them are wired so<br/>\ndifferently!   <br/>\n<br/>\nJack also frequently paints himself ... someone was complaining about<br/>\nmud... try having a child running through the house covered in blue<br/>\npaint! HA!!   I try to remember how these times are so fleeting...<br/>\nsoon he will be grown up and not want to cuddle while covered in his<br/>\nlatest experiment! <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Blocker<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once upon a time, Jalen cut a hole in our couch. When I saw it I said<br/>\n&gt; &quot;So tell me about this&quot; and pointed at the hole. It was a very calm<br/>\n&gt; &quot;tell me...&quot; so he told me how he could feel something inside the<br/>\n&gt; couch but he couldn&#39;t see what it was, so he cut it open to find out<br/>\n&gt; what was inside. It was the foam of course. Curiosity often leads to<br/>\n&gt; some interesting exploration!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I simply told him that next time he was really curious about what was<br/>\n&gt; inside, could he please come get me because there were ways to see<br/>\n&gt; inside of stuff without cutting it.:) I showed him the zipper on the<br/>\n&gt; back of the cushion at that point too....sigh.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are so many things that Jalen has done that may seem<br/>\n&gt; destructive, but it&#39;s all about learning and exploration.

In my opinion, letting your son act out his fear and over-whelmed feelings with the teddy bear were wonderful.  I don&#39;t know about your son, but my daughter really needed to act out things like that.  I found with her that talking about her feelings too much when she was in the moment just escalated her rages.  I used to talk to her about how it frankly sucks to lose control, and that I would take care of her and keep her safe, and soon she&#39;d be able to get her control back.  I also played some wild intense playacting games with her that made me feel uncomfortable at times, but she needed it--she needed to beat up her stuffed animal or whatever, and as much as I hate violence I didn&#39;t try to contain it.  (She never acted against a living creature.)  Perhaps your son needs similar acting out with you? The dog thing he was acting out sounds like he was taking control of the scariest thing he knew of and playing it out. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy girl&#39;s 14 now, and we&#39;ve learned a lot since those wild days.  We all know about overstimulation and sometimes (I swear I&#39;m not saying this as a sort of barb due to the somehow pro-limit stance I&#39;m taking in other posts!) need to limit her or remind her of her own interior limits, just as you said in hindsight you wished you&#39;d ensured you&#39;re son got his after-lunch rest.  Sadly in the world we cannot control others and their not-so-child-friendly stances, and there are going to be days where it&#39;s just all too much for the little ones. Yeah, he probably &quot;got&quot; the non-child-friendly vibes, (which always made me cranky, which in turn made my daughter more upset, until I learned to either let it slide or call people on it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think talking about it the next day when things have calmed is useful--but not too much.  From what I understand, just a few phrases are all a 7 yo can developmentally handle--not huge long conversations.   So I think you were on the right track with not &quot;putting thing sin his mouth.&quot; And I think you needn&#39;t feel like you failed him--it sounds like you supported him.

Then I&#39;ll begin calmly clarifying/acknowledging anything she <br/>\nis saying. For instance, the other day my dh witnessed dd jab the <br/>\npointy end of her scissors into my desk chair. My husband asked her <br/>\nto <br/>\nplease not cut the chair. (He is extremely good with her, and a <br/>\nnatural <br/>\nand intuitive unschooler, so I am certain this was asked kindly.) She <br/>\nmelted down, and started sobbing uncontrollably. He was in the middle <br/>\nof a rather cumbersome and challenging task, so he called me to check <br/>\non her. When I got to where she was (on our &quot;big bed&quot; as she calls <br/>\nit), <br/>\nI sat down with her and listened. When she is upset, she will often <br/>\nfollow a familiar pattern. First, she is angry, and will blame her <br/>\ndear <br/>\nfriend G. (another unschooler, who is 7, and who loves my dd dearly, <br/>\nand always looks out for her), which is what she did in this <br/>\ncase. &quot;G. <br/>\ndid it! She took the scissors and stabbed the chair! Bad G.! Stupid <br/>\nG.!&quot; She&#39;ll then go through her list of those she most loves, calling <br/>\neach of them &quot;stupid Mom, stupid Dad&quot; etc. At this point, I&#39;ll simply <br/>\nacknowledge that she&#39;s really mad. I&#39;ll say something like &quot;You sound <br/>\nreally mad. You feel like G. is stupid, and Mommy is stupid,&quot; etc. <br/>\nThis <br/>\nwill often begin to have a softening affect on her, at which point I <br/>\nmay gently and briefly initiate physical contact (a stroke of the <br/>\nknee <br/>\nor arm).  We&#39;ll go through as many rounds of this as necessary, her <br/>\nexpressing something, me acknowledging what she&#39;s expressing, until I <br/>\nknow she&#39;s receptive to hearing a comment about her actions. In this <br/>\ncase, my comment was: &quot;It&#39;s just a chair,&quot; along with a soft smile <br/>\nand a stroke of her arm. At this point, she fell into <br/>\nmy lap sobbing again, but it was a sob of relief. Once she was done, <br/>\nwe <br/>\nwere able to go look at the chair together, talk about why it <br/>\nhappened <br/>\n(she thought she saw a bug crawl in there, and wanted to give it a <br/>\nway <br/>\nout!) and what else she might do in the future, besides cut the chair.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my dd, the key is getting on her level, and seeing the experience <br/>\nthrough her eyes. I&#39;m not always right about my assumptions re: why <br/>\nshe <br/>\ndid something (in this case, I thought she might just be exploring <br/>\nthe <br/>\nsharpness of the scissors, or how it would feel to push them through <br/>\nthe fabric. I never would have guessed she was trying to set a bug <br/>\nfree! LOL! Though that&#39;s so like her :)), but I can see how much she <br/>\nappreciates being really listened to. And of course, the other key is <br/>\nallowing her to express her feelings without judgement, and without <br/>\nrepercussion, so she knows she is safe. She knows she is loved <br/>\nwhether <br/>\nshe&#39;s angry, joyful, sad, whatever. Her emotions don&#39;t carry a price <br/>\ntag when it comes to her parents love of her. I think often parents <br/>\nget <br/>\ncaught up in feeling they must &quot;do&quot; something when their children act <br/>\nout or melt down, or whatever else children do that don&#39;t conform to <br/>\nan <br/>\nadult world. Most of the time, though, the acts of listening and <br/>\nloving <br/>\nare all that are required. Once the intensity of the moment has <br/>\npassed, then it&#39;s possible to talk about what happened, and help the <br/>\nchild see what other options are available to them.

Sarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell that you care so much about your son, and I personally feel that  <br/>\nyou already &quot;got&quot; a lot of the situation taken care of in your mind. You said  <br/>\nprevention re: his quiet time and a few other things that in hindsight, you  <br/>\nsorta &quot;knew&quot; you shouldn&#39;t have done. Don&#39;t we all have that at some point? <br/>\nYep  :) <br/>\n <br/>\nIt seems to me that your son is SO stimulated by out of the usual way of  <br/>\nthings, that he just can&#39;t cope. And you are trying to help him cope. AND - he  <br/>\nIS doing something to show you his confusion and struggles. The barking Teddy  <br/>\nspoke for him, perhaps because he felt unable (don&#39;t want to guess too much at <br/>\n his feelings of course, I&#39;m just taking what we were given and giving a <br/>\npossible  scenario). He seems like he was possibly angry with you, angry with <br/>\nhimself  and angry in general. I &quot;heard&quot; in a way, this rumbling sound, this  <br/>\nhubbub of activity that came across as chaos (what could have ben excitement to  <br/>\nanother) with noises all over, a sense of urgency and a large bit of the  <br/>\nunknown. My son, Julian, who is nearly 5, is a child that THRIVES on routine.  Oh, <br/>\nmy, especially when he was younger, just by a year, he had to do the same  <br/>\nthings in the same ways, had to know what was going to happen next on TV, video  <br/>\ngames, daily life! He had many fears and prevention was always the key to his  <br/>\ncalm. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo to nutshell my &quot;advice&quot; lol ;) I&#39;d say that you have a LOT of good  <br/>\nhindsight info and that if you can use that for future times, it may well help  <br/>\nprevent major meltdowns. I know one thing, the being quiet when going through  <br/>\nneighbor&#39;s bins, that struck me as something that probably was indeed too much  <br/>\nfor him. And I&#39;m a little unsure as to why that was a needed part of the  <br/>\nrecycling trip...<br/>\n <br/>\nSorry if I&#39;m a bit round about here - I&#39;ve been doing stickers and marbles  <br/>\nand nursing in between sentences, lol! <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224687104,"authorName":"j50yab","from":"&quot;j50yab&quot; &lt;ourhome@...&gt;","profile":"j50yab","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Real Meltdown Example and Frightened Child (7 yrs)","postDate":"1186234712","msgId":25484,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY5MXZnbys1aTM0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25483,"nextInTopic":25490,"prevInTime":25483,"nextInTime":25485,"topicId":25483,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was actually going to ask advice about the dogs scenario (below), then I realised that I now have a real meltdown example to share and would really","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1477578000\">I was actually going to ask advice about the dogs scenario (below),<br/>\nthen I realised that I now have a real &quot;meltdown&quot; example to share and<br/>\nwould really appreciate advice as to what I could have done before,<br/>\nduring and after.   If your advice is far from what I did/am doing<br/>\ncould you help me out by giving me a &quot;next step&quot; clue of what to work<br/>\non as sometimes suggestions are so far away from where we&#39;re at, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t even imagine how to get there?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, it&#39;s a bit of a long story, but since I don&#39;t know which bits<br/>\nare most important I&#39;ll need to tell you all of it..<br/>\n<br/>\nFor background I would say that DS1 (just 7) has been fairly<br/>\ntraditionally parented (incl yelling/time<br/>\nout/praise/rewards/punishment etc).  We have DS2 (21 months) who<br/>\nwas/is v high need/demands a lot of time and attention and up til now<br/>\nI didn&#39;t know a good way to manage their competing needs  so my heart<br/>\nbreaks to see how much DS 1 is struggling with this and I know his<br/>\nneeds are not being met by me.  Could go on and on with examples etc<br/>\nbut that is not the point of this post.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday we had a wonderful day, 5 hours (!!!) of it were spent<br/>\ncollecting, sorting, bagging, and delivering other peoples empty<br/>\nplastic bottles to the recycling depot.  Despite all the problems I&#39;m<br/>\ngoing to list DS 1 really wanted to do this, and it was very important<br/>\nto him.  Looking from the outside I might conclude that all the<br/>\n&quot;problems&quot; weighed heavier than the gain, and so I sld not have guided<br/>\nhim to it from the start?<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Naturally all the work was physically very tiring for him.  <br/>\n<br/>\n2. He usually plays alone in his room for an hour after lunch as he<br/>\nreally starts to flag and get ratty yesterday we skipped it (mistake<br/>\nwith hindsight I think) as he was enjoying the recycling bottles so much.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. There was quite a lot of conversational contact with adults because<br/>\nof the project.  DS1 is a little shy (for your information only, I do<br/>\nnot mean I am trying to change this) and he is trying to engage with<br/>\nother children and adults but is not very skilled at it.  So I think<br/>\nit is hard work for him emotionally and mentally (and even harder for<br/>\nme to watch as his approaches are usually quite &quot;inappropriate&quot; from<br/>\nthe pov of the other adult who consider him rude).   Maybe I sld steer<br/>\naway from adult interaction for now except people he knows well and<br/>\ncan talk to in a comfortable way (hardly anyone)?<br/>\n<br/>\n4. To help with the &quot;rude&quot; approaches he is unintentionally making to<br/>\nadults I will give him examples (regularly I guess when we are doing<br/>\nthis kind of thing) of what he could say, and I will model it myself<br/>\ntoo.  So this is a possible added &quot;pressure&quot; from Mum, not sure if he<br/>\nfeels it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Unfortunately the area/circumstances where we live mean strangers<br/>\ncan unpredictably be aggressive/angry for no reason, so, for eg, in<br/>\nthis project I am often mentioning how we must take the bottles<br/>\ncarefully and quietly etc so as not to disturb people (honestly,<br/>\ndrives me mad and has me on eggshells  for example if he drops a bag<br/>\nand makes a big noise in someone&#39;s yard I might shout at him before I<br/>\ncan stop myself and I feel really bad for that as it undermines all<br/>\nthe confidence and belief in him self that I am trying to rebuild here<br/>\n- but it wld not be a surprise for someone to open their front door<br/>\nand shout &quot;what the f*** do you think you&#39;re doing in my bin, get out<br/>\nof there you f***ing&quot; etc etc).  DS1 has not experienced this directly<br/>\nbut it has happened in the past in his hearing although he may have<br/>\nbeen too busy with other things to notice.  So sadly I am beginning to<br/>\nbend his world view a little and squeeze his natural childishness<br/>\n(nagging how &quot;we need to try and be very quiet as some people wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nlike for us to make noise in their yard&quot;, &quot;we must try hard not to<br/>\nbrush past people in the street as we don&#39;t want to disturb someone&quot;<br/>\nie get a mouthful of vile abuse etc  these are just a few examples<br/>\nbut it comes up loads sadly).  This is all in order to keep us safe<br/>\nfrom physical or verbal abuse.  so more pressure from Mum.  Maybe I<br/>\nwld be better avoiding these kinds of scenarios as much as possible as<br/>\nthis is unfair restriction on a child?  But it is the same in town or<br/>\nsupermarket anyway so it is continual really if we go out anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. At the depot he was helping adults who he respected and liked and<br/>\ntherefore wanted to please, but they did not have good child tolerance<br/>\nlevels so kept on correcting him for doing childlike things  don&#39;t<br/>\nknow if he noticed or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Also at depot the adult he respected and liked was doing 2 things<br/>\nthat DS1 views to be &quot;wrong&quot;, I don&#39;t disagree with DS&#39;s view on these<br/>\nbut he normally needs quite a bit of support to deal with his confused<br/>\nand conflicting feelings re someone he trusts/likes/respects doing<br/>\nsomething he considers to be morally wrong, an example would be<br/>\ncalling someone names etc.  In this case I couldn&#39;t talk to him<br/>\nbecause he was in the thick of it doing a job with the other adults.<br/>\n<br/>\n8.\t When they finished, all the workers had a small bottle of water to<br/>\ndrink for a refreshment which DS1 opened and brought home with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n9.\t Before leaving, DS1 wanted to take some photos.  There were 5<br/>\npolice cars in the corner, I could tell they were on a job and they<br/>\nhad dogs in the back, one of the men and his dog got out.  DS1 is<br/>\nabsolutely utterly terrified of dogs if they run or bark and come<br/>\ntowards him.  I didn&#39;t tell him/persuade him not to do the photos (I<br/>\nthink that may have been a mistake?) but pointed the dog out to him so<br/>\nhe was aware of the situation and not taken by surprise.  He had<br/>\nalready heard it and was really edgy.  He wanted to take the photo but<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t concentrate because of the dogs.  I stood on the dog side of<br/>\nhim and had my hand on him and asked if he wanted to stay or go.  He<br/>\nsaid stay (I think I should have come up with a suitable truthful<br/>\nexcuse/reason to leave immediately without making him make the<br/>\ndecision). Then all the dogs started barking like mad in the cars.  <br/>\n<br/>\n10.\tSo we finished up and left  - conversation continued in the car<br/>\nabout the dogs.  As he is a little sensitive I am always cautious<br/>\nabout sharing too much before he is ready and have never actually<br/>\ndiscussed the role of police dogs with him.  Because I thought he was<br/>\nprob quite afraid this time I told him a little about what they do and<br/>\nemphasised that they do as the police man says, thinking that a little<br/>\nfactual knowledge might help normalise it a bit (I could tell it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t help and I wonder if I should have said nothing at all  how<br/>\ncld I have better dealt with this?  We had about 5 together minutes in<br/>\nthe car.)<br/>\n<br/>\n11.\tWe came in the house, I turned my back to hang up my coat and<br/>\nimmediately DS2 took the water bottle out of DS1s hand.  Then he had a<br/>\ncomplete meltdown.  He screamed and cried harder than I have seen in<br/>\nmany years.  His emotions were absolutely huge and I think he will<br/>\nhave frightened himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n12.\t I had to make an instant decision and so I took water back from<br/>\nDS2, gave DS2 to his Dad and went to see DS1 who had run into the next<br/>\nroom howling with tears streaming.  When I went in he had a teddy and<br/>\npretended it was a crazed dog and made it bark madly at me in a really<br/>\nwild way saying if you xyz (can&#39;t remember what, might have said if<br/>\nyou come in here) my dog will xyz (can&#39;t remember but the dog was very<br/>\nfierce and he might have said it will bite you).<br/>\n<br/>\n13.\tThe wild teddy was repeated another 3 times, to his Dad and DS2<br/>\ntwice.  I just didn&#39;t know what to say or do.  He really needed me and<br/>\nI was paralysed  I have no clue how I could have helped him manage<br/>\nhis feelings right then.  But, coming from a traditional parenting<br/>\nbackground, at least I managed not to take teddy off him or tell him<br/>\nto stop it.<br/>\n<br/>\n14.\tCouple of minutes later he went to the toilet with the mad teddy<br/>\nwhich barked and shouted at DS2.  I asked him was he frightened of the<br/>\npolice dogs.  He answered in a barking dog voice &quot;they were very noisy<br/>\nI don&#39;t like all their noise&quot;.  Actually they weren&#39;t that loud as<br/>\nthey were a little way away and obviously his fear of the dogs isn&#39;t<br/>\njust annoyance at their loud noise  but I didn&#39;t say anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n15.\tWith me he is a very good communicator but I think he cannot<br/>\ndescribe his feelings, a conversation about the dogs I think would<br/>\nhave gone nowhere  I would have been talking and &quot;putting things into<br/>\nhis mouth&quot; and that&#39;s about it.  So I didn&#39;t talk about it any more<br/>\nand I feel I let him down.  Took him another 2 hours to get off to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas anyone please.  I was really upset about not being able to<br/>\nhelp him with the &quot;meltdown&quot;.  But the whole day contains lots of<br/>\nother issues as well.  Please be gentle as we aren&#39;t unschooling at<br/>\nthe moment so I only know and understand what I&#39;ve read on here and<br/>\ncouple of other boards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.

But, coming from a traditional parenting<br/>\nbackground, at least I managed not to take teddy off him or tell him<br/>\nto stop it.<br/>\n<br/>\n14.\tCouple of minutes later he went to the toilet with the mad teddy<br/>\nwhich barked and shouted at DS2.  I asked him was he frightened of the<br/>\npolice dogs.  He answered in a barking dog voice &quot;they were very noisy<br/>\nI don&#39;t like all their noise&quot;.  Actually they weren&#39;t that loud as<br/>\nthey were a little way away and obviously his fear of the dogs isn&#39;t<br/>\njust annoyance at their loud noise  but I didn&#39;t say anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n15.\tWith me he is a very good communicator but I think he cannot<br/>\ndescribe his feelings, a conversation about the dogs I think would<br/>\nhave gone nowhere  I would have been talking and &quot;putting things into<br/>\nhis mouth&quot; and that&#39;s about it.  So I didn&#39;t talk about it any more<br/>\nand I feel I let him down.  Took him another 2 hours to get off to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas anyone please.  I was really upset about not being able to<br/>\nhelp him with the &quot;meltdown&quot;.  But the whole day contains lots of<br/>\nother issues as well.  Please be gentle as we aren&#39;t unschooling at<br/>\nthe moment so I only know and understand what I&#39;ve read on here and<br/>\ncouple of other boards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.
