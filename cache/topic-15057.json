Read creation stories from all over the world.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree.<br/>\nAnd also read the historical influences on the religion. Once you know<br/>\nthe history behind how SO much of it came to be, it takes the &quot;sting&quot;<br/>\nout of it. You understand how humans came to believe things that seem<br/>\npretty unrealistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll be better equipped to answer the &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; of certain<br/>\ndogmas if you know some of the historical influences. &#39;Course I LOVE<br/>\nresearching religions/beliefs, and if it&#39;s not your thing it might not<br/>\nbe as fun!:)<br/>\nKnowing a bit of it helps you put it all in context though.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14958,"nextTopicId":15052}}
