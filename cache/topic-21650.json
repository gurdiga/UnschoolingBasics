Starting with infancy where <br/>\nchild was carried in sling and slept as needed.  When a toddler child might <br/>\nplayi on the bed while i slept with the lights low or my sleeping on living <br/>\nroom couch while child continues to watch tv.   Naps were important to me <br/>\n(still are...but now kids don&#39;t nap when i do during the day).  As they got <br/>\nolder ear phones for music, audio book, or dvd in bedroom while i slept <br/>\nwiith lights off.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my night owl was about 6 she actually chose to stay up by herself and <br/>\nturn off the lights when she was ready to come to bed.  That happened once <br/>\nor twice until she decided she didn&#39;t like being the only one up by herself <br/>\nso there after has always been fine with coming to bed with me if i was <br/>\nexhausted earlier than she or whenever the last other person went to bed.   <br/>\nShe likes when i read to her at night so i will let her know that if that is <br/>\ngoing to happen it needs to be now because in half hour or more i won&#39;t be <br/>\nable to keep my eyes open.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my child is really adamant about staying up later than i intended (like <br/>\nlast night) i do stay up later to help her with what she needs.  I have <br/>\nfound that when i am genuinely willing to be there and available for her <br/>\nthen she is trully understanding when i look at her and say i just have to <br/>\ngo to sleep.  It&#39;s never an arbitrary limit set for she or for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt happens that sometimes i go to sleep early in the evening before my dh <br/>\nand then when he comes to bed later my younger dd will then come and snuggle <br/>\nwith me for her bedtime comfort.  Or occasionally i&#39;ve gotten back up to be <br/>\nwith her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been accustomed to nursing for 13 years now so being snuggled up to <br/>\nin the middle of the night for some nighttime milk is not unusual whether we <br/>\nhave both fallen to sleep at the same time or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first born is not a night owl.  She used to drag me up to bed before i <br/>\nwas ready to end my day or while i might be in the middle of something.  I&#39;d <br/>\ndo what she needed and then either go back to my stuff or sleep as well.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s an early riser and at an early age made herself something to eat in <br/>\nthe a.m. if i was still sleeping.  Both kids do this now if i was up late.  <br/>\nI was lucky in that my first born was a napper and so i could catch up on <br/>\nsleep throughout the day.  It was special time napping together.  I miss it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second dd is not a napper...is an energizer bunny.

If there is <br/>\nsomething someone needs to get up early for i&#39;ve come to learn it better be <br/>\nsomething they really want to be doing or getting up early is a struggle.  <br/>\nSo if there is something that one person in the house wants to get up early <br/>\nfor and it requires the rest of us to do so as well we&#39;ve come to discover <br/>\nthis can work with planning.  We do what it takes to find an real incentive <br/>\nthat will excite the others to get up.  If that is not available then i make <br/>\nplans so that they can remain in bed and no one else is dependant on them to <br/>\ndo what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Katharine Wise &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katharinewise@...\">katharinewise@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: Unschooling Basics &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [unschoolingbasics] bedtime and waking<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sat, 24 Feb 2007 05:42:09 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sorry this is long, but I figured detail would help.  In the past week I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt;tried letting my 4yo go to sleep and wake up when he wants which has been <br/>\n&gt;okay -- it&#39;s had a mixture of frustrations and benefits -- but tomorrow I <br/>\n&gt;have definitely have a problem and overall it&#39;s starting to cause sleep <br/>\n&gt;issues for dh and myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To flesh out the scene:  10yo ds likes the lights out at 9:20pm.  Wakes <br/>\n&gt;about 6:30-7am, and enjoys playing alone for about an hour until he wants <br/>\n&gt;breakfast (and Daddy to make it) at 8am.   7yo ds comes out of the bedroom <br/>\n&gt;and reads awhile longer after oldest turns out the lights.  I take him to <br/>\n&gt;bed and sing to him about 10pm.  He wakes to have breakfast with dh too.  <br/>\n&gt;(The two older share a room.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;4yo had been a struggle at both ends.  I would usually try to get him to <br/>\n&gt;bed before 7yo, but especially recently it had been after.   Sometimes he&#39;d <br/>\n&gt;really object and stay up until 11pm or so for a few days.  Then one night <br/>\n&gt;he&#39;d crash at 7 or 8pm.  I would always wake him (not very easily) about <br/>\n&gt;8am.  I get up and shower about 7:30 while dh is still home and 4yo&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;asleep so no worry about sibling battles with the 7yo.  (4yo co-sleeps with <br/>\n&gt;us and nurses to sleep, though it usually doesn&#39;t take long.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So the last week I&#39;ve been letting him go to sleep and wake up completely <br/>\n&gt;on his own.  First day he slept until 11:30am.  Then 9:30am.  Has evened <br/>\n&gt;out at about 10:30am.  For a few days he was tired and wanting to go to bed <br/>\n&gt;around 11pm.  One night 11:30.  But now we&#39;re hitting a general conflict -- <br/>\n&gt;dh and I are exhausted!  Last night we insisted on going to bed at 11pm.  <br/>\n&gt;Ds wanted to continue playing -- with me.  I empathized, explained that if <br/>\n&gt;I didn&#39;t go to bed I would be cross and cranky and not much fun to play <br/>\n&gt;with the next day.  Offered that he could play while I went to bed, but he <br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t want that.  So now I feel like I&#39;m still struggling with him over <br/>\n&gt;going to bed, except it&#39;s at 11:30 instead of 9:30 and I&#39;m not sure what <br/>\n&gt;the benefit of that is.  (And DH is looking at me and saying, &quot;This wasn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;*my* crazy idea!&quot;)  The other more immediate problem is that tomorrow we <br/>\n&gt;need to leave for church at 9:30.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Suggestions?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;Katharine<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Everyone is raving about the all-new Yahoo!

You say <br/>\n<br/>\nyou&#39;re not sure what the benefit is - did you have a specific hope <br/>\n<br/>\nin mind? If the idea is to help your guy have more autonomy wrt <br/>\n<br/>\ngetting his sleep needs met, did you have an expectation as to how <br/>\n<br/>\nthat would look? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past, sometimes he would tell me he was tired and wanted to go to bed, but more often I was saying, &quot;Come on, it&#39;s time for bed.&quot;  Sometimes he would come with me and sometimes he would insist on staying up and playing.  I think what I found most wearing was the unpredictability of it.  And I was always trying to wake him up at about the same time in the hopes that he wouldn&#39;t stay up late, but sometimes it was really hard to wake him.   So I guess I was hoping that if I just let him say when he was ready, he would settle on some more predictable pattern.  Plus, reading about letting children &quot;unschool&quot; sleeping, I was curious to see what would happen.  I&#39;ve always tried to be flexible and responsive, but bedtimes have definitely been parent-led.  When I said I wasn&#39;t sure what the benefit was, I meant that before I&#39;d been urging him to go to bed at 9:30 and now I was still doing the urging -- except it was two hours later.  (There was a clear benefit in the morning<br/>\n though when I had time alone with the older two -- but that was lessened as the week went by because I was increasingly tired.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It kind of sounds as though you were hoping he&#39;d become more <br/>\n<br/>\nindependant in terms of going to sleep, and that may not be possible <br/>\n<br/>\nfor him at this time. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not mean that I wanted to go to sleep independently.  I&#39;m no more ready than he is to give up nursing my third (last?) baby to sleep:-)  I realize my post may have given that impression though, and I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s what you meant here or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;He may still need mom (or dad) to help him figure out how tired feels and what to do about it. Is that something y&#39;all have talked about in general, or has it always <br/>\n<br/>\nbeen &quot;bedtime&quot;? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably a mixture of  &quot;it&#39;s time to go to bed&quot; and &quot;aren&#39;t you feeling tired?&quot; and &quot;you were up really late last night so you must be tired&quot; but I guess not talking about how tired feels.  He does sometimes say he&#39;s tired.  Other times he&#39;s an energizer bunny -- &quot;let&#39;s play this, let&#39;s play that...&quot; and I don&#39;t see any signs of tired either except in me:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What&#39;s he like right before going to sleep? Does he settle down gradually or just suddenly collapse? Also, how is he generally in terms of getting what he needs - does he like to play by himself and get his own snacks etc in general? or does he prefer help overall? Is he wanting some &quot;special time&quot; with mom or dad? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually suddenly collapses.  Play, play, play then &quot;I&#39;m tired, Mommy.  Let&#39;s go to bed.  *Now*.&quot;  Or, if I initiate, he may or may not cooperate.  In either case, he usually nurses to sleep pretty quickly and solidly.  (None of that sneaking away inch by inch required in order for me to get back up:-)  Definitely not particularly independent.  Wants a playmate, preferably me.  All of my boys like for us to do most things for them.  I&#39;m sure he loved the time alone with us while his brothers were asleep, even though he gets a *lot* of my attention during the day while his brothers play together -- it&#39;s never enough:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNeed Mail bonding?<br/>\nGo to the Yahoo!
