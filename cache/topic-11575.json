Maybe they&#39;re getting their fill right now. Maybe they just <br/>\n really, really enjoy gaming. <br/>\n One of the best pieces of advice I picked up from these lists is to <br/>\n be there, right along side your kids when they&#39;re doing something. <br/>\n Hang out with them while they&#39;re playing. Grab a control and play <br/>\n also. The three of you can go online and look for gaming sites and <br/>\n cheat codes for their favorite games. <br/>\n Also, I curious...where do you live that it&#39;ll be to hot soon to go <br/>\n outside. We live in Florida and my kids play outside in the morning <br/>\n and evening in the summer because it&#39;s just to hot in the afternoon. <br/>\n Maybe you can also think up some fun things to do out of the house-<br/>\n take them to a park or a hiking trail or go bike riding with <br/>\n them,,,maybe you can even invite their friend. <br/>\n As for answered questions from your teacher-neighbor-friend....for <br/>\n right now, I&#39;d say as little as possible until you are more secure <br/>\n with what you&#39;re doing. That&#39;s what worked for me. I have to get <br/>\n things all right in my own head before I can talk to people about it <br/>\n (not my husband-just other people). How about handing her an <br/>\n unschooling book...maybe one of John Holts which she may enjoy ebing <br/>\n she&#39;s a teacher. Or maybe direct her to a website. When she asks a <br/>\n question, you could say something like &quot;I like that you&#39;re <br/>\n interested in learning more...here&#39;s some information I picked up <br/>\n for you.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n Well, I hoped some of this helps.

If the type of games were limited I <br/>\n could see this, but we have many games, and they all play runescape <br/>\n online...which is very involved, and the interesting stuff on it <br/>\n never ending, and they are always adding new &quot;quests&quot; to the game.  <br/>\n Cable TV also provides endless &quot;new&quot; watching opportunities. Right <br/>\n now they don&#39;t care to go outside, and explore.

Maybe they&#39;re getting their fill right now. Maybe they just <br/>\nreally, really enjoy gaming. <br/>\nOne of the best pieces of advice I picked up from these lists is to <br/>\nbe there, right along side your kids when they&#39;re doing something. <br/>\nHang out with them while they&#39;re playing. Grab a control and play <br/>\nalso. The three of you can go online and look for gaming sites and <br/>\ncheat codes for their favorite games. <br/>\nAlso, I curious...where do you live that it&#39;ll be to hot soon to go <br/>\noutside. We live in Florida and my kids play outside in the morning <br/>\nand evening in the summer because it&#39;s just to hot in the afternoon. <br/>\nMaybe you can also think up some fun things to do out of the house-<br/>\ntake them to a park or a hiking trail or go bike riding with <br/>\nthem,,,maybe you can even invite their friend. <br/>\nAs for answered questions from your teacher-neighbor-friend....for <br/>\nright now, I&#39;d say as little as possible until you are more secure <br/>\nwith what you&#39;re doing. That&#39;s what worked for me. I have to get <br/>\nthings all right in my own head before I can talk to people about it <br/>\n(not my husband-just other people). How about handing her an <br/>\nunschooling book...maybe one of John Holts which she may enjoy ebing <br/>\nshe&#39;s a teacher. Or maybe direct her to a website. When she asks a <br/>\nquestion, you could say something like &quot;I like that you&#39;re <br/>\ninterested in learning more...here&#39;s some information I picked up <br/>\nfor you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I hoped some of this helps. I&#39;m on the journey also amd <br/>\nreading the archives helped me a great deal. <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (7), Shawna (10) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 30, 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://foreverparents.com\">http://foreverparents.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;L.
