But, for the purpose of this metaphor, is UU really considered a religion? To me, religion = dogma. It&#39;s a set of beliefs and practices and devotions that lead to a higher grace or state of being. It&#39;s something you join, but also somethng you believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is from the UU website: <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAt a Unitarian Universalist worship service or meeting, you are likely to find members whose positions on faith may be derived from a variety of religious beliefs: Jewish, Christian, Buddhist, naturist, atheist, or agnostic. Members might tell you that they are religious humanists, liberal Christians, or world religionists.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll these people, and others who label their beliefs still differently, are faithful Unitarian Universalists committed to the practice of free religion. We worship, sing, play, study, teach, and work for social justice together as congregations-all the while remaining strong in our individual convictions.<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSo are they the religion or are they derived from a variety of religious beliefs? Are they the sandwich or the deli or are they just the dining room, the place to enjoy the sandwich you&#39;ve made? The UU to me is a safe place for people of varying beliefs to join together, but the UU itself is not a religion in and of itself. Of course I could be very, very wrong. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI looked up the definition of religion and they don&#39;t mention dogma, so I guess maybe that&#39;s my interpretation (or baggage). This last entry made me smile though.<br/>\n<br/>\n   4.  A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion.<br/>\n <br/>\nUh oh. The religion of unschooling?! Aaaaaack!! I hope not. This is a personal journey for sure.<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the<br/>\ngreen earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly<br/>\nalive.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n -------------- Original message ----------------------<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Heather&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heather@...\">heather@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":35875473,"authorName":"Heather","from":"&quot;Heather&quot; &lt;heather@...&gt;","profile":"heather_200115","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] OT spirituality","postDate":"1136856900","msgId":8926,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzYzMwZjVmLjVlNzVhMGEzLjU2NjcuZmZmZmVlNzlAbXguZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRwdjJkdStldmswQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8925,"nextInTopic":8928,"prevInTime":8925,"nextInTime":8927,"topicId":8925,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So I d think they acknowledge that people make other sandwiches, but any religious dogma would say that the sandwich is not made in the right way.
