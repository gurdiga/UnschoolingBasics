I&#39;ve smilingly reminisced <br/>\nabout my own kid at that age.  I&#39;ve commented about how well their child was <br/>\ncoping with being where he didn&#39;t really want to be, saying something like, <br/>\n&quot;he&#39;s so little but it&#39;s easy to see he&#39;s doing the best he can.&quot;   I&#39;ve <br/>\noffered to get the rest of the items on her list for her, or stand there <br/>\nwith her kid(s) while she got the rest of the items.

In the commercial blue ice-cubes float <br/>\nout of people&#39;s mouths after they brush with this toothpaste. Mo was <br/>\nexcited and wanted to try it, so we found her a brush. Needless to <br/>\nsay, blue ice-cubes did not come out her mouth. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy neighbor was somewhat surprised that I didn&#39;t use the incident as <br/>\nsome kind of &quot;lesson&quot; regarding the falseness of advertising. Mo and <br/>\nI have talked about the difference between the way things are <br/>\nportrayed on tv vs the way things are in life before (wrt school <br/>\nlooking like fun on shows for young children), so I didn&#39;t think she <br/>\nneeded that piece of information all over again. <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, when Mo asked me why the commercial showed something that <br/>\nwas so blatantly non-factual we talked about metaphor and different <br/>\nways to express feelings in a visual medium. That&#39;s really <br/>\ninteresting to her in terms of drawing cartoons, and she was <br/>\nintrigued by the idea of using digital images to suggest an emotion <br/>\nor sensation in the same way a cartoon uses different lines and <br/>\nshapes and colors. Now she relates to the ad on the level of <br/>\ndisagreeing with the artist&#39;s representation. *She* would have used <br/>\nlittle explosions.<br/>\n<br/>\n***********************<br/>\nI&#39;d like to think my enlightened home could counteract the effects of<br/>\ntelevision, but I have lost faith in myself somewhere. <br/>\n***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that the &quot;effects of television&quot; are completely different <br/>\nthan my expectations about those effects - I didn&#39;t have tv for <br/>\nyears, so *all* I knew about tv, and especially advertising was the <br/>\nanti-tv propaganda. But both my kids use tv in very very different <br/>\nways than I had anticipated - and I think a big part of that has to <br/>\ndo with my willingness to set aside my preconceptions and really <br/>\nconnect with my kids on this subject. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother story - last night Ray and I were having dinner with the <br/>\nsame neighbor, who has out-of-town guests. All very &quot;alternative&quot; <br/>\nand anti-tv. At one point the dinner conversation turned to <br/>\ndiscussing world population and Ray managed to come up with a whole <br/>\nbunch of facts about population density - even sat and figured some <br/>\npercentages. One of the guests made a comment that he must be doing <br/>\nwell in school, and he replied &quot;No Way! I hated school!

(spanking)   And next, some people don&#39;t seem to know the <br/>\ndifference between<br/>\nfiction and reality.   Some of that might be because for years<br/>\nthey&#39;ve heard experts talk about &quot;violence&quot; on TV, as if fiction was real <br/>\nviolence.    I prefer to keep things in perspective.<br/>\nI was also filling bird feeders, washing out bird baths, taking out the<br/>\ntrash, making food for my family and getting ready to go to work.  The<br/>\nsituation called for brevity. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n***I can&#39;t control the violence<br/>\nmy daughter sees while out in the world. At the park the other day<br/>\nshe saw a lady whacking her dog around. It upset her, we discussed<br/>\nit. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did you say?  Did you tell her to stop?<br/>\nWhen people encounter a new situation they have to stretch themselves in new<br/>\nways to understand it.  John Holt wrote that was the real test of<br/>\nintelligence; how a person acts when they encounter something completely<br/>\nnew or unexpected.  We&#39;re always processing information from our <br/>\nenvironment.   We are designed<br/>\nto process all kinds of information.  Unpleasant things are not alien or<br/>\neven bad for our brains they are as normal as the pleasant stuff. <br/>\nUnpleasant bits of information are like any other<br/>\nkinds of information.  They give us reason to think in new ways and they<br/>\ngive us something to stick new information to the next time we come up<br/>\nagainst something unexpected or unpleasant.<br/>\n<br/>\n***That is why I didn&#39;t want TV. She already has to see the real<br/>\nlife violence, why inundate her with even more through TV? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, TV is not  &quot;real life violence&quot; so you couldn&#39;t inundate her with <br/>\n&quot;even more real life violence&quot; through TV. &lt;g&gt;   And why would you <br/>\n&quot;inundate&quot; anybody with anything?  (except for chocolate, maybe) You won&#39;t <br/>\nfind unschooling advice that says &quot;Flood your kids with TV!  Overwhelm them <br/>\nwith adult shows!&quot;  &quot;Give them more than what they want!&quot;   Inundate is a <br/>\nloaded word.  We&#39;re saying *let her watch if she wants* and you&#39;re hearing <br/>\n&quot;make her watch everything!&quot;   Or, you&#39;re imagining she&#39;d want to watch <br/>\neverything.  She wont.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, if you don&#39;t take anything else away from this discussion, please <br/>\ntry to understand that we&#39;re suggesting parents open the world to their <br/>\nkids, as much as possible, including TV.  Give them a big life.    We&#39;re not <br/>\nsaying,  &quot;Make them watch. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you can talk with your daughter about the real life violence of a <br/>\nwoman whacking her dog you can talk with her<br/>\nabout the totally fictional depictions of violence on TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour little girl, at three would probably not be interested in an adult <br/>\nthemed TV series or movie with depictions of violence.  There&#39;s a lot of <br/>\nyakity yak in those shows that it boring to kids, so the chance that she&#39;d <br/>\nchoose to watch adult themed programs is pretty slim considering all the <br/>\ncool stuff there is for kids.   There are exceptions and my kid was one. <br/>\nAround the time he was four he liked more adult themed programs.  But he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t watch alone and we talked a lot.  And he&#39;s a nice kid today, doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwhack dogs or stomp on ants, doesn&#39;t pinch babies.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t think a three year old with a happy, interesting life is<br/>\nnecessarily suffering because she doesn&#39;t have TV.<br/>\nI think if a kid *does* want TV it&#39;s better for them to have it than to feel<br/>\nbad about their parents for keeping them from TV, or to be longing for it<br/>\nand to begin to feel needy so that any chance encounter with TV becomes<br/>\ntotal and desperate immersion in the hope of absorbing as much as possible<br/>\nbefore it&#39;s snatched away.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you kept her from books for the same reason?<br/>\n<br/>\n***I see the<br/>\ndifference between reality and TV but I&#39;m an adult. She is three. I<br/>\nwas afraid she wouldn&#39;t know the difference, that it would impact her<br/>\nthe same regardless of where she saw it.***<br/>\n<br/>\nMy three year old niece has been pretending to be a baby dragon for weeks.<br/>\nBefore that she was pretending she was a squirrel.  She wasn&#39;t really a<br/>\nsquirrel.  She&#39;s not really a dragon *and she knows that.*   Children have<br/>\nno difficulty at all with the concept of fantasy.  They are more likely to <br/>\nchange reality into fantasy than the other way around.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut no one here is recommending plunking a kid in front of a TV and walking<br/>\naway.  We&#39;re saying watch with them.   Talk about what&#39;s on.  Help them find <br/>\nwhat *they* enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Dylan was four and five he had  &quot;What if?&quot; questions.   &quot;What if every <br/>\ntime we talked frogs came out our ears?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;What if a giant bird picked me up and put me on the roof and was pecking at <br/>\nme?&quot;  What if my feet were as<br/>\nlong as my legs?&quot;   He definitely knew frogs wouldn&#39;t come out our ears.<br/>\nHe knew his feet would never be as long as his legs and he knew there were<br/>\nno giant birds going to take up to the roof.  He was pretending and loving<br/>\nthe new ways he was thinking.  He was thinking about how he would act in <br/>\ndifferent situations.<br/>\nHe was empowering himself and learning coping skills and expanding his own<br/>\nmind.<br/>\n<br/>\n***If this list believes that we as parents can counteract any of the ill <br/>\neffects the television or anything else brings our children, why don&#39;t we <br/>\nfeel the same way about schooling?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never seen ill effects from TV and my son is fifteen and has always had <br/>\naccess to TV and movies.   I think parents *can* counter ill effects of <br/>\nschool but *most* parents don&#39;t think there are ill effects from school. <br/>\n(from other kids, yes, but not from school)   They see school as something <br/>\ntheir child needs and they go about supporting the system of schooling. <br/>\nThey support the teachers and administrators and work with them to get their <br/>\nkids to do what is necessary to do well in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Dylan chose to go to school I&#39;d support Dylan.  I&#39;d do whatever I could <br/>\nto help him achieve his own goals, never mind the goals of the school.  I&#39;d <br/>\nwork with Dylan to get what he wanted rather than work against him to <br/>\naccomplish what the teacher wanted or the curriculum demanded.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents support their children.  They support the process of <br/>\ntheir child&#39;s individual learning, not the process of schooling or <br/>\ncurriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t keep Dylan out of school to protect him, Dylan didn&#39;t want to go to <br/>\nschool so I listened to him.   It was never my goal to limit him and I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have limited him by preventing him from going to school if that had <br/>\nbeen what he wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Guidance/some additional ?&#39;s","postDate":"1179587845","msgId":23830,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYybjRlNStsbTV2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENDODJGMDZDLTM4MjQtNEI4QS04NTVCLTgzRDVCREZDRDU1OEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":23828,"nextInTopic":23831,"prevInTime":23829,"nextInTime":23831,"topicId":23819,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~probably the same questions that make you all want to bang your head ...

A TV sits in your home and does absolutely nothing<br/>\nwithout free choice. It just sits there. Like a book, like a radio,<br/>\nlike a spoon or a cup or any other tool. Just sits.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we choose to utilize that tool, we can use it in a number of ways.<br/>\nWe can ignore the parts that don&#39;t work (or are parts that bother us),<br/>\nwe can turn it off, we can watch a show and have a supportive group of<br/>\npeople around us even if it is bothersome, we can choose to only watch<br/>\nthings we LOVE.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool doesn&#39;t give you that power or choice. You do what they say,<br/>\nyou do what others want, you are judged and graded and poked and<br/>\nprodded and molded and judged again. TV can&#39;t do that. It&#39;s just a tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf schools let you come in and choose what you would utilize there and<br/>\nhow you would utilize it, then schools wouldn&#39;t be that damaging at<br/>\nall. It&#39;s not only a world separated from the real world, you don&#39;t<br/>\neven get a choice about how to use that fantasy world. School is an<br/>\nugly thing for those that aren&#39;t choosing to be there. TV is just a<br/>\nTV.

(Others with sensitive kids can  <br/>\nhelp with specific ideas.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut your fear that she&#39;s going to be exposed to scarring violence on  <br/>\nTV is out of proportion to what happens with real kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 3.5 Kat didn&#39;t flip through the channels. She watched 101  <br/>\nDalmations over and over. (Which is fairly typical of that age. It&#39;s  <br/>\nsome brain shift that happens at 3 and they crave seeing the same  <br/>\nthing again and again.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs she got older, she would flip through looking for cartoons she  <br/>\nrecognized (ones I&#39;d introduced her to), during the day when there  <br/>\nare adults talking on TV which didn&#39;t even make her pause. I&#39;d say  <br/>\nshe treated non-cartoon shows the same way she treated adult  <br/>\nmagazines and books: they were just things in her way not worth  <br/>\nnoticing that she needed to get past. Typical kids -- and you&#39;ll know  <br/>\nif you have an atypical kid -- have a radar that draws their  <br/>\nattention to  stuff that appeals to kids and helps them tune out the  <br/>\nstuff that doesn&#39;t appeal. A typical kid in a book store won&#39;t stop  <br/>\nand look at every book image they pass. The dark colors, the adult  <br/>\nfaces just don&#39;t capture their interest. There&#39;s a reason kid stuff  <br/>\nlooks like kid stuff and it isn&#39;t because adults decided that&#39;s what  <br/>\nkids need. Kids are smarter than that! It&#39;s because kids are  <br/>\nnaturally, biologically attuned to big eyes, bright colors and simple  <br/>\nshapes. Adults have learned from kids what appeals to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt probably wasn&#39;t until she was 9 or 10 when she started seeking out  <br/>\ncartoons on her own -- *still* flipping past anything non-cartoon.  <br/>\nThere weren&#39;t characters biting off penises at 10AM ;-) but I doubt  <br/>\nthe style or tone would have interested her anyway. It looks closer  <br/>\nto adult talking shows that the shows she was looking for. (9 or 10  <br/>\nmight be late to channel flipping. -- Oh, my goodness, she was behind  <br/>\nin her development! ;-) -- but there was so many other things to do  <br/>\nthat she didn&#39;t need to seek out more TV before that any more than  <br/>\nshe needed to seek out more books than she was already enjoying. For  <br/>\nunschoolers TV is just another thing to do, not a center piece to  <br/>\ntheir lives.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I see the<br/>\n&gt; difference between reality and TV but I&#39;m an adult. She is three. I<br/>\n&gt; was afraid she wouldn&#39;t know the difference, that it would impact her<br/>\n&gt; the same regardless of where she saw it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think adults are so worried that kids don&#39;t know that fantasy isn&#39;t  <br/>\nreality that they don&#39;t even consider that kids may think reality is  <br/>\nfantasy ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think as they grow older, it&#39;s not that they separate fantasy  <br/>\n*from* reality but that they that they begin to separate their  <br/>\n*world* into fantasy and reality, if you can see the distinction.  <br/>\nSanta can be part of a child&#39;s world because reality and fantasy are  <br/>\nstill blended together. (Kat is guessing she was 10 or 11 when she  <br/>\nfinally decided Pokemon weren&#39;t real). I suspect kids first pull out  <br/>\nwhat they can see and touch as having a special quality so rather  <br/>\nthan separating their world into fantasy and reality they separate it  <br/>\ninto touchable and not touchable. And though touchable has the  <br/>\nspecial quality of being (relatively) unchanging and what we&#39;d call  <br/>\nreal, not touchable (books, TV, words) has a different quality to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean all kids will feel the same way about &quot;not  <br/>\ntouchable&quot; violence. I didn&#39;t like sad stories as a kid and still  <br/>\ndon&#39;t as an adult. That&#39;s just something I&#39;ve learned about myself by  <br/>\nbeing exposed to sad stories and having the power to avoid stories. I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to be protected from them but I sure appreciate help  <br/>\navoiding them! And that&#39;s something I can do for my daughter. She  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want me to protect her from everything in the world that  <br/>\n*might* have moving skeletons and graphic horror movies. She wants  <br/>\nhelp seeing things she enjoys and avoiding the things she doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nwant to see. But help doesn&#39;t mean me filtering. It means me giving  <br/>\nher information and support.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; probably the same questions that make you all want to bang your head<br/>\n&gt; against a wall<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Questions don&#39;t at all make me bang my head against the wall.  <br/>\nQuestions mean someone is turning ideas over in their head and  <br/>\nthinking. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes me bang my head against the wall is when people have  <br/>\nalready made up their mind and decided we&#39;re wrong and they&#39;re right.  <br/>\nWhen people are in that state, they&#39;re much less likely to listen to  <br/>\nnew ideas with open minds. They read to see if someone is  <br/>\nunderstanding what they say and ignore (or filter through their own  <br/>\nunderstanding) what people are trying to explain. It&#39;s way too often  <br/>\na waste of time to explain anything to them -- though I explain  <br/>\nbecause I know others are reading and may go &quot;I finally get it!&quot; so  <br/>\nthe process is actually useful to other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They work (with psychologists) to get into the minds of<br/>\n&gt; a children. They are a huge industry.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If getting into people&#39;s heads were easy, then there wouldn&#39;t be so  <br/>\nmuch money in it. Companies spend *billions* of dollars trying to get  <br/>\npeople to buy their products. It wouldn&#39;t cost them billions if it  <br/>\nwere easy! (Someone (Bob?) recently said the success rate was like 2%  <br/>\nor something like that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith children raised in mindfully parented homes I bet it&#39;s even  <br/>\nless ;-) But we shouldn&#39;t see commercials as dangerous but as a  <br/>\nsource of -- very biased! -- information. It really didn&#39;t take much  <br/>\ndiscussion for my daughter to pick up how advertisers try to you  <br/>\nbelieve you need their product. (It works better to discuss  <br/>\ncommercials aimed at adults or a niche she isn&#39;t interested in.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust that your chldren are smarter than TV. Just support them and be  <br/>\nthere for them. Talk about stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but I have lost faith in myself somewhere. Perhaps that<br/>\n&gt; is what the whole industry is aiming for?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With support, it doesn&#39;t make any difference what they&#39;re trying to  <br/>\ndo: people are stronger than TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a mindset that children are born bad and that it needs to be  <br/>\ntrained out of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unschooling it helps loads to face children with the belief that  <br/>\nchildren are born good and need help acquiring the skills the  <br/>\nnavigate the world. They&#39;re always doing the best they can with the  <br/>\nskills and knowledge and needs that they have. They just need our  <br/>\nhelp to figure out how to make even better choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a mindset that children are weak and need protected.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it helps to see children as strong who need our help dealing  <br/>\nwith the world. They have the *capacity* within them to handle it.  <br/>\nThey just need our help tapping into it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If this list believes that we as parents can counteract any of the<br/>\n&gt; ill effects the television or anything else brings our children, why<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t we feel the same way about schooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If children *choose* school and know they can come home anytime, if  <br/>\nthe parents fully trust unschooling then that&#39;s a great big immunity  <br/>\nshot against the message that school is the only way to succeed. Kat  <br/>\nwent to second grade for 2 months. That&#39;s how long it took for the  <br/>\nbad parts to outweigh the good parts for her. She *knows* from  <br/>\nexperience that school is bogus. She&#39;s taking an art class at the  <br/>\nhigh school right now, has taken college classes, will take Calculus  <br/>\nat the high school in the fall. From experience she knows the  <br/>\ndifference between learning in a class and learning from real life.  <br/>\nShe has *no* desire to turn over all her time to the school.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor most kids they&#39;re taken way too early from their families, sent  <br/>\nto school where they&#39;re forced to figure out how the world works on  <br/>\ntheir own. It&#39;s not natural for a 6 yo to spend 6 hours on their own  <br/>\nnavigating the world. There&#39;s a reason teens pull away from families:  <br/>\nit&#39;s when they&#39;re biologically ready to do so. But 6 yos need their  <br/>\nfamilies for support. They *shouldn&#39;t* be figuring it out on their  <br/>\nown. Since they still need family, they tend to look for some form of  <br/>\nsubstitute in their peers when forced into school. Their  <br/>\nvulnerability to peer pressure (as well as messages from the world in  <br/>\ngeneral) is because they don&#39;t have the nest to explore from that  <br/>\nthey need.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost parents who send their kids to school surround their kids with a  <br/>\ndifferent message than unschooling parents do. The message is that  <br/>\nschool is necessary, that kids are imperfect as they are and need  <br/>\nmolded into something different, that others know what is better for  <br/>\nthem than the kids (and often the parents) do themselves. If kids  <br/>\nescape negative effects from that message, it&#39;s a miracle. Usually it  <br/>\ntakes years of work and soul searching to get rid of the messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids don&#39;t have those messages to get rid of. They can see  <br/>\nschool for what it is. Some will want to experience it. (Part of  <br/>\nunschooling *is* the idea that we learn better by doing than being  <br/>\ntold what to think about something!) Some won&#39;t see anything that  <br/>\ndraws them. But stopping them from exploring school is as damaging to  <br/>\nfree learning as stopping them from exploring books ... and TV. But  <br/>\nas Kelly said, rather than just saying &quot;Okay,&quot; it&#39;s useful to discuss  <br/>\nwhat they want to get from school. My daughter wanted to go to  <br/>\nkindergarten because she thought she&#39;d be riding the Big Wheels like  <br/>\nshe did in preschool. When she found out they didn&#39;t have Big Wheels  <br/>\nshe decided kindergarten didn&#39;t sound all that great ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Guidance/some additional ?&#39;s","postDate":"1179551624","msgId":23821,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOTY3RUI5QjNDNDkwNy01MUMtNTlBRUBGV00tUjE0LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEExOUQzRDVBLTk3MEUtNEJFNS04RTI0LTRDODE1OUYyOUMxMkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEExOUQzRDVBLTk3MEUtNEJFNS04RTI0LTRDODE1OUYyOUMxMkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23824,"prevInTime":23818,"nextInTime":23822,"topicId":23819,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
