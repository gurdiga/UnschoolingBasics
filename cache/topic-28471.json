If we choose to live on a farm, we need to recognize that *we*<br/>\nthe adults are going to be doing a LOT of work (if it&#39;s to be a working,<br/>\nprimary income maker farm). Kind of the same thinking goes into getting<br/>\na pet - sure, the kids may WANT a dog, but before saying Yes, the<br/>\n*adults* need to understand and recognize that that dog will be around<br/>\nfor many years, possibly even long after the kids have moved away, and<br/>\nbe willing to say &quot;Yes, we adults will be responsible for this living<br/>\ncreatures&#39;s care and well-being. Any help from the kids is a bonus.&quot;<br/>\nInterestingly, what I&#39;ve seen with my DS (who is 9 1/2 and was 5 when we<br/>\ngot our dog) is that by us shouldering the responsibility for the dog&#39;s<br/>\ncare, he&#39;s picked up taking care of some of the tasks *without* it being<br/>\na burden to him. We have no *expectation* that he&#39;ll do it, but he does<br/>\noften handle feeding the dog in the evenings, as well as feeding the<br/>\nfish (two tropical tanks) in the morning if he&#39;s up before I feed them.<br/>\nSometimes, now, we&#39;ll ask him to handle one of those tasks if we truly<br/>\nneed the assist (like if I&#39;m coming in from work with a pile of mail, my<br/>\npurse, my lunch bag, and a sack of groceries I picked up to round out<br/>\ndinner - I just don&#39;t have a convenient hand to -also- feed the dog).<br/>\nAnd, he does it without a gripe because he knows that when we<br/>\nspecifically ask, there&#39;s a real reason for asking for the help, not<br/>\njust &quot;he has to learn responsibility so we&#39;ll give him this chore&quot;. Am I<br/>\nmaking any sense?
