Our 6 & 8 year old are finishing out this year of school (we also have a 2 year old), but I am so excited to transition our family into this. It&#39;s a very recent discovery for us and the whole philosophy, though a little uncomfortable at first, resonates so well. I feel incredibly excited to be able to offer this to my kids. I&#39;m also grateful for this community. Reading the comments here feels reassuring and supportive. It seems a bit of a lonely road pursuing something so out of the main stream and finding a community of like minded people is a gift. <br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\nBrette</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48514,"nextTopicId":48550}}
