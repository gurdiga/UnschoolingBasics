You&#39;re totally wrong&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree with Pam.<br/>\nHuman beings are born altruistic...I believe that. I think we filter<br/>\nchildren&#39;s behavior through the adult lense and it looks totally<br/>\ndifferent. A 2.5 y.o. does NOT have a whole bunch of ability for<br/>\nempathy just yet. She will in her own time.<br/>\nShe wanted that baby OUT of her house and throwing the bottle was her<br/>\nonly form of communication!! When I read that I&#39;m thinking<br/>\n&quot;malice????? NO, she just wants those people to LEAVE!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s sweet and perfect and whole and wonderful, exactly how she is<br/>\ntoday. When she starts hitting, love the heck out of her, move her<br/>\naway from the target and tell her how much you adore her and you can&#39;t<br/>\nlet her hurt anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour dh has been coercive with her, I&#39;d hit him too!! Have him try<br/>\ntreating YOU the way he&#39;s been treating her and see if you don&#39;t feel<br/>\nlike smacking the guy.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s very little. She doesn&#39;t have many tools just yet. LISTEN to her<br/>\nand back off of playdates for a while....she&#39;s not going to do this<br/>\nforever.
