My kids have been <br/>\nhelping in the kitchen since the could stand on a chair and slice <br/>\nolives with an egg slicer!  Not that I force them, it&#39;s more of a <br/>\ncase of them wanting to be in there with me.  I have tons of tools <br/>\n(mostly Pampered  Chef) that my kids all know how to use.  Food <br/>\nchoppers, cheese graters (like the kind that Olive  Garden used to <br/>\nuse to grate parmesan cheese), egg slicers, measuring cups, <br/>\nmeasuring spoons, bamboo spoons for stirring, real knives and <br/>\ncutting boards, rolling pins, flour sugar shakers, etc.  My kids are <br/>\n*constantly* wanting to cook or help cook.  The agreement in today&#39;s <br/>\nhousehold is that if they help me clear the work counter they can <br/>\nmake cookies.  There is *always* a project of some sort to do!  The <br/>\nlike helping with dinner, lunches and breakfasts.  I&#39;ve taught my <br/>\nkids to do many things on their own so they are more self-<br/>\nsufficient.  They know how to make ramen in the microwave and the <br/>\nolder two can make mashed potatoes and scrambled eggs and mac-n-<br/>\ncheese.  They all know how to make toast and grilled cheese <br/>\nsandwiches.  I work outside the home on various evenings (I&#39;m a <br/>\nPampered Chef consultant - so yes; cooking is my life LOL!) and I do <br/>\nmany of the things that Deb suggested.  I make meals ahead of time, <br/>\nhave something that their dad can prepare, plan in a meal out or a <br/>\nmeal brought in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd cooking is such a wonderful &quot;tool&quot; to enlightenment.  My kids <br/>\nhave looked up the history of spaghetti and how to grow pumpkins <br/>\njust because of cooking.  The internet is a wonderful &quot;tool&quot; for <br/>\nunschoolers because they can easily allow children to go from <br/>\none &quot;tangent&quot; to another.  They start looking up the history of <br/>\nspaghetti and that leads them to a website about Italy which leads <br/>\nthem to a website about the Medici family which leads them to a <br/>\nwebsite about the plague in Europe which leads them to a website <br/>\nabout France which leads them to the History Channel and voila!  The <br/>\nkids are in front of the television watching a show about the French <br/>\nRevolution!  All because we decided to have spaghetti for dinner.  :-<br/>\n)<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"Deb Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] mornings","postDate":"1107447835","msgId":4844,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMjAzLjA5MjM1Ni4yMzkyLjIuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4841,"nextInTopic":4849,"prevInTime":4843,"nextInTime":4845,"topicId":4839,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***When and wheredoes the school work come in with homeschooling???*** Homeschooling is different than unschooling.

Unschooling is just what it<br/>\nsounds like.  Not schooling.  So, what will happen in your unschooling<br/>\nlife with your children will probably never look like &quot;school work.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can read more about unschooling at www.sandradodd.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re worried about not being able to make time in the day for &quot;school<br/>\nwork.&quot;  I hope you can find time to read more about unschooling.  Not<br/>\nonly to see if it&#39;s right for you but to gain some better understanding<br/>\nabout how living with your children as happily as possible can be the<br/>\nfoundation for all the learning they will naturally do their whole lives<br/>\nlong. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really decide unschooling is the right thing for your family your<br/>\nfocus can (and will) shift from trying to make time for school work, to<br/>\nvaluing every moment you spend happily with your kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n***The little time we get between 10:30-12 is spent fussing over who <br/>\nneeds my attention. Because the 10 year old wants to have more of my <br/>\nattention than the smaller children.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds not so much like a sleep time issue as it does a &quot;quality<br/>\ntime with mom&quot; issue.  If the choice you&#39;re making to direct their sleep<br/>\nand have them waking at a certain time is creating a stressful morning<br/>\nfor you all, you won&#39;t have the quality of time shared that you otherwise<br/>\nmight.   I understand your desire to have more time with them before you<br/>\nhave to go to work.  But maybe instead of focusing on the amount of<br/>\nhours, focus on the quality of the hours.  A shorter, happy interaction<br/>\nwith you is worth more than a longer stressful one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son started sleeping later at about that age.  He now stays up until<br/>\ntwo or three some mornings and sleeps until anywhere between ten and<br/>\nnoon.  I think, in part, a body that age is beginning it&#39;s transition to<br/>\nteen hood and I believe teens require more sleep time.  However, even in<br/>\nyoung children sleep requirements can change often and drastically.  Your<br/>\nten year old is really the only one who can decide how much sleep he or<br/>\nshe needs. <br/>\n<br/>\n***Also if I don&#39;t think of something to do between those times, the 10 <br/>\nyear old either wants to watch TV or paint or play games on the <br/>\ncomputer.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think those are good, creative solutions.  All of those choices are<br/>\n&quot;something to do&quot;.  All of those things are valuable.  You can show<br/>\ninterest in what your ten year old is watching, painting or playing.  You<br/>\ncan listen to his or her ideas and excitement about what&#39;s going on, you<br/>\ncan share in the fun and you will be doing something together.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I have to start cooking by 3pm.I work in the evenings when my <br/>\nhusband comes home so I want to do things with them in the mornings.***<br/>\n<br/>\nCan your husband share the cooking?  Can he cook a few days and you cook<br/>\nthe other days?  <br/>\nCan you cook on weekends and put food in the freezer that can then be<br/>\nyanked out and heated in the microwave?<br/>\nCan you choose two or three days a week where you eat commercially<br/>\nprepared stuff that won&#39;t require a lot of your time? <br/>\nSend out for Pizza?  Have your husband grab some take out on his way<br/>\nhome?<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing more than one option could open up two or three or more days a<br/>\nweek for you to spend more quality time with your kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could have music playing and you could all be dancing while you cook,<br/>\nor a movie on that you can all watch and talk about, or you could invent<br/>\nsome silly game to play while you&#39;re cooking and your kids are nearby so<br/>\nthat you *will* be spending time with them even though you&#39;re doing the<br/>\nother things you want to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196090915,"authorName":"J.
