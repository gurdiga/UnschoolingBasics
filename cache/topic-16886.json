Some might work and some I wish would work.  We have been thinking about a rock wall ( I would love to see your pictures Danielle, I&#39;ve seen the ones of the outside wall) and mini trampoline already and sounds like they would be good.  We might do a video game system next year and will look into  mat.  I looked into the ikea hand rings and they do not ship them via internet, but I love the idea.  I think a ladder on the ceiling would be fantastic, but completely undoable with this house.  We do not have a flat piece of ground for a big trampoline and I&#39;ve heard it will often void home-owners insurance, be sure to check.  We already ride bikes, scooters, and roller skates in the basement.  I&#39;m trying to mentally set up an obstacle course so I will have ideas.  Next time I&#39;m out we will chack for carpet skates.  I&#39;ve kept all the suggestions and will try them all out.<br/>\n <br/>\n Thanks,<br/>\n Amanda<br/>\n Eli 5 Samuel 3.5<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n           <br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Everyone is raving about the  all-new Yahoo!
