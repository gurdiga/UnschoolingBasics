We talked about that  <br/>\n- how he has to register and what the consequences are if he does not - and to <br/>\n be clear in his reasons to or not to register. I am hoping, to be fully <br/>\nhonest  here, that I can raise Julian, who just turned 5, to be a Conscientious <br/>\nObjector  because of MY fears of the draft, war, death...and I know those are MY <br/>\nfears.  I&#39;m not sure how to cope with that. I read an article/story in <br/>\nMothering  Magazine about a child raises as such and they kept his peace activist <br/>\nworks and  stuff he did in a portfolio, just in case. But would I be forcing my <br/>\nideas on my  son? And yet, is it possible for me to raise a child that would <br/>\nWANT to go...?  (as in the way I am raising the kids, not &quot;possible&quot; in the <br/>\nliteral sense - I&#39;m  not sure I&#39;m saying that right) Gosh, this brought up a lot <br/>\nfor me! Wow! <br/>\n <br/>\nI have the site on registering, btw...and that story I think is online, if  <br/>\nanyone wants to see it, I&#39;ll be glad to hunt it down and post a link (to both). <br/>\n <br/>\nAs for your son, Linda, I *think* that certain &quot;mental conditions&quot; do  indeed <br/>\nsave a person from the draft. What a phrase, huh? But your story above  <br/>\nreminded me of that Mothering article (which I can&#39;t remember the outcome, but  it <br/>\nmay help you out). I&#39;d also suggest just looking into reasons one can use  <br/>\nagainst the armed forces for not being drafted.

I have a nearly 16 yr old son who plans on starting college f/t next year. He has no desire to go into the military, and I suspect that it would be truly devastating for him -- he is one who would be at high risk for<br/>\nPTSD. He will likely have his BS at a young age -- and if there is a draft, would he not then be draftable? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  There is a lot of talk about a draft now.  I&#39;d be okay with that IF there were more options for non-military service, say for aid agencies and the like.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  That said, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard about draft potential recently, thru my Mom who has a friend on the local Draft Board (which still exists even without a current draft)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  the current thought is that when a draft is instituted, this time around they&#39;ll choose older recruits -- starting with 22yo&#39;s and working down to younger people, so those in the 22yo age range are most likely to be drafted first (oh peachy - my oldest is 22!).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  the only deferment for college will be to allow draftees to finish the semester -- no more staying college til the draft/war ends.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  no marriage dependent deferments -- they won&#39;t care how many kids (or wives&lt;g&gt;) a draftee has.  After all, his wife is likely to work, too, so no big deal there.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  There will be CO (conscientious objector) status given still, but it&#39;s hard to get, and won&#39;t likely be given to men who chose not to register in the first place. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;ve spoken a bit with a cousin of my dh who offered to help me set up CO folders for our younger boys (apparently the draft board wants to see a record of one&#39;s pacifist leanings) but haven&#39;t gotten around to it yet.  Cousin is a Quaker and said their long history of CO status makes them a good resource for how to assemble a CO case for a draftee. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I don&#39;t worry so much about Andy -- we&#39;ve never had him diagnosed, tho we know he&#39;d land somewhere on the autism spectrum, but we&#39;d happily have him labeled if that would keep him out of a draft.  Dan, tho, is perfectly *normal* healthy, physically precocious -- an officer&#39;s dream!  And of course, Will is already draftable age -- but we have a back-up plan in place for him already.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  I don&#39;t know the details about that sort of thing, but I know I would fight heaven and hell to keep my only child safe!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  Ultimately, tho, dh&#39;s plan is that we&#39;d leave the country with our boys.  He&#39;s even explored how he could find work in Canada soon.  He grew up in the specter of Vietnam (had a draft card in &#39;73, but didn&#39;t get called up) and in those days wondered whether he&#39;d choose Mexico or Canada, because there was no way he was going to Vietnam.  And he grew up the child of a career Air Force officer!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBoardwalk for $500? In 2007?

I have a<br/>\nnearly 16 yr old son who plans on starting college f/t next year.  He<br/>\nhas no desire to go into the military, and I suspect that it would be<br/>\ntruly devastating for him -- he is one who would be at high risk for<br/>\nPTSD.  He will likely have his BS at a young age -- and if there is a<br/>\ndraft, would he not then be draftable?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know the details about that sort of thing, but I know I would<br/>\nfight heaven and hell to keep my only child safe!<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":220041937,"authorName":"hbmccarty","from":"hbmccarty &lt;hbmccarty@...&gt;","profile":"heather13068","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] kind of intro rambling thing","postDate":"1190723505","msgId":26472,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2RjhGRkIxLjEwMjA4MDJAdHdjbnkucnIuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDcwOTI1MDEyNnUxYWIxNGI1ZHBiNmQ0MzMwYjlkMDlhZDg5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDcwOTI1MDEyNnUxYWIxNGI1ZHBiNmQ0MzMwYjlkMDlhZDg5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26471,"nextInTopic":26476,"prevInTime":26471,"nextInTime":26473,"topicId":26471,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Faith- I haven t been on this list too long but it has been SO helpful.

There are a <br/>\nlot of really great things about it and it is totally up to my kids <br/>\nwhether they attend on any given day. They are both very social and it <br/>\nreally is a good thing (I have to keep repeating this to myself.).<br/>\n<br/>\nHOWEVER- I have quite a bit of difficulty being there at times. It seems <br/>\nthat the families are moving even more towards Waldorf homeschooling and <br/>\nschool at home. Especially parents of young children, which is difficult <br/>\nto observe. My daughter attended one class of a Waldorf program- and <br/>\nsays- I don&#39;t think I am a Waldorf kind of person. (Me either!)<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I had one mom tell me her son was unhappy with the assignments <br/>\nshe gave him this week- as he had been choosing his own up until now. <br/>\nHer reason was that he had to be prepared for college in case the draft <br/>\nwas reinstated. I told her my theory of college preparation which is <br/>\nthat my kids, if and when they decide to go to college will be able to <br/>\nstart doing any preparation needed at that point in time whatever it <br/>\nmight be, if anything. Probably should have kept my mouth shut. It is <br/>\ncompletely amazing the rationalizations people will come up with for <br/>\ncontrolling their children. Another mom whose older son in now in high <br/>\nschool told us that her son does his school work more readily now than <br/>\nwhen he was home schooled- this is someone who had claimed to be an <br/>\nunschooler. I walked away from this one!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am involved in administration at the learning center so I think it <br/>\nworks to just stick with that subject and other neutral ones and stay <br/>\noff homeschooling altogether.
