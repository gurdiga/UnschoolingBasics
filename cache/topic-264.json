I asked and the library ordered it from another branch and I&#39;ll pick it up later today.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>DD had an idea to redecorate her room -- I drove us to Jo-Ann Fabrics. She picked out a really wonderful combination&nbsp;of fabrics and I helped her sew as needed, trying to do only what she is unable (so far) to do.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Magazines/fliers with books and games and other stuff come and I hand them to the kids and then order what they choose.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>I drive to the library and am available to check out when DD finishes selecting her books.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>I see an interesting website on line. I think it&#39;s interesting anyway. I save it to Favorites and let the kids know it is there is they want to pursue it. There is about a... hmmmm ... hard to judge, maybe 20% rate of them following up on whatever I strew on the computer.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>We see a word posted on a sign we drive by all the time -- someone at the local U-Store-It place has a brain and posts trivia questions on their marquee. Anyway, I remind DS to look it up when we get home -- he googles -- discovers it has nothing to do with what we thought but then spends the next hour with DD browsing around a site on different psychiatric terms. My job? Leave them the heck alone. :)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>So the strewing here is haphazard -- in addition to the above, the house is just one big strew -- books and mags and&nbsp;supplies for different projects are readily available on shelves or in bins or the computer is always on or whatever is needed is at hand if possible -- all within the bounds of the budget! and our reality, of course (we know all about saving up for something and working around Dad&#39;s erratic work schedule and when something is just too darned expensive).</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>For me, it&#39;s better to have a messy house and have that graph paper available when DS wants to do a geometry magic trick he just read about -- at 10 PM, when he seems to come alive, just as I am fading. :) </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>What was the topic? :) How I strew -- I try to help without pushing. It&#39;s a balance, for me anyway. And changes constantly. The kids are 11 and 9 now -- so I strew differently than when they were 7 and 5, or whatever.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Nance</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>In a message dated 6/2/2004 7:15:02 PM Eastern Daylight Time, unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com writes:</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote style=\"PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:blue 2px solid;\"><font face=\"Arial\"><em>Yeah, this &quot;strewing&quot; thing is different for each of us.
