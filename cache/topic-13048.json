Even<br/>\nthe language that they children and mother used did not seem &quot;unschoolish&quot;<br/>\nIt sounded very &quot;non-curriculum homeschooling&quot; which is different from<br/>\nunschooling.  There were words like, &quot;things that I have to do&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;personal tutor.&quot;  I can&#39;t imagine hearing one of my kids or one of Ren&#39;s<br/>\nkids refering to us as their &quot;personal tutors.&quot;  She also seemed very<br/>\ncollege-goal oriented for her children.  If this is not really a true<br/>\nrepresentation of how this mother unschools I would love to know what all<br/>\nthey cut out because it felt very un-unschoolish to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the rant was STUPID.
