The<br/>\nmore we hear how langusge is supposed to sound, the better we get at<br/>\nit ourselves!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nReading is one way.....talking to people, playing games, watching<br/>\nmovies and listening to language (songs/poems etc..) are ALL ways to<br/>\ndevelop language skills.<br/>\nAnd the bottom line is that no matter how much you do of the above,<br/>\nsome people are going to have fantastic language skills and others<br/>\nnever will. One of those &quot;7 intelligences&quot; things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpelling and writing skills are overrated. They&#39;re really important<br/>\nfor some people, but if a person struggles with those things is it a<br/>\nsure sing of failure? Not at all. We all have different hard<br/>\nwiring...we all find some things we excel at naturally and other<br/>\nthings seem foreign and difficult no matter how much we try.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as grammar, I really have never had to figure out what an<br/>\nadverb/adjective or noun are except when playing &quot;mad libs&quot; with my<br/>\nkids. I LOVE to write. I write poems, articles and stories. I NEVER<br/>\npay attention to grammar....I just know when something sounds &quot;right&quot;<br/>\nand when it&#39;s off. That&#39;s why I have friends do the editing for<br/>\nme...I&#39;m NOT good at that part!!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9910,"nextTopicId":9907}}
