I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; do want to say that I completely respect folks for whom that works <br/>\n </span></blockquote>out and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for whom no other issues arise!  In our house we have found several <br/>\n </span></blockquote>issues -<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in addition to the one Ren talked about - the fact that you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; your sensitive children watch things that would traumatize them and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>give<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; them nightmares for weeks (and my daughter gets too scared to watch <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Disney<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; movies so that is a big consideration around here).  For us this is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>not just<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; adult material.  My daughter or son may pick out a video to watch <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; scares the other one - even the sound of it or the &quot;knowledge that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the one<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that scares me is on&quot; is enough to terrify my very sensitive <br/>\n </span></blockquote>daughter, or<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; even my not quite so sensitive son.  So we end up talking a lot <br/>\n </span></blockquote>about<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; considering the other person&#39;s feelings.  Since my daughter is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>five, she is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; able to better empathize and do in any situation what she would <br/>\n </span></blockquote>like done if<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; she were in the other person&#39;s shoes.  With my three year old son, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>who does<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not have that level, I sometimes have to &quot;help&quot; him find a solution <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; fair (since he thinks it&#39;s fine for him to watch what scares my dd <br/>\n </span></blockquote>but to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; stop her from watching what scares him).  Right now we are doing <br/>\n </span></blockquote>fairly well<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with finding videos we all like, or agreeing to special time with <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mama in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the farthest away room possible while the &quot;scary&quot; video is on, but <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sometimes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that doesn&#39;t work and I can&#39;t see that protecting the video <br/>\n </span></blockquote>watching child&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; right to choose the video over the right of the child who finds it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>scary to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have a safe feeling emotional environment is right.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another issue we&#39;ve struggled with is I have discovered that I as a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>person<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; require a certain amount of peace and quiet in my living <br/>\n </span></blockquote>environment.  This<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is very different from my husband who loves having the noise of TV <br/>\n </span></blockquote>or the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; radio on in the background.  I find after a time the noise of the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>TV (and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for me that includes &quot;visual&quot; noise that catches my eye when I go <br/>\n </span></blockquote>by) or the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; radio gives me headaches, makes me cranky and just drives me to the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>point I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; want to crawl out of my skin.  I should point out that we live in a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>very<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; small two bedroom house, so it&#39;s difficult to find space to get <br/>\n </span></blockquote>away from<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that.  Interestingly enough since I have brought this issue up for<br/>\n&gt; discussion with my children, my daughter has voiced similar <br/>\n </span></blockquote>feelings and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; asked for more overall quiet herself.  My son went through a period <br/>\n </span></blockquote>around<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the age of just turning 3 where he wanted to watch videos all the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>time and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it was an issue with noise for both me and my daughter.  In this <br/>\n </span></blockquote>way, I view<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; TV as different from books (to which it is so often compared in <br/>\n </span></blockquote>unschooling<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; posts) - it has an output into the general environment in which we <br/>\n </span></blockquote>all live<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that does impact me (and it seems my dd) in a way that we need <br/>\n </span></blockquote>honored.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other issue we&#39;ve decided to form an agreement around (and I do <br/>\n </span></blockquote>believe<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in talking and forming agreements based on everyone&#39;s feelings <br/>\n </span></blockquote>instead of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; imposing arbitrary limits, although that ability is limited in kids <br/>\n </span></blockquote>younger<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; than about the age of 4 unless they can empathize really early) is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>when they<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ask to invite other kids over to play, then by the time the other <br/>\n </span></blockquote>kids get<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; here, five minutes into it one of them wants to watch a video.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then the kid<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; who got invited over gets mad because they came to play and they <br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t want<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to watch a video, or not that video (which if we watch the ones <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they all<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; want in succession turns into a long bout of TV watching during <br/>\n </span></blockquote>which the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; children who&#39;s video is not on resent the fact that the other kids <br/>\n </span></blockquote>are not<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; available to them to play).

We decided it wasn&#39;t fair to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>invite<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; someone over with the expectation of playing, then turn on a video, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; made more sense to have a general agreement for the TV to go off <br/>\n </span></blockquote>when<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; someone comes over to play, unless we have specifically invited <br/>\n </span></blockquote>them over to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; watch a certain thing that has been agreed to ahead of time, and to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>ask them<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (and by this I mean her cousins whom she sees regularly) to do the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>same if<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; we go to their house to play.

Right now we all<br/>\nseem to be really in sync and content about all of our needs regarding the<br/>\nTV so I&#39;m thinking somehow it has worked out so far.  I will say that<br/>\nreading your statement above about arbitrary versus agreed upon limits made<br/>\nme quite relieved since I had gotten the impression - primarily from another<br/>\nunschooling email list I left - that if my kids had anything other than<br/>\nunlimited access to all of TV, I was somehow missing the point and missing<br/>\nthe boat and I felt quite excluded.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My kids are 13, 16, and 19 now.

I have been up and down the charts on TV issues, and certainly myself<br/>\nstruggled with whether there is some kind of &quot;instrinsic&quot; good or badness to<br/>\nTV and how I feel about my children watching it all day.  Having read a lot<br/>\nof posts on this and another unschooling message board, I have come to feel<br/>\nthat it is in fact more useful for me to see it as a tool - one that can<br/>\ncertainly be abused (I have definitely seen folks who use it as a kind of<br/>\ndrug to shut problems and the world out) or used well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, since I have put the &quot;good/bad&quot; issue to the side, I have come to<br/>\nsee other issues with TV that seem at least in our house to require more<br/>\nthan just letting each kid watch whatever they want whenever they want.  I<br/>\ndo want to say that I completely respect folks for whom that works out and<br/>\nfor whom no other issues arise!  In our house we have found several issues -<br/>\nin addition to the one Ren talked about - the fact that you wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nyour sensitive children watch things that would traumatize them and give<br/>\nthem nightmares for weeks (and my daughter gets too scared to watch Disney<br/>\nmovies so that is a big consideration around here).  For us this is not just<br/>\nadult material.  My daughter or son may pick out a video to watch that<br/>\nscares the other one - even the sound of it or the &quot;knowledge that the one<br/>\nthat scares me is on&quot; is enough to terrify my very sensitive daughter, or<br/>\neven my not quite so sensitive son.  So we end up talking a lot about<br/>\nconsidering the other person&#39;s feelings.  Since my daughter is five, she is<br/>\nable to better empathize and do in any situation what she would like done if<br/>\nshe were in the other person&#39;s shoes.  With my three year old son, who does<br/>\nnot have that level, I sometimes have to &quot;help&quot; him find a solution that&#39;s<br/>\nfair (since he thinks it&#39;s fine for him to watch what scares my dd but to<br/>\nstop her from watching what scares him).  Right now we are doing fairly well<br/>\nwith finding videos we all like, or agreeing to special time with Mama in<br/>\nthe farthest away room possible while the &quot;scary&quot; video is on, but sometimes<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t work and I can&#39;t see that protecting the video watching child&#39;s<br/>\nright to choose the video over the right of the child who finds it scary to<br/>\nhave a safe feeling emotional environment is right.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother issue we&#39;ve struggled with is I have discovered that I as a person<br/>\nrequire a certain amount of peace and quiet in my living environment.  This<br/>\nis very different from my husband who loves having the noise of TV or the<br/>\nradio on in the background.  I find after a time the noise of the TV (and<br/>\nfor me that includes &quot;visual&quot; noise that catches my eye when I go by) or the<br/>\nradio gives me headaches, makes me cranky and just drives me to the point I<br/>\nwant to crawl out of my skin.  I should point out that we live in a very<br/>\nsmall two bedroom house, so it&#39;s difficult to find space to get away from<br/>\nthat.  Interestingly enough since I have brought this issue up for<br/>\ndiscussion with my children, my daughter has voiced similar feelings and<br/>\nasked for more overall quiet herself.  My son went through a period around<br/>\nthe age of just turning 3 where he wanted to watch videos all the time and<br/>\nit was an issue with noise for both me and my daughter.  In this way, I view<br/>\nTV as different from books (to which it is so often compared in unschooling<br/>\nposts) - it has an output into the general environment in which we all live<br/>\nthat does impact me (and it seems my dd) in a way that we need honored.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other issue we&#39;ve decided to form an agreement around (and I do believe<br/>\nin talking and forming agreements based on everyone&#39;s feelings instead of<br/>\nimposing arbitrary limits, although that ability is limited in kids younger<br/>\nthan about the age of 4 unless they can empathize really early) is when they<br/>\nask to invite other kids over to play, then by the time the other kids get<br/>\nhere, five minutes into it one of them wants to watch a video.  Then the kid<br/>\nwho got invited over gets mad because they came to play and they don&#39;t want<br/>\nto watch a video, or not that video (which if we watch the ones they all<br/>\nwant in succession turns into a long bout of TV watching during which the<br/>\nchildren who&#39;s video is not on resent the fact that the other kids are not<br/>\navailable to them to play).  We had long talks about this which involved<br/>\nfeeling out how my dd would feel if she went to someone else&#39;s house to play<br/>\nand the video situation happened.  We decided it wasn&#39;t fair to invite<br/>\nsomeone over with the expectation of playing, then turn on a video, and it<br/>\nmade more sense to have a general agreement for the TV to go off when<br/>\nsomeone comes over to play, unless we have specifically invited them over to<br/>\nwatch a certain thing that has been agreed to ahead of time, and to ask them<br/>\n(and by this I mean her cousins whom she sees regularly) to do the same if<br/>\nwe go to their house to play.  This agreement has worked out really well and<br/>\neven my 3 year old now who couldn&#39;t really get it at first now gleefully<br/>\npops up to turn it off when someone arrives to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess I am saying that beyond issues of intrinsic goodness and badness<br/>\nof TV it does to me seem to have other impacts in our house which have been<br/>\nimportant to discuss and arrange some type of agreements around so that<br/>\neveryone&#39;s feelings and choices can be honored as much as possible when they<br/>\ncan be so different.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren","from":"&quot;Ren&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"evil tv?","postDate":"1087392310","msgId":752,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNjE2LjA2MjUyMS4yMTU0MS4xMzM0QHdlYm1haWwyOC5ueWMudW50ZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":753,"prevInTime":751,"nextInTime":753,"topicId":752,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yeah, I admit I do kindof see the TV and also advertising and media as an evil...I hate having to tell Will what all the things they are advertising are.
