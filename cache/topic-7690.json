That would <br/>\nbe tough for us, though, if it&#39;s moved to VT.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here goes my super-quick intro:  I&#39;m Jenn Parr, from Virginia, mom <br/>\nto four girls.  We have wholeheartedly embraced our unschooling lives <br/>\njust over the past 9-10 months (before that we unschooled &quot;in the <br/>\ncloset&quot; and had a few workbooks &quot;in progress&quot;, just in case anyone <br/>\nasked, you know!).  We&#39;re (all of us) into music BIG time, Shelby (12) <br/>\nis learning guitar, Tori (7) and Ashlyn (6) are learning piano.  <br/>\nOutside of playing instruments, there is always music of some sort <br/>\ncoming from one of our rooms.  We listen to all kinds:  opera, Broadway <br/>\nmusicals, Phish, Rufus Wainwright, classical (Ashlyn&#39;s fave, usually), <br/>\npunk, bluegrass, world music, classic rock, even country!! (though not <br/>\nMY personal choice, Shelby and Tori like it)! ;-)  Other current <br/>\ninterests (and these can/will change at the drop of a hat) include:  <br/>\nwriting stories, reading the HP series, the Narnia series, cooking, <br/>\nsoccer, Bratz dolls, board games as well as PS2 (We Love Katamari!), <br/>\nGameCube (Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, etc.), and GameBoy games, <br/>\nSculpey art, watercolors, raking leaves, playing with little sis (Lolo) <br/>\nand our kitten, learning chess, cooking veggie recipes, watching <br/>\nArrested Development and Family Guy, reading from &quot;A Cartoon History of <br/>\nthe World&quot;, drawing Manga, playing Neopets and Runescape online, etc., <br/>\netc., etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my younger daughters (Ashlyn, 6 and Lolo, 3) have been <br/>\ndiagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.  It was probably Ashlyn&#39;s <br/>\ndiagnosis that made me start reading more, questioning more about how <br/>\nwe &quot;teach&quot; our &quot;special needs&quot; children.  I couldn&#39;t imagine &quot;training&quot; <br/>\nher to be &quot;normal&quot;...in my mommy eyes, she was already perfect, but all <br/>\nthe &quot;experts&quot; saw a child who needed to be fixed.  To be more normal.  <br/>\nYuck...what&#39;s so great about NORMAL, anyway?  ;-)  So, as her Mom, <br/>\nI &quot;un-diagnosed&quot; her, so that she was just Ash, an amazingly bright, <br/>\nwith-it, funny, compassionate child who could do anything she set out <br/>\nto do, but didn&#39;t HAVE to do anything she didn&#39;t want to do.  Our &quot;un-<br/>\ndiagnosis&quot; gradually led me to UNschooling (for the whole family), and <br/>\nhere we are today.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve already learned so much reading here, and I hope to learn and grow <br/>\neven more.  I recommend this list (plus a few others) to EVERYONE I <br/>\nknow who is embarking on this wondrous journey, and I look forward to <br/>\nsharing more of our lives and our joys with you all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for having me,<br/>\n<br/>\nJenn in Virginia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185316150,"authorName":"nrskay","from":"&quot;nrskay&quot; &lt;okmardesich@...&gt;","profile":"nrskay","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: In a fog/Update & Question","postDate":"1132677308","msgId":7885,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRsdmhicys3bWZtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDN0JEOEJCOThCRUMzMC1FRDgtQThDQE1CTEstUjA1LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7871,"nextInTopic":7914,"prevInTime":7884,"nextInTime":7886,"topicId":7690,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... the ... the book The Teenage Liberation Handbook by Grace Llewellyn a great book.

Around here, we say, &quot;Every day is Saturday, and every month is July.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nRent movies (Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off, for starters! &lt;G&gt;). Do movie verticals---like all the Johnny Depp movies in order. All the Susan Sarandon movies. Or all Hitchcock. Or all movies with horses in them---just pick and actor/director/time period/subject and just watch---in your PJs, with pizza delivered and plenty of popcorn. Maybe for days on end.<br/>\n <br/>\nPack up and GOOOO. Spend a week at Williamsburg or Gettysburg or the Grand Canyon. Get a cheap hotel at the beach or in the mountains. Visit sweet, non-judgmental grandparents or cousins or godmothers for a few days. Or hell, get in touch with some of us unschoolers and roadtrip a few states away! &lt;G&gt; We ALWAYS love to meet/host travelling unschoolers!<br/>\n <br/>\nPick up a new hobby: beekeeping, puppy-raising a guide dog puppy, butterfly gardening, learning magic, playing an instrument, cycling (road &/or mountain), Japanese cooking, making ATCs, playing duplicate bridge. Be interested! Be interesting! (All those have been things picked up by someone in our family in the last few years.)<br/>\n <br/>\nOne of the big problems we had was the schooled friends. They&#39;d tell Cameron he was going to be stupid, never get a job, etc. But Cam was 12. By 16, most of her friends already know how lame high school IS, so they probably won&#39;t bother her as much.<br/>\n <br/>\nAttend a conference---either the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference (2006 in Albuquerque, NM) or a local/regional conference that&#39;s nearby. These are GREAT for you, your husband, and your daughter! Life-changing!<br/>\n <br/>\nNot Back to School Camp---two on the west coast (OR) and one on the east (VT). Going to NBTSC would put her in touch with unschoolers from around the country. They are invaluable for the contacts and for knowing she&#39;s not alone---that *many* people live this lifestyle and are incredibly unique and exciting and full of life. The friends Cameron made there this year are priceless!

I know they won&#39;t...not that <br/>\nI&#39;m not willing to try again.  <br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nRead it TO them. I read TLH to Cameron when we were vacationing in the mountains one week. He had <br/>\nlots of questions---esp since he was still just starting out.<br/>\n <br/>\nFinding other unschoolers would be a BIG help.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI plan to request both that book and the other book, &quot;Real Lives&quot;, <br/>\nthat was recommended.  Our library Mile program is down right now, <br/>\nand that is how I would have to request both books as they are not <br/>\navailable through our county co-op.  I may try going in to see the <br/>\nlibrarian or finding them to buy, though.  Any suggestions as where <br/>\nto purchase them Online?<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nAmazon and half.com, but if you have the $$ and can support the author, you can get it directly from her. If <br/>\nyou call, you&#39;ll probably talk with Maia, who is happy to take your order. But you can order online too.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - How do you all handle life when it seems each and every child, <br/>\nwe have SEVEN, has a pressing need at the same time.  I feel SO <br/>\nexhausted!  On top of that I struggle with pangs of guilt for not <br/>\nbeing able to dedicate the amount of time required to make progress <br/>\nwith pressing situations, as they seem to be arising daily around <br/>\nhere.  How do you resolve pressing issues when they are coming at <br/>\nyou like rain drops?  Anyone have a formula for cloning one&#39;s <br/>\nself?  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nSorry. I have two that are eight years apart. I can divide myself between them pretty well. <br/>\n <br/>\nBut I DO have a zillion other things that take my time. I tend to get up a little earlier. I can <br/>\nsometimes grab a nap in the afternoons if I need it. But I can put aside the pesky *extras* I take on---<br/>\nnot my kids.

I have a situation to ponder that I would really appreciate your input on.

I have a situation to ponder that I would really <br/>\nappreciate your input on.  I&#39;m sure I raised a similar question last <br/>\nyear as this situation is not new.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little history...<br/>\n<br/>\nPat and I have been together for almost 10 years.  We were recently <br/>\nmarried, so now I&#39;m officially step-mom to five children in addition <br/>\nto being mother to two, nana to one...soon to be nana to two more.  <br/>\nAnyway, needless to say ALL of the children have been raised as if <br/>\nthey were my own.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe four oldest went through public school and are young adults <br/>\nnow.  Two of them live on their own, and one is preparing to venture <br/>\nout soon.  Plus, we have our oldest back home expecting her first <br/>\nchild and anticipating bed rest in the next month or two.  Of the <br/>\nremaining three children there are two in public school, Pat&#39;s two <br/>\nyoungest, and one unschooler, my youngest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love nothing more than to bring the two youngest home.  The <br/>\nbiggest issue is with our youngest girl, Amie.  She is the reason <br/>\nfor my post.  Last year was a tough year for our family.  Things <br/>\nseem to touch her in a different way.  She will be 16 in March, is <br/>\nvery sensitive, artistic and a &quot;typical&quot; middle child.  Up until <br/>\nlast year she was always a so-called average student in school.  <br/>\nWell, last year brought many failed classes.  I did everything I <br/>\nknew how to encourage &quot;showing up&quot; for her classes.  She was there <br/>\nphysically, but didn&#39;t do the work.  It seemed nothing interested <br/>\nher, and she just didn&#39;t participate in the academics.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, here it is a new year, 10th grade for her, and we are <br/>\non &quot;instant replay&quot;.  She is failing most of her classes, and will <br/>\nlikely not graduate with her class.  Pat, being school minded, is <br/>\nworried.  Honestly, I am worried as well.  Part of me wonders why <br/>\nshe is okay with failing and does nothing to try to succeed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are aspects of unschooling that I am still growing into.  I <br/>\nwish I was stronger and more grounded in my beliefs and <br/>\nunderstanding of this area of my life.  So, in spite of this fact, <br/>\nI&#39;ve decided to back off on the education aspect, and Pat is in <br/>\nagreement with me to this point.  Honestly, he doesn&#39;t really know <br/>\nanything much about unschooling.  I find it strange that he never <br/>\nreally asks me about Adrians progress and those typical school based <br/>\nquestions we tend to hear.  He gives me my space and trusts my <br/>\njudgement.  I&#39;m not sure that he would be the same when it came to <br/>\nAmie, especially due to her age.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have discussed home schooling in the past but decided against it <br/>\ndue to the &quot;ex&quot; factor.  Especially with us not being married at the <br/>\ntime, we just didn&#39;t want to wade into those waters.  Plus, I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow how easy it would be for me to influence an unschooling <br/>\nlifestyle on a man that is so school minded.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an unschooler at heart and a mom trying her best to provide an <br/>\nunschooling way of life I find this situation confusing.  Some of <br/>\nthe points I ponder are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Should she quit school?<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  How do I provide an opportunity for her that her father, and she <br/>\nfor that matter, doesn&#39;t understand?<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  How do I create an atmosphere in relation to an unschooling <br/>\nlifestyle for a child in public school?<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  In what way and what points should I try to expose my husband <br/>\nand daughter to unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  What are the characteristics of a child that would effectively <br/>\ndrop out of public school to pursue their own interests?  <br/>\n<br/>\n6.  Could Amie handle this transition?<br/>\n<br/>\n7.  Could we handle this transition?<br/>\n<br/>\n8.  What expecations would we have as parents from a child in such a <br/>\nsituation?<br/>\n<br/>\n9.  How could we effectively discuss this as a family?<br/>\n<br/>\n10.  What alternatives are there in this situation aside from <br/>\nchanging schools and/or coming home?<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t misunderstand me.  These are not point blank questions for <br/>\nanyone to answer.  They are merely a &quot;bird&#39;s eye view&quot; of the <br/>\nconfusion going on inside my head.  Has anyone here ever been <br/>\nthere/done that?  Even if you haven&#39;t, what do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks - Tina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7929,"nextTopicId":7863}}
