There&#39;s really no reason (outside of <br/>\nschool) for a 5 yr old to be reading to himself silently (which is <br/>\nwhat school pushes). Let me ask you: did this nagging feeling start <br/>\nbefore he turned 5 (like 9 months ago for instance) or only since he <br/>\nturned &quot;school age&quot;? For that matter, do you know what &#39;school age&#39; <br/>\nis where you live? In some states, compulsory attendance doesn&#39;t <br/>\nstart until age 6 or 7 or 8. By all means have fun stuff around to <br/>\nplay with and explore - with NO strings attached. If you see some <br/>\nneat colorful 50% off magnetic shape sets that include letters and <br/>\nnumbers, don&#39;t avoid them - grab them, if it looks fun, and set them <br/>\nout on the fridge (or on a metal baking sheet or wherever) and leave <br/>\nit. Letter magnets actually can make some cool looking aliens and <br/>\nsuch without ever being &quot;letters&quot;, they&#39;re just cool shapes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will all come when he is ready - whether it&#39;s now, in 6 months, <br/>\nin a year or two or whatever. Maybe, if he&#39;s willing, be his <br/>\nstenographer and transcribe his imaginative stories onto paper and <br/>\ntype them up for him and read them aloud to him whenever he wants. <br/>\nRight now, my 8 yr old and I are making a comic book. I acted as <br/>\nstenographer to write out the plotline for him since he can&#39;t write <br/>\nfast enough to keep up with his thoughts (he&#39;s not yet a fast enough <br/>\nkeyboardist either, though that is coming along too). Then he&#39;s <br/>\ndrawing the characters and I&#39;m his &#39;colorist&#39; so he can get on with <br/>\nthe action and all and I just color each character as he has <br/>\ndetermined (so-and-so wears a green shirt and blue pants, <br/>\nthe &#39;damsel in distress&#39; wears a pink skirt and has blonde hair, and <br/>\nso on). Certainly let him play with finger paints or playdough (at <br/>\nthe Northeast Unschooling conference there was a playdough funshop <br/>\nwith home made playdoughs using unsweetened koolaid as the color - <br/>\nand it makes them scented too! The color doesn&#39;t cause as much mess <br/>\nas using food coloring either). Make soft pretzels to go with soup <br/>\non a cool rainy day perhaps (really easy to do, recipes abound <br/>\nonline). All sorts of things to do for FUN. Maybe to help you adjust <br/>\nthe way you think about it, consider reading et al as &quot;tools&quot; for <br/>\nhis toolkit, skills that get him to a goal (reading a story he made <br/>\nup or writing his name on a piece of artwork or whatever) rather <br/>\nthan ends in themselves (as they are in school). Do you go down and <br/>\npick out a hammer and hammer in a couple dozen nails each day &quot;just <br/>\nin case&quot; you ever need to nail something together? Not likely <br/>\n(unless you really just like pounding the heck out of them - <br/>\nsometimes that&#39;s really good stress relief BTW). Rather, it is a <br/>\nskill you work on when you have a need to do some carpentry work. <br/>\nReading is the same - a skill that helps with certain types of <br/>\ntasks. Some homeschoolers think &quot;We can bake cookies to learn <br/>\nfractions and measurement in a fun way&quot; Unschoolers think &quot;Hey <br/>\ncookies taste really good!&quot; (and the learning is a side effect).<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164087568,"authorName":"Sasha Sandenskog","from":"&quot;Sasha Sandenskog&quot; &lt;sasha@...&gt;","profile":"sasha_parkin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] support!","postDate":"1155669877","msgId":16505,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjMwMWM2YzBhMCQ3MzdkYzM0MCQ2NTAxYThjMEBTYW5kZW5za29nPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVic21odis1bzI4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16504,"nextInTopic":16509,"prevInTime":16504,"nextInTime":16506,"topicId":16493,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for your support - exactly what I needed!

So lately I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about what five <br/>\nyear olds do with their time (I&#39;ve had several, and Sam is five right <br/>\nnow). As well, since three of my kids have gone through public school <br/>\nkindergarten, I&#39;ve been trying to recall what it is exactly that they <br/>\ndo with that two hours a day, and wondering how someone could <br/>\npossibly plan a curriculum for kindergarten. I&#39;m not saying you are, <br/>\nbut I am saying that many people that I&#39;ve spoken with lately are.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I remember the older kids doing in kindergarten:<br/>\n-circle time, in which they would go around the circle and greet each <br/>\nother, state the day of the week, and answer a question that the <br/>\nteacher presents (what&#39;s your favorite color, book, etc)<br/>\n-journal time, in which they would draw or write whatever they wanted <br/>\nin a spiral notebook<br/>\n-play time, in which they would play with whatever toys were in the <br/>\nroom (and I know that Bre and Emily&#39;s teacher, had center&#39;s. They <br/>\nwere assigned, so the children were told WHICH toys they could play <br/>\nwith and when. This was to &#39;encourage&#39; them to play with toys that <br/>\nthey normally wouldn&#39;t. Her specific concern was that many children <br/>\nnever opted for pretend play, which was important for development for <br/>\nsome reason.)<br/>\n-craft time, in which they would follow the directions of the teacher <br/>\nto cut, paste, color whatever paper the teacher had chosen<br/>\n-potty time, in which they would practice lining up and walking down <br/>\nthe halls to the bathroom, followed by<br/>\n-fountain time, in which they would line up to get a drink and <br/>\npractice their &quot;1,2,3&quot; drink technique (to make it fair)<br/>\n-recess time, in which you had twenty minutes to inflict what damage <br/>\nyou could on whomever would not share that blue crayon ;-)<br/>\n-listening time, in which the teacher would read a book<br/>\n-free play, in which they could choose the area they wanted to play in.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of each time was spent trying to get kids to comply. It&#39;s really <br/>\nquite laughable, actually, because they all know what they want to be <br/>\ndoing, which is precisely what they *should* be doing in terms of <br/>\ndevelopment. Urging them to do something else is really quite counter <br/>\nto their brains. Anyway, like Rue (or was it Ren) some &#39;R&#39; lady <br/>\n(heee ;-) heee) was saying, did this come up once he became school <br/>\nage? Is it a concern because you&#39;re worried what other people will <br/>\nsay? I don&#39;t doubt your concerns at all, was just wondering if there <br/>\nwas some external pressure coming up from somewhere for him to perform?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first three might not be the best examples because they were in <br/>\nPS, but they sound very similar to your son. Rachel was the first not <br/>\nto go to kindie, but she was in preK, almost identical to kindie only <br/>\na little more compassionate about not conforming :-) She&#39;s always <br/>\nbeen quite dexterous, but on the reading, she was the one who told me <br/>\nquite angrily that &#39;You can&#39;t make me learn to read&#39;. In my mind I <br/>\nwas just helping her sound out words, but she very much resented the <br/>\nimplication that she should be learning. At six and a half now, she&#39;s <br/>\npicking up some of her favorite books and reading through them. Sam <br/>\nis sounding out words, has very little fine motor control because he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really care to! He has great gross motor control, he runs, <br/>\nkicks, balances etc. That&#39;s who he is, what he wants to be doing, <br/>\nwhereas Rachel is one to cuddle up for hours, experimenting with <br/>\nlines and pencils and markers.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than thinking of what you can provide to encourage those <br/>\nperceived weaknesses, just think about what your son would enjoy <br/>\ndoing. Does he like fingerpainting? What about playdo or cutting and <br/>\npasting? If he doesn&#39;t like puzzles, he&#39;s not ready for them. You <br/>\ncould try to find puzzles in topics he likes. Sam doesn&#39;t like <br/>\npuzzles except his four pack of dinosaur wooden puzzles. I didn&#39;t get <br/>\nthose for him to help him learn to sit or do fine motor, I bought <br/>\nthem because he loves all things dinosaurs. Empowering them and <br/>\nallowing them to help around is to me the ideal way to help them. If <br/>\nhe likes role playing, make costumes for him. Have him help. He can <br/>\ndraw designs, or cut out stuff from catalogs or magazines that he <br/>\nlikes. He can help draw the pattern onto fabric. He can cut and sew <br/>\nthat with some help. (if you don&#39;t know how to sew, just experiment, <br/>\nlet him see you learning!)

There&#39;s really no reason (outside of <br/>\nschool) for a 5 yr old to be reading to himself silently (which is <br/>\nwhat school pushes). Let me ask you: did this nagging feeling start <br/>\nbefore he turned 5 (like 9 months ago for instance) or only since he <br/>\nturned &quot;school age&quot;? For that matter, do you know what &#39;school age&#39; <br/>\nis where you live? In some states, compulsory attendance doesn&#39;t <br/>\nstart until age 6 or 7 or 8. By all means have fun stuff around to <br/>\nplay with and explore - with NO strings attached. If you see some <br/>\nneat colorful 50% off magnetic shape sets that include letters and <br/>\nnumbers, don&#39;t avoid them - grab them, if it looks fun, and set them <br/>\nout on the fridge (or on a metal baking sheet or wherever) and leave <br/>\nit. Letter magnets actually can make some cool looking aliens and <br/>\nsuch without ever being &quot;letters&quot;, they&#39;re just cool shapes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will all come when he is ready - whether it&#39;s now, in 6 months, <br/>\nin a year or two or whatever. Maybe, if he&#39;s willing, be his <br/>\nstenographer and transcribe his imaginative stories onto paper and <br/>\ntype them up for him and read them aloud to him whenever he wants. <br/>\nRight now, my 8 yr old and I are making a comic book. I acted as <br/>\nstenographer to write out the plotline for him since he can&#39;t write <br/>\nfast enough to keep up with his thoughts (he&#39;s not yet a fast enough <br/>\nkeyboardist either, though that is coming along too). Then he&#39;s <br/>\ndrawing the characters and I&#39;m his &#39;colorist&#39; so he can get on with <br/>\nthe action and all and I just color each character as he has <br/>\ndetermined (so-and-so wears a green shirt and blue pants, <br/>\nthe &#39;damsel in distress&#39; wears a pink skirt and has blonde hair, and <br/>\nso on). Certainly let him play with finger paints or playdough (at <br/>\nthe Northeast Unschooling conference there was a playdough funshop <br/>\nwith home made playdoughs using unsweetened koolaid as the color - <br/>\nand it makes them scented too! The color doesn&#39;t cause as much mess <br/>\nas using food coloring either). Make soft pretzels to go with soup <br/>\non a cool rainy day perhaps (really easy to do, recipes abound <br/>\nonline). All sorts of things to do for FUN. Maybe to help you adjust <br/>\nthe way you think about it, consider reading et al as &quot;tools&quot; for <br/>\nhis toolkit, skills that get him to a goal (reading a story he made <br/>\nup or writing his name on a piece of artwork or whatever) rather <br/>\nthan ends in themselves (as they are in school). Do you go down and <br/>\npick out a hammer and hammer in a couple dozen nails each day &quot;just <br/>\nin case&quot; you ever need to nail something together? Not likely <br/>\n(unless you really just like pounding the heck out of them - <br/>\nsometimes that&#39;s really good stress relief BTW). Rather, it is a <br/>\nskill you work on when you have a need to do some carpentry work. <br/>\nReading is the same - a skill that helps with certain types of <br/>\ntasks. Some homeschoolers think &quot;We can bake cookies to learn <br/>\nfractions and measurement in a fun way&quot; Unschoolers think &quot;Hey <br/>\ncookies taste really good!&quot; (and the learning is a side effect).<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle/Melbrigða","from":"&quot;=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Michelle/Melbrig=F0a?=&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] support!","postDate":"1155651369","msgId":16494,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA4MTUwNzE2eTNkZTVlY2Yyazg2NzdjM2MwMWE1NTUzYzNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVicmw1dis1bzl0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVicmw1dis1bzl0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16493,"nextInTopic":16495,"prevInTime":16493,"nextInTime":16495,"topicId":16493,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Reading is more than sounding<br/>\nout letters to make words.  I would bet that many of those children<br/>\nare trained monkeys who have been taught a system of phonics (which<br/>\nIMO has little to do with reading) but their true comprehension of<br/>\nwhat they are &quot;reading&quot; is very minimal or is post-reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, enjoy your children where they are.

After reading<br/>\nquite a few books re.homeschooling, we have felt ourselves drawn to<br/>\nunschooling.

He has very little interest in learning to read and write<br/>\nor drawing, and finds holding a pen difficult. My gut reaction is just<br/>\nto continue reading to him (which we do on a daily basis and he<br/>\nloves), and possibly to encourage his motor skills through finger<br/>\npainting, etc, and then to basically let him continue with his<br/>\nrole-playing (and anything else)as much as he likes.<br/>\nAll you veteran unschoolers - will he eventually learn to read & write<br/>\nin this way, am I doing the right thing?
