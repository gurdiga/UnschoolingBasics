As I have only been trying<br/>\nunschooling since March, I was very unsure if I understood the concept<br/>\nabout dealing with my 4 year old.  You helped me realize that I am.<br/>\nAnd restored some confidence in myself. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying my best daily to meet her needs, and not ask her to<br/>\n&quot;finish dinner before dessert&quot;  or &quot;pick up her toys, now&quot; and things<br/>\nof that nature.  I guess, perhaps because we are changing our styles,<br/>\nshe is just learning to adjust.  But from your responses, I see that<br/>\nshe will adjust and that I am doing it &quot;right&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPam, I especially like what you said about verbalizing what I am<br/>\nthinking when I act.  I think that this will truly help her understand<br/>\nthat it is natural for everyone to care about others.  Not something<br/>\nthat I am only asking her to do.  I have passed that info on to<br/>\nother&#39;s in my household, so hopefully if we all do it, it will sink in<br/>\nthat she does not have to fight for what she wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33203,"nextTopicId":33718}}
