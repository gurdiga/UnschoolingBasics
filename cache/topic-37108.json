I&#39;m a founding member of the board of the National Home  <br/>\nEducation Network and a former board member of the HomeSchool  <br/>\nAssociation of California.  I&#39;ve worked with homeschool attorneys and  <br/>\nbeen involved with a number of legal cases. I&#39;ve followed homeschool  <br/>\nlaw for many years, read and discussed the laws in every single state,  <br/>\nworked with groups in quite a few different states. I&#39;ve had lengthy  <br/>\ndiscussions directly with an HSLDA attorney in the past and I once  <br/>\ndebated an HSLDA attorney and their head researcher at the annual  <br/>\nmeetings of the American Education Association.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m doubtful that HSDLA is recommending that people obey laws of  <br/>\nstates in which they do not any longer reside. I&#39;d like to see that  <br/>\nrecommendation in writing. But, I have to say that it is true that,  <br/>\nhistorically, HSLDA has been known to advise their clients to over- <br/>\ncomply with laws - to provide more than the law legally requires and I  <br/>\nwould never just take their advice without researching for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a random personal opinion. If you don&#39;t LIVE in a state,  <br/>\nthat state has no jurisdiction over your children. If I move to Japan  <br/>\nor France or Mexico or any other country, the state of California,  <br/>\nwhere I currently reside, cannot follow me to that foreign country and  <br/>\ncompel me to follow their state education code.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yes, they CAN compel me to pay taxes but only on income earned in  <br/>\nthat state and on property owned in that state.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent some time searching HSLDA&#39;s site to see if they actually were  <br/>\nrecommending people follow a state law when they don&#39;t live in the  <br/>\nstate. Could not find it. I did find this, though, which is part of  <br/>\ntheir recommendations to military families who reside in Germany  <br/>\n(where homeschooling is currently illegal):<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Mandatory school attendance laws are creations of state legislatures.  <br/>\nSuch laws are common throughout the United States and Germany. The  <br/>\nchildren of US military and DoD civilian personnel assigned to  <br/>\nGermany, however, are not subject to state mandatory attendance  <br/>\nstatutes of the US because the children do not reside in any of the  <br/>\nfifty states.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey go on to say that children of military or civilian DoD families  <br/>\nare not subject to the mandatory attendance laws of the country  <br/>\nthey&#39;re living in because of formal &quot;status of forces&quot; agreements, but  <br/>\nthat the children of other US citizens residing in other countries may  <br/>\nbe subject to the laws of that country.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is not a citizen of this country.

Once you&#39;ve moved out of the state, they have no more  <br/>\njurisdiction over you (and it doesn&#39;t matter if you still own a house  <br/>\nthere, if your kids don&#39;t live in that state then you don&#39;t have to  <br/>\nfollow that state&#39;s education code).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no &quot;national&quot; education law. If your kids don&#39;t live in the  <br/>\nUnited States, they are not subject to the laws of any U.S. state. The  <br/>\ncountry you ARE living in may consider you visitors and not require  <br/>\nyou to obey their laws either. In that case - lucky you - you&#39;re  <br/>\nindependent. If someone from another country comes to the United  <br/>\nStates to live (not just for vacation), they legally are supposed to  <br/>\nfollow the education laws of the state in which they live.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 28, 2008, at 7:22 AM, cecegary wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; According to HSLDA (Homeschool Legal Defense Association).
