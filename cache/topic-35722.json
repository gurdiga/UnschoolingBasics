I believe we all have neeeds, some of us handle it better, so <br/>\ndon&#39;t. I always explained or inform beforehand of my son&#39;s <br/>\nquirkiness/ needs. And because of my son, I am always aware and <br/>\nunderstand and accept the reason why certain people act the way they <br/>\ndo, very differently to ours. For I believe there is always 2 sides <br/>\nto a story. <br/>\n<br/>\nLike your kid, my 8 yrs old son can have very good imagination. He <br/>\ncan go on blabbling away scripts from movies, and fall into a role <br/>\nquite convincingly. It&#39;s called Creative Imagination, and it&#39;s <br/>\nhealthy for a child. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think perhaps your friend is having issues of in-ability to <br/>\ndifferentiate between a real cry of help or play-acting, an <br/>\nuncomfortable feeling of losing a sense of control? She already said <br/>\nit stresses her out. If we were to put your enthusiatic son in a <br/>\ncostume and on a stage, she won&#39;t be seeing it as crying wolf, <br/>\ninstead she&#39;ll quite happily and safely accept it as stage-play. <br/>\n<br/>\nOption 1 - express your opinion. I do this if I feel I don&#39;t really <br/>\nneed that person&#39;s friendship that badly enough, because for me, in <br/>\nall friendship, it&#39;s about give and take, and if I feel so and so is <br/>\nnot willing to make some compromisation, then I don&#39;t need sucha <br/>\nfriend. It will be too painful and detrimental to try to maintain a <br/>\nlop-sided relationship. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can tell her that in your OPINION, the issue is more with her <br/>\nnerves (LOL) rather than your son. Acknowledge that she is effected <br/>\nby your son&#39;s enthusiatic play-acting, but because it is your house <br/>\nand your rules and you know enough to understand the concept of <br/>\ncrying wolf, and this, to your OPINION, is most definetely not. <br/>\nExplained that she&#39;s hurting your feelings and your son&#39;s, by <br/>\nchallenging your assessment of the situation for surely you know <br/>\nyour son best, and by imposing HER limitation onto you guys, &quot;it is <br/>\nrather like teaching you how to parent your son?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe downfall of this is she might refuse to accept your opinion of <br/>\nthis scenario (for nobody likes to be told they&#39;re wrong but she <br/>\nhas, in not many words, told you you&#39;re wrong to allow this!), and <br/>\nwill huff-of and not come back with her children. Or she might <br/>\nsurprised you and see the other side of her actions and learn to <br/>\ntrust you, and back-off. That&#39;s the word, &quot;Trust&quot;. Why does she not <br/>\ntrust you when you&#39;re in your home and you said it&#39;s ok and <br/>\neverything is fine?  <br/>\n<br/>\nOr.....<br/>\n<br/>\nOption 2. If she&#39;s worth keeping, then You compromise.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can talk to your son about acceoting HER needs and limitation, <br/>\nif he wants to play with her kids. Hopefully he&#39;ll understand that <br/>\nhis acting is &quot;just too good&quot; (and someday he&#39;ll make a fine actor,) <br/>\nand it sounds so convincing that everytime he cries for help, She <br/>\nDOES think he is in danger and in pain, and this causes her un-<br/>\nnessecary worries that she can&#39;t even enjoy her cup of tea. She is <br/>\nafterall the guest. But if he says NO, he&#39;s not willing to <br/>\ncompromise, then I guessed you already have your answer - her kids <br/>\nwere obviously not that important enough for him to sacrifice his <br/>\nplay-acting.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI have took this route before many times, and it&#39;s help my son learn <br/>\nto understand the side of the story,  and he&#39;s learn to accomodate <br/>\nother people&#39;s needs, for I cannot constantly go round and force <br/>\nother people adapt to my son&#39;s needs. Not everyone is so <br/>\naccomodating, and the last thing I want is for my son to think <br/>\nhe&#39;s &quot;done something wrong&quot; again just because some poeple is so <br/>\nfixated with thier version of parenting! By talking to my son, he <br/>\nhas an opportunity to weigh the pros and cons of any social <br/>\nsituation and is in control of the decision whether to take the <br/>\nrelationship forward or not. Sometimes he&#39;s very sure of Not, but <br/>\nothertimes, he&#39;ll say &quot;let&#39;s give it a try and see what happens&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for those baby talks. You&#39;re kid&#39;s only 5, what does this other <br/>\nlady expect? A presentation?!!? My kid&#39;s 8 already, and he STILL <br/>\nbaby talks with me. It&#39;s called bonding, and me and my son&#39;s bond is <br/>\nvery STRONG! <br/>\n<br/>\nJamie, be confident about your child&#39;s differences and innocence.<br/>\nLearn to di-resgard what other people remark or say- &quot;one ear in, <br/>\none ear out&quot; as the saying goes. It&#39;s just a negative reflection of <br/>\nthier &quot;flawed and trained mind&quot;, of which, when reflected onto us, <br/>\nit shows how far down the positive route we are on by unschooling <br/>\nour kids. Everytime someone makes a negative remark to you, be <br/>\ngrateful and thankful that you are free from such negative thoughts, <br/>\nfree from such constraints and pains of rules following, and is <br/>\nliving your lives as freely as you want it to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOr....<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may want to fight back such &quot;barb&quot; by offer your OPINION!! Go <br/>\non, the next time that lady make the baby talk remark again, just <br/>\ncasually remark that that you enjoy your son&#39;s baby talks and you&#39;re <br/>\nfine with it. But out of curiosity, ask her what makes she thinks <br/>\nit&#39;s un-acceptable for a 5 yrs old to be baby-talking? Infact, how <br/>\nshould he be talking? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you keep an open mind, you will find it&#39;s because they <br/>\nremembered being told off for not &quot;talking &quot; properly when they are <br/>\nyoung! What a sad thing isn&#39;t it? That these people never really had <br/>\nparents like us, who respect our kids for what they are and <br/>\ncelebrate them for who they are. You have to symphatise with them, <br/>\nfor we too, understood that pain of growing up with loads of un-<br/>\nneccessary pressure of un-met expectations placed on us to. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re the lucky ones, for we seeked, and found our way out!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n HUgs,<br/>\nSharonBugs. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;freeedomm&quot; <br/>\n&lt;insanity09@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi I am Jamie, I have been lurking since spring.

After trying to keep the communication lines<br/>\nopen between me and Karl about it for a long time (something like 3 years<br/>\nand for most of that time it wasn&#39;t that bad), it finally went too far.  By<br/>\nthen it was very hard on Karl either way... continuing to play with the kids<br/>\nwho seemed to be getting meaner and meaner every visit who he had kinda<br/>\ngrown to like (who seemed more and more frequently unable to show  they like<br/>\nhim) or not having them as a play option.  I want to think there&#39;s some<br/>\nother way to deal with over the top stuff but even the adults were over the<br/>\ntop in this regular play situation, and that is what was really making it<br/>\nunworkable.  The good thing is I had the excuse of distance to bow out<br/>\nwith.  So I managed to stay civil and cut ties, with lots of comforting for<br/>\nKarl.  It was not easy because by then he was very accustomed to their crap<br/>\nand at least half believed it was ok that they behaved in extreme ways<br/>\ntoward him (and others).  The other part of it was that me and Brian had<br/>\nbeen separated for about 1 1/2 years of that time period.  So I wasn&#39;t even<br/>\nin the same state until these last 4 months.  Not an easy thing to come home<br/>\nto deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian was very helpful and so was Kelly Lovejoy in encouraging me<br/>\nto seek out and start other social opportunities for Karl.

Any<br/>\nfolks nearby or willing to drive are welcome to bring their kids.)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9/5/08, freeedomm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:insanity09@...\">insanity09@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hi I am Jamie, I have been lurking since spring.

These situations upset my son. He loves <br/>\nto play with the other children. I have not been able to find like <br/>\nminded people where we live. I do not want my son to feel social <br/>\npressure to fit their little boxes as to how little children should <br/>\nbehave.~~<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m sure these situations do upset your son!  It sounds like they&#39;re upsetting you too.  Do you actually get any enjoyment out of these visits/playdates?  The cost sounds high to me.  I would venture that no playdates would feel better than ones like this!!!  It is a challenge finding like-minded people sometimes.  I&#39;ve heard it said that you know you&#39;re a radical unschooler when your closest friend lives 100 miles away :).  But I see it as my job to be the intermediary between my children and people that don&#39;t have 100% respect for them...like my in-laws, which is why we don&#39;t visit very often at all, and why we had lots of &#39;words&#39; during our last visit.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~How do you stop people from going there with your child? I wish these <br/>\nwere the only two incidents but they are not!~~<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s your choice really.  You can be direct and perhaps lose friends, or you can be indirect and not invite them over.  Is this really the kind of company you want to keep??<br/>\n <br/>\nJodi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Dealing with &quot;other&quot; parents","postDate":"1220662839","msgId":35725,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwOTA1MTgwMHExNDA2ZTVjY2w2ZDJjNmVlOGNmYTZjOGI2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc5cnNxNis3ZDEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc5cnNxNis3ZDEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35722,"nextInTopic":35726,"prevInTime":35724,"nextInTime":35726,"topicId":35722,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I quietly stop inviting such people into my home if at all possible. ~Katherine ...
