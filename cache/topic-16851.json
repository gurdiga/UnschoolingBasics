Thank you so <br/>\nmuch for helping me sort through things and get to the heart of the <br/>\nmatter!  All of what was posted, whether I agree or not, has given <br/>\nme so much food for thought.  That, plus a very good discussion with <br/>\nDH this morning, and I&#39;m in a much better &quot;head screwed on right&quot; <br/>\nsort of place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really appreciate your time and honesty.  I do believe that we can <br/>\ncontinue moving toward unschooling in our whole lives even though we <br/>\ndidn&#39;t start out that way -- although I think it must be easier if a <br/>\nfamily doesn&#39;t have to overcome damage from a control-paradigm.  I <br/>\ntotally see that I was focusing on the negative -- precisely what <br/>\nwas bugging me about DD-8yrs.  (Freaking ice cream cone for on top <br/>\nof the bowl!  Argh!  I wish I hadn&#39;t gotten so wrapped up and could <br/>\nhave seen that simple solution!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote our summer had been excruciating -- but you know what???  A <br/>\nfew moments, a handful, maybe two handfuls really are all that were <br/>\nexcruciating (probably only because I made them that way!) and they <br/>\nwere in the context of an incredibly fun and adventurous summer -- <br/>\nwe did some way cool things and had tons of fun and togetherness!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we&#39;ve talked (DH is supportive of unschooling, he&#39;s just got <br/>\nmore authoritarian baggage to unpack than I do -- I&#39;ve got plenty of <br/>\nother sorts of baggage though, lol) and we too are parenting in the <br/>\ngap (love that!) but are committed to making this work.<br/>\n<br/>\nDH actually asked me a very interesting question: &quot;Are you using <br/>\nunschooling to control things?&quot;  And we spent some time on the idea <br/>\nof &quot;if I get it right all will be peaceful and pleasant and perfect <br/>\nand happy all the time&quot; being a pipe dream and what is more <br/>\nrealistic.
