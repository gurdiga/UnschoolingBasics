In a hospital or<br/>\nat home. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a woman gives birth at home and something goes wrong, it&#39;s<br/>\nassumed the midwife is at fault nowadays. &quot;Serious malpractice.&quot; If<br/>\nsomething goes wrong with a hospital birth, from what I&#39;ve seen and<br/>\nheard, there&#39;s a whole lot of blame put on the mother: oh, your uterus<br/>\nwas unripe, your hips are too small, you wouldn&#39;t contracting fast<br/>\nenough, or whatever. There doesn&#39;t seem to be the automatic &quot;man, that<br/>\ndoctor eff&#39;ed up&quot; response. Where&#39;s the automatic malpractice label?  <br/>\n<br/>\nEither way a woman loses when there&#39;s a difficult or tragic birth<br/>\nexperience. People don&#39;t automatically talk about malpractice in<br/>\nhospital births as much as they jump to that when talking about<br/>\nhomebirths. As if home births are inherently more dangerous than<br/>\nhospital births. As if there is a band of renegade midwives out there<br/>\nlooking to be cavalier and reckless with birthing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in Karen&#39;s post with the lady turning in the midwife! because the<br/>\nbirth didn&#39;t go as she wanted it to go *really* bugs me because would<br/>\nthat woman have taken the doctor to court for malpractice if the birth<br/>\ndidn&#39;t go the way she wanted in the hospital? Probably not. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s late. I need to go to sleep.
