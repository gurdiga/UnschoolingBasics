I&#39;d have to ask DH and DS about them.<br/>\nOh, yeah, some are more &quot;building&quot; oriented rather than the running<br/>\naround type &quot;obbys&quot; and such (an &quot;obby&quot; for non-Robloxians, is an<br/>\nobstacle course). Those might be somewhat doable - I&#39;ve been able to<br/>\nwatch them for short times, as long as there&#39;s not a lot of people in<br/>\nthat one game. I&#39;ll see if DH or DS have any good &#39;places&#39; that they&#39;ve<br/>\nbuilt that aren&#39;t too motion-busy. Maybe that would be a good project<br/>\nfor DH - he&#39;s getting into the guts and programming stuff from scratch.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
