I am 38 and will be married to dh for 19 years \nthis july.&nbsp; We have one dd who is graduating in a week and 1/2 from public \nschools. I homeschool my two boys 14 and 9.&nbsp; We brought the oldest home \nduring his 6th grade year and this is the 9yr olds first year home schooling (at \nhis request but was planning on bringing him home this next year but he wanted \nit sooner). I have aways been interested in unschooling and dh is very for it \n(what we think in our heads is unschooling) but we still have a bit of \ndeschooling to do ourselves.&nbsp; I still find myself saying I need to get this \nmath book or this spelling book or history book. Then of course there were days \nthat I felt bad that I was failing them when I was either too busy to get \nlessons together ect and i felt I was&nbsp; bad mom and teacher for them because \nthey did not do &quot;enough&quot; schooling for the day. Since day one of bringing home \nthe oldest and after reading many books, I formed the opinnion that there were \nmany things that the &quot;schooled children&quot; were being forced to learn and of that \nstuff what did we remember today. And when and if we, &nbsp;today, &nbsp;want to \nknow something we research it, whether it is from library sources or the \ninternet or calling those who are experts in that particular field. I believe if \nI teach my children how to find those resources that they will do fine in the \nfuture with anything they do in thier lives, but then I am back at beating \nmyself up again that they need to use a math book lol Like I said &quot;I&quot; have to \ndeschool myself. </font></strong></div>\n<div><strong><font face=\"Andy\" color=\"#ff00ff\" size=\"4\">&nbsp; I am here hoping you \nall will be able to guide me with your wisdom and experiences of your \nunschooing&nbsp;experiences so that I will be able to let&nbsp;go and be one of \nyou. </font></strong></div>\n<div><strong><font face=\"Andy\" color=\"#ff00ff\" size=\"4\">&nbsp;Debbie \n</font></strong>&nbsp;</div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":123,"nextTopicId":94}}
