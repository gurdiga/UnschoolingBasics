We&#39;ve been to private school, public school, home <br/>\nschool and presently we are doing charter school.  I truly enjoyed the <br/>\nfreedom of homeschool, but feared perhaps I wasn&#39;t doing enough.  So we <br/>\nswitched to charter school and none of us are very happy about the <br/>\nsheer volumn of work.  To me it seems like a lot of it is wasted time <br/>\non information they don&#39;t need at this time and won&#39;t remember later on <br/>\nwhen they may actually use it. I would love to hear how you came to <br/>\nunschooling and what your experience has been.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28019,"nextTopicId":28030}}
