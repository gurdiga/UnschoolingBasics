Think about when you&#39;ve made  a mistake and  <br/>\nsomeone made the assumption you did it deliberately. How did you  <br/>\nfeel? Doesn&#39;t it make you angry? And then the focus moves from  <br/>\nfinding better ways to solve something to defending yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am still not sure not taking any<br/>\n&gt; action is the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No one has ever said don&#39;t take action. The actions people here will  <br/>\nhelp others away from are anger and punishment and actions that  <br/>\ninterfere with relationship building.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child needs something, they need help getting it, not anger that  <br/>\nthey&#39;re doing it wrong. They need reminding that hitting isn&#39;t  <br/>\nacceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I could not have prevented it!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some situations can be averted by being aware of tension building up  <br/>\nand calling one child away or finding something new to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut sometimes the actions come out of no where. The goal isn&#39;t to  <br/>\nstop kids from hitting -- that will happen as a side effect -- but to  <br/>\nhelp them find ways that are better, that aren&#39;t hurtful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; BUt what to do ...WHEN it happens is more my question here. Doing<br/>\n&gt; nothing..or just suggesting over and over until you are blue in the<br/>\n&gt; face...not respectful..how would you feel if...this does not seem to<br/>\n&gt; work long term.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s happening over and over, she&#39;s too young to control her  <br/>\nimpulses. You can&#39;t teach her skills she&#39;s not ready to handle any  <br/>\nmore than you can teach a 6 mo to walk. It will happen with time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the mean time, be aware of their tension level. Keep them out of  <br/>\nreach of each other. Arrange breaks with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also sounds like she&#39;s jealous. She was the baby in the family and  <br/>\nsuddenly she&#39;s been displaced by something that the parents find  <br/>\nnewer and better. It&#39;s like a death has occurred in her life and  <br/>\neveryone expects her to be happy about it and be nice to what has  <br/>\ndisplaced her.<br/>\n<br/>\nA really good book is Siblings Without Rivalry. It&#39;s a very easy read.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil you can get inside her head and understand the total upheaval  <br/>\nyou&#39;ve imposed on her life and see what it looks like and feels like  <br/>\nfrom inside her, you&#39;re going to have a hard time responding in ways  <br/>\nthat make sense to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe traditional way is to *make* them think right. They *need* to get  <br/>\nover the feeling the baby&#39;s an interloper and start to like it. Which  <br/>\ncauses huge breakdowns in relationships and only makes the behavior  <br/>\nworse.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you feel if your husband brought a new wife home? What if  <br/>\nhe got angry that you wouldn&#39;t embrace her with as much happiness as  <br/>\nhe had? Would that make you warmer towards her?<br/>\n<br/>\n From your daughter&#39;s point of view there was no reason you would  <br/>\nbring another child into the house. You had her. Why would you need  <br/>\nanother? And yet you did. And you&#39;ve been upset that she hasn&#39;t  <br/>\nthought it was a great thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat she needs is sympathy and understanding. She needs to feel that  <br/>\nit&#39;s okay to feel displaced.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of it this way: If it were raining and she was upset because  <br/>\nshe wanted to go outside, would it be better to get frustrated with  <br/>\nher upsetness because there was nothing anyone could do about it and  <br/>\nshe&#39;d just better accept it, or to sympathize and talk about what a  <br/>\ngreat time it could have been?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I did read &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; which I liked..but he never<br/>\n&gt; gave much at all in the way of handling certain situations that we<br/>\n&gt; all run accross..so while on paper it sounds great..not sure how<br/>\n&gt; practical it really is.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because  a lot of it is a change in perspective. Seeing the  <br/>\nsituations with new eyes rather than applying solution x to situation  <br/>\ny. It&#39;s being aware of the causes of the behavior and rearranging  <br/>\nwhat and how you do things to bring the tension level down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I mean..how does one<br/>\n&gt; handle it when your child smacks, or kicks a sibling, or rips a toy<br/>\n&gt; from her hand,talks in that snotty tone of voice, etc etc. You can<br/>\n&gt; say it is disrespectful to her..,etc etc..but she could care less.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By reading Siblings Without Rivalry! And Sandra Dodd&#39;s website.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest help you can give her is changing your overall treatment  <br/>\ntowards her. The more you fill her up, the less she&#39;ll feel a need to  <br/>\nsteal what used to be hers from her sister. See her as the displaced  <br/>\nwife who is still pissed after all these years and *help* her find  <br/>\nways to be happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to be aware that these tensions exist and steer the kids  <br/>\naway from situations where the anger builds up. Call her away for  <br/>\nimportant things like to help you make lunch or to put some clothes  <br/>\naway upstairs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, how can someone say that a LIMIT and a contract regarding<br/>\n&gt; it..such as staying up late as long as they are not loud and waking<br/>\n&gt; others is any different to another person who says you can play with<br/>\n&gt; any toys you want, as long as when you are done, you clean up or put<br/>\n&gt; it away??<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because of the way kids view the world. When they&#39;re really young,  <br/>\nthey are less likely to understand being quiet for someone else but  <br/>\nthe more their needs are treated with respect, the more they  <br/>\nreciprocate. When they know others are working hard to help them get  <br/>\nwhat they need, they feel the same towards others. (When they&#39;re old  <br/>\nenough.) When people&#39;s needs are filled to the brim and are  <br/>\noverflowing, there&#39;s no need to be mean and fight with others for  <br/>\nlimited resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now your older daughter feels that attention and love are  <br/>\nlimited resources and she needs to eliminate the rival to get as much  <br/>\nas she needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nArrange to take her out on her own occasionally, just the two of you.  <br/>\nTalk about how hard it is to have a little sister. Talk about the fun  <br/>\nparts too. Everything has a good and bad side! There&#39;s a big  <br/>\ndifference between finding ways to be positive and cope with a bad  <br/>\nsituation, and pretending there&#39;s no bad part and it&#39;s all good.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s where she is right now. She&#39;s seeing all the bad parts and  <br/>\nfrom her point of view you&#39;re saying &quot;La de da, isn&#39;t life grand!  <br/>\n(Except for when you misbehave.)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To me it is the same . We have a smaller home all on one<br/>\n&gt; level and so it is important for us to be able to live/move around<br/>\n&gt; in the home when the toys are picked up and not scattered all over<br/>\n&gt; all day!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s important to *you*. That&#39;s a really really important mental  <br/>\nshift to make that will help you understand what we&#39;re talking about  <br/>\nand help you start building relationships rather than contributing to  <br/>\nthe tension. You will improve your relationship immensely if you can  <br/>\nsee that just because you are certain something is important (and  <br/>\nsensible!) that not everyone is going to feel that way. And the  <br/>\nsooner you accept that it&#39;s important to you and you alone and  <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be imposed on someone else, the less tension there will be  <br/>\naround it and the better your relationship with be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your husband loved football, would it help if he insisted that you  <br/>\nwatch? Would it help if he made you watch until you understood how  <br/>\nimportant football is?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can invite them to help. (And treat it as help a friend might  <br/>\ngive.) You can ask them to do specific tasks. (Could you put the red  <br/>\ntruck in the bin for me?) You can turn things into games. (Others  <br/>\nwill have other suggestions.) All are relationship building and don&#39;t  <br/>\nbuild a negative atmosphere around cleaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot about seeing the world through kids&#39; points of view at  <br/>\nmy website:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160549037,"authorName":"pamela6000","from":"&quot;pamela6000&quot; &lt;pamela6000@...&gt;","profile":"pamela6000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: How to handle tough kids","postDate":"1169927218","msgId":21080,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVwZ2E3aStva2l0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVwOWE0cSs1ZjIyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21078,"nextInTopic":21086,"prevInTime":21079,"nextInTime":21081,"topicId":21022,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"--Thanks for the help and posts.

Ultimately, radical unschooling <br/>\ninvolves a shift in thinking away from the whole &quot;who&#39;s in control&quot; <br/>\nquestion entirely. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way of thinking about this, is: why only two choices? Sure, <br/>\nyou don&#39;t want to bombard a young child with more options than she <br/>\ncan handle, but you also don&#39;t want to limit *yourself* to only a <br/>\ncouple of options. This is going back to the rules-vs-principles <br/>\nidea.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For example: &quot;we take quiet time at 1:00 or 2pm, which<br/>\n&gt; would you prefer?&quot; OR &quot;quiet reading time is going to<br/>\n&gt; be 1 hour or 1.5 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To me, this looks like &quot;lets make a rule&quot; - but what is the *why* <br/>\nbehind these statements? Personally, I&#39;d state the underlying <br/>\npriciple as: Everyone&#39;s Needs are Important. Okay, so if mom needs a <br/>\nbreak what are some other ways mom can get the time she needs <br/>\nwithout setting some rather arbitrary limits? A movie, a bath, or a <br/>\ntrip to the playground could all, potenitally, meet the child&#39;s <br/>\nneeds while still honoring mom&#39;s, without any kind of arbirary <br/>\nlimits being set. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith a younger child, it isn&#39;t necessary to lay those all out as <br/>\npossible choices, either. There&#39;s a certain amount of prediction and <br/>\nunderstanding that comes from knowing our kids - my 5yr old is <br/>\nunlikely to want a bath, for example, so *I* wouldn&#39;t offer one in <br/>\nthe hopes of getting some down time.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90961830,"authorName":"Sheryl Shomler","from":"Sheryl Shomler &lt;sherylshomler@...&gt;","profile":"sherylshomler","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: How to handle younger kids (Long)","postDate":"1169825530","msgId":21057,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzOTc2LjM5MjA2LnFtQHdlYjUyMDA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21053,"nextInTopic":21066,"prevInTime":21056,"nextInTime":21058,"topicId":21022,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Give her two choices that you can live with so that she feels empowered and yet you feel in control.

We have two dds, 5 and 2. I had <br/>\n  my 5yro dd in preschool a bit and saw it squash her creativity and <br/>\n  cause behavior issues. I had to convince my dh..who is not an easy <br/>\n  person to convince and often times tells me to put her in school,but <br/>\n  actually it is working ok. (My parents still cannot understand <br/>\n  why,as they put it,&quot;I would want to do that to MYSELF&quot; and have no <br/>\n  free time, etc.) <br/>\n  The problem is that I do have days..maybe 3 a week, where I feel <br/>\n  like throwing my 5 yro the next school bus that comes down our <br/>\n  street! She was literally an angel until the 2yr old was born. <br/>\n  Since, she is controlling, bossy, tells many &quot;stories&quot;, and many <br/>\n  times just mean to her sister or us. I have tried many approaches <br/>\n  but my patience wears thin and often I resort to yelling(which I <br/>\n  hate) but it seems to be the only thing that gets her attention. I <br/>\n  know she is tired and really still could benefit from a daytime nap<br/>\n  (I know this from the rare days she looks at bookS and falls asleep <br/>\n  for 2 hrs and afterward is so much nicer all day!)But she refused my <br/>\n  suggestions of a nap or even quiet time most days.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If/when, I make suggestions to her, she often uses that <br/>\n  whinny,snotty voice and says or screams her answers. I am really <br/>\n  just confussed about unschooling as a parenting style..but now as an <br/>\n  education style..which I get and really like. It seems people just <br/>\n  change words around like principles for rules.

I usually start by asking <br/>\nmy 5yr old questions if I think she needs my input for some reason. <br/>\nWhen she whines or screams at me I take it as a sign that I haven&#39;t <br/>\nbeen listening or responding to her needs very promptly - with a <br/>\ntoddler underfoot you may have been saying a lot of &quot;hold on...in a <br/>\nminute...not right now...later...I&#39;m in the middle of something...&quot; <br/>\nall that can add up to a huge bill of frustration for a kid. <br/>\n<br/>\nA whole lot of unschooling younger kids has to do with being <br/>\nproactive in making sure they have the tools they need to be <br/>\nautonomous and looking carefully for nonverbal cues. Some kids are <br/>\ngreat at being able to tell you what they want/need and listen to <br/>\nexplanations, but alot aren&#39;t. Mine&#39;s not. She&#39;s waaaaaay better <br/>\nthan she used to be, but she&#39;s still not the most conversational of <br/>\nchildren, so looking for non-verbal cues and patterns is a big part <br/>\nof how I help her get her needs met. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems people just <br/>\n&gt; change words around like principles for rules.

Well, she might be hungry, or <br/>\ntired or feeling out of control or frustrated or.... She doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave the means to asses her own internal state and communicate it in <br/>\na clear way, yet, so part of mom&#39;s job is to be aware of those <br/>\npossibilities and seek to address them *before* it gets to the <br/>\nhitting stage. That&#39;s not about rules at all, its about how to be a <br/>\nbetter mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of that involves being aware of patterns - how long has it been <br/>\nsince she had some protein? how many times has she needed a grown-up <br/>\nto help her, today? how often has she felt &quot;second best&quot; to the <br/>\ntoddler? Some of it involves mom being available in the moment - I <br/>\nmean right there on the floor with the kids, not trying to get the <br/>\ndishes washed and laundry folded while the kids play. If you are <br/>\nright there in the middle of things, you have the chance to see the <br/>\nfrown and ask &quot;can I help&quot; or catch the hand before it hits. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;talks in that snotty tone of voice<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve mentioned this a couple times, so clearly its an issue for <br/>\nyou. I&#39;d suggest you look at a couple different things, here. First <br/>\nof all, what tone of voice do *you* use and what kind of language do <br/>\nyou use with your dd? Sometimes that snotty tone is what We sound <br/>\nlike to Them. Oops. Make a concious effort to listen to yourself, <br/>\nespecially when you are saying something like &quot;Not now&quot;. Also watch <br/>\nout for times when you may be &quot;lecturing&quot; her - I don&#39;t know anyone, <br/>\nkid or grown who likes to be lectured, but so far I&#39;ve never met a <br/>\nparent who doesn&#39;t at least do it occasionally (accidentally - I do <br/>\nit myself). Its also a possible source of &quot;snotty tone&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;cleaning up....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My gosh, there are whole threads on this topic alone! Really, I&#39;d <br/>\nrecommend reading the archives both here and at Always Unschooled:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nwhich is a board with a focus on unschooling with little kids, even <br/>\npre-school and babies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess a short answer is to look for alternatives - ways to <br/>\nsimplify cleanup for you or make it less of an issue overall.<br/>\n<br/>\n The one idea I would pull from your post for you to consider <br/>\nis &quot;when you are done&quot; - children aren&#39;t ever really *done* playing, <br/>\nand often will multitask in their play and have several different <br/>\nthings going on at the same time. My 5yr old will sometimes have a <br/>\nproject of game involving toys that lasts for several days, even <br/>\nthough she will leave it for hours at a time to do other things. <br/>\nAsking kids to clean up on *our* schedule undermines their natural <br/>\nprocess of discovery. If your husband were rebuilding an engine, <br/>\nwould you ask him to put it back in the car before he came in for <br/>\nlunch? He&#39;d probably respond with a pretty darn &quot;snotty tone&quot; if you <br/>\ndid ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160549037,"authorName":"pamela6000","from":"&quot;pamela6000&quot; &lt;pamela6000@...&gt;","profile":"pamela6000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"How to handle tough kids","postDate":"1169697754","msgId":21022,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVwOWE0cSs1ZjIyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21035,"prevInTime":21021,"nextInTime":21023,"topicId":21022,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, We are a new family to unschooling.
