So, I&#39;m not <br/>\ngoing to take a list of  textbooks. After speaking with three different <br/>\npeople who know them well, it  doesn&#39;t seem like it would be needed. A church is <br/>\nlooking at the possibility  of donating a storage container for the family. If <br/>\npeople have household  things such as a sewing machine, yard goods (Nancy makes <br/>\ndresses for the  girls), school supplies, computer, encyclopedia set when <br/>\nthey have space for  it, they can email me offlist at which point I&#39;ll verify the <br/>\nparticular need  is still there. The family is doing well. A few years back <br/>\nthey lost a 10(?)  yr. old son due to the effect of chemo for cancer. They have <br/>\nthe perspective  that this is nothing in comparison to that. <br/>\nI think the new baby is due in  Sept. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain the real need is the building fund. Any donation would be  great. <br/>\nPlease don&#39;t think $10 wouldn&#39;t make an impact. It will as many of us  saw that in <br/>\n2001 when the Farley&#39;s lost their home. Checks or cash can be sent  to Maine <br/>\nSavings Credit Union, 122 Park Street Milo, Maine 04463. Payable to  Metilly <br/>\nFire Fund. You can also make payable to Maine Savings with notations  to the <br/>\nmemo and back &quot;deposit Metilly fund&quot;. Phone number of Maine Savings:  <br/>\n207-943-2134. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a short list of some household needs for the  family that was posted <br/>\nto the Freecycle list. I&#39;m not including it here as I  think the list will be <br/>\nfulfilled.
