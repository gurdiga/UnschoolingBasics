They figure out new stuff all the time.  It&#39;s the way life is supposed to be.  The only kids I know who feel like they don&#39;t want to learn anything are the kids who are schooled and come to equate learning with being taught, thinking the only way to learn is to be taught, so learning must be bad.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  It&#39;s okay if someday your kids figure out that learning is everywhere.  It&#39;s not okay if your methods lead your kids to feel like you&#39;ve been setting up learning opportunities for them -- that says you don&#39;t trust that learning will happen, that you still feel you have to make it happen to them.
