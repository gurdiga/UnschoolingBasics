I had an analog <br/>\nwatch that I haven&#39;t worn in a few years because frankly, I don&#39;t <br/>\ncare what time it is. :-) I offered it to her and she decided it was <br/>\ntime to learn how to tell time with an analog watch. She never saw <br/>\nthe need before because digital clocks/watches are everywhere. She&#39;s <br/>\npretty tight with her money, saving every penny for the next five <br/>\nyears as she&#39;ll be in grad school, so she doesn&#39;t want to go out and <br/>\nbuy a new digital watch.
