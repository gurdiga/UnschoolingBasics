Her book and the classes helped me identify a lot <br/>\nof my automatic scripts I was playing in my head regarding my <br/>\ninteractions with ds. My exposure to the information really came at an <br/>\nopportune time for me to really delve into how my childhood was <br/>\naffecting me and my relationship withds. It brought up a LOT of grief. <br/>\nDuring one of the workshops, Pam has everyone bring a picture of <br/>\nthemselves at a young age. She then plays the song, &quot;How Could Anyone?&quot; <br/>\nby Libby Roderick and asked us to imagine ourselves saying that to the <br/>\nchild we were then. It tore me up. I cried and grieved for a long time. <br/>\nI still have an emotional response to thinking about that. It was a <br/>\npivotal moment in my life and in my relationship with my son. I didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant him to come to a point in his life 20 or 30 years down the road <br/>\nand have to endure such a deep feeling of despair and feeling unwanted. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that when you get to read it, you find yourself in a better <br/>\nplace than when you started out.

I&#39;m glad you wrote because it is specifically for recognizing what I can heal about myself that will allow me to be more connected to my girls, and also to learn to see them more as individuals...moving towards a radical unschooling lifestyle.  I have always been an attachment type parent with my girls, I just feel I need more tools, especially with them moving into their 3&#39;s and pushing every single button of every single unresolved issue I have going on!  I have many RU books already, and so this sounds like a fit for me right now...I&#39;ll just take what feels right for us and leave the rest like I do with everything else under the sun.
