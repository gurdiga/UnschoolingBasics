But it&#39;s better *not* to explain<br/>\nyourself if you&#39;re trying to *justify* your choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nJustifying gives away your power. It implies that<br/>\nyou need the other person&#39;s approval. It undermines<br/>\nyour self-confidence and distances you from your<br/>\nInner Guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;need&quot; to explain and justify your choices is<br/>\nbased on the &quot;need&quot; to be right. But if your parenting<br/>\nchoices are &quot;right,&quot; and the other person would parent<br/>\ndifferently, then s/he must be &quot;wrong.&quot; Once you get<br/>\nin that right/wrong mode, conflict or interpersonal<br/>\ntension is inevitable.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of explaining your parenting to others,<br/>\nsilently remind *yourself* that your choices are right<br/>\n*for you*, and your own approval is all you need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dailygroove.net/dont-explain\">http://dailygroove.net/dont-explain</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to forward this message to your friends!<br/>\n(Please include this paragraph and everything above.)<br/>\nCopyright (c) 2007 by Scott Noelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28695,"nextTopicId":28704}}
