You choose not to eat certain <br/>\nfoods because it makes you ill, feel bad, is risky for *your* body.  <br/>\nEven then, you do make a choice to eat that way.

However, they may make other choices, and <br/>\nin that, you can honor and respect their need to listen to their own <br/>\nbodies and make choices based on that.  They have a right to find out <br/>\nthose things for themselves, with your loving, accepting guidance. <br/>\nBut not your judgment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recall being present when one mom expressed her happiness that her <br/>\nchild decided not to go to Wendy&#39;s. It wasn&#39;t because she was happy <br/>\nthat he had free choice and he was listening to his body, but more <br/>\nbecause he had listened to her tell him that the food there wasn&#39;t <br/>\nparticularly good for him (and that she was obviously doing her job <br/>\nas a mom). He was trying to please her, not choosing freely, it <br/>\nseemed to me.  And while wanting to please someone you love is a good <br/>\nthing, it shouldn&#39;t be done out of fear of condemnation if you don&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, part of an RU life is giving choices, giving information (and it <br/>\nprobably should be personal information, because &quot;conventional <br/>\nwisdom&quot; changes all the time &lt;g&gt;), providing an array of things <br/>\n(whether that is food, tv, computer games, playing at the park, and <br/>\non and on), then accepting your children&#39;s choices as just as valid <br/>\nfor them as your choices are for you.

Not to mention that a plate of <br/>\nregular pasta or a baked potato has just as much impact on blood <br/>\nsugar highs/lows as chocolate chip cookies, would we then need to <br/>\nban -all- carbs? DS has never been regulated in what he eats (he&#39;s <br/>\nalmost 9). As a result, he&#39;s the least likely to eat more than he <br/>\nneeds in any regard (whether sweets or pasta or chips or whatever). <br/>\nSometimes, he eats lots of something for a time - and that&#39;s exactly <br/>\nwhat it is &quot;for a time&quot;. He&#39;s got a much healthier outlook toward <br/>\nfood than either of us grownups. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we have chosen to do is to explain my situation to him (as well <br/>\nas DH&#39;s hypertension - he can somewhat control it through <br/>\ndiet/exercise but there&#39;s also a genetic component in it as well), <br/>\nlots of discussion, communication, questions/answers, etc. If he&#39;s <br/>\neating something (cookie, chips, even raisins or whatever) and <br/>\noffers me some, I may have a little or I may say &quot;That&#39;s not a good <br/>\nchoice for me right now&quot; - I can *choose* to eat whatever I want, I <br/>\ntry to make the best *choice* I can at the time (for those with a <br/>\nBible bent, check out Paul&#39;s &quot;everything is lawful, not everything <br/>\nis profitable&quot;). That is, IMO, the key - not whether we ban this or <br/>\nthat thing but rather modeling making good choices and providing <br/>\ninformation and feedback - for instance &quot;I&#39;ve noticed that when you <br/>\nhaven&#39;t eaten some protein in a long while, you seem to get <br/>\nfrustrated more&quot; or &quot;we&#39;re using brown rice in this because it has <br/>\nmore minerals and protein than that quick white rice&quot;. We have a <br/>\nneat (colorful, fun) chart in the kitchen that lists vegetarian <br/>\nsources of all sorts of nutrients (not just vitamin C and protein <br/>\nbut also potassium, trace minerals, vitamin K, etc). We put it there <br/>\nto free up chalkboard space because DS wanted lists of proteins, <br/>\npotassium rich foods, and other stuff - the lists were taking over <br/>\nthe chalkboard. DS often refers to it either to check out what we&#39;re <br/>\nhaving for dinner (for instance) or to get ideas for what he&#39;d like <br/>\nto eat. DH and I have also chosen to be mostly meatless (still like <br/>\ncheeses and sushi) but we also make sure to have hot dogs on hand <br/>\nbecause DS likes them. He&#39;s fit, healthy, and has a positive <br/>\nrelationship to foods of all sorts - there&#39;s no &quot;Bad&quot; food <br/>\nand &quot;Good&quot; food, just &quot;food&quot;, no psychological ties to &quot;shoulds&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;shouldn&#39;ts&quot; and guilts and all that. &quot;good&quot; feed is that which <br/>\nfeeds a need at the time. &quot;bad&quot; food is that which is not the best <br/>\nchoice at the time - for me, for example, bananas are a &quot;bad&quot; food <br/>\nmost of the time because I&#39;ve found they do awful things to my blood <br/>\nsugar readings. Should we ban bananas? No - they are a great <br/>\npotassium source which is important in keeping DH&#39;s blood pressure <br/>\nregulated.<br/>\n<br/>\nBalance, communication, *choice*<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: hypotheticals WAS: More questions on limi ts......","postDate":"1179491741","msgId":23802,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxNjhEMjI1LUI5N0QtNDVENS05MzlGLUMxOEQxMTgyMkZDQ0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDcxNjcxNS45NjI1OC5xbUB3ZWI2MTAxMS5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDcxNjcxNS45NjI1OC5xbUB3ZWI2MTAxMS5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":23791,"nextInTopic":23807,"prevInTime":23801,"nextInTime":23803,"topicId":23791,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
