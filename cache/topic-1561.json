Works great for him. If we are going somewhere earlier, and he wants to join in, I prepare him with information. He&#39;s always up and ready in plenty of time. Sometimes he&#39;s nervous he won&#39;t be able to get up and says &quot;Mom, make SURE you wake me up&quot;.:)<br/>\nWe all honor each other&#39;s sleep schedules, we all have different needs.
