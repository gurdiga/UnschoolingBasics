So you and dh may want to brainstorm about what might help him get more sleep despite the noise ..ear plugs? a white noise machine? some other way to soundproff the room? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  For the kids ....mine are 4 and 5 and 8 so yes I completely understand about not understanding the difference. Most likely they want to respect their fathers need for sleep that at that age its really hard to remember to stay quiet. Encouraging all the lounder jumping arounds, running through the house screaming type activities during the day <br/>\n  and the lets watch a movie together or turn on the fill in game system here might help. <br/>\n  another thing that sounds silly but helps a friend of mine who has a dh with a similiar shift. <br/>\n  She several big construction paper circles to hang in the rooms red on one side , green on the other. When dad went to bed she would announce she was flipping to red and the red cirles were a reminder to keep the noise down and help dad sleep. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  nicole <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nSick sense of humor?
