Wanna come?&quot;<br/>\nYou might get surprised.  My mom is looking for the &quot;right tattoo.&quot;  She<br/>\nknows where she wants it (on the arch of her foot - I personally think it<br/>\nwould hurt and heal slowly, but it&#39;s her tat, her foot).  She just hasn&#39;t<br/>\nfound the right one yet.  I already know what 2 tats I&#39;m going to get ......<br/>\neventually.  One is my mom&#39;s signature.  She always signed all her letters<br/>\n&quot;OXOX, Mom&quot; The other is a sparrow for my dad.  But these are both &quot;memorial<br/>\ntats&quot; and I obviously don&#39;t want them until my parents have passed away (I&#39;m<br/>\nhoping I will be a REALLY old fart by then LOL!)  I almost got a hurricane<br/>\ntattoo after I made it through Ivan alive, but decided I was going to wait<br/>\nand do it for my 40th birthday.  That came around and we were so busy that I<br/>\njust never got around to it.  Now I&#39;m thinking that I still want to remember<br/>\nthat horrible experience in someway, but not sure if a hurricane symbol is<br/>\nthe right sign.  Maybe I&#39;ll figure that out after this hurricane season LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":179628783,"authorName":"Malinda","from":"&quot;Malinda&quot; &lt;saprswife@...&gt;","profile":"saprswife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: tattoo&#39;s; was post from anon member","postDate":"1154563839","msgId":16172,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhcmV0disybzgwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVhb3Q4cCt1cGo0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16094,"nextInTopic":16182,"prevInTime":16171,"nextInTime":16173,"topicId":16092,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
