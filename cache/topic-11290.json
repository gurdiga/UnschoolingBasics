If we had universities like they had back<br/>\nthen today I might have truly enjoyed my university experience!)  you had to<br/>\ntake very difficult oral and written exams.  They did this to keep the<br/>\n&quot;peasants&quot; from being able to attend the universities.  They did it as part<br/>\nof weeding out &quot;certain people.&quot;  The sad thing is that if your daddy had<br/>\nenough money you could know squat and get in (does that remind you of<br/>\nanyone?)

One being entrance<br/>\nexams.  For some reason there is this thought that our children need to be<br/>\n&quot;well rounded&quot; to succeed.

You probably would have to look in the New Age or Occult<br/>\nsections to find it.  It is a novel based in the future of a community that<br/>\nlives where everyone&#39;s talents are praised and revered.  Healers heal<br/>\nbecause that&#39;s what they want to do.  Artists create because they want to<br/>\ncreate.  Healers and artists are considered equal.  It is a socialist based<br/>\nsociety, so no one goes hungry or without basic needs met.  Everyone from<br/>\nthe healers to the artists from the clothiers to the teachers all help with<br/>\nthe &quot;distateful tasks&quot; like emptying composting toilets, pulling weeds, and<br/>\ntaking care of the children or very elderly.  children have as much of a<br/>\nright to speak at community meetings as adults.
