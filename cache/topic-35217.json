First I&#39;ll<br/>\nsupply a little background- we moved to Virginia from New York a year<br/>\nago. We stopped going to school, and we all discovered that we really<br/>\nlove being home. Our lives changed a LOT with the move and the<br/>\ndecision to stop going to school. Now we are returning to NY, job<br/>\nrelated reasons, to exactly the place we came from, and my daughter<br/>\nhas told me she wants to go back to school. She will be entering 8th<br/>\ngrade. I told her that is her decision and I&#39;ll help her with the<br/>\nwhole &quot;back to school&quot; thing, but in my secret heart I am really<br/>\nunhappy. I want so much for my daughter to stay outside of the school<br/>\nsystem, for a lot of reasons- I don&#39;t need to list them all, but I<br/>\nwill say that i want my daughter to live and learn and grow outside<br/>\nof that institution. The past year, I&#39;ve watched her really and truly<br/>\nblossom. She has had bouts of loneliness, because we are pretty<br/>\nisolated, but she did meet two girls near her age (13) who were both<br/>\nfantastic kids (unschooled for years). She started writing a lot,<br/>\nvery creative, interesting stories. She started to design her own<br/>\nclothing and now has really started to amaze me with her very<br/>\nindependent and beautiful &quot;style&quot;. She also began to really, in my<br/>\nopinion, get to know and love herself. She chose what she wanted to<br/>\ndo and she did it. She left behind some people and ideas and totally<br/>\nstarted coming into her own.<br/>\nNow we are returning and she wants to go back to school. She has a<br/>\nfriend there (in school) who always seemed to me to overpower my<br/>\ndaughter. My daughter would do whatever this other girl asked of her,<br/>\nand on the several occasions when she did not want to, she was made<br/>\nto suffer some weird psychological consequences by either the girl or<br/>\nher family. The whole family was quite overbearing- for example, if<br/>\nmy daughter chose not to attend a sleepover at the girl&#39;s house, the<br/>\nmom would email my daughter, using her daughter&#39;s account, and tell<br/>\nmy daughter how hurt and saddened she and her daughter were by my<br/>\ndaughter&#39;s decision. This kind of stuff happened every time my<br/>\ndaughter would choose not to do whatever the other girl wanted. I<br/>\nwould talk with her about it and try to reassure her that she was<br/>\nallowed to make her own decisions, but she always caved in to the<br/>\nother family and did what they wanted. I was even then trying to let<br/>\nmy daughter choose for herself but now I wonder if I was setting a<br/>\nprecedent that I&#39;d let other people boss her around.<br/>\nSo I&#39;m worried for my newly independent girl. Not only will she be<br/>\ngoing back to prison, I mean, school, but she will also be going back<br/>\nto this friend who she always caved in to. I haven&#39;t said much except<br/>\naxpressed how excited I have been to see my daughter doing her own<br/>\nthing. I haven&#39;t said &quot;PLEASE, don&#39;t give in!!!&quot; but my heart is in<br/>\nmy throat at the very thought of her going back.<br/>\nI also told her that it is her choice to return to school and it is<br/>\nher choice to stay. She can leave at any time. I want her to see<br/>\nschool as something she is choosing to do.<br/>\nAny words of wisdom? I&#39;m really feeling like my daughter&#39;s future is<br/>\nhanging in the balance here. I know that&#39;s black and white thinking,<br/>\nbut it feels real.
