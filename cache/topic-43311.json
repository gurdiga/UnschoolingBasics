I want to say effortless but that&#39;s not the right word, there&#39;s effort involved, but its not a labor or a chore. It starts to happen naturally. Do you remember learning how to drive? (or type or knit or ice skate... something you do well now but didn&#39;t come naturally to you). Remember how at first you had to stop and think what to do? But at some point maybe someone asked you &quot;how do you do that?&quot; and you realized aha! I&#39;ve learned a lot! Unschooling can be like that.

One of the advantages of unschooling is you don&#39;t have to be going a million places all the time. For younger kids, especially, lots of long slow days at home can be really wonderful. It gives them a chance to be in a comfortable environment, a space where its safe to explore and discover. As kids get older, they&#39;ll Want to expand that comfort zone. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Am I attracted to unschooling for my benefit, because it sounds like much<br/>\n&gt; harder work than packing them off to school?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does it sound like hard work to you? Learning anything new can be challenging, and learning about unschooling is no different. It takes time and practice, and at first it can seem difficult and unnatural - you&#39;re changing habits of thought and expectation along with behavior and that takes some work. But once you&#39;re done deschooling and actually unschooling, its not so much work. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning I helped Mo make a batch of pretend fish-sticks for her flock of stuffed penguins. We talked about fish, about the movie we watched last night, about the seeds sprouting on the living room table and the possibility of buying mixed Bionicle parts. At the same time, George took Ray to the grocery and bank before dropping him off at work. That&#39;s our unschooling life this morning - hardly a massive effort. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I&#39;m aware that by not doing<br/>\n&gt; something as universal as sending them to school, I am making my kids<br/>\n&gt; different from everyone else.  What if they just want to fit in with<br/>\n&gt; everyone else?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If they do, and you&#39;re unschooling, then you&#39;ll help them find ways to do that. Maybe they&#39;ll want to try school for a little or a long time. Maybe they&#39;ll be happy at home but want to join a club or sport that&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; and downplay the fact that they&#39;re homeschoolers. Maybe they&#39;ll want to go to college or join the military just like thousands of other young adults. The difference with unschooling is that they&#39;re in charge of those decisions rather than making them out of some kind of psychological inertia. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re:Can anyone unschool?","postDate":"1268314874","msgId":43318,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NkRFRERFQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":43315,"nextInTopic":43324,"prevInTime":43317,"nextInTime":43319,"topicId":43311,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There s no Just to going to the park, the zoo, the library, having friends over to play.

Those are rich experiences - even if it&#39;s the same<br/>\nstuff you are doing now (why is it less &quot;rich&quot; if you&#39;re unschooling<br/>\nthan it is now?) There are unschoolers who don&#39;t have a zoo within a<br/>\nday&#39;s drive. Others have to drive over an hour to find a decent library.<br/>\nSome have no vehicle available most of the time so getting out and about<br/>\nas you describe is rare. Yet they all unschool and their kids are<br/>\nwonderful, growing, learning, exploring, thinking people. <br/>\n<br/>\nDrop the idea of unschooling &quot;properly&quot; - no such animal exists. That&#39;s<br/>\nlike saying that a particular lifestyle is how to live &quot;properly&quot;. Yet,<br/>\nevery family/household has a different lifestyle and that&#39;s great!<br/>\n&quot;Properly&quot; implies that there is one right way to do everything - that<br/>\neveryone &quot;should be&quot; living in a suburban house with 2 cars, 2 kids, a<br/>\ndog, a cat, maybe some other small animal (hamster, fish, parakeet),<br/>\nswing set in the yard, cookies baking in the oven. But, some families<br/>\nlive in 2 bedroom apartments in an urban area and walk, bike, use mass<br/>\ntransit to get around, no pets, and eat lots of take out from local<br/>\nethnic restaurants. And others live on working organic farms an hour<br/>\nfrom town. And it&#39;s all good. Some folks are wonderful farmers who can<br/>\nmake anything grow abundantly, some of us can kill any houseplant ever<br/>\nmade (cacti, philodendrons, etc all those hardy &quot;unkillable&quot; ones).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re paying attention to the kids, listening to them, watching<br/>\nthem, being involved WITH them, you&#39;re not going to miss much that they<br/>\nare needing - they&#39;ll tell you, in one way or another. Whether you have<br/>\naccess to it right then and there is a different question - time, space,<br/>\nmoney, logistics all play a part. When you are in partnership with your<br/>\nkids, they come to trust that you will do whatever you can to provide<br/>\nthem the resources they are wanting - even if it takes some creative<br/>\nfinagling to do so (bartering stable help for riding lessons, trading<br/>\nchild care for access to a swimming pool, whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

But I think unschooling is really hard. It gets less hard, the more you do it, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it is an easy task. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My suggestion is that you ask yourself really honestly, is there<br/>\nsomething more I could be doing for my child that would enhance my<br/>\nchild’s life? If the answer is yes, then make the choice to do it. Then<br/>\nask this question of yourself again and again and, each time, make the<br/>\nlife-enriching choice. Apply this to small things and to big momentous<br/>\ndecisions. Small things – could I make something for dinner that would<br/>\nbe special and interesting? Did I see a cool rock on the ground outside<br/>\n– could I bring it in and wash it and set it on the table for others to<br/>\nnotice. Big things – would my child enjoy traveling – can we take a<br/>\nfamily vacation that involves exploring things my child would find<br/>\ninteresting?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that is a wonderful approach to unschooling, a procession of choices, each one more life-enriching than the last. Instead of looking at the years ahead of you, look at this moment and the next and the next one and move toward making each of those better. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":351836297,"authorName":"Amanda Mayan","from":"&quot;Amanda Mayan&quot; &lt;amanda@...&gt;","profile":"amandabpearl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:Can anyone unschool?","postDate":"1268309404","msgId":43314,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzkwMWNhYzExMyRjYTA1ODgyMCQ1ZTEwOTg2MCRAdXM+"},"prevInTopic":43311,"nextInTopic":43315,"prevInTime":43313,"nextInTime":43315,"topicId":43311,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am sure you will get more comprehensive answers from others, but it seems to me, with children that age, that you are doing exactly what you and they need,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-707383504\">I am sure you will get more comprehensive answers from others, but it seems<br/>\nto me, with children that age, that you are doing exactly what you and they<br/>\nneed, at this moment in time.you can&#39;t really expect children that young to<br/>\ndisplay some of the passions and in depth interests that an older child<br/>\nmight.maybe your almost 2 or 3 year old LOVES animals, so the zoo is<br/>\nwonderful for them.think about all that they learn about how to play with<br/>\nothers when visiting friends.or what they can learn and see just by visiting<br/>\nthe grocery with you.in an organic way .
