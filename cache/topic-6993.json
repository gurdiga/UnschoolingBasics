We had <br/>\noriginally planned to send Kiah to a Christian school for Kinder. <br/>\nbut had been leaning towards homeschool and decided to go for it.  <br/>\nWe just got started last week.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually bought a whole curriculium and have since realized what a <br/>\nmistake that was.  Math and reading books are way too easy for <br/>\nher... science and history books are IMHO for an 8 year old, not a 5 <br/>\nyo so she&#39;s bored with those and confused at the concepts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been reading a lot about unschooling and am intrigued by the <br/>\nconcept.  I would love to know (besides this list) what other <br/>\nresources I can access to learn more and see if it is for us.  I <br/>\nknow we will be more relaxed homeschoolers but not sure if <br/>\nunschooling is the way we want to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice, tips or suggestions are much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6988,"nextTopicId":6999}}
