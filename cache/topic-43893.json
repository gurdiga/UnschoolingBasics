In my experience, there are some kids that don&#39;t ask. They take. My 16 month old recently stole a drink of my husband&#39;s beer. We did not give it to her. We had to take care of a mess that my 3 year old created and my husband sat his beer down to help me. Before we knew it, she had taken a drink. We swapped her drink for my husband&#39;s beer. Nobody made a big deal out of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest daughter was younger, she threw a fit to get a drink of what daddy had. We tried to distract her and offer her something else to no avail. Finally, my husband let her have a sip. She proceeded to spit it out and say yuck. The taste was so horrible to her that she threw up. My 5 year old has no desire to drink it because she has sniffed daddy&#39;s beer and thinks that it stinks. I was never comfortable with letting them taste the alcohol but it came down to how do you not make it a big deal when a child is insisting on having a drink or tasting what daddy has. If you have a kid that is cool with no, then it isn&#39;t a big issue. You tell them no and you move on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;For me personally &#39;If&#39; I did give alcohol to my baby and they did end up having a problem I would wonder if I had encouraged that by feeding it to them when they didnt have the knowledge and understanding to make that decision for themselves - particularly due to the fact it is in our immediate family. I know that this is probably seen as controlling or avoiding by some, however a baby doesnt know whats s/he is asking for other than its something Mom or Dad are drinking - I don&#39;t see any problem with substituting at this age.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t imagine feeding my kids alcohol. It would be really weird to go up to a baby and say, &quot;Here, do you want to have a beer with daddy? Take a drink.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our house, it has always been the kids being curious and asking about what daddy is drinking. My 5 year old was content to smell it and that was it. She had no desire to even taste it based on just the smell. My 3 year old has never really cared either. My oldest has expressed curiosity and doesn&#39;t easily take no for an answer. She can&#39;t stand the taste of anything but champagne. We get sparkling grape juice as a substitute on New Year&#39;s or other such occasions. That satisfies everybody. How do you substitute in the moment without making a big deal about it when you have a very persistent little one? For us, it has always been easiest to let them have a tiny sip to satisfy the curiosity. Most of the the time, they think it is yucky and that is the end of it. On the rare occasion that they have liked it, my husband will get up and make them a non-alcoholic drink of their own. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG - www.avg.com <br/>\nVersion: 9.0.819 / Virus Database: 271.1.1/2866 - Release Date: 05/10/10 13:26:00<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: candy candy candy!!","postDate":"1273598277","msgId":43968,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhzYzNnNSttb2VqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDcxMjkxRTc5LUU2MEUtNEIxMy04QzAwLTNCQzFDMDFDQTY5MEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":43959,"nextInTopic":43974,"prevInTime":43967,"nextInTime":43969,"topicId":43893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In addition to everything Joyce said, I recall a concern about teeth being brought up.

It can help to research alternatives ways to have oral hygine (I&#39;m hoping Alex posts the link, but there&#39;s a yahoo group on the subject...something like alternative kids teeth).

There are a lot of things that we don&#39;t have in our house because they don&#39;t interest us or some other reason. Unless you live in a vacuum, kids will know about alcohol. They may see it mentioned in movies or on TV. You may be out to dinner sometime and see/hear somebody that has had too much to drink. You may be at a wedding or even a church where alcohol is being served. The opportunities for kids to be introduced to stuff that we don&#39;t have in our house are limitless and there is no way that you can plan for every single eventuality. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have always tried to leave communication open so that if there is something that our kids see or hear about and want to know about, then they know they can come to us. As an example, my 8 year old recently asked me about poll dancing and strip clubs. I would never ever deliberately expose her to that. Frankly, I was a bit mortified and had to check myself to make sure that I was not being alarmist or freaking out. She heard about it from somewhere and came to me. We had an open and honest discussion about it even though it was not something that I have in my house. I have figured out that it is easiest to just live life and take things as they come. Your child may not ever have an interest in alcohol just like my 5 year old may never ask about poll dancing. It is really hard to predict what will pique a child&#39;s curiosity and what won&#39;t. We can go somewhere with our kids and each kid will come away with something different.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: alchol consumption and a toddler","postDate":"1273534588","msgId":43947,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhzYTU5cytpbzIwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltUWtLTzFFMUJQZ0VBWlB5blNmYU9obVI4eU95a1ZoNlJjeWpPS0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43946,"nextInTopic":43948,"prevInTime":43946,"nextInTime":43948,"topicId":43893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Radically  <br/>\nunschooled kids have free access to TV, video games, books, people,  <br/>\nfood that spans a nutrition spectrum. Even pornography over the  <br/>\ninternet.

But intent doesn&#39;t change how actions feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest thing that&#39;s missing in the lives of radically unschooled  <br/>\nkids is control. (And school, but that&#39;s a form of control too.) Not  <br/>\nlacking guidance! Not lacking connection! Not lacking help!

Its a good window, though, into something that&#39;s really very common in multi-child families - rules frequently change significantly with younger children as parents get used to the idea that there aren&#39;t nearly as many &quot;speeding trucks&quot; in life as it seems with the first, precious child. <br/>\n<br/>\nRay having been such an over-the-top kid made it a whole lot easier for me to decide to unschool Mo from the start. It was easier to say &quot;yes&quot; knowing the kinds of headaches I had from &quot;nos&quot; in the past. It was easier to say &quot;yes&quot; knowing what kinds of things Ray had done *despite* my &quot;nos&quot; in the past! Having been dragged well outside the limits of my comfort zone by Ray made it a whoooole lot easier to take little steps outside my comfort zone the second time around.

Whole life unschooling takes a different skill-set than other kinds of parenting - its important to know that! That&#39;s one of the reasons unschoolers recommend easing in to unschooling, and that&#39;s especially the case with younger children (and first time parents). Most of the &quot;unschooling skill-set&quot; involves thinking ahead, being proactive. Get the wiggles out *before* getting in the car-seat. Offer nutrient-dense snackes *before* kids are hungry. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling assumes rules and imposed limits aren&#39;t a good solution. That&#39;s the reason behind not using them. Its not a rule &quot;no rules&quot; - its an awareness that they don&#39;t do much good, and can do a whole lot of harm. But to live without rules takes some practice! So please, please! don&#39;t jump in to the deep end and shout &quot;no more rules&quot;. Ease in. Learn as you go, but give yourself plenty of time to learn and practice. Realize you&#39;ll make mistakes, or not always be sure what&#39;s &quot;better&quot;. Its okay. Its a process. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;That&#39;s not because he&#39;s a good kid or I&#39;m a fantastic parent, per se<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I really do think Ray&#39;s a great person, btw, and I know for sure that I have lots more and better parenting skills than I did before.

There<br/>\nsimply isn&#39;t anything to rebel against because they haven&#39;t had 15+ yrs of<br/>\nyou getting between something they wanted to do and them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two boys 13 and 11 and now that we have deschooled, it&#39;s AMAZING to<br/>\nme how much they hang out with us.  I *NEVER* wanted to be with my mother at<br/>\nthis age.  And I loved her but I wanted to be alone or with my friends...or<br/>\nyes, at 17, having sex in my boyfriend&#39;s car.

(My father was long<br/>\ngone.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can control them when they are small but know that it&#39;s an illusion.<br/>\nYou aren&#39;t creating respect by disrespecting them.

I think it does everyone a disservice to catstrophize like<br/>\nthat.  One final thing which I guess not too many people know...sugar<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t cause cavities.  I took HORRID care of my teeth almost all my first<br/>\n2 decades and even now flossing is a once a year ritual...I&#39;m 39 and I have<br/>\nno cavities.  Whether or not you get cavities depends on the roll of the<br/>\ngenetic dice.  To harp at your kid about this, is to essentially blame her<br/>\nfor whatever she inherited via your dna.  That hardly seems fair.  So you<br/>\nshould knock that off if you can&#39;t let go of anything else.  Because if your<br/>\nkid has crappy enamel and dentin, and she gets a cavity or more after<br/>\nlistening to you harp about tooth care you will blame her for her bad luck.<br/>\nThat&#39;s not going to bring you closer either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n&quot;Correlation does not imply causation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a<br/>\nnail.&quot; Abraham Maslow<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: alchol consumption and a toddler","postDate":"1273519917","msgId":43940,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhzOW12ZCs4OWs1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCRTc0NDQxLjYwMzAxMDRAY2xlYW5mcmVha3NjYXJwZXRjYXJlLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43929,"nextInTopic":43941,"prevInTime":43939,"nextInTime":43941,"topicId":43893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I don&#39;t have kids who follow rules unless they want to - and that&#39;s Normal human behavior. That&#39;s the trouble with rules - they only work when they&#39;re followed, and people only follow them when they Choose to do so. I can make all the rules I want about snakes, enforce them as hard as I want, and that won&#39;t stop my busy, curious, strong minded kids from picking them up. And yet, without rules or enforcement, they both know not to try to pick up a snake without first ascertaining that its not venomous. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow that happens is what this list is about - how to get from rules to no rules safely. It means a whole lot of slowing down and honoring kids wants and wishes in the moment so that they&#39;re not overwhelmed with curiosity or enthusiasm, or fight/flight in the moment. It means taking chance comments and the whims of 2yos seriously.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Now once my child wanted to just <br/>\n&gt; run across a busy road because she wanted to...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wish there were giant billboards everywhere telling parents this is something very young children are prone to do. Yes! Little kids get all excited, see an expanse of space and dash into it - that&#39;s what they do. It helps to know that. Making a rule won&#39;t stop a young child from doing that. Enforcing the rule won&#39;t stop the young child from doing that. Its a perfect example of why rules are useless. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have an energetic young child, don&#39;t go near busy roads when you&#39;re tired or distracted. That&#39;s called thinking ahead. If you have to go near a busy road when you&#39;re tired or distracted, take some other safety precaustion - a stroller, a carrier, a shopping cart, your arms, heck, even one of those kid leases is a better option than expecting &quot;stay here&quot; will do  your work for you. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I think that some things are so <br/>\n&gt; addictive and destructive to the human brain and body that we need <br/>\n&gt; safeguards <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>School is the most destructive thing there is, as far as the human brain is concerned. Seriously, there are a whooooole lot of problems that fall by the wayside when kids aren&#39;t being forced to do something on a daily basis. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Such as violent video games, television, pornography, war <br/>\n&gt; and drugs just to name a few.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a 16yo male in my home. He&#39;s not addicted to any of those things. That&#39;s not because he&#39;s a good kid or I&#39;m a fantastic parent, per se, its because he has a whole lot of choices in his life. He doesn&#39;t have to use sex, drugs, porn, or violence to prove he&#39;s a man. He just came back from a weekend rock concert that he attended with a group of folks in their 20s. He&#39;s not hung over or dragged out - he didn&#39;t even smell bad when he came in. That&#39;s pretty impressive for someone who&#39;s been up for two days, with money in his pocket and all the booze and drugs he could want. He *wants* very little of that - and as someone confident in his choices he doesn&#39;t feel the pressure other kids his age do to &quot;try this&quot; in order to fit in or feel good about himself. He Already feels good about himself. That&#39;s how the &quot;feel good&quot; part of unschooling works - our kids are happy to be Who They Are, rather than a drugged-out version of who they are. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: alchol consumption and a toddler","postDate":"1273487863","msgId":43929,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhzOG5sbitpOTRtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAyZDYwMWNhZWY3OSQ5MGFkZjAwMCRiMjA5ZDAwMCRAdXM+"},"prevInTopic":43928,"nextInTopic":43940,"prevInTime":43928,"nextInTime":43930,"topicId":43893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe alcohol needs to stop being a presence in your home.

It&#39;s next to the fruit bowl, there are lollipops and tootsie rolls and candy bars in it. I try and keep it fairly full most of the time. If I see something that looks tasty at the store I&#39;ll buy it and pop it in there. I don&#39;t have to add to it very often. There are times when it diminishes, but mostly it isn&#39;t rushed at or devoured with abandon. It&#39;s an option. I also have a bowl of celery and carrots cut up in the fridge in water (it keeps them fresher tasting, crisper). I refill that far more frequently. Bagels get eaten faster than cake. I made a carrot cake the other day, Simon likes carrot cake more than most cakes, he&#39;s not a cake fan, and it was too sweet for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou wrote that your daughter wanted to run across a busy road one day and that you kept her safe rather than letting her run. It&#39;s an oft used argument for limits. Why did she want to run across a busy road? Did she want to play in the expanse of concrete? That could be met by going to a less busy road. Was there something on the other side she wanted to get to? A playful sweep into your arms and a movement forward and across at a safe time or place would achieve her goal. Unschooling is about finding ways to support a child interests. If you look to why she wanted to cross that road at that time there may have been more approaches than having it entrench your belief that children need rules to keep them safe. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are forces at work in the world who could care less about my <br/>\nchild and only see them as a means to wealth and power.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping my children to be strong in themselves, supporting their interests and passions, trusting their opinions and tastes, well that has made them less susceptible to the needs of others to make a profit. I have often tried to buy something for Simon or Linnaea and been turned down because, well, it isn&#39;t really what they want. If I had limited them, if I hadn&#39;t support Linnaea&#39;s desire to buy bouncy ball after bouncy ball after bouncy ball from the vending machine, she wouldn&#39;t have such an amazing sense of fullness.

He didn&#39;t like it - he&#39;s very physical and social and being buzzed made him feel stupid and inept. That led to a dilema - drink more and desensitize a little, or stop fire spitting?

But -- and this is just a guess,  <br/>\nbased on personal experience as a kid -- I would bet she would stop  <br/>\nonce she started feeling odd. Odd would feel like enough.

My  <br/>\nparents let us have sips of mixed drinks and beer whenever we asked,  <br/>\nbrandy (a tablespoon or two) when we came in from skiing when it was  <br/>\nvery cold. More significantly, when we went to my grandmother&#39;s for  <br/>\nSunday dinner, my aunt always served wine or very strong alcoholic  <br/>\ndrinks directly to us with dinner. I don&#39;t remember ever finishing  <br/>\none. Sometimes I&#39;d just have a sip.

Limits are fine <br/>\nand sometimes they need enforcing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam Dealan-de<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 5/9/2010 6:14 AM, Amanda Mayan wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not sure how to handle this..hoping for suggestions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband and I drink a bit of alcohol..we share a glass of wine or a<br/>\n&gt; bottle of beer during dinner.or he&#39;ll have a vodka and cranberry when he<br/>\n&gt; comes home from work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We don&#39;t drink every single night, but alcohol is definitely a presence in<br/>\n&gt; our house.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our 3 year old likes to drink with us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to make it an &quot;issue&quot; that she focuses on.or make it into a<br/>\n&gt; desirable forbidden.I also think that telling her &quot;it&#39;s for adults&quot; could<br/>\n&gt; lead to problems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m particularly keyed into this issue because I grew up with a mostly <br/>\n&gt; sober<br/>\n&gt; (though with rare relapses every decade or so) father<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When we have a drink and she asks for it, I always offer her juice or <br/>\n&gt; water<br/>\n&gt; instead, so she has options. many times she&#39;ll say she wants &quot;just a sip&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and then chug.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m totally not comfortable with this, but totally not sure how to handle<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve explained to her that it could make her feel funny, or make her tummy<br/>\n&gt; hurt and little people can have little amounts only<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve tried fancy sodas in bottles, so she has a &quot;special&quot; drink too.she<br/>\n&gt; really likes the alcohol (particularly mikes hard lemonade, which doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; even taste like alcohol!).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do we just not have it around?

Or beer or vodka and cranberry for that matter, whatever y&#39;all are having, drop a little in a cup of water for her. If you&#39;re using nice glasses, give her a fancy glass too - that&#39;s sometimes part of the appeal, and you can find plastic stemware at party shops if breakage is a concern. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your husband especially likes the hard lemonade, have some regular lemonade around and use that as the &quot;mixer&quot;. For the vodka and cranberry, mix it heavy on the juice with a tiny dribble of vodka. Make it normal, not something she has to even ask for, the same way you&#39;d offer her some of what you&#39;re eating for dinner. Its perfectly common to modify food for kids - less sauce, less pepper, whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, as a side note, my husband, who grew up in another country and was<br/>\n&gt; given sips of an ouzo like drink  when he had belly aches as a child,<br/>\n&gt; specifically remembers lying about tummy aches as a young child to get the<br/>\n&gt; sips.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kids often want to do what adults are doing, and while many kids don&#39;t like the taste of alcohol, some don&#39;t mind the strong flavor. If something is restricted, &quot;adults only&quot; except for special circumstances, then its natural for kids to be sneaky and dishonest. That&#39;s not a matter of alcohol, specifically - is that your fear? That she&#39;s predisposed to drink and this is some kind of &quot;evidence&quot;? I have alcoholism in both sets of grandparents, so my brother and I are arguably predisposed toward alcoholism, and yet he drinks moderately and I sparingly. We had watered down drinks and it was never really questioned that we would want to do what the grown-ups were doing, just that body size and weight was a consideration. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":351836297,"authorName":"Amanda Mayan","from":"&quot;Amanda Mayan&quot; &lt;amanda@...&gt;","profile":"amandabpearl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"alchol consumption and a toddler","postDate":"1273410871","msgId":43893,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyZDYwMWNhZWY3OSQ5MGFkZjAwMCRiMjA5ZDAwMCRAdXM+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43899,"prevInTime":43892,"nextInTime":43894,"topicId":43893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Not sure how to handle this..hoping for suggestions.
