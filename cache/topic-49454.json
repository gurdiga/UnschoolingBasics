And I&#39;m speaking more broadly rather than specifically to your situation so it may not apply. This society tends to focus on ends and finding means to those ends. Parents can end up thinking, &quot;If only they&#39;d get more into science kits and experiments! Being interested in them is a pathway to a great career in science!&quot; And then focus on finding that one perfect science project that will spark their interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that point, the problem is the parent has shifted her view from her kids to the science experiments. She isn&#39;t seeing the doorways her kids are fascinated by but the doorways she thinks her kids would benefit by being fascinated by.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids -- all people really -- have &quot;interest magnets&quot; inside of them. What they pull towards them gives others clues about what kind of magnets each has inside. We can&#39;t change the nature of those magnets by pushing things at them. We can, though, help their unique set of magnets grow by noticing what kids pull towards them and giving them more and by putting in reach stuff that feels related that also might interest them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids never get into problem solving games, that&#39;s okay. It won&#39;t hurt their problem solving abilities ;-) It will, though, indicate they are looking at life through different lenses, lenses that aren&#39;t about hard core problem solving. They might be more interested in relationships or patterns. By looking at what interests them, look for lots of different ways for them to explore those interests. If they love TV shows, give them more TV shows and stuff related to the shows they love. If they love being with friends, give them more opportunities to be with friends. Whatever they&#39;re drawn to is what&#39;s important to what&#39;s inside of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat might help you see more pathways to connect outward from your girls -- rather than getting your girls to connect to the world -- is the Facebook group:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Unschooler is interested in ...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/383815885025681/\">http://www.facebook.com/groups/383815885025681/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":496299932,"authorName":"Cheri Stewart","from":"Cheri Stewart &lt;cheristewart@...&gt;","profile":"ctysttexas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Video game recommendations please","postDate":"1359115887","msgId":49455,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZFMkExMUFFLTI4MzUtNDlCMS1COERELUIxMzMwMzY2MEI2NUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDlFREQ3M0MzLTRCNkUtNEM0MS1CQjI5LTY3RTBENUIxMzUxRUBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDlFREQ3M0MzLTRCNkUtNEM0MS1CQjI5LTY3RTBENUIxMzUxRUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49454,"nextInTopic":49457,"prevInTime":49454,"nextInTime":49456,"topicId":49454,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Scribblenauts Unlimited!

I love the idea that video games can require problem solving, persistence in trying to complete a quest, and enduring failure along the way.  And that they can be darn fun, apparently, too!  I just have no idea where these games can be found.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do not have Wii or Xbox or whatever else may be required.  We do, however, have a couple of good computers, so we could play online games, or games that came on a cd-rom.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy girls have played Disney Fairies.  They have also played Marc Brown Arthur educational games, and ClueFinders educational games.
