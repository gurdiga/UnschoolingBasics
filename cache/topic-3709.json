Parents commented about how much better their children were doing in school and that their kids were in less trouble with authorities.  The parents were thrilled and were willing to pay the extra cost to continue the food program the next year.  The school district refused and &quot;oddly enough&quot; the school reverted back to the way it was.  :-(  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do believe that there are children who learn from kinesthitic opportunies.  In fact I think that many children learn well this way.

I look back at my brother&#39;s life growing up.  Had we been born in a different era he would have been classified as ADHD.   He had all the character traits for ADHD.  What my mom figured out was that A)  my brother reacted certain ways to certain foods (primarily caffeine, sugar and corn) and B) my brother did better in classes where he could move or do something rather than sit and listen.  He did well in sports not because he enjoyed sports but because he enjoyed moving.  Had we been products of the 90&#39;s rather than the 60&#39;s he would have been doped up on ritalin.

I&#39;ve never told him that he is autistic and rarely think about it myself (except on those really trying days when I remind myself that he is acting this way because of the socio-tactile-physical displacers that are causing him to act out - and then I act appropriately to try to work with these needs of his.)  I&#39;ve never looked at his autistic tendencies as disabling.  If anything they allow him to do and feel things that he might otherwise not notice or be concerned.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; So yeah, there are traits that make it possible to label <br/>\n&gt; someone &quot;ADD&quot;, but I believe with unschooling those traits are <br/>\n&gt; strengths, not weaknesses and there is no need for the child to ever <br/>\n&gt; feel &quot;less than&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Next time I&#39;m going to say, &quot;Ren tell them what I mean, &#39;cause my brains all muddled from not having enough tea.&quot;  :-)  Sorry for the poor wording.

They process and record things thought feelings. They need to be<br/>\nmoving to learn, they seem distracted and to not be listening, because they<br/>\nmight not be looking you in the eye (which most teachers demand as a sign of<br/>\nrespect). They learn in a different way, not worse or better just different.<br/>\nThe current school system doesn&#39;t allow for kids who learn differently, it<br/>\njust isn&#39;t practical for a class of 35 to have 10 of these kids bouncing on<br/>\nrebounders while they listen and participate in the class. However, I<br/>\nbelieve that if they could they would be learning as quickly as other kids,<br/>\nbecause their personal learning needs were being met. Being forced to sit<br/>\nstill in a chair and not talk and look in one place for any length of time,<br/>\nis similar to torture and in my experience results in the total<br/>\ndisconnection of the learning process for these kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe words the teacher uses can also affect their ability to learn. SO if the<br/>\nteacher was a visual learner, she would be using words like see, visualize,<br/>\nimagine, focus, clear, bright, colourful and shiny etc. While a kinesthetic<br/>\nlearner wouldn&#39;t be able to process those words, they would be looking for<br/>\nwords like feel, touch, grasp, caress and rub to help them internalize and<br/>\nprocess their learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell that was a fun way to remember my NLP training and to remind me why<br/>\nHannah and I have some of our conflicts we do...
