There  <br/>\nare plenty of states without any homeschooling law (private school  <br/>\nstates, for example). And there are states where there are other,  <br/>\noften better, options for homeschooling in ways other than their  <br/>\nspecific homeschooling law. Also, the legal statutes can be very  <br/>\ncomplicated and it can be difficult to figure out what you actually  <br/>\nare required to &quot;do&quot; based on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalifornia has no law, right now. Texas has a court decision, not a  <br/>\nstatute. There are lots of other states that don&#39;t have  <br/>\nstraightforward homeschooling law.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot being a state organization, HSLDA tends to be slightly &quot;off&quot; in  <br/>\nthe way they convey the information - it isn&#39;t presented in a way that  <br/>\nis realistic, not necessarily presented the way the laws are carried  <br/>\nout in practice. And the wording is sometimes oddly misleading.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, in California, it says one option is to &quot;qualify as a  <br/>\nprivate school.&quot;  That makes it sound like you have to be approved to  <br/>\nbe a private school, that there is something you have to do to  <br/>\nqualify. But that is totally wrong - you become a private school by  <br/>\nsimply being one. The minute you decide to take your own child&#39;s  <br/>\neducation into your own hands, you ARE a private school. You don&#39;t  <br/>\nhave to qualify at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option we have here is to enroll our kids in a private school  <br/>\nindependent study program - but HSLDA uses the term &quot;satellite  <br/>\nprogram.&quot; That is misleading - we don&#39;t call these private school  <br/>\nisp&#39;s &quot;satellite programs.&quot; That term is commonly used for brick and  <br/>\nmortar schools with one main campus and other &quot;satellite&quot; campuses.  <br/>\nBut many of the private isp&#39;s are not associated with any brick and  <br/>\nmortar school - there is no main campus to be a satellite of.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany many Californians homeschool through charter school programs.  <br/>\nThese are different than public school district independent study  <br/>\nprograms - they operate under different regulations. But, because they  <br/>\nare also government funded, HSLDA doesn&#39;t differentiate between public  <br/>\nschool isp&#39;s and charter school programs. It is an important  <br/>\ndistinction to many California homeschoolers, but HSLDA completely  <br/>\nignores it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHSLDA is not a state-level organization, they consist of a few  <br/>\nattorneys, each representing a large number of states, they just don&#39;t  <br/>\nquite get things as &quot;right&quot; as the state organizations do.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Do I need to officially withdraw my daughter?","postDate":"1209392959","msgId":32188,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFCOEQ5OUMyLTQ5MTQtNEI3RS1BRDFGLUU3RDJFRjFFQzc3M0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1Mzk1NzAxQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+","referencesHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1Mzk1NzAxQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":32183,"nextInTopic":32189,"prevInTime":32187,"nextInTime":32189,"topicId":32149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
