I have a couple pumpkin <br/>\nplants in the yard. <br/>\n I decided when we moved here that I would try this because I hate the <br/>\nway the fruit and vegies from the store taste- having grown up part <br/>\ntime on my grandparents farm I know the difference! I am still trying <br/>\nto talk my husband into chickens, he is *very* reluctant to have them.<br/>\nI would prefer fresh eggs (I had those as a kid too and wow the taste <br/>\ndifference is amazing!) but they are very costly and I do a lot of <br/>\nbaking so use a lot of eggs.<br/>\n<br/>\n Even with my little container garden, My husband and son dont like <br/>\nvegies unless they are in somthing sweet (like pumpkin bread) they are <br/>\nmainly interested in meat, fats and starch. (I even planted cucumbers <br/>\nsince my husband said he loves them,- he ate 4 and then decided he <br/>\ndidnt like them *that much*) I am happy that they will eat dry beans <br/>\nwhen I cook them tho. I however want to eat diferently- so I do. Often <br/>\nI will just have a cheese and tomato sandwhich. I love those and my <br/>\ntomatos taste so fresh and good!<br/>\n One meal a day has been the patern for about 10 years, we are not as <br/>\nhealthy as we could be, we realy need to get out and be more active <br/>\n(right now my husband is laid up from knee surgery so this summer is <br/>\nnot as active as usual for us)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for malnutrition, well I cant say it is an impossibility but this <br/>\nis how it is for now and honestly, its the best its been in the past <br/>\n10 years so I can&#39;t complain at all! (and I hope I didnt sound like I <br/>\nwas trying to) we have been on foodstamps in the past and it is a <br/>\nNightmare! we no longer qualify because things have changed. we don&#39;t <br/>\nmeet the requirements by a margin of 2.00 per month!  LOL!!<br/>\nBut things are good even without help, like I said I know all the <br/>\ntricks to strech a budget without suffering.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Elissa Jill Cleaveland&quot; <br/>\n&lt;MystikMomma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My personal opinion is that in having such a small food budget that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>you aren&#39;t eating more than one meal a day, you are creating an <br/>\nunhealthy pattern.

Eating only","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1802479924\">My husband and I often <br/>\neat only 1 meal a day in order to stay within the budget and we are <br/>\nnot starving<br/>\n*********<br/>\nThis statement jumped out at me. Eating only one meal a day is very unhealthy. It dramatically slows down one&#39;s metabolism, as well as encouraging one to eat more than the stomach is capable of handling. <br/>\nIs there any way to bring in more money? Can you (if you&#39;re not working) get a part time job or go from part time to more hours? Would your son be interested in a paper route to help? I don&#39;t mean &quot;Put him to work&quot; but doing something that would enable him to pick out his own ice cream or juices. There are food stamps and WIC that are there for people who can&#39;t afford an increase in a budget to eat properly.<br/>\nDo you grow your own veggies? A full season of vegetables can be grown right in containers on a balcony or even in a community garden. Picking fruits yourself at the height of the season and canning them is not that huge of a job.  The cost in dollars in miniscule compared to buying them from the store. Heck, even raising your own chickens is MUCH cheaper that purchasing.<br/>\nMy personal opinion is that in having such a small food budget that you aren&#39;t eating more than one meal a day, you are creating an unhealthy pattern.
