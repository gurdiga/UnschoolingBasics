Plan to count birds for at least 15 minutes during<br/>\nFebruary 16Â–19, 2007. You can count each day or just some of the days<br/>\nand you can count in different places. Just be sure to keep a separate<br/>\nlist of birds for each day and each location.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. For each type of bird you see, count the most you see at any one<br/>\ntime. For example, maybe you see two chickadees when you start<br/>\nwatching, then five chickadees a few minutes later. The number you put<br/>\non your list for chickadees is five. Do not add two plus five. (That<br/>\nway you won&#39;t accidentally count the same bird twice.)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Enter your results on the Great Backyard Bird Count web site! Then<br/>\nwatch the maps as more and more people enter their reports.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s it! Now get ready to participate in the Great Backyard Bird<br/>\nCount because when it comes to watching birds, kids count!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21425,"nextTopicId":21421}}
