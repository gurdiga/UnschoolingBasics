Maybe the birds could stay with a friend for awhile until you move.  How are the rest of you coping with that mold? <br/>\nCan you ask for different housing?  When our friend discovered black mold in the basement of his rental he had to provide different accommodations for his renters while the house was being rid of mold. <br/>\nMaybe, you can call your state ombudsman for ideas about getting some help with that.  Maybe there&#39;s someone at the department of health and human services who could direct you to some help.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Hanging a nice big cage...that would be right at face/chest level.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou must be really tall!  How high is your ceiling?  8 feet?   I have a pretty big cage for my Pigeon,  Walter.  It&#39;s not hanging but if I hung it from my ceiling in a corner I could still stand under it.  Still if the idea is to get the cage out of reach of a toddler the cage being at adult face or chest level would accomplish that goal, wouldn&#39;t it?    <br/>\n<br/>\n*** hanging cages is NOT the<br/>\nproper care for birds.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think hanging the cages would be less of a problem than mold.  That mold troubles me.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I&#39;m not going to abuse my birds and make them live in bad<br/>\nconditions just because. And I sure as HELL am not drilling big holes<br/>\nin the ceiling knowing that I&#39;ll be inhaling asbestos fibers.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThat asbestos and mold seem like a big threat so maybe call a friend and arrange for some bird sitting.  Maybe your vet could board them for you for awhile or recommend someone trustworthy to take them for a bit.  <br/>\nThere are probably people in your area who work with the Humane Society and foster animals, maybe you could arrange for foster care for awhile.  <br/>\n <br/>\nCats are especially susceptible to respiratory problems have you talked with your vet about how the mold and might affect the cats and what you can do to protect them?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29808,"nextTopicId":29740}}
