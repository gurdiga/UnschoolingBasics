He is not in need of software as much as he is <br/>\nin need of figuring out a way to get all of his stuff backed up on <br/>\ndisks, which actually is possible. He is a kid with BIG ideas and a <br/>\nused computer is not one of them, his choice.  He would rather work <br/>\nfor the new one that he has been dreaming about for some time so that <br/>\nis fine with me.  Computers aren&#39;t just a casual thing for him, they <br/>\nare his life!!  And he has use of mine so it is not a HUGE deal at the <br/>\nimmediate moment.  He was actually wanting a job long before the <br/>\ncomputer problems so it is not just the computer that is motivating <br/>\nhim to want to get a job.  He has a list wish of several &quot;techy&quot; <br/>\nthings that he wants that add up to around $5,000.  He figures if he <br/>\nworks all year he can check off everything on his list.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20292,"nextTopicId":20325}}
