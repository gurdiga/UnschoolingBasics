The gamecube is a console system (not a handheld game system).<br/>\nThe gameboy is only multi player (usually just two players) if you<br/>\nphysically connect two gameboys together via a cable. The DS uses<br/>\nwireless technology to connect to another DS or even in some<br/>\ncircumstances to the Internet (well, to the Nintendo-Net basically, they<br/>\ncan&#39;t really Surf the web, but they can connect up to other DS systems<br/>\nvia Nintendo). Gameboy games can play on the DS but the functionality<br/>\nand graphics are not the greatest. The BIG difference between the<br/>\ngameboy and the DS is that the DS uses a dual screen setup with one of<br/>\nthe screens being a touch screen (DO get the screen protector sheets);<br/>\nusing a gameboy game on the DS doesn&#39;t utilize that technology. Games<br/>\nfor the DS CANNOT be used on the Gameboy. I believe you can get an<br/>\n&#39;adapter&#39; that allows Gameboy and DS games to be played on the Gamecube<br/>\n(we have a PS2, PS3, two DS systems and 2 Gameboy Advanced SP systems).<br/>\n<br/>\nYES the DS and gameboy are excellent for travel (we got DS his first<br/>\nGameboy specifically for a 3 hour plane trip - he was about 5 at the<br/>\ntime). They all have pretty standard headphone jacks  - I think the<br/>\nGameboy systems might need an adapter (which is pretty easy to come by)<br/>\nto plug a standard headphone into their jack. But any standard<br/>\nheadphones you want to use will work with them (whatever is comfortable<br/>\nfor the kids).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kind of info do you want as far as differences? My suggestion<br/>\n(having BTDT) is to go to a local place like GameStop where you can get<br/>\nUSED handheld systems and actually hold them. I&#39;d get a pair of DS<br/>\nhandhelds (more games available, the older Gameboy systems no longer get<br/>\nnew development), get some spare styluses (styli?), screen protector<br/>\nsheets, and a copy of Pokemon Diamond or Pearl (they can be found used<br/>\nas well). Also, most of the staff at a place like GameStop are gamers in<br/>\ntheir own right and generally very knowledgeable if you go in when it&#39;s<br/>\nnot busy (daytimes during the week are usually good) and just ask<br/>\nquestions and look at things.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
