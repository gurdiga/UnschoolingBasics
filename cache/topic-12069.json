I already had the RU gene in<br/>\nmy system but it was just starting to wake up.  I have major issues with<br/>\nhomework, especially in the early years of school (before high school).  I<br/>\ntold the teachers point blank that I would not be enforcing homework.  That<br/>\nmy children could choose to do homework and if the felt that they wanted to<br/>\ndo it, fine.  If not, then that was fine as well.  I told them quite<br/>\nhonestly that I felt that the majority of homework was unecessary and if<br/>\nthey had my child for 8 hours a day then there was nothing that an<br/>\nadditional hour or two of homework was going to teach them.  If they<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t learn it in 8 hours then they weren&#39;t going to learn it at home in<br/>\n1.  I also said that I didn&#39;t want their lack of homework to impact their<br/>\ngrades.  That if they were passing their tests then obviously they knew the<br/>\ninformation.  If they were not passing their tests, then we would review the<br/>\nneed for additional help in that area.  The kindergarden teacher was fine<br/>\nwith this and said that all homework in kindergarden was optional.  The 2nd<br/>\ngrade and 5th grade teachers agreed to see how things went.  Well, Keon (k)<br/>\nand Emily (5th) had no use for homework and rarely did any of it.  Emily<br/>\nmade it through the first half of the year with all A&#39;s hardly completing or<br/>\nturning in any homework.  Mary Elayne thought homework was fun (she&#39;s an<br/>\nevil child ;)  )  After the first part of the year Emily&#39;s grades dropped<br/>\nsuddenly from A&#39;s to F&#39;s.  In one report card.  I called for a parent<br/>\nteacher conference and the teacher said that the reason she suddenly was<br/>\nfailing was because she wasn&#39;t doing her homework.  She was making 100% on<br/>\nher tests, but because she had daily grades of 0% it caused her to fail.  I<br/>\nreminded him about our agreement at the beginning of the year and his<br/>\nresponse was, &quot;I can&#39;t continue to allow her not to turn in her homework and<br/>\nnot be penalized because other children are jealous that she doesn&#39;t have to<br/>\ndo homework and they do.&quot;  That&#39;s when Emily quit school and decided that<br/>\nshe was going to be in control of her own education.   :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Pampered Chef Michelle","from":"&quot;Pampered Chef Michelle&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] thoughts on choosing ps?","postDate":"1145195195","msgId":12103,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA0MTYwNjQ2czIzYTgxZjhlajdmNTMwODBkMWQyNGM5OTdAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDE2MDE0MzI1Ljg3MzIxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjMxOTEyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDE2MDE0MzI1Ljg3MzIxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjMxOTEyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12101,"nextInTopic":12107,"prevInTime":12102,"nextInTime":12104,"topicId":12069,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I may have<br/>\ntold this recently, but I&#39;ll repeat.  When Emily was 3 she *really* wanted<br/>\nto go to Pre-K.  She BEGGED me to let her go to pre-K.  We couldn&#39;t afford<br/>\nit, but then my mother decided she needed to go to pre-K and paid for it.<br/>\nSo she went.  She hated it.  Why?  Because it didn&#39;t live up to her<br/>\nexpecations.  What she thought would happen at pre-K is that she would get<br/>\nto play in the big playground.  My son was ecstatic when he found out he was<br/>\ngoing to kindergarden.  I wasn&#39;t fond of the idea (my ex and I were living<br/>\nseparated at the time and I hadn&#39;t figured out if I could juggle working and<br/>\nhomeschooling).  I asked him why he wanted to go to school and he said,<br/>\n&quot;Because I get to ride the big bus and eat lunch.&quot;  When my co-parent and I<br/>\ndecided to buy a house together and me quit my formal job, our Mary Elayne<br/>\nsaid she would miss school.  I asked her what part of school she would<br/>\nmiss.  Her reply was, &quot;Seeing Kayla and Dinoje every day.&quot;  None of the<br/>\nreasons that my kids wanted to go to school were about *school.*  I was able<br/>\nto meet their needs just fine though.  The first year after we pulled them<br/>\nout we went and road the city bus and the down town trolley (a fancy bus,<br/>\nnot a street car) several times.  We went to parks to play and I found a<br/>\ngroup of children (Yay Ren) to meet their friend needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere may be something that your daughter is missing that she got at<br/>\nschool.  Your job is to find out what that is and find a way to meet that<br/>\nneed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":30983993,"authorName":"Lesa McMahon-Lowe","from":"&quot;Lesa McMahon-Lowe&quot; &lt;lesajm@...&gt;","profile":"lesamlowe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] thoughts on choosing ps?","postDate":"1145194666","msgId":12101,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTExNS1EQVYxMDlDNjlEQjg4OTFFQUI5RTEzNzkxRDNDNjBAcGh4LmdibD4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDE2MDE0MzI1Ljg3MzIxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjMxOTEyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12069,"nextInTopic":12103,"prevInTime":12100,"nextInTime":12102,"topicId":12069,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I believe you should let her pursue this until she decides that it isn t for\nher.
