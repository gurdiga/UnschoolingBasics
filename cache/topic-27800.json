Buy had I forbade porn and drugs, do you <br/>\nthink he would have felt open talking to me about it?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t actually had the porn issue. Sex, yes, but not porn. <br/>\nMarijuana has also been an issue. But they aren&#39;t fobidden or &quot;not <br/>\nallowed.&quot; *How* could I not allow something when I&#39;m not with him 24/7?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone came running in our house with heroin, would we let them in? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nHuge jump. Let&#39;s start small.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son were smoking weed (I keep saying &quot;pot&quot; or &quot;dope&quot; and keep <br/>\nbeing corrected by my son. They call it weed. &lt;g&gt;), would you make him <br/>\nlive elsewhere?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, rules are guidelines not fences... so I say I don&#39;t want things<br/>\nthat break the law in my house, because those things also hurt people.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes. Sometimes not. Where&#39;s the line?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some laws that can be unjust - so it is a matter of one&#39;s<br/>\nconviction. To me, I don&#39;t want drugs, illegal hacking, porn in my <br/>\nhouse<br/>\nbecause those things can be unsafe.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIllegal doesn&#39;t equal unsafe. Stupidity often does though!<br/>\n<br/>\nAround here, safety is our number ONE concern. I can&#39;t stop my children <br/>\nfrom breaking the law. I can&#39;t. *I* know that, and they know that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can talk about justice and consequences and potential damage. But I <br/>\ncan&#39;t make those decisions *for* them. I want them to be *informed*. If <br/>\nI shut down discussion because it&#39;s something I simply won&#39;t allow, how <br/>\nis that encouraging them to talk with me? How does that keep <br/>\ncommunication open?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s wonderful to think that our fabulous relationships with our kids <br/>\nwill keep them from looking at porn or having sex or doing drugs---but <br/>\nthat&#39;s not always true. What our fabulous relationships DO is to <br/>\nestablish honesty and trust so that they *can* come to us when they <br/>\nhave questions about these things---and to know that, even if they DO <br/>\nthem, they are loved and valued and respected *in spite* of their <br/>\ndecisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron smoked weed and had sex as a young teen (he&#39;s 20 in January). <br/>\nThat didn&#39;t make him wrong or bad or &quot;troubled&quot;---it simply made him <br/>\nCameron. And I am honored to have been included in discussions about <br/>\nthese things before, during, and after the fact. Do I wish he hadn&#39;t so <br/>\nearly? You betcha! But that doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t right for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s responsible and level-headed, and I&#39;ve trusted him to make <br/>\nresponsible, level-headed decisions. Maybe not the one&#39;s *I* would <br/>\nchoose, but I think he&#39;s turned out just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n Is it wrong to have those guidelines in unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIs your &quot;guideline&quot; NO porn and NO drugs?

One thing that s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-306840076\">We&#39;ve been officially unschooling my oldest for almost 2 weeks now.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s really been enjoying his time and exploring things. I&#39;m glad for <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that&#39;s come up is computer time. Initially he stayed up a <br/>\ncouple nights on the computer watching Transformers, etc.  I had issues <br/>\nwith it - (I can see you all shaking your heads ;) ) - because his <br/>\nbrothers would copy it and start hitting each other.  He&#39;d do the same <br/>\ntoo.  I&#39;m all for DS exploring his interests in robots, etc., but I am <br/>\nnot for the coming crying to mom part.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did was explain to DS the patterns of copying, and pointing out <br/>\nthe twins&#39; behavior. I encouraged him to pick something else.  What are <br/>\nother approaches I could have used? All three of them play Transformers <br/>\nwith the toys they have and DS has told me of the difference between <br/>\nBeast Wars and Cybertron, etc. I&#39;ve listened to him though I haven&#39;t <br/>\nasked many questions about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the staying up all night part, I didn&#39;t feel comfortable with him <br/>\nup alone after I had gone to bed. Plus my own time on my computer was <br/>\nlimited because I let him play.  I got behind on emails, etc. So we <br/>\ndiscussed it and I told him that I didn&#39;t feel comfortable with him <br/>\nonline all night. I wouldn&#39;t be able to help him if something happened, <br/>\netc. because I&#39;m asleep. Plus my time runs out and I need to use it - it <br/>\nis my computer after all and brings in income for us too.  So the <br/>\ncomputer reverts to me at 8pm every night until morning.  He can play <br/>\nwith it during the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him if he has his own computer he can decide what his limits are, <br/>\nwithin reason. (I wouldn&#39;t allow porn or breaking the law, etc. in my <br/>\nhouse you know?)  He asked about a laptop. I said we can look into it <br/>\nand at the cost, etc. See what we can work out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo am I missing anything here? Am I being too controlling?<br/>\n--Adrean</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":266096457,"authorName":"Momma","from":"&quot;Momma&quot; &lt;southernbelle@...&gt;","profile":"centurykissed","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Guidance without guilt (crosspost)","postDate":"1195482278","msgId":27820,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyOEYzQTk2NjVEQzRBNEU4MzE2REExMDNBODdBQTFDQE1vbXNQQz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZobzc3aStqY2xnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZobzc3aStqY2xnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27800,"nextInTopic":27828,"prevInTime":27819,"nextInTime":27821,"topicId":27800,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... help my children become respectful if all the work I do modeling and treating them with respect isn t working (my 8-yo. for the most part has gradually","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-679565878\">---I also know that I still get stuck on the word &quot;respect&quot; and how do I<br/>\n  help my children become respectful if all the work I do modeling and<br/>\n  treating them with respect isn&#39;t working (my 8-yo. for the most part<br/>\n  has gradually become a respectful child though she still loses it on<br/>\n  occasion, as do I -lol)?

I would like my children to be courteous to everyone they meet and I try to model that every day but repect is a completely different animal. Respect is like love, it is something you *feel* for someone else. You respect them for a reason. Respect is earned. How can you respect someone you don&#39;t know well, or someone you don&#39;t like for some reason?  Respect can not be forced any more than love can. It is a gradual thing that you begin to feel for someone after knowing them for awhile. If you don&#39;t have respect for someone isn&#39;t there a reason? You can&#39;t expect your daughter to feel the deep respect that you feel for her towards other people, but you can talk to her about courtesy and nice words and others feelings. <br/>\n  AubreyRecent Activity<br/>\n    a..  24New Members<br/>\n  Visit Your Group <br/>\n  Yahoo!

For example,<br/>\nmy 4-yo.(who still nurses and co-sleeps) can give other kids a hard<br/>\ntime, especially if they really want to play with her.  There is this<br/>\none 3-yo. in our homeschool group (still haven&#39;t found any fellow<br/>\nunschoolers in our area, though I&#39;ve posted on several sites) loves<br/>\nour 4-yo.  However, our 4-yo. tells her that she doesn&#39;t want to be<br/>\nfriends with her and hurts the 3-yo.s feelings.  I feel caught in the<br/>\nmiddle of respecting my 4-yo.s wishes of playing with someone else and<br/>\nhelping the 3-yo. feel better and guiding my 4-yo. in how to make and<br/>\nkeep friends.  Also, because we are the only radical unschoolers in<br/>\nthe group, I know the sentiment is to force sharing and playing<br/>\ntogether, etc. and not respect an individual&#39;s needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI told the mother of the 3yo. that I struggle to balance the feelings<br/>\nof others with the needs of my children.  That a 4-yo. isn&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily capable of thinking of how their actions affect others. <br/>\nThey just want their needs met now. I remember once listening to Naomi<br/>\nAldort talk about another mother complaining that one of her son&#39;s<br/>\nwasn&#39;t polite because he wouldn&#39;t read a book to her child.  Naomi<br/>\nsaid that he was just telling her child that he wasn&#39;t interested in<br/>\nreading to him and that that was o.k.  But general society says that<br/>\nthat is rude.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also know that I still get stuck on the word &quot;respect&quot; and how do I<br/>\nhelp my children become respectful if all the work I do modeling and<br/>\ntreating them with respect isn&#39;t working (my 8-yo. for the most part<br/>\nhas gradually become a respectful child though she still loses it on<br/>\noccasion, as do I -lol)?
