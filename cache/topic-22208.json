We have had a lot of &quot;life&quot; happen<br/>\nsince the beginning of 2007 and I find that it is becoming hard to<br/>\nkeep up with &quot;doing academics&quot; each day.<br/>\nI would like to know if there are any other parents that are<br/>\nunschooling their high school child and exactly how you go about<br/>\ndoing it?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is NOT the lazy mom&#39;s way out of making her kid do this <br/>\nschoolwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son, Cameron, left school at the end of 6th grade. Unschooled from <br/>\nthirteen on. He&#39;s 19 now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way we did it was to allow him time to deschool (18 months of not <br/>\ndoing much at all---phone, tv, computer, sleeping). Then he slowly <br/>\nstarted to do little more each day. Now he&#39;s so busy we hardly see him.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I also have a toddler and realize that it&#39;s easier with<br/>\nhim learning at his pace, learning what he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI can guarantee it&#39;s easier to do  that with a teen too!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut with my teen son, I want to make sure that he is getting the proper <br/>\n&quot;education&quot;<br/>\nso that he may have a transcript at the end of 12th grade for me to<br/>\nbe able to give him a high school diploma...<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThen send him to school or keep schooling at home. Seriously. Is that <br/>\nyour *goal*? My goal was that my son would love to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that you *can&#39;t* make a transcript for him. Kathryn Baptista&#39;s son, <br/>\nJulian, has a lovely transcript.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* can make him a diploma! &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s just a piece of paper. I could <br/>\ncalligraphy it for him too! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also like to know how to create a transcript for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you seen high school transcripts? Can you write one?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  He is planning to go to Art School and I know the one he is interested <br/>\nin requires high<br/>\nschool transcript and a diploma. Any help or advice is appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you actually talked with the dean there? Did you ask about <br/>\n&quot;special students?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally homeschooled and older students are looked at separately from <br/>\nthe rest of the herd---because they&#39;re different. They have different <br/>\nbackgrounds. For an art school, I think a portfolio would be MUCH more <br/>\nimportant. Where has he shown his artwork? How many different <br/>\ngalleries? Who has inspired him? How?<br/>\n<br/>\nArt schools in particular want people who think outside the box.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
