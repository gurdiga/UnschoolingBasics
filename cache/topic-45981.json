So I always danced him. We didn&#39;t listen to soft music... It was always quite lively. I even remember dancing to Prince and Gwen Steffani...etc :). He loved the beat and the big dips I&#39;d do with him. He was always asleep before the first song was over. He always asked to go to bed by 7 at night. When he was two, I got too pregnant and had early labor signs with the pregnancy of his brother.  So...the dancing was done :(. Some things that helped him was me asking him what he did that day...even though I knew, the talking helped him. He also loved for me to stick my fingers in his ears and move them. Making that beat noise really settled him. At age 8 he still asks me to do this sometimes.  Experimenting was key for us....and in the end I realized that stimulation was what he needed. When he falls asleep now he still likes to listen to loud music and<br/>\n have a fan blowing right on him full blast.    <br/>\n<br/>\nJeanette<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 25, 2011, at 12:14 AM, &quot;tamara.needham&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tamaraneedham@...\">tamaraneedham@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nI was hoping someone might have some suggestions.. <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if this is the right list for this but I wasn&#39;t sure where else to post.. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Bedtime issue..","postDate":"1295968723","msgId":45985,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlobXBraitjdnNxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlobG03dStmZDVsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45984,"nextInTopic":45986,"prevInTime":45984,"nextInTime":45986,"topicId":45981,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************** Have you tried playing with her instead of trying to stop her?

In order to meet everyone&#39;s needs conventional wisdom just doesn&#39;t seem to work out.  Obviously I can&#39;t see into your home so forgive me if you already do some of these thing but the first thing that comes to mind is (if in fact she is ready to sleep):<br/>\n<br/>\n*creating a bedtime routine.  Maybe hair brushing or story reading or back rubbing or [insert idea here]<br/>\n*dimming the lights and quieting the TV in the evening to promote relaxation<br/>\n*Finding a new comfortable place for you guys to cuddle together<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, if she isn&#39;t ready for sleep can you get up and do something different?  Plan some quiet activities for her in advance.  My kids love to snuggle on the couch and fall asleep, sometimes watching a movie.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSleep needs change, and they can change a lot over the course of a childhood.  My kids are 12,6, and 2 and their sleep patterns vary drastically and even more so between the three of them.  My six year old is the night owl and will stay up until 2am many days.  It can be REALLY challenging trying to meet mine and his needs.  But it&#39;s  helpful for us to not expect sleep, and just try and accommodate his need to be awake longer.  In time we&#39;ve gotten much, much better at this and he&#39;s also become more relaxed at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope there is something in here that helps.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;tamara.needham&quot; &lt;tamaraneedham@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a hard time articulating my thoughts so forgive me if this seems all over the place or doesn&#39;t make sense. <br/>\n&gt; I have a 2 year old DD, and I am also 5 months pregnant.
