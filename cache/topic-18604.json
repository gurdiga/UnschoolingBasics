We pretty much try to avoid them when we can, <br/>\nand will continue probably more so now. <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle,<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree, I wouldn&#39;t hang around her if she wasn&#39;t my sister, so I guess I just have to <br/>\nget it out of my mind that just because she is family that we don&#39;t have to force ourselves <br/>\nto be together or to get along.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb,<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for my poor choice of words, I really hate that word too and understand that her <br/>\nchildren (any children for that matter), should be able to tell an adult when they are being <br/>\nhurt without it being called tattling.  I wish my son would come and tell us, but he tries to <br/>\nhandle it himself by just hitting back.  I was so angry when I posted that it didn&#39;t come <br/>\nacross how i wanted it to.  I think what I was trying to convey was that I have noticed that <br/>\none side effect of punishment, concerning their family, is that whenever her children do <br/>\nanything, whether it be physical or just something slight, then they will go and tell their <br/>\nmom or dad because then that person that they told will be punished.  Furthermore the <br/>\nchild that told will tease the child that is being punished by saying &quot;you have to go to <br/>\ntime-out, ha ha, ha ha ha&quot;.  It&#39;s just an all around negative family situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe last few times we have gotten together my dh and I have tried to be there 100% <br/>\ninteracting with the kids and trying to diffuse any situation that may come up.  Thanks for <br/>\nyour suggestions concerning what else to do.  I guess the limited time we are around them <br/>\nwe will do like you said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ***my son hits or kicks back they come and tattle<br/>\n&gt; on him,***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Her kids shouldn&#39;t be hit either and children should be able to tell an <br/>\n&gt; adult when they&#39;re being hurt without it being called &quot;tattling.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I understand your frustration about what is happening but I strongly dislike <br/>\n&gt; that word.

Stop conflicts before they escalate.  Tell the <br/>\nchildren directly that while you love them, you won&#39;t let them hurt or be <br/>\nmean to your kid.   If you notice tension see if changing the play will <br/>\nhelp.  Offer to go outside and play ball with them or some other physical <br/>\nthing.  Offer food, maybe have snacks with you, enough for all the kids, so <br/>\nthat if hunger or low energy is the problem it can be bypassed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they hurt or are mean to your kid, remove yourselves from the situation. <br/>\nDon&#39;t make it seem like a punishment to your kid.  If you leave the play <br/>\ndate, take him somewhere *more* fun.  Go to a movie, go get ice cream, go <br/>\nride your bikes together, do something he really loves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are with or very near them when they&#39;re playing and if you&#39;re paying <br/>\nattention, you may be able to understand how the meanness starts and what to <br/>\ndo to stop it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf her kids feel bullied (as it sounds) they will bully.  You might not be <br/>\nable to stop it completely but you may be able to improve the situation <br/>\nenough that it&#39;s positive for your son.<br/>\n<br/>\nOffer your son many other fun things to do and places to go so that his <br/>\ncousins don&#39;t seem like his best choice and he may choose the other fun <br/>\nthings over visits with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18596,"nextTopicId":18637}}
