We used those books when I was learning Greek in graduate <br/>\nschool and they&#39;re really nice.  The premise is that you learn to <br/>\nread Greek by doing translations of simplified texts, not by <br/>\nmemorizing verbs and declensions and grammar.  So you translate small <br/>\npassages (with helpful vocabulary provided) and then for each <br/>\ntranslation passage you have associated grammar in the other book.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSince there&#39;s no real reason to speak classic Greek, this method is <br/>\nexcellent for learning how to read Greek.  It seems to me that it <br/>\nwould be even better for a self-learner, since translating the <br/>\npassages of text provides so much more pleasure than the other <br/>\nmethods of learning a language.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":251347310,"authorName":"lin.an@gmx.at","from":"lin.an@...","profile":"lin_an","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Rosetta Stone or ?","postDate":"1215506564","msgId":34414,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDgwNzA4MDg0MjQ0LjI1OTEwQGdteC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWUMxLVBBU01UUDA3MDQ1QzlDNkZDNDlBOERFNkIxMDlENzk3MEBDRVouSUNFPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc0dTg2Yyt0NnJnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QkFZQzEtUEFTTVRQMDcwNDVDOUM2RkM0OUE4REU2QjEwOUQ3OTcwQENFWi5JQ0U+"},"prevInTopic":34409,"nextInTopic":34419,"prevInTime":34413,"nextInTime":34415,"topicId":34406,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I just remembered listening to some language clips on youtube before.
