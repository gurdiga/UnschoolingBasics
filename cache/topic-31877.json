Linnaea has had two Kung Fu classes and Simon had his first last night. They are interested, engaged and attentive. Simon is amazingly focused. It was  fascinating to watch him in comparison with the couple of other kids in the class. He listened to direction, practiced what the instructor was saying as he waited his turn. He spoke up and asked for a bit of clarifying if he needed it. He was interested. If he&#39;d been taking classes all of his life and this was just another one, I don&#39;t think he would be as confident or as engaged as he is. Linnaea is a little less interested in Kung Fu than is Simon, she is doing it for the fun of the movement and is much less concerned with picking up the specifics. If he was doing this to demonstrate to others something, maybe to pad out his college application, or to deal with bullies, I don&#39;t think that his excitement would be so obvious, his joy so great. If<br/>\n he was doing this for me or for David there would be none of the passion that he is showing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you can prepare someone for the misery that would come from being orphaned as a child. I don&#39;t think being inoculated with school experience would help them to buffer against those emotional storms. I think the OP is absolutely right that it is better to line their lives with glorious memories of connection and love and kindness than to make sure that if the worst happens they are prepared. You can&#39;t be prepared, you have to wing it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n============<br/>\n~~She was concerned that my kids would then have to go to<br/>\nschool and that it would be hard for them to adjust when they have<br/>\nnever had any school-type experiences.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a myth.<br/>\nIf something happened to you then your kids are going to have a hard<br/>\ntime period! <br/>\n<br/>\nMy always unschooled nephew decided to go to high school.
