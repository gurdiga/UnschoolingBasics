I liked school(or should I say education) I<br/>\n&gt; loved <br/>\n&gt; homeschooling a million times more, working at my<br/>\n&gt; own pace etc. My <br/>\n&gt; mom told me I would grow up and be a doctor. I even<br/>\n&gt; went to college <br/>\n&gt; majoring in pre-med and dropped out because I only<br/>\n&gt; want to be a mom <br/>\n&gt; have lots of kids and stay at home. I am organized<br/>\n&gt; self-motivated and <br/>\n&gt; completely lost.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My oldest daughter Kirsten went to public school in<br/>\n&gt; Kindergarten. We <br/>\n&gt; were told by her teacher the first week she was slow<br/>\n&gt; and needed <br/>\n&gt; special classes for speech. We had her tested and<br/>\n&gt; not only did she <br/>\n&gt; NOT need any special help she tested several grades<br/>\n&gt; above in <br/>\n&gt; comprehension with understanding topics of<br/>\n&gt; conversation well above <br/>\n&gt; her years. Despite this, her evaluations showed her<br/>\n&gt; behind the class <br/>\n&gt; in reading, phonetics the whole year. By her first<br/>\n&gt; grade year, third <br/>\n&gt; week I had enough of the next teacher and pulled her<br/>\n&gt; out of PS to <br/>\n&gt; teach her myself. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I first did nothing with her for a month. Then<br/>\n&gt; apparently I made a <br/>\n&gt; mistake and start her with book learning, from<br/>\n&gt; lifepacs to the well <br/>\n&gt; trained mind, rod and staff, I tried a lot including<br/>\n&gt; unit studies as <br/>\n&gt; well. She bucked me the whole time. She hates her<br/>\n&gt; schoolwork, hates <br/>\n&gt; learning the stuff I am trying to cram down her<br/>\n&gt; throat despite the <br/>\n&gt; idea that everybody has to learn this. She is not<br/>\n&gt; like me but very <br/>\n&gt; much like her dad who hated schoolwork too. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then the other day she forgot something and I said<br/>\n&gt; to her that she <br/>\n&gt; was younger than me and should be able to remember<br/>\n&gt; things better than <br/>\n&gt; me.

She checks<br/>\n&gt; out a good amount <br/>\n&gt; of non-fiction as well as fiction and loves to read.<br/>\n&gt; I think there is <br/>\n&gt; where I will start and just leave her to do her own<br/>\n&gt; thing right now. <br/>\n&gt; She also loves weather related phenomena and<br/>\n&gt; twisters, tornados.

We cloth diaper the<br/>\n&gt; rabbits and <br/>\n&gt; guinea pigs. Which is another fun topic that<br/>\n&gt; completely astounds <br/>\n&gt; people. No they don&#39;t wear the cloth diapers. The<br/>\n&gt; prefolds line the <br/>\n&gt; bottom of their litter pans which then is covered<br/>\n&gt; with timothy hay. <br/>\n&gt; All three rabbits and guinea pigs have habitats I<br/>\n&gt; built from organize <br/>\n&gt; its from target and coroplast from a local plant.<br/>\n&gt; You can see the <br/>\n&gt; ideas from cavycages.com.
