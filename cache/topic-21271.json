I just <br/>\nread a journal article about this...people with OCD or depresssion use the orbital frontal <br/>\ncortex overly much, and medication will allow them to use different circuits. The use of <br/>\npurely emotional portions of the brain leave them unable to use the logic circuits as most <br/>\npeople do, to be able to think of a route out of depression, or past washing their hands for <br/>\nthe 200th time.
