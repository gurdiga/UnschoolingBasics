What about college?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can understand the difficulty in strewing for the 10y/o set.  I have a 10<br/>\ny/o boy.  I leave odd things around that he might like.  Dollar store silly<br/>\nputty in different colors (which always ends up mixed up into one big ball<br/>\nof brown within a few days), magazines that he may or may not find<br/>\ninteresting, sometimes they just sit there, other times he picks them up for<br/>\na few seconds.  When we go to the library, he doesn&#39;t always want to go with<br/>\nme, but when he does he spends his time on the computers, so I look for<br/>\nbooks that may interest him and sit them around.  Typically they&#39;re magna<br/>\nbooks, or books about video games.  Sometimes it&#39;s new foods that find their<br/>\nway to the fridge, other times it&#39;s favorite foods that I pick up to make<br/>\nhim happy.  He&#39;s always on the lookout for new little things now.  Another<br/>\nsomewhat strewing idea that I&#39;ve done is hiding little notes (short quick I<br/>\nlove you&#39;s or good luck beating that next level) in his video game cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for playing video games all day, my son plays them for probably 95% of<br/>\nhis waking hours.  The rest of the time he&#39;s either out playing football<br/>\nwith the apartment complex kids, or he&#39;s making detailed battles with his<br/>\nlego figures and action figures.  At first my partner and I had a HUGE<br/>\nproblem with the amount of time spent on video games.  Now I&#39;ve started<br/>\n&quot;looking for the learning&quot; without saying anything to him (which is a big<br/>\npart of it, the not saying anything part).  Do your kids look up cheat codes<br/>\nand walkthroughs for their games?  That&#39;s research and reading, and learning<br/>\nhow to search for relevant information.  Do they play online with friends?<br/>\n That&#39;s socialization and learning to interact with people of all ages, also<br/>\nnetworking (an important skill typically learned later in life while job<br/>\nhunting).  Do they use walkthrough books and cheat code books?  That&#39;s again<br/>\nreading, and typically learning how to use a table of contents and index.<br/>\n Another thing that recently dawned on me, when I started playing the video<br/>\ngames too (Assassins Creed 2 is my current favorite) is that it takes hand<br/>\nstrength and endurance to play those games, that will make it easier for<br/>\nneater handwriting when he decides it&#39;s time to write neater (if he ever<br/>\ndoes).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso you&#39;ll be amazed at the things that they learn from video games when it<br/>\ncomes to history, strategy, and with some games, even foreign languages.<br/>\n We&#39;ve all been taking turns playing Assassin&#39;s Creed 2 lately, and<br/>\nsometimes the characters speak in italian.  Well I had a hard time hearing<br/>\neverything they said so I turned on the subtitles, and we realized the<br/>\nsubtitles translate most of the Italian for us too!  What a great benefit,<br/>\nhe&#39;s now interested in getting an Italian language program to try.  Oh,<br/>\nanother skill in most of these games is map reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot of reading in these games, if you sit and watch you&#39;ll<br/>\nprobably see more than you realized.  As for writing, do they type?  In all<br/>\nreality, in todays world, handwriting isn&#39;t that important of a skill, for<br/>\nthat matter spelling really isn&#39;t either I communicate mostly through email<br/>\n(when not talking face to face), and thank goodness for spell check, I&#39;ve<br/>\nused it about 20 times just in this letter.  When I do need to write a<br/>\nletter to someone I always type it up and print it out.  Even when I was in<br/>\ncollege I never hand wrote my first draft, unless I had to write something<br/>\nin class, and then my handwriting was horrible, and I had all of the years<br/>\nof compulsory schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nOccasionally he asks (even at 10) about college and stuff.  He asks what<br/>\nthings he&#39;ll need to know for college and we discuss it.  Typically that<br/>\nleads to a day or two of him asking for math work (which he picks up<br/>\namazingly quickly since he&#39;s interested) or asking for help with learning<br/>\nhow to sign his name in cursive.  Then he forgets about it and goes back to<br/>\nnon-stop video games.  I&#39;m really not worried about it because when you<br/>\nstart junior college (which he&#39;ll be able to start early if he wants to)<br/>\nthey test you and he can take the non-credit classes until he&#39;s caught up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to cleaning up, that&#39;s still a sticky point around here<br/>\nsometimes, but it&#39;s getting loads better.  I just woke up (we&#39;re night time<br/>\npeople here) and my kitchen, which was clean before I went to bed, is<br/>\ncovered in dishes.  However, instead of being upset about this, I&#39;m happy<br/>\nthat the dishes made it to the kitchen.  I&#39;m excited that he found and made<br/>\nhimself food (a skill many adult males don&#39;t even have), and I also noticed<br/>\nthat the dishwasher has been run, probably by him, and since it was full,<br/>\nthat&#39;s why the rest of the dishes weren&#39;t done.  Even these little things<br/>\ndidn&#39;t happen overnight.  When we first started radically unschooling (a<br/>\nyear or so ago) he refused to do a single &quot;chore&quot; type activity, and he only<br/>\nhelped when asked.  Now I notice lots of little spontaneous things.  Because<br/>\nI ask him if he&#39;d like something to eat or drink whenever I head towards the<br/>\nkitchen, he now asks my partner and I.  Last night he even cooked us all<br/>\nburritos in the toaster oven, and then brought them to us.  As for the mess<br/>\nin the kitchen right now, well I personally don&#39;t feel like tackling it this<br/>\nvery moment, so I&#39;m not, but in a few hours when everyone is awake I&#39;ll ask<br/>\nif anyone minds helping, and typically they don&#39;t mind, and in 10-15 minutes<br/>\nmy kitchen will be clean.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is a long email, sorry for that, but a year or so ago I was in<br/>\nthe same place you are, and I remember how scary that was.  Believe me, it<br/>\ndoes get better, and better, and better.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: I have no idea what I am doing","postDate":"1292859115","msgId":45717,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGllbnN0YitodTA5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrVU9Va2FlNE1hbTJlUl9CWEZjMDRYMzBXVTRDQ2VRenlNUDdfWkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":45711,"nextInTopic":45727,"prevInTime":45716,"nextInTime":45718,"topicId":45682,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Your kids need a break from the pressures of &quot;education&quot; either at school or home, to learn to be themselves again. Its pretty normal for kids, especially teens, to do a lot of vegging out for awhile, and depending on how much time each person needs, you that while can be over a year! Think of the, if you like, as on sabatical for mental health reasons. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; P.S.- The only reason I have not given up and sent them all packing back to school is the fact we are all truly- the happiest people we ever have been. I know that indicates something....<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nTa Da! See, it works ;) Happiness is a good thing - some people hunt for it all their lives, you know. Your kids are now ahead of the game in that regard. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now, what do they want? Do they just want to hang out for awhile? Its okay if they do, but maybe plan some fun things to do with each kid as well as together as a family. I mean Fun things, not educational-and-fun things. What do they like? Music? Go out and see some bands. Fashion? Look for local, small scale fashion shows - ask at make-up counters in malls, local art galleries and tattoo shops if you don&#39;t know where to start with that. Small scale fashion is a fascinating, grass-rootsy scene. The hardest part of strewing for kids who&#39;ve been in school or homeschooled for many years is they&#39;ve lost the ability to get excited about new things And they struggle to think outside the box. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Is it really okay for them to be playing video games ALL DAY?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.

I am new to the group and have been reading for a few weeks and I must say- I just *thought* I didn&#39;t know what I was doing...you all have confirmed it. I was really confused in the beginning, with reading all of the food posts...I was like...woah-what is this? I was confused and began to radically question everything I thought I knew. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast year we decided to homeschool the kids. I quit my lucrative job and became a SAHM. My eldest is/was in college and I had three kids left at home who I felt desperately needed me. My son is now 16 and in school- he hated everything. He didn&#39;t do his schoolwork and it was a constant battle. My other two are girls, now almost 10 and 13 and they too hated school and was always having to stay late for detention or finishing work. Then there was the lying about homework and general misbehaving about having to get up every morning (and go to bed at night!). The youngest was also caught up in her and others appearances and only went to school for the fashion show. I didn&#39;t like who they were becoming nor who I was as a parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we kept them home last year and I bought a curriculum and had them scheduled for every minute of the day. It was torture. They all wanted to go back to school. Fast forward to the beginning of this school year, I asked them all what curriculum they would like to try and do, I gave them the choice. We bought it and...they still hated it. They (the girls especially) still wanted to go back to school. I said, that&#39;s not true...if you really wanted to sit in a classroom all day and work...and then spend your evenings doing homework...you could be doing that right now...at home!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I gave up. Literally. I just let them do what they wanted to do. I felt like a miserable failure. Then, I began to find articles on the internet about this unschooling. I got a general idea what it was about but no real specifics. Then I found radical unschooling...and I became terrified. I have absolutely no idea exactly what I am doing. I &quot;just&quot; learned about &quot;strewing&quot;...what on earth do you strew for teenagers? If they have a specific desire I try to always say yes...but they are very few and far between. Here is my main fears: Is it really okay for them to be playing video games ALL DAY? How do I get them to pick up their mess without becoming a monster or am I a slave to them all day? How on earth will my 10 year old become a productive member of society if she can barely read and write? What about college?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is a lot of questions but, no matter what I read, these things really are not specifically addressed. I just don&#39;t want to damage my kids any further. I read about all of these fabulous unschoolers and how they became brilliant and went to college and became successful people and it just does not equate for me. I see my kids in pajamas at three o&#39;clock in the afternoon with their eyes glazed over from playing &quot;Call of Duty&quot; all day and try to imagine them as successful adults and it won&#39;t compute. Help!<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.- The only reason I have not given up and sent them all packing back to school is the fact we are all truly- the happiest people we ever have been.
