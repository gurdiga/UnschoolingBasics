It is not whether you buy a certain<br/>\nbrand or even a certain type of item. It is the over all sense of<br/>\nwanting and feeling that we need all this stuff that we don&#39;t need.<br/>\n**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I&#39;ve found most helpful in this regard has been to <br/>\nreframe the concept of &quot;anti-consumerism&quot; in a more positive form. <br/>\nConeptually, this is related to the unschooling concept of &quot;living <br/>\nby principles&quot; so here&#39;s a link to a sort of &quot;primer&quot; on that <br/>\nconcept:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/rules\">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFrom an unschooling standpoint, the question isn&#39;t so much &quot;how do I <br/>\ntalk about consumerism (so my kids understand its wrong)&quot; its more a <br/>\nmatter of &quot;how do I promote a sense of abundance and fulfillment <br/>\nwithin my family?&quot;<br/>\n**********************<br/>\n When she forgets about tv for a few weeks she<br/>\nreally doesn&#39;t think about more stuff.... But the cycle starts all <br/>\nover again if we have a<br/>\nrainy week and the tv is on a lot.<br/>\n***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be useful to think about why she may be watching more tv <br/>\nsometimes and how those other factors may *also* be contributing to <br/>\na sense of lack or dissatisfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child stuck inside during a spate of bad weather (to use the above <br/>\nexample) may not be as happy as she is at other times. From one <br/>\nperspective, her options are limited, so she&#39;s seeking to expand <br/>\nthem. What she sees on tv is providing her with possibilites.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a parent, then, it may be worth look into having other options <br/>\navailable for those sorts of situations. Build a collection of <br/>\nprojects and supplies and games to spark some excitement on a dull <br/>\nday, or those times when everyone in the family seems to be in a <br/>\nrut. Y&#39;all know about &quot;strewing&quot; don&#39;t you? <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/museum\">http://sandradodd.com/museum</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strewing\">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIts also worth considering what mom&#39;s doing when the tv is on, <br/>\nespecially if its on longer than usual. This isn&#39;t meant to be <br/>\naccusatory, but as someone (I suspect Paul) commented, tv *can* make <br/>\nit easier to wander off and do our own thing...pay bills, clean the <br/>\nfridge, surf the net ;) Things that aren&#39;t always terribly appealing <br/>\nto the our kids. Personally, whenever it seems as though Mo has been <br/>\nwatching more tv than usual, I do a little self-check to see if I&#39;m <br/>\ncontributing by being...well, boring! If I&#39;m not &quot;filling Mo&#39;s cup&quot; <br/>\nas it were, she&#39;s going to look somewhere else for fulfillment. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s another thought - reframing the questions we ask ourselves <br/>\nhelps shift the focus of our attention. If the question is about <br/>\nconsumerism, I&#39;m thinking about the world at large, pollution, <br/>\npolitics, global warming, etc. If the question is about abundance <br/>\nwithin my family, I&#39;m thinking about what *I* can do to help the <br/>\npeople I love get more out of life Right Now. That&#39;s not to say <br/>\nthinking about changing the world is somehow wrongheaded, but it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t necessarily improve my relationship with my kid Today. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25401,"nextTopicId":25325}}
