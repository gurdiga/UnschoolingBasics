When you&#39;re dating someone, you don&#39;t try to guide or teach them. You drink deeply of whatever moves, inspires, empassions them.

You listen and enjoy with them (even if you don&#39;t particularly like Beethoven, you can enjoy their enjoyment), you might keep an eye out for local concerts, new CDs (maybe the Boston Pops just released a Beethoven performance), and so on.

That&#39;s definitely one for me to work on. I feel like although I don&#39;t say anything to my son about what he&#39;s doing progression wise, I am constantly on the lookout for things he&#39;s picked up. Like when he reads something that I didn&#39;t know he knew I make a big deal about it. Or if he&#39;s interested in something like animals or gorillas (his latest thing), I guess I assign value to those things based on how he could learn something from them. Another thing I&#39;m guilty of that I would like to change is that if he shows the slightest interest in something new, I want to look it up on the Internet, got to the library, make a field trip related to it, or whatever hits me as being educational. I guess the thing is I still sort of think of myself as his teacher so I feel like I&#39;m letting him down or stunting his learning if I don&#39;t step in somehow. <br/>\n      Anyway, thanks for your post, it was very enlightening.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Debra Rossing &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Next time you get those &quot;twinges&quot;, instead of sitting the kids down to bookwork, sit yourself down with a notepad and pen and jot down all the things the kids have been doing over the last few days. EVERYTHING - what TV programs/DVDs did they watch? What toys did they play with? What pretend play story lines are they playing out? Did you run around the yard chasing butterflies? Did they scooch down to watch wee tiny bugs on the dandelions? And so on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then sort it or categorize it - many folks do this anyhow because they have to do year-end reports to comply with state laws. Really think about what was involved - most things in life fit in a bunch of categories at once. Baking cookies (because it&#39;s baking cookie season NOT as a lesson, as you&#39;ve already noticed they&#39;re gun shy about &#39;school lessons&#39;) includes reading, arithmetic (measurement, time, counting), following instructions, nutrition, science (try leaving the flour out of the chocolate chip cookies sometime or leave out the baking powder). Might also include grocery shopping (more arithmetic, nutrition, maybe other stuff). It might also include history and geography (is it a recipe handed down from great-grandma who was born in Germany?) It might include auditory learning (listening to you tell stories about when you made these cookies with your mom). It might include community service if you bring some to a neighbor. It might include art if they&#39;re decorated sugar cookies (what happens if they put both the red and green sugar on the same cookie? what about the yellow and red sugar? What if they mix food coloring for different color glazes?) That&#39;s a BIG chunk of &quot;subjects&quot; but they don&#39;t lay themselves all out in neat little boxes all labeled and time boxed as they do when you&#39;ve got &quot;math lessons time&quot; and &quot;reading time&quot; and so on. Which is why it can help when you&#39;re getting started to write it out and learn to SEE the learning going on. After a time, you won&#39;t need to do that (unless, again, it&#39;s needed for legal reporting) because you&#39;ll have deschooled your own self and learned to trust the learning that is happening. It&#39;s a lot like a garden - you put the seeds in the ground; you water, maybe weed a bit, hope there&#39;s not a freak spring snowstorm, and you wait. All the initial growth is invisible to you - trying to check on it involves basically killing that growth by pulling up the plant to check the roots. And then lo and behold out springs a wee green sprout. You can water, weed, wait some more or you can root up that sprout to check the growth - and again, kill it in the process. You have to trust that growth is happening and that in some weeks from now you&#39;ll have some yummy produce. And when that produce arrives, how exciting is that! Because you simply watered, weeded, maybe added compost, and waited and the growth happened (maybe even in spite of you!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Deb R<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **********************************************************************<br/>\n&gt; This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\n&gt; intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\n&gt; are addressed.

For some kids, it&#39;s better to avoid anything that might be construed (by the child) as &quot;educational&quot; for awhile - reading, trips to the zoo or museums, even card and board games.

Now, he chalks each failure up to the learning process and goes on, excited about what he&#39;s doing even when it&#39;s hard and tedious and fraught with challenges.

There will be advice here that will  <br/>\nmake some people uncomfortable that is what someone else needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly, here, the advice leans towards very bluntly stated ideas.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s the flavor of this particular list. Other lists have other  <br/>\nflavors. If someone prefers Wendy&#39;s hamburgers they shouldn&#39;t expect  <br/>\nMcDonalds to adjust to their preferences.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t really believe that it takes us back to the beginning  <br/>\n&gt; because we do learn from those moments--and if we are humble about  <br/>\n&gt; it, our kids will learn something too.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some people don&#39;t see the bad effects (in a timely fashion) though.  <br/>\nFor some people the school ways are so tied up with what&#39;s right in  <br/>\ntheir minds that they can&#39;t get that big rock out that&#39;s blocking  <br/>\ntheir vision.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beauty of unschooling is the fact that, in a rich supportive  <br/>\nenvironment, kids will learn what they need in their own time. *BUT*  <br/>\nthat process doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll learn something when someone else  <br/>\nneeds them to learn it. (Which is why we steer the kids away from  <br/>\ndemands they don&#39;t want to tackle yet.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat learning process works for adults too, but adults often have  <br/>\nbaggage that gets in the way of them grasping certain ideas. (Most  <br/>\nkids can shed it in a few months through deschooling.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor moms figuring out unschooling, though, they can&#39;t put their kids  <br/>\non hold while the moms figure out unschooling at a natural pace. A 10  <br/>\nyo child doesn&#39;t have 5 or 10 years for a mom to have an epiphany  <br/>\nabout where her baggage is getting in her own way of figuring out  <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a huge amount to figure out to make unschooling run smoothly.  <br/>\nA lot of it *can* be learned baby steps at a time. But there are some  <br/>\nreally big ideas that need to be grasped Right Now for unschooling to  <br/>\neven begin. One of those is that reviving school while a child is  <br/>\nrecovering from school is going to be damaging to that recovery, just  <br/>\nas straining a torn muscle before it&#39;s healed will tear it again. Will  <br/>\nit set every child back to the beginning? No, of course not. (Depends  <br/>\nhow far along they are in healing. Depends on personality. Depends on  <br/>\nhow damaged they are and in what ways.) But deschooling will go much  <br/>\nsmoother if every deschooling parent behaved as if it would reset  <br/>\ntheir kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nLetting go of the baggage blocking understanding unschooling is  <br/>\n*hard*. The baggage is comforting. New ideas that we haven&#39;t built a  <br/>\nlifetime of confidence in are scary.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to get unschooling running smoothly -- before the kids leave home  <br/>\n-- moms need to embrace a crapload of discomfort as part of the  <br/>\nprocess. Every time mom takes a step backward into their comfort zone  <br/>\nthey hamper themselves *and* their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is the comfort zone is comforting! The &quot;reseting the  <br/>\nclock&quot; idea is intended to make the comfort zone look less comforting  <br/>\nto help people who want to make progress, who don&#39;t want to step  <br/>\nbackwards, to not make that choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you&#39;ve gotten the point I was trying to make, but I like  <br/>\nanalogies ;-) If you&#39;re dropped into a foreign country without knowing  <br/>\nthe language, to get on with life you need to learn some of the  <br/>\nlanguage. The more you learn, the better the quality of your life. If  <br/>\nthere&#39;s a group of English speakers, spending time with them would be  <br/>\na relief from the discomfort of hurdling the language barrier for even  <br/>\nthe simplest day to day thing. *If* someone used the group as respite  <br/>\nto recharge, that would be a good thing. But we humans (all animals  <br/>\nreally) are  ... not seekers of comfort (otherwise we&#39;d never leave  <br/>\nhome or climb Mt. Everest ;-) ... but we don&#39;t want the discomfort to  <br/>\nbe more than the benefits of what we&#39;re trying to do. We don&#39;t want  <br/>\nthe trials of a trip up Mt. Everest  to get to the grocery store ;-)  <br/>\nWe want the payoff to match the discomfort. And until someone fully  <br/>\ngets the payoff of unschooling or learning a language -- that may be  <br/>\n*years* away -- the day to day discomfort is daunting and makes them  <br/>\nretreat to their comfort zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether it&#39;s getting a decent meal in a land where you can&#39;t speak the  <br/>\nlanguage or getting the kids to learn math, the discomfort of the new  <br/>\nways seems excessive for what you want. It&#39;d be much easier for the  <br/>\nkids to do a page of math than to spend weeks and months feeling  <br/>\nuncomfortable while the kids play video games and you wait for  <br/>\n&quot;unschooling math&quot; to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like climbing the hurdles of a language barrier in Japan to seek  <br/>\nmom&#39;s pot roast in Japanese restaurants ;-) You&#39;ll be much happier if  <br/>\nyou seek a Japanese meals that you like.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unschooling, you not only have to learn a new way of supporting  <br/>\nkids (the new language) but you&#39;re looking for something entirely new  <br/>\n(the delights of a totally different cuisine.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In learning a completely new paradigm we are all bound to act and  <br/>\n&gt; think in the old way from time to time, and I think it&#39;s important  <br/>\n&gt; to notice that we did so, and to give ourselves grace and space to  <br/>\n&gt; learn and fail and experiment(like we are trying to give our kids!),  <br/>\n&gt; and then to just get back on the horse, so to speak.

Yes, I know it is a setback when we coerce or act in our old schoolish ways, but it is also a learning experience. I think the clock analogy could be a helpful warning for us to recognize that no, we don&#39;t want to move backwards, but I think it could be unhelpful for those of us who may beat ourselves up over our mistakes or backwards steps.

Writing a song with lyrics - that&#39;s HUGE! That&#39;s poetry, handwriting, spelling, music, and math right there (music is very mathematical - just ask any of the classical composers - oh wait they&#39;re mostly de-composing by now LOL!) It just doesn&#39;t look all divided up and schoolish. He may NEVER pick up a textbook - so what? There&#39;s more history all around in the real world than any textbook. My DS has instigated more &quot;history&quot; discussions because of TV and movies than any textbook would get into. If there&#39;s something that catches his attention, he asks. The big Caveat to when kids start asking questions is that us grown-ups don&#39;t turn it into a &quot;lesson&quot;. Answer first with the shortest possible answer and wait to see if more information is requested (verbally or non-verbally) before running on at the mouth. If you don&#39;t know, say so and go look it up YOURSELF - and invite the kids along with you (and it&#39;s okay if they say No, I&#39;ll wait for you to check it out). Consider it like a friend - if a friend who knows you love history calls you and asks a question that you don&#39;t know the answer to right off, do you say &quot;go look it up yourself&quot; or do you say &quot;I don&#39;t know off hand but I know right where to look for it - call you back in 5 minutes&quot;. Treat your kids the same way. If they&#39;re interested, show them how you find the information. If they&#39;re only interested in the information, not the process, that&#39;s fine too.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

There are big, old cultural expectations that learning is hard and unpleasant - both &quot;is&quot; and &quot;should be&quot; hard and unpleasant. Those ideas tie into a lot of other biases and discrimination, too - discrimination against women in general and moms in particular, but also against joyfulness in a general sense, as though &quot;most men live lives of quiet desperation&quot; were some kind of recipe for adulthood, not a lament. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Absolutely happier&quot; is big. It&#39;s vastly big and important. His Whole Life is better if he&#39;s happier. <br/>\n<br/>\nHuman beings are wired to learn, driven to learn - so learning Feels Good to us. It&#39;s self-rewarding if you like. We like learning so much that we call times of not-learning &quot;tedium&quot; and we strive to avoid that. So happiness in and of itself is a good sign that some learning is happening. The catch, from a deschooling point of view, is that real learning doesn&#39;t look like school learning. It looks like living life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help to take some time and think about what learning Is - what it&#39;s for and how it works in real life, adult life. Some learning involves taking in bits of information or gaining new skills, but most  of the time learning doesn&#39;t look like either of those things, it&#39;s both subtle and going on all the time. Sandra has collected so many essays and comments on the subject of what learning is and looks like that I&#39;m going to bombard you with links for a moment ;) When you start thinking about &quot;nudging&quot; your kid, go read some of them. Follow down the extra links and read more. Go back and read things you read months ago and see if they make more (or different!) sense the next time - You&#39;re learning too. That&#39;s part of what makes deschooling hard, You&#39;re on the big uphill sweep of the learning curve and maybe can&#39;t even see the &quot;top&quot; yet:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/puddle\">http://sandradodd.com/puddle</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/connections/\">http://sandradodd.com/connections/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/nest\">http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/howto/\">http://sandradodd.com/howto/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/substance\">http://sandradodd.com/substance</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/typical\">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThat last, the &quot;Typical days&quot; are really more like &quot;the kinds of days which stand out for one reason or another&quot; - don&#39;t think your life has to look like that all the time. What&#39;s good about those stories, though, is they&#39;re great snapshots of moments when parents realize &quot;aha! this unschooling thing is Really Working!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a great quote on the &quot;substance&quot; page:<br/>\n&quot;We have a compost pile, and it&#39;s kind of amazing how it seems at first that the food and leaves and sticks and banana peels and dog poop will never do anything but sit there looking like garbage, but when I stop watching it, it turns to solid black, rich dirt! I can&#39;t find any parts of the elements of which it&#39;s made. It&#39;s kind of like that with my kids. It took me a few years to quit watching them and trust that it would compost.&quot;---Sandra Dodd<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Deschooling sucks","postDate":"1320952511","msgId":47640,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU1ODUzQTdCLTUzREMtNDA2My04QUYwLUUwNjI4RkQ3NzhGNkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo5aDIwcitzNXQxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo5aDIwcitzNXQxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47639,"nextInTopic":47642,"prevInTime":47639,"nextInTime":47641,"topicId":47634,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Did they scooch down to watch wee tiny bugs on the dandelions? And so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen sort it or categorize it - many folks do this anyhow because they have to do year-end reports to comply with state laws. Really think about what was involved - most things in life fit in a bunch of categories at once. Baking cookies (because it&#39;s baking cookie season NOT as a lesson, as you&#39;ve already noticed they&#39;re gun shy about &#39;school lessons&#39;) includes reading, arithmetic (measurement, time, counting), following instructions, nutrition, science (try leaving the flour out of the chocolate chip cookies sometime or leave out the baking powder). Might also include grocery shopping (more arithmetic, nutrition, maybe other stuff). It might also include history and geography (is it a recipe handed down from great-grandma who was born in Germany?) It might include auditory learning (listening to you tell stories about when you made these cookies with your mom). It might include community service if you bring some to a neighbor. It might include art if they&#39;re decorated sugar cookies (what happens if they put both the red and green sugar on the same cookie? what about the yellow and red sugar? What if they mix food coloring for different color glazes?) That&#39;s a BIG chunk of &quot;subjects&quot; but they don&#39;t lay themselves all out in neat little boxes all labeled and time boxed as they do when you&#39;ve got &quot;math lessons time&quot; and &quot;reading time&quot; and so on. Which is why it can help when you&#39;re getting started to write it out and learn to SEE the learning going on. After a time, you won&#39;t need to do that (unless, again, it&#39;s needed for legal reporting) because you&#39;ll have deschooled your own self and learned to trust the learning that is happening. It&#39;s a lot like a garden - you put the seeds in the ground; you water, maybe weed a bit, hope there&#39;s not a freak spring snowstorm, and you wait. All the initial growth is invisible to you - trying to check on it involves basically killing that growth by pulling up the plant to check the roots. And then lo and behold out springs a wee green sprout. You can water, weed, wait some more or you can root up that sprout to check the growth - and again, kill it in the process. You have to trust that growth is happening and that in some weeks from now you&#39;ll have some yummy produce. And when that produce arrives, how exciting is that! Because you simply watered, weeded, maybe added compost, and waited and the growth happened (maybe even in spite of you!)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
