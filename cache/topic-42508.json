They are most easily passed in warm moist environments ...such as indoor places with lots of people. One of the easiest things you can do to boost your immune system is to get plenty of vitamin d which your body makes from being out in sunlight. Another important thing is handwashing. My kids like to get their hands wet and soapy, press their palms together then pull them somewhat apart so there is a hole in the middle and blow a bubble. Hand sanitizer is also good and there is a couple of brands you can get from health food stores if you want one that is alcohol free. Vitamin c gummies are helpful and coconut oil is naturally anti viral and can be cooked in food and rubbed in the skin as a lotion.<br/>\nThe water resistant pants can be helpful and like another poster said options ! and detective work :) ...sometimes running by goodwill and getting a light jacket that is a bit to big can make all the difference. A lot of times kiddos don&#39;t have free movement in their coats and a sweater with a light jacket that is a bit to big feels so much better. Layering can also keep one warmer.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: my daughter getting sick often","postDate":"1261431784","msgId":42511,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhnb3E1OCs0Y2szQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhnb2U4YitiYm1yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42508,"nextInTopic":42514,"prevInTime":42510,"nextInTime":42512,"topicId":42508,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Three year olds are often verrrrrry invested in making choices - developmentally, they re starting to explore decision making in big ways, and getting in the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-342145074\">Three year olds are often verrrrrry invested in making choices - developmentally, they&#39;re starting to explore decision making in big ways, and getting in the way of that can lead to a very unhappy 3yo. So look for lots and lots of ways for your dd to be able to make choices in her daily life. That doesn&#39;t mean all the choices all the time, but as many as you possibly can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;in my &quot;old&quot; life, i would have made her wear a coat and hat, and would probably not had let her be out as long as she was b/c she had a cold<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did that work? Was it a battle? If not, then maybe its not such a big deal right now for you to do some nudging and insisting, just make sure she has lots of chances to make decisions in other areas of life. At the same time, look for ways to create even more options. What Will she wear? layers? boots? ear muffs? Will she change clothes and get dry if she knows she can go right back out? Will she change if you bring her something warm from the dryer to change into? Can you bring her warm drinks? milk or juice heated up in the microwave? <br/>\n<br/>\nCome up with some fun stuff to do After she comes back in, too. Make coming back in desirable, not a defeat. Hot coco, and smores with a cookie chaser. Mmmm. Coming inside is goooood.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn top of all of that, look for other ways to boost her immune system. Its not just about getting cold and wet, after all - some kids seem to be able to play in icy mud without getting so much as a sniffle. If she&#39;s prone to getting sick, look for other ways to keep her healthy. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301676677,"authorName":"Monica Van Stelton","from":"Monica Van Stelton &lt;tatyland_usa@...&gt;","profile":"tatyland_usa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] my daughter getting sick often","postDate":"1261427989","msgId":42514,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU4ODYyNy4zMjIxMy5xbUB3ZWI1NjEwMS5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhnb2U4YitiYm1yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42511,"nextInTopic":42521,"prevInTime":42513,"nextInTime":42515,"topicId":42508,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, My baby got a cold, and I thought he got it because we went outside on the cold the day before...So I felt guilty and called the doctor and she told me,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1281855119\">Hello,<br/>\nMy baby got a cold, and I thought he got it because we went outside on the cold the day before...So I felt guilty and called the doctor and she told me, the cold is a virus that you get from people not from the weather!

The reason I am writing the post is because I wonder if I can/should do something to try to help her not get sick.  By that I mean, she always chooses to run around outside without winter gear (hats, coats, etc.).  I always have them handy but let her decide when/if she wants to wear them. This last time (just before she got croup) she was running around in the snow, getting soaked, in cold weather and had a cold.  That night, she got croup.  Now, I was feeling bad b/c in my &quot;old&quot; life, i would have made her wear a coat and hat, and would probably not had let her be out as long as she was b/c she had a cold.  In our &quot;new&quot; life, I let her tell me if/when she was cold, wanted more clothing, or wanted to go in.  And, on top of that, my mother (who is not supportive of our lifestyle) said to me today that don&#39;t I think my dd would not have gotten sick if she wore coat and hats outside.  I&#39;m just wondering if this is a situation in which I *should* be more directive and dress her more when she has a cold and running around outside in the snow, cold, etc. I feel like when she gets this sick, it is a safety thing and I should step in more to guide her. Also, if she is really sick (recovering from croup) and she wants to go out, shouldn&#39;t I make her dress more to keep her from getting mroe sick?  I&#39;d love to hear yoiur thoughts.  thanks, natalie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42494,"nextTopicId":42421}}
