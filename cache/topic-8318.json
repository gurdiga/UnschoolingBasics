They won&#39;t remember <br/>\nit unless they need the information for a real life reason. History is <br/>\nusually presented in such a dull format...but history is really <br/>\nstories. Stories of interesting people and events, not a timeline to <br/>\nremember.  I bet they&#39;re interested in fascinating stories....most of <br/>\nus are. <br/>\nHave they learned that George Washington is the first president of the <br/>\nUnited States? I bet they could quite confidently tell you that &quot;fact&quot;.<br/>\nThe truth of the matter is, he WASN&#39;T!<br/>\nHe was actually the 8th president.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is more important? For your children to know a set of facts, <br/>\nor to have questioning minds that are ready and willing to absorb new <br/>\ninformation when it comes along? I say the ready mind is far better <br/>\nthan some predictable set of facts you could just look up on your <br/>\ncomputer anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8309,"nextTopicId":8335}}
