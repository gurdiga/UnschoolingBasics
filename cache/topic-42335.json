All my research indicated that this type of microscope is the best type to get for the younger ages. My own experience as a kid, and from observation, is that a cell-level microscope is much more complicated to use, and gets boring fast with the younger ages. There was actually an article in the NYTimes written by a scientist that talked about this issue. With a stereomicroscope, you just plop the item on the platform - no preparing slides, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI used <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greatscopes.com/,\">http://greatscopes.com/,</a> which gave us a discount for homeschoolers. We also invested in extra eye pieces so that we could get greater magnification for our scope. At the time I bought it, my kids were 3 and 5 yrs. The 3 year old loved it a lot. Although most stereomicroscopes have 2 eyepieces, my 3 year old&#39;s eye width was too small to use both in the beginning. She was fine just using one eye. She is now 4 and can use 2 eyes fine. Unfortunately, there&#39;s a limit to how small they made the width between the eyepieces. If you talk to the own at the website above, he&#39;ll give you lots of good advice. Even now, both my kids regularly use the stereomicroscope to look at all sorts of things they find around the house and outside. I use it a lot myself and I love it. My now-7-year-old is now asking for a cell-level microscope, which I plan to save for and buy. But I&#39;m really glad we got the stereomicroscope first - it&#39;s just such a versatile and great intro to the micro world. <br/>\n<br/>\nTrish</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] 2 year old dd wants a microscope...ideas/advice","postDate":"1260395841","msgId":42397,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhEQUQwNTlELTJDRDAtNEY5MC1CMkRELUE3RjI2QkQ2N0Y0MUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDcyNjk3NS41NTE0Ni5xbUB3ZWI1MTcwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDcyNjk3NS41NTE0Ni5xbUB3ZWI1MTcwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":42394,"nextInTopic":42401,"prevInTime":42396,"nextInTime":42398,"topicId":42335,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
