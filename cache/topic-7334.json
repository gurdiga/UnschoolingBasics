I think the best thing you <br/>\ncan do is give your husband lots of reading material that deal with <br/>\nunschooling, especially ones that have essays from unschooling <br/>\nchildren that are now adults.  Subscribe to Live Free, Learn Free <br/>\nand Life Learning.  Life Learning (the last issue) had an excellent <br/>\narticle about college, success, and money and how they are not <br/>\nconnected!  It is a good one for those that worry about their <br/>\nchildrens &quot;success&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was never absolutely against unschooling, as far as the <br/>\nschool part goes but we had some hurdles to cross over to radical <br/>\nunschooling.  And he did have some issues with being a little <br/>\nschooly but it didn&#39;t take him long to examine his thinking.  He is <br/>\nVERY pro-radical unschooling now!  He has his issues, as we all do, <br/>\nto do better, but he really loves the way we live.  He thanked me <br/>\nPROFUSELY before the conference for showing him this way of life!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBring your husband to next years conference too!!  That can do a lot <br/>\nto change a persons thinking!!  It is so uplifting to be around all <br/>\nthese wonderful, unique people.  I loved it when Ren and I were <br/>\neating lunch one day and 3 or 4 teenage girls joined us just to <br/>\nchat!!  I mean, how many teenagers do you know that like to be <br/>\naround adults?  It is because they can trust us!!  My husband was <br/>\njust in awe of all the wonderful people that we met and he is so <br/>\nexcited for next years conference.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Ren said, when he insists that you do lessons (if that is the <br/>\ncase), let him know that he is more than welcome to do &quot;lessons&quot; <br/>\nwith them.  More than likely it will end that discussion.  Tell him <br/>\nabout all the wonderful things you do, even if it is just a cool TV <br/>\nshow that you watched.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\nChildren aren&#39;t coloring books.
