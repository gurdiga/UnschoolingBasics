I hope she heals fast---physically and emotionally!<br/>\n<br/>\n  My sister-in-law, the pediatric oncology nurse, recommended this to me <br/>\nwhen I asked about Hannah Jenner&#39;s meds being so awful:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Get Skittles and warm them in your hands. When they are soft enough to <br/>\nflatten, then put the meds inside and wrap the flattened Skittle around <br/>\nit. *Don&#39;t* do this surreptitiously! Let her know what you&#39;re doing so <br/>\nthat she doesn&#39;t bite down on it accidentally. But that way she can eat <br/>\na few, swallow one whole, and then chew a few more.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
