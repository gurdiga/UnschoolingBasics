An interest in having a pen-pal (or chat pal, like my young friend) can be enough of an interest for some people to build relationships out of nothing, but more often people need reasons to connect. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t a &quot;have to&quot; as in there&#39;s some kind of rule, its more a matter of seeing how people form relationships in real life and using that information to help our kids. School sets us up to think kids form relationships with age-peers more often than not, when that&#39;s purely a result of packing dozens of age-peers into the same space every day. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo part of deschooling for many parents involves stepping away from using the standardized formula of &quot;I have a (gender) child who is (x) years old&quot; as a way of helping another person find real peers and companions. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: looking for penpal","postDate":"1303413427","msgId":46564,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlvcHZyaitkZDF1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg3NjY2NS4zNzgxMC5xbUB3ZWIzODUwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46563,"nextInTopic":46565,"prevInTime":46563,"nextInTime":46565,"topicId":46557,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ***************** It may take some time.

This is an ongoing issue for the majority of homeschoolers in a general sense - we&#39;re a very scattered minority group and when you pare your group down even more (from homeschool to unschool for instance) you&#39;ll have even less of a chance connecting. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one reason why it can be important to look for ways to connect with other people (people of all ages, not just kids close in age) based on interests rather than &quot;unschooling&quot; - because just finding other unschoolers isn&#39;t enough. My 9yo, for instance, looks forward to getting to play with her unschooling friends at campouts, but has no interest in writing letters or getting on Facebook. In the past I tried to connect with other unschooling families - give out our address or my email to try and get something going - and the result was I ended up disappointing other families/kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nMore recently I&#39;ve been helping a homeschooling friend of mine connect via facebook. She enjoys chatting in a general sort of way, and if very social so if your daughter likes to chat about popular tv, movies, games, clothes and hair and whatnot, look me up on facebook and send me a note and I&#39;ll send some friend suggestions. But she&#39;s not an unschooler. &lt;shrug&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":435524708,"authorName":"Shannon VANDERHEIDE","from":"Shannon VANDERHEIDE &lt;shannon.vanderheide@...&gt;","profile":"shannon.vanderheide","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: looking for penpal","postDate":"1303412093","msgId":46563,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGltczJCakNDNUJXNWkyczhMbjF0K3g0aFc0eC1RQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlvcHA1NithYWlvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDUwNTM0NC41OTU0NS5xbUB3ZWIzODUwMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+CTxpb3BwNTYrYWFpb0BlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":46562,"nextInTopic":46564,"prevInTime":46562,"nextInTime":46564,"topicId":46557,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We live on an island with no other kids and my daughter really likes having penpals, so I think it s great idea.
