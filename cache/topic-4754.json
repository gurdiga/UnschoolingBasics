BTW, I&#39;ve been here a bit, just<br/>\nreading and trying to formulate answers to my own<br/>\nproblem, but this email nicely points me the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is my wonderful dh who&#39;s so<br/>\ninstitutionalized in school that he&#39;s having a hard<br/>\ntime with unschooling. Our son and I have gradually<br/>\nbeen moving towards unschooling, but dh is<br/>\nsimultaneously resistant and supportive. I think the<br/>\nproblem he has with it is that our son is a lot like<br/>\nhim in that they both love to play video games, design<br/>\ncool things on the computer, and they both love movies<br/>\nand music. So, when John (ds) chooses to play games,<br/>\nor watch Monty Python, or listen to The Corsairs, or<br/>\npractice his drums for hours on end, dh doesn&#39;t think<br/>\nJohn&#39;s learning anything. He asks ds what he&#39;s done<br/>\nfor &quot;school&quot; and I see it in ds&#39;s eyes the clamming<br/>\nup. I also see in dh&#39;s eyes the bewilderment wrestling<br/>\nwith frustration. I simply didn&#39;t know how to approach<br/>\nthis growing path of unschooling we&#39;re now on without<br/>\ngetting defensive when dh makes comments like, &quot;But he<br/>\n*needs* to know X,Y, or Z&quot; or &quot;We&#39;re the parents;<br/>\nwe&#39;re supposed to *tell* him X, Y, or Z.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t mind, Ren, I&#39;d like to forward dh your<br/>\nunschooling philosophy--it so closely correlates with<br/>\nwhat&#39;s in my heart but that&#39;s having a hard time<br/>\ngetting past my tongue.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany MANY thanks!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nLisette<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I am new to all of this and I am wondering why<br/>\n&gt; unschooling is <br/>\n&gt; better?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not just better, it&#39;s the ONLY way to truly<br/>\n&gt; honor your child&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; interests and intelligence.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s just put it in personal terms.

It sucks.<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling is valuing the child enough to TRUST<br/>\n&gt; that they are <br/>\n&gt; intelligent and capable.<br/>\n&gt; That trust says you don&#39;t need to coerce them, you<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t need <br/>\n&gt; to &quot;teach&quot; anything, you simply need to provide a<br/>\n&gt; rich, interesting <br/>\n&gt; environment and they will flourish.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; People always ask about &quot;gaps&quot; in learning. Don&#39;t we<br/>\n&gt; all have them?<br/>\n&gt; Do you know any two adults that have the same<br/>\n&gt; knowledge, even in the <br/>\n&gt; same workplace? If certain knowledge is &quot;basic&quot; (or<br/>\n&gt; needed <br/>\n&gt; information to survive in a certain society), then<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t it pretty <br/>\n&gt; BASIC to learn it? YES.<br/>\n&gt; Children naturally pick up what they are surrounded<br/>\n&gt; by.<br/>\n&gt; My children know a lot of things I don&#39;t know, so<br/>\n&gt; they really, truly <br/>\n&gt; learn from their interests, whether you are aware of<br/>\n&gt; it or not!!:)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anytime you think you want to try something on your<br/>\n&gt; children, or <br/>\n&gt; treat them a certain way, just pretend another adult<br/>\n&gt; is doing  it to <br/>\n&gt; you and suddenly it changes the way you parent and<br/>\n&gt; approach <br/>\n&gt; education.<br/>\n&gt; It changes your entire life.

I&#39;ve just pulled them out of ps to blossom into what they were intended to be. They are 14 & 13 year old young men. The question that is on my mind is: Why can&#39;t I just order the Preparation to CAT software and book? I could have them do one page a day and be ready for that &quot;test&quot;. Right now they&#39;re so busy doing homeschool work they don&#39;t have time to &quot;fun&quot; read, or play a boardgame. <br/>\n <br/>\nI work full time and they do their lessons during the day. We communicate by webcam and Nextel while I&#39;m away. When I get home, we run to the &quot;Y&quot;, or the library, or the movies, or basketball practice, or church, or.... you get the picture. Then I&#39;m up at 9 PM helping them finish the alloted pages we&#39;ve been told to complete per day (prepackaged curriculum).<br/>\n <br/>\nAny positive feedback is appreciated.

School? Because they&#39;re free to learn what they want when they want. They can delve into passions and be excited about learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a million reasons unschooling is better than school. Can you think of ONE reason school is better?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think that is what freezes me in my steps is that you can <br/>\n&gt;teach and not be teaching from a book.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can *learn* and *not be learning* from a book. And from anything else as well if you are/aren&#39;t interested in it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My son is in 6th grade and if things continue how they are, he is going to fail.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fail sixth grade school or fail life? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am pulling him out as soon as possible as he has fallen through the cracks since he is so quiet and wont ask for help.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cool! He probably doesn&#39;t ask for help because he&#39;d be ridiculed or shamed. Plus----seeking &quot;help&quot; in school can sometimes be construed as cheating. In the real world, it&#39;s what we do when we....um....need help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you unschool dont they still need to take the FCAT?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What&#39;s an FCAT? Seriously. What&#39;s an FCAT? <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess they don&#39;t *have* to! &lt;g&gt; In SC we have PAC tests. These are ONLY for public schooled children. Private schools may choose a different kind of standardized test. Homeschoolers are not required to test at all here. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How do you get around that? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are many ways to get around testing. Unschoolers only test if it is required by the state, and *still* there are ways to invalidate the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat state are you in?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome unschoolers choose to take the SAT & ACT. They study for it: there are books and websites. They certainly don&#39;t need 12 years of school to learn to take a test!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

Can you think of ONE reason school is better?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think that is what freezes me in my steps is that you can <br/>\n&gt;teach and not be teaching from a book.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can *learn* and *not be learning* from a book. And from anything else as well if you are/aren&#39;t interested in it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My son is in 6th grade and if things continue how they are, he is going to fail.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fail sixth grade school or fail life? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am pulling him out as soon as possible as he has fallen through the cracks since he is so quiet and wont ask for help.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cool! He probably doesn&#39;t ask for help because he&#39;d be ridiculed or shamed. Plus----seeking &quot;help&quot; in school can sometimes be construed as cheating. In the real world, it&#39;s what we do when we....um....need help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you unschool dont they still need to take the FCAT?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What&#39;s an FCAT? Seriously. What&#39;s an FCAT? <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess they don&#39;t *have* to! &lt;g&gt; In SC we have PAC tests. These are ONLY for public schooled children. Private schools may choose a different kind of standardized test. Homeschoolers are not required to test at all here. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How do you get around that? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are many ways to get around testing. Unschoolers only test if it is required by the state, and *still* there are ways to invalidate the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat state are you in?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome unschoolers choose to take the SAT & ACT. They study for it: there are books and websites. They certainly don&#39;t need 12 years of school to learn to take a test!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196608294,"authorName":"rosesgrow1","from":"&quot;rosesgrow1&quot; &lt;rosesgrow1@...&gt;","profile":"rosesgrow1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Why is unschooling better?","postDate":"1106762887","msgId":4754,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGN0OG1hNytldXU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4755,"prevInTime":4753,"nextInTime":4755,"topicId":4754,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am new to all of this and I am wondering why unschooling is better?
