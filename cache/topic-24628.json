I work<br/>\nfull-time and we don&#39;t have unlimited resources. But I know that if I<br/>\nreally, really wanted to see someone I would find a way. So we found a<br/>\nway to get her up here several weekends. We did some creative problem<br/>\nsolving with friends that were doing driving anyway.

That would be<br/>\nhypocritical. <br/>\n<br/>\nI try to find ways for us all to get our needs met. We all work<br/>\ntowards that end, most of the time. The occasional break-downs are<br/>\nusually a good time for reflection and learning where we could do<br/>\nbetter the next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t buy everything we want. We work within the very real budget<br/>\nwe have. But the kids needs and desires are taken seriously. The tools<br/>\nthey choose for exploring their world is something we believe is<br/>\nimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe trust them as intelligent human beings that get tired and hungry<br/>\nand need help and assistance at times....but not control. Last night,<br/>\nas I sat at this very computer, Jalen came in and said &quot;I&#39;m tired Mom,<br/>\ncome lay down with me now.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many six year olds that have an arbitrary bed time (a time that is<br/>\nconvenient for the parents, not when the child is tired) will do that?<br/>\nI NEVER would have asked to be put to bed as a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe results of trust are pretty well-balanced and trusting<br/>\nindividuals. Trust builds trust. FUnny eh?

With endless resources online and through the internet, and a house stocked full of books, puzzles, games, movies, etc-   I have no doubt we can meet the kids&#39; learning needs. And while it appears there may be little if any distinction between unschooling and &quot;unparenting&quot;, there still is some in my mind. And that may be due to money (or our lack thereof).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The &quot;unparenting&quot; (I&#39;m still unsure about what the official term is) has a ring of elitism to it. And take what I say with a grain of salt, because my exposure to all this has been exactly one week. But I&#39;ve been reading posts to my husband over the past week, and we&#39;ve come to the conclusion that we just flat can&#39;t afford to live this lifestyle.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Times were good when I was working, so we have a lot of &quot;things&quot; leftover from that era. It&#39;s hard to come to our home and think of the kids as deprived. We did maintain a subscription to netflix, so the kids get to take turns picking movies. They get to choose what to wear from what they have, and in general we try to accommodate their requests when we can. (There are small and creative ways we&#39;ve been able to do this.) But we get Angelfood (boxes of food that is picked out by someone else), which has been a lifesaver for us, but at the same time removes all choice as to what we eat from the equation. We eat what we get. All of us do. We don&#39;t have the gas money to go wherever we want, and we can&#39;t buy any new &quot;things&quot;.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I like some of the things I&#39;ve read in this thread. Someone suggested that it&#39;s a &quot;want&quot; the kids need fulfilled. Our challenge is to find a way to meet that want without spending any money at all. Sometimes the effort involved is all the kids need to know their desires are being respected, and that we hear their voices.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (I would say I&#39;m giving my $.02, but we&#39;re watching every penny  ;-)   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  :-)  Jennifer  (Ethan-9, Emily-4, Eliot-2 on Monday)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          ~~I think it is important for her to know me, who I am, and that,<br/>\namong other things, I live by certain values and convictions. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s true, that we can honor our own preferences while still<br/>\nrespecting our children&#39;s, but have you thought about the fact that a<br/>\nlot of our &quot;values&quot; and &quot;convictions&quot; would go right out the window if<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t live in such luxury?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the discussions about vegetarianism and what companies to<br/>\nsupport etc...are completely pointless when one lives in poverty.<br/>\nSuddenly your &quot;values&quot; are all about surviving and you can&#39;t be as<br/>\nuptight with those when one is worried about the next meal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize most of us have a fridge full of food, a comfortable house<br/>\nand such, but recently I&#39;ve realized that a lot of my high ideals are<br/>\na result of living in complete luxury for most of my life.

So what do you say?????<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you really think we buy our kids whatever they ask for? All the <br/>\ntime?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It really IS about finding a way to meet his need. The need may be <br/>\n&gt; addressed in other ways. Like with the erasers as stamps.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Go to a mini-bike store and look around. Ask to sit on one.<br/>\n&gt; Go to a hardware store, look at chainsaws. See how heavy they are. <br/>\nNote <br/>\n&gt; how dull the chains actually are. Maybe find someone who is <br/>\ncutting <br/>\n&gt; down a tree and go watch.<br/>\n&gt; Go to the tractor store. Compare the sizes and what each can do. <br/>\nAsk a <br/>\n&gt; farmer for a ride.<br/>\n&gt; Go to an air show. Go inside a helicopter.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ask each of these people/owners how much their &quot;toys&quot; cost. $5.9 <br/>\n&gt; million for a helicopter---that&#39;s a wee bit more than our HOUSE! <br/>\n&lt;g&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Would he be willing for all of you to give up your home to live in <br/>\na <br/>\n&gt; helicopter? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s hard to understand the value of $$, but talking about how <br/>\nmany <br/>\n&gt; houses you could buy for the same amount of $$ might make more <br/>\nsense. <br/>\n&gt; How many CD or video games or shoes could you buy for the price of <br/>\none <br/>\n&gt; _________?

It can  <br/>\neven be argued--quite persuasively--that by helping China&#39;s economy  <br/>\ngrow, we improve the lot of children in that country.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone interested, below is part of a report I wrote up for a  <br/>\nfriend when I read the book &quot;Why Globalization Works&quot; last winter  <br/>\n(she doesn&#39;t have time to read so she likes me to tell her about the  <br/>\nbooks I read). I don&#39;t want to derail the list, but when we&#39;re making  <br/>\ndecisions about how to respond to our children based on our beliefs  <br/>\nabout how the world works and what is good and bad, it&#39;s important to  <br/>\nkeep in mind that we could be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu<br/>\n<br/>\nTo my friend Adrianne:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading &quot;Why Globalization Works&quot; by Martin Wolf, and  <br/>\nregretting it. First, it is the most dense and difficult book I have  <br/>\ntackled since last year&#39;s history-of-markets-and-portfolio-theory  <br/>\ncrash course. But mainly I am regretting it because it is turning me  <br/>\ninto an opponent of trade barriers and an advocate of free trade.  <br/>\nBecause trade barriers are bad and free trade is good, and I am way  <br/>\ntoo tired and lazy and overwhelmed by all the info I have taken in  <br/>\nand not fully assimilated to give you a big rundown of it, but I will  <br/>\ngive you some highlights.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when I read &quot;The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global  <br/>\nEconomy,&quot; the author of that book mentioned that the kinds of  <br/>\nmanufacturing being done now in China for low wages relative to wages  <br/>\nin the west is one step on a known trajectory of development, and  <br/>\nit&#39;s a step that can&#39;t be skipped. But that author didn&#39;t go into  <br/>\ndetail. Wolf does. Here are some of the details:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. You can&#39;t go right to more complex, less labor-intensive, and  <br/>\nhigher-paid industries in a developing nation because the population  <br/>\nof the developing nation is neither skilled nor productive enough.  <br/>\nThe kind of low-skilled, labor-intensive manufacturing being done in  <br/>\nChina now has already been done in Japan and Korea, to name two  <br/>\nplaces, neither of which does that kind of manufacturing anymore-- <br/>\nthey&#39;ve moved on to more complex and sophisticated manufacturing that  <br/>\nrequires experienced and skilled managers and workers. If you try to  <br/>\npay western-style wages in a place that is at the level of  <br/>\ndevelopment China is at right now, for instance, no one will start  <br/>\nbusinesses there because the cost of labor will make the inevitable  <br/>\nmistakes and failures of infant industries too costly to bear.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Wages are low in China because the alternative--agricultural  <br/>\nlabor--is even worse paid and yet there are still plenty of people to  <br/>\ndo it. Wages for factory work will not rise in China until enough  <br/>\npeople have migrated from the rural areas to the developed areas in  <br/>\nsearch of the improved opportunities there. When there is an  <br/>\nagricultural labor shortage, agriculture wages will rise and so will  <br/>\nfactory wages, probably very quickly when it does happen (this has  <br/>\nhappened in Japan and Korea). This is part of why what is happening  <br/>\nin China is a step that can&#39;t be skipped. But it may be a prolonged  <br/>\nstep because of internal barriers on migration from rural areas. [A  <br/>\nnote added just now: I recently heard a report on NPR about how  <br/>\nfactories in China are beginning to have difficulty finding workers  <br/>\nat the same low wages, so this upward wage pressure is beginning to  <br/>\nhappen there, apparently.]<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo really interesting China factoids to remember the next time  <br/>\nsomeone tells you, as someone recently told me, &quot;I don&#39;t let my  <br/>\nchildren buy toys made in China. I tell them that some kid just like  <br/>\nthem had to work in a factory in China to make that toy, and if they  <br/>\nbuy that toy, it hurts that child.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The percentage of the Chinese people living in extreme poverty  <br/>\ndropped from 33% in 1990 to 18% in 1999. This 9-year drop is  <br/>\ndescribed by Wolf as the most rapid and extensive decline in poverty  <br/>\nrates that has ever been recorded. Ever. Anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The percentage of Chinese children aged 10-14 who are in the labor  <br/>\nforce dropped from 30% in 1980 to 8% in the late 1990s.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of these changes have been driven by China&#39;s liberalizing  <br/>\neconomic policies and the growth of manufacturing for export.<br/>\n<br/>\nWolf says, &quot;People don&#39;t put their children to work unless poverty  <br/>\ndrives them to do so. The best way to get children out of the  <br/>\nworkforce is to reduce poverty.&quot; Simply implementing a policy against  <br/>\nchild labor can do more harm than good if poverty rates are not  <br/>\nimproved and other options are not made available. For instance,  <br/>\nunder international pressure to eliminate child labor in Bangladeshi  <br/>\nfactories where goods were being produced for Wal-Mart, children were  <br/>\nlaid off from Bangladesh factories. The numbers of children engaged  <br/>\nin prostitution in Bangladesh consequently quadrupled.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: giving, spending, finances","postDate":"1182544867","msgId":24641,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1aGM1MyttbnYyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDOTgzMDVCMjYxQUMzQS0xMDQ0LTE4ODAyQEZXTS1NMTQuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":24640,"nextInTopic":24647,"prevInTime":24640,"nextInTime":24642,"topicId":24628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So what do you say?????<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* say, that I am really sorry we can&#39;t, but that we simply don&#39;t have the  <br/>\nmoney to spend right now on that. I keep it simple and clear. When I am able <br/>\nand  I CAN, I do say yes to as many things as are asked for - but I also have a <br/>\n responsibility to use the household money as wisely as possible. My kids <br/>\nseem to  really get this. They know, Julian especially (who is 4) that we do <br/>\noften get a  little something, so when I have to say &quot;no&quot; it&#39;s reasonable, and <br/>\nthat his ants  and needs are respected. My gut feeling, is that this is really <br/>\nthe goal. Always  saying yes to things like items and toys and what-not, no <br/>\nmatter the  consequences, seems like an odd suggestion for any parenting style. It <br/>\nseems  that what we are trying to impart is a sense of fun, learning, the <br/>\nsupport to  help our children think critically, t always think about why we say <br/>\n&quot;no&quot; to  something and how we can alter that to either a different word or a <br/>\ndifferent  response. So many of us conventionally trained folks say &quot;no&quot; for <br/>\nreasons that  if one thinks critically about, make no sense. I see *this* as the <br/>\ndeeper part  of the issue. Simply saying yes to all things all the time really <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make  sense to me (like the request for a helicopter...you can <br/>\ndiscuss how purchasing  one is not affordable, but you can mention that flight <br/>\nlessons are available,  and that maybe we can&#39;t purchase one, but maybe we should <br/>\nlook into having a  scenic ride, or becoming a pilot). I want the few &quot;no&#39;s&quot; I <br/>\nsay to make sense and  be respectful and thoughtful answers. I say no to many <br/>\nthings, but I always try  to discuss it, why I say &quot;no&quot; and all issues <br/>\nsurrounding it. Am I getting the  unschooling parenting? I think so. I feel good, <br/>\nopen and fairly honest, lol, I  know I&#39;m not perfect and that&#39;s cool with me. <br/>\nWhat I AM doing is becoming more  and more comfortable with following my children <br/>\nas they lead me, with my style,  with my terminology, with myself. It&#39;s an <br/>\nongoing process, lol! I think the more  I do so, the more I&#39;ll be able to use <br/>\nmore &quot;yes&quot; type language, or rather more,  &quot;Why not?&quot; style of responding to the <br/>\nkids. I&#39;m getting better.

It&#39;s about evaluating <br/>\nknee jerk reactions (yes and no) and finding where those are coming <br/>\nfrom; it&#39;s also about removing arbitrarily determined rules and <br/>\nboundaries. Budget is a REAL constraint, not an arbitrary one. We&#39;ve <br/>\nnever had a problem looking at something with DS and saying &quot;gee <br/>\nthat&#39;s pretty cool looking. Hmm it&#39;s also $30 - that&#39;s a bit much <br/>\nfor our money right now. Let&#39;s put that on the wish list (a real, <br/>\nphysically written down list when DS was younger, now it resides <br/>\nmore in his memory - an amazing memory at that lol) for next payday <br/>\nand look for something else right now.&quot; Or, if we -had- the money <br/>\nbut it was earmarked for something else, we&#39;d put that on the <br/>\ntable &quot;well, I had been keeping $30 aside so we could go to the <br/>\nmovie on Monday. We can either buy this OR go to the movie but we <br/>\ndon&#39;t have the money right now for both. My choice would be the <br/>\nmovie since we could all go and get snacks and everything. What do <br/>\nyou think?&quot; and we&#39;d stand there in the store aisle and discuss pros <br/>\nand cons of BOTH options plus any other things we could think of <br/>\n(get a less expensive item and smuggle in our own snacks or get <br/>\nfewer snacks or whatever). It made for really LONG grocery trips in <br/>\nparticular as we&#39;d go along and see stuff that wasn&#39;t in the budget <br/>\nas planned but could fit if we changed things a bit - e.g. &quot;This <br/>\nbubble kit looks really cool. Can we get it?&quot; &quot;That&#39;s pretty fun <br/>\nlooking. Let&#39;s see - it&#39;s $5. How about we note it down (I always <br/>\nhave a list and a pen in the grocery store) and come back to it?&quot; <br/>\nThen we&#39;d finish the alloted shopping and I&#39;d look at the total (I <br/>\nkeep a rough running total on said list with said pen) and see if <br/>\nthere was space to flat out buy that item. If there was (like if the <br/>\nsalmon we&#39;d planned on looked really ugly so we skipped that), <br/>\ngreat, we&#39;d head back and get it. If there was no space, we&#39;d look <br/>\nat what was in the cart and see if there was any wiggle room -<br/>\n &quot;well, looks like we&#39;re right up to the edge of the grocery money. <br/>\nWe did get 3 boxes of cereal so we could have something we all <br/>\nliked. If we put two back and get just one BIG bag of &lt;brand&gt; <br/>\ncereal, we&#39;d have enough for the bubbles. Which should we do?&quot; By <br/>\nthen, the bubbles might still be important or they might have lost <br/>\ntheir luster in favor of something else (a favorite cereal with a <br/>\npromised &quot;prize&quot; inside; some ice cream; donuts; cottage cheese - <br/>\nyes cottage cheese was one of DS&#39; preferences one time - whatever). <br/>\nOne BIG thing is that whatever you offer (we could put these cereals <br/>\nback to get the bubbles) you need to be willing to follow through <br/>\non - offering that as an option then pushing your own choice negates <br/>\nthe whole effort. If you offer a choice, you need to be okay with <br/>\nwhatever is chosen. If there&#39;s something totally off limits (we&#39;re <br/>\nnot buying that cute $15 dog toy - we don&#39;t have a dog!), make sure <br/>\nit&#39;s not offered. (of course, some of those dog toys make cool kid <br/>\ntoys as well).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result at our house is a 9 yr old who had birthday money plus <br/>\nallowance in his pocket (roughly $60), looked at a $40 brand new <br/>\nvideogame and said &quot;Gee this is $40 that&#39;s too expensive, let&#39;s look <br/>\nfor something else.&quot; And we found a less expensive and now favorite <br/>\ngame instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nA helicopter? LOL he&#39;s got big aspirations doesn&#39;t he? That&#39;s where <br/>\nyou might say &quot;Wow that&#39;d be cool. What could we do if we actually <br/>\nhad a real helicopter?&quot; and go with it, along with &quot;They cost more <br/>\nthan our whole house (or whatever)&quot; and &quot;How about we go over to <br/>\n&lt;airport&gt; and bring a picnic lunch and sit in the car and watch the <br/>\nhelicopters and planes&quot; and &quot;Well, a real helicopter is very <br/>\nexpensive but we could go to &lt;dollar store&gt; and see if they have any <br/>\nlittler ones that we could get for us to play with&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe paradigm shift between conventional thinking and unschooling <br/>\ngoes something like this:<br/>\nconventional: we have to make examples of saying No to kids because <br/>\nthey have to learn that they can&#39;t have everything they want. they <br/>\nneed to buck up, deal with disappointment, learn to work for what <br/>\nthey want.<br/>\nunschooling: Life has it&#39;s own real boundaries and parameters and <br/>\nkids will run into them no matter what, it&#39;s our job to facilitate <br/>\nas MUCH of what our family wants (grownups count too) as possible in <br/>\nthe circumstances, creative thinking is important, don&#39;t &#39;settle&#39; <br/>\nfor less when more is possible<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it was a big shining moment for my DH when he realized that <br/>\nnot only could we give DS things he wanted (when we had the money <br/>\nfor them) just because he wanted them BUT DH (and I) could also have <br/>\nwhat we wanted just because we wanted it (when we had the money <br/>\navailable). All of his growing up he got birthday and holiday <br/>\npresents and that was it - everything else was *earned*, with good <br/>\ngrades, extra chores, &quot;proper&quot; behavior, etc. (his family also hit a <br/>\nreally bad streak financially for quite a while so there were times <br/>\nwith no money available at all). To be able to get himself something <br/>\nsimply because he wanted it was part of healing the inside of him <br/>\nthat always felt like he was never &quot;enough&quot; (working hard enough, <br/>\nbeing good enough, etc), always lacking something, a sense of want <br/>\nnot abundance. Something as simple as a $5 magnifying lense (we&#39;re <br/>\ntalking an 11&quot; lense that can set wood on fire) really made his day <br/>\nwhen he bought it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, too, simply having wants taken seriously can help with that <br/>\nsense of abundance even IF you can&#39;t have the item (now or in the <br/>\nforeseeable future).<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":208642734,"authorName":"Susan Maguire","from":"Susan Maguire &lt;asmb65@...&gt;","profile":"asmb65","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: giving, spending, finances","postDate":"1182534937","msgId":24648,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUwMjI1Mi42OTI0OC5xbUB3ZWIzMDkwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":24647,"nextInTopic":24650,"prevInTime":24647,"nextInTime":24649,"topicId":24628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well it s good to know I m at least somewhat on the right track. ... right?

Go inside a helicopter.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Ask each of these people/owners how much their &quot;toys&quot; cost. $5.9<br/>\n&gt;million for a helicopter---that&#39;s a wee bit more than our HOUSE! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Would he be willing for all of you to give up your home to live in a<br/>\n&gt;helicopter? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He&#39;s helped operate a chain saw, sat on mini-bikes, sat on tractors, flown in a helicopter (a generous free flight after we helped a harried helicopter mechanic pack up a bunch of stuff at the airport during fire-fighting season). Now he wants his own! After the chain saw I helped him make a big one out of wood. He&#39;s happy with that now. I often talk about how many honey pails of quarters something would cost (he seems to have a concept of the relative value of a quarter).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest issues fall into the same bucket as Leslie (in NJ)&#39;s. Dealing with issues that hit a real hot button. Especially where I feel that we all need to be doing something now in order to make the changes to make this a better world (or even just a world) 20 years from now. How do I hand my money to a cashier when I can tell from the label that this item was made in a sweat shop by child labour? Can I burden my 2 and 5-year-old with that decision and sadness of it. No.<br/>\n<br/>\nStruggling with all this,<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Be smarter than spam. See how smart SpamGuard is at giving junk email the boot with the All-new Yahoo!

If I come prepared to spend a little extra, I give my son a limit and help him find options that fit HIS budget. Deep down I don&#39;t believe in saying no, so if I didn&#39;t bring $ enough this trip, I&#39;ll say &#39;later&#39;, and make it up to him. That may take a couple days, but the fact that I don&#39;t forget helps prevent a meltdown in the store the next time I have to say &#39;later&#39;. I&#39;d like to add here that I am a thrifty shopper, and a practical toy-buyer, so my son doesn&#39;t usually get the very item he requested first.
