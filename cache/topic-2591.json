On the other hand, be happy - your story sparked a lot of great<br/>\ndiscussion and helpful ideas about this broader issue that we will probably<br/>\nall have to deal with as our children get older.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Do you think that any Unschooling kids have<br/>\nlooked back and said gee I wish my parents would have put their foot down a<br/>\nlittle more?

Also, there is a teen discussion board on<br/>\nwww.unschooling.com . Maybe you would get an answer to this question there.<br/>\n<br/>\nNowhere in Unschooling is there a recommendation that we leave our almost<br/>\nadult children to sink or swim by their own &quot;bad&quot; choices. Most of the time<br/>\nthe recommendation is to be a lot more proactive and supportive. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know if you were saying I wasn&#39;t following group guidelines by<br/>\nsuggesting they be posted again, but I hope you weren&#39;t.

If your<br/>\nopinion truly did not matter, maybe no-one would bother responding at all. I<br/>\nthink when people tell a story that brings up ideas that are pertinent to<br/>\nUnschooling, then that is a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Besides a survey base of three individuals doesn&#39;t mean much<br/>\nstatistically.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn,<br/>\n   So what you&#39;re saying is that my life experience with this issue doesn&#39;t<br/>\nreally matter?  You &quot;sound&quot; very offended by my observations. Who are you,<br/>\nexactly to tell me that my observations are nonsense and that they don&#39;t<br/>\nmean much.  As far as statistically goes I thought Unschoolers were anti<br/>\nstatistics anyway. I am willing to bet though that if they did such studies<br/>\nthat you would find that people who smoked a pack and 1/2 of cigarettes a<br/>\nday would have a tougher time quitting than those that smoked 1/2 a pack a<br/>\nday.<br/>\n    I have a nagging question.  Why is it that, for the most part, I hear a<br/>\nlot about how terrible our parents were and that their decisions in regards<br/>\nto raising us were all wrong?  There seems to be soooo much negativity with<br/>\nour upbringing.  Believe me I had a horrific childhood, but I refuse to let<br/>\nit cloud my every judgment and action.  I have definitely learned from my<br/>\nparents mistakes, but I would be a fool to say that every decision they made<br/>\nwas wrong.  I think very few of you can say that EVERYTHING, every moment<br/>\nwas just unbearable.  I do believe that some of the things they did was<br/>\nbecause they loved me and didn&#39;t want me to get hurt.  I can look back on<br/>\nthat now and see what they wanted for me.  I have chosen a different path<br/>\nfor my children; a different way to parent; to live my life.  I&#39;m not doing<br/>\nit to somehow prove to my parents that they were wrong in their choices.<br/>\n   Maybe I&#39;m reading too much in to your post, but I&#39;m really offended that<br/>\nyou could just blow off my opinion in such a manner.  If I wanted to be<br/>\nblown off I would go back to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnMarie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Robyn Coburn [mailto:dezigna@...]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, August 07, 2004 1:14 PM<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] Conflict of Belief Question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Anyway, my issue is smoking.

Mostly due to the fact that my daughter","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1942371277\">Kelly,<br/>\n    This isn&#39;t really in regards to the pot smoking issue, because I have<br/>\npersonal hang-ups about that one myself.  Mostly due to the fact that my<br/>\ndaughter is so much older than my three boys and if I allow it in the house<br/>\nor any where around the property, I get to do jail time and there is a good<br/>\nchance that my kids will be taken away as well.  I can&#39;t/won&#39;t take that<br/>\nrisk, because one of my kids decides that smoking Pot is for them.  They<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t put the whole family at risk for their need to do something which,<br/>\nlike it or not, is illegal.<br/>\n    Anyway, my issue is smoking.  I have 2 friends which started smoking<br/>\nwhen they were 10.  At 14 they gained the courage to ask their parents for<br/>\npermission which their parents gave them.  I also started smoking at 10, but<br/>\nnever gained that courage.  I see those two friends as being highly addicted<br/>\nto cigarettes to this day.  They find it impossible to quit.  I quit seven<br/>\nyears ago.  Both of these friends say they wish their parents wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\ngiven them permission.  Their theory is that they wouldn&#39;t have smoked as<br/>\nmuch if they had to hide it from their parents and maybe, just maybe, they<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t need it so much now.    I think about my experience quitting and it<br/>\nWAS quite easy because there were only a few times a day when I wanted to<br/>\nsmoke.<br/>\n    I totally agree with giving our children the opportunity to make their<br/>\nown decisions and live their life freely, but I guess I have come to<br/>\nappreciate my parents rule about not smoking. Sometimes I find myself<br/>\nthinking that it&#39;s not so bad to have an unpopular decision.  Maybe my kids<br/>\nmight be mad about it in the immediate moment, but later they may just<br/>\nappreciate it.  Does any one else feel this way?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnMarie<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, August 07, 2004 12:00 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Conflict of Belief Question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 8/6/2004 10:11:49 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:salgenovese@...\">salgenovese@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Her<br/>\n  response is to tell the child that she feels uncomfortable about  him<br/>\ndoing<br/>\n  that and while he lives in her house he needs to live by those  standards<br/>\n  whether he agrees or not.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Right.
