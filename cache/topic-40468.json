My son (6) choose<br/>\nhis books, The Zombie Survival Guide and book 2 of the 39 Clues series. He<br/>\nhasn&#39;t touch either yet. He might not ever read them (though I think he<br/>\nwill) but I support his interest in getting those specific books. We also<br/>\npicked up a Ripley&#39;s Believe it or Not book.

I<br/>\ndoubt her interest will stay with taekwondo for long because so far she<br/>\nchanges obsessions about once a year, but if it did &quot;stick&quot; she could open a<br/>\nschool like her teacher is doing now, and what she&#39;d need to know would be<br/>\nthe taekwondo stuff, with hardly any &quot;science&quot; or &quot;math&quot; other than what<br/>\nshe&#39;d be using. And she&#39;ll always know she can break a board, flip a<br/>\ngrown-up and be fierce. That&#39;s pretty cool stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Did she enjoy the pop star classes? Learning that being a pop star is<br/>\nmore work than she wanted to put in (at this point in her life) is a really<br/>\nimportant thing. I am not sure how old your child/ren is/are but a year is a<br/>\npretty long time to hang on to a passion. My kids change passions<br/>\nfrequently. Some last longer than others (gymnastic, theater, Pokemon) and<br/>\nOthers are short lived (horseback riding, webkinz, baseball). Sometimes my<br/>\nkids think they would like to try some and are uber excited but then when<br/>\nthey try it it doesn&#39;t float their boat. That happens to me as well. I have<br/>\nhad passions that lasted for years (midwifery) and things that I have been<br/>\npassionate for a short time (cooking) and otehr things I tried and didn&#39;t<br/>\nlike. If you look for the positive you will find something cool in<br/>\neverything your kids do.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;with hardly any &quot;science&quot; or &quot;math&quot; other than what she&#39;d be using. &quot; I am<br/>\nunsure what you mean. Why would she need science or math that she wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe using?<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOP: So you&#39;re the &quot;normal&quot; for homeschooling then? Because I do read Holt<br/>\nbut the books by him I pick up are all about how to use life to teach kids<br/>\nstuff, and the emphasis is on teaching. I feel sneaky getting a board game<br/>\non the states or presidents and pretending I want to play it because it will<br/>\nbe &quot;fun&quot; to get them to learn that stuff. I&#39;d rather be honest and just tell<br/>\nthem I&#39;d like them to know whatever because it&#39;s useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** I believe you were already direct to Holt&#39;s chornological bibilography.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t get out board games (or anything) with a goal besides having fun in<br/>\nmind. We play bananagrams because its fun not because I want them to spell<br/>\nbetter or work on logica problems. We paly video games for pure joy rather<br/>\nthan with an agenda. Sure they learn alot from them but that&#39;s not *why* we<br/>\ndo them. Right now my son is playing a lot of Saint&#39;s Row2. He loves to work<br/>\nin the chop shop fixing the cars up. He is learning about color scheme,<br/>\npurchasing, loigcal problem solving and many other things. Math, map skills,<br/>\neye to hand condination, reading and word recognition, etc. But I don&#39;t<br/>\ndiscuss those things with him, he just has fun.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOP: You and Faith and some others say even that isn&#39;t unschooling, so is<br/>\nthere a name for the people who bend over backwards to find and do all the<br/>\n&quot;fun&quot; educational stuff, where the goal is still making sure their kids are<br/>\nlearning stuff? Would that be relaxed homeschooling (I don&#39;t see how it can<br/>\nbe relaxed when the parents have to put so much work into it!)? I&#39;m not<br/>\nusually into labels but for the sake of this conversation it seems like it<br/>\nwould be very useful to be able to differentiate.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I am glad I said that because it isn&#39;t. That is sneaky and I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthat deception brings families closer. If your goal is to have your child<br/>\nlearn X, Y, Z then do what you need to do to get there. But it your goal is<br/>\nto unschool and be respectful and loving family then coercion, deception and<br/>\nforce isn&#39;t goign to work well. I bend over backwards to bring the things<br/>\nthat bring joy into my childrens lives. This is their life, the one chance<br/>\nthey have to have a happy childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking around in my oldest (12) daughter&#39;s room (I am using her<br/>\ncomputer). I look at what she has in her space. It looks like a fairly<br/>\ntypical kids room, bed, dresser, shelves and a desk. She has a computer,<br/>\nprinter and a web cam. She hasinternet acess and frequently uses facebook,<br/>\nGaia, skype and a few other sites. She has books, both fiction and<br/>\nnon-fiction. Predominately fiction. She has shelves of special things. She<br/>\nhas posters she&#39;s made up on her walls. You wouldn&#39;t know if she went to<br/>\nschool or homeschooled or unschooled by her room. It isn&#39;t about how it<br/>\nlooks, its about how I relate to her about her stuff. I don&#39;t limit her<br/>\ninternet acess or computer usage. She is on there a lot. She is a writer and<br/>\nworks on her novel for several hours daily (on and off). I am there to hel<br/>\nif she has questions about anything. I don&#39;t require her to use her things<br/>\nin any certain way. She has no required reading yet reads frequently and<br/>\nenjoys it. We have a closet downstairs that contains board games, dvds,<br/>\nvideo games and such. She is free to pick and chose from any or none. If she<br/>\nwants to play a gmae I am there to play one with her. If I want to play a<br/>\ngmae I migth ask her to join me if she wants, no agenda just fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard for many people to do but take school out of the equation. There<br/>\nis no body of knowledge that everyone *HAS* to have. S/he is not behind,<br/>\ns/he is absolute exactly where s/he needs to be right now.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about this last night after my post (I hope I didn&#39;t sound<br/>\nmean, I&#39;m just frustrated at trying to figure this out). I really feel that<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a choice in the matter. I can see that trying to force learning<br/>\non an unwilling pupil isn&#39;t going to work nor will it stick. Also I&#39;m too<br/>\nhonest with my kids to be getting up hours earlier in the morning to find<br/>\n&quot;fun&quot; activities that will reinforce their math skills or get them to learn<br/>\nsomething. The traits I want for them the most are for them to be able to<br/>\nknow themselves, know what they want, and live a full life, with many and<br/>\nvaried interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Great, I am gald you are honest with your kids, that&#39;s a great start.<br/>\nInstead of thinging in terms of what *you* want for htem, figure out who<br/>\nthey are and how you can embrace that, right now at this moment. Are you who<br/>\nyou were 5 years ago, 10 years ago, when you were 12? let them be themselves<br/>\nwith no agenda to develope into anything or anyone except themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are math skills? Are they seperate from life?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my take on this: If somthing is so important that your child has to<br/>\nknow it for life then life will give opportunities to learn it. If life<br/>\nisn&#39;t providing opportunities then perhaps it isn&#39;t as important as you<br/>\nthink.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"N CONFER","from":"N CONFER &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Hi New Member","postDate":"1245503191","msgId":40512,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5MzU2Ny40MDM5OS5xbUB3ZWI4MzgwMy5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40509,"nextInTopic":40513,"prevInTime":40511,"nextInTime":40513,"topicId":40468,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"LOL!

Oh, this too funny. <br/>\nYes, we have meetings and try to figure out how to trick new unschoolers into keeping their children ignorant.  :)<br/>\nYes, there were maps on the wall here. Yes, there was also a map of the US with the electoral college numbers. A timeline of the Presidents. And a poster of a local sunken ship. And all kinds of art work from DD. And even a times tables poster. What else? Oh, pretty much picture all the walls covered with stuff a decorator would never choose. :)<br/>\nBut it was all put there as things came up.  Elections or news or interests or questions.<br/>\nHere&#39;s another story for you. <br/>\nDD is the younger of my two children. DS read independently before her and by the time DD was almost-6, she was bitter!!! She marched up to me one day and announced: &quot;Everyone in the world can read except me. I want to know how to read now!&quot; <br/>\nOh. I was basically stunned. I thought she was reading just fine. Beginning to pick out words, etc. But she was not satisfied! She wanted a textbook and that was final! So we went online and looked at a number of choices. You know there are a ton. And we ended up buying your choice -- 100 easy lessons. <br/>\nTurns out she didn&#39;t need the first third of the book because she already read some. She did the middle third and then could read on her own. Which was the point, it turned out. And so we never did the last third but she has pretty much lived at the library ever since. :)<br/>\nBut do you see the difference? I didn&#39;t suggest that textbook or any textbook. I didn&#39;t schedule the times she would do the reading in the textbook. I didn&#39;t say how much of it she should do or that she needed to finish it.<br/>\nShe had a need and I tried to help her reach her goal. And she did. <br/>\nEvery map and poster and activity and thing that might look schoolish from the outside has a similar story behind it here. <br/>\nExcept for poor DS. He had to endure my learning curve early on -- I searched through our state&#39;s standards and made flash cards and all kinds of nonsense for about the first 6 months of our hsing. Shudder! :)<br/>\nBut he survived and both he and DD are wonderful teens now.  DD has finished the online courses she chose to do the past couple of years and has decided she wants to go to the public high school next fall. (DH is not thrilled but we are trying to be supportive.) DS has his own interests -- reads online incessantly, all sorts of things, games and works out and eats (I&#39;m thinking his Tae Kwon Do coach should subsidize his food bill :) ). He has no interest in institutional schooling.<br/>\nI think they are both at a wonderful age! They don&#39;t need to have anything figured out  (although DD is a planner) and they are enjoying themselves with their chosen interests and friends and are growing and learning. But not because I insisted on any of it. I think they are happy and positive kids (but don&#39;t get DS started on politics -- we have raised a skeptic, if not a cynic . . . ) because they are given the time to figure themselves out and didn&#39;t, and still don&#39;t, have my agenda imposed on them. Or the neighbors&#39;.<br/>\nUnschooling is about letting go of a lot of the worries about keeping up and being in step with all the other kids and families. It&#39;s about a lot of things. And it&#39;s not for everyone. But if anecdotes help, take mine and add them to the pile. :)<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m afraid of is I&#39;ll be doing what I think is &quot;Unschooling&quot; and my kids won&#39;t know stuff they need and everyone else who is making these grand promises about how the kids learn naturally is actually spending tons of time doing educational stuff just making it fun and saying it&#39;s child-led, when really the parents are spending hours a week reading books on how to teach your kids stuff in the &quot;unschooling&quot; way - which is just another method of teaching if you&#39;re still trying to get them to do multiplication and such. Ya know what I mean? Because I see my kid backsliding to below what she knew in kindergarten in math and writing, but she can tell you all about teen sit-coms and pop music.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":220041937,"authorName":"Heather","from":"Heather &lt;hbmccarty@...&gt;","profile":"heathermccarty1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Hi New Member","postDate":"1245499875","msgId":40509,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRBM0NEMUUzLjgwODAxMDBAdHdjbnkucnIuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGgxaDJmaStqbTNkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGgxaDJmaStqbTNkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40507,"nextInTopic":40512,"prevInTime":40508,"nextInTime":40510,"topicId":40468,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I find there is a lot of variety here locally too amongst people who call themselves unschoolers.

My son fairly recently came to me with a list of 20 things he <br/>\nwanted to do and/or get.

We have a human body poster in the bathroom hanging over the toilet.  This gets a LOT of use with 3 boys standing several times a day.  They REALLY like it.  One thing I have is a giant white board in the dining room.  I have the alphabet and numbers on it.  I also have there bank account registers written on it.  Milo is 4, he really likes to write and type but often forgets letters so it&#39;s easy for me to point to the letter he needs.  I can also write out sentences he wants to type out instead of spelling them one letter at a time.  We also write plans on it.  That has more to do with my goldfish like memory though.

And I see what you mean.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now she&#39;s transitioning from &quot;I&#39;m going to be a pop star&quot; which frustrated me because the lessons were expensive and she never did her practice the music teacher gave her so didn&#39;t really progress much (except maybe to learning that being a pop star is more work than she wants to do!) to being obsessed with Taekwondo - she bought 9 books on it at a local thrift store and read one on the way home and has lessons 4 times a week.  I doubt her interest will stay with taekwondo for long because so far she changes obsessions about once a year, but if it did &quot;stick&quot; she could open a school like her teacher is doing now, and what she&#39;d need to know would be the taekwondo stuff, with hardly any &quot;science&quot; or &quot;math&quot; other than what she&#39;d be using.  And she&#39;ll always know she can break a board, flip a grown-up and be fierce.  That&#39;s pretty cool stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you&#39;re the &quot;normal&quot; for homeschooling then?  Because I do read Holt but the books by him I pick up are all about how to use life to teach kids stuff, and the emphasis is on teaching.  I feel sneaky getting a board game on the states or presidents and pretending I want to play it because it will be &quot;fun&quot; to get them to learn that stuff.  I&#39;d rather be honest and just tell them I&#39;d like them to know whatever because it&#39;s useful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou and Faith and some others say even that isn&#39;t unschooling, so is there a name for the people who bend over backwards to find and do all the &quot;fun&quot; educational stuff, where the goal is still making sure their kids are learning stuff?  Would that be relaxed homeschooling (I don&#39;t see how it can be relaxed when the parents have to put so much work into it!)? I&#39;m not usually into labels but for the sake of this conversation it seems like it would be very useful to be able to differentiate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about this last night after my post (I hope I didn&#39;t sound mean, I&#39;m just frustrated at trying to figure this out).  I really feel that I don&#39;t have a choice in the matter.  I can see that trying to force learning on an unwilling pupil isn&#39;t going to work nor will it stick.  Also I&#39;m too honest with my kids to be getting up hours earlier in the morning to find &quot;fun&quot; activities that will reinforce their math skills or get them to learn something.  The traits I want for them the most are for them to be able to know themselves, know what they want, and live a full life, with many and varied interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;haecklers&quot; &lt;haecklers@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yeah, ok but here&#39;s what I don&#39;t get.

Ya know what I mean?~~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Which is exactly why we don&#39;t do stuff in an &quot;unschooling way&quot;, we actually live a life free of schooling and coerced lessons. All the time. Day in and day out. Have for many, many years with a 19y.o., 15y.o., 12y.o. and 8y.o. that are learning just fine without all that and who can all (with the exception of the 8y.o.) read and spell without lessons.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your fears about unschooling are common though...many of us had to question and analyze the same things before we realized how we had the school blinders on!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I believe that multiplication and reading and all of those things we consider &quot;basic&quot; skills are really EASY to learn. School makes you believe otherwise but if a skill is &quot;basic&quot; it means that it is common in a society. What a &quot;basic&quot; skill is to an American will not be the same for another culture. Basic means common. Common means that it surrounds us and is used often. If something is common and used often then people will pick it up with ease, by living in the society in which they are born.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~~Because I see my kid backsliding to below what she knew in kindergarten in math and writing, but she can tell you all about teen sit-coms and pop music.~~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She can learn all the math and writing she&#39;ll ever need in life through teen sit-coms and pop music. Whatever interest a person has includes math and reading and all sorts of &quot;basic&quot; skills. You&#39;re still valuing schoolish looking skills above other skills. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is no &quot;backsliding&quot; once you let go of comparing kids to other kids, which tells you nothing important.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The skills that help me succeed in my career today are all about makeup and fashion and art and color. Do you believe you can guess what your child will end up pursuing passionately later in life? If so, prepare her for THAT. But good luck, because no human being can possibly guess what another human needs for next year or in five years, much less ten or more years down the line. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The best preparation for a life well-lived (because that IS the ultimate goal, isn&#39;t it?) is to fill it with rich experiences and connections. Rich experiences don&#39;t come from one person extracting information or pushing another person to &quot;learn&quot;. Rich experiences come from standing side by side with someone and digging into something fun or fascinating or moving or beautiful. THAT&#39;S my goal as a parent...to make their days memorable. The learning happens as a side benefit. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t take my word for it (even with four children who are up-ending all that mythology about teaching and school) because there are literally hundreds of unschoolers (many of whom I&#39;ve met and stayed with) who can tell you it works. But if you&#39;re looking for schoolish results, unschooling isn&#39;t the best path.

Could change tomorrow. <br/>\n<br/>\n~~I guess what I&#39;m afraid of is I&#39;ll be doing what I think is &quot;Unschooling&quot; and my kids won&#39;t know stuff they need and everyone else who is making these grand promises about how the kids learn naturally is actually spending tons of time doing educational stuff just making it fun and saying it&#39;s child-led, when really the parents are spending hours a week reading books on how to teach your kids stuff in the &quot;unschooling&quot; way - which is just another method of teaching if you&#39;re still trying to get them to do multiplication and such.  Ya know what I mean?~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is exactly why we don&#39;t do stuff in an &quot;unschooling way&quot;, we actually live a life free of schooling and coerced lessons. All the time. Day in and day out. Have for many, many years with a 19y.o., 15y.o., 12y.o. and 8y.o. that are learning just fine without all that and who can all (with the exception of the 8y.o.) read and spell without lessons.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour fears about unschooling are common though...many of us had to question and analyze the same things before we realized how we had the school blinders on!<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that multiplication and reading and all of those things we consider &quot;basic&quot; skills are really EASY to learn. School makes you believe otherwise but if a skill is &quot;basic&quot; it means that it is common in a society. What a &quot;basic&quot; skill is to an American will not be the same for another culture. Basic means common. Common means that it surrounds us and is used often. If something is common and used often then people will pick it up with ease, by living in the society in which they are born.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Because I see my kid backsliding to below what she knew in kindergarten in math and writing, but she can tell you all about teen sit-coms and pop music.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nShe can learn all the math and writing she&#39;ll ever need in life through teen sit-coms and pop music. Whatever interest a person has includes math and reading and all sorts of &quot;basic&quot; skills. You&#39;re still valuing schoolish looking skills above other skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no &quot;backsliding&quot; once you let go of comparing kids to other kids, which tells you nothing important.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe skills that help me succeed in my career today are all about makeup and fashion and art and color. Do you believe you can guess what your child will end up pursuing passionately later in life? If so, prepare her for THAT. But good luck, because no human being can possibly guess what another human needs for next year or in five years, much less ten or more years down the line. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best preparation for a life well-lived (because that IS the ultimate goal, isn&#39;t it?) is to fill it with rich experiences and connections. Rich experiences don&#39;t come from one person extracting information or pushing another person to &quot;learn&quot;. Rich experiences come from standing side by side with someone and digging into something fun or fascinating or moving or beautiful. THAT&#39;S my goal as a parent...to make their days memorable. The learning happens as a side benefit. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t take my word for it (even with four children who are up-ending all that mythology about teaching and school) because there are literally hundreds of unschoolers (many of whom I&#39;ve met and stayed with) who can tell you it works. But if you&#39;re looking for schoolish results, unschooling isn&#39;t the best path. If you&#39;re choosing to focus on living well and creating amazing memories instead of stressing about multiplication or reading, keep on reading.:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nradicalunschooling.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Hi New Member","postDate":"1245469988","msgId":40496,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkzNDAxNC45MjcxOC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGgxaGhndCs5MGQ3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGgxaGhndCs5MGQ3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40495,"nextInTopic":40497,"prevInTime":40495,"nextInTime":40497,"topicId":40468,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yeah, ok but here s what I don t get.

THere isn&#39;t unschooling stuff and educational stuff if you unschool. Unschooling is living life and trusting that learning happens ALL the time. You don&#39;t have to view things as &quot;educational&quot; or not...it&#39;s all just different kinds of things to learn about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way Holt described unschooling was about trusting the natural learning process to unfold by simply being interested and curious in the world around us. It was about parents assisting their children with whatever they were into at the moment, rather than deciding what they want their children to be interested in. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t mean parents don&#39;t swirl new ideas, activities etc... into the mix. Kids won&#39;t know what&#39;s out there unless you share, but unschooling is about trusting that your ideas, activities etc...aren&#39;t more important than something else they might be into. It&#39;s trusting that they are learning all the time. It&#39;s having FUN together and focusing on relationships not what is &quot;educational&quot; or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you know people who&#39;s children are simply into more formal kinds of learning, without any pressure from the adults and so you assumed that&#39;s what all unschoolers look like.:) Maybe you hang out with people who DO curriculum and call it unschooling. I don&#39;t know. To me, unschooling is NOT schooling. In any form unless the child chooses it. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery unschooling household looks completely different of course, so it&#39;s harder to say &quot;here&#39;s what it looks like&quot;. It looks different for every unique family that embraces it. But the ideas/philosophies remain the same....that humans learn best when they are free to explore anything and everything that interests them, all the time. Lessons and teaching run the risk of damaging that natural process.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nradicalunschooling.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244317154,"authorName":"swissarmy_wife","from":"&quot;swissarmy_wife&quot; &lt;heatherbean@...&gt;","profile":"swissarmy_wife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Hi New Member","postDate":"1245463065","msgId":40488,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgxaGZtcCt1bnQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGgxaDJvaStqanVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40486,"nextInTopic":40489,"prevInTime":40487,"nextInTime":40489,"topicId":40468,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ******A couple of good free resources are Sandra Dodd s website.  a plethora of information.  www.sandradodd.com/unschooling and also","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-911950324\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;haecklers&quot; &lt;haecklers@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d love for you to direct me to some good books on the subject.

If a child chooses those formal learning experiences, without any pressure or expectations from anyone, that&#39;s a different matter. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like a more relaxed style of homeschooling you all do...I hope you&#39;ll stick around and learn about unschooling.

I&#39;m a mother of two wonderful kids - son turning 7 this weekend and daughter, 9 going on 15.  We&#39;re kind sort of unschooling - did mostly unschooling the last school year but then I felt she was not challenging herself enough, her spelling became atrocious, handwriting was very bad, and I never let go completely of the math but didn&#39;t do much other than tell her I really wanted her to learn the times tables this year (she did - using a game).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the coming year, I&#39;m thinking of asking her to do 4 math problems a day just so she doesn&#39;t forget how to do basic subtraction and such. Also to write in a &quot;Friday Journal&quot; - kind of a photo album with narrative of what cool thing happened that week, so she can work a bit on her handwriting but also have a keepsake to treasure later. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is, she was in public school for awhile and really hated it; now she doesn&#39;t want to do much at all that smacks of school and I fear its keeping her from even learning naturally.  We&#39;re going into her third year of homeschooling, after 2 years of public school.  She actually didn&#39;t hate public school that much, but now she acts like it was the worst thing ever, and I wonder if she feels a little odd going against the current of what most kids are doing and is covering some defensiveness about it.  We had a couple of discussions about the pros and cons of homeschooling, but I&#39;m not militant about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is taking to unschooling like a duck to water. He&#39;s way ahead in science (loves physics!) but a bit behind in reading and won&#39;t hold a pencil or write at all, tho he can sign his first name.
