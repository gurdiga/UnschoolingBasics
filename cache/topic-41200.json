I came to a point where conferences are mostly overwhelming for me so I only went to one last year and will most likely go to zero next year. Only small, localish stuff. Needs change. Maybe this is a chance to re-direct?<br/>\n<br/>\nI could be totally off-base, but I think there are different times in our lives where going outward feels really good and then times when we need to go inward more. I&#39;ve felt less and less invigorated by conferences and more overwhelmed and exhausted. I think part of that may stem from having an amazing group of local friends and lots of opportunities for smaller get-togethers.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nradicalunschooling.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: post unschooling conference feelings","postDate":"1251935725","msgId":41219,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg3bjBsZCtub20zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg3bGo5Yytrb2k5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41200,"nextInTopic":41222,"prevInTime":41218,"nextInTime":41220,"topicId":41200,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... **************** That could be.
