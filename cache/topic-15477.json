And you&#39;re right... <br/>\n  I have totally forgotten about the cool non-parent types that we do <br/>\n  know.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I live in central Minnesota, about two hours north of the Twin <br/>\n  Cities, and an hour from the northwestern suburbs. I&#39;ve gotten <br/>\n  together with other unschoolers from far away a couple of times, and <br/>\n  have driven to the cities for Theatrix (a theater group that some <br/>\n  unschoolers we met are part of), but we do like our country life. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I also read the unschoolingmn list, and have my own group seeking <br/>\n  out other secular homeschoolers in the Mille Lacs Lake area that we <br/>\n  live in. I now know two hsers in the area, and it took a while to <br/>\n  find each other! We keep plugging away, though. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I suppose we&#39;ll just have to travel more, and turn the other cheek <br/>\n  with the stuff said.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks again, <br/>\n  Dawn O. <br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ren Allen&quot; <br/>\n  &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;My concern is that our culture is so control-oriented that my<br/>\n  &gt; friends&#39; approach to raising their kids is accepted unquestioningly<br/>\n  &gt; by others and supported by everyone they know (so it must be<br/>\n  &gt; right?), so they continue it and expect me to practice it.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Our culture is very control-oriented towards children.<br/>\n  &gt; RU is SO counter-culture that way!:)<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; But when I see the stress in most families, the situations they<br/>\n  &gt; constantly deal with that I DON&#39;T, I&#39;m so relieved that we chose<br/>\n  &gt; freedom over control.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; You can&#39;t help the judgement that may come your way.
