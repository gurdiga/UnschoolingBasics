I<br/>\ncan be sitting quietly knitting and look up to see one of them working on a<br/>\npuzzle or constructing something with legos or mastering a new DDR<br/>\nroutine/dance/whatever you call it.  Recently I was busy making some cards<br/>\nfor my stamping class I go to and one of the kids said, &quot;Want to do<br/>\nsomething with paper, too.&quot;  I told them that there was tons of paper on the<br/>\nart shelves and in the paper box.  Next thing I know I had paper cranes<br/>\nflying from the kitchen door frame!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope everyone has an art shelf in their homes.  We love our art shelf.<br/>\nIt&#39;s filled with paper, crayons, pens, markers, glue, stickers, paints,<br/>\nbrushes, clay, books modelling stuff, whatever we find to add to it.  It&#39;s<br/>\nfree and open to be played with at any time.  I&#39;ve asked the kids just to<br/>\ntry to keep the area that they create in tidy and have made no limitations<br/>\non their creativity other than that.  We have had an art gallery down the<br/>\nhall and designer love letters (as well as the aforementioned paper crane<br/>\ndisplay).  One morning I got up and Keon was painting paper plates.  He&#39;d<br/>\ncarefully laid out newspaper from the recycling bin on the table and was<br/>\nhappily creating - before breakfast.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m about to put up butcher paper down the hallway.

So it is it finding balance between the two that I<br/>\nshould<br/>\nstrive for, or just devote my self to helping them be interested in their<br/>\ninterests?***<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, devote yourself to helping them do the things that interest them. <br/>\nOur kids will only be with us a short time.  We don&#39;t have all the time<br/>\nin the world to become interested parents.  If we wait a year to be<br/>\ninvolved with our twelve year old we&#39;ll have missed it.  He won&#39;t be<br/>\ntwelve next year and we&#39;ll never get that chance again.   If  we put our<br/>\ninterests ahead of our kids we&#39;ll run out of time with our kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that doesn&#39;t mean never pursuing our own interests.  It doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nto be one or the other.  It just means while we&#39;re parents of kids at<br/>\nhome they should be our focus because the other things we want to do can<br/>\nbe done lightly, without total immersion, without irretrievable loss or<br/>\ncan wait.  Our kids can&#39;t.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, unschooling parents do have to show an interest in their kids.  <br/>\nEven if what the kids are doing doesn&#39;t particularly interest us, it&#39;s<br/>\nvital to be interested in their joy!   We really should be devoted to<br/>\nthat!   But part of how our kids will find and live their own interests<br/>\ncomes from our example.  So when we find something interesting, we can<br/>\nshare that with them.  When we have a passion we can pursue it.  If you<br/>\nlove Tibet then by all means read about it and watch movies and buy<br/>\nTibetan wool and make traditional Tibetan rugs and whatever blows your<br/>\nskirt up, but save the year long isolation in the Tibetan monastery until<br/>\nyour kids are happily occupied in their adult lives. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it won&#39;t look like balance; like your kids on one side with their<br/>\npassions and interests and you other side with your passions and<br/>\ninterests.  It will look more like unschooling, with all of you on the<br/>\nsame side standing in the big wide world and you holding the keys to the<br/>\ncar. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n***Also, of all the books on unschooling that have been recommended,<br/>\ncould you<br/>\nsuggest &quot;the one&quot; to start with.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like Rue&#39;s book, &quot;Parenting a Free Child: An Unschooled Life,&quot;<br/>\navailable here: www.freechild.info <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244909672,"authorName":"freepsgal","from":"&quot;freepsgal&quot; &lt;freepsgal@...&gt;","profile":"freepsgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Help--I hate homeschooling!","postDate":"1148862826","msgId":13753,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU1ZGZoYStnaDkwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PE5EQkJKTUlQRElJSkRQQ0NORkFCQ0VITkVDQUEucHJlc3NtYW5tQGNvYXN0YWxwcm9kdWN0cy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":13743,"nextInTopic":13762,"prevInTime":13752,"nextInTime":13754,"topicId":13618,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The first time I read it, I agreed with some of <br/>\nthe stuff but sort of skimmed over other stuff.  As soon as I <br/>\nfinished the book though, I went right back to the beginning and <br/>\nstarted it again, taking time to read it cover to cover and <br/>\ndiscussing many of the comments with my DH.  We both learned so <br/>\nmuch!!  My other long-time favorite is Alison McKee&#39;s Homeschooling <br/>\nOur Children Unschooling Ourselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I like both of those books is because they really come at <br/>\nit from the parents questioning.  Too many people think that <br/>\nunschooling has to do with just not using formal curriculum with <br/>\nchildren, but I&#39;ve been learning that there&#39;s so much more to <br/>\nunschooling.  It affects every aspect of our life, especially the <br/>\nway we parent our children.  I&#39;ve become a much more patient mother, <br/>\nand usually the one with a calm reasoning attitude in nearly <br/>\neverything we do.  That&#39;s so out of character for me, but that&#39;s how <br/>\nmuch unschooling has affected my life.  I like to think that my <br/>\nchildren are happier and better off because I&#39;m focusing on <br/>\nunschooling my DH and myself.  I don&#39;t need to un-school the kids, <br/>\nbut us, and the rest just seems to fall into place!<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":182292076,"authorName":"Marie Pressman","from":"&quot;Marie Pressman&quot; &lt;pressmanm@...&gt;","profile":"pressmanm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Help--I hate homeschooling!","postDate":"1148829701","msgId":13743,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE5EQkJKTUlQRElJSkRQQ0NORkFCQ0VITkVDQUEucHJlc3NtYW5tQGNvYXN0YWxwcm9kdWN0cy5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwNTI4LjA3MTYxOC4yOTY4LjEuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":13734,"nextInTopic":13753,"prevInTime":13742,"nextInTime":13744,"topicId":13618,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We had all kinds of <br/>\nparty food that we don&#39;t normally have in the house: potato chips, <br/>\ncake, brownies, etc. Not because these things aren&#39;t allowed, just <br/>\nbecause none of us particularly likes them as everyday foods. When my <br/>\ndd wants chips, I get her her own small bag of chips. When she wants <br/>\ncookies I make her cookies or we buy some. But it&#39;s totally up to her <br/>\nto ask for these things when the mood strikes.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately I&#39;ve been &quot;unfooding&quot; myself, letting myself eat whatever I want <br/>\nwhenever I want to remove the power of the forbidden foods from my <br/>\nchildhood. I started out eating lots of cookies for breakfast with my <br/>\ncoffee, but the pendulum has swung back to the middle over time, and I <br/>\nhave been eating a healthy varied diet and very content with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told myself it was a special occasion and I could eat as much of all <br/>\nof these &quot;naughty&quot; foods as I wanted to. But it backfired because the <br/>\nsweets were too sweet and the chips were too salty. So somewhere along <br/>\nthe line (since being denied all sugar as a child and then bingeing on <br/>\nthese sorts of foods as a teen) I&#39;ve lost my taste for extremely fatty <br/>\nand sugary foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters, having been given free reign all their lives with food <br/>\nwere excited about the cake and such, but didn&#39;t actually eat any of <br/>\nit. I made a delightfully disgusting concoction for the kids with <br/>\nbrownies oreos and gummy worms all mashed up and served with a trowel <br/>\nin a flower pot. My dd took a few bites (maybe only one) and walked <br/>\naway to go play. My husband and I looked at each other over the picnic <br/>\ntable and I asked, &quot;Would you have ever walked away from a bowl of <br/>\nsomething like that as a kid?&quot; His answer, &quot;Never in a million years.&quot; <br/>\nAnd we&#39;ve both struggled with our weight and are still figuring it out. <br/>\nFood isn&#39;t just food for us, it&#39;s caught up in a complex tangle of <br/>\nemotions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe wanted something better for our daughters, and for us radical <br/>\nunschooling is the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not the whole story, but it&#39;s as much as I have time for at the <br/>\nmoment.
