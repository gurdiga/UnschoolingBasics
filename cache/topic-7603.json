I don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The kids are going stir crazy I&#39;m sure but the mere thought of taking them anywere is sooo overwhelming to me, that we just stay home. They are reacting to my apathy by getting louder, crazier, and angry which makes it harder for me to pull myself up and get out with them. - They being my boys, Jaiden (7), Avery(4), and Garett(14months).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I want to burst out of this way of thinking and feeling, I want to have fun and experience life but, I don&#39;t know how to start. This all started in MI, we ended up housebound for a year and a half and everyone (kids and dh and I) were all depressed and really didn&#39;t like being there, we hoped coming back to SoCal would be enough of a jolt to wake us all up and it seems to have worked for all but me, I still fell so stuck....<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Has anything like this happened for anyone?

I have<br/>\nbeen home schooling my children from the start (ages 9, 7 1/2, 5, 2<br/>\n1/2). My oldest has always bucked &quot;pencil-and-paper&quot; learning, and<br/>\nbecause he and I are both strong-willed, this has led to some battles<br/>\nof will, which I would love to have done with! I have done some<br/>\nreading on unschooling over the years and always been attracted to it,<br/>\nbut have found it hard to make that leap into the unknown,<br/>\nparticularly as I know I will have no support around me for such an<br/>\napproach. I am also a recovering public school teacher (my years in<br/>\nthe system led to my decision to home school), which makes it<br/>\ndifficult for me to get away from the notion of &quot;basic skills,&quot;<br/>\nespecially as I always feel anxious about the prospect of them<br/>\npossibly going to school someday (not that I &quot;plan&quot; to send them, but<br/>\nthey do talk about going to high school some day) and being miles<br/>\nbehind everybody in math skills, spelling, writing etc. If this is a<br/>\nplace where gentle advice, encouragement and support are offered, I<br/>\nwould like to join your circle. I have been on other unschooling<br/>\nwebsites where I have encountered thinking as dogmatic and rigid as in<br/>\nany school board office. I am looking for an atmosphere of mutual<br/>\nacceptance, respectful discussion and openness to various points of<br/>\nview. I would love to hear from those of you wise, experienced<br/>\nunschoolers who have made a similar transition (or just put to rest<br/>\nthe anxiety of &quot;having children whose skills measure up&quot;). <br/>\nJust putting my big toe into the water,<br/>\nTamara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7604,"nextTopicId":7798}}
