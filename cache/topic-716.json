I feel like an awful parent...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah no....I understand. They&#39;re totally exhausting to be around. When Jalen (3) falls asleep, I start to breathe deeper automatically. It&#39;s like I can finally relax.<br/>\nThe advantage I have with him, is he still breastfeeds. I can&#39;t say enough good things about long-term breastfeeding, especially with a challenging child. It keeps those warm feelings available more often.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remove Jalen from the room a lot right now. I don&#39;t think anyone else should have to put up with being hurt, or having their peace disturbed constantly...so I take him with me and we sit together in my room. I offered some books the other day, but he was pissed that he&#39;d been removed from the rest of the kids and threw them across the room stating very clearly &quot;ME NO WANT BOOKS!&quot;<br/>\nSigh...ya just keep trying.<br/>\nLast night, he was having leg pains. Those nights are really stressful for me, because there&#39;s not much I can do and he screams really loud. Rubbing them upsets him more, so I usually wrap them with Ace bandages and try to nurse him (he nurses, then screams, nurses a bit more, then screams and so on).<br/>\nHe finally settled in for a deep sleep somewhere in the middle of the night...the Chammomila may have helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I do belive in setting boundaries, not allowing others to be harmed by these explosive children (as much as possible) and removal from a setting may be an effective tool. But it takes a lot of patience, nurturing and deep breathing. Just know, you aren&#39;t alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":710,"nextTopicId":729}}
