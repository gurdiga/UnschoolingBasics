He was given a couple <br/>\nof Barbie dolls and a Barbie car as gifts . He specifically had <br/>\nthese items on his &#39;gift list&#39; and the giver knows my son enjoys <br/>\nplaying with the Barbies. While the gifts were being unwrapped a <br/>\ncouple of children at the party happened to make remarks such <br/>\nas &quot;who would buy Barbies for a BOY&quot; ?? Then others chimed in with <br/>\nsimilar remarks . Some giggling followed and my son became <br/>\nembarrased. I tried not to be too upset by it- but I felt bad that <br/>\nmy son was embarrased, especially at his birthday party. This has <br/>\nnever been an issue in our home before and we&#39;ve never discussed <br/>\ntoys in terms of gender specificity. Also, my son really loved the <br/>\nBarbie gifts but he quickly covered them and put them aside because <br/>\nof these remarks. The rest of the party went on happily and <br/>\nuneventfully. When we got home my husband and I gave our birthday <br/>\nboy more gifts, several of which were more Barbies and clothes for <br/>\nBarbies. My son loved them and proceeded to spend the rest of the <br/>\nevening playing with them. The next morning we were getting ready <br/>\nto go someplace with friends. My son asked to bring a Barbie along. <br/>\nI replied yes. Then a few moments later he remembered we would be <br/>\ntraveling in the same car with our friends...he suddenly said &quot;oh, <br/>\nmaybe I won&#39;t bring a Barbie then&quot; ... I asked why to which he <br/>\nreplied &#39;nevermind&#39; and he looked embarrased . I knew immediately <br/>\nthat he had (sadly) been deeply affected by the comments made at his <br/>\nparty. Later that day I tried to talk with him a bit more about the <br/>\nsubject, to be supportive of him and respectful of his emotions , <br/>\nand explain that he can play with whatever toys he enjoys playing <br/>\nwith. I felt however, that I couldn&#39;t seem to find quite the right <br/>\nwords to help him through this. I want him to enjoy whatever toys <br/>\nhe likes. He loves fashion and the Barbies for him are all about <br/>\nthe fashion and choosing outfits for them. Anyway, a couple of <br/>\nweeks has passed since the birthday incident. He has played with the <br/>\ndolls and there had not been any further discussion on the issue. <br/>\nThen yesterday he was having some friends over to the house for a <br/>\nplaydate and he remembered he had left his Barbies and Barbie cars <br/>\nout on the floor of his room. He asked me if he could lock the <br/>\nBarbie stuff in a closet. I asked why and again he turned pink and <br/>\naverted his gaze and I know he was embarrased. He did not want his <br/>\nfriends to know he was playing with the Barbies (these are not the <br/>\nfriends who even made the comments at his party). I tried to be <br/>\nsupportive of his wishes and helped him pack his Barbies into a box <br/>\nand we put them in a closet. But I have to say I was feeling very <br/>\nsad (and somewhat frustrated), and at a loss for what to say (if <br/>\nanything) to help him with his emotions about this. He got such joy <br/>\nout of dressing the dolls and designing just the right outfit for <br/>\nthem with the matching bag and shoes etc., Now he still plays with <br/>\nthem, but he feels he must hide them from his friends for fear of <br/>\nbeing made fun of. Last year he was into Legos and Hotwheels - this <br/>\nyear it happens to be Barbies and fashion design. I think he would <br/>\nbe a most talented fashion designer and I don&#39;t want him to avoid <br/>\nexploring this avenue for fear of ridicule. What does a parent say <br/>\nto a child in this situation ?

Really.

I thought that since he was clearly affected by what another child had said (and because it wasn&#39;t a topic we&#39;d ever had need to discuss prior to this occasion) perhaps we needed further dialogue on the subject.  My son is a child who feels very deeply and passionately about everything in his world. He is  very emotionally sensitive and at the time of the &quot;taking Barbies on our outing&#39; discussion my instincts told me that to just say &#39;ok&#39; would be to pass up an opportunity for him to ask me about something that was bothering him.   .   Are you suggesting I might have just said &#39;ok&#39; and then not said any more on the subject (unless asked by my son)?  In that scenario, would it better just to wait for him to come to me with question<br/>\ns rather than to be confrontational and make him feel the need to explain his actions?  I recognize that I  do tend to confront all issues in my  own world head on  because I am uncomfortable having unresolved issues and I find it works best for me to get uncomfortable issues &#39;out in the open&#39;  .  I also  understand and accept that not everyone deals with their own issues in this way however.....  just wondering if  I should trust that my seven year old son will <br/>\nbe able work through this on his own or if I need to somehow facilitate dialogue between us....(?)<br/>\nThanks again for your input <br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] embarrased about dolls","postDate":"1173616081","msgId":22090,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDNzlCODE1LTcxOUMtNEFFOS05RUQyLUUwRDBDQjEzOTNDNEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVzdmY3Yys0ajh0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVzdmY3Yys0ajh0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22083,"nextInTopic":22094,"prevInTime":22089,"nextInTime":22091,"topicId":22081,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He was given a couple <br/>\nof Barbie dolls and a Barbie car as gifts . He specifically had <br/>\nthese items on his &#39;gift list&#39; and the giver knows my son enjoys <br/>\nplaying with the Barbies. While the gifts were being unwrapped a <br/>\ncouple of children at the party happened to make remarks such <br/>\nas &quot;who would buy Barbies for a BOY&quot; ?? Then others chimed in with <br/>\nsimilar remarks . Some giggling followed and my son became <br/>\nembarrased. I tried not to be too upset by it- but I felt bad that <br/>\nmy son was embarrased, especially at his birthday party. This has <br/>\nnever been an issue in our home before and we&#39;ve never discussed <br/>\ntoys in terms of gender specificity. Also, my son really loved the <br/>\nBarbie gifts but he quickly covered them and put them aside because <br/>\nof these remarks. The rest of the party went on happily and <br/>\nuneventfully. When we got home my husband and I gave our birthday <br/>\nboy more gifts, several of which were more Barbies and clothes for <br/>\nBarbies. My son loved them and proceeded to spend the rest of the <br/>\nevening playing with them. The next morning we were getting ready <br/>\nto go someplace with friends. My son asked to bring a Barbie along. <br/>\nI replied yes. Then a few moments later he remembered we would be <br/>\ntraveling in the same car with our friends...he suddenly said &quot;oh, <br/>\nmaybe I won&#39;t bring a Barbie then&quot; ... I asked why to which he <br/>\nreplied &#39;nevermind&#39; and he looked embarrased . I knew immediately <br/>\nthat he had (sadly) been deeply affected by the comments made at his <br/>\nparty. Later that day I tried to talk with him a bit more about the <br/>\nsubject, to be supportive of him and respectful of his emotions , <br/>\nand explain that he can play with whatever toys he enjoys playing <br/>\nwith. I felt however, that I couldn&#39;t seem to find quite the right <br/>\nwords to help him through this. I want him to enjoy whatever toys <br/>\nhe likes. He loves fashion and the Barbies for him are all about <br/>\nthe fashion and choosing outfits for them. Anyway, a couple of <br/>\nweeks has passed since the birthday incident. He has played with the <br/>\ndolls and there had not been any further discussion on the issue. <br/>\nThen yesterday he was having some friends over to the house for a <br/>\nplaydate and he remembered he had left his Barbies and Barbie cars <br/>\nout on the floor of his room. He asked me if he could lock the <br/>\nBarbie stuff in a closet. I asked why and again he turned pink and <br/>\naverted his gaze and I know he was embarrased.
