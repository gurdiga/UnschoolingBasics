When he wasn&#39;t sitting for the sculpture, he&#39;d tie his hair back<br/>\nwith black or navy blue ties, set low at the nape of his neck a la<br/>\nThomas Jefferson. (though no one would think he was a woman with the<br/>\nbeard and his 6&#39; 300 lb frame) Might your sons be willing to tie their<br/>\nhair back a bit, and you can make an offhand comment about how your kids<br/>\nare trying out the Thomas Jefferson hair style? Or, as someone said,<br/>\nwhen there&#39;s a comment made, clearly and specifically say Yes, I really<br/>\nlove HIS hair when it&#39;s long - it&#39;s so soft and silky. Then &quot;pass the<br/>\nbean dip&quot; - change the subject so they have to work really hard to make<br/>\nthose rude continuing comments. Or perhaps go all out and see if they<br/>\nwant to dye their hair in stripes or something really &quot;in your face&quot;. I<br/>\njust noticed that DS&#39; hair is down to his neckline - it&#39;ll probably get<br/>\neven longer since neither of my guys like cutting their hair in the<br/>\nwinter - it keeps them warm.

But his hair isn&#39;t as long as <br/>\nmine. As soon as I&#39;m shaving you won&#39;t mistake me!&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe IS (for the first time) discussing cutting it though---short! We&#39;ve <br/>\ntalked about Locks of Love. I should go google them for info. It&#39;ll be <br/>\na big deal if he were to cut it. We&#39;ll see. He wavers weekly on whether <br/>\nto do it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway---back to the questions: I always correct the...um...admirer &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nand say &quot;he&quot; or &quot;him&quot; or &quot;my son&quot; when he&#39;s referred to as a girl. <br/>\nDuncan doesn&#39;t always---depends on whether it&#39;s a one time deal or <br/>\nwhether the stranger is actually chatting. Like---waiters he&#39;ll correct <br/>\nbecause he&#39;ll be talking with them again while we eat. Little old <br/>\nladies in check-out?---it depends.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve talked a lot about why people make the mistake--and it&#39;s more <br/>\ncommon with older people. My brother had long hair when he was 7-14, I <br/>\nthink. But that was waaay back in the 60&#39;s & 70&#39;s! It WAS uncommon to <br/>\nsee long hair on a boy in the South. Hippie freak! &lt;g&gt; Now it&#39;s rather <br/>\ncommon. (At least at unschooling conferences! &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys and I talk about being different or outside the norm. A LOT. <br/>\nWhen you take a step like that, it&#39;s best to learn to deal with the <br/>\nissues that come along with it. Duncan knows that cutting his hair <br/>\nwould reduce those comments. Right now, the length of his hair is worth <br/>\nit. So he&#39;s really sweet and tolerant when mistaken for a girl. &quot;It&#39;s <br/>\nOK. Some of my best friends are girls.&quot; is one of his comebacks. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with unschooling, really. It&#39;s outside the norm. I am VERY <br/>\npro-unschooling and anti-school, so I don&#39;t have any problem defending <br/>\nour lifestyle in public or with strangers. But it works to my advantage <br/>\nwhen we may be the only unschoolers someone meets to be the BEST <br/>\nexamples of unschooling/mindful parenting possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for Duncan to be kind and respectful about comments on/responses to <br/>\nhis hair length is, to me, better than to be aggressive and rude back. <br/>\nI think Duncan has that down-pat! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.

I have heard positive reports about enzymes; however,<br/>\nevidently, they cause some people a LOT of abdominal discomfort and<br/>\ndistress. A couple of the links are about alternative resources which<br/>\nare FAR FAR FAR from consent based interventions. So, consider the<br/>\ninvasiveness of some of the suggestions. It is all quite overwhelming<br/>\nto determine what helps, except to observe and solicit your child&#39;s<br/>\ninput, imo.

A major component to unschooling is<br/>\ntrusting that our children will develop and learn in the direction and<br/>\nrate to which they need. Many behavioral evaluations and labels are<br/>\nbased upon external judgments of a child against some &quot;normal&quot; to<br/>\nwhich unique and passionate people don&#39;t &quot;fit&quot;. Coming to accept and<br/>\ntrust that We Are Exactly Who We Need To Be, helps to diminish our<br/>\nattachment to &quot;expert&#39;s&quot; opinions. <br/>\n<br/>\nHTH, Pat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n         <br/>\n<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

Mariah came to us as a foster child at two months old.  She was malnourished when she came to us, and had pink eye, thrush, horrible colic and stomach reflux.  So you can see where we are going here.......she got off to a horrible start.  And of course six years ago I did not know the things I know now.  And right now she has the horrible yeast overgrowth, and is intolerant to a number of foods.  Yet she is about to be diagnosed with Bipolar, AS, OCD, anxiety disorder, SPD, and Dygraphia.  Like I said the article was dead on.  This is why I am going to try Enzyme Therapy and see if we can improve her digestive system.

Especially when things like the curtains were handmade by me<br/>\nfor our home. I would much rather spend our time enjoying each<br/>\nother, going places, instead of repainting walls, re-sewing curtains<br/>\nand scrubbing floors.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would you think it&#39;s wouldn&#39;t a big thing for others here?   Destruction<br/>\nis not cool.  The suffering of a child is not cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour hand made curtains should not be more important than your daughter.<br/>\nAnd as hard as it might be to see this, the destruction is not a personal<br/>\nattack on you and your curtains.   I see a whole slew of people are posting<br/>\nabout diet and whatnot but regardless of red dye number kazillion your <br/>\ndaughter<br/>\nis trying to communicate with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn eight year old might seem like a big enough person, big enough to behave, <br/>\nbig enough to talk about what&#39;s bothering her,  but eight is young.<br/>\nEight short years on the planet.   Many, many adults cannot communicate <br/>\nwithout anger and it&#39;s unrealistic to<br/>\nexpect that every eight year old should have the skills and ability to<br/>\ncommunicate big emotions through peaceful discussion.  Some kids can.  Some <br/>\ncan&#39;t.  There&#39;s no magic age for insightful, thoughtful communication.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou probably understand there&#39;s no magic age for reading.  Some kids read at <br/>\nfour or five, some kids read at twelve.   There&#39;s no magic age for learning <br/>\nto use the toilet.  Some kid are dry all night at three, some still wet the <br/>\nbed when they&#39;re ten.   There&#39;s not a magic age when our kids have all the <br/>\nskills and abilities to express all their emotions with words.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said it started around the time of, or since your move.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things to think about would be;   Why you moved - Did your daughter<br/>\nwant to move?  What did she leave behind when you moved?   What did she have<br/>\nto give up?  How much time have you had with her since the move?   Could<br/>\nsomeone be hurting her?  How well has she adjusted to your new place?  Do <br/>\nother people in the family have quick tempers.<br/>\nIs she missing a dear friend?  Do her things get thrown away or taken away <br/>\nfrom her as a form of discipline?<br/>\nThese are not necessarily things you need to answer on the list, just things<br/>\nto think about as you try to understand what is causing your daughter so<br/>\nmuch distress.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour daughter does not want to be destructive. She wants to be happy and <br/>\nhave a happy life.   She wants you to &quot;hear&quot; her<br/>\nand it&#39;s your job to figure out what she is trying to tell you.  Don&#39;t take<br/>\nit personally.   The most important thing is not to stop the behavior<br/>\nbecause your tired of ruined curtains or walls or floors.  The most<br/>\nimportant thing should be finding the cause of your daughter&#39;s big emotional<br/>\nturmoil and helping her.   The behaviors will resolve when her needs are<br/>\nmet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when a person feels like too many things about their life are out <br/>\nof their control they find one thing they can control.  Maybe she feels like <br/>\nthe only time she has any power in her life and in your family is when she&#39;s <br/>\nbeing destructive.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you go away with her?  Just with her for four or five days - go to a<br/>\ndifferent town, stay in a motel with a pool, spend time with her and see if<br/>\nshe finds a way to tell you what&#39;s wrong.  Tell her you&#39;re worried about how<br/>\nsad she&#39;s been.  Tell her you want to help.   She needs you to be with her.<br/>\nSpend time with her doing things that are important to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the trend of looking for all manner of outside forces (food,<br/>\nchemicals, this, that) or syndromes or disorders to explain behavior we<br/>\ndon&#39;t understand  but I caution against any limiting or changing of her <br/>\naccess to the things she&#39;s familiar with.  She&#39;s been through a move and a <br/>\nlot of change already.  The more you mess with what she knows and loves the <br/>\nmore stress you add to her world.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287472904,"authorName":"wuweimama","from":"&quot;wuweimama&quot; &lt;wuweimama@...&gt;","profile":"wuweimama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Need insight for a child who destroys &#39;things&#39;","postDate":"1166311227","msgId":19822,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVtMXV2citubzU4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVsdjdudStlNWQ4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19819,"nextInTopic":19823,"prevInTime":19821,"nextInTime":19823,"topicId":19786,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here are some concrete suggestions from another thread that I posted on: 1.

See &quot;The Five Love Languages for Children&quot;. The<br/>\nauthor suggests that the five are: acts of service, physical touch,<br/>\ngifts, affirmation, quality time. We generally value all; but there is<br/>\nusually a primary &#39;love language&#39; and each adult or child feels more<br/>\nfull of love, or empty of love, if their love language isn&#39;t being<br/>\n&quot;spoken&quot; to them consistently, daily.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Eye contact when speaking with child.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Validation of feelings. The &quot;How to Talk so Kids will Listen, How<br/>\nto Listen so Kids will Talk&quot; discusses pratical communication skills<br/>\nfor increasing the dialogue effectiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry&quot; helps discuss allowing the &quot;ugly&quot;<br/>\nfeelings about a sibling or situation to be voiced and validated. This<br/>\nhelps the child work through them so that he can move away from<br/>\ncarrying them alone. And then he can gain perspective once these are<br/>\nnot such a heavy burden.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; discusses &#39;picking your battles&#39;. Basically,<br/>\nit has a &quot;Basket&quot; criteria of degrees of battle. Basket &quot;A&quot; is safety<br/>\nissues. These are critical to health and worth making an issue over.<br/>\nBasket &quot;C&quot; are little things that won&#39;t matter tomorrow, next week or<br/>\nnext month. These are ignored and dealt with without creating an<br/>\nissue/battle or power struggle.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasket &quot;B&quot; are the important but negotiable items which need buy-in.<br/>\nMost things are here. But the issue is to determine &#39;Is this critical<br/>\nto the family&#39;s happiness *today* to create a power struggle?&#39; What<br/>\nother ways can this issue be tackled together as a team?<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Food intolerances: dairy causes aggression in our son. We see his<br/>\nbehavior change about one hour after consumption and lasts 1-6 hours<br/>\ndepending on quantity consumed. Also, high fructose corn syrup (not<br/>\nsugar), artificial colors: red and yellow. See &quot;The Feingold Diet&quot;<br/>\non-line.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. &#39;Meet the underlying needs&#39; is my mantra. Focus on working to solve<br/>\nthe need, rather than focusing on eliminating the behavior<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI strongly and firstly recommend The Explosive Child for tools of<br/>\n&quot;choosing your battles&quot;. It can change the dynamics to just essential<br/>\nsafety issues, instead of having everything be a battle. I forgot<br/>\nabout high fructose corn syrup. Ds can NOT consume this at all without<br/>\nreaction. Occasionally he does. Then, we all have a very tough several<br/>\nhours. Eliminate this from your lives to the extent possible; it is in<br/>\neverything.

I<br/>\n&gt; could easily <br/>\n&gt; ramble here but will try to keep my thoughts a<br/>\n&gt; little organized!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I knew something wasn&#39;t &#39;right&#39; with my son. I was<br/>\n&gt; told over and <br/>\n&gt; over that it was a phase, it was me, etc etc but<br/>\n&gt; when he was 6 1/2 I <br/>\n&gt; had had enough. My second child was 2 1/2 and STILL<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t showing <br/>\n&gt; any of the same characteristics. I would classify my<br/>\n&gt; son <br/>\n&gt; as &#39;tortured&#39; in that time. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He wouldn&#39;t go to the extent that you mention with<br/>\n&gt; destroying but he <br/>\n&gt; did rip curtain rods out of the wall, break toys,<br/>\n&gt; put a doorknob <br/>\n&gt; through the wall, self punish etc etc. I will say my<br/>\n&gt; husband and I <br/>\n&gt; were at a loss. There were many tactics we took as<br/>\n&gt; far as parenting <br/>\n&gt; him  that did NOT work. I also took him to a<br/>\n&gt; chiropractor, a <br/>\n&gt; kinesthesiologist, and a cranial sacral therapist. I<br/>\n&gt; went, mostly in <br/>\n&gt; consultation, to a child psychologist. I ~wanted~<br/>\n&gt; more than anything <br/>\n&gt; to help my son.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I could describe the therapies we used but I think<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;d be better <br/>\n&gt; off googling them. He became less angry and rageful<br/>\n&gt; over time. He <br/>\n&gt; also stopped having headaches weekly ( 2-3xs),<br/>\n&gt; stopped having that <br/>\n&gt; wet spot in the front of his pants all the time, and<br/>\n&gt; stopped this <br/>\n&gt; random vomiting he&#39;d do in the morning sometimes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unschooling has helped him TREMENDOUSLY. He&#39;s more<br/>\n&gt; open and loving. <br/>\n&gt; Definately feels that I&#39;m on HIS side now where I<br/>\n&gt; just don&#39;t know if <br/>\n&gt; he felt that before. He&#39;s also older and can be<br/>\n&gt; reasoned with better <br/>\n&gt; but he has not destroyed anything in anger in years.<br/>\n&gt; YAY! He was <br/>\n&gt; also diagnosed with anxiety and depression (and ADHD<br/>\n&gt; for the record, <br/>\n&gt; oh and Oppositional Defiance Disorder ~which I would<br/>\n&gt; not accept) and <br/>\n&gt; is on medication to help him with his depression and<br/>\n&gt; anxiety.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve had him home for 1 1/2 yrs. Not going to<br/>\n&gt; school helps a lot <br/>\n&gt; too. For the record, he liked school and the<br/>\n&gt; teachers liked him. He <br/>\n&gt; never acted out in school. It was the social<br/>\n&gt; condtions and the bully <br/>\n&gt; situation that made us quit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can sympathize with you. Many times no one WANTS<br/>\n&gt; to give you a <br/>\n&gt; break b/c you, and they, never know when a rage may<br/>\n&gt; occur. We do use <br/>\n&gt; Bach&#39;s Rescue Remedy (when I remember!) and it<br/>\n&gt; always seems to <br/>\n&gt; help.. ~reminding me that it may long overdue to<br/>\n&gt; take that out <br/>\n&gt; again, helps me too! ~ FYI~ it&#39;s very intense<br/>\n&gt; tasting, IMO, and we <br/>\n&gt; just rub it on the back of our neck or wrists.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My son would go blind in a rage too. I guess<br/>\n&gt; thinking about it, <br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s only a recent thing that seems to have let<br/>\n&gt; go... I wish you <br/>\n&gt; the best. Get a break when you can to refuel. Keep a<br/>\n&gt; little journal <br/>\n&gt; maybe, I do this, and write the sweet or cute things<br/>\n&gt; down. Those <br/>\n&gt; moments can be forgotten when all you can recall are<br/>\n&gt; the rages.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Best of luck to you,<br/>\n&gt; Warm regards,<br/>\n&gt; Tonya in Auburn, MA<br/>\n&gt; Christian 11.5<br/>\n&gt; Rory 7.5<br/>\n&gt; Alannah 3.5<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I guess it may not be a big thing for others on<br/>\n&gt; the list, but it <br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; for me.  Especially when things like the curtains<br/>\n&gt; were handmade by <br/>\n&gt; me <br/>\n&gt; &gt; for our home.

The people who are saying  hurtful things to you over their heads are <br/>\nreally insensitive, but  that&#39;s just how the world can be sometimes. It sucks <br/>\nand I am sorry about  it :-( I think the easy solution would be to cut their  <br/>\nhair so that they clearly look like boys. I didn&#39;t read past posts  but maybe <br/>\nyour 5 year old insists that he not get his hair  cut? If this is the case, <br/>\nthen of course, leave it long until he gets  so sick of the comments that he <br/>\nwants it cut. Or maybe he will start  making his own comments back and he will <br/>\nstart to not care about what  people say? But from what I understood, the <br/>\ndecision not to cut was yours,  and to me, that would be like dressing your son in <br/>\na skirt. Its kind of  mean. Of course, both my boys wore my daughters clothing <br/>\nwhile they were  toddlers (sometimes IN PUBLIC) but it was what they wanted <br/>\nto do,  just a stage, no biggie. I think it would have been entirely  different <br/>\nhad I encouraged it. Though pirates and princes, rock stars  and Jesus all <br/>\nhad long hair, traditionally in our society men go short.  Also, when you are a <br/>\nmanly rock star or a pirate you have facial hair and  muscles and look really <br/>\nobviously like a man in other ways so mistakes  aren&#39;t made about gender. A <br/>\nfriend of mine had a daughter who was  undergoing chemo and didn&#39;t want to wear <br/>\nwigs until about the 10th time  she was mistaken as a boy. After that, she <br/>\ndecided wigs would make her  feel better about herself. Kids don&#39;t want to be <br/>\nsingled out as being  different. It hurts their feelings.<br/>\n <br/>\nHope that helps,<br/>\nAdriana       <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":133390932,"authorName":"Mara","from":"Mara &lt;mamadeluz@...&gt;","profile":"mamadeluz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[unschoolingbasics] But he LOOKS like a girl!","postDate":"1166291701","msgId":19808,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk0MjkyNS41Mjg1My5xbUB3ZWI1MzIwOS5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDc2MjY0LjI4ODc3LnFtQHdlYjMxNDA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":19806,"nextInTopic":19810,"prevInTime":19807,"nextInTime":19809,"topicId":19786,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Both my boys get this response a lot.

I am on (what seems like) an ever ending quest to find answers for my dauther........before she ends up being put on some serious Anti-Pychotic Drugs.  The consensus of her Ped. Neuro is that she has Bipolar, Aspergers, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Dygraphia and Sensory Processing Disorder.  And of course the Neuro wants us to seek out those diagnoses with various Phychologists and Phychiatrists.  Right now she has a huge yeast overgrowth (we are addressing that), and I have been told by my Holistic Dr. that she is allergic to wheat, gluten, corn and food dye.  Actually we figured out years ago that she is not tolerant to corn or food dye.  We are seeing some improvements with the GF diet, but it&#39;s not the whole answer.  Have you ever done/or heard of Enzyme Therapy.  That is what we are trying next.  People swear that is has been a cure for their child&#39;s autism.  So I figure why not give it a try.  I am also all for going to a<br/>\n Homeopath.  I am not at all opposed to doing the alternative thing, since we are seeing a Holistic Dr.  I have to seek all of this type of alternative/supplements/diet stuff out, and exhaust that approach before the very serious anti-pychotic drugs.   I am really scared of putting my 6 year old on such drugs.

I could easily <br/>\nramble here but will try to keep my thoughts a little organized!<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew something wasn&#39;t &#39;right&#39; with my son. I was told over and <br/>\nover that it was a phase, it was me, etc etc but when he was 6 1/2 I <br/>\nhad had enough. My second child was 2 1/2 and STILL wasn&#39;t showing <br/>\nany of the same characteristics. I would classify my son <br/>\nas &#39;tortured&#39; in that time. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe wouldn&#39;t go to the extent that you mention with destroying but he <br/>\ndid rip curtain rods out of the wall, break toys, put a doorknob <br/>\nthrough the wall, self punish etc etc. I will say my husband and I <br/>\nwere at a loss. There were many tactics we took as far as parenting <br/>\nhim  that did NOT work. I also took him to a chiropractor, a <br/>\nkinesthesiologist, and a cranial sacral therapist. I went, mostly in <br/>\nconsultation, to a child psychologist. I ~wanted~ more than anything <br/>\nto help my son.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could describe the therapies we used but I think you&#39;d be better <br/>\noff googling them. He became less angry and rageful over time. He <br/>\nalso stopped having headaches weekly ( 2-3xs), stopped having that <br/>\nwet spot in the front of his pants all the time, and stopped this <br/>\nrandom vomiting he&#39;d do in the morning sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling has helped him TREMENDOUSLY. He&#39;s more open and loving. <br/>\nDefinately feels that I&#39;m on HIS side now where I just don&#39;t know if <br/>\nhe felt that before. He&#39;s also older and can be reasoned with better <br/>\nbut he has not destroyed anything in anger in years. YAY! He was <br/>\nalso diagnosed with anxiety and depression (and ADHD for the record, <br/>\noh and Oppositional Defiance Disorder ~which I would not accept) and <br/>\nis on medication to help him with his depression and anxiety.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had him home for 1 1/2 yrs. Not going to school helps a lot <br/>\ntoo. For the record, he liked school and the teachers liked him. He <br/>\nnever acted out in school. It was the social condtions and the bully <br/>\nsituation that made us quit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can sympathize with you. Many times no one WANTS to give you a <br/>\nbreak b/c you, and they, never know when a rage may occur. We do use <br/>\nBach&#39;s Rescue Remedy (when I remember!) and it always seems to <br/>\nhelp.. ~reminding me that it may long overdue to take that out <br/>\nagain, helps me too! ~ FYI~ it&#39;s very intense tasting, IMO, and we <br/>\njust rub it on the back of our neck or wrists.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son would go blind in a rage too. I guess thinking about it, <br/>\nthat&#39;s only a recent thing that seems to have let go... I wish you <br/>\nthe best. Get a break when you can to refuel. Keep a little journal <br/>\nmaybe, I do this, and write the sweet or cute things down.

And dairy, soy, wheat, and high fructose corn syrup all are<br/>\nassociated with hyper aggressive behaviors in our son.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaomi Aldort&#39;s new book Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves and<br/>\nSheedy Kurchina&#39;s Raising Your Spirited Child both helped me learn<br/>\ncommunication tools of validation.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Childr...e=UTF8&s=books\">http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Childr...e=UTF8&s=books</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg...23288?v=glance\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg...23288?v=glance</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also see if the traits of &quot;The Highly Sensitive Child&quot; match<br/>\nyour son&#39;s temperment.

We use Natural Calm. Also Nordics Natural Cod Liver oil (peach<br/>\nflavored) have helped. When things are most explosive (tired, hungry<br/>\nand angry) we use Bach flower remedies Cherry Plum for anger; White<br/>\nChestnut for obscessive focus; and Rescue Remedy (and Elm for me for<br/>\nfeeling overwhelmed). Beech is helpful for tolerance of other&#39;s<br/>\nimperfections; and Holly for suspiciousness and jealousy. They are all<br/>\nnatural and help when everyone is melting down. Food intolerances and<br/>\nsleep needs are our biggest triggers for explosiveness.

I just wanted to tell you I understand and can sympathize with you.  We have the exact same issue (along with lots of other issues) going on in our house.  My six year old is a 45 lb. wrecking machine.  Like my hubby says we cannot just let her destroy the house.  My hubby feels like he works hard (and he does work hard) to put a nice roof over our head, and a small child is destroying the place.  We have talked to her till we are blue in the face........she just tunes us out.  No amount of consequences have worked either.  And unfortunately our only solution has been to have her essentially glued to my hip at all times, so that I have my eyeballs on her at all times.  But quite honestly I&#39;m EXHAUSTED!  Like right now she is right behind me coloring.  I never get a break, because while she is awake my eyeballs are on her.  We have also had to put locks on our bedroom door and her sisters bedroom door, because she could not respect other people&#39;s<br/>\n property.  All the scissors in our house are hidden........the dog and cats are relieved since she thought giving them regular hair cuts was ok.  And yes our walls and carpeting have taken a beating with any number of substances..........along with the stickers she stuck to her bedroom walls and then pulled them off pulling the paint and part of the dry wall with it.  And she likes taking toys and putting holes in the dry wall.   Now in our case she does not cut the curtains......she just hangs from them until the brackets are ripped right out of the wall.  So I&#39;ve just given up on curtains.  The neighbors can just look in on us.  Mariah also loves to flood floors and loves to smear an entire containers of shampoo all over the walls and floor.  She even kicked out a window one time.  Oh, I could go on and on.  Now you know why I require her to be glued to my hip.   But personally I can not go on like this either.......I need a break.<br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nCara &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:casonnier@...\">casonnier@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          I&#39;m new to US - about 6 months down the road.
