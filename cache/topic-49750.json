We are new to home Education, our children are 5 and 2","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-678026399\">Hi Holly,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, Andrew and I lived in London for about 20 years and now live in Kent in the UK.  We are new to home Education, our children are 5 and 2 years.  Our daughter started school in September, although I wasn&#39;t very happy about it.  I feel the curriculum is narrow and prescriptive and only serves to ensure the government targets are adhered to regardless of the child&#39;s needs.  Constant testing and the ensuing pressure on children to fit the mould is quite worrying.  The sense if individualism is smothered by enforced collective community.  It all sounds very nice when you listen to the management speak but when you really see what they are putting the children through it is sad and of great concern.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately our circumstances have changed which means I am going to be at home full time after the Easter holidays so we decided to look at home education.  We knew nothing about it but the more I read, the more I know unschooling is the way to go for our family.  After I stumbled across Sandra and Joyce&#39;s websites I took a huge sigh of relief. They enabled me to realise that the way I feel about my children is not weird or wrong.  Their thoughts and experiences have allowed me the space to reassess how we are living our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I didn&#39;t mean to go rambling on, just to say that there are quite a few of groups in Kent and London.  If you go to the Education Otherwise website as Schuyler suggests they have regional lists of groups throughout the country.  There are all sorts of things going on and gatherings of people doing lots of different things.  From what I have found so far home ed happens in many ways.  Some families will have a more &#39;school-like&#39; approach, others will be more autonomous.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like to chat more let me know.  As I said we are new to this but very excited about the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes<br/>\n<br/>\nKay</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":155466185,"authorName":"ksequana","from":"&quot;ksequana&quot; &lt;ksequana@...&gt;","profile":"ksequana","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: New to Unschooling in London","postDate":"1364037513","msgId":49752,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtpazMyOStmN29qQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGtpaG5jcCttc2k0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49751,"nextInTopic":49753,"prevInTime":49751,"nextInTime":49753,"topicId":49750,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Holly We used to live in UK (Liverpool) and similarly to America (and many other countries), Home Education is becoming more and more popular.
