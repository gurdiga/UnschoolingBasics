It was run by two members (a <br/>\nmother and her 18 year old son, both who are part of our homeschool <br/>\ngroup) of the Ocala Storytellers Guild. Each child (there were six <br/>\nof them) picked their own story and each week they would work on it. <br/>\nBy the end, they had to be able to tell it from memory, use facial <br/>\nand body language and vocally become the different charcaters. The <br/>\nclub ended this past week and they held their storytelling concert <br/>\nthis afternoon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShawna told her story (The Boy Who Was a Noodlehead), in front of 30-<br/>\n35 adults and children....an a stage, with a microphone...by memory. <br/>\nAfter she was finished, my husband turned to me and said &quot;She&#39;s <br/>\nshining up there.&quot; And she was. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nThis, coming from a child that *truly* did not start to live her <br/>\nlife until we took her out of school and out of therapy (speech, <br/>\noccupational, physical and mental health) a year after we adopted <br/>\nher. Shawna had always been,...facially expressionless is the best <br/>\nway I can describe it. I was questioned about it several times <br/>\nactually, by teachers and therapists. After a while though, I <br/>\nstarted noticing that when she read outloud to someone, she came <br/>\nalive and became the character! It was so unlike her. When I saw the <br/>\nsign for the storytelling club, I thought this would be something <br/>\nShawna would enjoy because of that. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe was so awesome! She got up on the stage like she owned it and <br/>\nwas full of confidence. I&#39;m going to blog about it when I get my <br/>\npictures developed but I just had to share it here. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (7), Shawna (10) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 30, 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://foreverparents.com\">http://foreverparents.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12646,"nextTopicId":12628}}
