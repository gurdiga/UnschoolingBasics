Does a warm bath, do quiet movies all cuddled up <br/>\nwith mom and dad and younger siblings in a darkened room in a darkened house? <br/>\nWarm milk? Does the activity level in a day make a difference? If you spend <br/>\nhours and hours at the park is he more likely to go to sleep in the evening? If <br/>\nyou go to a ball room, one of those indoor playrooms with balls and tunnels and <br/>\nslides and spend all day playing is he more sleepy at the end? What about going <br/>\nswimming? that&#39;s hugely enervating. Does nothing seem to impact his seemingly <br/>\ninfinite energy supply? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing that the more you are active during the day, and I don&#39;t mean just <br/>\nbouncing in a bounce house, but seriously going out to seek new and exciting <br/>\nplaces to play all day long, the more likely he&#39;ll be tired by the end of the <br/>\nday. And if you implement falling to sleep things, quieter house, quieter rooms, <br/>\ndarker rooms, cozy cuddle spaces, story reading, relaxing baths, gentle talking, <br/>\nslower moments, I&#39;m guessing a busy day and a quiet evening will really help him <br/>\nto fall asleep. Try it out, see what works. See what things help to run off all <br/>\nof this fabulous energy he has and what things help to relax him. Maybe back <br/>\nstories or gentle massages with warm lotion would help. Maybe telling quiet and <br/>\ncalm stories would help. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I am really stressed about this for a few reasons. One is I don&#39;t have much &#39;me&#39; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;time and all this staying up late is getting in the way of that, leaving me <br/>\n&gt;&gt;exhausted and not motivated to do the things I like to do such as get things <br/>\n&gt;&gt;cleaned up, spend time with DH, blog, whatever. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are a couple of things you could do to facilitate more downtime for you. <br/>\nOne is simply changing the rhythm of your days so that there are breaks. The <br/>\nlikelihood that with 3 children under 5 that you are going to have really any <br/>\npersonal time is pretty small. But you can carve out breathable moments by <br/>\nfinding dvds that at least 2 of your children will enjoy during maybe your <br/>\nlittlest&#39;s naptime. When I was super tired with Simon and Linnaea I would set us <br/>\nup in a room with a mattress by the door for me to lie on. And then I would set <br/>\nup lots of things for them to do. And I would nap while they played. It meant <br/>\nthat I knew where they were. They weren&#39;t going out of the room without getting <br/>\nme to move and that I could get a nap in. Sometimes, when they were older, David <br/>\nand I would take them to Ikea where they had a creche. David and I would shop <br/>\nwhile Simon and Linnaea played in the daycare creche. We had walkie talkies so <br/>\nthat if anything happened we could be paged and it gave us this little time to <br/>\nourselves. It wasn&#39;t an oft used tool, and they stopped wanting to go in there <br/>\nat some point, but it did give David and I the occasionally date moment. I know <br/>\nothers have spoken of going to McDonalds playlands late at night so that their <br/>\nkids could run themselves out a bit before bed. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing you can do is hire someone to come and hang out with your kids <br/>\nwhile you are home. See if you local homeschooling community has any teens <br/>\ninterested in making a little money co-watching children. You&#39;d be home with <br/>\nyour family while bringing someone else to take some of the burden off of your <br/>\nshoulders. It would also help you to be more engaged with your new community. <br/>\nYou could see about getting someone in to clean once a week. It may cost less <br/>\nthan you think and it would certainly take away your need to clean at the <br/>\nexpense of time spent with your children. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could get a crockpot so that you can put food in when you have a moment and <br/>\nhave dinner ready much later without a huge amount of attention spent on <br/>\ncooking. My dad adored our crockpot. It meant he could feed my brother and me <br/>\nwell even if he had to work later than he anticipated. Anything that frees up <br/>\nmore time is a good thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have 3 children under 5 years of age. That&#39;s a lot of time investment. If <br/>\nkeeping them home with you is a priority there is really no way around the time <br/>\nyou have to invest to keep your house singing and playing peacefully, which <br/>\nisn&#39;t the same as quietly. With every one of your requests for help I keep <br/>\ngiving you the same answer: time. You have to invest time. And I understand, at <br/>\nleast sort of, it&#39;s been a long time since I had two children under 5, it&#39;s been <br/>\na long time since I had to be everything to Simon and to Linnaea, what it is to <br/>\nbe tired all the time, what it is to have nothing left for yourself. There is a <br/>\ntrick of it. There is a meditative trick to finding the moments for yourself <br/>\nwithin the moments for others. When you get it right, when you inhale and exhale <br/>\nin the rhythm of your days, it&#39;s like nothing else, it&#39;s like walking on water. <br/>\nIt&#39;s about being present in that moment. Not thinking about cleaning, not <br/>\nthinking about blogging, not thinking about when your time will start, not <br/>\nlooking outside and away for things to do, but being right where you are and <br/>\nwith who you are with. Oh, my gosh, it is so very powerful. <br/>\n<br/>\nI got sent this wonderful video link this morning called <br/>\nMoments: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://vimeo.com/8189067.\">http://vimeo.com/8189067.</a> Life is just a series of those. And if you <br/>\ncan figure out how to engage with those series of moments and not resent those <br/>\nmoments, oh, it is the most amazing skill. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Second is because DH is looking at me like I don&#39;t have a clue how to parent and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;that I am a doormat to our children. He works so much lately and is so tired he <br/>\n&gt;&gt;hasn&#39;t helped me put them to bed since we moved in. I do everything for the 3 of <br/>\n&gt;&gt;them, everything.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe he isn&#39;t looking at you that way. Maybe you are so afraid that you are <br/>\nclueless that you are pressing upon him this vision of yourself. I assume his <br/>\nworking is helping you to stay home. David works for that freedom for me. I can <br/>\nremember really wanting him to know what hell it was to be home so that he would <br/>\nappreciate all that I did. But it wasn&#39;t hell, it was hard, but I got to be <br/>\nevery moment where I most wanted to be. And I still do. I&#39;ve gotten to see far <br/>\nmore moments of Simon&#39;s and Linnaea&#39;s lives than I&#39;ve missed because of my very <br/>\ngenerous and very supportive husband. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a gift, it&#39;s a luxury item this life, this unschooling life. I don&#39;t have <br/>\nany promise that it will last any longer than it has. I would work very hard to <br/>\nkeep it going, but I don&#39;t have to because David has worked so diligently to <br/>\nkeep me in these diamonds and pearls that have been the moments with Simon and <br/>\nLinnaea. That doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t lose it, that I don&#39;t have moments when <br/>\nI think of what might also have been, but it does keep me humble and grateful <br/>\noutside of the stumbling. And when I have the moments of what might have been I <br/>\ntry and spin them out as far as I can, I try and see where it would have gone in <br/>\nsome sort of Scrooge ghost of future yet to come tale and it always has gotten <br/>\nme to somewhere I wouldn&#39;t want to be nearly as much as where I am. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the ways to get you through bad moments are making sure that you are <br/>\neating well. Make sure that your energy levels are as buffered as they can <br/>\npossibly be. Have lots of yummy foods around that you can grab and go with. Easy <br/>\nto put together things. Lower your expectations of what you can start and finish <br/>\nin a day. If the house is driving you nuts, look for smaller solutions to <br/>\ncleaning. Put boxes or buckets around that you can throw toys into easily to <br/>\ntidy out a room. Don&#39;t see it as a failed attempt if you start doing the dishes <br/>\nonly to be pulled away by the three children who so definitely need you and want <br/>\nyou. See it as a few dishes done. Get paper plates to use when days are too <br/>\nhectic for dish washing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":328683493,"authorName":"naturalmommyx2","from":"&quot;naturalmommyx2&quot; &lt;naturalmommyx2@...&gt;","profile":"naturalmommyx2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Kids won&#39;t sleep, deny being tired, overtired.","postDate":"1289289178","msgId":45274,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGliYXVrcSthdGc2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":45275,"prevInTime":45273,"nextInTime":45275,"topicId":45274,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Christina here again, I have posted a couple times in the last few weeks.

I am in the beginning of this unschooling shift and keep finding myself lost in transition not knowing what to do. I know that ultimately this is a good thing and is providing an opportunity to take a long hard look at myself. I apologize now for the long post!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 4 yr old DS has had sleep issues since he was 3 months old. He just doesn&#39;t want to sleep. He will keep himself awake until he can no longer do so. He will have all the classic signs of being tired, then overtired. We just moved almost 2 months ago and I think this could be part of the adjustment. Before we moved he would somtimes keep himself up till about 10 or 11 but now its 12 or even 1am! Now recently because he can&#39;t sleep he keeps his 3 year old sister awake playing. She is usually our by 7 and naps in the day, great sleeper:)In turn this keeps my 11 month old up since they keep barging in the room when I am nursing him to sleep or they are being so loud. Everyone in the house is tired and stressed out at night now. My DH and I can&#39;t even watch a movie at night together without being interrupted 50 times. I feel I have tried everything. I have provided them an array of choices such as playing in their room till they feel like going to sleep, sleep in my room, watch tv till they fall asleep(or not), separate them into different rooms,etc. But my DS, Sheamus just keeps going and going and going!!! He, by the third night of this, around 7pm says &quot;I want to go to nap&quot; (I love hearing him say that cuz it is not often he will admit he is tired) So we go get settled in to beds or floors or wherever he chooses and then it seems he has to go another round of playing!! I am really stressed about this for a few reasons. One is I don&#39;t have much &#39;me&#39; time and all this staying up late is getting in the way of that, leaving me exhausted and not motivated to do the things I like to do such as get things cleaned up, spend time with DH, blog, whatever. Second is because DH is looking at me like I don&#39;t have a clue how to parent and that I am a doormat to our children. He works so much lately and is so tired he hasn&#39;t helped me put them to bed since we moved in. I do everything for the 3 of them, everything. Tonight I locked myself in my room with my 11 mo. and took a bath with him, playing, nursing, playing, nursing, hoping they would somehow be asleep or my husband would take over. I felt like i was going to lose it with anger, the bath helped but when I got out I could here my kids playing in the toilet in the other bathroom! Icing to the cake! DH either fell asleep or was choosing to do nothing. I sat in the hallway and cried. My DD said &quot;mommy is crying cause she don&#39;t like us?&quot; That obviously made me more sad. I don&#39;t want her to feel that way. My son told her &quot;mommy is because what we&#39;re doing all night, playing around and not going to nap&quot;. I put my baby to sleep and put them in their beds, removed most toys and turned ALL lights off. They usually need the hall light on or they freak out. I laid by their doorway and much to my surprise within 10 min they were asleep. My son was out within 4 min, no crying, no fussing. It was midnight so not sure if it was how I handled it or cuz he was done. Does anyone know more about kids like this, that just flat out don&#39;t want to sleep no matter how tired they are and deny their tired feelings? What are some of the ways you radical unschoolers would handle this? I don&#39;t know what else to do but being up this late and not having &#39;me&#39; time is taking a toll. Im usually in bed well before midnight. I have brought out the bounce house and they have jumped for hours and STILL they stay up till midnight raring to go! Sorry for such a long post, right now this is my only outlet and only place to be heard and given positive advice.<br/>\nThanks in advance I know this will give me some insight. I know what is going on must be something energetic I am sending out but I am not sure what.<br/>\n-Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15770,"nextTopicId":45136}}
