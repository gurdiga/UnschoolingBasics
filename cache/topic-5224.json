We have a well which is very new and <br/>\nalot of silt comes through the filters. Anything that&#39;s white turns brown <br/>\nafter repeated water contact. Our white bathtub was brown after about a week and <br/>\nany kind of spray stuff only got the discolor off after intense scrubbing and <br/>\nthe rough traction area on the bottom never got clean. So, Joe sprayed the tub <br/>\nwhile I was &quot;relaxing&quot; on the throne and when I got up and walked by the tub <br/>\nthere where bright white streaks wherever the Ka-Boom touched. I finished <br/>\nspraying the areas and called joey up. Look!! I didn&#39;t even wipe it!!<br/>\nAbsolutely amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElissa<br/>\nMystik Hill Farm<br/>\nKearneysville, WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5192,"nextTopicId":5228}}
