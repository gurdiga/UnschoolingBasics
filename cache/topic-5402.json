They too, felt like they were doing something<br/>\nthey shouldnt be doing because they had been in public school all their<br/>\nlives. We heard this from other members of our family as well. After<br/>\nawhile when some system is around for such a long time and a majority of<br/>\npeople are doing it, it does seem like the &quot;only and right thing to do.&quot;<br/>\nUnschooling saved my sons life. Too long a story to go into except to<br/>\nsay he has dyslexia and the school decided they couldnt help him so they<br/>\nbasically stopped helping him in 3rd grade. I feel, as a mom watching<br/>\nhis torment, that I did what any individual would do that cared. I got<br/>\nhim away from the source that was injuring him even when it wasnt &quot;cool&quot;<br/>\nwith others. <br/>\nI think we all go through a process of unschooling ourselves and letting<br/>\ngo of old patterns of thoughts so we can move on. Like any other change,<br/>\nit has had its difficult moments. For the most part, including my sons<br/>\nlife:) it has been wonderful. <br/>\nMichele<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5400,"nextTopicId":5401}}
