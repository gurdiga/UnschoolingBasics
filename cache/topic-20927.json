I&#39;ve been<br/>\nmarried for 17 years, with the same partner for 19 and neither of us<br/>\nare big fans of marriage. Funny eh?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen SO many people that suffer through unhappy relationships,<br/>\nheck, ours has had some pretty major ups and downs. I take exception<br/>\nto a lot of ideas about marriage and what makes a good long-term<br/>\nrelationship. &quot;Successful&quot; isn&#39;t about staying together forever to me,<br/>\nit&#39;s about being true partners and companions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is no mandate in your head, that says marriage is morally<br/>\nbetter than living together or creating whatever kind of relationship<br/>\nworks for that couple, then it becomes irrelevant.  I dislike the idea<br/>\nof marriage for many of the same reasons Susan outlined. I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nsome pretty amazing relationships both in and outside of marriage and<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen some pretty miserable ones. I think the couple defines<br/>\n&quot;success&quot; for themselves and the fact that marriage is a government<br/>\ninstitution just muddles the whole thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd back to the unschooling/marriage thing...if my child was very<br/>\nintent on marriage at a younger age, I&#39;d trust that this was important<br/>\nto their life journey for some reason. My 17 year old doesn&#39;t even<br/>\nwant his driver&#39;s license yet, I don&#39;t think marriage is on his radar<br/>\nscreen for a long time (if ever)!:) But I could be wrong. And he&#39;s my<br/>\noldest so things may be very different for other children in this house. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh and I don&#39;t hold marriage up as some ideal to attain, so I&#39;m<br/>\npretty sure our kids don&#39;t see it as some desirable thing over and<br/>\nabove other options.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210335840,"authorName":"Susan","from":"Susan &lt;SusanYvonne@...&gt;","profile":"taodesuki","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Ren-marriage","postDate":"1169510200","msgId":20932,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3Y2Q5MGUyMDcwMTIyMTU1NmkxYjQ5ZWI1ZHlkYTYwZmY1Yjc4MzEzZjliQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTctRjk4MUVBQzEyNTJGMEUyMzk5Nzk3MkNBQUUwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTctRjk4MUVBQzEyNTJGMEUyMzk5Nzk3MkNBQUUwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":20927,"nextInTopic":20941,"prevInTime":20931,"nextInTime":20933,"topicId":20927,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am not Ren but I m not a big fan of marriage either.

And I&#39;m not in<br/>\nthe middle of divorce nor have I ever been divorced. My partner and I<br/>\nwere married after we had both children and it was decision based<br/>\nmainly on protecting our family legally and becoming eligible to adopt<br/>\nour daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a marriage certificate does not a marriage make, KWIM? We were<br/>\nperfectly content to be life-long partners and had no worries that we<br/>\nneeded to be married in order to make commitments to our relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI take issue with marriage for many reasons. For example, marriage has<br/>\nbeen held up as a golden standard in relationships and commitments but<br/>\nit is not available to all willing adults. We&#39;ve designed a society<br/>\nwhere there are specified legal benefits of marriage - insurance,<br/>\ntaxes, custody of children, etc - so I see it as basic right of living<br/>\nin a civilized society but many couples are not afforded these rights.<br/>\nIt should be all or none.
