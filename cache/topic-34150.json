I am guessing your 4 year old has forgotten<br/>\nhow to use her tongue to latch on properly since this is not something<br/>\nshe would do with a cup or even a straw.  You should be able to find a<br/>\ndiagram online (maybe La Leche League) that shows how a baby&#39;s tongue<br/>\nis  used to properly position the breast and increase the power of the<br/>\nsuck.  I am sure if your daughter saw this she could start to relearn<br/>\nthe process since the muscle memory would be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have access to a breast pump (available for rent at most birth<br/>\ncenters and hospitals), you might want to try to pump some breastmilk<br/>\nfor her.  If your 2 year old frequently nurses, this might work.  I<br/>\nfound with my son that when he was 18 months old and on a trip with<br/>\nhis dad for 5 days I was barely able to maintain my milk supply via<br/>\npumping.  When he was 2.5 and I had to go on a trip without him for 9<br/>\ndays, I found I wasn&#39;t able to pump any milk at all and I ended up<br/>\nhaving to wean him then.  Not sure about other people&#39;s experiences<br/>\nwith pumping during extended breastfeeding, but that was mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you can figure out a way to make this work.
