And - we supported that interest strongly by playing  <br/>\nArthur with her, getting her all the little Arthur books, getting the  <br/>\nArthur dolls, getting her an Arthur lunchbox to carry around some of  <br/>\nher books. I found the author&#39;s website and we found games and  <br/>\ncoloring pages and Target carried Arthur activity books. There was  <br/>\neven a phone number you could call and hear a &quot;message&quot; from the  <br/>\nauthor in which he talked about the book he was currently writing. On  <br/>\nand on...we lived and breathed Arthur.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day she put some music from an Arthur episode on a cd mix  <br/>\nshe was making for her karate studio. As she was playing it, she said,  <br/>\nto her dad, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s Art Garfunkel singing - you like him, right?&quot;  <br/>\n&lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nProviding STRONG support for whatever the child&#39;s interest is - Blues  <br/>\nClues or Arthur or karate or dance or making potions out of leaves and  <br/>\ndirt or climbing walls or drawing cartoons or whatever - is the key to  <br/>\nhappy and productive unschooling! I&#39;ve told stories before about  <br/>\nsupporting my middle daughter&#39;s interest in CATS, the musical. Let&#39;s  <br/>\njust say we saw that show live about 10 times, in full costume and  <br/>\nmakeup, driving hours to get to a where it was being performed. We  <br/>\nwatched the video maybe hundreds of times. And much much more. It led  <br/>\nto so many other interests, led us down so many paths I could never  <br/>\nhave imagined. That daughter is now in France, living there for 3  <br/>\nmonths, studying history, films, and creative writing, and spending  <br/>\nevery spare minute at museums, shows, historic sites. I can look back  <br/>\nand see how supporting CATS paved the way for the her to be where she  <br/>\nis now.<br/>\n<br/>\nEve though you can&#39;t predict the future, the best preparation for a  <br/>\nrich and wonderful future life is - tadaa - living a rich and  <br/>\nwonderful present life!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":119968487,"authorName":"jenniferbreseman","from":"&quot;jenniferbreseman&quot; &lt;jen@...&gt;","profile":"jenniferbreseman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Make my anxiety go away","postDate":"1203514582","msgId":30089,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZwaGFjbStvb3BwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJEQzhDOUE3LTMyOTItNERGOS1CQTVELTlBQzZGMTk5QTI2Q0BtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30087,"nextInTopic":30098,"prevInTime":30088,"nextInTime":30090,"topicId":29988,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Very impressive!

I was just about to post a question about piano lessons and practice.  Found myself these days pushing Lukas to practice with all kinds of great wisdoms around what practice can do for him.  Now I am wondering if my pushing is just something I need....probably is...I was going to ask what others do around piano practice.  He loves the piano, doesn&#39;t want to stop lessons but clearly isn&#39;t in a space to practice like he was a number of weeks ago.  I think I got my answer...but thought I would look for some more feedback.  We are certainly moving along in our deschooling process and I feel my concerns and panic are lessening though I do have these questions that linger when what I am doing just isn&#39;t working.

My name is Tara, wife to Justin for 5.5 years and mom to 8 yr old son, Z. Z went to a private school for 2.5 years before we finally woke up and took him out. He&#39;s been out for over a year now and we have no intentions of looking back!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend (SwissArmyWife) gave me the link to this group and I must admit even after unschooling for a year now, within hours of reading thru some of these posts, I was amazed at the awesome info I picked up (esp stuf I thought I already knew)! I&#39;m looking forward to absorbing more!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here&#39;s my question that I&#39;m hoping some veterans can give me some insight on:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son dyed his hair a rockin&#39; shade of (almost neon) blue. He really loved it for about 24 hours. Most people we hang around are unschoolers who would all say &quot;Cool hair!&quot; and get on with what they were doing (and others that didn&#39;t know us didn&#39;t say anything). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut family members are a different story. We went out to eat with my parents who could not stop teasing him about his hair! (Dang those public school people! lol) Now he&#39;s always trying to hide his hair and is very insecure about it (it is semi-permenant dye so it&#39;s not going anywhere soon either). I&#39;m a bit annoyed (with my parents) that my once excited son is now shy about his awesome hair.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how to handle this with people, especially parents. Is this just a natural side effect of such cool hair that I should allow him to learn from or should I step in and say &quot;Zip it already&quot;? Or should I only step in at a certain point and what is that point? I feel like I should have handled the whole situation differently but am not really sure how.
