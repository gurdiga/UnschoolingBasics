It&#39;s not a <br/>\nfair characterization of the spanish schools as we were foreigners -- <br/>\nbut it does give a sense of what it&#39;s like to go to school as a <br/>\nforeigner anywhere ...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were put in the spanish schools without speaking spanish -  it was a <br/>\nvery difficult experience for me and my brother -- I was glad to have <br/>\nlearned spanish but I think I could have done it a different way.  In my <br/>\nfirst school, as soon as I learned spanish well enough  I told my <br/>\nteacher my mother needed us at home and we skipped school every <br/>\nafternoon for months ... the only reason we were caught by my mother is <br/>\nthat we were walking around town and she saw us.  We tried to convince <br/>\nher it was a holiday but she didn&#39;t believe us .... (chuckle)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I was in a small eclectic international school called Yes and then <br/>\ncalled Zoon.  I was in a class with three children and their mother.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s where I learned to hate art --it was the first subject I got a <br/>\npoor grade in.  We had a lot of free time and all hung out in the living <br/>\nroom of the school.  Some pretty laid back teachers as well ...<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we went to a large spanish school --  we had to take two public <br/>\nbuses, wear uniforms, and the other children were mean to us.  My <br/>\nbrother still didn&#39;t speak much spanish and every day the teachers would <br/>\nbring him to me in my class cause he was crying.  I remember in Math <br/>\nthat they divide differently than I was taught -- (they just do the long <br/>\ndivision going up rather than down).  It was a frustrating experience <br/>\ncause math was the only thing I could learn because there was still a <br/>\nlanguage barrier.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I went to a really cool international school that was quite hard. I <br/>\nremember learning algebra and loving it.  I also remember having to sing <br/>\nin front of my class and getting a poor grade -- very embarrassing for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for asking Kathy --  it was a very formative experience - quite <br/>\nliberating and something I wouldn&#39; t have done in the States.  When I <br/>\nreturned, I quickly started following all the rules and getting good <br/>\ngrades.  Interesting enough, when I returned to the states they didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow where to place me.  They tested me and placed me two grade ahead <br/>\nand three grades ahead in math.  It wasn&#39;t that I had the knowledge to <br/>\nbe placed ahead (well I did in math) - I had the thinking skills and <br/>\nprocessing skills.  So despite not learning content in Spain due to the <br/>\nlanguage, I sure learned something. <br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Thanksgiving to the U.S. folks here,<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nDeborah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRod Thomas wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Deborah<br/>\n&gt; What is schooling like in Spain?

While I still use some of their materials, I got stuck <br/>\nin the trap of losing my own creativity as I try to implement this <br/>\n&quot;expert&quot; approach that uses creativity -- how ironic.    I am on several <br/>\nhomeschooling lists but tend to get the feeling I am once again copying <br/>\nothers and losing my own sense of connection -- so I decided to balance <br/>\nthings by joining an unschooling list and listening and learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nGlad this is an beginners list and look forward to seeing what unfolds <br/>\n... I am a bit nervous as I don&#39;t think that I am the maverick (don&#39;t <br/>\nknow if that is the right word) that it takes to be a true unschooler.  <br/>\nMy image is that unschoolers are willing to buck all conventions -- how <br/>\nironic because I am quite unconventional in many areas of my life but I <br/>\nalso so crave some social conformity and acceptance. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I look forward to dispelling some old fears and preconceptions and <br/>\ncontinue the path of finding my family&#39;s own center and path,<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nDeborah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7690,"nextTopicId":7932}}
