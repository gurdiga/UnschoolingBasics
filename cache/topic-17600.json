But maybe she&#39;s just  watching tv for lack of better <br/>\nthings to do! But TV isn&#39;t bad, so nothing  is &quot;better&quot;. Ok, then I <br/>\nshould suggest something.

I  see so many things out <br/>\nthere to do that my boys don&#39;t see, because I read the  newspaper and they <br/>\ndon&#39;t, because I am online with other local groups and hear  what is available and <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t, etc.  I would be doing them a great  disservice to know of all <br/>\nthese cool things and not tell them about it so they  have the opportunity to <br/>\nsay yes or no.  Maybe don&#39;t think about it quite so  much and just ask, just <br/>\nlive.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIf your hubby saw something cool going on this weekend he thought the  family <br/>\nmight like, he would probably ask if anyone wanted to go.  <br/>\n <br/>\n:-)<br/>\nRelax,<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17580,"nextTopicId":17620}}
