Dd (6-3/4 ya know how important that 3/4 is to someone her<br/>\nage) and ds (13) and I have been homeschooling from the beginning, relaxed<br/>\nhomeschooling for about 12 of those years and really unschooling for the<br/>\npast 6 months or so.  Dd is an artist, loves pokemon, yu-gi-oh, yoga,<br/>\nsoccer, polly pockets, barbies, Harry Potter and most of all medieval<br/>\nimaginary play.  Ds is a musician, loves fantasy role-playing video games,<br/>\nDDR, a voracious reader and has a tender, gentle heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my question: I would very much like to turn ds loose researching his<br/>\ninterests on the internet but I don&#39;t know how to protect him from the<br/>\nimages and ideas that would scar his tender heart and brain should he<br/>\nstumble across them.  Is there any safe way for him to surf to his heart&#39;s<br/>\ncontent without fear of coming across explicit material?  If it matters, we<br/>\nare all Apple computers in this house. What do you do?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3283,"nextTopicId":3303}}
