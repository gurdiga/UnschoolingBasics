If so, how about team work--are there ever other people involved?  Nutrition, herbology, anatomy (I know you already thought of that), science--do certain materials aide the muscle building better than others?  What offers the most resistance?  Why?  What materials can be used to make weights, machines etc?  Can you visit a place that manufactures these things?  Sales?  You get the theme here.  Time management is another.  Statistics.....how many repetitions in how long of a time period?  Charting--measurements, weight loss/gain, etc.  Does the brain behave differently because of the exercise.  What physical/emotional differences are evident after 1 week of not working out.  Does the concentration level change depending upon yoga being added?  I am reaching here to get you to find your own questions.  there are probably lots more!  Where in the world do the world champions live?  Where did they train and how?  Where will the Olympics be?  What are teh Olympics--when was weight lifting determined to be a sport?  Where are its origins?  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck!<br/>\nKelley in FL<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288405080,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"&quot;diana jenner&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Help w/ educationalize","postDate":"1204603627","msgId":30458,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDgwMzAzMjAwN20xZjQ0ZjJmNG85NDlmNTYzZjlkYjRjZmEwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMWEwMWM4N2Q3NSRmMDg1NjllMCQwYTAwYThjMEBNYWluQ29tcHV0ZXI+","referencesHeader":"PDAzMDMyMDA4MTkxMS41OTE1LjQ3Q0M0RDQ3MDAwRTZEMDQwMDAwMTcxQjIyMTkzMTAwMDI5QjBBMDJEMjA4OUI5QTAxOUMwNDA0MEEwREJGMEEwQzBFMDAwQTA0MEQ5RDBFMDNAYXR0Lm5ldD4JIDwwMDFhMDFjODdkNzUkZjA4NTY5ZTAkMGEwMGE4YzBATWFpbkNvbXB1dGVyPg=="},"prevInTopic":30448,"nextInTopic":30499,"prevInTime":30457,"nextInTime":30459,"topicId":30442,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
