I&#39;d look to see if <br/>\nthere were any kind of pattern to *when* your dd is blowing up - <br/>\ncould she be hungry or tired or overwhelmed or lonely or bored? could <br/>\nfrustrations be &quot;stacking up&quot; over a day or week?

This could be part of her deschooling <br/>\nprocess - she isn&#39;t sure where the boundaries are and is trying to <br/>\nfigure that out. Personally, I don&#39;t think so much in terms <br/>\nof &quot;setting&quot; boundaries - I *have* personal boundaries and so do my <br/>\nfamily members, and its important to express those and honor them. At <br/>\nthe same time, my own boundaries can sometimes be more fluid - <br/>\nbecause I&#39;m an adult and can have a certain amount of compassion for <br/>\nmy kids&#39; needs. My kids boundaries aren&#39;t necessarily as fluid as <br/>\nmine, so its important that I help them express *and* defend those <br/>\nboundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for example, I might not react to my 7yo when she says something <br/>\nto me like &quot;you&#39;re an idiot&quot; (or I might say &quot;I&#39;m sorry you feel that <br/>\nway, want a sandwich?&quot;), but if she said that to Ray or a same age <br/>\nfriend, I&#39;d more likely jump in with &quot;hey! that&#39;s not necessary. do <br/>\nyou need something?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231930081,"authorName":"DJ250","from":"&quot;DJ250&quot; &lt;dj250@...&gt;","profile":"wibberbie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: 8 y.o. gets angry and calls us names","postDate":"1234967829","msgId":38372,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk4OEE3NjhCOUI2RTRGRTJBODFBREQ4QUE3MUY1M0Y4QFJvY2tldFNhdWNlMj4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGduaDYzZisyaGFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGduaDYzZisyaGFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38371,"nextInTopic":38373,"prevInTime":38371,"nextInTime":38373,"topicId":38370,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks, Verna.
