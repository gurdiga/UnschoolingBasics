I <br/>\n*loved* my guinea.  He was the coolest pet.  His &quot;home&quot; was an <br/>\naquarium that was on its side with cedar shavings.  He was litter <br/>\nbox trained as well.  He was free roaming throughout the house, <br/>\nwhich had its good moments and bad.  Guineas are chewers and they <br/>\nlove paper.  He chewed a huge hole in one of my cross stitch <br/>\npatterns once (fortunately it only effected the border of the design <br/>\nwhich was repeating so I was able to figure it out).  He also liked <br/>\nto unroll toilet paper and tear it up.  I just learned to keep the <br/>\nbathroom door closed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGuineas make this wonderful chirping sound and love to talk to you.  <br/>\nThey also love to cuddle on your lap and snooze.  Very affectionate <br/>\nand they have great personalities.  I would suggest trying to get a <br/>\nvery young (but fully weaned) guinea so you can hand and litterbox <br/>\ntrain it.  Older ones will use the same box out of habit, but will <br/>\nalso go wherever they please if they aren&#39;t truly litterbox <br/>\ntrained.  I would also suggest getting one from someone who breeds <br/>\nthem than from a pet store.  There is no guarantee as to how old <br/>\nguineas are at pet stores.  They will tell you they are &quot;young&quot; but <br/>\nguineas grow to mature size rather rapidly so it is hard to tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also know people who allow their guineas to live in the gardens.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":211170288,"authorName":"JESARMEY@aol.com","from":"JESARMEY@...","profile":"mommajj02","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Anyone have a Guinea Pig??","postDate":"1112291756","msgId":5344,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlMS4zOTRjZDY0NS4yZjdkOTNhY0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5338,"nextInTopic":5347,"prevInTime":5343,"nextInTime":5345,"topicId":5334,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Penny, We had a guinea pig and he was great .

A lot of people make some <br/>\nstandard mistakes, like using cedar shavings in their cages (which can cause <br/>\nrespiratory illness in &#39;pigs) or using cages that are way too small.  We <br/>\nmade a cage using the instructions on that website, out of those <br/>\nsnap-together wire shelving things. It was very easy and it&#39;s plenty big <br/>\nenough for them to roam around in.

(old age) They are<br/>\nnice pets, easy to hold and care for, inexpensive to keep, cute to watch.<br/>\nBut my kids got tired of them and they have a pretty long life span. (5 or<br/>\nmore years)  Cats and dogs jump in your lap for attention but you have to go<br/>\nto the guinea pigs.  We keep ours in a huge (50 gal, I think) rubber maid<br/>\ntub.  We use shredded paper for bedding and I clean it out every day. They<br/>\nget carrots or some other fruit or veggie every day.(they need it)  When we<br/>\nhad two, they often wheeked for their goodies, but the one alone is fairly<br/>\nquiet.  The kids do go through spells where they&#39;ll play with it a lot, but<br/>\nthen weeks might go by where the only contact she gets is from me.  :-(  I<br/>\nguess it depends on your kids and their interest level.
