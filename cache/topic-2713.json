She <br/>\nhas known about the stones since our second child, but she has put <br/>\noff the surgery until the last moment (she was more worried about the <br/>\nanesthesia than the pain until the day before yesterday).  The reason <br/>\nI bring this up here is because her doctor (not the surgeon, our <br/>\nfamily practitioner) mentioned in passing that surgeons who play <br/>\nvideo games are better at laproscopic surgeries than non video <br/>\nplayers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess anything CAN be learning!<br/>\n<br/>\nDaniel<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  The surgery went fine and she is doing very well!
