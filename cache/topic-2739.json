If you&#39;re just full of content that someone else dictated you may not be able to apply it to another situation.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI had to thank you for this post.  I was a schooled kid all the way through college.  I never did memorize my multiplication tables but did them in my head.  I loved Math despite the fact that teachers kept trying to wreck it for me.  In Grade 7 I needed glasses but didn&#39;t know.  The Algebra teacher told me after class one day &quot;don&#39;t fret-some people are no good at Math and never will be-you can do lots of other things.&quot;  There it was the LABEL.  When it came time to sign up for classes in High School I took the lowest level they would allow me and since I was on an AP course I couldn&#39;t go that low, I had to stay a year at least ahead.  I got straight A&#39;s and yet told EVERYONE I was &quot;bad at Math&quot;.  It was clinched by a Physics teacher who scolded me for working out a problem using Calculus when it wasn&#39;t fair since nobody else had taken Calculus so I would have to do it the way everyone else did.  It all fit in with the &quot;you&#39;re bad at Math&quot; stuff.  I couldn&#39;t memorize the formulas he<br/>\n wanted me to memorized when I&#39;d figured out a better way to get the answers.  Grade 9 Geometry teacher would publicly ridicule me for taking too many steps to reprove things that we cold take for granted but I loved that I could and that it worked every time and that there wasn&#39;t one RIGHT way to get an answer.  I scored ridiculously high on the Math SAT (because I didn&#39;t have to show my work I think) and yet still felt inside that I was &quot;bad at Math&quot;.  Lol I went to University accepted as a Mathematics major and still compared myself to others.  There were 20 freshman accepted to the program and 5 didn&#39;t survive the first semester and I still felt &quot;bad&quot; but I LOVED it so I stuck around.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway all that to say that even as a Mathematics major in University, I never did (and still haven&#39;t) memorized multiplication tables.  I still visualize sets of stuff and sort of count them in my head.  I can do it almost instantaneously so nobody notices.  (7X6 is 2 sets of 3 7s or double 21 so it&#39;s 42 LOL)  I just think through stuff differently than the textbooks say I should.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward and keeping on topic (sort of) I have a 7 year old.  It is FASCINATING to watch him because he does Math like I do.  I never &quot;taught&quot; him and he was never &quot;taught&quot; by the textbook methods that I was subjected to.  But he was figuring something out and I asked him to explain to me and he thinks through things like I do. (&quot;Mom itï¿½s easy because 6+6 is 12 and 12+12 is 24 so 4 rows of 6 seats has to be 24 seats.&quot;)  I don&#39;t know that he knows he is doing multiplication.   The coolest thing is there is NOBODY to tell him he is &quot;no good at Math&quot; and he doesn&#39;t have to feel like a freak because he works through stuff as opposed to memorizing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI always count that fact among the cool things that unschooling does for us.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI also found that by typing this, I&#39;ve worked through some of my &quot;back to school&quot; apprehension that I always feel at this time of year.  All the doubts of &quot;is this really the right way to go?&quot; come creeping in at the end of summer.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all for being here and for your sharing.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

I&#39;ve been reading all I can <br/>\n about Unschooling, and as I read book after book (including yours!) about <br/>\nkids  who do things like re-wiring their kitchen at age 7, I get more <br/>\ndiscouraged  than inspired.  My kids haven&#39;t necessarily found any particularly  <br/>\nbrag-worthy passion yet (other than Yugio and Pokemon memorization skills), so  it&#39;s <br/>\nsometimes hard to hear about wunderkinds.  Not that I&#39;m glad your  daughter <br/>\nhas any problems, it just reminds me that comparing my kids to anyone  is of no <br/>\nvalue!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************<br/>\nLet me tell you a story.<br/>\nJulian, now almost 14, was in school through the third grade. I had to  <br/>\nconvince TWO other parents.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe entered the third grade pretty confident. He believed he was smart,  <br/>\nparticularly at math. In the third grade, all math became about memorizing the  <br/>\ntimes tables. He just couldn&#39;t do it. He&#39;d study, then go into school and have  <br/>\nto pass timed tests. He&#39;d cry; he was so sad.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut this is a kid who&#39;d already been in many plays, with leads, and sang  <br/>\npublicly, never having trouble learning lyrics.<br/>\n <br/>\nThese fact meant nothing to him, and he just couldn&#39;t do it. And he was  <br/>\nshamed and unhappy. He left third grade NOT thinking he was very smart, and  <br/>\nespecially at math.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe kicker: I also had a hard time with times tables when I was in school,  <br/>\nand it ruined me for math forever.<br/>\n <br/>\nI told him when he left school that he NEVER had to memorize them if he  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to. And he hasn&#39;t. He can figure out, pretty quickly, what the  answer <br/>\nis to a multiplication question is, but he does not have them  memorized.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, brag about how your kids have the Pokemon and Yugio stuff memorized if  <br/>\nyou want! They&#39;re good at memorizing information that has meaning to them and <br/>\nis  useful to them. That&#39;s great! Important skill to have.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s more important to know how to learn stuff you want and need than to  <br/>\nhave any particular content learned.

School teaches that our strengths are fine, *IF* we are busy  fixing our <br/>\nweaknesses. I look at it just the opposite----shine where you  can!<br/>\n <br/>\nFor you newbies: We &quot;old farts&quot; talk about our children&#39;s strengths  because <br/>\nthat&#39;s who they ARE. That&#39;s what makes them SHINE. Yes, it may make our  <br/>\nchildren look perfect; and to me, mine ARE! Perfect JUST the way they are even  <br/>\nWITH their &quot;weaknesses&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nWE may even look &quot;perfect&quot; ----as unschooling parents. But we have  crappy <br/>\nmoments; we just CHOOSE to overlook these things because we  ARE striving to be <br/>\nbetter. Focusing on our parenting mistakes and  lowpoints can be overcome by <br/>\nlooking at all the GOOD things we do and by  striving to do better.<br/>\n <br/>\nCameron&#39;s pot-smoking comes to mind: I guess I could look at that as a  <br/>\nnegative, as a weakness. But I know he&#39;s thinking about it and making *wiser*  <br/>\nchoices than some of his friends. It&#39;s not my choice for him.<br/>\n <br/>\nI certainly TRUST him more than his friends&#39; parents trust them. And I  don&#39;t <br/>\nsee it as something that &quot;defines&#39; him in any way----certainly not  <br/>\nnegatively. But I&#39;ll spend more time talking about his music and his  film-making  and <br/>\nhis incredible kindness than I do about his lack  of----what? I can&#39;t even <br/>\n*think* of anything! &lt;G&gt; He doesn&#39;t lack anything  that he needs *right now*.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, you newbies who are looking at us as wonder-parents or our kids as  <br/>\nunschooling-Wunderkinder....it&#39;s all in the mind-set! &lt;G&gt; We write about  the good <br/>\nstuff because that&#39;s what makes them who they are. I can&#39;t even make  myself <br/>\nlook at them as lacking in something.

And, she dominates things - expects the rest of <br/>\nus to &quot;move&quot; as quickly as she does. She feels things so strongly, so <br/>\nintensely and passionately, that her wants are truly felt as &quot;needs&quot; <br/>\nand that makes her impulsive and sometimes she&#39;s unrealistic and <br/>\nignores long-term consequences for short-term payoffs.

He was used to <br/>\nlearning vocabulary and basics as he needed them (this is called <br/>\n&#39;just-in-time&#39; learning by professional educators). So he petitioned, <br/>\nover and over, to skip the intro classes and go right into the more <br/>\ninteresting ones. He managed to do that in a lot of subjects. He also <br/>\npetitioned to have different classes counted toward his degree than the <br/>\nones listed in the catalog. Got a lot of that, too.

He is totally unschooling this.  <br/>\nHe received money recently to be used for &quot;educational or medical <br/>\nexpenses&quot; so he&#39;s been trying to figure out what constitutes <br/>\neducational.

Later he stated that he could even go food <br/>\nshopping and count that as educational.  I told him he was right <br/>\n(everything counts, right).

Eventually, though, most chef&#39;s talent is going <br/>\nto even out to a point where a degree in culinary arts is what is <br/>\ngoing to be the deciding factor in getting hired.  So, we know that <br/>\neventually he will need to get a degree (go to college).  He knows <br/>\nthat he can go to college on his own schedule, though.  He can go at <br/>\n16 or 26, whenever he decides he is ready.  He is also free to go <br/>\nfull time, or take a class here and there.  He doesn&#39;t have to be on <br/>\ntheir timetable at all.  When he does go, it will be because that is <br/>\nwhere he wants to be, it will be because he knows college is the <br/>\nnext step in moving forward in life.

Eventually moving to taking classes required for what they want <br/>\nto do in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know kids who negotiated their entire college curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we could debate forever whether or not college is worthwhile - <br/>\nbut, truth is, there are degrees people might want and careers they <br/>\nmight want that require degrees. I know - somebody is almost guaranteed <br/>\nto write about how they know somebody got the career of their dreams <br/>\nwithout college - right, we know that it is possible - but the point is <br/>\nthat there are careers that will need degrees and there are kids who <br/>\nwill revel in college and get a HUGE amount out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have different experiences in college - and unschoolers who go <br/>\nto college have different experiences - VERY different ones - than <br/>\nthose of us who went from high school to college. And every kid is <br/>\ndifferent and every college is different.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am NOT saying that college ought to be the goal for everybody.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, college can be viewed as a smorgasbord of resources - the list of <br/>\nthings my kids have done and had access to is incredible - and the <br/>\nhuman resources (teachers, lab techs, other students) have been <br/>\nwonderful -- it has really contributed to my kids lives in a super <br/>\npositive way.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoya has taken photography - used the lab AND a great camera from the <br/>\ncollege. She learned to make mural prints and had some of them, along <br/>\nwith some of her poetry, displayed at an art gallery in Laguna Beach, <br/>\nCalifornia. She got a behind-the-scenes tour of a photo museum. She <br/>\ntook ceramics and got a job (recommended by her teacher) at a clay and <br/>\nglazes company and also got a job as a lab tech in the ceramics lab. <br/>\nShe was on the forensics team - got a chance to debate all over the <br/>\nstate. She sang with a performance group called Vocal Eclipse and <br/>\nlearned to sing jazz style. She took printmaking. She took several <br/>\nwriting courses - beyond the basic college writing class. History of <br/>\nFilm was incredible - she learned so much about film and shared it with <br/>\nus - we had a blast. She also took piano classes and vocal classes. She <br/>\ntook costume design and stage lighting design and those were classes in <br/>\nwhich they worked on shows that the theater department and dance <br/>\ndepartments were doing. She took a marine biology class which went on 5 <br/>\nfield trips - tide pools and out on a boat and behind-the-scenes at an <br/>\naquarium, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on and on... there were more mundane read-the-book and <br/>\ntake-the-test classes mixed in there, too. But she really made the most <br/>\nof all her classes - the maximum extent possible. She had a math class <br/>\nthat was pretty much just a regular math class - but she asked the <br/>\nteacher if she could get extra credit by reading one of Steven <br/>\nHawking&#39;s books and writing about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - our experience with college has been wonderful. I just hate to see <br/>\na &quot;culture&quot; develop in which unschooled kids are actively discouraged <br/>\nfrom trying out college - that would be going too far. I like to see <br/>\nthem encouraged to do it on their terms and not to do it if it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nsuit them.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78615010,"authorName":"mamaaj2000","from":"&quot;mamaaj2000&quot; &lt;mamaaj2000@...&gt;","profile":"mamaaj2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling & College","postDate":"1092412030","msgId":2752,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNmaW5wdStvOGszQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNmaWV0aCthNnE3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2747,"nextInTopic":2770,"prevInTime":2751,"nextInTime":2753,"topicId":2739,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Thanks,-Jennefer<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Jennefer,<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my take on college.  My 14-yo daughter draws all day.  Oh, <br/>\nyeah, she listens to music too.  She loves to draw and sing and sees <br/>\nnothing further in her life right now, meaning, she isn&#39;t thinking <br/>\nabout going to college or not going.  She is just being in the right <br/>\nnow.  I see no reason to drill college into her head.  She may or <br/>\nmay not go, and why does she need to take a lot of classes she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like and end up with a degree in Liberal Arts or some other <br/>\nuseless thing just to say she went to college.  To her, college IS <br/>\njust another school with teachers, even if it is freer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Pam was saying that she would hate for people to avoid <br/>\ncollege only because it&#39;s not unschooling.  College can be necessary <br/>\nin some fields.  Nursing is one.  Teaching is another.  Therapists <br/>\nhave to go to college.  But, you don&#39;t have to go to college to own <br/>\nyour own business.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some fields where talent will get you the job, but <br/>\neventually a degree will move you ahead of the others, like being a <br/>\nchef, or maybe something with art and drawing.  You don&#39;t have to <br/>\nhave a degree to start your own restaurant, just some core knowledge <br/>\nof cooking and sanitation and good business sense.  My friend took <br/>\nhalf of a cooking course that would have led to a certificate in <br/>\nCulinary Arts.  She took the main courses, then opened her own <br/>\nrestaurant.  She&#39;s been making money at it for two years now.  She <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t need a degree because she doesn&#39;t plan on ever working for <br/>\nsomeone else.  If her restaurant failed, she would open another <br/>\nbusiness, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 15-yo son wants to be a chef.  He spends his days cooking--and <br/>\nthen trying to get us to taste his creations &lt;g&gt;.  He is gaining so <br/>\nmuch knowledge in the area, stuff that I wouldn&#39;t in a million years <br/>\nknow.  He knew the answer to a question on Who Wants to be a <br/>\nMillionaire about the origin of the cooking wine, Sherry, yesterday <br/>\n(it was Spain).  I guessed France.  He is totally unschooling this.  <br/>\nHe received money recently to be used for &quot;educational or medical <br/>\nexpenses&quot; so he&#39;s been trying to figure out what constitutes <br/>\neducational.  Yesterday he asked me if he could pay for our trip to <br/>\nthe conference and call that educational.  I said yes, (but that he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to).  Later he stated that he could even go food <br/>\nshopping and count that as educational.  I told him he was right <br/>\n(everything counts, right).  He said, &quot;this unschooling stuff is <br/>\ncool&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, he&#39;s at a point where he wants to cook with others.  He <br/>\nwants to see how pros do it.  I&#39;ve talked to a few chefs but he <br/>\ncan&#39;t go into their kitchens because of his age, so I&#39;ve been <br/>\nlooking into both informal and formal cooking classes.  The chefs I <br/>\nknow have told me that when Sean is old enough to work in a kitchen, <br/>\nthe applicant with the most talent will get the job.  So, he is <br/>\nworking on talent.  Eventually, though, most chef&#39;s talent is going <br/>\nto even out to a point where a degree in culinary arts is what is <br/>\ngoing to be the deciding factor in getting hired.  So, we know that <br/>\neventually he will need to get a degree (go to college).  He knows <br/>\nthat he can go to college on his own schedule, though.  He can go at <br/>\n16 or 26, whenever he decides he is ready.  He is also free to go <br/>\nfull time, or take a class here and there.  He doesn&#39;t have to be on <br/>\ntheir timetable at all.  When he does go, it will be because that is <br/>\nwhere he wants to be, it will be because he knows college is the <br/>\nnext step in moving forward in life.  He won&#39;t be going because he <br/>\nwas expected to go. <br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":31945013,"authorName":"Joan Labbe & Salvatore Genovese","from":"&quot;Joan Labbe & Salvatore Genovese&quot; &lt;salgenovese@...&gt;","profile":"jrl01760","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling & College","postDate":"1092401678","msgId":2744,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEhJRVBLT09FRUlBSUJISFBKRUJQT0VJRUNQQUEuc2FsZ2Vub3Zlc2VAd29ybGRuZXQuYXR0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwODEzMDYxMDE1LjY4MTcucW1haWxAd2ViMTEzMjUubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2743,"nextInTopic":2745,"prevInTime":2743,"nextInTime":2745,"topicId":2739,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ll let Pam answer for herself, but the thing that I want is for my kids to make their own choice about college based on if they re interested, if some goal","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-484912126\">I&#39;ll let Pam answer for herself, but the thing that I want is for my kids to<br/>\nmake their own choice about college based on if they&#39;re interested, if some<br/>\ngoal they have would make college meaningful and useful, and perhaps based<br/>\non checking out and visiting college.
