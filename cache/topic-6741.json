I will admit that I am <br/>\nunsure of unscholling.  One of the reasons I wanted to homeschool was <br/>\nbecause I wanted ds to have the education I felt that I did&#39;nt have. I <br/>\nhave begun to realize that is an issue for me to deal with and not one <br/>\nto lay on my child.<br/>\n   My ds is interested and curious about so many things. And I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant anything to quash his enthusiasm-biggest reason we decided to <br/>\nhomeschool!  I guess my first question is where to start my learning <br/>\nprocess about unscholling.  At first I toyed with classical <br/>\nhomeschooling but that is just soooo ridgid and my ds began to chafe <br/>\nunder the structure of having to learn a particular thing at a <br/>\nparticular time.  I&#39;m a reader so If anyone could suggest where to <br/>\nstart and what to read I would be grateful<br/>\n   My very breif foray into this group has been very very helpful.  I <br/>\nknow there will a zillion qustions that I will have and I look forward <br/>\nto meeting all of you along the journey.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6715,"nextTopicId":6742}}
