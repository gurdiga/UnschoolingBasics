My mom never apologized though. Not to me.  She did apologize once to my DD. She was very good at looking wonderful to all the outside world while being nasty to her &quot;ungrateful children&quot;.  *sigh*  Sincere apologies are when you work hard or just stop cold turkey what you are doing or how you are behaving.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have even told the kids if they have done something they think will make me angry to come to me and say &quot;Mom, I need to talk, do you promise you won&#39;t be angry?&quot;  And I do this funny deep breath in and out thing and they tell me and we are fine.  It sounds silly, but it really helps me see how stupid I could be if I reacted the way my &quot;Mom=voice&quot; would have me react.  It sets up my brain to deal with anything that happens. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am really good at other questions, things that would have been taboo in my former family life (parents and siblings).  We have had amazing discussions about the human body, hormones, etc.  My mom would have had a fit if I had asked her anything.  Probably would have been grounded or kicked out of the house again.  Kids are curious and shouldn&#39;t have to worry that their mom will take them to a doctor if they ask sex related questions.  They should feel comfortable talking about anything with me.  I may laugh or be a little on the blushy side, but I actually enjoy listening to them.  It is funny when they have heard something or think they know what something is only to find out what it really is. lol  In my old life that would have been punishable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may never be able to undo the damage done to me by public school or my family, but I can move forward and give love and respect to my children.  I can communicate with them in a manner that doesn&#39;t destroy their curiosity and creativity or squash their self-worth.  I can work to reverse the damage done by other family that thinks control and authority is the way to parent by showing that I don&#39;t have to be that way.

I am trying to undo damaging things as well, but from other family like my mother. :(  I came from the &quot;conventional&quot; you must be perfect and worthy to gain my love, respect, trust....and all the mixed messages that came with it.  I try really really hard to not dump that on my kids.  We have talked about it a few times because they have noticed the difference between their aunts and myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do a LOT of apologizing and discussing.  We have explained many times we are not perfect, we do not know it all, we are learning right along with them.  This has helped so much.  Especially when they realize we are doing something very different than where we came from and how we were raised.  I have had to apologize in the past and say &quot;UGH!  My mom used to say that I can&#39;t believe I just said it, please forgive me&quot;....we communicate and tell the stories of the past so we can be different in our future.  I am still having issues of my mom and sister&#39;s voices in my head.  I have gotten much better now that I haven&#39;t been around them in a over a year.  The kids are happier as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully you aren&#39;t dealing with similar levels of abuse in your past, but it helps to compartmentalize.  Just because I would have been treated a certain way for wanting a cookie or wanting a certain toy....or wanting to play in makeup....or befriending people my parents thought would be a bad influence (which never happened....funny how that works)....or wanting to go to a party or concert.  I am sure you could think of other things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt goes back to the golden rule...Treat others as you would want to be treated in the same situation.  Practice what you will say...practice positive words.  I sometimes practice in a mirror so I can see if I look happy and positive when speaking things.  Sounds silly I am sure, but you would be surprised how many times your faces isn&#39;t looking like what you are saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there, it is a learning growing experience for us all!
