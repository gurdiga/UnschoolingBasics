He wants it battery operated.  He also wants it remote controlled with sensors and an automatic shut-off.  I think he&#39;ll be happy if he can just get it to lift off and fly a bit.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?  We&#39;ve looked online and so far are seeing stuff way too hard or too simple (gravity &quot;helicopters&quot; that spin when you drop them do not fit the bill, evidently.)  Something string-powered or rubber-band powered might do.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40552,"nextTopicId":40466}}
