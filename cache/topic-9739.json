Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love her. However, on another <br/>\nboard about 2 days ago, there was a post about her essay contest for <br/>\nher newest book club selection, and the fact that homeschooler are <br/>\nNOT eligible to participate in the contest. Here are some exerpts:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oprah&#39;s essay contest excludes homeschoolers<br/>\nHost taken to task for requiring &#39;state accredited&#39; education<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Contest open to all legal residents of the U.S. who are currently <br/>\nenrolled full-time (and in good standing) in a public or state-<br/>\naccredited private or parochial school, grades 9-12,&quot; states the fine <br/>\nprint on a page explaining the contest on Winfrey&#39;s website. <br/>\n<br/>\nDespite the restriction, a letter from Winfrey announcing the <br/>\ncontest, which will judge essays on the book &quot;Night,&quot; says it is <br/>\nopen &quot;to high school students across America.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Smith, president of the Homeschool Legal Defense Association, <br/>\nor HSLDA, wrote an open letter to Winfrey protesting the policy. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We contacted your show to see if homeschoolers could be included and <br/>\nwere rebuffed,&quot; wrote Smith. &quot;While we do not believe that your show <br/>\nwillfully excluded homeschoolers, the fact that homeschoolers were <br/>\nexcluded in the first place is troubling.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIan Slatter, a spokesman for HSLDA, told WND he spoke to an Oprah <br/>\nrepresentative about the policy. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We asked whether or not they could make an amendment to the rules to <br/>\nallow homeschoolers to participate, and they were not willing to do <br/>\nthat,&quot; Slatter said. <br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to Slatter, the Oprah organization would not commit to <br/>\nallowing homeschooled students to participate in future contests.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Carri Ann~<br/>\nmom to Star Wars/lego obsessed 10 y/o</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9734,"nextTopicId":9707}}
