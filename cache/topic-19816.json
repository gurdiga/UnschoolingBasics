He may not have the skills <br/>\nyet, or feel secure enough in the relationship yet, to go find an <br/>\nadult and say &quot;hey, I&#39;m bored, play/talk/hang out with me!&quot; so he&#39;s <br/>\nfalling back on the tried-and-true method of getting attention - <br/>\nfighting with his brother. <br/>\n  Yes,your right,they are usually each in their own spaces and it is usually when I am doing something like making dinner or on the computer.<br/>\n  Even if we are going for a drive somewhere if I will ask Elijah to sit up front and &quot;help&quot; me with directions or whatever their is never a problem.But if I have them both in the back<br/>\n  then I am not totally focused on Elijah he will start wrestling/play fighting and the sqeels will come and I will have to pull over until they have both stopped.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook for ways to spend more time directly in his company - not in <br/>\nthe next room or running around the house cleaning, but being right <br/>\nwhere he is. Maybe that means folding laundry or chopping vegetables <br/>\nsitting next to him while he watches tv or plays a game, or letting <br/>\nthe dishes go so you can play in the yard with hime. Offer to do <br/>\nthings you know he likes rather than waiting for him to ask.<br/>\n  I think this is the key!

If so, well, I have a lot of problems with an <br/>\nadult thinking she has a right to hit a child in the face. I don&#39;t <br/>\ncare what he calls her!

A big part of handling conflict <br/>\nis dealing with kids&#39; needs *before* the conflict gets rolling. If <br/>\nyou are waiting until the conflict has started the older boy may be <br/>\ntoo upset to express himself other than physically. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe examples you give sound like situations where an adult isn&#39;t <br/>\nright there with the boys - is that the case? If so, I&#39;d say that <br/>\nthe older boy is needing some attention. He may not have the skills <br/>\nyet, or feel secure enough in the relationship yet, to go find an <br/>\nadult and say &quot;hey, I&#39;m bored, play/talk/hang out with me!&quot; so he&#39;s <br/>\nfalling back on the tried-and-true method of getting attention - <br/>\nfighting with his brother. <br/>\n<br/>\nLook for ways to spend more time directly in his company - not in <br/>\nthe next room or running around the house cleaning, but being right <br/>\nwhere he is. Maybe that means folding laundry or chopping vegetables <br/>\nsitting next to him while he watches tv or plays a game, or letting <br/>\nthe dishes go so you can play in the yard with hime. Offer to do <br/>\nthings you know he likes rather than waiting for him to ask.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There have been times that ds 11 will get into a fight with my dd <br/>\n&gt; 27 and call her really bad names like a d**k sucking Wh***.<br/>\n&gt; At which point she wants to spat him in the mouth,which is when he <br/>\n&gt; will hit her.Mind you this is his birth mother and she is with me <br/>\n&gt; here typing trying to know what the right thing to do in these <br/>\n&gt; situations.She hasn&#39;t gotten the radical approach to unschooling<br/>\n&gt; and I think she is now ready to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like there are a lot of old issues there that need to <br/>\nheal. He has a lot of anger and hurt and frustration that he&#39;s <br/>\ntrying to express to his mom. If she can&#39;t hear that yet then she <br/>\nhas some work to do, personally. In the meantime, it sounds like <br/>\nthey need a mediator.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs a &quot;spat&quot; a slap? If so, well, I have a lot of problems with an <br/>\nadult thinking she has a right to hit a child in the face. I don&#39;t <br/>\ncare what he calls her! If she can&#39;t hear it she needs to leave the <br/>\nroom/house whatever until she calms down enough to respond to his <br/>\nneeds, rather than reacting to his words. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240706223,"authorName":"Tricia","from":"&quot;Tricia&quot; &lt;unskoolerz@...&gt;","profile":"unskoolerz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"sibling rivalry","postDate":"1166303632","msgId":19816,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVtMW5pZys4bHVwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19846,"prevInTime":19815,"nextInTime":19817,"topicId":19816,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all, I haven t posted in a while but as usual I am still here in lurkdom:-) We have been having a great time with our new life and all has gone really well","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1560905132\">Hi all,<br/>\nI haven&#39;t posted in a while but as usual I<br/>\nam still here in lurkdom:-)<br/>\nWe have been having a great time with our <br/>\nnew life and all has gone really well except<br/>\nfor this one problem that I am hoping someone<br/>\nmay have some answers to.<br/>\nMy ds 11 is really being aggresive towards ds 6.<br/>\nHe will want the xbox from him and just takes it<br/>\nfrom ds 6.At which point ds6 will begin to squeal<br/>\nand scream for us to help him.<br/>\nOr ds 6 will be watching t.v.
