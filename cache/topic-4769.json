We re a family of 5: Mom, Dad & 3 children ages 6, 9 & 12.  We do unschool, but have not done","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-111557725\">First, a brief intro as I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done so previously.  We&#39;re a family of 5: Mom, Dad & 3 children ages 6, 9 & 12.  We do unschool, but have not done so for very long, so I certainly have a lot to learn.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne example that came immediately to mind was this:  My husband, overall, truly enjoys his career choice.  However, he is required to attend certain meetings that he finds pointless & that he certainly derives no learning or pleasure from sitting through. (Please allow me to go on, as I think you&#39;ll see that I&#39;m actually agreeing with the majority of you) I realize that, in his case, the *point* of continuing to suffer through these particular meetings (and he has tried to improve them) is to continue in his chosen position in a career that fulfills him.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy impression from the original poster is that the question is really centered around a question of developing self-discipline.  The question seemed to me to be asking:  how will our children achieve the self-discipline to deal with situations that are uninteresting or unappealing?  The brief answer is this:  The self-discipline will automatically kick in if the benefits are appealing enough...if not, the now-adult will choose to skip said activity.  The long answer follows...<br/>\n <br/>\nIf my &quot;take&quot; on the question is correct, then my personal answer would be as follows:  At the adult level, it&#39;s a matter of making a conscious choice.  You weigh the pros/cons of the choice.  If presented with a task that does not seem interesting or seems pointless, then it&#39;s necessary to decide whether or not to pursue it.  Sometimes, the &quot;point&quot; becomes clear when looked at in this way & one will continue to slog through.  Sometimes not.  Either way, you make an informed choice & deal with the consequences.  I don&#39;t know....let&#39;s pick a situation.  Let&#39;s use my example above regarding my husband.  He *does* have a choice.  He *really* dislikes these particular meetings.  However, he also *really* enjoys the rest of the duties he performs in his position.  For him, the benefits outweigh the detriments & he continues on.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHowever, just because he is employed there & enjoys his work, does *not* mean he is *forced* to continue.  He could just as easily choose to leave his place of employment & pursue another direction.  He knows I would support him in whatever decision he chooses to make.  And, no, we&#39;re not independently wealthy (ha. haha. hahahahaha).  Far from it.  I&#39;ve just lived with him both when he&#39;s happy & when he isn&#39;t.  I&#39;ll take happy & fulfilled while eating/living on a pittance over miserable & making lots o&#39; money any time.<br/>\n <br/>\nTaxes...another good example.  I&#39;m sure, somewhere, there are many adults who simply adore doing their taxes.  I&#39;m not one of them.  Taxes are not interesting to me, but I *do* see a point (even if I don&#39;t always agree with it).  I have several choices.  I can do them myself simply because I personally choose to do so, I can hire someone more qualified to do them for me...or....and here&#39;s a shocker....I could choose *not* to do them at all!  Ever.  Now, if I choose that last option, I need to realize that I have also chosen to accept the consequences that go along with that decision, but I *can* choose it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSoooo....that was a long answer, but I hoped it helped some.  Really, if our children achieve the ability to weigh the pros/cons of decisions & also learn to accept responsibility for their choices, then all is well.  In a family who cares for their children & spends time with them...listens to them & converses with them...I can&#39;t imagine these life skills *not* developing.  Does that make any sense?  <br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\n~Lisa~<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DACunefare@...\">DACunefare@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n**When homeschooling the children or while they are in school, isn&#39;t<br/>\nit necessary for kids to learn about things they are NOT interested<br/>\nin or see a point to sometimes because they will come across<br/>\nsituations in life where this will happen when they are adults?**<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople say this all the time, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true.
