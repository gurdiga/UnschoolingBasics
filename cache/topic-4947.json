Basically, we are both there for our kids <br/>\nif a learning opportunity should arise...  Anyways, we do sacrifice <br/>\na house in order to be able to afford to do this.  We live in an <br/>\napartment and drive one older car.  We pay cash for everything in <br/>\norder to stay clear of debt and I basically wear the same clothes <br/>\nconstantly.

Over the last few years I have really worked on being more mindful, less angry (I was such an angry young person), and less defensive.  I have succeeded wonderfully with the first two!  :-}  I am still working on it though, and I appreciate all of your thoughtfulness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have often found parenting sites and lists where I for the most part agreed with the parenting philosophy, only to find that they were very anti- working parent, single parent, daycare, etc, so I ended up getting upset and leaving.  I have come a long way in the area of not letting things get to me, but I do still get defensive sometimes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that many people label daycare, working parents, etc as bad, when really it is the mindset of the parents that they have issues with.

My firstborn will be 5 in May and my second is 18 months.  <br/>\nI am very much an attachment parent, and when ds was little I was very <br/>\ncontrolling about tv watching and food and so on.  I was in a great AP <br/>\nmoms group that I met through La Leche (we started the NM breastfeeding <br/>\ncalendar, if anyone&#39;s seen it).  But, like some of you have experienced, <br/>\nas the kids got older all the moms started wanting more and more <br/>\ncontrol.  Of the original moms group, three of them now do time-outs <br/>\nregularly, one bans all TV and another bans all sugar.  Another mom I <br/>\nknow who is very AP with her babies actually spanks her older ones!  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t get it. I stopped doing time outs when ds was 2 but I was still <br/>\ntrying to control TV and food.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I was doing was actively trying to *teach* him things.  He <br/>\nwas a very verbal baby and toddler and everyone was going on about how <br/>\nintelligent he was so I had a strong impulse to try to make him learn <br/>\nstuff.  You know, I&#39;d show him flash cards or try to get him to <br/>\nrecognize words (being the natural unschooler that he is he totally <br/>\nresisted, which only frustrated me because I knew he could do it).  I <br/>\nalso tried to take him on homeschooling field trips, but he hated those <br/>\ntoo, especially ones where there was an activity to do where he had to <br/>\nfollow instructions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOver the last couple of years I have learned more about radical <br/>\nunschooling and I have really come to understand how valuable it is to <br/>\ngive children control over their own bodies and minds.  I don&#39;t do <br/>\nanything &quot;schooly&quot; with him any more and he has much more control over <br/>\nhis time and what he eats.  So he hasn&#39;t been unschooled all his life, <br/>\nbut I would say that a definite shift occurred in my parenting when he <br/>\nwas 2 going on 3.  Perhaps you could say that&#39;s when *I* became an <br/>\nunschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe other parents already instinctively did this with their kids, so <br/>\nthey wouldn&#39;t have thought to call it unschooling until school age <br/>\ncame.  But for me, the total respect for children that radical <br/>\nunschooling embraces was not something I understood right away.  <br/>\nFortunately for dd, she has benefited from the experience I had with ds <br/>\nand she will be, in my mind, unschooled from birth.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":197421595,"authorName":"Katy Jennings","from":"&quot;Katy Jennings&quot; &lt;kjennings95@...&gt;","profile":"coyotegoddess95","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:curious","postDate":"1109642161","msgId":4968,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTUtREFWMTAyOUY1NkU4MEQ3NTRFMkIyRDEzMUJFNTkwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUwMjI4MTYxNjM1LjUyMTM2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzODA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":4965,"nextInTopic":4972,"prevInTime":4967,"nextInTime":4969,"topicId":4947,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1275724716\">&lt;&lt;Most people I know have their children in daycare by 6 months of age, then pre-school, then off to public.

His most vivid memory was that another child bit him -- repeatedly.  Andy was that kid&#39;s favorite victim.  His story has been enough to convince Dan that he, too, hates school.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!

We have been living an unschooling lifestyle for <br/>\nthe past two years even though my son could have only started <br/>\nkindergarten this past September.  Lots of my friends had their <br/>\nchildren in preschool at age three -- and I&#39;ve heard of people <br/>\nenrolling their TWO year olds in &quot;pre-preschool&quot;, but that&#39;s just <br/>\ndaycare IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, unschooling isn&#39;t *only* about not doing school or <br/>\nschool-at-home.  It also involves a lot of trust and freedom and joyful <br/>\nliving.  Having said that . . . I say we&#39;ve been unschooling for two <br/>\nyears because during the time prior to kindergarten enrollment age I <br/>\n*could* have been sitting down with my DS and making him do pages in <br/>\nPre-K workbooks, making him write the alphabet, making him sound words <br/>\nout, making him do science experiments with me, limiting his TV viewing <br/>\ntime until after his &quot;homework&quot; was finished, etc.  As it turns out, he <br/>\ndid (and enjoys) doing all of those things on his own that I could have <br/>\n*made* him do for &quot;school&quot; (but we don&#39;t limit TV).  Instead, he <br/>\nexperiences freedom and joy and fun when he chooses to do each of those <br/>\nthings and sooooo much more.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Tracy-<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&quot;Yes, Peace *will* enter your life, but you<br/>\n\tneed to clear a spot for her to sit down.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196090915,"authorName":"J.
