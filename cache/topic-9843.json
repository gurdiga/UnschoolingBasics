Obviously the youngest doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncommunicate as well as the older.<br/>\nOften my older seems like he just wants to start an arguement.  He<br/>\ngets so frustrated when his little brother says something that he<br/>\nfeels isn&#39;t right.  We remind him fairly often that the arguement is<br/>\nnot going to help anyone but is only making them both angry.  It only<br/>\nseems to happen if the older is already in a mood that facilitates<br/>\nthis arguementative attitude.  I want him to know his opinions are<br/>\nvalid and valuable without him feeling the need to argue and be<br/>\nright/more right.<br/>\nAnother issue that is only similar in that it is train based is<br/>\nbumping cars.  Anyone familiar with Thomas knows how often the<br/>\nlocomotives end up having to bump the troublesome trucks, though<br/>\nusually the coaches are happy to follow along.<br/>\nMy youngest is more often an engine, instead of a little boy, and<br/>\nmomma and I have been &quot;bumped&quot; pretty hard sometimes.  He will come<br/>\njogging pretty quickly and give us a good jolt.  &quot;STOP HITTING US!&quot;<br/>\nnever worked, but I can generally calm him down by reminding him that<br/>\nwe aren&#39;t cars and don&#39;t need to be bumped.<br/>\nThe bumping isn&#39;t really a problem in and of itself.  The issue with<br/>\nbumping is that sometimes, especially when you don&#39;t see it coming,<br/>\nand with the harder bumps, he does have the ability to hurt someone. <br/>\nI&#39;m always a little worried that the circumstances will work just so<br/>\nthat his bump pushes me into some body twist that throws my back out.<br/>\n While that may sound a bit farfetched, it is an actual concern.<br/>\nI really think that with our patience I&#39;m seeing fewer instances of<br/>\neither activity.  And I&#39;m not even sure if I&#39;m asking a question here<br/>\nor not.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9812,"nextTopicId":9846}}
