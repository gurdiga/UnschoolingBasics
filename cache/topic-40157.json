I still walk out every morning to the bus and drive him often when asked (and pick him up) . I volunteer once a week in the class and try to do things with the pta.  (funny side note though the president of the pta and treasurer is homeschooling their children next year:)  <br/>\n  So I guess I am grasping unschooling more and more and I am aware of my kids more!!   good gut instinct to post for us with schooled kids:)!! thank you<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9485,"nextTopicId":40153}}
