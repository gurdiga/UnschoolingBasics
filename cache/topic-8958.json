So I didn&#39;t mean to generalize all school kids into <br/>\nbeing the same -- I realise it sounded that way at the end of my <br/>\npost.  <br/>\nBut the experiences I&#39;ve had with my niece and nephew in particular <br/>\n(one-upping, cliques, competitiveness) I believe are, at least <br/>\npartly, the result of their school situation.  My nephew&#39;s classroom <br/>\nis very heavily on a reward system with students receiving <br/>\nindividual check marks for good behavior, receiving group check <br/>\nmarks with the row their desk is in, getting the classroom teddy <br/>\nbear to sit on their desk if they get the most check marks, getting <br/>\nspecial treats etc for reading a certain number of books, and the <br/>\nlist goes on.  My nephew has (according to my sil) been very <br/>\nstressed with a little boy in his row who sometimes causes the rest <br/>\nof his row to lose check marks. I can only imagine how that poor <br/>\nlittle guy is ostracised by the rest of his row.  I can just see the <br/>\njeers of the other kids in the winning row to those of the losing <br/>\nrows. I realize that not all schools and classrooms run on such <br/>\nreward systems, but in this particular situation with these <br/>\nparticular kids, their school experiences are affecting our <br/>\nplaydates.  My sil thought the rewards were working so well at <br/>\nschool (making the kids do what the teacher wanted) that she <br/>\nimplemented the same type of reward system at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy niece who is in kindergarten, has had some &#39;friend&#39; troubles <br/>\nalready, and I have no doubts that she is bringing these new &#39;social <br/>\nskills&#39; at play with my kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for my dd1&#39;s reaction to the locked door, she unlocked the door <br/>\nimmediately and let me and dd2 in.  I had a talk with all three <br/>\ngirls about including everyone that wanted to be included, not being <br/>\nmean, etc.  So I&#39;m hoping it was a learning experience for all of <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize it&#39;s silly of me to blame playdate problems on my niece <br/>\nand nephew.  They are, afterall, just innocent little children. My <br/>\nown children are not perfect.  They do fight, say mean things, etc. <br/>\njust like typical siblings.  But like I said before, I do feel my <br/>\nniece and nephew have picked up some negative social skills from <br/>\ntheir school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;multimomma&quot; <br/>\n&lt;autismhelp@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m curious as to how your dd1 reacted to your neice locking #2 <br/>\n </span></blockquote>out of the room.

We went skating at a rink right across <br/>\nfrom your daddy&#39;s work.&quot; <br/>\nDD was just offering what she thought was an exciting piece of <br/>\ninformation.  Niece looked at her and said, &quot;Well ... so?  I&#39;ve been <br/>\nto an even closer one.&quot;<br/>\nThis is just one example.  There is a constant one-upmanship against <br/>\nmy kids going on with this child and her 7yo brother.  I&#39;m beginning <br/>\nto really dislike their company and often wonder if it&#39;s even harmful <br/>\nfor my kids, who honestly do not have a competitive bone in their body.<br/>\nAlso, this niece thrives on exclusionary play.  She&#39;s always cliquing <br/>\nwith one or two of my three children and excluding one.  The other day <br/>\nshe ran into my dd&#39;s room with dd1 and slammed the door behind her <br/>\nleaving dd2 in tears locked out of her own room.  I am tired of <br/>\ndealing with my kids&#39; hurt feelings when these schooled kids are <br/>\naround.  My kids know nothing about cliques and exclusionary play, and <br/>\nI&#39;d like to keep it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I guess I&#39;ve turned this into a rant, but those are my <br/>\nexperiences with schooled kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaria</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95897089,"authorName":"simplemom3","from":"&quot;simplemom3&quot; &lt;sja3k@...&gt;","profile":"simplemom3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Thanks for the advice","postDate":"1137006558","msgId":8959,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRxM2w0dSs4bnZvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRxMjhjZyt1OXBpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8958,"nextInTopic":8962,"prevInTime":8958,"nextInTime":8960,"topicId":8958,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
