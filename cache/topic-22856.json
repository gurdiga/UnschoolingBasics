It involves finding mutually agreed upon solutions, where<br/>\nthe needs of both parties are not only considered but addressed.<br/>\nEveryone&#39;s wants and needs are equally valid, regardless of age.<br/>\nConflicting wants or needs are discussed and mutually agreeable<br/>\nsolutions are created or negotiated which meet the underlying needs of<br/>\nall parties. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeginners to this concept are welcome to join this list, living<br/>\nconsensually is an ongoing process of discovery. We ask that you be<br/>\nopen to or on the path toward living consensually. We hope to explore<br/>\nthe issues by asking questions, and sharing our experiences. Parenting<br/>\nis a sensitive issue for many people but we are all here to practice<br/>\nthis process, and can do so if the environment remains one of respect,<br/>\ncompassion, exploration and understanding.
