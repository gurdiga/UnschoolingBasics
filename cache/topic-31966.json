It was<br/>\nco-edited by me and my son Jason, 27, who unschooled from the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Unmanual has personal stories and essays by unschoolers Nanda Van<br/>\nGestel, Rue Kream, Mary Van Doren, Kim Houssenloge and me, as well as<br/>\na wonderful essay by Daniel Quinn, author of Ishmael, and an excerpt<br/>\nfrom John Holt&#39;s book Learning All the Time. It&#39;s intended for both<br/>\nseasoned and prospective unschoolers, and should also be helpful for<br/>\nskeptical relatives and friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy&#39;s article &quot;What is Unschooling?&quot; will be included in the<br/>\ntranslated editions, and in an expanded edition we hope to have some<br/>\ntime in &#39;09.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo read an excerpt and two book reviews, or to order the book, please<br/>\nvisit <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.org/unmanual/\">http://www.naturalchild.org/unmanual/</a> .<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re very excited about our new book.
