Play games like egg-toss using not only eggs but ripe fruit - and of course more water balloons.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they like big noises, get drums and cymbals. If you can find one, get a piano. Play with resonance and percussion. Smash things (safely!) by throwing or putting them in a bag and hitting them with a hammer. Get a cheap amp and play with amplified sound and (inevitably) feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoosh... you mean fly? Make paper airplanes and gliders. Look for kits and instructions to attach balloons. Get a remote control helicopter. Look into those flexible race-track kits for toy cars. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor tweens, balsa wood cars and small rockets with NO2 cartridges might be fun, if they&#39;re into the process. Play with hot air - make hot air balloons with birthday candles and simple gizmos to twirl over a tea-candle. Play with fire (safely!) on a hearth or in a grill. Get some snap circuits and play with electricity. <br/>\n<br/>\nFireworks - depending on where you are, those are a great source of bangs, flashes and whooshes.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoi and other fire toys are fun, and poi themselves are easy to use:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.renegadejuggling.com/fire-props-c88.html\">http://www.renegadejuggling.com/fire-props-c88.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are LED toys to spin and juggle:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.renegadejuggling.com/glow-props-LED-c206.html\">http://www.renegadejuggling.com/glow-props-LED-c206.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She has found and tried some experiments...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The thing is, there aren&#39;t really any good ones that don&#39;t involve some degree of danger. The bigger the reaction, the more energy is involved - so beyond simply foaming up, that means you&#39;re getting into heat, electricity, and serious chemical reactions. And an impressive reaction takes a lot more time to set up than the reaction itself. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":482982411,"authorName":"Danielle","from":"Danielle &lt;seraphina1974@...&gt;","profile":"daniphina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Things that go bang and whoosh?","postDate":"1347915392","msgId":49044,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMzQjBDQUQxLUUwRDUtNEFCRC04MEQzLTkxQzlEODY3RTVENUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGszN3N1aCtiM3BnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGszN3N1aCtiM3BnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49043,"nextInTopic":49045,"prevInTime":49043,"nextInTime":49045,"topicId":49043,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A tube of mentos in a two liter bottle of diet coke.
