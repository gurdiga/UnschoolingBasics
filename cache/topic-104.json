But give kids a plate of cookies and they figure it out  <br/>\neasily. They *absorb* the meaning of dividing. *Later* they can learn  <br/>\nhow to represent that in formal mathematical notation. But now, when  <br/>\nthey&#39;re younger, it&#39;s a lot more important for them to play and mess  <br/>\naround with mathematical concepts that come up in the course of their  <br/>\nplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt won&#39;t look like school math. It will look like beating a level on  <br/>\na video game but they&#39;ll be learning far more than it looks like.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you teach them -- use workbooks and lessons -- everything they  <br/>\nknow about English? Or did they just use English to explore what  <br/>\ninterested them and get what they wanted and *as a side effect* they  <br/>\ngot better at English.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a mysterious process to most people so most people don&#39;t take it  <br/>\nseriously. Educational experts *do* take Spanish class seriously  <br/>\nbecause they can test kids to show how well they&#39;re &quot;learning&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal life doesn&#39;t work like that. We have feedback from using things  <br/>\nfor real life personally meaningful reasons that helps us figure out  <br/>\nwhether we&#39;re getting it or not. My daughter didn&#39;t have to  <br/>\nunderstand percentages in order to use them in video games. But as  <br/>\nshe used them, and saw them used in other contexts, she refined her  <br/>\nunderstanding. Then seeing how they&#39;re manipulated with mathematical  <br/>\nnotation was a piece of cake because she had a good foundation of  <br/>\nunderstanding what percentages are by using them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>\nprocess is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>\nof what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>\nThey go to college to get a job to buy stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about exploring life. Kids explore their interests and  <br/>\nget better at their interests because they *want* to know more. Their  <br/>\nlife pursuits won&#39;t come from math class. It will come from the  <br/>\nthings that make them jump out of bed in the morning. They *will*  <br/>\nabsorb math because it&#39;s part of life -- as a side effect of living.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be worried if all they seem to want to do is explore video  <br/>\ngames ;-) My daughter watched a lot of cartoons for a couple of  <br/>\nyears. Not because she&#39;ll be  a professional cartoon watcher ;-) but  <br/>\nbecause the storytelling was absorbing for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople fear that kids will avoid math (and history and science and so  <br/>\nforth) because schooled kids will. But those subjects aren&#39;t  <br/>\ninherently boring. Unschooled kids don&#39;t have the experience with  <br/>\ndull textbooks and dull workbooks. Everything is potentially  <br/>\ninteresting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a matter of fact my daughter has essentially done no formal math  <br/>\nyet at 13 decided to take the Statistics class her father teachers at  <br/>\ncollege, then followed it with Contemporary Math and then College  <br/>\nAlgebra *BECAUSE IT&#39;S FUN* for her. (And -- though high marks aren&#39;t  <br/>\nthe goal of unschooling -- she was near the top when not at the top  <br/>\nof the 3 classes -- &quot;competing&quot; against kids who had had years of  <br/>\npreparation. That makes it seem as though preparation has the  <br/>\nopposite effect!) She doesn&#39;t have 12 years of experience with math  <br/>\nbeing dull so she takes it because it&#39;s an interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244909672,"authorName":"freepsgal","from":"&quot;freepsgal&quot; &lt;freepsgal@...&gt;","profile":"freepsgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: hello","postDate":"1151459018","msgId":15010,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU3c21zYStsN3UxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU3cnBxYStldTllQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15005,"nextInTopic":15018,"prevInTime":15009,"nextInTime":15011,"topicId":104,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
