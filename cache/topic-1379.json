You probably realize that now....you need <br/>\nreal friends, not people just trying to suck your life energy.<br/>\nTrue friendships consist of give and take and leave you feeling <br/>\nenergized, healthy, fulfilled.<br/>\nI really hope you can find some people that will bring positive <br/>\nenergy into your life, and learn to say NO to the rest of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t read anything here that suggested you just go away and <br/>\nmedicate to fix everything. Although, if medication gets someone <br/>\nthrough a rough spot, more power to them! Getting help can mean a <br/>\nmyriad of things...<br/>\nCounseling, alternative therapies, hypnosis, medication, creating <br/>\nsupport networks and so on....<br/>\nWhat I read said &quot;I hope you get some help&quot;, not &quot;I hope you drug <br/>\nyourself into a stupor.&quot; :) Help means just that, HELP. In whatever <br/>\nform assists you the most.<br/>\nYes, many geniuses think differently, many brilliant minds suffer <br/>\ndepression or ups and downs of the passionate spirit. That doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean they didn&#39;t/don&#39;t need help at times, to get out of that dark <br/>\nplace. We all need help at times.<br/>\nYou said yourself, you felt &quot;broken&quot;, so the responses are going to <br/>\nreflect back what you yourself said. That doesn&#39;t mean &quot;less than&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you come here and tell us these very stressful things in your <br/>\nlife, you&#39;re probably going to get a bunch of responses saying &quot;take <br/>\ncontrol&quot;. That&#39;s how unschoolers tend to think!:)<br/>\nI&#39;ve read enough about your life and this very difficult place <br/>\nyou&#39;re in to know that you CAN control a lot of it. There&#39;s a lot <br/>\nyou have no control over (like dh going to Iraq) and that&#39;s why it&#39;s <br/>\nessential to make choices and change things where you can.<br/>\nI feel for ya!<br/>\nI know it&#39;s really, really difficult to change that victim mentality <br/>\nwhen you&#39;ve been abused. It sounds like you&#39;re completely aware and <br/>\ntaking steps to change things....that&#39;s great.<br/>\nJust expect the advice here to run to the side of making different <br/>\nchoices and saying NO more. Try to see it as support, not a put-<br/>\ndown...that&#39;s really what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving been in a deep depression I saw no way out of (also an <br/>\nenvironmental thing, not a chemical imbalance) I KNOW for a fact <br/>\nthat sometimes you need a helping hand. Try to find some positive <br/>\nspirits to be your guides....you can change everything, it&#39;s as easy <br/>\nas standing up for yourself, it&#39;s as hard as changing a lifetime of <br/>\nthinking patterns.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;ll find unschooling unfolding more joyfully as you take <br/>\nsteps towards ridding your life of these negative energy suckers <br/>\nyou&#39;re surrounded by right now. First step, get rid of the roomate.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1343,"nextTopicId":1360}}
