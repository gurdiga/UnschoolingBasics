I&#39;m <br/>\nreally touched by your kindness that you would take the time to read <br/>\nand respond.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for those who shared their situations with me.  Apraxia is  <br/>\nvery confusing and frustrating.  My son has worked very, very hard to <br/>\nbe able to speak clearly because it was more than important to him, <br/>\neven at a very young age, that people understand him.  I remember him <br/>\nsobbing because I could not understand what he was saying even at the <br/>\nage of 3.  Now his articulation is very good but he struggles to be <br/>\nable to explain what happened or what he saw etc.  He wants very much <br/>\nto be part of conversations.  Apraxia affects the ability to motor <br/>\nplan but it does not affect intelligence.  Someone told me once that <br/>\nyou could liken it to someone with a stroke.  They KNOW what they <br/>\nwant to say but the messages get mixed up on the way to the mouth.  <br/>\nRight now I find the hardest part to be that some people believe that <br/>\nsince he CAN articulate words correctly or near correctly that he <br/>\nshould be able to answer their questions or test verbally.  They do <br/>\nnot understand that it&#39;s more complicated, that saying a word in <br/>\nisolation is one thing but putting it in a sentence is a whole <br/>\ndifferent ball of wax.  Does he really need the SLP?  I&#39;m on the <br/>\nfence so I think as long as he wants to go see her I&#39;ll keep taking <br/>\nhim.  I do think a talk with her is in order though as several of you <br/>\nsuggested.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the gymnastics - I spoke to the owner/head coach and he has NO <br/>\nproblem with my being there.  He apologized that the woman upstairs <br/>\nhad frightened my son and said he would speak to her.  I was also <br/>\nable to speak to one other coach and she was very understanding.  She <br/>\nsaid that what ever I needed to do was fine with her and she <br/>\ncommended me for taking the time to be there for him.  As for the two <br/>\nother coaches that think he should &quot;Get over it&quot;, oh <br/>\nwell!                <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, Brian thank you very much for your list of <br/>\nsuggestions/reading.  I&#39;ve got book order to go do! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you again!<br/>\nSarah</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139136574,"authorName":"Jeanette Crichton","from":"Jeanette Crichton &lt;jeanettec_99@...&gt;","profile":"jeanettec_99","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Looking for insight! - LONG!

The<br/>\nbest thing about homeschooling is being able to help your child as you see<br/>\nfit. the hard part is having to constantly research how to do it.

My husband often sleeps in a separate room from me<br/>\ncause I have one kid and he has another since we have three sometimes one of<br/>\nus has more then one.

We discussed <br/>\nonly going upstairs to use the bathroom and to eat and not giving the <br/>\nwoman any chance to be grumpy but come the next camp day he stayed 10 <br/>\nminutes and started crying that his stomach hurt. I took him home <br/>\nand we spent the next week just hanging out and we bought a 4 square <br/>\nball to practice the &quot;stupid game&quot; ;) Now he is willing to go but <br/>\nhe&#39;s asked that I stay the entire time. I&#39;ve done that two days and <br/>\nam very willing to do it (he has 3 more days required to attend) <br/>\nbut &quot;other&quot; people have expressed concern that he has SEPERATION <br/>\nproblems. I&#39;m worried about the way the coaches and the other kids <br/>\nwill treat him. Already one coach told him gruffly not to worry <br/>\nabout his mom. I had gone to the bathroom, thinking he saw where I <br/>\nwent but he hadn&#39;t and he thought I left and started crying.

The day I came home from the hospital with my daughter, it was, IMHO, the wisest piece of advice any one ever gave me. &quot;Follow your gut, only you truly know that child.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI found it is wiser to &quot;pick your battles&quot; with your children. The point of home schooling is that you decide what your children are learning and what their assignments are. Thank the counselor for her advice but that you know what works best for your son at home. Maybe look into something that will work for you and your son and let the counselor know about it and ask her to help you gauge his progress from there. I stuttered when I was growing up and did quite well without therapy, I work in a call center. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for co-sleeping, we have done that with both of our children. My daughter chose to go into her own bed in her own time. My son still sleeps with us some nights. Honestly, I didn&#39;t know there was a name for it when we started co-sleeping. It started from total exhaustion, I simply brought my daughter to bed with us so she could nurse at her leisure and I could still get some sleep. It worked so well we did with our son as well. I swear that is why they made large beds. <br/>\n<br/>\nSeparation anxiety. That is a lovely term that I have had explained to me as &quot;mom it&#39;s time to let go of the little one&quot;. Not true. I lost a part of my daughter when she went to public school and came under the influence of children whose parents do not have the same values we do. The school systems we have been in do not have the same values as we do. No it&#39;s not time to let go until they are ready to go out in the world on their own. And how will they do that successfully? From learning from us, their parents. Our mistakes, our triumphs influence them. Making them grow up at such young ages doesn&#39;t prepare them for the world it causes them more problems in the long run, they miss out on the fun of being a child. Playing, having fun, no large cares to consider. <br/>\n<br/>\nTammy C.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205985732,"authorName":"A Perry","from":"A Perry &lt;ansperry@...&gt;","profile":"ansperry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Looking for insight! - LONG!","postDate":"1217812166","msgId":35108,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU2MTIzMy43NzczNy5xbUB3ZWIzMzIwNi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGc3NDNiZitmYnAzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35100,"nextInTopic":35109,"prevInTime":35107,"nextInTime":35109,"topicId":35095,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear Sarah,   My son is 6 years old.

This makes many people believe","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-848909929\">Dear Sarah,<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son is 6 years old. He is larger than any other boy his age that I have met- all over larger, not just heavy. This makes many people believe that he is older than he is, and they expect him to act in a more &quot;mature&quot; way than he does. Your story struck a chord with me because I have also had other adults treat my son with disrespect and scorn because of his &quot;clinginess&quot; and &quot;separation anxiety&quot;. My own husband agrees with them, and sometimes refers to my son, behind his back, as &quot;The Barnacle&quot;. I hate this, and it causes some tension in the house, but I am not going to allow anyone to question my instincts about what I know is truly best for my boy, not even my husband.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe spent part of last year in kindergarten because I thought it would be fun. I really thought kindergarten would be more about playing and meeting other children than about obeying and listening and keeping quiet and sitting still. What a shock I received when I started volunteering at the school because my son was clearly NOT having fun and would cry when we started getting ready for school each morning. About 8 weeks into the school year I pulled him out, and he has been home with me every day since. We still sleep together in the family bed. I go with him everywhere that he wants to go- science camp, soccer, art class, etc. I check to make sure that my presence is acceptable before signing up for activities. I even sit next to him on the floor during the local library story hour. This is all because he *wants* me there. He *wants* to be with me, close to me, as much as possible. <br/>\n <br/>\nDon&#39;t doubt your instincts to take care of your son and to stay close to him. I think that when you do what is right, it feels right, and when you do what is &quot;wrong&quot;, you can change and try something else until you find the &quot;right&quot; thing.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for the teacher, I would ask her to consider working with you in a different way. There must be some other way for your son to get help from her. Have you really brainstormed about other ways? I would seriously think long and hard about what the goal is and how to get there without the pain and struggle you and he are experiencing. And then go to her with your ideas. If he is not participating, he has a good reason. You could talk with him about what&#39;s not working, and find out what his thoughts and ideas are. When I talk with my son and he tells me his thoughts and ideas, he has solved some pretty serious problems.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne last thing- don&#39;t worry about &quot;being an unschooler&quot;. Just be you, and your son&#39;s mom. Your goals will change, and so will his. Your interests, your energy level, your motivation, and his- it&#39;s all between you and him. If you are doing what you and he want, when you and he want, then you are &quot;unschoolers&quot;. What happens between the two of you is what will define your unschooling days and your unschooling life. You guys are in charge! Enjoy it.<br/>\n <br/>\nAngela<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [SPAM?] [unschoolingbasics] Looking for insight! - LONG!","postDate":"1217806417","msgId":35099,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwODAzMTYzM3EyMmYzZTczNGdiZjY5MGJkNzIwNWFlYWM4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRBRDIyMzA3RTFGMTRDRkY5RjE3NjlEOEZDQkM5NUIwQGp1ZHlQQz4=","referencesHeader":"PGc3NDNiZitmYnAzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEFEMjIzMDdFMUYxNENGRjlGMTc2OUQ4RkNCQzk1QjBAanVkeVBDPg=="},"prevInTopic":35098,"nextInTopic":35100,"prevInTime":35098,"nextInTime":35100,"topicId":35095,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I agree Judy.

It&#39;s a systematic attempt to de-emotionalize<br/>\nboys.  Girls are encouraged to emote all they want to.  Boys are put down<br/>\nand shamed for shows of emotion.  If I were to allow that to happen to my<br/>\nson, and it has happened because of the way the culture is, then the natural<br/>\noutcome is for boys to conclude that the only acceptable emotion is ANGER.<br/>\nDay to day life is supposed to be the other alternative --- stuff your<br/>\nemotions...... which just starts a huge backlog that eventually comes out as<br/>\nreally big anger.  Hello?  Awful cycle.  Boys are human beings and don&#39;t<br/>\nneed to live up to the &quot;strong silent&quot; stereotype.  They need a full range<br/>\nof expression, not to be bottled and seen as &quot;bad&quot; for having feelings,<br/>\nwhich are unavoidable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bond of mother and son is a fine one and not to be messed with in my<br/>\nopinion.

He attended K in a public school only to have<br/>\n&gt; several incidents with adults that frightened him (teachers yelling,<br/>\n&gt; principal refusing to let me take him out of school when he was sick<br/>\n&gt; so she restrained him and ordered me out of the school etc) and<br/>\n&gt; repeated incidents with a child bullying him. So since late Sept of<br/>\n&gt; this year we pulled him from PS and I&#39;ve been trying to learn about<br/>\n&gt; unschooling. I&#39;ll admit that not all of it comes easy to me, but I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; trying. Which leads me to my first problem. He attends speech<br/>\n&gt; therapy with a private SLP for verbal apraxia. He likes her and goes<br/>\n&gt; willingly. Problem is that she is asking me to do &quot;homework&quot; with<br/>\n&gt; him and what he might do willingly for her, he does NOT want to do at<br/>\n&gt; home with me. She has him writing short stories trying to help him<br/>\n&gt; learn to be more comfortable with whole language. He does not want<br/>\n&gt; to write ANY thing at home. It becomes a real battle which makes<br/>\n&gt; both of us miserable. I&#39;ve told the SLP this and that I don&#39;t want<br/>\n&gt; to force him to do it. She says that I should never have to force<br/>\n&gt; him so it&#39;s the way I&#39;m presenting it. She told me instead of asking<br/>\n&gt; him to do the work that I should set a timer, then it&#39;s his choice to<br/>\n&gt; do the work or not. She said that she thinks he should go back to<br/>\n&gt; school because he doesn&#39;t have any problems doing the work for her.<br/>\n&gt; Of course that hooks into my fears that I&#39;m doing it &quot;wrong&quot;. This<br/>\n&gt; is a child that tests out at having a moderate to severe language<br/>\n&gt; disability and graphomotor disabilites but who is very bright. Thing<br/>\n&gt; is he becomes VERY frustrated and angry when he can&#39;t get his point<br/>\n&gt; across.

My son<br/>\n&gt; turned 7 at the end of April. He is on a gymnastics team and loves<br/>\n&gt; it. Problem: all team members have to attend gymnastics camp which<br/>\n&gt; entails 2 weeks of 3 days a week from 9:00 - 4:00. He attended one<br/>\n&gt; day willingly and when I went in at 3:00 to watch and pick him up I<br/>\n&gt; found him pale and near tears. I asked him if he was okay and he<br/>\n&gt; told me, &quot;Some of it&#39;s fun but there&#39;s a stupid game and the lady<br/>\n&gt; upstairs was mad at me.&quot; There&#39;s another exercise business<br/>\n&gt; upstairs and the woman is retired military and very aggressive.<br/>\n&gt; Turns out he was dropping a bean bag down over the balcony and she<br/>\n&gt; told him to, &quot;Get out of here&quot; and gave the thumb jerk. We discussed<br/>\n&gt; only going upstairs to use the bathroom and to eat and not giving the<br/>\n&gt; woman any chance to be grumpy but come the next camp day he stayed 10<br/>\n&gt; minutes and started crying that his stomach hurt. I took him home<br/>\n&gt; and we spent the next week just hanging out and we bought a 4 square<br/>\n&gt; ball to practice the &quot;stupid game&quot; ;) Now he is willing to go but<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s asked that I stay the entire time. I&#39;ve done that two days and<br/>\n&gt; am very willing to do it (he has 3 more days required to attend)<br/>\n&gt; but &quot;other&quot; people have expressed concern that he has SEPERATION<br/>\n&gt; problems.

He doen&#39;t need organized classes for anything - kids are the most natural gymnasts in the world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStrangers who don&#39;t know our children have no right making value judgements about how we choose to raise our children. Don&#39;t let them make you feel guilty, don&#39;t give in to them, don&#39;t listen to them.  You don&#39;t need them and your son certainly doesn&#39;t - keep reading about unschooling here and anything else you can get your hands on - <br/>\n<br/>\nwhat&#39;s important is the authentic connection between you and your child - school doesn&#39;t do that and our culture has come to believe that it must break the bond between parents and children (especially *mothers* and sons!) - does the term &quot;patriarchy&quot; come to mind?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s very hard to resist the interference of family and people close to you when they are telling you you are wrong - but hang tough my dear - you owe it to your son.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and much empathy...Judy R. in kingston ontario<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: srmccann2003 <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, August 03, 2008 7:04 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [SPAM?] [unschoolingbasics] Looking for insight! - LONG!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not sure if any of you will remember me, I wrote once about my <br/>\n  son previously. He attended K in a public school only to have <br/>\n  several incidents with adults that frightened him (teachers yelling, <br/>\n  principal refusing to let me take him out of school when he was sick <br/>\n  so she restrained him and ordered me out of the school etc) and <br/>\n  repeated incidents with a child bullying him. So since late Sept of <br/>\n  this year we pulled him from PS and I&#39;ve been trying to learn about <br/>\n  unschooling. I&#39;ll admit that not all of it comes easy to me, but I&#39;m <br/>\n  trying. Which leads me to my first problem. He attends speech <br/>\n  therapy with a private SLP for verbal apraxia. He likes her and goes <br/>\n  willingly. Problem is that she is asking me to do &quot;homework&quot; with <br/>\n  him and what he might do willingly for her, he does NOT want to do at <br/>\n  home with me. She has him writing short stories trying to help him <br/>\n  learn to be more comfortable with whole language. He does not want <br/>\n  to write ANY thing at home. It becomes a real battle which makes <br/>\n  both of us miserable. I&#39;ve told the SLP this and that I don&#39;t want <br/>\n  to force him to do it. She says that I should never have to force <br/>\n  him so it&#39;s the way I&#39;m presenting it. She told me instead of asking <br/>\n  him to do the work that I should set a timer, then it&#39;s his choice to <br/>\n  do the work or not. She said that she thinks he should go back to <br/>\n  school because he doesn&#39;t have any problems doing the work for her. <br/>\n  Of course that hooks into my fears that I&#39;m doing it &quot;wrong&quot;. This <br/>\n  is a child that tests out at having a moderate to severe language <br/>\n  disability and graphomotor disabilites but who is very bright. Thing <br/>\n  is he becomes VERY frustrated and angry when he can&#39;t get his point <br/>\n  across. That is what drives me to take him to this private SLP <br/>\n  especially since he likes her BUT I&#39;m uncomfortable with what she is <br/>\n  asking me to do at home. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Second problem, and I apologize for the length of this! My son <br/>\n  turned 7 at the end of April. He is on a gymnastics team and loves <br/>\n  it. Problem: all team members have to attend gymnastics camp which <br/>\n  entails 2 weeks of 3 days a week from 9:00 - 4:00. He attended one <br/>\n  day willingly and when I went in at 3:00 to watch and pick him up I <br/>\n  found him pale and near tears. I asked him if he was okay and he <br/>\n  told me, &quot;Some of it&#39;s fun but there&#39;s a stupid game and the lady <br/>\n  upstairs was mad at me.&quot; There&#39;s another exercise business <br/>\n  upstairs and the woman is retired military and very aggressive. <br/>\n  Turns out he was dropping a bean bag down over the balcony and she <br/>\n  told him to, &quot;Get out of here&quot; and gave the thumb jerk. We discussed <br/>\n  only going upstairs to use the bathroom and to eat and not giving the <br/>\n  woman any chance to be grumpy but come the next camp day he stayed 10 <br/>\n  minutes and started crying that his stomach hurt. I took him home <br/>\n  and we spent the next week just hanging out and we bought a 4 square <br/>\n  ball to practice the &quot;stupid game&quot; ;) Now he is willing to go but <br/>\n  he&#39;s asked that I stay the entire time. I&#39;ve done that two days and <br/>\n  am very willing to do it (he has 3 more days required to attend) <br/>\n  but &quot;other&quot; people have expressed concern that he has SEPERATION <br/>\n  problems. I&#39;m worried about the way the coaches and the other kids <br/>\n  will treat him. Already one coach told him gruffly not to worry <br/>\n  about his mom. I had gone to the bathroom, thinking he saw where I <br/>\n  went but he hadn&#39;t and he thought I left and started crying. This is <br/>\n  a child that still co-sleeps so I&#39;m hearing pressure even from his <br/>\n  Dad about his not being able to separate and how I&#39;m creating <br/>\n  problems for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think it&#39;s bad enough that I question myself that I&#39;m not creative <br/>\n  enough to do unschooling but to have people suggesting that I&#39;m <br/>\n  actually hurting him by not teaching him enough or that I&#39;m coddling <br/>\n  him is making me lose sleep. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I respect a lot of what I&#39;ve read here over the months, does anyone <br/>\n  have insight on my situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thank you for taking the time to read this!<br/>\n  Sarah <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140583341,"authorName":"srmccann2003","from":"&quot;srmccann2003&quot; &lt;smccann@...&gt;","profile":"srmccann2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Looking for insight! - LONG!","postDate":"1217761455","msgId":35095,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc3NDNiZitmYnAzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":35097,"prevInTime":35094,"nextInTime":35096,"topicId":35095,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m not sure if any of you will remember me, I wrote once about my son previously.
