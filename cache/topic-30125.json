They<br/>\nmake no money for doing any of this, so I trust their motives more<br/>\nthan any HSLDA type group (think FPEA here).<br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell you that I had social services called on my in Florida<br/>\nbecause my children were playing outside during school hours. The<br/>\nissue was cleared up immediately when I showed them we homeschooled<br/>\nunder an umbrella school. It was scary for a second, but if you&#39;re<br/>\nlegal in FL there is absolutely no reason to worry. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you decide to go with the umbrella school option, you will need to<br/>\ninform your local school district that you are registered with, that<br/>\nyou are terminating your homeschool program. You can simply write them<br/>\na letter stating that you are removing (fill in children&#39;s names) from<br/>\ntheir district&#39;s homeschooling program and that&#39;s it. If they want to<br/>\nknow anything more, you can simply say &quot;we&#39;re putting them in a<br/>\nprivate school&quot; to avoid confrontation. They have no right to ask that<br/>\nlegally, but it&#39;s an easy way to avoid a bunch of nosy school personnel.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, former Floridian<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"&quot;Karen Swanay&quot; &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] FL&#39;s laws was: PAC","postDate":"1203559779","msgId":30130,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwMjIwMTgwOXk0YTA4MzVmZXE0ZWJkMWYwNGMzNDgyMTJkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAyMjEyMDA4MDE1OC44MTA0LjQ3QkNEQUM2MDAwQzA0OTEwMDAwMUZBODIyMjMwNzAzNjI5QjBBMDJEMjA4OUI5QTAxOUMwNDA0MEEwREJGMEEwQzBFMDAwQTA0MEQ5RDBFMDNAYXR0Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAyMjEyMDA4MDE1OC44MTA0LjQ3QkNEQUM2MDAwQzA0OTEwMDAwMUZBODIyMjMwNzAzNjI5QjBBMDJEMjA4OUI5QTAxOUMwNDA0MEEwREJGMEEwQzBFMDAwQTA0MEQ5RDBFMDNAYXR0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":30125,"nextInTopic":30133,"prevInTime":30129,"nextInTime":30131,"topicId":30125,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well this may have been part of my problem...I didn t know about HSLDA.
