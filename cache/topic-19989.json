I&#39;m resting on the couch just trying to ease the pain away.<br/>\nDH took the older two to the movies and my 3yr old stayed with me. He<br/>\ngot his own snack of crackers and cheese and decided to pour all the<br/>\ncrackers into one tiny bag and asked me to close the bag. (you know<br/>\nthe party cracker packs with 4-5 varieties?) Not being in a very<br/>\npositive mood, I grumbled something to the effect that he should have<br/>\nleft the others closed up (he opened all the packages, even the ones<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t like). I told him to get one more bag and put some in the<br/>\nnew bag. 5 minutes later, he comes to me with 5 ziploz bags filled<br/>\nwith crackers, all separated by variety, telling me that he put the<br/>\ncircles in this bag, brown sqare ones in here, an so on... I just had<br/>\nto laugh and hug him... left to his own, he came up wth his own<br/>\nsolution and did so with much more creativity than I would have<br/>\nanticipated from him at that moment...<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 10 minutes later, the kids came home and he excitedly met them<br/>\nat the door explaining what he did all by himself - mind you I didn&#39;t<br/>\ntalk to him about it at all.<br/>\n<br/>\njust had to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nalison</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19978,"nextTopicId":19931}}
