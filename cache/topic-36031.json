He needed almost constant interaction when he was little, for <br/>\nsure, and we were living in the woods in a commune. Can&#39;t blame the <br/>\ntv on that one ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMo, otoh, is much more of an introvert. She&#39;s had unlimited movies <br/>\nfrom toddlerhood and unlimited satellite tv for a couple years, now, <br/>\nplus video games. She&#39;s definately a very busy person - always <br/>\nbuilding or creating something, it seems. The tv is often on at the <br/>\nsame time if she&#39;s inside, but she doesn&#39;t seem distracted by it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;He said when a child comes<br/>\n&gt; into a place, he takes off his Ipod and needs something else to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>replace it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or he&#39;ll go to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that child - maybe he goes to school and is worn out <br/>\nafter a long day? I&#39;m being facetious, but only slightly. I can <br/>\nthink of plenty of reasons for a school kid to be so utterly wiped <br/>\nout as to doze off if not actively kept awake - or just so utterly <br/>\nbored, for that matter. That doesn&#39;t really apply to my family.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 14)<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35866,"nextTopicId":35889}}
