He said &quot;mom, I think<br/>\nthis will work can we try it.&quot; I said &quot;sure&quot;. I said &quot;where do you want to<br/>\nstart?&quot; He decided on starting at &quot;level 1&quot; which is first grade.

At that time he had about 10 words.  After throwing up for 14 hours and having diarrhea for weeks his 10 words went down to 4 words.  He even stopped saying &quot;Momma&quot; and would just use &quot;mm&quot;.  A friend of mine has a son just 11 days older than my son and her son had to be hospitalized for over a week due to dehydration from the same virus.  The doctors told me the only reason my son didn&#39;t become dehydrated was because I was still nursing him.  The thing is his speech did not come back in the same way after that.  He would try to speak but it was extremely garbled.  People would say, &quot;Boy when he learns to talk he&#39;ll sure have a lot to say!&quot;.  The diarrhea lasted for several months and he lost a lot of weight along with those words and no new words came.  I now tell people that I am VERY thankful for what ever prompted me to introduce him to &quot;Baby Signs&quot; at 10 months of age forward.  BTW, he especially liked the Signing Time series because there are children doing the signs and they use very catchy music.     <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I used signs as I was speaking to him and my son learned them and made up his own signs all over the place.  I have video of him using almost all sign language at the age of 3.  I believe the problem for him was that it wasn&#39;t fast enough or enough people didn&#39;t understand because he would get VERY frustrated when someone didn&#39;t understand what he was saying/signing.  He was also unsure if someone understood unless the person would repeat back to him what they thought he was saying.  In other words you couldn&#39;t just nod and say, &quot;Uh huh&quot;, he&#39;d test you to make SURE you knew!  Once a very happy go lucky child, he developed a powerful and quick temper when frustrated.  That issue still continues to this day.  Would it have been that way without the speech apraxia?  Maybe so, who knows and I guess it doesn&#39;t really matter.  What matters to me is supporting what he wanted and he wanted to speak.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a number of children that I know who were basically unable to speak until almost age 4 and then began to speak clearly on their own.  I have two nephews in fact and they never showed any distress at not being understood.  But my son wanted in a very strong way to communicate verbally.  He&#39;d get down right MAD or worse very depressed.   He needed help.  He has a neurological problem that makes the motor planning of speech very, very difficult.  It is not a speech impediment nor a developmental issue.  Me?  I would have been fine with sign or even a telecommunications device.  Instead he decided that he wanted to speak, he even refused to use PECS (using pictures to communicate) and he was very adamant about which speech therapists he liked and which he refused to go to.  During this I began to believe that my job as a parent was (and is) to support my son in his choices and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve attempted to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve written all this because I want people to be introduced to the idea that it might be fine to let some children &quot;grow out of it&quot; but there are others that wont.
