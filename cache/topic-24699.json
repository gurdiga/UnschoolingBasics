We&#39;ll be in<br/>\nDenver tuesday thru sunday and then going to Boulder<br/>\nand up into the mountains. We would love to go to a<br/>\npark day while there or meet other unschoolers. I have<br/>\n2 kids - 8 year old girl and 5 yr old boy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI searched on the web and found several homeschooling<br/>\norganizations and one even with a park day, but the<br/>\nweb-site was set up such that you had to become a<br/>\nmember and pay your dues before you could get<br/>\ninformation about the park day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you&#39;d like to meet us or have helpful<br/>\ninformation about park day, what to see in Denver etc,<br/>\ncontact me off-list at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:m_kher@...\">m_kher@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nManisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYahoo! oneSearch: Finally, mobile search <br/>\nthat gives answers, not web links. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.yahoo.com/mobileweb/onesearch?refer=1ONXIC\">http://mobile.yahoo.com/mobileweb/onesearch?refer=1ONXIC</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24679,"nextTopicId":24604}}
