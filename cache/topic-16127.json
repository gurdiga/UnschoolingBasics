I&#39;m a coward about needles in<br/>\ngeneral (I can just about manage to get blood drawn<br/>\neach year to check some medical stuff but that takes<br/>\nlots of relaxing breathing just to get the needle in<br/>\nand there&#39;s no permanent marks or anything left).&quot;<br/>\nMine wasn&#39;t painful at all. I did have to have the<br/>\nartist stop a lot. My tattoo is located on my right<br/>\nthigh, right in the middle, on the side. I needed him<br/>\nto stop because I had huge giggle fits. However, the<br/>\ntiny, I think she weighted (I&#39;m a big girl) 100&#39;s lbs<br/>\nsoaking weight, 18 yo girl came in and got a tattoo in<br/>\nthe same spot and she was in pain. I felt bad for her.<br/>\nEspecailly as I was laughing during mine. I don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhy it tickled when he went over the back of my thigh.<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m just weird. <br/>\n&quot;So, swelling afterward? irritation? pain (mild to<br/>\nsevere)? etc. What kind of afterward-care is needed?<br/>\n(like with piercings that need certain types of<br/>\ncleansing and such when they&#39;re fresh)&quot;<br/>\nAfter 6 years, mine still swells sometimes. So, does<br/>\nmy husbands. We just used lotion, although I used<br/>\nbagbalm too. I would say that between tattoos and<br/>\npiercings, I can&#39;t really say which one I liked more.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t think any hurt. But then again, I must be<br/>\nwired differently. I hope this helps. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we took a holiday... Took some time to celebrate... Just one day out of life... It would be so nice...<br/>\nDanie<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!

But the pain is temporary and the tattoo is forever so it&#39;s worth<br/>\nit  if it&#39;s important to you. I didn&#39;t have swelling afterwards but  itching<br/>\nwhen it was healing. You shouldn&#39;t scratch but smacking it helps a  lot. DO<br/>\nNOT use NEOSPORIN on it!!!!! I did cuz I ran out if the stuff they  gave me<br/>\nand I had to get it redone! Neosporin heals it from the inside out  and<br/>\npushes out the ink. Use Bacitracin (sp?) only. After care is pretty  simple<br/>\nand a good tattoo shop will inform you of all aftercare in writing  and give<br/>\nyou the stuff you will  need.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI thought is was OK, felt like a scratch over and over again.  Not  bad.  I <br/>\nused neosporin after, per the written instructions the tattooist  gave me.  And <br/>\nmine healed fine and looks great.  I didn&#39;t think it  hurt much afterward.<br/>\nJust my experience.<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16149,"nextTopicId":16178}}
