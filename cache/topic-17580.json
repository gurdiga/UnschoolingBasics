This would accomplish two things. It would help you understand the richness of these games and shows. It would also provide a vehicle for you to spend time in relationship to her. <br/>\nI have found that when I am feeling critical of my child, it coincides with when I am not relating to him. My criticism and sense that something is gravely wrong about what he is doing diminishes when I find a way to join him in something. Usually my preconceptions and gut feelings do not coincide with the reality of what something is like for him. <br/>\nLast winter, my husband, son and I all played characters on World of Warcraft together. It was our family activity. We had lots of fun and got to interact and problem solve in a lively way. Recently I watched episodes of the anime series Naruto with my son. This allowed me to talk with him about something that intrested him. These turned out to be the right moves on my part and not my worries and criticisms.<br/>\nBest, Andrea <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":213809267,"authorName":"jlh44music","from":"&quot;jlh44music&quot; &lt;jlh44music@...&gt;","profile":"jlh44music","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: TV and Video Games","postDate":"1159209633","msgId":17588,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVmOTdyMStyNW1pQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVmN3I5bytuOHNqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17587,"nextInTopic":17596,"prevInTime":17587,"nextInTime":17589,"topicId":17580,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... games are not  a good thing in unlimited amounts,.

Have they always unschooled or were they <br/>\never in school?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd is 14 and was in school up through 6th grade.  She&#39;s been <br/>\ndeschooling (healing) for over a year, which means mostly playing on <br/>\nthe computer (now it&#39;s almost exclusively World of Warcraft), but <br/>\nalso sometimes video games or TV.   For me it&#39;s hard to imagine that <br/>\nshe wouldn&#39;t get &quot;bored&quot;, but that&#39;s MY point of view, because I <br/>\nhave many different interests and don&#39;t like to do the same thing <br/>\nday in and day out.  It doesn&#39;t mean she isn&#39;t thriving (and <br/>\nhealing) - she has the freedom and space to learn more about who she <br/>\nis.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had migraine headaches and anxiety towards the end of her last <br/>\nyear in middle school very frequently.  This has all disappeared.  <br/>\nShe is also more confident; she used to be hesitent about expressing <br/>\nherself except to those she was most comfortable with, now she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t hesitate because she&#39;s had time to clear out some of the <br/>\ncrap from being in school, and had time to listen to her own <br/>\nthoughts (if you will... not sure how to explain that right now).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also enjoys our camping trips (bike riding, visiting places, <br/>\nhanging in front of the campfire - we&#39;ve had some GREAT <br/>\nconversations as a family this summer there).  She&#39;s been able to <br/>\nsleep as much as she wants (and, yes, stay up late, she&#39;s always <br/>\nbeen a night owl, plus she&#39;s a teen! they often morph into night <br/>\nowls even if they weren&#39;t before), eat when she&#39;s hungry, deal with <br/>\nstarting her period last fall (which was rough for her, even though <br/>\nshe knew all about what to expect), something that would have been <br/>\nvery stressful for her if she had been in school - it took a few <br/>\nmonths, now she takes it in her stride.   She never liked to read <br/>\nfor pleasure.   Her typing and spelling has improved tremendously <br/>\nbecause of chatting on line.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany others here can write about the benefits of choice and TV/video <br/>\ngames, much better than I can.

(not that my DS sits still all that much when he&#39;s watching TV <br/>\nor playing videogames anyhow though lol). Most likely it&#39;s because <br/>\nwe&#39;ve been trained and conditioned to see the printed page as <br/>\nsomething &quot;worthwhile&quot; but TV is &quot;trash&quot;, right? Reading is <br/>\nbroccoli, TV is Fritos. But, what do you then do with people who <br/>\nlearn BEST by hearing sound, seeing color, absorbing movement, <br/>\nrather than through black text on white paper? Perhaps reading a bit <br/>\non learning styles might help there (since it has the imprimatur <br/>\nof &quot;experts&quot; which can have an impact on our school trained selves <br/>\nmore, perhaps, than unknown virtual people here online).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, DS (8) has never had limited TV or videogames - he uses them <br/>\nas a resource along with books, magazines, toys, paper and markers, <br/>\nsticks, rocks, leaves, hammer and nails, etc. He has been known to <br/>\nturn off the TV because it&#39;s interfering with something he wants to <br/>\ndo (&quot;the noise is distracting me&quot;). He&#39;s free to watch TV after <br/>\nwe&#39;ve gone to sleep - last night, he took some geomag magnets with <br/>\nhim to his room to play as I was falling asleep. I woke up an hour <br/>\nor two later and went to check to make sure he didn&#39;t wake up with <br/>\nmagnets embedded in his cheek and he had already put them away and <br/>\nwas just sitting in bed reading.
