It&#39;s that learning in ways<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s unnatural to  <br/>\n&gt; them is hard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We are hardwired to pull sense out of the world, not<br/>\n&gt; memorize someone  <br/>\n&gt; else&#39;s sense. It&#39;s how we pull an understanding of<br/>\n&gt; our native  <br/>\n&gt; language out of the chaos of words flowing around us<br/>\n&gt; as toddlers. We  <br/>\n&gt; dismiss that ability as something that just happens.<br/>\n&gt; But think of the  <br/>\n&gt; power of pulling that kind of order out of that kind<br/>\n&gt; of chaos by a  <br/>\n&gt; child that schools would turn their noses up as not<br/>\n&gt; being ready to  <br/>\n&gt; learn.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Says a lot about schools.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Says way more about the power of natural learning.<br/>\n&gt; If a child can  <br/>\n&gt; pull English out of the atmosphere, a child can pull<br/>\n&gt; sense out of the  <br/>\n&gt; world of cartoons and games and literature and<br/>\n&gt; conversations and pets  <br/>\n&gt; and grocery shopping ... If they have a desire for<br/>\n&gt; rocket science in  <br/>\n&gt; them, they&#39;ll be pulling it out of Road Runner<br/>\n&gt; cartoons and asking  <br/>\n&gt; for more :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Children pull out and build a sense of the world<br/>\n&gt; from what interests  <br/>\n&gt; them. They make guesses at how the world (including<br/>\n&gt; English) works,  <br/>\n&gt; try them out and then refine their world picture<br/>\n&gt; based on the  <br/>\n&gt; outcome.

But play *is* how kids are created to learn. It&#39;s why  <br/>\nputting a textbook in front of them is so hard for them. It&#39;s not  <br/>\nthat learning is hard. It&#39;s that learning in ways that&#39;s unnatural to  <br/>\nthem is hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are hardwired to pull sense out of the world, not memorize someone  <br/>\nelse&#39;s sense. It&#39;s how we pull an understanding of our native  <br/>\nlanguage out of the chaos of words flowing around us as toddlers. We  <br/>\ndismiss that ability as something that just happens. But think of the  <br/>\npower of pulling that kind of order out of that kind of chaos by a  <br/>\nchild that schools would turn their noses up as not being ready to  <br/>\nlearn.<br/>\n<br/>\nSays a lot about schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nSays way more about the power of natural learning. If a child can  <br/>\npull English out of the atmosphere, a child can pull sense out of the  <br/>\nworld of cartoons and games and literature and conversations and pets  <br/>\nand grocery shopping ... If they have a desire for rocket science in  <br/>\nthem, they&#39;ll be pulling it out of Road Runner cartoons and asking  <br/>\nfor more :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren pull out and build a sense of the world from what interests  <br/>\nthem. They make guesses at how the world (including English) works,  <br/>\ntry them out and then refine their world picture based on the  <br/>\noutcome. It&#39;s how they learn English. It&#39;s how they learn anything.  <br/>\nUntil adults interfere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe talk I gave at the Live and Learn Conference a few years ago  <br/>\nmight help:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy You Can&#39;t Let Go:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/joyce/talk\">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/talk</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96057767,"authorName":"Katharine Wise","from":"Katharine Wise &lt;katharinewise@...&gt;","profile":"katharinewise","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Hands on Help","postDate":"1174612942","msgId":22430,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY0MTk1Mi4zODkxNy5xbUB3ZWI2MDMyMy5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":22422,"nextInTopic":22438,"prevInTime":22429,"nextInTime":22431,"topicId":22322,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The challenge is you learning to see it, or <br/>\ntrust that its happening if you can&#39;t see it. I know I&#39;ve come <br/>\nacross a lot of references to unschoolers learning via playing with <br/>\nbarbies - if you do a search on Sandra&#39;s site you&#39;ll find all sorts <br/>\nof stuff and I believe Ren Allen is a Great source of information in <br/>\nthis area.... <br/>\n<br/>\nI know from personal experience that drawing opens up all kinds of <br/>\nworlds of learning (even if it means your house is covered in paper <br/>\nall the time...still getting over that, here!). My dd spends a lot <br/>\nof her time drawing right now, and I love that I get to see what <br/>\nshe&#39;s thinking about, what&#39;s important to her, what she&#39;s learning! <br/>\nIts amazing and inspiring.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see you have another child who likes to have things read to him, <br/>\nthat&#39;s nice. Are there particular kinds of things he likes to read <br/>\nmore than others? What are his other interests?

We would go to the library and all she would<br/>\nwant to look at is book about horses and is still like<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI struggle all the time with being taught that<br/>\nlearning had to be from a book, learning has to be<br/>\n&quot;boring&quot;, learning has to be taught.  I know that<br/>\nisn&#39;t right because I watched them learn when they<br/>\nwere small by just playing with the blocks or rolling<br/>\nthe ball but still it is hard to drop that.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway thanks for the help<br/>\n<br/>\nTwila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nDon&#39;t pick lemons.<br/>\nSee all the new 2007 cars at Yahoo!

My kids<br/>\nwere also in public school until the end of their 3rd<br/>\nand 4th grade years.  It is hard to break away from<br/>\nthe schooly things/terms.  I am still getting used to<br/>\nunschooling, and it is hard. It gets hard when you are<br/>\nused to doing things one way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about since your son is into the dungeons and<br/>\ndragons stuff, maybe you could rent some movies or<br/>\nsomething that has dragons in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe really don&#39;t do much around my house.  Alot of<br/>\ntimes, the kids play video games, or we play board<br/>\ngames, or watch movies.  They do help me when we<br/>\ngrocery shop, by adding how much we spend, so that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t forget where we are at, especially since money<br/>\nis tight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a Sandra Dodd website that has a lot of good<br/>\ninformation.  There are tons of things to do, it&#39;s<br/>\njust what you are all interested in.  Last fall, we<br/>\ndug up some hostas, because I was tired of them, and<br/>\nthey were choking out my other flowers.  We all<br/>\nlearned that we aren&#39;t planting any hostas, they are<br/>\nto hard to dig up.  We also went to the Air Zoo, which<br/>\nthe kids hated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the first things we did, and are kind<br/>\nof still doing is to deschool.  From what I&#39;ve heard,<br/>\nit&#39;s one month per year your child was in school. <br/>\nAfter that, just do what you guys are interested in. <br/>\nI have noticed that my kids are much happier, and more<br/>\nrelaxed than they were when they were in public<br/>\nschool.  Feel free to email me off list if you want to<br/>\ntalk/ bounce ideas off me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you find what you are looking for.  Most of the<br/>\npeople on this list are really helpful.  I started out<br/>\non another website, besides this one, trying to find<br/>\nout what unschooling was, and what a typical day was<br/>\nlike.  I can tell you that there aren&#39;t any typical<br/>\ndays, everyone&#39;s day looks different.  Just when you<br/>\nthink that the kids aren&#39;t learning anything, they<br/>\nsurprise you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care and good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Vanessa<br/>\n--- Twila Francis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tylightzone@...\">tylightzone@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; This list exists to help people unschool, not find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ways to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; information into their kids while candy coating<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you want to let<br/>\n&gt; &gt; go of schoolish thinking, we can give lots of<br/>\n&gt; great<br/>\n&gt; &gt; information.

I feel if we are not<br/>\nsitting with noses in books we aren&#39;t learning but I know that I also<br/>\nlearned better with hands on projects I just don&#39;t know how to<br/>\napproach it or where to go.  I need help finding sources of ideas for<br/>\nScience and Social Studies and even math or any other things that I<br/>\ncan help them to learn with, without being stuck in a book.  If you<br/>\nhave any ideas I would really appreciate the help.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as I love them, books are over-rated. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLife and learning shouldn&#39;t be divided into subjects---they&#39;re all <br/>\nconnected and interconnected. Math IS science IS social studies IS art <br/>\nis history IS music IS literature. If you can see how things are <br/>\nconnected and how they intertwine and inspire and filter through each <br/>\nother, your learning will be more organic and meaningful.<br/>\n<br/>\nScience and social studies can&#39;t be separated: bubonic plague? atomic <br/>\nbombs? penicillin? influenza of 1918? Advances in science transform our <br/>\nsociety! Lasagne? Sushi? Sauerbraten? Tortillas?  The science of food <br/>\nand eating can define societies! Math is found in ALL those things! As <br/>\nare history, music, art, literature, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nPick a subject, any subject (I don&#39;t mean *school* subjects!)---like <br/>\nfashion. Or WWII. Furniture design or gardening. Drumming or clocks. <br/>\nDelve INTO that subject/passion. You WILL hit on math and science and <br/>\nsocial studies and art and music and history and literature. GUARANTEED!<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT---to answer your question: try the SCA (Society for Creative <br/>\nAnachronism) as a place to start with hands-on learning. Most areas of <br/>\nthe country have *some* kind of living history museum or reinactments <br/>\n(around here, in SC, we have both the Civil War and Revolutionary War <br/>\nreinactors---and just last year a group set up a Roman camp). Go. Be. <br/>\nShare. Ask questions. Maybe get involved next time!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor &quot;science&quot; try the local glass-blowers (don&#39;t forget to notice all <br/>\nthe *ART* around you while on that science trip &lt;G&gt;) or blacksmith or <br/>\nbakery. &quot;Social studies&quot;---go sit at the mall or on a bench downtown. <br/>\nWatch the people. If you want, you can make a checklist: how many/how <br/>\nmany together/how many red shoes/hairstyles/cell phones/ ...WHY?<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory: Netflix all the war movies ever made. Compare all the takes on <br/>\nwar and intrigue. Look at how CLEAN war was in the early movies---like <br/>\nONE spot of blood on a sparkly uniform. THEN watch one of these recent <br/>\nmovies: BraveHeart, Saving Private Ryan, The Patriot, Gladiator---blood <br/>\nand guts and gore and veins between your teeth! Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nGet a big map of the US. Another of the world. Check off where you&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen. Where you *want* to go. Watch how that changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m giving these examples NOT for your children!!! YOU go do them! SEE <br/>\nhow much you&#39;re learning. Then accept that they will too.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is everywhere, but most people have been brainwashed into <br/>\nthinking that learning only happens with books and in a classroom. We <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have either until pretty recently in history---how did we EVER <br/>\nmove out of caves???<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.

The first step<br/>\ntowards unschooling, is to see life as the best way to learn. Life<br/>\ninvolves play and exploration and ideas and discovery, but there&#39;s no<br/>\nneed for a schoolish mindset to affect how you approach those things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo....first step; quit trying to cover subjects. Second step; start<br/>\nplaying and focusing on the things that bring you joy. Third step;<br/>\ndeclare each day a vacation....you&#39;ll be well on your way to<br/>\nunschooling at that point!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":215226992,"authorName":"tylightzone","from":"&quot;tylightzone&quot; &lt;tylightzone@...&gt;","profile":"tylightzone","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Hands on Help","postDate":"1174277663","msgId":22322,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV0bDJtditxc2Q1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22329,"prevInTime":22321,"nextInTime":22323,"topicId":22322,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am new to the group and unsure that I want to completely convert to the unschooling ways but here is what I am asking for.
