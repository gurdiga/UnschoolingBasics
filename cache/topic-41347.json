He will suddenly want beetroot and he can sit and eat and eat a heap of it just by itself - of course you can tell a day later as it shows in the toilet!

My son has a severe allergy to red food coloring. It is really horrible what happens. I tried withholding the foods (he loves skittles) but realized he would have to make the decisions. So I let him choose and we discussed what happens when he has red food coloring. He tested it out for himself and gets to choose. After a month or 2 of ups and downs he came to me and said he wanted to be able to eat skittles or m&m&#39;s but knew how it made him feel horrible, how he felt completely out of control. He will still buy skittles and M&Ms however he shares or gives the ones with red away and keeps the others.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another thing he has done for the past year or so is eat almost exclusively &quot;white&quot; food. Grits, milk, butter, cheerios, flour tortillas with cheese, cheese and crackers, mac and cheese. Sometimes he will eat PB&J sandwiches or tuna sub on wheat from Subway (the only kind he likes). I don&#39;t say anything, just let him fix what sounds best. He doesn&#39;t like tomatoes only ketchup....Do I worry about what he is eating? yes....but I have noticed lately that because I don&#39;t say things, because I trust him, he has chosen to eat more fruits and veggies. Because I give him respect and trust him to make his own food choices he doesn&#39;t feel the need to get candy that makes him feel bad--that he is allergic to. <br/>\n<br/>\n  There was a time when he was younger that all he wanted to eat was bananas, green beans and oatmeal....and everyday lunch for months was hot dogs or mac and cheese.

The other day he wanted a biscuit that had milk in it, he had it and he did pay for it.  I told him it had milk in it and he said he wished he hadnt eaten it, however he does make the choice if he comes across food that isnt dairy free.  I check all the labels of stuff and buy things that he can eat without milk, so I guess he is eating what he wants within a limit of no milk.  I get chocolate thats dairy free, & dairy free cheese so he doesnt feel like he&#39;s missing out, he loves marshmallows  and he loves potato chips, but also his fav are little rice crackers & hummus...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway would be interested in peoples take on the whole restricting food due to allergy thing, as Ive never thought about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,  Camille<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Agreed!!! And when I came to this list I had MAJOR issues with food control<br/>\n  because I had always been controlled. You can do an archive search for my<br/>\n  name and see. My story about my son and the &quot;monkey platter&quot; is even on<br/>\n  Sandra&#39;s website.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here&#39;s the thing, my boys have NOT always been unschooled. Their<br/>\n  &quot;defooding&quot; was more terrifying to me than anything else...and it&#39;s because<br/>\n  I love my kids. I know you love your kids OP, that&#39;s not in question. But<br/>\n  in the end, my mother loved me too, and being ultra controlling about food<br/>\n  ended up with me being fat anyway, and having (even now) serious body image<br/>\n  issues. Bordering on BDD. THAT is far more harmful to me than any Doritos<br/>\n  could ever be. Maybe you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to look at yourself in<br/>\n  the mirror and have actual HATE for what you see staring back at yourself.<br/>\n  But I do. I fight it every day. That&#39;s what controlling food can do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My boys are pre-teens now, so that means there isn&#39;t enough food in the free<br/>\n  world to fill them up. So they graze. Sometimes on a gallon of ice cream.<br/>\n  Most of the time it&#39;s on protein. That&#39;s what they need right now. This<br/>\n  discussion was yesterday with my soon to be 13 yr old.<br/>\n<br/>\n  John: &quot;Um....when I eat a lot of ice cream I feel like shit.&quot;<br/>\n  Me: &quot;Well, that&#39;s your body&#39;s way of telling you to knock it off.&quot;<br/>\n  John: &quot;Yeah ice cream is bad.&quot;<br/>\n  Me: &quot;Nah, ice cream isn&#39;t bad, it&#39;s great and it&#39;s enjoyable. But if you<br/>\n  eat too much it&#39;s too much fat and sugar for your body at once. Just eat it<br/>\n  in moderation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  And we had that discussion while jogging TOGETHER. My almost 13 yr old<br/>\n  wants to run with me. Doesn&#39;t feel ashamed to be with his mother and he<br/>\n  listens to me when I talk because I stopped putting my foot on his neck.<br/>\n  And I do want to encourage him to see all foods as good. ALL food has to be<br/>\n  eaten in moderation even healthy ones. Did you know about *Orthorexia*, or<br/>\n  *orthorexia nervosa* is a term coined by Steven Bratman, a Colorado MD, for<br/>\n  an eating disorder characterized by excessive focus on eating healthy foods.<br/>\n  In rare cases, this focus may turn into a fixation so extreme that it can<br/>\n  lead to severe malnutrition or even death?<br/>\n<br/>\n  How about this?

If<br/>\n  they could see how I really am, then they would hate me almost as much as I<br/>\n  do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *I believe in* oughts, musts and shoulds as unbreakable laws to determine<br/>\n  my daily behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *I believe in* perfection and strive to attain it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *I believe in* salvation through trying just a bit harder than I did<br/>\n  yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *I believe in* calorie counters as the inspired word of god, and memorize<br/>\n  them accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *I believe in* bathroom scales as an indicator of my daily successes and<br/>\n  failures.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *I believe in* hell, because I sometimes think that I&#39;m living in it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *I believe in* a wholly black and white world, the losing of weight,<br/>\n  recrimination for sins, the abnegation of the body and a life ever fasting.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *Amen*<br/>\n<br/>\n  *<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.beyondveg.com/inanna/eating-disorders/anorexic-creed-1a.shtml\">http://www.beyondveg.com/inanna/eating-disorders/anorexic-creed-1a.shtml</a><br/>\n  *<br/>\n<br/>\n  **************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n  *So there is more at stake here than just gmos. Let my kids eat<br/>\n  oreos...their bodies will tell them when to stop. It&#39;s none of my<br/>\n  business. I&#39;m here to help them get the info they want and need when they<br/>\n  ask.<br/>\n  *<br/>\n<br/>\n  *One final thing, when you rule by fear, you create a child who is<br/>\n  anxious and fearful. And that&#39;s not a joyful way to live. And it&#39;s a hell<br/>\n  of a lot harder to undo that than it is to stop eating Doritos. And that&#39;s<br/>\n  from PERSONAL experience not studies.*<br/>\n<br/>\n  *Karen<br/>\n  *<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41391,"nextTopicId":41384}}
