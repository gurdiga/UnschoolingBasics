We did start with the whole school at home idea. Did it for a <br/>\ncouple of years, right down to a time schedule. Yuck !!!  We went to <br/>\neclectic learning, did math & spelling by the book but all the rest the kids <br/>\npicked.  After reading here, a few other groups (which we learned there was <br/>\nsome better than others), and many web sites it dawned on me unschooling is <br/>\nwhat we were looking for & needed so badly.  I came to realize the tears <br/>\n(mine & theirs) were NOT necessary. That there was a better way. Do we wish <br/>\nwe had followed the unschooling way of life in the beginning?  You bet, we <br/>\nwere slow getting here but we did it.<br/>\nIt took me a while to start to &quot;get it&quot;,  lots of day of wondering if this <br/>\nwas the right thing to do.  We did it slowly, I started by saying yes alot <br/>\nmore ( and if it was no, we made very sure of the reason, explaining it to <br/>\nthe kids & letting the kids have their say). I went thru our school stuff & <br/>\nmade a pile of &quot;school&quot; stuff. Kept all the books that weren&#39;t text books & <br/>\nare putting the rest on ebay.  Well, we did keep the Math U See because my <br/>\ndd loves to play with the pages & blocks but when she&#39;s ready to let go of <br/>\nit its gone also.  That was one step on our journey but it won&#39;t be the last <br/>\n:)<br/>\nFrom one newbie to another .... welcome & hang in there.<br/>\nCarol (a fellow yankee in Maine)<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Keri&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kericahill@...\">kericahill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, November 20, 2005 7:39 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] New here, saying hi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi guys, I&#39;m not sure, but I THINK I have yet to post an intro here.<br/>\n&gt; I joined so many unschooling groups at once (bad idea), I&#39;m losing<br/>\n&gt; track! My name is Keri, I&#39;m 40 on the outside & maybe 10 on the<br/>\n&gt; inside, live near the ocean north of Boston, and recently adopted my<br/>\n&gt; daughter Anastasia, age 12-13, from Siberia. So, yes, I was in<br/>\n&gt; Siberia in the dead of winter this year, but that&#39;s a story for<br/>\n&gt; another yahoo group...<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I am working my way towards unschooling. Nast ( what she went<br/>\n&gt; by in Russia) attends the local charter school about 3 days a week,<br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;m tRYING to make it possible to have her home every day. Right<br/>\n&gt; now I&#39;m trying to figure out how to do that while still working. She<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t be home alone just yet (RAD, PTSD and other stuff) but I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; hoping she can by next summer. So I&#39;m really looking at just trying<br/>\n&gt; to survive the next maybe 6 months of part-time schooling. I HATE it,<br/>\n&gt; but know no other way this minute. I want to make her unschooling<br/>\n&gt; time, 4 days a week right now, really worthwhile. Right now she would<br/>\n&gt; choose to watch tv all day. Is this just an aspect of deschooling?<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s very hard for me not to ask her to turn it off..I used to be<br/>\n&gt; VERY anti-tv, but am trying to change my ways! Any even general<br/>\n&gt; advice to someone very new to unschooling? What do you wish you had<br/>\n&gt; known/done in the beginning? Are there parents on this board who,<br/>\n&gt; like me, transitioned from schooling to unschooling or did everyone<br/>\n&gt; start when their kids were young? I should mention that the concept<br/>\n&gt; of unschooling has really got my daughter scratching her head..lol!<br/>\n&gt; In Russia it was mandatory school 6 days per week and corporal<br/>\n&gt; punishment was the norm. Right now she is still shocked that her<br/>\n&gt; teachers here don&#39;t beat her....REALLY. The first day there she asked<br/>\n&gt; me why the teacher smiled at her!
