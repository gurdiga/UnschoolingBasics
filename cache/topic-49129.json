He also graciously accepted that his big sister would be homeschooling too, and he would lose a lot of alone time with Mom, and need to compromise a lot. That&#39;s a biggie.

She notices when he might be getting hungry, helps him figure out what he might want, makes it for him and gently (more gently than I could) reminds him to eat it. I don&#39;t have to pester him to eat his [breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack] any more, or deal with the cranky kid if I don&#39;t get him to eat on time. She&#39;s on top of it.

I can&#39;t tell you the peace I have felt just by letting go. &quot;This<br/>\ntoo shall pass,&quot; as the saying goes. I think they will care about a clean<br/>\nhome because they grow up in one and eventually they will adopt the values.<br/>\nThat&#39;s how it happened for me, even though cleaning felt like an impossible<br/>\nchore when I was a kid.

So you&#39;re not going to &quot;get it right&quot; all the time right from the start. You&#39;re going to fall back on what&#39;s familiar sometimes, and learn from that experience. The catch is to decide what you&#39;re going to learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat might sound odd, but right now, you&#39;re teetering on the edge of learning that you can&#39;t do it, that you&#39;re failing. You can use the same experiences remind you of why you don&#39;t want to be that person - the grumpy, irritable mom who&#39;s always at odds with her kids. Use those icky feelings as information - a reason to make different choices next time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;how do I stop being grumpy about cleaning, our picking up after them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To some extent, that depends on your personality.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help to dig down into the reasons why you&#39;re grumpy in the first place, analyze them and pull them apart so that when you notice yourself falling into a grump you can talk yourself out of it. If you&#39;re having trouble with that, lay the reasons out here, and others can offer up ideas that they&#39;ve found helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on your personality maybe rather than talk yourself out of it spend some time being okay with being grumpy . Sometimes I know I&#39;m going to clean and be grumpy about it, and I&#39;m okay with that. I&#39;m going to wallow a little in feeling under-appreciated, rail against the patriarchy for a while, and then I&#39;ll finish cleaning and get over that. Maybe it&#39;s the &quot;getting over that&quot; you&#39;re struggling with - in which case I don&#39;t recommend wallowing!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re feeling unappreciated, then it&#39;s all the more important to dig down into Why. Do you think that others are Supposed to appreciate your hard work? Whether they actually value it or not? Do you expect other people to &quot;pitch in&quot; and are resenting when they don&#39;t? Do you equate caretaking with love and feel unloved because no-one is taking care of you? Are you resenting the fact that even though it&#39;s &quot;your turn&quot; to be the boss, you&#39;ve given that up? None of those thoughts make you a bad person - they&#39;re all pretty natural if you&#39;ve been raised to expect moms to require housework from kids. But it can take some time and effort to start to move past all of that, to go from resenting the fact that you&#39;ve missed your turn to celebrating it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I&#39;ll focus on the fact that - hey! I have a house to clean! This summer, when it got so very, very dry and there were wildfires in other parts of the country I was thinking about the fact that I might not have a house - and what then? So having a house to clean is a good thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the winter, I like to wash dishes when I&#39;m chilled - we don&#39;t have a dishwasher, so washing dishes is old fashioned hands in the sink work, here. When my hands are cold, that&#39;s bliss. This summer, I tried a different tactic. I got a new dish soap with a smell I really like and put an audio book on when I wanted to wash. I got a lot more dishes done! It&#39;s harder to do audio books for general tidying-up, but they&#39;re good for cleaning one small area, like the bathroom, or for organizing shelves (or plastic lids... what is it with plastic containers and lids that don&#39;t match?). <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, and here&#39;s an odd thing... sometimes it helps to wear a dust mask.  <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":474971233,"authorName":"sarajoturtle","from":"&quot;sarajoturtle&quot; &lt;sarajoturtle@...&gt;","profile":"sarajoturtle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Changing attitude","postDate":"1349374765","msgId":49129,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGs0a2p2ZCs0bm12QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49130,"prevInTime":49128,"nextInTime":49130,"topicId":49129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am starting to understand that most of the things that I m getting irritated with and things I want to fix, just have to do with me changing my attitude","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1197211819\">I am starting to understand that most of the things that I&#39;m getting irritated with and things I want to fix, just have to do with me changing my attitude about it.
