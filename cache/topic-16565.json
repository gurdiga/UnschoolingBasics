He said that what he has read is that if a child falls behind now that he will be behind forever.  I found his statement to be so startling that I just moved on.  So when I read Ren&#39;s reply today it really struck me.  Is there a difference between a child who starts reading earlier and one who does not?  One of my cousins could not read until she was 16 and she was in school.  She had lots of issues that prevented her from being able to focus on what was going on in school but she has gone on to college and received different medical certifications.  I don&#39;t read her writing often but I have to believe what I always read here, people get it when they get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hubby is not an unschooler.  I don&#39;t talk about the radical unschooling lifestyle much with him, I just live it and accommodate him on the points that he gets most intense about.  So I do just a little work on letters with my near 6 yr old to accommodate his wishes for &quot;educational&quot; activities to occur.  I have no desire to push my son before he is ready to read.  I trust in this process.  I guess I am trying to figure out how I can provide info to my husband that will help him to understand that there are so many paths to learning that land us all in a place where we are actually functional people who can  achieve whatever it is that we desire to achieve.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hubby and I are corporate america meets tree hugger.
