They were very helpful!  Here&#39;s an<br/>\nupdate on how the meeting went:<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for our meeting last night, it was a very heated discussion (which<br/>\nis rare for us - lol).  There were two main complaints against video<br/>\ngames: 1) they are bad for children and 2) they reduce socialization,<br/>\nwhich is why the group gets together.  Two parents (out of about 12)<br/>\nwere strongly against video games and felt that they should be banned.<br/>\n Four parents, including myself, felt that video games have a bad<br/>\nreputation which is not completely valid.  I brought up the point,<br/>\nthat I have seen on the boards several times, asking if we would be<br/>\nupset if a child came and read a book the whole time at our get<br/>\ntogether (which has been known to happen).  Several others felt that<br/>\nalthough they didn&#39;t &quot;like&quot; video games, that by banning them or<br/>\nmaking any rules about them that they were passing judgement and that<br/>\nit was up to each parent to decide what was best for their children. <br/>\nFortunately, majority ruled and the decision was made to not ban them<br/>\nbased on the principle of it being a parent&#39;s personal choice. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;ve said before, I would love to find a local group with the<br/>\nparenting beliefs of you and so many others on this board, so I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to deal with these issues (and sometimes my own guilt and<br/>\nrevisiting these old tapes in my head).  But overall, for now, we<br/>\nstill have a wonderful time with this group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarla   Mom to Amy (8 yo.) and Lily (3.5 yo.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Marla B.&quot; &lt;marla@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our homeschool group (which is not unschooling) wants to ban/limit<br/>\n&gt; handheld video games.
