Good to know all your relations are doing ok right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI finally heard from Sonja (the unschooling Mom that lost <br/>\nEVERYTHING) and they&#39;ve been getting donations of food and clothing <br/>\nand such from churches down there. I asked her to call so I could <br/>\nget some of the stuff everyone here sent our way. <br/>\n<br/>\nUpdate on Jay and Betsy: <br/>\nKatie got extremely sick with Salmonella this week and was <br/>\nhospitalized (does it ever end?). She was released yesterday and is <br/>\ndoing MUCH better...it was the dehydration actually that got really <br/>\nscary and was the reason for keeping her there. Once they got her <br/>\nhydrated, she perked up fairly quick. <br/>\nI&#39;ve given them some of the donations you all sent...they were <br/>\ntotally floored. They asked for me to give them addresses so they <br/>\ncould thank everyone, but I told them folks had asked me to just <br/>\nkeep them updated rather than have them write a personal thanks <br/>\n(figuring they had enough to worry about right now). <br/>\nThey&#39;ve been so touched by everyone&#39;s concern. Interestingly, I had <br/>\nsome cash (from all the donations) ready for them and had planned to <br/>\ntake it over the next day. <br/>\nJay had shown up at our door at about 10pm on Thursday night, <br/>\nlooking very ashen and shaky. He told us about Katie and how worried <br/>\nthey were (we knew she was sick, but not in the hospital), so the <br/>\nhelp came at the perfect moment really...they desperately needed a <br/>\nboost that night. <br/>\nHe was almost in tears. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey are more grateful for all the concern and want you all to know <br/>\nhow much it means to them. Things will get better and they&#39;ll never <br/>\nforget all the kindness they&#39;ve encountered from unschoolers they <br/>\nhad never even met!! <br/>\n<br/>\nKatie is coming over soon to take home a big bagful of all the art <br/>\nsupplies/clothing items that have also been sent. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you again everyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nLove, <br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3375,"nextTopicId":3369}}
