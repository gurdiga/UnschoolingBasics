Andy was heartbroken, and wanted to know what Uncle and Aunty believe happens when they die, so I researched their beliefs.  They are Shin Buddhists (the most common branch in Japan) and we talked about the 49-day celebration they&#39;d have for Uncle.  Andy really enjoyed thinking that someday Uncle will be back around, and thinks anyone who gets Uncle for a child will be very blessed and happy.  (Andy has always accepted reincarnation as absolute fact.) We all miss Uncle Nobu very much -- he is truly one of the most truly generous people I&#39;ve ever known.  He and his wife, Michie, have always loved and seen Andy for exactly who he is -- a rare thing in so many people. From stories I&#39;ve heard, they were very much the kind of parents we try to be, supporting their kids&#39; freedom and wonder. Their kids were known as &#39;the wild ones&#39; and have grown to be<br/>\n wonderful (and successful) adults, so we can point to their methods to defend our own. <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":326249694,"authorName":"Kimberly Slage","from":"&quot;Kimberly Slage&quot; &lt;kimberlyslage@...&gt;","profile":"magnolia_academy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New to the group and commment on Baby Borrowers","postDate":"1215832722","msgId":34497,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIyMjVmOWVhMDgwNzExMjAxOHI2ODY0NjA5ZXNmOWQ2MTI1NWRhM2VlOTQ0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc1ODVoZithOTM0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDMxNTY1NS4xMjQ5Ny5xbUB3ZWI1MDQxMi5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+CSA8ZzU4NWhmK2E5MzRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34496,"nextInTopic":34498,"prevInTime":34496,"nextInTime":34498,"topicId":34426,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello Shalyn, I am so glad that you and your husband have chosen to unschool.

I wonder how<br/>\n&gt; this might be extended, or not, to other kinds of cultural associations,<br/>\n&gt; such as signing and Deaf culture.  Hearing parents may have a deaf<br/>\n&gt; child�we&#39;ve got a few here on this list, I believe�so how does this apply?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I wonder if what you&#39;re saying is that parents should make the heritage<br/>\n&gt; stuff part of the family . . . even if, at that time they decide to take it<br/>\n&gt; up, the adopted child DOESN&#39;T want a doll of the same color skin?  The<br/>\n&gt; child&#39;s not wanting that doll may have been a product of the parents&#39;<br/>\n&gt; neglecting the heriage aspect�no books, etc. reflecting the heriage.  So if<br/>\n&gt; the child is deaf, does that mean the parents should go into the heritage<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; the Deaf community, get books, videos, etc. from the Deaf world?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While my three hearing boys are naturally immersed in signing and in both<br/>\n&gt; Deaf and DeafBlind cultures, the cultures of their parents, my wife and I<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; have hearing stuff for them, such as music-related stuff and also they have<br/>\n&gt; tons of hearing friends of all ages.  So I know what it&#39;s all about what<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; said about their being totally immersed in the family but the fact of their<br/>\n&gt; being hearing is also honored.  I did find it very difficult to accept<br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; being hearing and the idea of having hearing stuff in my home�but it was<br/>\n&gt; important that I did accept this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, this is very rarely done in reverse.  Hearing parents rarely<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; learn signing and many seem to want nothing to do with the signing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; community.  So it is almost always up to the deaf child to arrive at who<br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt; is, somehow, and to fight for identity.  I may be wrong, but I think<br/>\n&gt; adopted<br/>\n&gt; children often do have identity crises, trying to figure out who they are,<br/>\n&gt; and it&#39;s sad if they have to fight against their parents to do this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I have to say that I agree with the honoring part; it gives more options<br/>\n&gt; to the child for self-identification and expression.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; John<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\n&gt; Checked by AVG.<br/>\n&gt; Version: 7.5.526 / Virus Database: 270.4.7/1542 - Release Date: 7/9/2008<br/>\n&gt; 6:50 AM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\n&gt; Checked by AVG.<br/>\n&gt; Version: 7.5.526 / Virus Database: 270.4.7/1542 - Release Date: 7/9/2008<br/>\n&gt; 6:50 AM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I wonder how<br/>\nthis might be extended, or not, to other kinds of cultural associations,<br/>\nsuch as signing and Deaf culture.  Hearing parents may have a deaf<br/>\nchild�we&#39;ve got a few here on this list, I believe�so how does this apply?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I wonder if what you&#39;re saying is that parents should make the heritage<br/>\nstuff part of the family . . . even if, at that time they decide to take it<br/>\nup, the adopted child DOESN&#39;T want a doll of the same color skin?  The<br/>\nchild&#39;s not wanting that doll may have been a product of the parents&#39;<br/>\nneglecting the heriage aspect�no books, etc. reflecting the heriage.  So if<br/>\nthe child is deaf, does that mean the parents should go into the heritage of<br/>\nthe Deaf community, get books, videos, etc. from the Deaf world?  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile my three hearing boys are naturally immersed in signing and in both<br/>\nDeaf and DeafBlind cultures, the cultures of their parents, my wife and I do<br/>\nhave hearing stuff for them, such as music-related stuff and also they have<br/>\ntons of hearing friends of all ages.  So I know what it&#39;s all about what you<br/>\nsaid about their being totally immersed in the family but the fact of their<br/>\nbeing hearing is also honored.  I did find it very difficult to accept their<br/>\nbeing hearing and the idea of having hearing stuff in my home�but it was<br/>\nimportant that I did accept this.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, this is very rarely done in reverse.  Hearing parents rarely<br/>\nlearn signing and many seem to want nothing to do with the signing<br/>\ncommunity.  So it is almost always up to the deaf child to arrive at who she<br/>\nis, somehow, and to fight for identity.  I may be wrong, but I think adopted<br/>\nchildren often do have identity crises, trying to figure out who they are,<br/>\nand it&#39;s sad if they have to fight against their parents to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I have to say that I agree with the honoring part; it gives more options<br/>\nto the child for self-identification and expression.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJohn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG.<br/>\nVersion: 7.5.526 / Virus Database: 270.4.7/1542 - Release Date: 7/9/2008<br/>\n6:50 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG. <br/>\nVersion: 7.5.526 / Virus Database: 270.4.7/1542 - Release Date: 7/9/2008<br/>\n6:50 AM<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":133390932,"authorName":"Mara","from":"Mara &lt;mamadeluz@...&gt;","profile":"mamadeluz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Skin color and self-esteem","postDate":"1215655002","msgId":34455,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczODk4OC45NDg2NC5xbUB3ZWI1MzIwOS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34450,"nextInTopic":34461,"prevInTime":34454,"nextInTime":34456,"topicId":34426,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That reminds me about a little girl I used to babysit for who had a lot of dolls.

She doesn&#39;t like old Asians.  Young people are OK but over 50<br/>\n&gt; or younger than 50 but looking old makes her very uncomfortable.  (She&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; almost 4, developmentally 2.5-3, and home 6 months.)  Anyway, I wanted to<br/>\n&gt; echo what Ren said, the doll is immaterial...are you honoring her culture?<br/>\n&gt; Do you celebrate african holidays?  Cook african foods?  Listen to music<br/>\n&gt; that reflect where she came from?  (And I&#39;m assume AA and not Haitian which<br/>\n&gt; would be different but still needs to be a part of your home.)  My daughter<br/>\n&gt; is Chinese, but she&#39;s also Jewish.  And she&#39;s (by extention) Celtic as<br/>\n&gt; well.  And by bringing her into our home, we became a Chinese family.  (It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; a never ending cycle of hoildays around here!)  I guess my point is that is<br/>\n&gt; is not enough to &quot;just love her&quot; because that does not honor who she is and<br/>\n&gt; where she came from and that is just not something that most people<br/>\n&gt; understand.  You have to have been involved with interracial/international<br/>\n&gt; adoption to really understand how different it is.  So let her have whatever<br/>\n&gt; dolls she wants, they are only toys.  But start listening to Ladysmith Black<br/>\n&gt; Mambazo and cooking low country foods etc....that will do more for her sense<br/>\n&gt; of self than any toy.  And you do need to prepare her because although YOU<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t see her as &quot;your black daughter&quot; the world is going to see her as a<br/>\n&gt; black woman.  And she needs to understand what that means.  Bringing her<br/>\n&gt; ethnic heritage into your family fully and embracing it as yours means she<br/>\n&gt; will see who she is and where she came from (dna) as valuable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hth,<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Skin color and self-esteem","postDate":"1215626380","msgId":34446,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk4MzY1OS40MTg1LnFtQHdlYjUzODA5Lm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":34443,"nextInTopic":34448,"prevInTime":34445,"nextInTime":34447,"topicId":34426,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That s my point, she doesn t *want* dolls with skin like hers, and it just makes me wonder if her self-esteem is suffering in some way because all she wants","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1042562872\">That&#39;s my point, she doesn&#39;t *want* dolls with skin like hers, and it just makes me wonder if her self-esteem is suffering in some way because all she wants are light-skinned dolls.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nWhen I was a little girl, all dolls were white (and most were blond, too).  I&#39;m caucasian, with hazel eyes and brown hair.  I quickly realized there were no dolls that looked like me.  In those days, all Barbies were blonde, tho her younger cousin Skipper had brown hair (and no boobs).  No one wanted to be Skipper. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n <br/>\nInstead of dolls of a different color, I focused on friends of different colors.  At that time, the prettiest little girl I knew was of AA/Cherokee descent.  Chantal was gorgeous, with flowing shiny black hair, creamy tan skin, big doe-brown eyes.  I could have stared at her all day (probably did).  No one had ever told me that I wasn&#39;t pretty, or defined for me what was pretty.  I found her pretty because I like tan skin/dark hair.  She was exotic and beautiful. That continued -- thru high school, I had Asian, Hispanic and African-American friends (I had caucasian friends, too.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt must have been obvious to my Mom that I liked &#39;different&#39; because by the time I was 10, I was hearing about why it was a bad idea to date non-whites, because if I married a non-white man, my kids would be &#39;mixed&#39; and never fit anywhere.  That didn&#39;t bother me -- heck, I was white in a white family and I didn&#39;t fit, not in my family or my community at-large (very conservative small-town Oklahoma).  <br/>\n <br/>\nI dated a variety of men -- my first husband was half-mexican; my current husband is 3rd generation Japanese-American (technically Okinawan).  I was amazed that, for the entire time dh and I dated (86 - 94), I regularly had people asking me &#39;race&#39; questions. Sure, Gary&#39;s obviously not caucasian (he jokes that he looks Japanese like he looks Mexican), but come on, does it really matter anymore?  Or maybe I&#39;m just the naive white girl.  Whether or not I gave a gracious answer depended on who asked the stupid question. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy point in all this is, I don&#39;t think it needs to be made a big deal.  Buy her the dolls she wants.  Whatever it says about her is likely inherent.  The fact that you&#39;re aware of the potential, says to me that you&#39;re doing all you can to value her for who she is.  As she grows and explores the way she wants to look in the world, who she wants to be, help her to find the methods of expression that bring her joy.  She doesn&#39;t need to be whatever society expects of her as an AA girl, or as the child of a white family.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know that a little AA girl who wants a blond, blue-eyed doll is any different from a white adolescent who wants a pierced lip and green mohawk.  Today, almost anyone can have any appearance they want.  I&#39;d be inclined to put less importance on her choice of doll and more energy towards loving her exactly as she is. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;d like to think that someday it really won&#39;t matter.  At least I hope so for the sake of my 23yo, blue-eyed, half-Mexican son with a Japanese surname!
