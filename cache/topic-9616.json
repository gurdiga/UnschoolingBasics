We are thinking that we will do  grandma&#39;s <br/>\nhouse during the day.  In NY where we are, the laws are kind of  strict, but <br/>\nno, there&#39;s nothing about time that you need to be home to  &quot;homeschool&quot;. You <br/>\njust have to do a minimum number of days and turn in tons of  paperwork at <br/>\ncertain times (each quarter) of the schoolyear, but all that can be  handled.  I <br/>\nthink I have enough &quot;school-speak&quot; (you know that language  educators use to <br/>\nsound important) to make our paperwork sound just fine, even  without formal <br/>\n&quot;school times&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am starting to wonder however what my own job (superindentant and  <br/>\nprincipal) will think when they find out (it&#39;s a small area even though I don&#39;t  work <br/>\nin the district we live in).  I don&#39;t have tenure in my district since  we <br/>\njust moved and it&#39;ll be interesting to see if this gets in the way of that  <br/>\nhappening for me.  Oh well, that was just a side thought.  I know  there are lots <br/>\nof other p.s. teachers out there who homeschool, probably being  teachers in ps <br/>\ndrives them to homeschool more like.<br/>\n <br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9609,"nextTopicId":9562}}
