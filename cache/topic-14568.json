When I took her out of <br/>\nschool, she wouldn&#39;t read anything other than Dr. Seuss, Berenstain <br/>\nBears and Amelia Bedelia because she was not allowed to read those <br/>\nin school.  (Her AR level at school was 4th-6th grades.)  I told her <br/>\nthat when people are forced to read even by receiving incentives, it <br/>\ntakes the joy away.

I&#39;d be honest though and tell her that the <br/>\nReading program at libraries is to keep children reading during the <br/>\nsummer because they are out of school.  They were forced to read <br/>\nthings during the school year so the only way to get kids to read <br/>\nfor &#39;fun&#39; is to offer them incentives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not know that libraries received funding for number of <br/>\nparticipants.
