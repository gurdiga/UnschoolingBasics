This is all very new  to <br/>\nus, and although my mind is fully there, putting it all in practice  <br/>\nhas a way to go!   Rest assured, this is not the last time we will  <br/>\nbe together, and we always have here, or email, to communicate!  We  <br/>\nshould definitely try to get our kids together sometime (I&#39;ll keep <br/>\nyou  posted if we come up your way camping - we WILL be at Danforth <br/>\nBay near  Ossipee in a couple of weeks!)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nJann,<br/>\nThank you. <br/>\nI wanted to say in my last post that Dustin used to be shy also until we  hit <br/>\nthe 2004 convention. I know we discussed it but on the drive home  Sunday <br/>\nDustin and I talked more about it. He said that it helped him in 04 to  remember <br/>\nour talk about being in a new place and being anything/anyone you want  to be. <br/>\nHis goal in 2004 was to meet as many as possible. This year it was to get  <br/>\ninto that teen room. <br/>\nHe met another girl who was wanting to meet the teens (this was her first  <br/>\nyear). With a lil (a few supportive words) prompting they bit the  bullet and <br/>\nwalked into the room. My heart sunk. There is no way as a teen I  would have <br/>\nbeen able to do that. My eyes welled with tears I could quickly  blink away when <br/>\nI saw my son brave the unknown. I hoped he would have a great  experience and <br/>\nhe did. My son the former introvert seeking friendship also  joined the <br/>\nhugging session. He wore a pink ribbon on his name tag too (took  me a second to <br/>\nfigure that out but I got it).<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m rambling but I wanted to say that next time your  daughter is <br/>\nwelcome to connect with us and Dustin said he will walk her in  and stay with <br/>\nher. I will remember she&#39;s there..I have no clue how I missed  that she wasn&#39;t <br/>\nout and about and for that i&#39;m sorry.  Dustin  said he wished he knew and to put <br/>\nhis name on that meet list next time and he&#39;ll  hook her up with some new <br/>\npeps:)<br/>\n <br/>\nI still need to DL the photo&#39;s but I&#39;ll get them out.<br/>\nI keep smiling and thinking of the dude from Maine who sang the song  and <br/>\nforgot the words and sang something like Laa laa laa I forgot the words...  but <br/>\nit&#39;s ok... bc this is an unschooling conference ..and you all wont  judge me <br/>\nfor forgetting. The applause he got brought more tears as I tried to  snap a <br/>\nphoto. I got it though!<br/>\n <br/>\nLaura <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13803,"nextTopicId":13771}}
