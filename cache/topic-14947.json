Boxers can be  replaced, your child&#39;s <br/>\nemotions cannot. <br/>\n I doubt it&#39;s on purpose or to cause you to  wash. I don&#39;t think you intended <br/>\nto focus on that but you did.. <br/>\n <br/>\n*How is the child? How does he feel when this happens  and mostly what is <br/>\nyour reaction to it?  How old are we talking? <br/>\n <br/>\nChildren react to their parents emotions they hear the  sighs(not saying you <br/>\ndo).. <br/>\nWatch him (without him knowing).. Is he hiding behind a  chair, corner or a <br/>\nroom. Again age is a huge factor. If we are talking about a 3  or a 4 yr old I <br/>\ncertainly would give it more time.<br/>\nKnow when he goes bc if he is holding  it&#39;s dangerous(you should be able to <br/>\ntell from the stool he is passing). If  you giving him softeners that will <br/>\ntrigger accidents also.<br/>\n <br/>\n My thoughts are.. IF his movements are  uncomfortable and he&#39;s holding then <br/>\ngets in a situation where he can&#39;t and then  it happens something to loosen <br/>\nthose stools are needed along with a diet look..  Med&#39;s that bring on movements <br/>\nare torture to a child with this  issue.  Fiber in his food may be needed. <br/>\nPrivacy to go? Again age is a  factor..<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not suggesting you skip the medical eval though I  would look at age and <br/>\ntriggers first. <br/>\n <br/>\nLaura<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":174410770,"authorName":"D Smith","from":"D Smith &lt;sandshuse@...&gt;","profile":"sandshuse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Diet and bowels","postDate":"1151358775","msgId":14949,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNjI2MjE1MjU2Ljg3MjY4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyOTE0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA2MjYxMjU4dDZiMWVhOTk1cjdlMTVkMTExNjdjZjYxMzFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":14947,"nextInTopic":14983,"prevInTime":14948,"nextInTime":14950,"topicId":14947,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It gets truly frustrating as a parent to have to be washing poopy undies all the time and having them wear out faster because you have to bleach them and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-435115588\">&quot;It gets truly frustrating as a parent to have to be<br/>\nwashing poopy undies all the time and having them wear<br/>\nout faster because you have to bleach them and having<br/>\nan upset little boy because his favorite pair of navy<br/>\nboxers with dog bones now are hot pink after so many<br/>\nwashings and bleachings. :(&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of bleach, I would suggest Soil Love.

Constipation and the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1579457105\">Lovely subject line, eh?  Something kept pinging in my brain that I<br/>\nhad heard an article recently about children with bowel problems.<br/>\nConstipation and the connection to neurology rather than diet.  I<br/>\nfinally found it.  The doctor interviewed is in Portland, OR.  It&#39;s a<br/>\ngood read and something to ask your doctor about.  From what it sounds<br/>\nthis is a simple procedure which has almost immediate results.  Maybe<br/>\nit is something that could help your son.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I remembered this is because all three of my children have<br/>\nsuffered from bowel problems.  I thought I had screwed up somewhere as<br/>\na parent because I could urine train them but not bm train them.<br/>\nEmily and Mary Elayne both have grown out of this condition, but Keon<br/>\ncontinues to have problems with this.  He has only recently been able<br/>\nto express to us that he truly doesn&#39;t feel himself eliminating<br/>\nsometimes.  We are actually looking into this procedure for Keon to<br/>\nsee if it would help.  It gets truly frustrating as a parent to have<br/>\nto be washing poopy undies all the time and having them wear out<br/>\nfaster because you have to bleach them and having an upset little boy<br/>\nbecause his favorite pair of navy boxers with dog bones now are hot<br/>\npink after so many washings and bleachings.  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did medication:  limited help.  We did diet changes:  no help<br/>\nexcept those that were extremely laxative in nature and then it had<br/>\nthe reverse effect.  We did punishments: HA!  We did rewards:  Double<br/>\nHA!  We did ever present parenting:  nada.  I remember hearing this<br/>\narticle several months ago in a haze of sleep and suddenly waking up<br/>\nand going, &quot;Wait, they could be talking about my kids!&quot;  It wasn&#39;t<br/>\nuntil recently that I remembered I was going to do research on it and<br/>\nmade a note of it.
