But plenty of people get into unschooling without knowing more than &quot;no curriculum&quot; and &quot;kids will learn what they need to know.&quot; I&#39;m guessing you need to spend some time learning about unschooling on the one hand, and spend more time engaged with what your children are doing on the other. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t know where to go or who to turn to and I just feel like I should crawl in a ball some place and cry.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nYou sound really overwhelmed!

If they&#39;re struggling at anything, they aren&#39;t ready for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey aren&#39;t ready to memorize bits of abstract knowledge. That&#39;s what *passes* for reading and math in school. But, in actual practice, doing school math or reading doesn&#39;t mean they can do either when they encounter them in real life. Being able to add numbers on a worksheet doesn&#39;t mean someone understands addition or can add up how much money they have to figure out if they can afford a toy. Being able to read controlled readers doesn&#39;t mean a child can read a note left for them. School pretends they&#39;re the same. They aren&#39;t.

You have unreasonable expectations of what unschooling looks like and what your unique kids should be able to do. That&#39;s bound to cause knots in stomachs.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids *do* learn math and reading but it doesn&#39;t look like school math or reading and it doesn&#39;t come on the school schedule. They learn, real functional math and reading by doing both in real life a little at a time, for their own purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>\nDown the left side are several pages on reading and math.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and the problem now is I am worried about them when it comes to being &quot;tested&quot;<br/>\n&gt; by their peers, family that is not on board with homeschooling in general let alone<br/>\n&gt; unschooling, and the potential of being &quot;turned in&quot; for lack of educating them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What state do you live in?

Do things they enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How can a child learn math or reading or writing without schooling,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They do. Because it&#39;s natural to pull meaning from chaos. It&#39;s what our human brains are designed to do. Our brains don&#39;t memorize nearly as well which is why schools need to spend a huge amount of time getting facts into kids&#39; heads.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut natural learning doesn&#39;t look like school learning. It isn&#39;t linear. It jumps all over the place, like building a jigsaw puzzle.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school it&#39;s like they start at the top left of the jigsaw puzzle and work over and down, putting pieces where the teacher tells them. If the goal is to complete, say, the top center figure, by 2nd grade, the teachers press them to do so. You can expect &quot;progress&quot; will look a certain way and the kids will go through the motions. Not liking it. Not really understanding what they&#39;re doing or why. They&#39;re just doing what they&#39;re told.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unschooling, they fill in the jigsaw puzzle where interest takes them. If you focus on them completing the top center figure as they would in school, you&#39;ll miss what they&#39;re doing *instead*.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo by focusing on math and reading, you&#39;re missing what they&#39;re pulling in instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162651771,"authorName":"Lora P","from":"&quot;Lora P&quot; &lt;lcmpek@...&gt;","profile":"lcmpek","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Struggling and scared","postDate":"1330969115","msgId":47992,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpqMnRtcitsaGwwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47993,"prevInTime":47991,"nextInTime":47993,"topicId":47992,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am so upset right now.
