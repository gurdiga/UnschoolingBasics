Then I got quiet and listened to what was going on behind me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA young girl (4 or 5 yrs) had spilled her coke, and her dad was berating her, how many times have I told you..., why can&#39;t you...   Valerie and I just sat there ( I felt paralyzed) for a few nanoseconds. Then I said, &quot;you think we ought to spill a few cokes over here?&quot;  I am usually not a quick thinker in those situations, the unschooling gods shone down on me for a moment.  After a couple more reeeeeaaaalllly long nanoseconds, Valerie knocked over her coke.  The waitress cleaning up the girl&#39;s spill said, &quot;Oh that&#39;s OK, I&#39;ve got the mop right here.&quot;  It took the heat off the little girl for awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe grandma sitting at that table was embarrassed by her son&#39;s (the dad) actions.  She asked him several times to &quot;please stop&quot; his mean comments and behavior.  He continued to be rude at different times throughout the meal.  For whatever reason, sick or sick of her treatment, the little girl threw up on her plate.  I think there was a bit more compassion for her for awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie, I hope you&#39;ll elaborate, if I missed anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nJill<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Krisula Moyer <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, September 09, 2004 9:31 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] RE: Valerie Speeches WAS Karen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mercedes wrote:  (about Varie&#39;s speech at the conference)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;I loved the story about the spilled water in the restaurant.
