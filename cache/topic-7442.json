Here&#39;s the conference version we did;<br/>\n<br/>\n1) List all of the ways you&#39;ve made money in your entire life (include<br/>\nyour younger years, small/side jobs, career paths etc...)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) List all of the interests and hobbies you have pursued in the past<br/>\nor pursue today. ALL of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) List all of the things you&#39;d like to learn before you die.... ALL<br/>\ninterests or topics you&#39;d like to learn before you leave this earth (<br/>\nor before you turn 90 or whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter listing all of these activities, tally them up.<br/>\nThen, go through your list and make a notation somewhere for every<br/>\nactivity you got proficient at by attending school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMakes you REALLY say &quot;none of that schooling helped in my adult life<br/>\nat all&quot; eh?!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy original also had something about listing all the degrees you&#39;ve<br/>\nearned and whether or not you were using them today. If you were using<br/>\nthem, the next question was; &quot;Do you LOVE your work? Are you<br/>\npassionate about what you do?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn one talk I did, someone actually had 2 or 3 items they said were<br/>\nlearned in school (that was out of 23ish I believe). After he gave me<br/>\nthat total I started questioning him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt turns out that one of the passions &quot;learned in school&quot; was a love<br/>\nof other cultures and geography. The way he learned about all that in<br/>\nschool? Well, he attended a really cool private school in EUROPE. Kids<br/>\nattended from all over the world and his EXPOSURE to all these people<br/>\nfrom different places is the way he learned about diversity and<br/>\nsparked this passion.<br/>\nI asked him if he thought a person could learn that just as easilly by<br/>\nexposing themselves to a wide range of people and places, rather than<br/>\nin school and he agreed wholeheartedly.<br/>\nSo it wasn&#39;t the schooling itself that helped him with this, it was<br/>\nthe sheer exposure, being surrounded by interesting people!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of his other interests, reading, was obviously something that<br/>\ncould be easily learned outside of school.<br/>\nSo by the end of exploring his school learning, he decided that the<br/>\nschool was actually irrelevant to his life today. The rich and varied<br/>\nexperiences were the thing that mattered.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat &quot;test&quot; is what Heidi is referring to in relation to Kevin&#39;s list<br/>\nof interests. You can all go give yourself the test now, if you have<br/>\nANY remaining doubts about unschooling.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7406,"nextTopicId":7321}}
