Most coffee, if gotten at a shop, has also sat in a caraf for a while, depending on the day and how busy we are, our coffee may sit for hours, by the endof the day it is really bitter. Espresso shots are brewed fresh and the process is much faster than brewing coffee. Coffee done in a French Press tends to be less bitter as well. Oh, and the quality of your water is really important, tap water can change the taste and bitterness of your coffee as well.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sorry if that was waayy more info than anyone wanted about coffee, I&#39;m recouping from a very busy and long weekend at work with coffee thoughts and talk floating around my brain...:p<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ~Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, Hobbes, some days even my lucky rocketship underpants don&#39;t help.&quot;<br/>\n-Calvin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

When I was growing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1984526560\">Our children (ages 15 & 13, and even our 4  year old sometimes) drink it occasionally, however, I used to forbid it  a couple years ago.  When I was growing up, I was not allowed to  drink it.  I could also not drink tea (hot or cold) when I was  younger.  So, when I became a mom, I did it this way too, thinking  that the caffiene was not good for them.  But, I let them drink  soda -- not a lot when they were younger, but more as they became teens<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Hubby is a big coffee drinker -- he drinks it everyday.  When we  began unschooling, I started thinking more about why I didn&#39;t allow it  and decided that I would leave the choice to the kids.  So, maybe  once a week or so, Noelle will get herself a cup.  Our 13-year-old  likes it too, but drinks it less often.  They also really like  frappachinos and such from places like Starbucks or other  coffeehouses.   Noelle and I really like drinking tea though,  so we tend to go for that more.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandie <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tableforfive.blogspot.com\">http://tableforfive.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homemadeliving.blogspot.com\">http://homemadeliving.blogspot.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

Does  <br/>\nthat count? He likes to sip it out of espresso cups, and it has to be  <br/>\ncoffee--warm milk, for instance, is not an acceptable substitute. He  <br/>\nlikes to have his coffee poured out of her cup into his, so part of  <br/>\nthe appeal for him is sharing what she has. She has not worried about  <br/>\nit even when people seem to look at her askance because he does not  <br/>\nseem to have any adverse reactions to the amount of caffeine he is  <br/>\ngetting, and he really loves it. Also, she has had people say to her,  <br/>\n&quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re letting him drink coffee!&quot; while their kid is  <br/>\ntwo feet away drinking a half-liter bottle of Coke, so it seems to  <br/>\nher that &quot;coffee is not for kids&quot; is a pretty arbitrary decision for  <br/>\nsome people, rather than being out of a concern about caffeine or  <br/>\nnutrition.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil I met her, I would not have let my kids have coffee. I would  <br/>\nhave said, &quot;Not for babies!&quot; But her argument is so reasonable, it  <br/>\nconvinced me. So now if my 20-month-old asks for a sip out of my cup,  <br/>\nI will let him try it.

But that&#39;s more because we&#39;re not big coffee drinkers <br/>\n(the coffee maker is in the closet collecting dust until the next <br/>\ntime we have guests). If my 7 yr old asked, we&#39;d give him a taste (a <br/>\nsmall serving of his own or a sip from our cup, whichever). Based on <br/>\npast history, my guess is he would probably not go for it - unless <br/>\nmaybe he went for my &#39;doctored&#39; version which is to take a packet of <br/>\ninstant cocoa, a half tsp or so of sugar, a little dairy (milk, <br/>\ncream, half&#39;n&#39;half, but NOT the dry non-dairy stuff), mix that to a <br/>\npaste then fill with coffee instead of hot water.
