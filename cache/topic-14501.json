If you<br/>\nlive your life fully, follow your passions and are constantly seeking<br/>\nnew information then you ARE doing research &quot;reports.&quot;  Especially if<br/>\nyou are coming back here and expressing your findings!  :-)  If you<br/>\nstrew for your kids and teach your kids to strew then that is just a<br/>\nform of research!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we all have our fears and concerns that are related to our own<br/>\ndisasterous school experiences.  Mine is math because I was always<br/>\ntold that I wasn&#39;t &quot;math smart.&quot;  I learned the numerals 4 and 5<br/>\nbackwards so I made horrid mistakes all the way through 8th grade<br/>\n(when a really good teacher figured it out for me!).  I can remember<br/>\nmy teachers telling my mom, &quot;She just doesn&#39;t get it.  Sometimes I<br/>\nthink she understands a mathematical concept and then she blows a huge<br/>\ntest.  She just isn&#39;t &#39;math smart.&#39;&quot;  I always thought I understood<br/>\nthe concepts but when I would do poorly on a test I would doubt<br/>\nmyself.  Now that my children are asking me 1,982 math questions a day<br/>\nI have come to realize that I truly do understand a lot more about<br/>\nmath than I was lead to believe.  But that &quot;not math smart&quot; still runs<br/>\nthrough my head.  I know that it is *my* problem, so I try not to<br/>\nstress about my children&#39;s &quot;lack of formal math education.&quot;  Heck,<br/>\nthey probably understand these math concepts better than I do because<br/>\nthey aren&#39;t hindered by the things that hindered me!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244909672,"authorName":"freepsgal","from":"&quot;freepsgal&quot; &lt;freepsgal@...&gt;","profile":"freepsgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: the Is it Enough posts.  :)","postDate":"1150209254","msgId":14501,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU2bWlkNys5NzQyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14506,"prevInTime":14500,"nextInTime":14502,"topicId":14501,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just went back and looked at the archives to find the original post.
