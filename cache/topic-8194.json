I&#39;m not blind, I see my parents for who they<br/>\nare, faults and all (which is why my children aren&#39;t being raised exactly<br/>\nthe same), but I love and respect them deeply. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYet this suggests that you are willing, even desirous, of embracing your<br/>\nparents&#39; faults or parenting defects - repeating their mistakes along with<br/>\ntheir positive ideas as if you have no other choice but to take all or<br/>\nnothing.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI read this ten times and kept reading &quot;*are* being raised exactly the<br/>\nsame&quot;..........<br/>\n<br/>\n!!!!Sorry!!!! about that to all, especially Yolanda if you ever come back -<br/>\nthe first two paragraphs of this post were based on a misread that totally<br/>\nreversed the meaning. (But still quit spanking!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe there are still some useful ideas in there - or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Also it is &quot;one size fits all&quot; parenting. Our children are not<br/>\nourselves. Our children are not clones of us or each other (even twins!).<br/>\nThey could have different needs than we may have had growing up and from<br/>\neach other. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this paragraph stands on its own better, as well as the rest of the<br/>\npost.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
