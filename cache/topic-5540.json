I feel like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde sometimes <br/>\nabout the computer games.  My daughter (12, currently in 6th grade) <br/>\nhas 13 more days of school, THEN we&#39;ll be <br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling/deschooling.  I know we both need LOTS of <br/>\ntime to adjust.   <br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently she&#39;s VERY into Runescape (before that it was Toontown <br/>\nOnline, which she said she&#39;s enjoys once in a while but is starting <br/>\nto &quot;outgrow&quot; and neopets).  I&#39;m the one that suggested Runescape to <br/>\nher, after someone on one of the yahoo groups (don&#39;t remember which <br/>\none) said their children enjoyed it.  She likes dragons/medieval and <br/>\ninteractive (live) on-line stuff.  I haven&#39;t actually looked at it <br/>\nmuch or watched her play much as I&#39;ve had too much going on, so I <br/>\nreally can&#39;t be fair in &quot;critiquing&quot; it or criticizing it.  It DOES <br/>\nseem really interesting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think what bothers me is that I know there are other things she&#39;s <br/>\nintersted in, and she&#39;ll find them or get to them in her own time, <br/>\nwhen she&#39;s ready.  And to be honest with myself, I have a lot of <br/>\nvaried interests, things I haven&#39;t had time to do when working full <br/>\ntime (and then having to work with her at night on &quot;homework&quot; aka <br/>\nbusywork much of the time) that I can&#39;t WAIT to get to.  I&#39;m <br/>\nprojecting my enthusiasm about our soon to be had freedom on to her <br/>\nand expecting her to feel differently (&quot;more like me&quot;).

I&#39;m very <br/>\ntired and need to sleep!

I&#39;ve been working towards this for over a <br/>\nyear (a lot has gone on in our lives this past year that I may not <br/>\nhave shared, perhaps another time), I&#39;ve held on for so long, it&#39;s <br/>\nhard to finally realize it&#39;s really going to happen, and soon! <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad to have a place like this from which to absorb some words of <br/>\nwisdom and experience.<br/>\nJann<br/>\n<br/>\nPS:  this site wouldn&#39;t come up, is something missing?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  www.unschoolinginfo/articles/article7.htm<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":173650678,"authorName":"Kim","from":"&quot;Kim&quot; &lt;knkmoran@...&gt;","profile":"knkmoran","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Limiting screen time / Trust / Help for Newbie Unschooler","postDate":"1118093174","msgId":5577,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ4MmYxbStqZDY0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5540,"nextInTopic":5578,"prevInTime":5576,"nextInTime":5578,"topicId":5540,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... their kids ... absolutely ...

It bothered me a lot at first, but I came to this<br/>\nlist and found some other local unschooling lists too and did a lot of<br/>\nreading.  I learned 2 important things that have helped me to relax<br/>\nand trust in unschooling:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. On average it takes 1 month of de-schooling for every year your<br/>\nchild has been schooled in the &quot;typical&quot; way (10 years for my son, so<br/>\nhe&#39;s still de-schooling and I&#39;m going to let him take all the time he<br/>\nneeds - regular school really damaged his confidence in himself!)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. It is amazing the wide variety of things someone can learn by<br/>\nplaying video games!  Below are some links I used to put together<br/>\ninformation for my son&#39;s portfolio review that he has this week. You<br/>\nwill find them totally encouraging and showing them to your husband<br/>\nmight help a lot too: <br/>\n<br/>\n www.geocities.com/Heartland/Hollow/1093/tvandvideogames.html<br/>\n<br/>\n sandradodd.com/games/page<br/>\n<br/>\n www.unschoolinginfo/articles/article7.htm<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as his interest widening, I do get books and magazines for him<br/>\non other subjects I know he is interested in too, then leave them in<br/>\nhis bedroom.  Sometimes, when I am sure he hasn&#39;t been doing anything<br/>\nbut playing games, I find the books on his nightstand and know he&#39;s<br/>\nbeen reading them on his own.  He has actually read quite a lot - and<br/>\nhe hated to read when he was in public school!  Unschooling does work<br/>\nif your child feels like he is making the decisions and not being forced.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n ~Kim<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":127741792,"authorName":"Hilary Jackson","from":"&quot;Hilary Jackson&quot; &lt;hilary@...&gt;","profile":"hilarylouisejackson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: Limiting screen time / Trust / Help for Newbie Unschooler","postDate":"1117539978","msgId":5540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5577,"prevInTime":5539,"nextInTime":5541,"topicId":5540,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Robyn, Thanks for your reply.

Perhaps he is feeling left out, especially as you are ill also and<br/>\npresumably unavailable. Not that I agree with his proposed solution to the<br/>\nproblem!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; to find my way to feeling OK about it. We ended the conv by him saying<br/>\nsomething like &quot;well, you should at least enforce that for a week&quot;. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to feel ok about a plan that sounds increasingly like a<br/>\npunishment. I like that he wants you to the dirty work of enforcement! My dh<br/>\nis like that too sometimes: &quot;I have this problem, here&#39;s how *you* fix it&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, I think trying to get at what your dh actually wants, rather than<br/>\nfocusing on what he doesn&#39;t want, might help. Even getting him to elucidate<br/>\nwhat the heck he hopes to gain by this limitation idea, might help him to<br/>\nrealize how counterproductive it is - he might talk himself out of it.(My dh<br/>\ndoes that sometimes too.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; He still seems so<br/>\n<br/>\nunmotivated, a little lost - he came out of school last July (remembering<br/>\nthat our summer break in NZ is December/January).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitely your son is still deschooling, and by others&#39; accounts this<br/>\nappearance of &quot;unmotivated&quot; is typical (almost universal!), as is the focus<br/>\non computer games.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you feel well soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
