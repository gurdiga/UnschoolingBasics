As Julie had expressed, most of the kids<br/>\nare really young. We&#39;ve been trying to recruit some<br/>\nolder ones with no great success. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve found a Sudbury School-type start-up in the area<br/>\nthat we&#39;re going to try this week. They meet once a<br/>\nweek at someone&#39;s house. From what I&#39;ve read, Sudbury<br/>\nisn&#39;t in conflict but supports unschooling principles,<br/>\nbut if anyone knows otherwise, please let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that some of you have hit upon something<br/>\nimportant as far as passions go. He is very much into<br/>\nvideo gaming, and part of letting go of his friends<br/>\nafter this summer, was losing their companionship in<br/>\nhis interests. Maybe we&#39;ll have to broaden a bit and<br/>\nget out more to see if anything else strikes his<br/>\nfancy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Here&#39;s an unschooling group I found in Las Vegas by<br/>\n&gt; googling &quot;las<br/>\n&gt; vegas unschoolers&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LVLifelearners/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LVLifelearners/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It takes time to create a wide circle of<br/>\n&gt; friends..hang in there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
