He&#39;s a &quot;fan&quot; of coercive methods and has  <br/>\nlong worked with children - with &quot;uneducatable children&quot; - children  <br/>\nof parents who don&#39;t do anything with them, neglect them and just  <br/>\ndon&#39;t care, so they start not going to school, playing in the cat&#39;s  <br/>\ntoilet, throwing with pooh, parents beating them and so on. He worked  <br/>\nfor the youth office to take care of these children. Now he&#39;s working  <br/>\nin a school were children have a lot of freedom in learning, though  <br/>\nthey still have some classes they have to attend. He says he sees  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t learn anything, and of course learning in freedom works,  <br/>\nif you&#39;re going to live in &quot;the jungle&quot; and don&#39;t need &quot;civilized&quot;  <br/>\nskills. Nobody would hire you without a good graduation certificate  <br/>\nblahblah. I avoided saying anything about my dream of not sending my  <br/>\ndaughter to school ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n*Talking to him*<br/>\n============<br/>\nWell anyway, I succeeded in explaining my new way of gentle  <br/>\nparenting, no punishments, no rules and no limitations, lots of help  <br/>\nand strewing etc. I also succeeded to avoid any labels  <br/>\n(&quot;unschooling&quot;, &quot;gentle parenting&quot;, or worse &quot;antiauthoritarian  <br/>\neducation&quot; (which is known by this name as the way the Hippies did in  <br/>\nthe 70&#39;s and has a very very  bad reputation around here for &quot;not  <br/>\nhaving worked&quot;))<br/>\n<br/>\n*His fight with my daughter*<br/>\n=====================<br/>\nIt was so cool, he was much more tolerant than I had expected (I was  <br/>\nnervous and had wanted to avoid the subject, but we had to talk about  <br/>\nit, because when I wasn&#39;t there, an argument arised between him and  <br/>\nmy daughter. He told her to &quot;bring the jacket upstairs&quot; and she said  <br/>\n&quot;I can decide on my own if I want to do that&quot; and he started yelling  <br/>\nat her &quot;YOU BRING THE JACKET UPSTAIRS BECAUSE I TELL YOU SO&quot; and so  <br/>\non, so she got histeric and shouted and cried, he packed her by her  <br/>\nshoulders and &quot;threw&quot; her in her room for being disrespectful and  <br/>\ntold her she was not allowed to come out until she &quot;calmed down&quot;. So  <br/>\nI had to explain why she reacted that way and we engaged in a  <br/>\npeaceful conversation about gentle parenting and our new ways).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*The outcome of our discussion*<br/>\n=========================<br/>\nI was so proud of him for understanding most of what I said, for  <br/>\nbeing respectful and so tolerant of other ways and open minded to  <br/>\nlisten. I was so proud of *me* for having soooo many arguments  <br/>\n(thanks to you, this list, and all those blogs and websites on  <br/>\nunschooling!) and for being able to respond to most of the &quot;typical&quot;  <br/>\nquestions! :-D He agreed on a lot of what I said, and he couldn&#39;t  <br/>\nquite make his point, at the end he just said &quot;well it sounds good,  <br/>\nbut i have the feeling there is *something* wrong with the concept,  <br/>\nbut I don&#39;t know exactly what it is yet; something bothers me about it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*My question*<br/>\n===========<br/>\nBut – There were a few questions/comments I couldn&#39;t respond to,  <br/>\nwould you help me out?:<br/>\n<br/>\n(Since this e-mail is already so long, I will only post a first  <br/>\nquestion and later on others if I don&#39;t forget...)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow will children learn that what you do/decide to do has a  <br/>\n(sometimes bad) *consequence*, if you don&#39;t let your child experience  <br/>\nit?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the one hand, he said I was pushing my responsibility (for her)  <br/>\nonto her. Because if her actions had bad consequences, *she* would be  <br/>\nthe one who would have to live with the consequence (bad teeth, a  <br/>\ncold, bad skills, being &quot;dumb&quot; because of TV etc, no friends for lack  <br/>\nof social skills, whatever (he didn&#39;t name these consequences, I&#39;m  <br/>\nmaking them up for better understanding)). I said that in any child  <br/>\nrearing &quot;technique&quot; the children are the ones who carry the  <br/>\nconsequences (but his point was that forcing the child to put on a  <br/>\njacket would *avoid* the bad consequence of a cold, for instance, and  <br/>\nit was my responsibility that she doesn&#39;t GET sick in the first place).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, he thought this approach would be OK (but meaner  <br/>\nthan just using coercive methods) if I would let her experience the  <br/>\ncold and the sickness, so she would &quot;learn the consequences of her  <br/>\nactions&quot; - but then I said that if she made a mistake, I wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>\nthere saying &quot;well - bad luck - you see how stupid a decission it was  <br/>\nto not bring the jacket? now live with the consequences&quot; – so I would  <br/>\neither have already brought a jacket and carried it myself until she  <br/>\nfelt cold, or given her mine or went home or bought one on the way  <br/>\nor... (creative solutions).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then he said, if I was *always* there for her, jumping in at  <br/>\nwhatever conflict/problem arose, how would she learn that in (&quot;real&quot;)  <br/>\nlife, all actions have consequences and that later on there wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nalways be somebody with an umbrella to rescue you from the  <br/>\nconsequences of standing with pyjamas in the rain?<br/>\n<br/>\nI only said that she&#39;d see what the consequences were anyway (oh,  <br/>\nit&#39;s cold if I don&#39;t bring a jacket), but she just didn&#39;t have to  <br/>\nsuffer the consequences and that at times it was more important to  <br/>\nlearn &quot;mommy will be there for me, I can count on her&quot;). I said I  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t imagine a child was so dumb as to conclude I would always be  <br/>\n&quot;serving&quot; him/her for the rest of my life, as my mother isn&#39;t doing  <br/>\nanymore (and never was, lol!) and that children usually become  <br/>\nindependent themselves all on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother argument would be, but it didn&#39;t come to my mind when we  <br/>\ntalked, is why would children who are forced to put on their jackets  <br/>\n*learn* that their actions have consequences – they don&#39;t even have  <br/>\nthe few minutes of experience like our children, until we pull out  <br/>\nthe jackets of our backpacks. Plus all the bad things they learn  <br/>\nabout their parents being mean, arbitrary, etc etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet, I feel there must be more to say about that... any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for reading and for making me strong to &quot;survive&quot; a  <br/>\nconversation with my father about it,<br/>\n<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nUnerzogen! | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dialog@...\">dialog@...</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unerzogen.de\">http://www.unerzogen.de</a> |  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unerzogen-subscribe@...\">unerzogen-subscribe@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18637,"nextTopicId":18652}}
