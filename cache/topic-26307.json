Yes, it hurt like crazy. More than my others but in the end it looks beautiful and I love it. I take extra care to put sunscreen on it so that I won&#39;t have to get it redone like I&#39;ve had to do with others that have faded because of sun exposure. It was well worth it. A little while of pain but the outcome is great (and permanent!) <br/>\nAubrey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Michelle Ravenstone <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, September 17, 2007 8:19 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re:foot tattoo with additional question!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have one on the top of my foot, but it&#39;s my only one (for now anyway....)<br/>\n  so I can&#39;t compare pain.
