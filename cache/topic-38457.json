My mom saw how much I disliked high school and neither one of us <br/>\nsaw the point in school-at-home. A lot of people just looked at me as <br/>\na high-school drop-out but my mom was very careful in telling me that <br/>\nI owned my experiences and learning, that school &quot;wasn&#39;t for <br/>\neveryone&quot;, that I had the choice to do whatever I wanted when I so <br/>\nchose. She empowered me, she reassured me. She made me feel like more <br/>\nthan just a &quot;drop-out&quot;. I don&#39;t regret that for a moment. I know I <br/>\ncould have chosen differently. I don&#39;t regret my choice or see her as <br/>\nbeing responsible for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, she raised me with conventional parenting - control, <br/>\npunishments/spanking, fighting between us. Those things are the <br/>\nthings that hurt our relationship, the things I wish were different. <br/>\nNot the trust, the support, the empowerment. I&#39;ll never regret those. <br/>\nThey were the highlight of my childhood. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Tara<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theorganicsister.com\">http://theorganicsister.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"N CONFER","from":"N CONFER &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Having doubts today","postDate":"1235579309","msgId":38481,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYxMzg5Mi45MDE1Mi5xbUB3ZWI4MzgxNS5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyMzU1NjY1NTcuNDg0LjYzNDU2Lm00NUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38469,"nextInTopic":38495,"prevInTime":38480,"nextInTime":38482,"topicId":38457,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t get it.This doesn t sound like writing a poem.

I think it should have been about enjoying poetry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* can *do* lots of things, but sometimes I want help or company while doing them.

Period.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what &quot;over-functioning&quot; could possibly be. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=- <br/>\n<br/>\nCan I really trust that this kid is going to get herself over her humps to<br/>\nachieve things in life?

Did you know whether you had options as a child?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children KNOW that they have many, many options. We try to make that very, very clear. We discuss parenting styles and learning styles. Ben and I try to be very accepting of Who They Are Now, so we can be the best parents we can be for them. We question our parenting a LOT----and ask the boys to question us too. If things aren&#39;t working as well as we&#39;d (all) like them to, we discuss what changes we can make *as a family* to make things better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling was illegal in SC when I was in school---so not an option. I was spanked regularly as a young child (until 11 or 12 for sure---maybe 13). No option. I didn&#39;t even know anyone who wasn&#39;t spanked until I was ten. THAT was eye-opening for me! So as a child, I was clueless that there was another way. But as an adult, I now resent that my parents were so &quot;tool-less&quot; as to spank me. I could resent that they didn&#39;t choose to homeschool me, but it wasn&#39;t an option, so I&#39;m cool with that. But I know how<br/>\n much more I *could* have done had I been homeschooled.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the unschooled teenagers who<br/>\nseem happy at camps and things... aren&#39;t they just like me?

They may not be motivated to do things *I* want them to do, but that&#39;s not what inner motivation is about. They often do things *for* me, but it&#39;s not because I make them; it&#39;s because they *want* to do kind things for me.

I&#39;m having a doubting day and I wonder what you people would have done<br/>\nin this situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur homeschool group is having a poetry and pizza day tomorrow. My 9 yo<br/>\ndaughter and I thought it was last week and got prepared for it then. She<br/>\nsaid to me, &quot;Come on, let&#39;s write out our poems,&quot; and I (surprised that she<br/>\nwould suggest it) agreed. We started and then looked at the calendar and<br/>\nwent, &quot;Oh, no, it&#39;s next week&quot; so we put the stuff away.<br/>\n<br/>\n****If we were excited and thought it was fun, we&#39;d just keep doing it, even<br/>\nthough it was needed until the next week.<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got to the table and I was sitting writing out my poem. She started,<br/>\nwrote about 6 words and then scribbled it out and sat looking at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything ok?&quot; I said?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My poem is too long. I can&#39;t do it.&quot; She said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh, really?&quot; I said, &quot;I think you probably could.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***I would have stayed with how she is feeling. I might have said, &quot;You<br/>\nthink you can&#39;t do it?&quot; or &quot;You are feeling frustrated.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No, I can&#39;t,&quot; she said. And then,<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Can you write it out for me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***I would say of course. And write it out.<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m writing out my own poem,&quot; I said. &quot;I don&#39;t really want to write yours<br/>\nout too. I&#39;m sure you can write it. Maybe just start with four lines or even<br/>\none line and go from there. You could do it a bit at a time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***I don&#39;t see how this is helpful. It seems unkind. It is also negating her<br/>\nfeelings without acknowledging them. She FELT like she couldn&#39;t. Sometimes<br/>\nmy kids need my gift of helping with something they are capable in doing.<br/>\nThey need me to be there for them in their time of need.<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nShe shook her head, and then just sat there.<br/>\n<br/>\n***How do you imagine she felt?<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You don&#39;t have to copy it out if you don&#39;t want to,&quot; I said. &quot;But I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to copy it out for you. You could go and do something different if you<br/>\nwant.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n****It seems like she needed you to help her or at least problem solve with<br/>\nher. You gave her an ultimatum. You do the writing or it doesn&#39;t get done. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what she needed but likely she would have. Perhaps in another<br/>\nsituation in the future you could ask her.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It seems we have a problem, you don&#39;t want to write out your poem but you<br/>\nwant one written. I am busy writing my own and I can&#39;t help you right now.<br/>\nWhat can we do about this?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is it because you felt strongly that she had to be the one to write it?<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe didn&#39;t give off happy vibes, and after two minutes went to her room, got<br/>\na different poem and started to copy that. She finished it all (actually, it<br/>\nwas much longer than the original one) and then I finished too.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I would have stopped copying my poem to be with her through this<br/>\nchallenging time.<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, in the evening, she happily read out her poem to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked her a little later how she felt about the writing and she said, &quot;I<br/>\ndon&#39;t like writing much and I don&#39;t have much confidence.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n****I would have talked with her a little more about that. What is she<br/>\nlacking confidence with? Is it that she lacks confidence in her creativity<br/>\nor in her handwriting or something else? Does she desire to improve it? Does<br/>\nshe just want help with making it &quot;perfect&quot;?<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, having seen from her notebook that she could put a whole page of words<br/>\ndown (it was an old notebook from school - she quit 12 months ago)<br/>\n<br/>\n****She and you are still de-schooling. That takes time, a lot of time<br/>\ndepending on the adults ability to let go of schooling thinking.<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n I knew she could write.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Yes but she asked for help. I can clean the whole house but sometimes I<br/>\nwant/need help.<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n I thought it was about getting over that &#39;starting&#39; hump<br/>\nthat I sometimes face when I set out on a project.<br/>\n<br/>\n****Her challenges may be different. At 9 my dd didn&#39;t like her handwriting<br/>\nbut was not interested in improving it. If she felt like she would be judged<br/>\nthen she may have wanted me to write it neatly. As far as creativity, she<br/>\nmight have needed me to write out fast so that she had the space to get her<br/>\nthoughts out in a flow rasther than struggle with the writing and the<br/>\nthinking. If it was just copying she would have found that rather tedious<br/>\nand not been interested. I would have done it for her. Not at 12 she is a<br/>\nvoracious writer. She writes a couple hours per day (by choice, she is<br/>\nwriting a novel)<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHas she lost confidence<br/>\nbecause she hasn&#39;t written in so long?<br/>\n<br/>\n***Ask her. Likely she had other issues or she is still hanging on the some<br/>\nschool thinking.<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n She has gone from being a child who<br/>\nbelieved she had a real talent for writing stories (and she does) to being<br/>\nsomeone who now hates writing and says she definitely doesn&#39;t want to be a<br/>\nwriter when she grows up - yet 8 months ago that was her dream - at least,<br/>\nthat&#39;s what she said.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Max, my 12dd has always been a story teller and then a writer. When she<br/>\ndiscovered that you could write stories down and have then told over and<br/>\nover again (3ish) She was ready to write! Yet she didn&#39;t have the skills<br/>\nyet. SO I wrote for her. I wrote for her for years. She slowly developed the<br/>\nskills to do her writing herself in private. By 9 she just wasn&#39;t there. She<br/>\nneeded me to help her a lot still. Writing was not comfortable or easy. And<br/>\nthat is ok. You don&#39;t need to write everyday or be forced to write to make<br/>\nit easier. Time takes care of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAS far as her dreams 8 months ago, well they will change a lot at this age.<br/>\nHeck I am 35 and I still change my goals a lot. I love to explore new things<br/>\nand ideas frequently. I have many dreams. Some I follow and some I let go,<br/>\nso do my kids. Having been unschooled their whole lives my kids have never<br/>\nthought about &quot;what do you want to be when you grow up&quot; they think in terms<br/>\nof &quot;I am a writer.&quot; or &quot;I write stories.&quot; They are very much living their<br/>\nown lives RIGHT NOW!<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the difference between strewing/helping/over-functioning?<br/>\n<br/>\n***I am not sure I get this question but heres my take. Strewing is when you<br/>\nleave things that you think someone might be interested laying around. I<br/>\nmight find a book about deconstruction clothes and show it to my 12dd<br/>\nbecause she my like it. Or I pick up a havndful of little toys at a ward<br/>\nsake and put it in t basket for my little ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone asks for herlp and I am able I give it to them. I don&#39;t concern<br/>\nmyself over whether they really need it or not. I figure if they are asking<br/>\nthey want it for one reason or the other. If I can help I will help them<br/>\nfind a way to get their needs met.<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I really trust that this kid is going to get herself over her humps to<br/>\nachieve things in life?<br/>\n<br/>\n***She will need you there as a loving guide. She will need your hands and<br/>\nheart to help her through.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t seem very self-motivated in a lot of<br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\n****Is that really true? Does she have no motivation in the things that<br/>\ninterest her most?<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nBut having written that, she has gotten herself through every book<br/>\nin the Harry Potter series - even when the words were too hard.... perhaps<br/>\nI&#39;m answering my own question.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***It seems she was interested.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nNext question: As a teen/young adult I would have said I was very very happy<br/>\nwith the way I was brought up and educated. It&#39;s only as I got into my 30s<br/>\nthat I got a lot of depression and realised my upbringing had a lot to do<br/>\nwith it (strict, &#39;good child&#39; type stuff). So the unschooled teenagers who<br/>\nseem happy at camps and things... aren&#39;t they just like me? Will they get<br/>\ninto their 30s and go, &quot;Man, my parents never made me do anything, and now I<br/>\nhave no inner motivation to get on with my life..?&quot; Crazy question?<br/>\n<br/>\n****I believe there is a great new group out where you can ask the grown up<br/>\ninschoolers yourself! Perhaps some one who isn&#39;t nursing can scrap up the<br/>\nlink. I don&#39;t think so though. It would be hard to blame your parents for<br/>\nsupporting and understanding you. Or for helping you find ways to met your<br/>\nneeds. Or for loving you and guiding you through life in a respectful way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be really weird for anyone to wish that someone would have<br/>\noppressed them. There would be bigger issues if someone was looking for more<br/>\nforce.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":341368225,"authorName":"The Patersons","from":"&quot;The Patersons&quot; &lt;tuipiri@...&gt;","profile":"tuipiri","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Having doubts today","postDate":"1235467114","msgId":38457,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGIwMWM5OTY2MCRkZTZmOTA1MCQ5YjRlYjBmMCRAY29tLmF1Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":38458,"prevInTime":38456,"nextInTime":38458,"topicId":38457,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi.
