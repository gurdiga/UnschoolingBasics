I worry about the same  <br/>\nthing. How will they cope? I had a majorly rough time after the birth of my  <br/>\nyoungest, so much so that I was having nightmares of my own funeral. Yeah,  morbid, <br/>\nand terrifying. Thankfully, THOSE have dwindled down to maybe once a  month, <br/>\nbut the worry is still there.<br/>\nI think the worry part is natural. I am also a big worrier. I worry about  my <br/>\nhusband commuting, at work... I worry when the kids are out of my sight... I  <br/>\njust deal with it. My husband humors me though, calls me on his breaks, on <br/>\nhis  way home. <br/>\nI&#39;ve thought about talking to a professional about it, but, once again, I&#39;m  <br/>\nworried they&#39;ll think I&#39;m psychotic (I&#39;m not, really) and want me on meds or  <br/>\nwhatever. So, I just try to push all negative thoughts of worry out the second <br/>\n they try to weasel in. And, instead, rely on my gut feelings.

BUT instead of stewing, I -plan-. I&#39;m the sole <br/>\nincome in our family and DH is at home with DS (sounds similar to <br/>\nyour situation). So, I make sure (a) that I do what I can as far as <br/>\ngeneral health goes (b) that we have insurance that will cover them <br/>\nfor 6 months to a year&#39;s worth of expenses (mortgage, utilities, <br/>\nfood, etc) so that they can take some time to explore their options <br/>\nrather than a panicked jump into something. For instance, even <br/>\nthough our mortgage has a penalty if you move in less than 10 yrs <br/>\n(through the state, they want to build &#39;stable&#39; neighborhoods) BUT <br/>\nif there is a death or divorce, that is waived (if I remember <br/>\ncorrectly). So, they could find someplace else to live (cut expenses <br/>\na bit perhaps) and extend that time. DH and I have discussed things <br/>\nas well and it is likely that my guys would be able to arrange <br/>\nsomething - and it gets more and more likely and easier as DS gets <br/>\nolder. He&#39;s 7 now but it won&#39;t be long until he&#39;s 12 or 13 and can <br/>\nstay home by himself or go to a friend&#39;s house for the day or <br/>\nsomething like that. Also, one of my SIL&#39;s (DH&#39;s middle sister) is <br/>\nthe daycare provider for our nephew and a couple of other children, <br/>\nso we could possibly arrange that as well. And, it would be perhaps <br/>\npossible that DH could actually take over my job (he has the skill <br/>\nset to do it) - it&#39;s a pretty family friendly company and DS could <br/>\ncome to work with DH or DH could work some from home and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m (longwindedly) saying is instead of worrying about <br/>\nhow they&#39;ll do in school if you die, make plans that would give them <br/>\nand DH -options- should that happen so they can take time and decide <br/>\nIF school is where they -want- to be or if there needs to be other <br/>\narrangements. It&#39;s not an either/or black and white situation. There <br/>\nare lots of gray areas. And the older the kids get, the more options <br/>\nopen up.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175529137,"authorName":"Donald and Sandra Winn","from":"Donald and Sandra Winn &lt;aplan4life@...&gt;","profile":"aplan4life","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Hello, I&#39;m new to the group...Sorry for delayed intro...","postDate":"1127414800","msgId":6756,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwOTIyMTg0NjQwLjc0NjM1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzMDA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6759,"prevInTime":6755,"nextInTime":6757,"topicId":6756,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, We ve been homeschooling for 3 years and I ve finally decided to go with unschooling after much deliberation.

My daugher 7, has never been to school<br/>\nbut I did teach her to read, write and do math in her<br/>\nyounger years.  There was always so much time left for<br/>\nher that she has not been negatively impacted. <br/>\nLearning to her is a joy.  OTH, my son was in the<br/>\nsystem for from 3-8 and then I schooled at home with<br/>\nhim too, never settling in on anything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m fortunate to live in Pensacola near Ren, who :-(<br/>\nwill be moving.  Anyway, she has been a wonderful<br/>\ninspiration to me in not just unschooling but with<br/>\nanother area that is very emotional for me.  She<br/>\naccepted me with open and loving arms and has been the<br/>\nsingle most factor in my decision to unschool.  For<br/>\nthe past few days, I&#39;ve been at her new website,<br/>\npouring over the wealth of information.  It is my hope<br/>\nto become as wonderful and relaxed about unschooling<br/>\nas you all are.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all honesty, it is myself that needs to overcome<br/>\nthings and especially about my son.  I&#39;ve been a<br/>\n&quot;worrier&quot; all of my life and it is eating &quot;me&quot; up to<br/>\nsee him not really be a go getter.  However, I know it<br/>\nis ME that needs to change.  He is loving Harry Potter<br/>\nright now so I am not complaining!  He used to hate<br/>\nreading and he has made it through the first 4 books<br/>\nalready in less than a month, he eats those books up. <br/>\nHe generally though is not very ambitious.  He&#39;ll be<br/>\nexcited to do something and the second a little<br/>\nthought is required, he gets a defeated attitude.  I<br/>\ntry to be supportive but he&#39;d just rather not even<br/>\ntry.  Of course, this is my main concern because I<br/>\ncan&#39;t help but see this going into adulthood. <br/>\nHowever, I love him where he is at but am worried<br/>\nabout his future.  Also, I do realize that this has A<br/>\nLOT to do with being schooled much of his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, on Ren&#39;s site I read that if a child has<br/>\nchoices but still isn&#39;t happy then something is wrong.<br/>\n I asked Zachary if he was happy and he said yes.  We<br/>\nspoke about how he has freedom to choose what to learn<br/>\nand he got so excited about having a chemistry set. In<br/>\nthe past, I&#39;ve &quot;tried&quot; to unschool but unsuccessfully,<br/>\nI&#39;d panic and we&#39;d start in with a schoolish type<br/>\napproach.  Lately though, I was reminded of Zak and<br/>\nhow much he learned about Egypt and it wasn&#39;t because<br/>\nI taught him anything, he asked for things about Egypt<br/>\nand we got em&#39;.  I haven&#39;t a clue why I panic other<br/>\nthan because &quot;they don&#39;t know what the school kids<br/>\nknow.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest and STUPIDEST stumbling block to<br/>\nunschooling has been concern about me dieng.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow why, I just do.  I think &quot;if I die what will<br/>\nhappen to the kids?&quot;  DH will have to work and they&#39;d<br/>\nnever make it into school, I&#39;d have failed them and<br/>\nonly made things harder.

My children are totally unaware of<br/>\nmy what &quot;iffing&quot; because I do not want that habit to<br/>\nrub off on them, they are clueless to my concerns<br/>\nabout this area.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I realize that that is a little deep, but I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen watching the posts for a few days and see much<br/>\nwisdom here.  Maybe somebody knows someone who has the<br/>\nsame concerns and would be able to share how they have<br/>\novercome them, regardless of how petty they may seem. <br/>\n:-)  Looking forward to learning more about this<br/>\nwonderful path of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely<br/>\n~Sandy Winn<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
