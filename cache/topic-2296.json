I was<br/>\nsimply debating the fact that reading (like unschooling or talking or<br/>\nlearning anything, really) has a process.  Everything we learn has a<br/>\nprocess.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t believe the above need to exist in the learner in order to<br/>\nread. My Jared NEVER learned any kind of phonics.<br/>\nThat&#39;s just false.  In order to become a proficient reader, one needs to<br/>\nknow all of the things I mentioned.  I wasn&#39;t saying that we need to &quot;teach&quot;<br/>\nthese things, or that we even need to know these things.  Just that they<br/>\nexist as part of the process of reading.  If your son reads, then he knows<br/>\nphonics.  He doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;taught&quot; phonics or even verbalize phonics<br/>\nrules.  But he does know phonics if he reads.  (and if he doesn&#39;t now, he<br/>\nwill know it at some point.)  English is an alphabetic language, not a<br/>\nsymbolic one.  In order to read new words, we must know how to sound them<br/>\nout.  We do this even as adults.  (Try reading the ingredients on the back<br/>\nof your shampoo bottle!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t need to know anything about what you printed. They need to<br/>\nbe trusted. Reading isn&#39;t really this big magical thing people make it<br/>\nout to be. Your child learned to speak an entire language without<br/>\nknowing &quot;processes&quot;, why wouldn&#39;t they learn other things the same way?<br/>\nI explained above why I believe that they do need to know what I printed in<br/>\norder to read.  However, I agree with you about the rest.  Just because<br/>\nthere is a process, doesn&#39;t mean that we need to know it.  My son will tell<br/>\nyou that he learned to read on his own, because I didn&#39;t push or name this<br/>\nprocess.  (Though I can&#39;t help knowing what I already know.)  I really do<br/>\nbelieve that if you trust children to learn on their own, they will learn.<br/>\nJust like when they learned to talk.  There is so much pressure on schools<br/>\nto &quot;teach&quot; reading, that I think that pressure is put on parents as well.<br/>\nNo one pressures us to &quot;teach&quot; our children to talk, so we don&#39;t push it.<br/>\nBut when people think of learning to read, they get nervous if their child<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know how to do it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping people understand what learning looks like in unschooling<br/>\nhomes is more helpful than posting all about what kids &quot;need&quot; to<br/>\nunderstand in order to learn certain things.<br/>\nMy point wasn&#39;t what children &quot;need&quot; to know, it was that there is a process<br/>\nto reading.  Isn&#39;t that helpful to know that reading is a process?  Children<br/>\ndon&#39;t just read or not read.  It is a process.  Just like I don&#39;t fully<br/>\ngrasp unschooling all the way.  I&#39;m in the middle of the process of learning<br/>\nhow to implement unschooling into my life.  When I first understood that it<br/>\nis a PROCESS (unschooling), I felt so much better about not knowing<br/>\neverything there is to know about unschooling.  I realized that it will come<br/>\neventually, in its own natural path.<br/>\n<br/>\nI figured it would be helpful if people, who are worried about their<br/>\nchildren&#39;s reading journey, understood that reading is a process.  Maybe<br/>\ntheir child is in the middle of that process right now, and if they<br/>\nrecognize that, they can relax a little.  (I understand the point of<br/>\nunschooling is to NOT worry about what your child is learning in the first<br/>\nplace, but in reality, we do worry when our child isn&#39;t reading--especially<br/>\nthose of us just beginning this journey.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally disagree with the concept that school isn&#39;t all bad and they<br/>\nsimply fail to meet individual needs. I think teaching is harmful in<br/>\ngeneral because it places the power outside the individual. What it<br/>\nreally teaches them is that they NEED to be taught in order to learn!<br/>\nIt&#39;s harmful and demoralizing and schools are feeding that harm every day.<br/>\nI agree.  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t send my children to school.  But many people<br/>\ndo--some of them feel like they have no choice but to send their children to<br/>\nschool.  And I really don&#39;t believe that teachers and school authorities are<br/>\nbad in nature.  If someone gave me a classroom full of kids and told me to<br/>\nteach them to read, I would probably end up doing what they do in schools.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not ideal, or even the best senerio.  But if these kids have to go to<br/>\nschool, that&#39;s how they&#39;ll have to learn.  Some do learn.  And some don&#39;t.<br/>\nThe teachers there are doing the best that they can, with what they know.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers are living as if school and it&#39;s &quot;processes&quot; didn&#39;t exist.<br/>\nBut schools (and their processes) DO exist.  Many people on this list are<br/>\nhere because they love the idea of unschooling, but are very aware that they<br/>\nare going against mainstream society&#39;s beliefs about education.  They<br/>\nbelieve that unschooling is the right thing to do, but have questions<br/>\nregarding what they&#39;ve been &quot;taught&quot; about education and learning, etc.  I<br/>\nthink it is very important to have discussions about unschooling vs. school<br/>\nand the difference in their philosophies about learning.  I assumed that<br/>\nthis list was the forum to do that.  If not, I sincerely apologize and I<br/>\nwill find a more appropriate place to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t trying to start a fight here, I am trying to understand unschooling<br/>\nin a way that is meaningful to me (and hopefully others out there).   Being<br/>\na former teacher, education and learning is what I know (or thought I<br/>\nknew!).  That is the place I am coming from as I start my journey to<br/>\nunschool.  WHile I generally agree with the unschooling philosophy, there<br/>\nare obviously some points that go against what I believe to be true.  I<br/>\nfully understand that when I post some of the things that I&#39;ve posted here,<br/>\nI will get an opposing viewpoint.  That&#39;s why I do it.

I&#39;m reading loads of information about the flawed way schools &quot;teach&quot; kids to read here. I&#39;m *so* much more interested in hearing how unschoolers &quot;learn&quot; to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJodi~<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had a year of unschooling my 5, 8 and 13 year old.  I was home-schooling before that.  I did introduce the alphabet to my 8 year old last year.  I did it &quot;the waldorf way&quot;, which is drawing pictures and telling a story for each letter.  Like a long wonderful story about a Mountain, and all the marvelous magicians that gathered there each Hallow&#39;s Eve.  I drew the picture so that the mountain looked like an M--sort of.  I left it at that.  I did not bring awareness to my hidden M, but just drew the picture while I told the stories with lots of M words mixed in (15 minutes or so).  The next day, I finally drew attention to the M, and he loved every letter like this.  After the letters were introduced, he wanted to &quot;learn to read&quot;.  So, I bought &quot;Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons.&quot;  He chose it.  He loved it and did 88 lessons this year and then declared &quot;I do not EVER want to do another lesson.  I do not need nor want you to &quot;teach&quot; me anything more.  I do not EVER want to do anything that is like School again, and I know how to read.&quot;  WOW.  I had thought he had enjoyed himself, as he was happy during and after these 15 minute &quot;lessons&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, guess what?  I have not done another thing.  That was 3 months ago, and he reads everything he sees....he tries.  The book gave him the basic sounds, not really phonics, but more base sounds and allowed a lot of reading to occur with the new found sounds.  The stories were funny, not dumb.  Anyway, I watch closed caption TV at night when I go to bed, and since we all share the same bedroom for sleeping (this is an ebb and flow in itself!), he reads as much as he can from that, and only gets a few words before they disappear and are replaced with others.  He seems to be doing very well!  He is motivated to read those words, as he loves TV at night---like I might be watching Numbers, or the News (edited to not have the gore--I change the channel) and he loves to feel more grown up and read all about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe reads and spells so he can search for Star Wars toys on the Internet and I read to him, he listens to Stories on CD a lot as well.  He has no interest in sitting down &quot;to read&quot; nor writing anything at all.  I cringe, I am not used to letting things BE.  I am trying to allow, to adjust, to BE myself so that they can BE themselves.  I do see though, that he is persisting ALL ON HIS OWN.  Just like when he learned to talk.  It is really exactly the SAME process.  And the 5 year old is following behind.  Asking all the time...&quot;how do you spell GIVE BACK?&quot; for instance.  I tell him, I sound out the letters a bit......some he guesses, we refer to all letters at pictures, like A is teepee, E is a diving board for all 3 brothers, M, mountain, N-nightcrawler, B-big belly B, D-Door etc.  It makes it fun, not schoolish work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelley<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandandstardust.blogspot.com/\">http://sandandstardust.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Childhood is a journey, not a race.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Reading","postDate":"1207700187","msgId":31680,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ0aDFzcitrZ2cyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA0MDgwOTUzajYzMTExZjA5eDZiODQwN2U5MTYxMDU5ZGVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":31679,"nextInTopic":31682,"prevInTime":31679,"nextInTime":31681,"topicId":2296,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Just this evening Alex <br/>\nhad the &#39;need&#39; to learn about astrology in order to understand something <br/>\nabout himself and his friends better. He was reading a German and an English <br/>\nbook at the same time. My &#39;teaching&#39; part was to provide quick translations <br/>\nbetween the two languages of  sun signs and planet names when asked. He <br/>\ncould have looked these up in the dictionary, of course. :)  In the <br/>\n&#39;schooling&#39; mindset I would have told him to get the dictionary. In the <br/>\nunschooling mindset of course I provided the answers in the same way as I <br/>\nwould provide it to any other person asking the question. And if he would <br/>\nhave asked me to read it to him I might have done that, too.<br/>\nI have a mother who gives information unasked. It is extremely irritating. <br/>\n:) And I catch myself so often when I want to do the same thing. Sometimes I <br/>\ncan keep my blabbermouth shut. &lt;grin&gt; Sometimes I don&#39;t and the backlash is <br/>\npainful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t remember where I read it but there was a reference to the need for <br/>\nfood and the need for sleep and the need for skill or knowledge.

I&#39;m<br/>\n*so* much more interested in hearing how unschoolers &quot;learn&quot; to read<br/>\nBy reading and being read to and being surrounded by the printed word<br/>\n(it&#39;s nearly impossible to avoid words in our society these days even if<br/>\nALL you ever do is watch TV). How do -you- learn something new? For<br/>\ninstance, if you see a friend making an awesome pan of lasagna right<br/>\ndown to making the whole wheat noodles, and you think &quot;gee I&#39;d like to<br/>\nbe able to do that&quot; What do you do? Do you go find a lasagna making<br/>\nclass and make sure you&#39;re between the ages of 20-22 (the proper<br/>\nlearning to make lasagna age)? Probably not. You might pull out a<br/>\ncookbook and by trial and error (hopefully some of it edible) come up<br/>\nwith your own process and off you go. You might ask your friend to show<br/>\nit to you, explain it to you, hang out next to you while you try your<br/>\nfirst go at it. Odds are neither the cookbook nor your friend will quiz<br/>\nyou about proper technique, protein ratios, etc. Rather, your friend<br/>\nmight notice that the dough looks a little dry from her experience and<br/>\nsuggest adding a little more water to the dough before rolling it out.<br/>\nSame thing with unschooled kids learning to read - they may ask<br/>\nquestions, they may work it on their own, probably a bit of both, and<br/>\nour job is to be alongside as much or as little as they choose to assist<br/>\nin whatever way they choose. I could tell you about when DS learned to<br/>\nread but it&#39;d just be my perspective on what was happening, it wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nactually be 100% accurate as to what was going on inside him - just as I<br/>\ncould tell you what he had for dinner last night but I couldn&#39;t 100%<br/>\naccurately tell you how it digested once he ate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how did DS learn (he was right around 5 when he reached a level of<br/>\ncomfort and fluency that would be called &#39;reading&#39;, he&#39;s almost 10 now)?<br/>\nWe had magnets and books and closed captioning and road signs and<br/>\ngrocery lists and all that various stuff that most families with kids<br/>\nhave around. We&#39;d read to him as he chose (and sometimes he was busy<br/>\nplaying with something while we read, he was not required to sit still<br/>\nand look at the pages). We read on our own (both DH and I are<br/>\nbibliophiles bigtime). I near about sprained my tongue pronouncing<br/>\n&quot;mrwtqzgjkln&quot; when he assembled fridge magnet letters and said &quot;Mommy,<br/>\nwhat does that say?&quot; - we also had a discussion about how some vowels<br/>\n(aeiou) are helpful for Mommy to not sprain her tongue because the<br/>\nEnglish language needs vowels (of course, then I had &quot;uioeoia&quot; to try to<br/>\nwrap my poor tongue around lol). Over time, he learned to recognize some<br/>\nwords and figure out others based on their similarity to other words he<br/>\nalready knew. That was pretty much it. I knew for certain he was<br/>\n&quot;reading&quot; when he popped his head in one day when DH and I were in<br/>\nanother room and said &quot;there&#39;s a severe thunderstorm watch until 10 pm&quot;<br/>\n- he had read the scroll feed across the bottom of the TV screen. That&#39;s<br/>\nthe best I can do to &#39;explain&#39; how he learned to read - he learned to<br/>\nread by reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

My oldest has always had an  <br/>\ninterest in reading for as long as I can remember.  Seems he was just &quot;born  that <br/>\nway&quot;  LOL.  We have always read as a family, still do.  I  don&#39;t think you ever <br/>\n&quot;outgrow&quot; the joy of being read to.  So we have always  had lots of books <br/>\naround and have always been a reading family.  My oldest  however has loved those <br/>\ngaming magazines since he was like 3.  I remember  him following me around all <br/>\nday wanting me to read the magazines to him, and I  would, over and over and <br/>\nover and over.  He LOVED them.  And I don&#39;t  think I was quite fast enough for <br/>\nhim.  He just had to be able to read them  for himself.  Skip parts he didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to read, back up and read  paragraphs again etc.  He would ask me how to <br/>\nspell words, he would copy  words on paper, he would ask me to read words for <br/>\nhim, he learned how to sound  out more difficult words.  And he learned to <br/>\nread by the age of about  4.  He knew he just HAD TO READ FOR HIMSELF.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy youngest was different.  He also loved being read to and lived in  the <br/>\nvery same environment.  But was very content for me to read to  him.  He did not <br/>\nhave that same &quot;NEED&quot; to read everything himself.   Several years ago he went <br/>\nthrough a period of wanting me to spell words for him  and he would write them <br/>\ndown on paper.  But then that stopped.  He  called himself a nonreader for a <br/>\nwhile.  Although we have a great circle of  unschooling friends we hang around <br/>\nso for him there was no &quot;negative&quot; attachment  to that (I think in society as <br/>\na whole the majority would look at being a  nonreader at 9 as a negative <br/>\nthing).  Our circle of friends were/are so  diverse in the age they started <br/>\nreading that it wasn&#39;t any deal at all, big or  small.  LOL.  But inside his head he <br/>\nwas absorbing things, it wasn&#39;t  as &quot;out there&quot; as my older son.  Then one <br/>\nday this past year (he is 10 now)  he just started reading these difficult <br/>\nwords.  It seems to me that he went  from reading &quot;no&quot;, &quot;mom&quot;, &quot;dad&quot; to reading <br/>\nEVERYTHING, in a day.  Although  I am sure there was a process going on inside <br/>\nhim, it just wasn&#39;t out there for  me to see like with my older son.  So now in <br/>\nwhat seems like a year he can  read generally anything.  It is so amazing.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo I have one that started reading around 4 and one that started around  10.  <br/>\nVery different processes for each of them.  Both in their own  time, but <br/>\nneither in a vacuum.

I&#39;m still a<br/>\n&quot;newbie&quot; with unschooling, so this is my experience<br/>\nbefore we found unschooling.  I love reading and I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t wait to pass that love on to my children. <br/>\nThere was some annoying parents that tried to push<br/>\ntheir kids to read at age 3 and I said to myself that<br/>\nI didn&#39;t care how old they were when they learned to<br/>\nread, as long as they loved to read.  Then school<br/>\nhappened!  When my oldest wasn&#39;t picking up on how to<br/>\nread by 1st grade, I panicked.  She was tested, and<br/>\ntested, and tested and found out that she was<br/>\ndyslexic.  She got so much help and still was<br/>\n&quot;behind&quot;.  And now she hated reading, and didn&#39;t see<br/>\nherself as a reader.  :(  The best &quot;help&quot; I have given<br/>\nher was to back off.  No more phonics, sounding out,<br/>\ncorrections and testing!!!  And guess what...she now<br/>\nloves reading again!  That&#39;s what I most wanted and<br/>\njust lost sight of.  And I realized that not everyone<br/>\nis going to love reading like I do and that&#39;s OK!   My<br/>\ndh doesn&#39;t read for enjoyment.  But he&#39;s an extremely<br/>\nintelligent man &lt;proud wife ;) &gt; and reads for<br/>\ninformation all the time. He reads high tech,<br/>\ncomplicated, scientific stuff, so he&#39;s probably more<br/>\nof a &quot;reader&quot; than I am,  it&#39;s just a different kind<br/>\nof reading.  And  I&#39;ve noticed my son isn&#39;t into<br/>\nstories but loves looking at his reptile or Bioncle<br/>\nbooks, so I&#39;m not going to be disappointed if he&#39;s<br/>\njust like his dad ;) <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
