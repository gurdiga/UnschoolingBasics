There are mindful parents I know, that do<br/>\nsome things in a more conventional manner. The difference is they<br/>\nlisten and try to understand their children, are calm and kind etc...<br/>\nBUT, I can&#39;t separate respecting my children in certain areas, but not<br/>\nin others. It doesn&#39;t make sense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think those that are more mindful in LIFE (not just parenting) are<br/>\nmost capable of navigating this journey we&#39;re on. Mindfulness is a<br/>\nhigh level of awareness, a way of BEING that transcends circumstances.<br/>\nThe more mindful we are, the more balanced/healthy and successful we<br/>\nare in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMindfulness as applied to parenting fosters deep and abiding trust<br/>\nbetween ourselves and our children. It&#39;s important for that awareness<br/>\nto be present for this Radical unschooling thing to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was talking at the conference with some people I admire very much.<br/>\nWe discussed that the FREEDOM part is only half of the picture!!<br/>\nKids running amok, damaging property or not being concerned about how<br/>\nthey affect anyone is NOT radical unschooling. AWARENESS must be<br/>\npresent for the freedom part to work well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think that some manner of conventional parenting (rules,<br/>\nbedtimes etc..) is better than freedom without awareness. They go<br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14723,"nextTopicId":14745}}
