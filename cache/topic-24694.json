No matter how wonder-filled a vacation trip is, it is always <br/>\ngreat to<br/>\n<br/>\nget back home.   Today, I unloaded the rocks and minerals (mostly <br/>\nquartz<br/>\n<br/>\ncrystals) that Nancy and I collected.   After moving all the boxes, I <br/>\nestimate the<br/>\n<br/>\ncombined weight to be a bit over 700 pounds.   Of course, by the time <br/>\nwe give<br/>\n<br/>\nspecimens to all our friends, decorate the gardens at both the Garden <br/>\nHouse<br/>\n<br/>\nand the Beach House, and fill the curio cabinets, we may have to go <br/>\nback to<br/>\n<br/>\ncollect more.   If you have not seen all the fun we had, check it out <br/>\non my blog:<br/>\n<br/>\n http://www.thehappyscientist.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************<br/>\n<br/>\nThis week&#39;s experiment is one that we used for teaching about birds <br/>\nback when<br/>\n<br/>\nI worked in the Education Department at the Memphis Pink Palace Museum. <br/>\n  On<br/>\n<br/>\nour trip, we went by to say Hi to old friends, which brought back tons <br/>\nof<br/>\n<br/>\ngreat memories.   This is one of the fun things my brain dredged up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at some bird nests.   You can either search your yard ( just look, <br/>\ndon&#39;t<br/>\n<br/>\ntouch or bother the nest), visit your local Nature Center, or search <br/>\nthe<br/>\n<br/>\nInternet.   A quick Google Image search for &quot;bird nest&quot; came up with <br/>\nover 175,000<br/>\n<br/>\nimages of bird nests.   Look at the wide variety of nests, from huge <br/>\nBald<br/>\n<br/>\nEagle nests that can weigh more than a ton, to the marvelous nests that<br/>\n<br/>\nHummingbirds build from spider webs.   They truly are amazing, but how <br/>\nhard are they to<br/>\n<br/>\nbuild.   That is what we will find out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo try this, you will need:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTweezers<br/>\n<br/>\nseveral marbles<br/>\n<br/>\nsticks<br/>\n<br/>\ngrass<br/>\n<br/>\nstring<br/>\n<br/>\nleaves<br/>\n<br/>\nhair<br/>\n<br/>\nother things you may find in your yard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, the task is simple.   Collect your materials from the yard, and <br/>\nthen try<br/>\n<br/>\nto build a bird nest.   You can select from anything in your yard that <br/>\na bird<br/>\n<br/>\nmight use.   Think about the different nests you have seen, and what <br/>\nthey were<br/>\n<br/>\nmade of.   Sounds like an easy project, right?   Oh, one more thing.   <br/>\nYou<br/>\n<br/>\nhave to collect the materials and build the nest using the tweezers.   <br/>\nBirds<br/>\n<br/>\ndon&#39;t have hands, and most of them make very little use of their feet <br/>\nin nest<br/>\n<br/>\nbuilding.   For most birds, their single tool is their beak.   You <br/>\ndon&#39;t have a<br/>\n<br/>\nbeak, so you get to use the tweezers instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour goal is to make a nest that would sit in a tree or a bush, and <br/>\nthat<br/>\n<br/>\nwould hold several bird eggs, or in our case, glass marbles.   Trees <br/>\nand bushes<br/>\n<br/>\nare exposed to the wind, so the nest has to be sturdy enough so that it <br/>\nwill<br/>\n<br/>\nhold the marbles, even when you shake the nest to simulate wind blowing <br/>\nthe bush.<br/>\n<br/>\n   You are limited to materials a bird would use.   That rules out <br/>\nwrapping<br/>\n<br/>\nyour nest in Duct tape or using glue to hold it together.   Some birds <br/>\ndo use<br/>\n<br/>\ntheir sticky saliva as a glue to hold the nest in place.   In fact, <br/>\nnests made<br/>\n<br/>\n from the saliva of certain cave swifts are used to make Birds Nest <br/>\nSoup, a<br/>\n<br/>\nChinese delicacy.   Yum!   I love Birds Nest Soup, even though I know <br/>\nit is made<br/>\n<br/>\nof bird spit.   Feel free to use spit on your nest, if you think that <br/>\nwill<br/>\n<br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you are done with your nest, test it with the marbles and some <br/>\ngentle<br/>\n<br/>\nshaking.   If it holds together, congratulations!   Take a photo and <br/>\nemail it to<br/>\n<br/>\nme.   I will post the nests on my blog <br/>\n(http://www.thehappyscientist.com).<br/>\n<br/>\nBe sure to send your name, age, and what materials you used, to post <br/>\nwith your<br/>\n<br/>\nnest photo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you are done, look back over the photos of the bird nests.   You <br/>\nshould<br/>\n<br/>\nthen have a true appreciation of the skill these amazing creatures <br/>\nhave, to<br/>\n<br/>\nbuild such elaborate structures with just their beak.   Imagine trading <br/>\nin your<br/>\n<br/>\nhands for a beak.   Just imagine how much work it would be to eat an <br/>\nentire<br/>\n<br/>\nbowl of ice cream with just a beak!   Now that is something worth <br/>\nexperimenting<br/>\n<br/>\nwith!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a wonder-filled week!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert Krampf<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert Krampf&#39;s Science Education Company<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.krampf.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Happy Scientist Blog<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://web.mac.com/krampf/iWeb/Site/TheHappyScientist/TheHappyScientist.html<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nThis weekly e-mail list is provided free of charge.
