My daughter and I Metamorphosis too much!<br/>\nhaha<br/>\n<br/>\nI have let her figure out what she is, not what we are.  Her and I are quite<br/>\ndifferent in our approaches.  I use lots of reference books, etc. I really<br/>\nenjoy them.  She reads fiction.  So, it&#39;s really not us, it&#39;s her and then<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if someone is truly interested in what we are and is genuine in their<br/>\nsearch, I&#39;ll say, &quot;I&#39;m a Whole Learner she is Life Learner, but you might<br/>\nwant to ask her directly.&quot;    If someone is being a pest and just asking so<br/>\nthey can debate how invalid our choices are, I&#39;ll throw out that we are both<br/>\nRU&#39;s.  Just because adding that word Radical tends to scare people.  haha<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason, out here in NM whenever I use the term unschooling people<br/>\nsay it is negative.  So, out here...I really try not to use it.  Hmmm, I<br/>\nnever had that problem in CA.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Millers in NM</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8750,"nextTopicId":8756}}
