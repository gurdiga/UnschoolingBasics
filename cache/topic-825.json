How could it be that no one who was supposed to love me ever saw how<br/>\nmuch I hurt? If I can see and know a better way, why did no one do that for<br/>\nme? Yeah I want to give my kids the very best I have to offer, but first I<br/>\nneeded to make some amends with the little girl who felt so cheated, so<br/>\ndeeply unloved. I read somewhere years ago that it&#39;s virtually impossible to<br/>\ngive what we don&#39;t know. That doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t find a way to give it to<br/>\nour kids -- it means that sometimes we first need to give it to ourselves<br/>\nsince no one else did. <br/>\n=================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh holy cow Sylvia!!! I feel the SAME WAY!!! It hurts so much to wonder why<br/>\nmy mom had to treat me so badly growing up. Part of me knows that she was<br/>\nraised the same way, her mother was very cold and controlling. But another<br/>\npart of me sees what was wrong and is determined to raise my child another<br/>\nway. I get angry that she could have done the same thing, not just do what<br/>\nwas done to you because that&#39;s the way life is, but question and do it<br/>\nbetter. You can&#39;t get revenge on your mother by treating your own kids as<br/>\nbadly as you were treated! Where is the logic in that?!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I don&#39;t talk to my mom now but I don&#39;t miss it. I&#39;ve never called her<br/>\nwhen I needed advice or help or anything (like my sister does), but I don&#39;t<br/>\neven call on her birthday or Mother&#39;s Day any more. I just can&#39;t take what<br/>\nshe dishes out and am MUCH happier living without it. Her love (she has a<br/>\nfunny way of showing it anyhow) comes with strings and I finally just cut<br/>\nthem. I tried for years to talk to her about things that happened in my<br/>\nchildhood. I was looking for answers and maybe some closure. She just wanted<br/>\nto sweep it all under the rug and start fresh from that day forward. I just<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t move on because she would not even acknowledge things that had<br/>\nhappened and even tried to convince me some of them did not happen! Finally<br/>\nI realized she had nothing for me and I had to accept that and move on, only<br/>\nit was hard to move on with her still calling me and trying to stay<br/>\nconnected. She just wants to keep some of that control and be able to get<br/>\nher little digs in here and there. It&#39;s so unhealthy, I just can&#39;t allow it<br/>\nanymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I just wanted to relate to what you said about talking with your<br/>\ninner child and letting her know that she is OK. I need to do that. This<br/>\nlittle girl who was me is still hurting and I don&#39;t know how to make it all<br/>\nright. But I am more determined than ever to give to my son what I really<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have! I think by giving it to him, I am also giving a little of that<br/>\nto my inner child as well. Maybe there is some healing going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, part of this lifestyle is unschooling ourselves and our partner<br/>\ntoo. I&#39;m thinking about the person who started this topic or moved it to<br/>\ninclude marriage, you have to keep the same attitude with your spouse you<br/>\nhave with your kids! What does HE need that he is not getting? Ask him. If<br/>\nhe was fine with the way things were, he wouldn&#39;t be the ogre. Try to find<br/>\nways to include him on things. Can you meet him for lunch during the day?<br/>\nMaybe get involved in what he likes to do. Can everyone help out with<br/>\nprojects he&#39;s got going around the house? Could you bring him a beer while<br/>\nhe&#39;s working?! Maybe the kids could read jokes to him while he&#39;s working.<br/>\nWhat about planning a fun family trip? What&#39;s his idea of a good time?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know. I feel gaps too sometimes. I&#39;m trying so hard to be the parent<br/>\nI never had, I&#39;m not the best spouse to have! Life changed dramatically when<br/>\nwe had a baby. We are not as close as we had been for 14 yrs, it&#39;s like a<br/>\nwedge is between us (DS sleeps right between us!). I am also searching for<br/>\nthe elusive Balance. I haven&#39;t achieved it yet but keep working on it. I<br/>\nhave to remember to unschool my hubby more!!!

They were attending a very small rural school, and we were both at home.<br/>\n    My husband, however, is, perhaps like yours, not big on sitting still, which I find is essential for being with kids; you have to move a their pace, and that often means waiting for them to be ready to do whatever...he also did not get that just impulsively yelling at them in the middle of a game to &quot;remember that you have to clean this mess up!&quot; was not useful and did not result in the &quot;mess&quot; being picked up - and as he himself is just about the messiest person in the universe (it&#39;s *other people&#39;s* mess that he can&#39;t tolerate), let&#39;s just say that he lacked &quot;street-cred&quot; on that one.  There are other examples, but you get the idea...<br/>\n    Anyway, things deteriorated over the years since the girls were born - I moved away slowly - we first moved to a house near his in the same rural community, but began going outside that community for things for the girls (the rural paradise had few children my girls&#39; age, and a strong deep prejudice towards &quot;outsiders&quot; as it turned out) - I tried to make a &quot;good divorce&quot;, including him, welcoming him into our house, the girls could go back and forth at will (although they often chose NOT to go to his house much) and they would go on trips with him - we even still went on trips together as a family for those 2 years.<br/>\n    Eventually, it just wasn&#39;t working and the girls and I moved back into town - and he succumbed to pressure from other family members about the girls &quot;doing nothing&quot; and that not going to high school would ruin their lives.  We grow more and more distant and the girls go to his place less and less - another weirdness is that he now has a female housemate, half his age, that is a total control freak and gives the girls a hard time about all kinds of things when they go over there, so they no longer feel that it is their house too.<br/>\n    Anyway, not very encouraging, I know, sorry.  I have also lost the support of my family of origin, who don&#39;t live near us, and after reading some of the recent posts about the sorts of things others go through with family, I am, for the first time, glad of that. <br/>\n    The upshot is that I now realize that I am on my own - and it hurt *a lot* at first, still does some, but not as much as it did, because it is also empowering - I am the youngest in my family, so I have always been a bit of a pleaser and my husband is also pretty domineering - so for the first time in my life really I am actually in charge of my life - and I feel more like a partner to my girls than the one in charge, due to the unschooling philosophy.  <br/>\n    They still go through times when they want to try and please their dad and maybe go back to school, but when the theory turns into reality, they have so far always balked.  They are still going on trips with him, but that&#39;s about the only thing left....<br/>\n    <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Marie <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, June 17, 2008 7:26 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: balance & marriage<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My question would be what to do when your spouse clearly has issues <br/>\n  that are contributing to an unhealthy atmosphere.

Try thinking of more  <br/>\noptions before deciding on a course of action.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, you said you had to put the baby down for a nap. Try to  <br/>\nthink of some other options. Maybe push the baby in a stroller so he/ <br/>\nshe can nap while you walk. Carry the baby in a sling. Delay the  <br/>\nbaby&#39;s nap. Carry baby in a backpack. Instead of a walk, play a game  <br/>\ntogether while the baby is napping. Instead of walking now, walk later  <br/>\nin the evening when it cools off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis lifestyle really does require far more flexibility and creative  <br/>\nthinking than conventional parenting. Most of us had to learn to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith young children, ALL plans are contingent on their state of  <br/>\n&quot;being.&quot; A really good way to avoid frustration is to be clear in your  <br/>\nown head about that. When you start thinking, &quot;We&#39;ll go for a walk,  <br/>\nthe whole family, that will be so sweet,&quot; then stop yourself and  <br/>\nthink, &quot;If it works out, maybe we&#39;ll ....&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour &quot;need&quot; that is really not being met, by the way, is a need to  <br/>\ncontrol.

I can&#39;t leave one in the house by herself at 4yo...most of the time we ended up not going because there didn&#39;t seem to be any other choice.  And if I did succeed in getting them out, I HAD to let go of ANY perconceived idea of what was to transpire - I have also read this about going on walks with children - you have to give up *any* adult expectations of what taking a walk means.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you ever read any Naomi Aldort?  She is wonderful and has an excellent way of helping to uncover what&#39;s going on in one&#39;s mind when feeling frustrated with children.  She has a book out, you can find in on Amazon, can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called, but I really, really think it would help.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith your 5 year old, that just sounds very typical of 5 year olds - and it can be hard as an adult to let go of the idea of what &quot;should&quot; happen and be able to go with the flow - allow the idea that it&#39;s OK that he changes his mind about what he wants to do; allow yourself to let go of the idea that there :should&quot; be a schedule and that things are &quot;bad&quot; if that schedule isn&#39;t met - of course, the hard part for you is not having time to yourself when you can expect it at a certain time everyday - but as you say that may not be fair to the kids, as was the case with your own mother and you - maybe you can find a way to be at rest in  your mind even when with the kids?  I think Naomi Aldort speaks to this kind of idea- it&#39;s also a buddhist notion - to be able to be at peace and at rest in your mind, even all the time - so the external &quot;what is happening&quot; does not dictate what you are feeling on the inside - you are in a peaceful state...it is your &quot;thought&quot; that you can&#39;t get your needs met when you are with your kids that is making this happen - what if your thought was &quot;My needs are being met all the time?&quot; for instance?  anyway, I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t explain it as well as she does - I beg you to go get that book!

I feel really frustrated right now.<br/>\nIt is Father&#39;s day and I was looking forward to hanging out with dh<br/>\nand the 2 kids that are at home (the 3rd is in FL with relatives). Dh<br/>\nsuggested we go for a walk and everyone seemed to want to go. I geared<br/>\nmyself up for it but then my ds5 decided that he didn&#39;t want to go. He<br/>\nwanted to play first. I tried to explain that it wouldn&#39;t work because<br/>\nit would get too hot (middle of day) and that the baby would need a<br/>\nnap around noonish. He locked in. Instead of fight because there was<br/>\nno space to work it out with him. I just had to walk away. Then I was<br/>\njust getting up to go inside and put the baby down for a nap when ds5<br/>\nsays he&#39;s ready for a walk! I explain that it isn&#39;t a good time, I am<br/>\nputting the baby down for a nap. So he is angry about that. Then his<br/>\nfriends come over and he just wants to play with them.
