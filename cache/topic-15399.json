Your own being &quot;out of connection&quot;.<br/>\nSo the real question is, how do you connect with your own heart, your<br/>\nbreath? How do YOU feel connected the whole that is life once again?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the &quot;Mindful Parenting&quot; talk last year, I quoted this from<br/>\n&quot;Wherever You Go There You Are&quot;:<br/>\n&quot;All of Walden Pond is within your breath.  The miracle of the<br/>\nchanging seasons is withing the breath; your parents and your children<br/>\nare within the breath; your body and your mind are within the breath.<br/>\n The breath is the current connecting body and mind, connecting us<br/>\nwith our parents and our children, connecting our body with the outer<br/>\nworld&#39;s body.  It is the current of life.  There are nothing but<br/>\ngolden fish in thsi stream.  All we need to see them clearly is the<br/>\nlens of awareness.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, if I&#39;m feeling out-of-whack, it&#39;s my clue to stop and evaluate<br/>\nwhat is doing that. Am I feeling disconnected from those I love? Am I<br/>\nignoring some area of my life that needs attention?  Do I just need to<br/>\nslow down, be more aware?<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, a simple task like cleaning the kitchen can make me feel<br/>\nbetter. It&#39;s silly, but at an internal level it&#39;s something I can<br/>\ncontrol when life feels uncontrollable. <br/>\nIf cleaning something, or taking a walk, or painting can make you feel<br/>\nbetter, then do it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThese changes are so simple, yet so difficult.  Keep walking towards<br/>\nthe things that bring joy into your life, and all will be well. Pay<br/>\nattention to that which brings you joy...true joy!<br/>\nWhat colors or textures or objects grab your attention...notice them.<br/>\nWhat feels good for your body? Jumping, walking, a warm bath, a cool<br/>\nswim, a hike? Do those things.<br/>\nWhat activities bring you joy? Painting, watching a movie, having<br/>\nfriends over, going to a wine tasting, playing tag, creating a<br/>\nbook....pay attention to the things you love.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think as parents, we get hyperfocused on what our kids need, what<br/>\nour kids &quot;have to&quot; learn, how to keep them healthy and we forget<br/>\nourselves in the process.  But the most effective parents, are<br/>\nfollowing their bliss, with their children right alongside them, both<br/>\nworlds as one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t mean we follow our bliss instead of being present for our<br/>\nchildren, one can be present AND doing the things we love. Your<br/>\nchildren deserve to know the very BEST of you and be invited to join<br/>\nyou in that pursuit of joy.  Let them dabble in and out of your<br/>\nactivities as they grow. Bring in things that help them explore the<br/>\nworld. There is a lovely rhythm and pulse in the family where all<br/>\nmembers are doing that which they love!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15428,"nextTopicId":15429}}
