She still loves to be with her kids and remains creative and open.  I think that our society has a pervasive belief that a lot of learning will be aversive for kids, and it&#39;s just the price that must be paid, like labor pains are part of the price paid for a baby. When I have tried to discuss my kids misery as they tried traditional learning, I hit the wall called, &quot;Well sure they feel that way but it&#39;s best for them, and they don&#39;t understand that because they are kids.&quot; So there is a fear on the part of many that if learning doesn&#39;t involve struggle it is not sufficient. That is a hard fear to address. There is a great essay about that fear in ths book Christian Unschooling, in which that fear is given a body, a will, even its breath is described, and how itr attacks at 4:00 am....but my earnest sitter/friend and her husband would do anything for their kids once they were sure it was best.<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, March 12, 2007 6:09:15 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] fearful spouse/passing judgement<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: acsp2205@yahoo. com<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But if he&#39;s willing to learn more (to have a happy household) why <br/>\nwould he<br/>\nknee-jerk veto?<br/>\nThis family has been through some tough financial and <br/>\nextended-familial<br/>\nchallenges.
