For example, y&#39;know those DIY furniture pieces like nightstands and bookcases? We&#39;ve done many of them over the years. My job is to find the instructions. DH gathers all the pieces and sorts them out, and starts working. If he needs to know something &quot;do I use the 3/8 inch screws or the Â¼ inch screws on this part?&quot; he asks and I check the instructions. On occasion, he&#39;ll ask for the instructions to check the pictures to make sure that he&#39;s got things facing correctly etc. And he&#39;s a voracious reader who learned to read when he was not quite 5 (before he started school) by comparing what he knew a favorite book said and the symbols on the pages, so there&#39;s no lack of reading skills there, just a preference in his wiring for doing and seeing. DS, too, is much more likely to absorb things if there&#39;s something tactile, physical about it - even if the physical activity isn&#39;t exactly necessary for or related to the thing he wants to learn. For instance, he wanted to memorize something way back when he was maybe 5 or so. We tried reading it together, saying it out loud together, not getting through. Then we scattered old throw pillows on the floor - one per word (short phrase). He jumped from pillow to pillow saying the words. He had it memorized in under 10 minutes - he just needed his muscles to be active to connect the words.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to how DS learned to read: he was read to a lot from early on, even if he wasn&#39;t looking at the page - sometimes he was snuggled down just listening and other times he wanted to hear the story AND he wanted to be in motion, or playing with Legos or whatever. There were the ever-popular (lol) fridge magnets with letters on them. We played silly rhyming games (and the rhymes didn&#39;t have to be &quot;real&quot; words even). Lots and lots of verbal stuff. He started recognizing familiar signs Stop, Exit, Burger King, etc. Then when he was not quite 5, he decided that we &quot;had to&quot; get Hooked on Phonics so he could learn to read. We discussed it a bit - it cost money, it would take time to order and ship and get to our house, etc. However, we did have 100 Easy Lessons (another popular program - I bought it on sale half off when DS was a toddler &quot;just in case&quot;) and we could start that right away. He was good with &quot;right away&quot;. Tried the first lesson - just seeing so many words on the page (even though most of it is instruction for the adult/parent/teacher) had him spooked and things went downhill fast. Put that away forever after about 5 minutes or so. Asked him to give me some time to think about it. At bedtime, I pulled out the Bob Books series and explained that they were stories that helped people learn to read (sort of - it was long ago, not sure how that discussion went exactly). He was willing to try. That first night, I read all the books in the first series with him looking on. I think it took maybe 15-20 minutes to read the whole lot. Next night, he read the first book or two and said &quot;I&#39;m a reader!&quot;, then handed me the ones he wanted me to read. Third night we played with them a bit more, picking and choosing which to read and who would read. Then those got boring. So, we started delving into other stuff - sometimes he&#39;d read, sometimes I&#39;d read, sometimes we&#39;d alternate words, sentences, paragraphs, pages. Being &quot;responsible&quot; for an entire book was a bit much for him at that point, but &quot;sharing&quot; the reading was fine - I was the one responsible to read the book, and he&#39;d read whatever bits he wanted to. Along the way, also, we did some silly stuff - for instance, I got really tired of reading a particular book over and over and over and... So, on the umpteenth &quot;read it again&quot;, I turned to the back page and read it from the last letter to the first letter siht ekil (like this). It sounded really funny, DS got the giggles, it occupied a larger portion of my brain and, to draw in the &#39;schoolish&#39; terminology, he got to experience me actually, for real, using word approach skills - working out how the different combinations should sound. Instead of the faked adult &quot;k-ah-tuh&quot; type thing, I was actually having to figure out these &quot;new&quot; words. Anyhow, at that point he could read. And he delved into a variety of stuff at will. Then, once he had mastered that to his satisfaction, he moved on. He *could* read but he didn&#39;t read a lot - mostly he&#39;d read as needed to gather information (where can I find Giratina in Pokemon?) and that was it. Along the way, what I learned was that he had some sort of internally developed &quot;phonics&quot; sorted out. What I saw was things like: he knew the word &quot;water&quot; from various places. Then he came across a book about &quot;weather&quot;. Looks similar...you&#39;ve got &quot;w&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, and &quot;er&quot; but there are other letters and the context didn&#39;t fit. A quick &quot;okay, there&#39;s the &quot;ea&quot; and a &quot;th&quot;, this is how they sound, and this word is &quot;weather&quot;. He went from 3 &quot;blocks&quot; to 5 &quot;blocks&quot; of letter/sound combinations. And they&#39;re not necessarily the standard things you&#39;d find in a phonics book. What&#39;s interesting about it is that he can read quite well without ever having to memorize all those words and sounds and *exceptions*, there are no &quot;exceptions&quot; in his own personal &quot;phonics system&quot;, there are just additional blocks to account for variations in the language. We&#39;ve had discussions over the years about really odd words/pronunciations, why they are that way, where they come from, etc. That&#39;s something I enjoy exploring anyhow so we already had books like &quot;The Mother Tongue: English and how it got that way&quot; (I think that&#39;s the correct title) that explains why you have one kniFe but several kniVes, why on the hoof it&#39;s cattle, on the plate it&#39;s beef, etc. Fast forward some 6 years now (he turned 11 this summer). It&#39;s only in the last 6 to 9 months that he&#39;s actually picked up books as a means of entertainment, not just information. So, there are ebbs and flows to the process as well. Reading would have been a onerous task, devoid of joy and interest, if he was required to read along the way when he wasn&#39;t interested in it as anything but a means of gathering particular types of information. Also, during that interval, he might ask us to find out something for him and we would (I got very good at looking things up in the Pokedex book we have).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn its essence, reading is about matching the symbols to the spoken sounds. Kids learn to speak without &quot;lessons&quot; by being spoken to and having a reason to speak (like getting more cheese). Reading is similarly organic once the constrictions of the school system are removed - the connections happen when a person is ready to match the sounds to the symbols in a manner that makes sense to them. It may not be the same &quot;method&quot; that any other person uses, but it works. And, too, not every person who can read *chooses* to read for entertainment (our old veterinarian mostly reads professional materials, occasionally a biography of a person he is interested in to start with, rarely for general entertainment - he&#39;d rather be out in his fields with his livestock or in the yard with his pet dogs or hiking in the woods for entertainment or talking with friends over a cup of tea).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
