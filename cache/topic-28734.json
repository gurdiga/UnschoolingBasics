Today was her first day back after the Christmas<br/>\nbreak.  She was telling me how her students have no drive nor interest in<br/>\nlearning anything.  She was also telling me how she will force her son not to<br/>\nbe like her students.

I&#39;ve actually felt like this most of my life - trying to &#39;fit&#39; and not fitting at all!  I feel like I&#39;ve finally found my tribe, even though I have yet to meet even one unschooler in person.  I&#39;ve been eyeing with longing the different events so I could meet some of you, but I doubt there is even a possibility of that any time soon.  Firstly, I&#39;m not too anxious to go travelling alone with my 3 year old twin girls, and secondly, my dh still thinks there is nothing wrong with public school, and isn&#39;t currently open to spending any money on anything to do with unschooling.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We just returned from a week at my sister&#39;s house, and my mind is on overdrive about all these issues again.  I thought before we left that I had put all my doubts to rest, but I understand now that this is a work in progress.  I am in huge deschooling mode myself, and likely will be for some time.  I need to cut myself some slack and remember that the first time I read anything/heard anything about unschooling was only about 4 months ago.  Even though everything in me shouted &#39;YES&#39; when I started reading John Holt, I still have a lot of years of experience of school and quite rigid upbringing to let go of.  Again, I thought I&#39;d dealt with most of my past stuff, but in light of doing something so outside the conventional box, there are definitely more layers coming up to work through.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I find myself wishing that Waldorf or something like it felt like &#39;IT&#39; for us, because that would be so easy to explain to relatives.  My sister and her husband are very schooled, both veterenarians, and big believers education being the be all and end all.  We ended up having a discussion about homeschooling (I didn&#39;t even mention the word unschooling since I&#39;m sure you would have felt the shock waves all the way from that one!).  The discussion went okay, I felt pretty confident in what I believe for MY KIDS, and was aware that I wasn&#39;t at all trying to convince them about what to do with their daughter.  So...in my head while we were there I was okay, but then after leaving there my mind has just been going nuts with &#39;is this the right thing&#39;, &#39;are all these unschoolers nuts&#39;, &#39;do I really have the guts to tell people I&#39;m not sending my kids to school AND we&#39;re not planning to follow a curriculum??? and on and on it goes! :o)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Anyway, just had to ramble about all that in the hopes that someone else has been through this process and made it out the other end with their convictions intact.  The night we got home my inbox had 112 emails in it from this group and it did my heart alot of good to be reminded about what we want for our kids...freedom to just BE who they are.  What a gift!!!  I look back on my school years and wish someone had the courage to yank me out of that prison and give me the gift of freedom too.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks for listening, and Happy New Year everyone,<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Mom to Jade and Skye (3)<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron Parham &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:acsp2205@...\">acsp2205@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Stacie, We have been unschooling or deschooling now for 10 months.

If he likes his hair long and is uncomfortable at the idea of having it cut why do you feel a need to dictate his hair length to him? <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever made Simon or Linnaea get haircuts. I gave Simon a horrible haircut once, the bangs kept getting shorter and shorter, but it wasn&#39;t me telling him he needed a haircut, he didn&#39;t like his hair in his eyes. Poor fellow, it was a long time &#39;til his hair made it back to clouding his vision. It is hard to not see your children as a reflection of your parenting and attention. It is hard to walk into a store with a child whose hair looks unkempt, uncared for and not feel as though others will judge you wanting. I know, I have two children who love long hair but only occasionally want it brushed. David has a harder time with it than I do. My real failing is when they are willing to let me brush their hair I get so invested in the idea of getting out every tangle that I don&#39;t listen very well when they ask me to stop. The funny thing is that I have had people comment on how beautiful their hair is on days when all I see are tangles and<br/>\n matted messes. I can remember being the outsider, as well. I can remember going to La Montanita Coop in Albuquerque and seeing these two beautiful children, maybe they were 5 or 6, with visibly tangled hair, ringlets becoming dreadlocks hair, and thinking how wonderful that their parents were able to allow them that freedom. <br/>\n <br/>\nBoth Simon and Linnaea know that how they look may change how people respond to them, but they aren&#39;t particularly worried about it yet. When they are going to something where their lackadaisical approach to grooming may end up costing us somehow, like through customs and immigration or to the U.S. embassy to renew their passports, they are absolutely willing to be combed and curried. But I don&#39;t ask that they humor my fears in that area very often. It is very important to me that I recognize that they are the masters of their own bodies, their own hair and their own appearance. I am happy to give information, but am equally willing to have them choose to come up with their own conclusions about how they want to look.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":313556993,"authorName":"Adrean Clark","from":"Adrean Clark &lt;adrean@...&gt;","profile":"fuzzyellowduck","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: coercing","postDate":"1199591410","msgId":28781,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExOTk1OTE0MTAuRUM0MDVBMEBkaDE2LmRuZ3Iub3JnPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGM3Y2NkNTBjMDgwMTA1MTQwNm42OWQzOWZlOGlhMWVhMzA1MzYwOWU3YTk1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGM3Y2NkNTBjMDgwMTA1MTQwNm42OWQzOWZlOGlhMWVhMzA1MzYwOWU3YTk1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28764,"nextInTopic":28784,"prevInTime":28780,"nextInTime":28782,"topicId":28734,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Because he is four years old and requires my participation in his upkeep. :) ... --Adrean","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1937517241\">Because he is four years old and requires my participation in his <br/>\nupkeep. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 01/05/08 at  2:06 PM you wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  &quot; My youngest has issues with getting his hair cut. &quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;m just wondering why he would have to have his hair cut at all if he<br/>\n&gt;  doesn&#39;t like it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  --<br/>\n&gt;  Joni Zander<br/>\n&gt;  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PhotoCEO@...\">PhotoCEO@...</a><br/>\n&gt;  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ChoosingFreedom@...\">ChoosingFreedom@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Life/Parent Coaching at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://choosingfreedomjoy.blogspot.com\">http://choosingfreedomjoy.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  blogging at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ajoyfuljourney.blogspot.com\">http://ajoyfuljourney.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  website = www.MyCMSite.com/Joni<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n--Adrean </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":299004515,"authorName":"Joni Zander","from":"&quot;Joni Zander&quot; &lt;photoceo@...&gt;","profile":"galavantersjoy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: coercing","postDate":"1199570784","msgId":28760,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM3Y2NkNTBjMDgwMTA1MTQwNm42OWQzOWZlOGlhMWVhMzA1MzYwOWU3YTk1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28753,"nextInTopic":28763,"prevInTime":28759,"nextInTime":28761,"topicId":28734,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" My youngest has issues with getting his hair cut.
