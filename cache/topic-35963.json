I like thinking about how I treat guests who come to  <br/>\nvisit where I live. I LOVE where I live and love to share this part of  <br/>\nthe world with other people. I think about the person and what they&#39;re  <br/>\nlikely to enjoy. I might take some people out to Joshua Tree National  <br/>\nPark and others to Venice Beach or I&#39;ll take some people to the La  <br/>\nBrea Tar Pits and other people to the Getty Center (art museum).   <br/>\nApplying this model to unschooling - I think about my children and  <br/>\n&quot;take them places&quot; that I think will suit them and enhance their  <br/>\nlives. (Not necessarily literally taking them places.) That, to me, is  <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not as crazy about the analogy of guests when it comes to this  <br/>\nparticular topic of household maintenance, not because I don&#39;t think  <br/>\ntreating our kids like honored guests is a good idea (I do), but  <br/>\nbecause it doesn&#39;t seem as good an analogy for helping people  <br/>\nunderstand that we DO care about our kids learning to care for their  <br/>\nliving space and their possessions. When guests come to stay, I try to  <br/>\nhave as nice a situation for them as I can manage - clean sheets,  <br/>\nclean towels, etc. Its nice to do that for my family, too. But, I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t really care how my guests treat their own home or their own  <br/>\nthings. I DO hope that my kids will grow up into adults who take  <br/>\nreasonable care with their things and at least don&#39;t live in squalor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the question is what behavior on my part, now, is most conducive to  <br/>\nliving happily, now, along with encouraging my kids to choose good  <br/>\nhousekeeping over squalor in the future?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people get caught up in focusing on the idea of not requiring the  <br/>\nkids to do chores. That&#39;s like focusing on the idea of not requiring  <br/>\nthe kids to do schoolwork. You can&#39;t understand unschooling by looking  <br/>\nonly at what we don&#39;t do. And, you also have to look at what we do  <br/>\ninstead of requiring housework from our kids. I make housework fun. I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t fake it, I changed MY attitude about it. I didn&#39;t even invite  <br/>\nthe kids to participate until I&#39;d worked on changing my attitude  <br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t want them tainted by my negativity. Sometime along  <br/>\nthe way I &quot;got it&quot; - I now really and truly LOVE to clean up the  <br/>\nhouse, do dishes, do laundry, etc. I mean I truly get pleasure out of  <br/>\nit. And, lo and behold, when I get the Swiffer out and start cleaning  <br/>\nall our hardwood floors, admiring how lovely the wood is and enjoying  <br/>\nthe physical movement and the clean smell, sometimes one of the kids  <br/>\nwill actually take over and want to do it (they&#39;re 17 and 20).  And,  <br/>\nother times, I can say, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m going to dust, want to do it with  <br/>\nme?&quot; and a kid will say, &quot;Sure!&quot; I mean - as if this sounds like FUN  <br/>\nto them.  I stand in the kitchen and rinse dishes and admire the  <br/>\npretty plates and enjoy the warm water. I don&#39;t even say anything to  <br/>\nthe kids, but the good vibes are there and lately I&#39;ve been asking,  <br/>\n&quot;Can somebody unload the dishwasher if you get a chance?&quot; and it has  <br/>\nbeen getting done when I&#39;m not looking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the kids are little, it isn&#39;t hard to make cleaning up fun.  <br/>\nMostly they&#39;ll just jump right in and help if a parent is cheerfully  <br/>\ndoing it with them. It is also really easy to make games out of  <br/>\ncleaning up. I&#39;d suggest doing that when it is happy and cheerful. And  <br/>\nmake it really really easy for kids to put their own stuff away so  <br/>\nthat they CAN do it if they so desire. And when they leave stuff out  <br/>\nthat is &quot;in the way&quot; - meaning either there is so much clutter that  <br/>\nthings are getting buried under other things and it is inconveniencing  <br/>\nother family members or that they&#39;ve left things in walkways or  <br/>\nblocking doorways, then take care of it for them - maybe by putting it  <br/>\naway if they&#39;re done with it or by moving it to a safer place.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I got my own head on straight (one of my dad&#39;s favorite  <br/>\nexpressions &lt;G&gt;) about housework and I was able to do it with  <br/>\nauthentic good cheer, it became easy and natural for me to include the  <br/>\nkids - &quot;Want to help me fold laundry while we watch The Office?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I do NOT have is what some parents think they deserve - kids who  <br/>\ntotally take care of all their own messes and contribute their &quot;share&quot;  <br/>\nto the housework. But I&#39;ve had one move out already and live in her  <br/>\nown little house and - taa daa - she takes good care of it. She even  <br/>\nhas a gorgeous &quot;art room&quot; that most of us would be very envious of -  <br/>\nit is full and brimming with arts and crafts supplies which are all  <br/>\nvery nicely organized so she can find what she wants immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, I&#39;m liking less clutter than we&#39;ve lived with for years.  <br/>\nWith Roya moved out we don&#39;t have the huge amounts of arts and crafts  <br/>\nstuff going on all the time so that whole level of clutter has mostly  <br/>\ndisappeared. But, still, the kids and my husband are more likely to  <br/>\nleave stuff sitting out that piles up into a lot of clutter over a few  <br/>\ndays or week. I&#39;ve started cleaning that all up for them almost every  <br/>\nday - turns out I can do it very quickly. I put away things I know  <br/>\nthey&#39;d want put away and I put other things all into a box - one for  <br/>\neach person and a &quot;not sure who this belongs to&quot;  box. The boxes just  <br/>\nsit out until they decide to put the stuff away, which always happens  <br/>\nsooner or later.  I&#39;m happy to have some clear surfaces around and it  <br/>\nmakes it possible to dust and clean the floors more easily. And, when  <br/>\nthings are a little more cleared up, everybody else is way more likely  <br/>\nto go ahead and clean up after themselves, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently I asked everyone in my family to do two things that I find  <br/>\nmake life easier. They seem sort of small, but they make a difference.  <br/>\nFirst, don&#39;t put anything in the right-hand side of the sink (garbage  <br/>\ndisposal side). When stuff is piled up in the garbage-disposal side of  <br/>\nthe sink, nobody rinses any dishes and the food gets stuck on and it  <br/>\nbecomes kind of a gross, goopey mess. The other thing is not to put  <br/>\nanything down on top of anything else - create a single layer of  <br/>\nclutter only. THAT keeps things from being covered up or buried and  <br/>\nsaves us a lot of time because we don&#39;t have to search for missing  <br/>\nstuff.  It has been about a month or so since I asked this and  <br/>\neverybody has kept it up and I&#39;ve really appreciated it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way this came about was that someone on this list or another one  <br/>\nposted about asking everyone in the family to tell what their own one  <br/>\nor two highest priorities were regarding household maintenance. Nobody  <br/>\nelse in my family seems to have any, but it got ME thinking about what  <br/>\nI&#39;d say I wanted most from the rest of my family and, sort of oddly,  <br/>\nit was those two things. So I asked. They didn&#39;t seem to think it was  <br/>\nmuch to ask.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] clean up","postDate":"1221725750","msgId":35995,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk3QTM3MEU3LTk0OEYtNEI4Qy1CN0I4LUEzMTkyNDZFRUQwM0BtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYwMzE4OC4zODY0Ny5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDYwMzE4OC4zODY0Ny5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35993,"nextInTopic":35996,"prevInTime":35994,"nextInTime":35996,"topicId":35963,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She could  <br/>\ndo it herself, of course, but it was more about doing something  <br/>\ntogether. So she was getting stuff out and reading the directions  <br/>\nwhile I quickly cleaned up the bit of mess in the kitchen. She pretty  <br/>\nmuch made the cookies while we talked and I handed her things. When  <br/>\nthe first batch were in the oven, I started putting cookies on the  <br/>\ncookie sheet for the second batch and SHE moved around the kitchen,  <br/>\nwashing the measuring cups and bowls and utensils we&#39;d used, wiping  <br/>\ncounters, and, yes, even sweeping the floor!

You have staff to do all the rest. I see myself as Simon&#39;s and Linnaea&#39;s and, sometimes, David&#39;s staff. I&#39;m not a tidy cook. I bake a lot and where I stand there usually is a dusting of flour. I get it on my clothes and all over the counter. I don&#39;t worry about it, I don&#39;t actually see it until I am done. If I felt that the clean up was the cost of the creation it might<br/>\n make me resentful of the whole experience. It took me a long time to get to a point where I enjoy cleaning up. A lot of positive thought about doing dishes and seeing it is a reflective moment in a day filled with very few such moments. Given the lifetime it has taken me to un-learn the realm of chore where such jobs were slated in my childhoood why would I want to burden Simon and Linnaea with the same perspective? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I watch Simon&#39;s joy while planning and making a pie, when I watch Linnaea&#39;s pleasure and satisfaction while designing a mashed potato sculpture with brocolli spears for decoration, the mess becomes a much more minor thing to consider. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":66450781,"authorName":"Lisa Russell","from":"Lisa Russell &lt;lisalisarussell@...&gt;","profile":"lisalisarussell","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] clean up","postDate":"1221636980","msgId":35984,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY5Mzg5OS42NTI1Ni5xbUB3ZWIzNzkwMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35983,"nextInTopic":35985,"prevInTime":35983,"nextInTime":35985,"topicId":35963,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for that perspective- I m enjoying the Joyfully Rejoicing site, I love how right on the front page she says Don t drop all your parenting rules at","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-163663950\">Thanks for that perspective- I&#39;m enjoying the &quot;Joyfully Rejoicing&quot; site, I love how right on the front page she says &quot;Don&#39;t drop all your parenting rules at once. Just say &quot;Yes!&quot; more.&quot;    It really shows an appreciation for the process of change involved.  And I like how Sandra Dodd&#39;s page features answers from a few different people.  Thanks so much to whoever shared those.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say, though- the whole dish thing really seems like a non issue in our house.  I made a silent vote to ask the girls what they thought and they all felt the same, (options were &quot;I hate doing dishes, I never want to wash another in my life&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t mind it, it&#39;s no big deal to wash a few dishes every now and then&quot; and &quot;I love dishes and wish there were more to wash&quot;  a girl can dream, right?)  so other than enjoying the perspectives offered on those sites, I&#39;m not really concerned.  I think this all just started when I offered up the different-dish idea for someone else.  I do need new dishes, we break a surprising amount of dishes around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 11 yr old said that if she was really bothered by the no cooking thing, she would have complained about it, she was getting sick of cooking anyways.  She was discouraged because she burned a few things and planned to ask to cook again when she was &quot;over it.&quot;  whatever that means.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents were authoritative, but I&#39;ve never been particularly bothered by it.  I don&#39;t remember ever being really upset by their ways, except thinking my mom was prettier when she was nice, and that my dad was fun when he was in a good mood.  The thing that bothered me the most was being misunderstood.  My husband was really traumatized by his authoritative parents, and he always has a harder time loosening up and believing things don&#39;t need to be managed.   He doesn&#39;t even talk to his siblings, it&#39;s very sad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lisarussell.org\">http://www.lisarussell.org</a>   because .com and .net were taken<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Jodi Bezzola &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jodibezzola@...\">jodibezzola@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 16, 2008 6:59:06 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] clean up<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~I think that not having a clean dish to eat from is a logical consequence for not washing your own dish.

What you&#39;re referring to is punishment - as in, being able to cook being removed because of not cleaning up.  That isn&#39;t a natural consequence, it&#39;s punishment.  I hear &#39;natural/logical consequence&#39; bandied about quite a bit lately - as in, you leave your bike out it might get stolen or rusted...but if I saw my daughter&#39;s bike out in the front yard I would bring it in.  Because it&#39;s only a natural consequence if I didn&#39;t see the bike out in the yard.  Not bringing it in after I saw it laying there makes it anything but natural, it makes it a choice on my part to punish her for leaving her bike out.  Make sense?  Not letting your daughter cook is not helping your relationship with her.

Or fear that you will then be responsible <br/>\nfor washing all the dishes?<br/>\n<br/>\nno- a fear that they&#39;d be helping voluntarily & then change their mind.  Dishes don&#39;t scare me anymore!  Sometimes I&#39;d rather do all the dishes myself, it&#39;s faster, less messy and cleaner.  They really liked having their own special dishes, that&#39;s why I was thinking of doing it again, but the original reason we tried it was definitely based upon tricking them into washing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a bad day- I don&#39;t know- are days really bad?  I said &quot;good day&quot; meaning just that sometimes she&#39;s resourceful like that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hoped that the word &quot;if&quot; would be emphasized in the &quot;if&quot; i were enforcing things like that, which I haven&#39;t been, not only am I a terrible enforcer, but it&#39;s just easier to do it myself, kwim?  Nothing is worth the struggle and fighting anymore, after working 12-18 hour days 7 days a week, missing them like crazy.  I already decided to just do it all myself, but I wasn&#39;t cheerful about it, and my older kids were being super helpful anyways.  They have company a lot, so they&#39;re always straightening things up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed this past week that they do ALL help a lot more than I thought they did, and the cheerfulness I&#39;ve had has had more of an impact on the 7 and 5 yr olds than the older kids.  The older ones (14 and 11) are just plain helpful (I was so cool when they were little, it was all so instinctive)  The 7 & 5 yr old haven&#39;t known me much in their lives, time really has been the best thing for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m reading the links you sent with my husband and older girls tonight.  I don&#39;t want to debate the guest-thing just yet, I wanna work through the links you sent.  It&#39;s really just easier to do it ourselves, and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s where these links will bring me back to, but it&#39;s true, the mindset and the intention behind the words is like- INVISIBLE to me, so pointing it out really helps me examine things.   6 years away from my kids has really done a number on my mommy-brain, and having my husband home with us all now, too has really caused us to examine our childhoods, too.  We were both raised in authorotative homes, his worse than mine.  His mother thinks it&#39;s amazing our kids have survived!  I think it&#39;s amazing that he survived.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway- thanks for tonight&#39;s family read-aloud material, we just finished Emma and now, this.

In the past I&#39;d probably have nagged them to do it, and they would have.  My guess is that if I instituted it today, they&#39;d be competing to see whose dish could be clean more often.  It probably, at the time, was a sneaky way of getting them to take responsibility for their dishes, or at least to make sure that I always had something clean to eat with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, if I were to do it today, probably only one of my kids (7yo) wouldn&#39;t be happy to take care of her own dish.  Then I&#39;d end up doing it for her and the other girls would see that and then stop doing their dishes.  Maybe I&#39;m projecting a fear.  On a good day, she&#39;d exchange something with one of her sisters so that it would be clean, if I were requiring it to be clean.  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d do that today.  I&#39;d have to think about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that not having a clean dish to eat from is a logical consequence for not washing your own dish.
