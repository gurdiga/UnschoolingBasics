Uncomfortable <br/>\naround other people? In what ways? Verbally? Visually? Kinetically? <br/>\nEnergetically? That&#39;s IMPORTANT - more important than whether she falls <br/>\ninto category x or y or xy. Its something *you* need to consider pretty <br/>\nconsistently in your relationship. I&#39;m sure you already know that! but <br/>\nits worth considering specifically wrt your concern that some of her <br/>\nmeltdowns seem to &quot;come out of the blue&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be useful to think about how much human contact, and what kinds <br/>\n(verbal, visual, touch, proximity), your dd has over a period of time - <br/>\na day, five days, two weeks - and see if there is a relationship <br/>\nbetween how much &quot;irritating contact&quot; she gets (for want of a better <br/>\nexpression) and how likely she is to melt down &quot;out of the blue&quot;. This <br/>\nis the sort of thing that&#39;s going to vary a whole bunch from person to <br/>\nperson. Some people build up stress in this way over a loooong period <br/>\nof time if they don&#39;t have a way to discharge it. It makes looking for <br/>\ntriggers confusing bc you only *notice* the last straw, and that keeps <br/>\nchanging - sound familiar?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this does seem to be an issue, you can start looking for ways to <br/>\nhelp your dd have more control over the kinds of contact she <br/>\nexperiences. Probably pulling her out of school in and of itself has <br/>\nhelped her have a whole lot more control in this regard - which could <br/>\nexplain why she&#39;s not nearly as likely to melt down or as severely now <br/>\nthat she&#39;s home. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t stress enough the importance of looking at different *kinds* of <br/>\ncontact/stimulation. It may be that there are ways to be present with <br/>\nher *and* give her the space/control she needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the theories that applies to *some* people with autism is that <br/>\nthey seem to process information via one method at a time - whereas <br/>\nmost other people process via multiple methods simultaneosly. That may <br/>\nbe old news to you, I don&#39;t know - but that&#39;s also a good place to look <br/>\nfor possible &quot;triggers&quot;, especially in light of what I said about build-<br/>\nup over time. If she&#39;s being asked (by circumstances) to process <br/>\ninformation via multiple means too many times in a day (or week, or <br/>\nfortnight!) that could well trigger a meltdown. Too many notes. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 14)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27018,"nextTopicId":26987}}
