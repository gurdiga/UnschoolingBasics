Anecdotal evidence can be useful, but basing an opinion on three people&#39;s experience is shoddy evidence at best.<br/>\nLet&#39;s stick to discussing ideas. If a post offends, or causes ruffled feathers, maybe that&#39;s a time to question why. There may be some deep hurt dredged up, but it isn&#39;t the responsibility of the poster questioning, to know each persons past and issues.<br/>\nRobyn questioned faulty logic.<br/>\nI hope people always do that. I am very positive she meant no hurt feelings, it wasn&#39;t about a person, it was about ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s get back to discussing unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2629,"nextTopicId":2430}}
