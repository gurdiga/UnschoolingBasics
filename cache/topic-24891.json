If DW and I stay up to get<br/>\nthings done, and dd2 is still up, we won&#39;t get anything done.  We&#39;d best<br/>\njust head off to bed.  But I don&#39;t know what would happen if we had the<br/>\nspace to let her be up, and we just went to bed.  Hmmm...<br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell you right now that if DW and I were still up, then having a<br/>\n&quot;quiet time&quot; will not work for dd2.  Even having a designated space would<br/>\nmean zilch if DW and I were still up but in a different part of the house.<br/>\nThey love being with us, and would not stay there (not sure I would want to<br/>\ntry to keep them there, more police action).  What&#39;s more, in many other<br/>\nsituations, dd2 has difficulty modulating her volume.  When she&#39;s loud, we<br/>\ntry to give her ways to be loud while maintaining our own eardrums.  At<br/>\nnight, she will not be quiet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll see.  We&#39;re doing a lot of re-arranging right now, we may be able to<br/>\nset up a quiet area for when they want to stay up later than we do, and a<br/>\nplace that&#39;s still safe with access to us if they want it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Rob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":206058243,"authorName":"Geneva","from":"&quot;Geneva&quot; &lt;gozas@...&gt;","profile":"nevagoza","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"transitioning to no bedtime","postDate":"1183832328","msgId":24891,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24897,"prevInTime":24890,"nextInTime":24892,"topicId":24891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just wanted to add to the discussion that im not sure when ours happened exactly.we have leaned towards the radical since we learned about unschooling over 3","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-868097078\">Just wanted to add to the discussion that im not sure when ours happened<br/>\nexactly.we have leaned towards the radical since we learned about<br/>\nunschooling over 3 yrs ago.
