I battled extreme depression for a long <br/>\ntime. I saw numerous therapists who all focused on my problems and <br/>\nrelationships and I got nowhere. Finally, I lucked on a LCSW who <br/>\ntaught me how to change my negative thoughts to positive ones. It <br/>\nwasn&#39;t about denying my feelings or lying to myself. It was about <br/>\nacknowledging all the good things in my life. I started out very <br/>\nbasic. I had food and shelter. I had clothing. I had a job. I had a <br/>\nfamily. As I got better at it I started to see all the other good <br/>\nthings I had/have. Now I do it automatically and it really does <br/>\nwork.

I think it&#39;s even more important to be able <br/>\nto do this than to get away. What happens if it&#39;s just impossible to <br/>\nget away even for a short time? Do you then have to stay stuck in <br/>\nthe negativity until you can get away? I prefer to find a way out of <br/>\nthe negativity here and now in the moment rather than waiting for <br/>\nsome magical alone time. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was deployed for a year. I was pregnant and had a 3yo who <br/>\nwould not stay with anyone else to care for. I also had a teenager <br/>\nwho kept very different hours from the 3yo. I had my baby halfway <br/>\nthrough my dh&#39;s deployment so then I had a breastfeeding newborn to <br/>\ntake care of as well. There was no way I was going to get away.
