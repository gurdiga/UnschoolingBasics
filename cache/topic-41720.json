Surf around the web site of your state and local education departments to ensure that you fully understand the rules and requirements.**<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, Um...no. I personally would strongly recommend AGAINST this as a FIRST step.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s why. Many state and local education department web sites list steps for homeschoolers that are not required by law, but are instead what the educrats would like to have happen for their own reasons. In Illinois, for instance, most regional district sites request various registration forms, when in fact no such registration is required, and most Illinois statewide groups strongly discourage their members from filing these forms (on the theory that &quot;give them an inch and they&#39;ll take a mile.)This isn&#39;t an unusual situation. In many other states as well, education authority sites will lead one to believe that compliance is much harder than it needs to be legally.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest first step is to check with statewide groups for advice on what others do and have done to comply. They almost always can direct you towards the actual codes so can read the laws for yourself. (It&#39;s sometimes extraordinarily difficult to wade through the school sites and code books without having a friendly guide to point the way.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Registering as a private school","postDate":"1254822356","msgId":41733,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg5M0Q3RENELTA1ODEtNEREMC04NzE4LUUwN0JDRkRFMTQwNkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDkxMjk2Ni4xMTg4NC5xbUB3ZWI1NTgwNC5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGhhZGRmYitiZ29iQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OTEyOTY2LjExODg0LnFtQHdlYjU1ODA0Lm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":41725,"nextInTopic":41734,"prevInTime":41732,"nextInTime":41734,"topicId":41720,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
