Now 9 mths later I still think it is our <br/>\nbest option and Chris is learning and thriving more then he every <br/>\nhas!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI live in the KC Metro area on the Missouri side and I do have a <br/>\nyounger daughter (21 mths younger then Christopher and only 1 grade <br/>\nin school) Courtney who attends Public School.  I know it may seem <br/>\nstrange to have one at home and one who goes to school but this is <br/>\nwhat works best for our family now.  She is a typical pre-teen and <br/>\nmade honor roll last school year and it would drive me CRAZY to have <br/>\nboth of them home!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell thanks for listing to me babble as the fireworks start to die <br/>\ndown around here....I look forward to getting to know everyone and <br/>\npicking your brains!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKaryn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34335,"nextTopicId":34186}}
