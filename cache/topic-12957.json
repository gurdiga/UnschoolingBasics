He had what I&#39;d call very little body  awareness & also <br/>\ndid not talk well then.  I know the original poster  said her dd can speak <br/>\nvery well, but that doesn&#39;t always mean that very young  kids can communicate <br/>\nall that they are feeling.<br/>\nAt that time, we were feeling very overwhelmed ( I also had an infant)  & I <br/>\nliked going to play groups to get out of the house and connect with  other <br/>\nmoms.  It became clear that ds was just not ready for playgroups,  Mommy & Me, <br/>\netc.  Often even one other child was too much for him. So,  we backed off on the <br/>\nplaygroups (that was easy to do after we were asked not to  return to a few, I <br/>\nwas mortified).<br/>\nWe also had to stop going to the library story time and things like that  not <br/>\nonly because he was hitting but he would also RUN away as soon as I started  <br/>\nto pay attention to someone else (like while checking out books- would run <br/>\nright  out the front door of the library if I wasn&#39;t fast enough).<br/>\nIt did of course cut into my SAHM social life, but it was what ds needed at  <br/>\nthat point in time.  Now at 5 3/4 he has friends, goes to the neighbors  house <br/>\nfor the day, etc- very few problems if any.<br/>\nSo, some kids just take longer to figure out all the social stuff.  I  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t force the play groups if she doesn&#39;t seem ready, since it&#39;s obviously  not <br/>\nworking out. Also, if we were invited to friends for dinner who had kids or  <br/>\nsomething like that, we were &quot;always right on top of him&quot; to make sure no one  <br/>\ngot hurt, AND had to be willing to leave in the middle of things if they <br/>\nweren&#39;t  goin well.<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\nAmanda B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12934,"nextTopicId":12951}}
