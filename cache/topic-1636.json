And not just conflicts between been<br/>\nindependent and social, but all sorts of conflicts.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe evolved from creatures that lived alone so it made sense to put self<br/>\nfirst. For instance, it isn&#39;t wrong for a tiger to drive another tiger out<br/>\nof its territory. It&#39;s what makes sense for survival. That&#39;s just what<br/>\ncreatures that live independently need to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when we became creatures that survived better by working together, we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t lose those drives that tells us thinking of ourselves is good for<br/>\nsurvival. We just added another layer on top that told us it makes sense to<br/>\ncooperate and be drawn to forming groups and doing what&#39;s necessary to keep<br/>\nthe group working together.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we&#39;ve naturally got two right but conflicting signals in our heads: Think<br/>\nof self, think of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nModeling helps kids figure out which thoughts will work best for what they<br/>\nwant.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Selfish was Learning -- Rather than Punish","postDate":"1089701059","msgId":1944,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGNjdmxpaittN24yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":1934,"nextInTopic":1948,"prevInTime":1943,"nextInTime":1945,"topicId":1636,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" First","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1323990847\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Let me know why you think people are not born selfish because from <br/>\nwhat I remeber of my Psyc classes, this is what many experts think <br/>\nas well.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all I care just about zip what experts teaching Psyc classes, in an<br/>\nout of context to Unschooling manner, think or express in their classes,<br/>\nwhich are not about Unschooling.

It is sometimes this instinct that causes<br/>\nchildren to behave in odd ways. I also think one of the fundamental<br/>\ninstincts that humans have is to form communities for common good, the most<br/>\nimmediate one being their family. <br/>\n<br/>\nBelow are some definitions that a cursory Google search put out. I cut and<br/>\npasted. There may be others too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieving this kind of thing about a child might make it more difficult to<br/>\nUnschool with joy. We *can* choose our beliefs.

It was Mom&#39;s idea of &quot;how a little girl SHOULD <br/>\ndress.&quot; Laurie happened to like her cowboy boots, jeans and t-<br/>\nshirts. Laurie opened the dress and said, &quot;Eeeewwww that&#39;s so ugly,&quot; <br/>\nand I inwardly cringed. Mom got upset, glared at Laurie and stomped <br/>\nout of the room and said that Laurie was an inconsiderate and <br/>\nungrateful spoiled child. Laurie was hurt by Mom&#39;s words and mean <br/>\nlook. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe had no clue that she had hurt Mom&#39;s feelings and I didn&#39;t feel <br/>\nit was a 2-year old&#39;s place to heal the wounds of a grown woman. All <br/>\nLaurie understood was that her grandmother had made an ugly face at <br/>\nher and called her names. If I had demanded that Laurie apologize, <br/>\nimo I would have been placing my mother&#39;s feelings above Laurie&#39;s. I <br/>\nconsoled Laurie and later told Mom thank you for the dress but that <br/>\ngiving Laurie a gift in order to change who she was didn&#39;t seem like <br/>\na gift at all. 22 years later Mom STILL gets upset when she thinks <br/>\nof that day. She saw/sees nothing wrong with her attitude towards <br/>\nLaurie. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie cringes when she thinks of what she said when she saw that <br/>\ndress, but we both agree it was hideous. As she got older, of course <br/>\nshe learned tact and diplomacy and fakes a smile and says &quot;thank <br/>\nyou&quot; when Mom gives her gifts that go straight to Goodwill. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs parents, we have to put our children first.

We too are in a transition in parenting as <br/>\ndh learns a new way of doing things.  ;)  I have had to handle things <br/>\nthe same way with him when he slipped into old ways of parenting and <br/>\ntotally blows what we have been working so hard on.  This actually <br/>\nhappens often, because dh is a creature of habit (and was an only <br/>\nchild with a disfunctional mother).  Sometimes it is like we are <br/>\nparenting kids and husbands.  lol!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the way you handled this with your dd.  She had to have <br/>\nlearned more from it than from a scolding, or anything else, because <br/>\nit made her think about what she did so SHE can correct the behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis story brings to mind the idea of a parent that punishes a child <br/>\nfor doing something that was also a mistake of the parent. <br/>\nLet me explain:  If dh had gotten angry for a child jumping out of <br/>\ntheir seat into the driver&#39;s seat of the &quot;running&quot; van and something <br/>\nbad happened (or not) because of this action -though the child <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have moved from their seat -dh would have been equally <br/>\nguilty for the happening, because HE was the one that left the van <br/>\nrunning in the first place.  Does that make sense?  Kids will be <br/>\nkids, and I think it is our place to think one step ahead (the what <br/>\nifs) and make sure things are safe.  Like turning off the van when <br/>\nyou get out (and even take the keys with you!).   I actually do this <br/>\ntype of &quot;thinking ahead&quot; all the time and it saves me sooo many <br/>\nheadaches.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Amanda<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kimberly&quot; <br/>\n&lt;Kontessa_Rose@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Merry Meet,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Here in my home we are learning.

Just<br/>\ntrying to see the path is hard when one person in your relationship is<br/>\nlooking in another direction, let alone move along it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to push you a little further....<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did you feel she had to &quot;try and make it better&quot;? I think it is very<br/>\ndangerous to make children feel that they are responsible for an adults<br/>\nfeelings - indeed that anyone is actually responsible for some one else&#39;s<br/>\nfeelings. Be careful that she does not start to believe that she has to keep<br/>\nDaddy happy at the expense of her own selfhood. <br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone has accidents and drops stuff, and I would consider stepping on the<br/>\ngroceries in the realm of an accidental action. If you had dropped the eggs<br/>\nwhile putting them away, would you have had to give dh some gift to make it<br/>\nup? If he had done so, would he have made it up to Crystal and you? I&#39;m<br/>\nguessing not, other than to just say something like &quot;shucks, sorry honey&quot;.<br/>\nBTW I always put the groceries in the trunk - Jayn has a tendency just to<br/>\nstep on whatever is in her way also.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you done much reading on the concept of &quot;Principles instead of Rules&quot;?<br/>\nThe idea is that the Principles that we live by apply to all members of the<br/>\nfamily, and each member lives up to them as much as they are developmentally<br/>\nable. One of the principles we have is &quot;Safety First&quot;. In recovery Spiritual<br/>\nPrinciples are expressed as single words or short phrases, the opposite of<br/>\nCharacter Defects. Examples are Kindness, Honesty, Thoughtfulness of others,<br/>\nJoyfulness. Other people have other ways of expressing them. These are the<br/>\nblueprint or map of the path that is the alternative to punishing and<br/>\nshaming. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour dh would get so much out of Ben Lovejoy&#39;s conference workshop on this<br/>\nissue. Also Ben is a former military man, so if anyone could empathize with<br/>\nhis journey it would be Ben. Gosh I wish you could swing being there!<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
