What made you start <br/>\n&gt; &quot;schooling-at-home&quot; again?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well... there were many reasons really.  My kids were enrolled in an<br/>\nonline homeschooling program which I worked for at the time, and I<br/>\n(and they) felt loyal to it and didn&#39;t want to unenroll which would<br/>\nmean a lot of creative finagling if they were unschooling.  My kids<br/>\nhave always loved learning, and haven&#39;t become angry and jaded to it<br/>\nlike many kids who begin unschooling.  I figured we must be doing just<br/>\nfine since they still spent most of the day learning other stuff, and<br/>\nwere not turned off to schoolish stuff, and overall my relationship<br/>\nwith them was great.  The job I was in was exhausting.  I would get<br/>\nwrapped up in it and my own stuff and not spend time doing things with<br/>\nthe kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat didn&#39;t work about homeschooling, though, is what has brought me<br/>\nback.  And it has more to do with relationship and parenting stuff<br/>\nthan education stuff.  I have always believed in parenting as<br/>\nnon-coercively as possible.  I respect my kids immensely, and treat<br/>\nthem as autonomous intelligent people.  We&#39;ve never limited games, tv,<br/>\netc. and never had set bedtimes.  The things we do enforce, though,<br/>\nare the things that are bothering me.  Chores... this is my husband&#39;s<br/>\nbig thing, which I can&#39;t really control anyway.  The chores they do<br/>\nare tied to their allowance.  They actually are fine with it usually,<br/>\nbut my husband is extremely demanding about it (i.e., do it right this<br/>\nsecond).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 y.o. is very stingy with his younger brother (8).  8 y.o. will<br/>\nshare and do anything for 12 y.o., but it is not reciprocated at all.<br/>\n This really bothers me.  I make him share sometimes, and I&#39;m sure<br/>\nthat has contributed.  I remember my 17 y.o. being similar with the 12<br/>\ny.o. when they were younger, but he outgrew it.  Still, it really gets<br/>\nunder my skin and I don&#39;t know if I should stay out of it or what.  An<br/>\nexample would be, they both play Teen Second Life.  12 y.o. will get<br/>\nsome cool item which he could copy and give a copy to 8 y.o. with no<br/>\nloss for himself but refuses to do it when asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 y.o. was doing algebra, and would constantly go around saying,<br/>\n&quot;I hate math&quot;, which bothers me.  Especially since he&#39;s really good at<br/>\nit.  What&#39;s the point of making a 12 y.o. learn Algebra just because<br/>\nhe&#39;s ready for it... if he wants to learn it in college he has plenty<br/>\nof time for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe time factor... it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to spend the time. It&#39;s<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t necessarily trust myself to do it.  For homeschooling, I<br/>\nspent a few hours on the weekend planning and maybe a couple hours a<br/>\nday actively working with the kids.  A lot of the planning was done<br/>\nfor me by the program we were using, and some of the work they could<br/>\ndo independently (especially the 12 y.o.).  That was about all the<br/>\non-time I had with the kids during the week, except for the occasional<br/>\nWOW session, book reading, tv show or outing.  I get bored/distracted<br/>\neasily, there are few video games I enjoy, and when I&#39;m reading<br/>\nsomething (online or off) I am good at ignoring everything around me.<br/>\n  It is hard for me to remain focused with them unless we are doing<br/>\nsomething I enjoy.  But I think I was using the school time as<br/>\nrationale for not spending other on-time with them.  At least I would<br/>\nget in that requirement each day and that would count for something.<br/>\nNot to mention the taekwondo, gymnastics, scouts (cub and boy),<br/>\nvolunteering at the humane society...  I don&#39;t want school work to be<br/>\nmy only on-time with my kids.  But I don&#39;t want the lack of schoolwork<br/>\nto allow me to not have that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there&#39;s my weaknesses, and failings, and fears.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Q~<br/>\naka Sarah</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: I&#39;m back...","postDate":"1203521839","msgId":30091,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZwaGhmZitnZTVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZwZnBjdCs2ODJ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30088,"nextInTopic":30092,"prevInTime":30090,"nextInTime":30092,"topicId":30055,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello Queana, nice to see you again. :-) ... like I do, in non-coercive parenting, I can t find women whose wisdom and words I respect like those here (and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-134956286\">Hello Queana, nice to see you again. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I can&#39;t find a community of parents anywhere else that believes, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>like I do, in non-coercive parenting, I can&#39;t find women whose <br/>\nwisdom and words I respect like those here (and other unschooling <br/>\ngroups).

I was around a couple years ago when I<br/>\nunschooled for like 5 months, but then decided not to continue and<br/>\nquit posting.  Well... I can&#39;t let it go.  The unschooling, that is. <br/>\nI can&#39;t find a community of parents anywhere else that believes, like<br/>\nI do, in non-coercive parenting, I can&#39;t find women whose wisdom and<br/>\nwords I respect like those here (and other unschooling groups).  I<br/>\njust can&#39;t.  I know that this is right for us, but am quite... nervous.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNevertheless, I told the kids today that I would not be requiring any<br/>\nmore schoolwork from them, that they know a lot already and most of it<br/>\nhas been learned outside of school or school work, and that I knew<br/>\nthey could learn what and when they wanted or needed to.  They acted<br/>\nlike it was Christmas.  Well, the 8 y.o. did.  The 12 y.o. was like,<br/>\ndidn&#39;t we try this before and it failed miserably?  No, I said. Last<br/>\ntime we ended the school year early (2 months early) and so had an<br/>\nextra long summer vacation, and then started up again the following<br/>\nyear.  This time we are just quitting with the mandated schoolwork.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want them to think it is temporary because that will defeat the<br/>\npurpose, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, now I am nervous... because I am afraid I will get too<br/>\nabsorbed in work, or other stuff and not focus enough time on them. <br/>\nThat has always been my rationale for not unschooling - unschooling<br/>\ntakes too much time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what I&#39;m looking for here... thoughts?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29636,"nextTopicId":30095}}
