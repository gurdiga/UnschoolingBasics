What you&#39;ll find on *this* list is really *just* unschooling. \nWe&#39;re not really sure how one could combine Unschooling with Waldorf and Classic \nHomeschooling. Unschooling is about trusting the child to learn what she needs \nwhen she needs it. Waldorf and &quot;school-at-home&quot; will work against that \nphilosophy. </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:blue 2px solid;\"><font\n style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;\" face=\"Arial\" color=\"#000000\" size=\"2\">\n  <div>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My 7 year old has some special needs (Aspergers) so \n  thruthfully I am not sure what is going to work with her and what \n  isn&#39;t.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</div></font></blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>You might want to log on to <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.unschooling.com/\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/\">www.unschooling.com</a> and read the message \nboards. One of the esteemed regular posters there is Anne Ohman (AnneO). Anne \nhas a child with Aspergers and posts regulary about his unique qualities---he&#39;s \nwhat brought her to unschooling. I have spent four weekends over the last two \nyears&nbsp;with Jacob, and he&#39;s absolutely delightful. I&#39;m sure that, if Anne \nhad imposed all the rules and regulations and----especially school on \nJacob,&nbsp;he would have been crushed. Instead, she and Dave have honored him \n(and his brother Sam) for Who He Is (as she puts it). </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Anne is a gentle soul who believes that children can and will Shine if \nallowed to be Who They Are. LOTS of worthy reading there. </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>I&#39;d keep an eye out for Mary (Life is Good) &quot;Zenmomma&quot; Gold.
