Because it is horribly inconvenient.  &quot;letting&quot; a child choose, how could you think <br/>\nit?!? They would never make the right decisions.  They would never be able to choose right <br/>\nfrom wrong and letting them stay up as late as they want and sleep in late does nothing <br/>\nbut cause frustration for &quot;we&quot; the parents because we Must get up early and having to wait <br/>\nfor a child to do what they &quot;think&quot; they &quot;need&quot; to do is ridculous!  We are the parents and <br/>\nthe children must learn to do what we think is best.   etc etc etc**<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so glad we unschool.  I don&#39;t mind if they sleep in!  They are happy, healthy, get <br/>\nenough food and water.  They may need to get up early for special things (such as their <br/>\ngrandparents are coming or we have to travel someplace)....but they can choose not to get <br/>\nup or to sleep in the van.  Why have a child go to bed right in the middle of big thoughts <br/>\nor designs when they are on a roll.  I don&#39;t think Thomas Edison would have done that.  He <br/>\nwould have kept working.....not even realizing the time.  I am sure his lab workers had to <br/>\nremind him what day it was too.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nI was really surprised by the hatred with which people responded.  Hatred toward <br/>\nhomeschool and unschool &quot;Freaks&quot; that we the parents are creating.  Hatred toward people <br/>\nwho tend toward a more European lifestyle.  I can understand that the author didn&#39;t seem <br/>\nto be putting their child first, but still.  I don&#39;t think those who replied needed to be so hot <br/>\nheaded and heavy handed in their replies.  Most replies were unintelligent or guilt-ridden.  <br/>\nI am sure from the replies that many of them have treated their children with disrespect <br/>\nand forced everything.
