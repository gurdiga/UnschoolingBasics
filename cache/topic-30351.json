My children have been in the car as we drove downtown on <br/>\njust a few occassions, but have never had the opportunity to actually <br/>\nexperience the buildings except just looking out the window.  So, I <br/>\nfound a parking meter (boy, that parking meter was an event all by <br/>\nitself!) and began our adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we wandered around looking way up, up, up, at the buildings, we <br/>\nstarted noticing a lot of animals used in the architecture.  We saw, <br/>\namong other things, snake, mouse, rooster, lions, and eagles.  Dd <br/>\nsuggested that next month when we come downtown to see the next <br/>\nchildren&#39;s production, we take our camera and take pictures of the <br/>\nanimals and then make a book or album page about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had another idea:  Wouldn&#39;t it be neat if others took pictures of <br/>\nanimals in architecture and we could post them in the photo section, <br/>\nor email them to each other.  Then we would have animals in <br/>\narchitecture from all over!  Just an idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we have a building called the Atlas Building.  At the very top <br/>\nis a statue of Atlas holding the world on his shoulders.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nremember much of the story about Atlas, but I told the children what <br/>\nI knew.  They want to know more, so I&#39;ve ordered books from the <br/>\nlibrary and we are anxiously awaiting their arrival to our local <br/>\nlibrary.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it interesting that architecture can be an adventure leading to <br/>\nall sorts of possibilities?  Also, parking meters!<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30461,"nextTopicId":30542}}
