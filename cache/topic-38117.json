She&#39;s also taking an Art calss at a local studio.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I picked her up last night she gave me a hard time because they <br/>\nare offerering Algebra and why didn&#39;t I sign her up for that.  I was <br/>\njoking with her that she is giving me grief for not &quot;letting&quot; her <br/>\ntake math.  I turned to the director and asked if there&#39;s space in <br/>\nthe class and there is so no problem she can take Algebra.

Anyone send their kids there?  There s one near me,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-995755314\">Hello, all! :-)<br/>\n <br/>\nWas wondering if any on this list had any experience with Sudbury<br/>\nValley-model schools?  Anyone send their kids there?  There&#39;s one near<br/>\nme, Fairhaven, in Upper Marlboro.  I just went to the open house today,<br/>\nout of curiosity and as a just-in-case (in case girls want to go to<br/>\nschool or some other thing happens).  Cool school!  I know there are<br/>\npros and cons either way and we are happy unschoolers as I write this.<br/>\n:-)  <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Melissa :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38137,"nextTopicId":37731}}
