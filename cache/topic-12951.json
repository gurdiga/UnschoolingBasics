Sounds like  <br/>\nshe&#39;s a &quot;resister&quot; -- good for her. It is a challenge to your husband  <br/>\nto find other ways of being with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWHILE figuring that out, if I was him, I wouldn&#39;t let her hit me at  <br/>\nall. He should probably just remove himself from the situation the  <br/>\nminute she hits - hitting ends the game, hitting ends the activity,  <br/>\nwhatever it is. He could very gently and kindly get up and walk a few  <br/>\nsteps away.  Something simple like that - interrupt the flow. I think  <br/>\nwhen a kid is being physically aggressive TO another person, even a  <br/>\nparent, it is good to put some space between you - to stop the  <br/>\nphysicality right away, before engaging with words. You can move  <br/>\nright back with a hug - but I don&#39;t think it is a good idea to just  <br/>\nsit there and &quot;take it&quot; while trying to communicate with words.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":133126509,"authorName":"Amie","from":"&quot;Amie&quot; &lt;amiersa2@...&gt;","profile":"mascire2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Help-dd is a hitter","postDate":"1147283142","msgId":12951,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjEwMWM2NzQ1OSQ4ZjQ1OTA1MCQ2NjAxYThjMEBMYXB0b3A+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12963,"prevInTime":12950,"nextInTime":12952,"topicId":12951,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I haven t posted on here before, but I wanted to jump in on this thread.

I agree with the person who said that your DD might not be ready for playgroups. In my experience, kids that are hitting other kids are feeling anxious about the situation. A book I would recommend is Magical Parent; Magical Child. The author states that kids really don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; playmates until around age 7, I think. I believe that same age playgroups are about the same as same age classrooms-ii is unnatural. This is probably why your DD is ok in a group of older children. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as hitting your DH, I would tend to think that she is angry with him. I would try to discover why this is. Did she agree to have him finish brushing her teeth?Maybe she felt she didn&#39;t have a choice, so her way of letting him know was to hit him? I would help her with feeling words to describe what is going on. Alot of observation on your part will probably help too. Personally, I would stop the playdates with same age kids, and try to get your need for adult stimulation met in another way for awhile. <br/>\n<br/>\nhope this helps,<br/>\nAmie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12957,"nextTopicId":12899}}
