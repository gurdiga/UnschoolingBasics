I do know, though, that the people I tend to hang out with, the <br/>\nones I put effort into getting to know better and spend time <br/>\nwith---those people are almost always more intelligent than I am. It&#39;s <br/>\njust more fun to be around smart people! They keep me hoppin&#39;! &lt;g&gt; and <br/>\nthinkin&#39;!

You can never be 100% positive the other <br/>\nperson is getting it at the same level *you* are---no matter what you <br/>\nsay.

We <br/>\napologize. We learn from them. We try to do better the next time. We DO <br/>\nbetter the next time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;re all learning. Some learn faster than others. Some get it even <br/>\nbefore having children (amazing! &lt;g&gt;). Others of us follow the crowd <br/>\nfor years before finding a new path. It&#39;s different for each of us. But <br/>\nnone of us were raised with this philosophy: we all had to figure it <br/>\nout ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n Patience. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to learn. It&#39;s just that I feel<br/>\n extremely overwhelmed.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  I understand.
