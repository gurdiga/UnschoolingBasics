Maybe This American Life.  Anyway, they<br/>\nwere talking about how 80% is seen by schools as being a C grade (or at best<br/>\na B).  Yet statistically 80% is a miracle.  If something happens 80% of the<br/>\ntime it is almost phenomenal.  For instance if 80% of every kind of seed<br/>\nwere to germinate and make another plant it would be miraculous.  If people<br/>\nwere compassionate 80% of the time it woudl be miraculous.  If people were<br/>\nhappy 80% of the time it woudl be miraculous.  Yet, we view someone who only<br/>\nknows 80% of a test&#39;s questions as being &quot;just average.&quot;  Statistically<br/>\nanything over 40% is phenomenal!  I just found it odd how nature&#39;s 80% is<br/>\nfantastic and school&#39;s 80% is not.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12136,"nextTopicId":12076}}
