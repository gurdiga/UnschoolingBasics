In my<br/>\n  transition to RU, I have been trying very hard to say yes to ds9¹s requests<br/>\n  and to meet his needs _and wants_. DH is following my path to RU from a<br/>\n  distance and at a slower rate. Based on ds9¹s request, we have recently<br/>\n  purchased a game system (used xbox), ds has used his money to purchase an<br/>\n  ipod and songs, we are buying the food he asks for (that no one else eats),<br/>\n  and we are trying our best to give him free choice in every way.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So what¹s the problem? Now he wants an electric scooter/ride on toy. He has<br/>\n  talked himself into wanting a $470 model (up from 2 days ago when he wanted<br/>\n  a $200 electric scooter like one he used on a trip last week). He says we<br/>\n  have plenty of $$ and he should be able to get it this week. I spent an<br/>\n  entire day going over our family finances (again) with him, talking about<br/>\n  how we have to build our savings back up because we just paid cash for a<br/>\n  car, we need to save the $ for going to L&L (which he begged to do), etc. We<br/>\n  have been talking for months about budgets, cash flow (he has his own bank<br/>\n  account with ATM and uses quicken to track expenses), saving up for things<br/>\n  like the taxes on our house, etc. He is still stuck on the amount of $<br/>\n  flowing in and says he should get the scooter without having to wait. He is<br/>\n  willing to pay $40 towards the scooter.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We have in the past purchased things that were pricier than we would have<br/>\n  liked when we felt the money would be well spent. He has 3 bikes (one is a<br/>\n  racing bike since he is a bike racer and he can go faster than this electric<br/>\n  scooter!). He has nowhere to ride this scooter besides our driveway and our<br/>\n  small neighborhood road. My husband is having big problems with laying out<br/>\n  that much cash for something he sees no value in, anticipates very little<br/>\n  use of, and has not been a desire very long. He sees many adults who behave<br/>\n  in the same way wrt $$ and regards them as not being financially stable in<br/>\n  the long term.<br/>\n<br/>\n  DS earned $ last month mowing a friend¹s lawn and put that $ towards his<br/>\n  ipod. He saved and contributed to the racing bike last year because he<br/>\n  really wanted that one versus a less expensive model. Saving for big things<br/>\n  is not foreign for him. He was very proud of himself and his ability to save<br/>\n  for something really important when he paid for his bike and his ipod.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There is a lot of tension in our house right now. Any ideas how to release<br/>\n  some tension and come to some agreement?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ciao,<br/>\n  Zoa<br/>\n  ----------------<br/>\n  Zoa Conner, PhD<br/>\n  Physicist and Organic Learning Mother<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zoaconner@...\">zoaconner@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151505017,"authorName":"carenkh","from":"&quot;carenkh&quot; &lt;carenkh@...&gt;","profile":"carenkh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Saying yes, money, and lots of stuff","postDate":"1212587998","msgId":33475,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcyNjc0dSs0aGloQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEM0NkMwQzcwLkNFRUMlem9hY29ubmVyQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":33471,"nextInTopic":33481,"prevInTime":33474,"nextInTime":33476,"topicId":33471,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If it were $470 for something you valued, would the money be there?
