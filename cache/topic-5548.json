I have stood back and we had a discussion about getting another computer.  They were not in favour cos the games they use they all use and would still have to take turns unless I buy more of the same games. I still think that is a better idea tho so I will look into it.  I feel burnt out and I shouldn&#39;t. Stuff has definitely gone wrong.  I think I have tried too hard to direct them after the LEA visit and I shouldn&#39;t.  I trusted them up to then and nothing changed really. They have had times in the past of doing what appears very little.  It was me who lost confidence not them. I asked them all if they are happy with their unschooling lives - if they feel fulfilled and content they are learning what they need and they all without exception said yes. They also felt I had changed and that had confusd them and caused them stress.. So I said sorry. That is 7 happy kids and that is what counts to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nruth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] After 4 years things are going wrong","postDate":"1117693518","msgId":5553,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY4MjQ5Y2ZhNWM0Yzk2MTY4OWY4YTU2MTBmNzk0ZmY5QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGEwZmQwMDk4ODdhYWY2YmNkMmFiNDhhMzBjMjhhYjk1QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDQwMWM1NjZkMyRmZDY0ZWUzMCRjZmU4ZjlkNUBwY2FiYTFkMzU1NTE5Zj4gPDI3M2Y0YTQ0ZGQ0MTZhYzEyNzA0YWYzNjMyZmJkMDhiQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+IDwwMDFjMDFjNTY2ZTUkOTVkMWRkNzAkY2ZlOGY5ZDVAcGNhYmExZDM1NTUxOWY+IDxhMGZkMDA5ODg3YWFmNmJjZDJhYjQ4YTMwYzI4YWI5NUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":5552,"nextInTopic":5565,"prevInTime":5552,"nextInTime":5554,"topicId":5548,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I am not *that* bothered they play Sims and watch T.V  and, as you say in the midst of all the other possibilities it must be serving a purpose. Just cos I don&#39;t like it doesn&#39;t mean it is not important to them.  Also the teen thing and to gearing up to college e.t.c doesn&#39;t bother me either. My kids all have AS and tbh I don&#39;t want them to  grow up fast. I like the fact they still play and are children.  We recently had a huge battle with our education authority over the children&#39;s education. The inspector was not happy with the &quot;lack of evidence&quot; of &quot;work&quot; and  wanted third party testing of my two youngest which I refused and had to go and see a senior officer over.  That has shock me up.  It was 6 months of stress and worry.  When you asked me what I was bothered about that came to mind straightaway so thanks for saying that.  I am now thinking maybe they have picked up on it all.
