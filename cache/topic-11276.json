Some states you simply<br/>\nnotify the school district of your intent to homeschool and you never need<br/>\ndo anything ever again.  While other states have more stringent<br/>\nrequirements.  It is important to know what your state requirements are.  I<br/>\nhave found it very interesting that when some parents have notified their<br/>\ndistricts of intent to homeschool the local district will make homeschooling<br/>\nsound like it is difficult with tons of hoops to jump through and lots of<br/>\nrequirements.  Yet, none of these hoops are required by the state.  It&#39;s a<br/>\n&quot;scare tactic&quot; to make parents think it would be just easier to keep their<br/>\nchild in the school system.  Or they are made up by a school district<br/>\nemployee who doesn&#39;t know the state laws.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are living in a state that has lots of requirements, the best thing<br/>\nto do is to look for an unschooling group in your state.  I bet most of the<br/>\nstates have a  &quot;Your state Unschooling&quot; yahoogroup.  These families are<br/>\nmasters at how to word unschooling lifestyles into schoolish looking<br/>\njargon.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nCatch our new wave of color!<br/>\nBook a March show!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175041842,"authorName":"hecares4uall","from":"&quot;hecares4uall&quot; &lt;hecares4uall@...&gt;","profile":"hecares4uall","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"7"},"subject":"Question: How do you handle unschooling w/ the school district?","postDate":"1144041459","msgId":11276,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUwcWI1aitpcjJoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11277,"prevInTime":11275,"nextInTime":11277,"topicId":11276,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A newbie!
