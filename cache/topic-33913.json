My focus back then was secondary education, so the requirements were different than elementary. More focus was put into your &quot;specialty&quot; than the actual education. My roommate was elementary ed, and the ed classes she had to take and requirements were so much more than mine. Hers was a major, mine was a minor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just feel perplexed in trying to summarize what we know as &quot;daily life&quot; into something suitable and minimal to please a bunch of people that don&#39;t KNOW us for them to nod and smile that we can continue on our merry way.

It was so non-descript, didn&#39;t mention my childrens&#39; names that they even want this for, nor did it even specify that they want two reports.

I always sent my LOI in by the last week of August, before school started. But, I can tell you, they WON&#39;T be getting it by then. I just received this letter YESTERDAY, June 21, and the letter itself is dated June 10. Seriously, it doesn&#39;t take mail 10 days to go across town. I&#39;ve sent a letter across the COUNTRY in less time. And I send all my mail to them certified, return receipt. It gets there, if not the next day, the day after. The postmark on the envelope is June 19th, so they&#39;ve had this sitting in their office almost 10 days.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy LOI does specify a progress report, but since they haven&#39;t bugged me in the past three years, I&#39;ve never bothered with one. I specifically have it in my LOI that I will submit one ON written request. They never requested, I never put one together. Now I have to, and am clueless as to what I should include lol. I&#39;d really like to deal with them as little as possible, and give them JUST enough to satisfy them and not too much to make them qant/demand more. I do just enough to stay in the legal bounds with them, and that is that. <br/>\n~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Wendy in Chelmsford <br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>~~~~~~<br/>\n*waves*<br/>\nHi Wendy!

My name is<br/>\nJenny, I live in MA with my 3 children, wonderful husband, 4 cats and<br/>\n1 wiener dog.  I&#39;ve always wanted to homeschool, ever since I was in<br/>\ncollege and attempted to become a teacher. At the same time MA decided<br/>\nto formulate MCAS testing and new teacher certs. I dropped out. I<br/>\nwanted NO part in that malarcky. Before we needed to &quot;legally&quot; report<br/>\nto the school district, we dabbled in a few different &quot;curriculum&quot;<br/>\nideas, but I just couldn&#39;t see &quot;disciplining&quot; myself to force my<br/>\nchildren to sit at the table and DO busy work. I so enjoyed watching<br/>\nthem play, doing things, watching that &quot;light bulb&quot; moment when they<br/>\nmastered something. So, I found unschooling, and MY light bulb went<br/>\noff. :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, we aren&#39;t radical unschoolers, although I&#39;d love to be. We just<br/>\naren&#39;t there quite yet, but working on it day by day. But we have been<br/>\ndoing &quot;nothing&quot;, as the school would view it. Of course, we are doing<br/>\nTONS. I&#39;m currently listening to my older two in the kitchen, the Risk<br/>\nboard all spread out, making up their own worldly adventure. My<br/>\nyoungest is drawing behind me, making a &quot;book&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, here&#39;s my &quot;panic&quot; moment. In the past two years of having to<br/>\nreport our intent to the school district, they&#39;ve left us alone. Send<br/>\nin my letter stating I&#39;m homeschooling, and that&#39;s all. Done. Well,<br/>\nthis year, there&#39;s been a lot of changes within the (messed up) school<br/>\ndepartment, and I have received a letter from them, requesting<br/>\n&quot;coppies or your assessments for the end of the school year&quot;. It goes<br/>\non to say, &quot;As you may recall end of year assessments to document<br/>\nacademic growth are required as part of the home school agreement.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ACK!!!!!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have to have this in by July 1, according to them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, HOW do I write up a simple &quot;assessment&quot; of the past year? I have<br/>\nto do two, one for my son, one for my daughter. UGH. I hate going to<br/>\nthe &quot;academic&quot; frame of mind. My son is FINE in that thinking. He&#39;s 8<br/>\nand has been reading for about 2 years, maybe more. He, I can&#39;t even<br/>\nreally put into words what he knows that he &quot;should&quot;, nor do I really<br/>\nknow what THEY think he should know. And I know they&#39;d chew up my<br/>\ndaughter and spit her out, she&#39;s JUST barely beginning to read, BUT,<br/>\nshe&#39;s in speech therapy and I truly believe that is the focus with<br/>\nher. She&#39;s had such a rough time mastering language the way SHE wants.<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t think the school needs to know about that.

My name is Jenny, I live in MA with my 3 children, wonderful husband, 4 cats and 1 wiener dog.  I&#39;ve always wanted to homeschool, ever since I was in college and attempted to become a teacher. At the same time MA decided to formulate MCAS testing and new teacher certs. I dropped out. I wanted NO part in that malarcky. Before we needed to &quot;legally&quot; report to the school district, we dabbled in a few different &quot;curriculum&quot; ideas, but I just couldn&#39;t see &quot;disciplining&quot; myself to force my children to sit at the table and DO busy work. I so enjoyed watching them play, doing things, watching that &quot;light bulb&quot; moment when they mastered something. So, I found unschooling, and MY light bulb went off. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, we aren&#39;t radical unschoolers, although I&#39;d love to be. We just aren&#39;t there quite yet, but working on it day by day. But we have been doing &quot;nothing&quot;, as the school would view it. Of course, we are doing TONS. I&#39;m currently listening to my older two in the kitchen, the Risk board all spread out, making up their own worldly adventure. My youngest is drawing behind me, making a &quot;book&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, here&#39;s my &quot;panic&quot; moment. In the past two years of having to report our intent to the school district, they&#39;ve left us alone. Send in my letter stating I&#39;m homeschooling, and that&#39;s all. Done. Well, this year, there&#39;s been a lot of changes within the (messed up) school department, and I have received a letter from them, requesting &quot;coppies or your assessments for the end of the school year&quot;. It goes on to say, &quot;As you may recall end of year assessments to document academic growth are required as part of the home school agreement.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nACK!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to have this in by July 1, according to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, HOW do I write up a simple &quot;assessment&quot; of the past year? I have to do two, one for my son, one for my daughter. UGH. I hate going to the &quot;academic&quot; frame of mind. My son is FINE in that thinking. He&#39;s 8 and has been reading for about 2 years, maybe more. He, I can&#39;t even really put into words what he knows that he &quot;should&quot;, nor do I really know what THEY think he should know. And I know they&#39;d chew up my daughter and spit her out, she&#39;s JUST barely beginning to read, BUT, she&#39;s in speech therapy and I truly believe that is the focus with her. She&#39;s had such a rough time mastering language the way SHE wants. And I don&#39;t think the school needs to know about that. We deal with her needs via her therapist and her pediatrician. I&#39;m just stressed about how I&#39;m going to come up with something written that is simple, and will satisfy them to leave us alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nHELP!!!! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nJenny<br/>\nMom to Danny (8), Kelsey (6) and Evelyn (4)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33904,"nextTopicId":33882}}
