Unschoolers help their kids  <br/>\nexplore what interests them. They run interesting things through  <br/>\ntheir lives so that they have access to new interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Educational&quot; usually means someone has pulled out all the  <br/>\n&quot;important&quot; facts and presented them for memorization.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers are more interested in helping their kids make  <br/>\ndiscoveries about the world. The don&#39;t need to be -- and usually  <br/>\nwon&#39;t be -- &quot;scientific&quot; discoveries. They&#39;ll be &quot;aha&quot; moments for  <br/>\nthe child, though. *You* most likely won&#39;t see them, but if the child  <br/>\nis engaged, they&#39;re making connections and having &quot;aha&quot; moments.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My 2 year old learned how to count to 10 by watching Noggin.

While it seems wonderous  <br/>\nthat a 2 yo could master counting, it&#39;s doubtful she really  <br/>\nunderstands the concept of numbers. And yet parents will hold that up  <br/>\nas some great achievement. (Just wait, MIT by the time she&#39;s 6! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more you&#39;re able to see how much more powerful the thinking is to  <br/>\nget through a video game than memorize the numbers, you&#39;ll be much  <br/>\nmore comfortable with unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; if<br/>\n&gt; she colors on the door again (which she has already colored on  <br/>\n&gt; herself, the<br/>\n&gt; kitchen table, the kitchen walls, and now a door) she will get the  <br/>\n&gt; time out<br/>\n&gt; chair, I wondered�.Am I having the correct response?  She is not  <br/>\n&gt; getting it,<br/>\n&gt; the unwanted behavior is continuing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because she&#39;s not able to understand in a way that will prevent her  <br/>\nfrom doing it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat punishment does is say to her that she is deliberately choosing  <br/>\nthe wrong action when she knows better. Think about how you felt when  <br/>\nsomeone accused you of doing something wrong and you had done  <br/>\nwhatever it was with good intentions. Does it make you say &quot;Oh, my  <br/>\ngoodness, thank you for setting me straight!&quot; or does it make you angry?<br/>\n<br/>\nShe *will* eventually be able to understand. In the meantime you can  <br/>\nmake sure markers that are around are only washable ones. Or keep  <br/>\nthem up out of her reach unless she can be closely supervised. *Not*  <br/>\nas punishment but as protection.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would a �wooden spoon� moment teach<br/>\n&gt; her to stop coloring on everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s such an obvious form of parent child interaction that everyone  <br/>\nhas access to it. Every parent could use that without extensive  <br/>\nreading. So, bottom line, if that type of approach worked, then the  <br/>\nwhole world would be so well behaved.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but the parents in my meeting, their collective response is you teach<br/>\n&gt; the child not to color with the markers in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And most parents send their kids to school, too. Doesn&#39;t make them  <br/>\nright.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the primary way of interacting with their kids is to assume their  <br/>\nkids are bad and to punish the badness out of them, I guarantee that  <br/>\na bunch of them will have kids who are rude and defiant and sneaky by  <br/>\nthe time they&#39;re teens. As soon as kids get big enough to realize  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t need to do what they&#39;re told, the parents have no  <br/>\neffective means of interacting with their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have not been able to teach my 2 year<br/>\n&gt; old to stay out of stuff.  I have child locks on the bathroom door  <br/>\n&gt; because<br/>\n&gt; she will go in there and play with the toilet paper, or run the  <br/>\n&gt; sink over,<br/>\n&gt; or anything else you can think of.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some kids *are* more active. It&#39;s not your parenting. It&#39;s who your  <br/>\ndaughter is. Parents who think there&#39;s a one size fits all answer to  <br/>\nunique children either were lucky to have easy kids or have beaten  <br/>\ntheir kids into submission and they&#39;re too scared to do something  <br/>\nthat might get them punished.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s an exaggeration but, if discipline worked, everyone would  <br/>\nbehave perfectly. If it worked, we could have a list of good and bad  <br/>\nbehaviors and shock the ones who don&#39;t stick to the good behaviors  <br/>\nand they&#39;d learn not to stray. Yeah, right.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At this parents home, she does not have<br/>\n&gt; any gates or child locks on her doors<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t either but that&#39;s because my daughter was a very easy child.  <br/>\nAt least that much I realized! I could see that my &quot;successes&quot; with  <br/>\nher were because of her personality, not because of anything I did! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; she teaches her son (who just turned<br/>\n&gt; three) to stay out of such things.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It could be fear he&#39;s reacting to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be his personality.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be he truly gets what she&#39;s saying (which comes back to  <br/>\npersonality.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; how else can I get my 2 year old�s attention without<br/>\n&gt; breaking her spirit or will.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unconditional Parenting is excellent.

I<br/>\nthink you need to take some time to breathe.  I<br/>\nremember, that I spanked my kids once or twice when<br/>\nthey were little.  We stopped doing that, because we<br/>\nwere teaching the kids it&#39;s not nice to hit, but then<br/>\nwe spanked them, so we felt like we were sending them<br/>\na mixed message.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarkers can be cleaned off, or painted over.  If you 2<br/>\nyear old likes to color on things, why not tape pieces<br/>\nof paper where she likes to color, or find her a chalk<br/>\nboard.  I used to let my son go crazy with the<br/>\ncrayons, when he was little, and we lived in a mobile<br/>\nhome.  I thought it was cute, until we decided we<br/>\nneeded to move.  It took some elbow grease, but it all<br/>\ncame off.  One time he was coloring with markers, and<br/>\ncolored all over his skin-he was brown, orange, and<br/>\ngreen.  I cleaned him off, and we laughed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust because other people spank their kids, doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmean that you are in the wrong, because you don&#39;t.  I<br/>\nreally don&#39;t think spanking accomplishes anything.  I<br/>\nused to take stuff away from my daughter, and it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t phase her a bit.  She would just find something<br/>\nelse to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard now, even though my kids are 10 and 11.  I<br/>\nstill have things I need to do, but I always try to<br/>\nmake sure to stop, and spend time with them, and make<br/>\nsure that they know what they do is important to me. <br/>\nI know you have more kids than I do, but being a stay<br/>\nat home mom, and unschooling is a tough job, but can<br/>\nbe really rewarding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if it&#39;s possible, find something you guys can<br/>\nall do together, whether it&#39;s play bubbles outside, go<br/>\nfor walks, or go to a park.  I am finding that I&#39;m<br/>\nputting more things on the back burner, and spending<br/>\nmore time doing things with the kids. Mine were in<br/>\npublic school through their 3rd and 4th grade years.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though at times, I think we are still<br/>\ndeschooling, I think sometimes more me, than the kids,<br/>\nwe are learning things together.  It&#39;s definately more<br/>\nfun than way, and I&#39;m learning right along with them. <br/>\nWe even have movie days sometimes, where I pop<br/>\npopcorn, and ignore the phone, and the housework, and<br/>\njust enjoy quiet time with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only advice is (if you can call it that), to stop<br/>\nbeing hard on yourself, and thinking you aren&#39;t a good<br/>\nmom.  You are not bad for allowing your two year old<br/>\nto be creative, or to not spank your child/children. <br/>\nEveryone has their own parenting styles.  There are<br/>\nalot of people that don&#39;t agree with the way we raise<br/>\nour kids, but I tend to let it go through one ear, and<br/>\nout the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake a deep breath, and relax.  Life is good, and is<br/>\nmeant to be enjoyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, and  enjoy your kids.

I dont know where<br/>\n&gt; to start so if I seem to ramble, please forgive me. <br/>\n&gt; When I first starting<br/>\n&gt; staying at home over 7 years ago, it was due to a<br/>\n&gt; complicated pregnancy.  I<br/>\n&gt; seemed to have time to do all sorts of things.  Fast<br/>\n&gt; forward to the end of<br/>\n&gt; the last school year.  I let my then 4th grader and<br/>\n&gt; Kindergartener finish<br/>\n&gt; their school year, and never took them back.  I<br/>\n&gt; decided to homeschool for<br/>\n&gt; several reasons.  I researched it all summer,<br/>\n&gt; spending hours on the computer<br/>\n&gt; learning about Mr. Holt and Sandra Dodd and<br/>\n&gt; countless others whos name<br/>\n&gt; escapes me.  When I first decided to homeschool, my<br/>\n&gt; vision was waking the<br/>\n&gt; girls up at 8, fixing a good breakfast of homemade<br/>\n&gt; waffles, pancakes,<br/>\n&gt; oatmeal, etc (not all just a variety of such) and<br/>\n&gt; then cleaning off the<br/>\n&gt; table and having school.  I would have<br/>\n&gt; assignments for them to work on;<br/>\n&gt; we would incorporate recess and lunch into our day,<br/>\n&gt; and spend about 4-5<br/>\n&gt; hours doing school.  Then I read about unschooling<br/>\n&gt; and it sounded like<br/>\n&gt; something that would fit better with my kids, but<br/>\n&gt; would take a lot of work<br/>\n&gt; on my part.  I decided it wasnt about me; it was<br/>\n&gt; about my kids, so I<br/>\n&gt; started researching specifically unschooling and<br/>\n&gt; left the research of<br/>\n&gt; curriculum out.  I joined this group along with 2<br/>\n&gt; local groups, one<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling mixed with those that unschool and use<br/>\n&gt; curriculum and one that<br/>\n&gt; was Christian based unschooling.  When our school<br/>\n&gt; district had their first<br/>\n&gt; day back to school, we went on our first homeschool<br/>\n&gt; activity at a local<br/>\n&gt; party place that has the inflatables that the kids<br/>\n&gt; can jump and slide down<br/>\n&gt; and my girls met up with several other homeschooled<br/>\n&gt; kids.  They loved it and<br/>\n&gt; I was introduced to several of the parents.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fast forward to today.  I have come to realize I<br/>\n&gt; stay up too late watching<br/>\n&gt; TV with my 11 year old (they are educational shows<br/>\n&gt; she is interested in but<br/>\n&gt; up until 1 am when my 6 and 2 year old go to bed at<br/>\n&gt; 7).  I wake up tired and<br/>\n&gt; really cranky until I get the coffee running through<br/>\n&gt; my veins.  On Tuesday<br/>\n&gt; and Thursday, my oldest serves at our church from<br/>\n&gt; 10-12 so I make her get up<br/>\n&gt; at 8 to take her shower and get ready to go.  She is<br/>\n&gt; not getting enough<br/>\n&gt; sleep and is /was cranky and hateful until she drank<br/>\n&gt; her coffee.  Yes, I was<br/>\n&gt; letting her drink coffee but her dad had a real<br/>\n&gt; problem with it so I backed<br/>\n&gt; him up and she is no longer allowed to drink it. <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, to stop<br/>\n&gt; rambling.I am not teaching my kids anything,<br/>\n&gt; however they are learning from<br/>\n&gt; the environment I am providing for them.  I stay on<br/>\n&gt; the computer reading<br/>\n&gt; emails, writing down field trips that my local<br/>\n&gt; groups are doing, making<br/>\n&gt; plans to join them, finding ways to save money,<br/>\n&gt; researching recipes to<br/>\n&gt; stretch our ever shrinking food budget, paying<br/>\n&gt; bills, balancing the<br/>\n&gt; checkbook, etc all while my kids are allowed to do<br/>\n&gt; their own thing.  I leave<br/>\n&gt; Noggin on the TV which some shows they will watch,<br/>\n&gt; others they will go into<br/>\n&gt; their room and grab a toy or make up a game to play.<br/>\n&gt;  They all have chores<br/>\n&gt; they do around the house, and we have several<br/>\n&gt; educational toys that teach.<br/>\n&gt; My 6 year old is addicted to her Lepster Lmax so I<br/>\n&gt; bought her some<br/>\n&gt; educational games to play that will help her write<br/>\n&gt; her letters and numbers<br/>\n&gt; correctly and teach her to read.  I am saving them<br/>\n&gt; for Christmas presents,<br/>\n&gt; but she already has 2 games and she learned how to<br/>\n&gt; spell some words with<br/>\n&gt; them.  My oldest is reading books from the library<br/>\n&gt; and watches educational<br/>\n&gt; shows she is interested in and the occasional Hanna<br/>\n&gt; Montana.  I also bought<br/>\n&gt; her 2 sets of educational Computer Programs that<br/>\n&gt; teach math and several high<br/>\n&gt; school courses.  (She is very smart and picked them<br/>\n&gt; out herself to challenge<br/>\n&gt; herself)  My 2 year old learned how to count to 10<br/>\n&gt; by watching Noggin.  Both<br/>\n&gt; my 6 and 2 year olds know several Spanish words from<br/>\n&gt; watching Dora and<br/>\n&gt; Diego.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I writing this email, it doesnt seem as bad as I<br/>\n&gt; thought it was when I<br/>\n&gt; started typing.  I guess I feel like I dont have as<br/>\n&gt; much educational<br/>\n&gt; interaction with them as my parents and in-laws feel<br/>\n&gt; I should and I am<br/>\n&gt; starting to doubt myself as a good parent.  I had<br/>\n&gt; our church bible study<br/>\n&gt; last night and my 2 year old got a hold of a marker<br/>\n&gt; and colored on my oldest<br/>\n&gt; ones door.  When the babysitter (I use the word<br/>\n&gt; loosely, she doesnt seem<br/>\n&gt; to watch the kids well) brought me the marker and<br/>\n&gt; told me she had colored on<br/>\n&gt; the door, I said Thats okay.  She is showing her<br/>\n&gt; creative side which is<br/>\n&gt; challenging me to show my tolerance and patient<br/>\n&gt; side.  One of the other<br/>\n&gt; mothers had a shocked look on her face and said<br/>\n&gt; Wow, that would have been a<br/>\n&gt; wooden spoon moment in our house, and I would have<br/>\n&gt; taught my son that his<br/>\n&gt; creativity goes on paper, not the doors.   As I<br/>\n&gt; proceeded down the hall to<br/>\n&gt; explain to my 2 year old that her pretty drawings<br/>\n&gt; only go on paper and if<br/>\n&gt; she colors on the door again (which she has already<br/>\n&gt; colored on herself, the<br/>\n&gt; kitchen table, the kitchen walls, and now a door)<br/>\n&gt; she will get the time out<br/>\n&gt; chair, I wondered.Am I having the correct response?<br/>\n&gt;  She is not getting it,<br/>\n&gt; the unwanted behavior is continuing.  Would a<br/>\n&gt; wooden spoon moment teach<br/>\n&gt; her to stop coloring on everything.  My approach has<br/>\n&gt; always been, we need to<br/>\n&gt; keep the markers and such out of her reach so that<br/>\n&gt; she doesnt color on<br/>\n&gt; stuff, but the parents in my meeting, their<br/>\n&gt; collective response is you teach<br/>\n&gt; the child not to color with the markers in the first<br/>\n&gt; place.  Their word<br/>\n&gt; teach struck a nerve inside me.  I have not been<br/>\n&gt; able to teach my 2 year<br/>\n&gt; old to stay out of stuff.  I have child locks on the<br/>\n&gt; bathroom door because<br/>\n&gt; she will go in there and play with the toilet paper,<br/>\n&gt; or run the sink over,<br/>\n&gt; or anything else you can think of.  At this parents<br/>\n&gt; home, she does not have<br/>\n&gt; any gates or child locks on her doors, she teaches<br/>\n&gt; her son (who just turned<br/>\n&gt; three) to stay out of such things.  I have a lock on<br/>\n&gt; my 2 year olds door to<br/>\n&gt; keep her in her room at night because she will get<br/>\n&gt; out of her room and get<br/>\n&gt; into all kinds of stuff.  Yes, she has gotten time<br/>\n&gt; out several times and we<br/>\n&gt; have had a couple of wooden paddle moments, but she<br/>\n&gt; still continues the same<br/>\n&gt; behavior.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am writing because I am actually scheduled to see<br/>\n&gt; the author of the strong<br/>\n&gt; willed child speak in person to get help with my 2<br/>\n&gt; year old daughter.  I do<br/>\n&gt; not feel spanking for me personally is the answer. <br/>\n&gt; I feel hypocritical when<br/>\n&gt; I spank my 2 year old because for the 5th time, she<br/>\n&gt; hit the dog.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess my rambling email is two fold.

I don�t know where<br/>\nto start so if I seem to ramble, please forgive me.  When I first starting<br/>\nstaying at home over 7 years ago, it was due to a complicated pregnancy.  I<br/>\nseemed to have time to do all sorts of things.  Fast forward to the end of<br/>\nthe last school year.  I let my then 4th grader and Kindergartener finish<br/>\ntheir school year, and never took them back.  I decided to homeschool for<br/>\nseveral reasons.  I researched it all summer, spending hours on the computer<br/>\nlearning about Mr. Holt and Sandra Dodd and countless others who�s name<br/>\nescapes me.  When I first decided to homeschool, my vision was waking the<br/>\ngirls up at 8, fixing a good breakfast of homemade waffles, pancakes,<br/>\noatmeal, etc (not all just a variety of such) and then cleaning off the<br/>\ntable and having �school�.  I would have �assignments� for them to work on;<br/>\nwe would incorporate recess and lunch into our day, and spend about 4-5<br/>\nhours doing �school�.  Then I read about unschooling and it sounded like<br/>\nsomething that would fit better with my kids, but would take a lot of work<br/>\non my part.  I decided it wasn�t about me; it was about my kids, so I<br/>\nstarted researching specifically unschooling and left the research of<br/>\ncurriculum out.  I joined this group along with 2 local groups, one<br/>\nhomeschooling mixed with those that unschool and use curriculum and one that<br/>\nwas Christian based unschooling.  When our school district had their first<br/>\nday back to school, we went on our first homeschool activity at a local<br/>\nparty place that has the inflatables that the kids can jump and slide down<br/>\nand my girls met up with several other homeschooled kids.  They loved it and<br/>\nI was introduced to several of the parents.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward to today.  I have come to realize I stay up too late watching<br/>\nTV with my 11 year old (they are educational shows she is interested in but<br/>\nup until 1 am when my 6 and 2 year old go to bed at 7).  I wake up tired and<br/>\nreally cranky until I get the coffee running through my veins.  On Tuesday<br/>\nand Thursday, my oldest serves at our church from 10-12 so I make her get up<br/>\nat 8 to take her shower and get ready to go.  She is not getting enough<br/>\nsleep and is /was cranky and hateful until she drank her coffee.  Yes, I was<br/>\nletting her drink coffee but her dad had a real problem with it so I backed<br/>\nhim up and she is no longer allowed to drink it.  Anyway, to stop<br/>\nrambling�.I am not teaching my kids anything, however they are learning from<br/>\nthe environment I am providing for them.  I stay on the computer reading<br/>\nemails, writing down field trips that my local groups are doing, making<br/>\nplans to join them, finding ways to save money, researching recipes to<br/>\nstretch our ever shrinking food budget, paying bills, balancing the<br/>\ncheckbook, etc all while my kids are allowed to do their own thing.  I leave<br/>\nNoggin on the TV which some shows they will watch, others they will go into<br/>\ntheir room and grab a toy or make up a game to play.  They all have chores<br/>\nthey do around the house, and we have several educational toys that teach.<br/>\nMy 6 year old is addicted to her Lepster Lmax so I bought her some<br/>\neducational games to play that will help her write her letters and numbers<br/>\ncorrectly and teach her to read.  I am saving them for Christmas presents,<br/>\nbut she already has 2 games and she learned how to spell some words with<br/>\nthem.  My oldest is reading books from the library and watches educational<br/>\nshows she is interested in and the occasional Hanna Montana.  I also bought<br/>\nher 2 sets of educational Computer Programs that teach math and several high<br/>\nschool courses.  (She is very smart and picked them out herself to challenge<br/>\nherself)  My 2 year old learned how to count to 10 by watching Noggin.  Both<br/>\nmy 6 and 2 year olds know several Spanish words from watching Dora and<br/>\nDiego.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI writing this email, it doesn�t seem as bad as I thought it was when I<br/>\nstarted typing.  I guess I feel like I don�t have as much educational<br/>\ninteraction with them as my parents and in-laws feel I should and I am<br/>\nstarting to doubt myself as a good parent.  I had our church bible study<br/>\nlast night and my 2 year old got a hold of a marker and colored on my oldest<br/>\none�s door.  When the babysitter (I use the word loosely, she doesn�t seem<br/>\nto watch the kids well) brought me the marker and told me she had colored on<br/>\nthe door, I said �That�s okay.  She is showing her creative side which is<br/>\nchallenging me to show my tolerance and patient side�.  One of the other<br/>\nmothers had a shocked look on her face and said �Wow, that would have been a<br/>\nwooden spoon moment in our house, and I would have taught my son that his<br/>\ncreativity goes on paper, not the doors�.   As I proceeded down the hall to<br/>\nexplain to my 2 year old that her pretty drawings only go on paper and if<br/>\nshe colors on the door again (which she has already colored on herself, the<br/>\nkitchen table, the kitchen walls, and now a door) she will get the time out<br/>\nchair, I wondered�.Am I having the correct response?  She is not getting it,<br/>\nthe unwanted behavior is continuing.  Would a �wooden spoon� moment teach<br/>\nher to stop coloring on everything.  My approach has always been, we need to<br/>\nkeep the markers and such out of her reach so that she doesn�t color on<br/>\nstuff, but the parents in my meeting, their collective response is you teach<br/>\nthe child not to color with the markers in the first place.  Their word<br/>\n�teach� struck a nerve inside me.  I have not been able to teach my 2 year<br/>\nold to stay out of stuff.  I have child locks on the bathroom door because<br/>\nshe will go in there and play with the toilet paper, or run the sink over,<br/>\nor anything else you can think of.  At this parents home, she does not have<br/>\nany gates or child locks on her doors, she teaches her son (who just turned<br/>\nthree) to stay out of such things.  I have a lock on my 2 year olds door to<br/>\nkeep her in her room at night because she will get out of her room and get<br/>\ninto all kinds of stuff.  Yes, she has gotten time out several times and we<br/>\nhave had a couple of wooden paddle moments, but she still continues the same<br/>\nbehavior.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am writing because I am actually scheduled to see the author of the strong<br/>\nwilled child speak in person to get help with my 2 year old daughter.  I do<br/>\nnot feel spanking for me personally is the answer.  I feel hypocritical when<br/>\nI spank my 2 year old because for the 5th time, she hit the dog.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my rambling email is two fold.  I don�t want to be one of the<br/>\nparents formally listed as saying they are homeschooling their children when<br/>\nthey aren�t and 2, how else can I get my 2 year old�s attention without<br/>\nbreaking her spirit or will.  I find it all age appropriate behavior, but<br/>\nwhen we are in the presence of other kids her age and her behavior is so<br/>\nmuch worse, and I find out they spank their kids and even keep a wooden<br/>\nspoon with them at all times, I wonder if maybe I am the one that has it all<br/>\nwrong.
