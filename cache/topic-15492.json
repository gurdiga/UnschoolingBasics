It appears that the girls have really enjoyed their evenings.  It&#39;s almost like they have this reservation still about what they&#39;re &#39;allowed&#39; to do, and I think they may be a tad confused about being told &#39;yes&#39; so much - relieved, but a little confused.  They ask me alot &#39;mommy, can I _____&#39; like they&#39;re sure I&#39;m going to say no.  The evenings have been really late!  The first night was after 11, then the next was around 10, then the next was around 9, then the last 2 have been 11:15 and 11:30.  I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re not *bagged* by then because their dad and I sure are!  We haven&#39;t been waiting around like I talked about last time, but the last 2 nights seemed to go on forever.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  This isn&#39;t to say that I haven&#39;t felt the peace of them, we all have felt it and it&#39;s good.  Inspite of being tired I&#39;ve really loved the sweetness and calm of the some of the moments of talking and cuddling and watching them play.  I feel like I&#39;ve experienced major shifts the last few weeks, and...wait for it...perhaps...could I finally be...no...growing up?!?!? :o)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My question is about the transition for the girls.  They are all over the map about what they want.  Is this because we&#39;ve told them what they want so far and they&#39;re feeling it out?  Does it smooth out after awhile?  What I&#39;m referring to is in particular choosing where they want to go to sleep and if they&#39;re hungry.  Okay, here&#39;s the scenario from tonight:<br/>\n   <br/>\n  They are on the couch cuddled with us, sleepy, yawning, then they say &#39;I want to go to sleep in mommy&#39;s bed...or I want to go to sleep in my bed with daddy...or I want to go to sleep in daddy&#39;s bed (same as mommy&#39;s bed &lt;g&gt;) with mommy...etc., you get the picture.  So we toddle on in there, get set up, and then after they&#39;re all set up for that location they&#39;ll change their minds and decide they want to sleep in the other bed with the other parent, or they&#39;ll decide they aren&#39;t ready to go to sleep after all and say &#39;I want something from the fridge&#39;.We literally followed them around for 2 hours doing this last night and tonight, and I had to stay really present, remember to breathe *alot*, and remind myself *alot* that they are just learning to run their own show.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Are we on track with this??  Mostly I am asking about the all-over-the-place quality of their evenings this week, and will they become more certain of what they want regarding bedtime?  And also I&#39;m trying to be okay with my 3 year olds going to bed close to midnight.  So I need some feedback, some reassurance that all is well.  Actually I have repeated &quot;All is well&quot; quite often this week when I have felt like how can I possibly jump through the hoop one more time to give a little girls what she wants.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  This is all a very weird feeling mix of peace and chaos, but at least the girls are happy.  I have seen results in just this short time - they are fighting much less, and they say they love me all the time which is *such* a lovely side effect of this peaceful parenting!  When I look back at pictures of the last 3 years there is much time I regret that I wasn&#39;t totally engaged, totally enjoying them, and I&#39;m grateful that I found this so that I can look back at pictures from this time on and think, wow, am I ever glad I was present, engaged, enjoying.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks y&#39;all.  And no we don&#39;t say this in Canada, but I heard a man from Texas say it recently and I like it.  He also told me that the plural of &#39;y&#39;all&#39; is &#39;all y&#39;all&#39; which I like even more :o).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi  <br/>\n<br/>\nTina Bragdon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jamesandtina942@...\">jamesandtina942@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Live Free Learn Free magazine (has just gone to e mail format)<br/>\n<br/>\nLife Learning magazine<br/>\n<br/>\nTina here in Manitoba Canada<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dory&quot; &lt;carzmom2000@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone know of good unschooling magazines?
