Relationships were estranged for years but come round to some civility now but not very deep. His sister I just about tolerate as she has put our family through a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo after dinner she brought out games to play and started with a card game that said 13+ my oldest is near 14 and all the way down to 3yo wanting to play. She really wanted to play herself and wasn&#39;t thinking of the kids so after listening blankly to the rules I spoke up to say lets try a different game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe set up Guillotine, a fun card game, but she harassed all my kids, including a very strategic 12yo who wanted to think deeply about his possible moves, to hurry up and go, she was stressed that her only baby would wake up and she would have to leave the game. We have six kids and our 10mnth old was also asleep on the sofa. I managed to say I felt a bit harassed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen my 6yo wanted to join in and got up on her husbands knee. Come her turn he made her move for her with no discussion adn moved on. She said &quot;What happened&quot; and &quot;That was no fun&quot;. When I said she would like to make her own turn he said &quot;But she is just a minor&quot; So I took her cards, read them with her and helped her understand her options amid lots of eye rolling from SIL.

It was Linnaea&#39;s birthday and a sword fight in a privately accessible ruin we&#39;d never been to sounded a very good idea. Anyhow as the guy was handing over the keys he was talking about British history, asking the kids for dates of battles. I&#39;m terrible at dates, so I couldn&#39;t step in and offer a hand, but I could distract. Which is what I did and what David did. He&#39;d mention something specific and we&#39;d ask for more detail about it, moving the conversation from some strange testing of children to an almost discussion of something that interested him. Or we&#39;d comment on our own inability to remember dates and talk about his memory for them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a situation where an adult is speaking to Simon who isn&#39;t that comfortable with strangers, I often take the burden of the conversation. I&#39;ve given Simon a few pat phrases, things like no thank you and thank you, yes and just handy little things to say rather than getting stuck in such overwhelming shyness that he just is unable to think of anything at all to say and so is absolutely silent. But, if the conversation goes further than an offer of assistance or food or whatever, if I&#39;m around I tend to do what I can to take the burden. In a situation where someone was pressing Simon to learn something that he wasn&#39;t interested in learning or to participate in something that he didn&#39;t want to participate in, I&#39;d thank the individual soliciting the activity and tell them that my son wasn&#39;t interested. If they pushed their point, I&#39;d talk about how he prefers to explore things in his own way. But I certainly wouldn&#39;t stand silently by while Simon grew more<br/>\n&gt;  and more uncomfortable with the situation. Nor would I help to build up the other person&#39;s frustration with the discrepency between the appreciation and gratitude they felt their generosity deserved and my son&#39;s apparent lack of those emotions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The guy with the keys was showing off. He wanted to talk about something that he knew something about and he wanted to show a trick for remembering dates to this van-load of kids. It is a weird thing, an attempt at engaging a group of children by quizzing them. He wouldn&#39;t have talked to David about the dates of famous British battles. He would have talked to him about volvos and the Bond Bug Reliant Robin he has that David thinks is so cool. He would have talked to me about other things. But children who he hasn&#39;t a clue how to connect with he took an aggressive quizzing approach. It was easy for me to see my kids lack of knowledge about the Battle of Agincourt as a failing on my part to educate them well, at least for a couple of seconds, an embarrassed moment of me the parent/educator. But then I thought a moment longer about how forced the whole structure of the guy&#39;s approach to children was. And how bizarre. It helps a lot to realise that your son<br/>\n&gt;  isn&#39;t wrong or behaving badly by doing his own thing without someone else&#39;s help. This guy who really felt he was owed some sort of engagement with your son is the one who was pushing the relationship between strangers a bit too far. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; People often don&#39;t know how to talk to kids. So they take on inappropriate roles or initiate very contrived or cliched exchanges. It is a desire to connect that makes it happen and, maybe, it will help if y&#39;all can see it as a generous act, even if it is one that isn&#39;t desired. I figure a no thank you is a good response. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Schuyler<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been raised in the old ways of &#39;respect your elders&#39; and I also no longer have trouble talking to people.  (I was a very shy child long ago.)  I haven&#39;t enforced any such rules nor training on my son and he has been free to make his own assessment of people.  Well my son wanted nothing to do with this man and this man did not take kindly to being ignored.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At this point my daughter came up and she being very friendly, she accepted the skating challenges this man started offering her.  He showed her some new skills to help improve her derby skills so as she learned a new trick or two, she would go see what else he could show her. All this was happening right in front of my son who just continued to ignore it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The man decided he would use words to force my son to get up and skate.  When my son continued to ignore his demands for eye contact or even show signs the man existed, the man went on to tell my son &quot;You aren&#39;t worth my time or God&#39;s time.&quot;  Then the man said to me my son needed to be forced to go camping then fed to the bears.

When he does get together with old friends, he has a blast, mostly gaming together, but then goes back to hibernation at home. We&#39;ve moved a ridiculous number of times in the past few years, with few opportunities to meet new kids, so seeing old friends is very rare. My husband and I have been concerned that he&#39;s had such a limited social life, and I&#39;m trying to relax and let him just be. When we have opportunities to go out and do something interesting, exploring Shanghai (just moved here 2 months ago), we tend to pressure him just a bit because it seems he&#39;d stay in our apartment forever if we didn&#39;t &quot;encourage&quot; his getting out every 2 weeks or so. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs this degree of &quot;stay homedness&quot; what people are talking about, or is he even more of a homebody?

Upon pulling up, we saw two kids he had known a few years ago.  I like the kids&#39; mom, but my son doesn&#39;t care for her kids as the younger one tends to be violent.  At seeing them, my son lost what little interest he had in going in. (It&#39;s been over two years since he has seen them and the boys didn&#39;t even recognize each other as they have all changed a lot.) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I told him I really wanted to try skating and it&#39;s a big place.  We can&#39;t just stop living life because we might see someone we aren&#39;t necessarily wanting to socialize with and skating did not require him to hang with those two.  In knowing my son, I figured he was back in his not wanting to try anything new attitude.  (He has skated in the past and liked it but it had been awhile.) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We went in and got skates on.  Since I realize I&#39;ve aged over the years, I approached the skating carefully.  My son stayed attached to my side which is a bit disconcerting as I was trying to re-establish my balance.  Anyway, eventually I wanted to move off the carpet and he begrudgingly stayed with me.  My skills slowly started returning and I was starting to feel ready to take on the floor. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At this point, my son who wasn&#39;t having any major issues on the skates had decided to just sit but he didn&#39;t want me to skate either.  An older gray haired gent decided to get involved and &#39;teach my son to skate&#39; and that&#39;s when it all started coming apart.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been raised in the old ways of &#39;respect your elders&#39; and I also no longer have trouble talking to people.  (I was a very shy child long ago.)  I haven&#39;t enforced any such rules nor training on my son and he has been free to make his own assessment of people.  Well my son wanted nothing to do with this man and this man did not take kindly to being ignored. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At this point my daughter came up and she being very friendly, she accepted the skating challenges this man started offering her.  He showed her some new skills to help improve her derby skills so as she learned a new trick or two, she would go see what else he could show her. All this was happening right in front of my son who just continued to ignore it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The man decided he would use words to force my son to get up and skate.  When my son continued to ignore his demands for eye contact or even show signs the man existed, the man went on to tell my son &quot;You aren&#39;t worth my time or God&#39;s time.&quot;  Then the man said to me my son needed to be forced to go camping then fed to the bears.  I told the man to stay away from my son and not speak to him again.

It&#39;s funny how this one incident stressed me so much and how with the approaching teen years, I started fearing just how alone my son is.  He spent a joyful day with his dad yesterday playing on our farm with all our animals, and they came in when I got home from work, we ate, watched some TV and when it was time for me to get some sleep since I had to work today, they went back out and had a bonfire on our island. Last night my son was out of his funk and back to laughing and being happy.  He said he figures he would some day be interested in getting out to &#39;socialize&#39; but he figures that won&#39;t happen till he is more interested in girls.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good to know other kids go through the same type of phases.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace ad Laughter!<br/>\nVicki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: unschooling in an intentional community (the dark side)","postDate":"1269528554","msgId":43496,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4RjQ0OEM2MDRCRTQ5MEE5RDM4QjhENENDMEJGQjY1QGRlYm9yYWg0M2YxM2ZkPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhvZDQwcytkdWdmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ODEyNDE2Ljc2NTc3LnFtQHdlYjg2MjA1Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDQ3NTczNi45MjQyNC5xbUB3ZWI1NDEwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+IDw4NTI2MDQuNzIwNTMucW1Ad2ViODYyMDEubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPiA8MzUxMTIuNTI0MDYucW1Ad2ViNTQxMDMubWFpbC5yZTIueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43490,"nextInTopic":43497,"prevInTime":43495,"nextInTime":43497,"topicId":43472,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***but just how much can I let him shut the world out?

Is it good for him to completely isolate himself?***<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s with his family, he&#39;s not completely isolated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not enjoy social events.  Going to dinner at someone&#39;s house, even someone I know and love, is not comfortable for me.  Going into stores...not fun.  <br/>\nI can tell you that people telling me I&#39;d have fun if I just tried, etc, has not helped.  The only way I can go into museums and busy places, is by shutting the world out.  It&#39;s a useful skill. &lt;g&gt;  Your son might develop it and  use it selectively in his life.  When there&#39;s something he really wants to do, he can shut out the world and go into that museum or symphony hall or theater.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThe more you try to coax him into engaging in some social activity the more you point out how different he is.  Few people like to be in the spotlight, fewer still for their differences, especially if those differences seem odd.   He might always be this way.   He shouldn&#39;t be made to feel bad about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is *very* awkward to be the one everyone sees as different.  The one people focus on to coax into participating in some event or outing.  Experiencing that kind of unwanted attention as a child did  *not* make me more social.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***he has no trouble getting along with people when he chooses to, it&#39;s just that in the last two years, he is choosing to not.***<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan doesn&#39;t enjoy social outings.  But we go out all the time.  We go hiking, we take the telescope out, we go explore ghost towns, historic sites, go camping, etc.  We do go to museums, book stores, music stores, etc.,  but knowing Dylan&#39;s dislike of crowds we&#39;d go in off hours, during school hours, whatever we might do to avoid the busiest times.   Getting out into the world does not have to be about mixing with other people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA Drive-In is nice alternative to a movie theater.  But we&#39;ve gone to the theater at matinee times and have been the only two people there.  That&#39;s nice because you can ask them to turn down the volume which is always too loud!<br/>\n<br/>\nStop to get sandwiches or pizza to go and drive to a park to eat.   We get sandwiches in a little town about thirty miles away and then go up to the old cemetery to eat.  We eat in the car, then walk around and look at the beautiful old stones.  No annoying people there.  No live ones, anyway.&lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is you can get out into the world without getting out to busy places.   Maybe for the next little while you could just aim for places where there won&#39;t be other people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing Dylan really enjoyed was going for late night walks.   Darkness gives him a sense of privacy, there are few people about, it&#39;s a lovely time to talk. (you get to meet interesting dogs and cats and the occasional skunk or raccoon, too!) &lt;g&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":274177100,"authorName":"Vickisue Gray","from":"Vickisue Gray &lt;vickisue_gray@...&gt;","profile":"vickisue_gray","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: unschooling in an intentional community (the dark side)","postDate":"1269453129","msgId":43490,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3OTkwOS4xNTczLnFtQHdlYjU0MTAyLm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ5REM4MjBCMTYzNjQ5NUZBRjc1RkNENTRCREFFNDAxQExZTEFMQVAyPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhvZDQwcytkdWdmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ODEyNDE2Ljc2NTc3LnFtQHdlYjg2MjA1Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDQ3NTczNi45MjQyNC5xbUB3ZWI1NDEwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+IDw4NTI2MDQuNzIwNTMucW1Ad2ViODYyMDEubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPiA8MzUxMTIuNTI0MDYucW1Ad2ViNTQxMDMubWFpbC5yZTIueWFob28uY29tPiA8NTU0MDkwLjY2MjQ5LnFtQHdlYjg2MjA3Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDQ5REM4MjBCMTYzNjQ5NUZBRjc1RkNENTRCREFFNDAxQExZTEFMQVAyPg=="},"prevInTopic":43489,"nextInTopic":43496,"prevInTime":43489,"nextInTime":43491,"topicId":43472,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks!

Figure out ways to help him be where he is knowing that what he&#39;s got at home is loving and supportive. Bring him food when he&#39;s playing. Touch him, if he likes it. Watch him play things on his xbox. Help him build a cool tower for his cats, if he wants to. Make some hemp scratching posts. Do things that are for him and with him that are all about loving him. And don&#39;t worry about the rest. Worry won&#39;t make anything better, it will just keep you focused on the things you are worried about. And, the more you connect with him the richer you&#39;ll see his life is. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n____________ _________ _________ __<br/>\nFrom: Vickisue Gray &lt;vickisue_gray@ yahoo.com&gt;<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 24 March, 2010 17:02:24<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: unschooling in an intentional community (the dark side)<br/>\n<br/>\nTell Simon thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, my son has been a gamer but since we can&#39;t get anything but a satellite connection, he can&#39;t truly interact on xbox and such.  I know it&#39;s not &#39;unschooly&#39; to use terms like IQ and such, but that seems to be part of my son&#39;s makeup.

I&#39;ve bought him the complete LoF series, college biology books, and found programs online for python, scratch, alice, and a few more.

It gives her a way to decide just how much to interact - she can focus intently on the game, or use the game as a sort of buffer that she can look over and observe other people for awhile. It also provides a way for her to interact just a little bit, by showing someone her game or making a comment about it. Just this weekend we went to a daffodil festival and Mo spent the whole time with her game in her hands, mostly focused, but interacting in little bits, here and there. Its a really valuable tool for her. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people need to observe social situation for a long time before interacting. They need to get a feel for the group as a whole, see who&#39;s friendly and kind and who to avoid, develop some strategies, and Then interact. The social norm is to throw oneself in the middle of a group and learn about it from the inside - but that doesn&#39;t work for &quot;observant social learners&quot;. They (we, I do this) tend to shut down in those situations, or freeze up, unless they&#39;ve figured out strategies that let us &quot;pretend&quot; to interact while really watching everyone else. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"s.waynforth@btinternet.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: unschooling in an intentional community (the dark side)","postDate":"1269451020","msgId":43483,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU1NDA5MC42NjI0OS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNy5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDM1MTEyLjUyNDA2LnFtQHdlYjU0MTAzLm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhvZDQwcytkdWdmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ODEyNDE2Ljc2NTc3LnFtQHdlYjg2MjA1Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDQ3NTczNi45MjQyNC5xbUB3ZWI1NDEwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+IDw4NTI2MDQuNzIwNTMucW1Ad2ViODYyMDEubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPiA8MzUxMTIuNTI0MDYucW1Ad2ViNTQxMDMubWFpbC5yZTIueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43482,"nextInTopic":43485,"prevInTime":43482,"nextInTime":43484,"topicId":43472,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, whether its the hormonal adjustment that teens go through or not, being kind to him is probably better than worrying about him.

I&#39;ve noticed that when he chooses to go and do he is actively engaged in the whole experience, but when he is pressed into something he is just going along to accomodate the other people in his life. I try not to press him very often. I still invite him to most things, but I am willing to accept a no far more than I ever push for a yes. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you fix him? What could you do that would change him? Would working to change him produce the child you want him to be or would it just leave him sure that he is a failure at the whole being a human thing and that his ability to interact with the world is pretty limited? What if you just continue to accept him for who he is? Instead of looking for the things that you think will handicap him as an adult look to the things that strengthen him as the boy he is.

I&#39;m amazed at how much this is bothering me.  Neither of my daughters ever had this sort of issue.  The oldest has always been able to handle most everything that has ever come her way.  The almost 18yo dd, had an interesting habit of just turning her big blue eyes on the person which somehow always had the effect of  them being very kind to her.  Unfortunately, my son&#39;s way of dealing with people is to just have nothing to do with people as a whole.

He asked if your son is a gamer. He figured if he was a gamer he wasn&#39;t isolating himself at all; he was just playing with the world in his own way. Simon is very social on the xbox, playing with lots of people at a go. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve watched Simon wax and wane on his desire to go out and do with other people. I&#39;ve noticed that when he chooses to go and do he is actively engaged in the whole experience, but when he is pressed into something he is just going along to accomodate the other people in his life. I try not to press him very often. I still invite him to most things, but I am willing to accept a no far more than I ever push for a yes. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you fix him? What could you do that would change him? Would working to change him produce the child you want him to be or would it just leave him sure that he is a failure at the whole being a human thing and that his ability to interact with the world is pretty limited? What if you just continue to accept him for who he is? Instead of looking for the things that you think will handicap him as an adult look to the things that strengthen him as the boy he is. I bet there are lots of things that you like. Lots of things. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Vickisue Gray &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vickisue_gray@...\">vickisue_gray@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 24 March, 2010 15:04:48<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: unschooling in an intentional community (the dark side)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your thoughts.

My almost 20yo daughter has joined a roller derby team and had asked us to come skating with her.  So when I got home from work, my daughter was waiting with my son who wasn&#39;t so interested in going.  I told him I would really like for him to come with us for a few hours.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe agreed to come try skating so we went to the rink.  Upon pulling up, we saw two kids he had known a few years ago.  I like the kids&#39; mom, but my son doesn&#39;t care for her kids as the younger one tends to be violent.  At seeing them, my son lost what little interest he had in going in. (It&#39;s been over two years since he has seen them and the boys didn&#39;t even recognize each other as they have all changed a lot.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI told him I really wanted to try skating and it&#39;s a big place.  We can&#39;t just stop living life because we might see someone we aren&#39;t necessarily wanting to socialize with and skating did not require him to hang with those two.  In knowing my son, I figured he was back in his not wanting to try anything new attitude.  (He has skated in the past and liked it but it had been awhile.) <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went in and got skates on.  Since I realize I&#39;ve aged over the years, I approached the skating carefully.  My son stayed attached to my side which is a bit disconcerting as I was trying to re-establish my balance.  Anyway, eventually I wanted to move off the carpet and he begrudgingly stayed with me.  My skills slowly started returning and I was starting to feel ready to take on the floor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, my son who wasn&#39;t having any major issues on the skates had decided to just sit but he didn&#39;t want me to skate either.  An older gray haired gent decided to get involved and &#39;teach my son to skate&#39; and that&#39;s when it all started coming apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been raised in the old ways of &#39;respect your elders&#39; and I also no longer have trouble talking to people.

I agree it does have its drawbacks but the benefits were evident where we were living.  Learning how to make things work in a healthy community is a valuable skill for people of all ages.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe expectations of the community were fair and simple to understand.  Sure some people were grumpy and others more sweet, but no one was shaming children.  A few examples come to mind.  When living so closely with others it is easy for children to feel as though every house is just another extension of their own home.  This was for the most part a good thing, but when people needed their own space they would ask for it.  I did not have an issue with people in the community letting my children know it was not a good time for them to visit. Another example was when a group of children were climbing small apple trees.  I did not see much of a problem with it, but the man who planted and tended to the trees for years did.  He was stressed out thinking the climbers were damaging the trees limbs and pleaded with the children not to climb them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTheir were slight differences and variations in parenting practices were more pronounced, because of the amount of time spent with one another.  It did create tension and conflict, but also offered a chance for all of us to challenge and develop our peace making skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it depends on what your expectations at the time are.  I never expected everyone in the community to be radical unschoolers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefits of having a &quot;village&quot; far outweighed any of the drawbacks.  Children from newborns to young adults lived on the community.  They shared learning through group projects of their own.  I recall the younger ones building a &quot;big rig&quot; out of rope, bikes, a dolly, parts of an broken appliance.  The older boys decided they wanted to get sponsored by a skateboarding company.  This encouraged them to fine tune their reading, writing, filming, editing, marketing, computer, and skateboarding skills in order to pursue their dreams.  Whenever the children had a goal in mind they had community members they could call upon with special skills they needed to acquire in order to accomplish the task at hand.  This could be building with cob, gardening, fruit picking, computers, yoga, swimming, bike riding, or even getting a ride to or from town.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe entire time we lived there and even now when we visit I can say my children hardly ever complained of being bored or inactive.  Except on the fluke occasions when most of the young people are off the community.  Their is something magical about living in a community where even your youngest family members are safe to freely move around, have a group of peers, and adults who value them as complete human beings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a woman it was the most supportive community I have ever lived.  It was amazing to have other woman who lovingly helped one another.  I never felt isolated or alone.  Whenever something came up like a trip to the grocery store, an appt., needing time with husband.  The children were able to choose between coming along or staying behind with others.  It was very empowering for them to be able to make so many decisions, have free range of the community, and mixed age groups to pull off big plans.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRya</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"unschooling in an intentional community (the dark side)","postDate":"1269347948","msgId":43473,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhvYWNwYytiNHZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRmODZmYmViMTAwMzIzMDAyN202YjM0MDEzZWhiYmEzMDM1YTUwYTAyNzRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43472,"nextInTopic":43475,"prevInTime":43472,"nextInTime":43474,"topicId":43472,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve lived in and around intentional communities for years, with and without children, and when I had my dd, Morgan, I made an effort to get away from","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-417689994\">I&#39;ve lived in and around intentional communities for years, with and without children, and when I had my dd, Morgan, I made an effort to get away from community living. Its frustrating to have one&#39;s parenting continually challenged, to have other people actively imposing their ideas of parenting on one&#39;s own children. Even people who seem to all be on the same page, as far as parenting theory are concerned, can have very different actual ways of relating to children. The trouble with having a &quot;village&quot; is that you have all the drawbacks of living in a small town, and in a community, as opposed to an ecovillage, you have much less distance and separation.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling in an intentional community generally also means more rules, more limits on children. That&#39;s hard if what you&#39;re looking for is whole-life unschooling because the community as a whole can (and generally does) deny children resources, and/or force them to do things they&#39;d rather not do. I&#39;ve yet to see a community where children had as much decision making power as they do in a private home, and I&#39;ve yet to see completley non-punitive parenting in a community setting. Children are expected to comply to the community ethos, under the assumption that such is &quot;good for them&quot; and are, at the very least shamed for non-compliance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, if your children are easy-going, they&#39;ll probably be fine in a community setting, and just go with the flow. My kids are more &quot;spirited&quot; and that&#39;s much much harder in a community. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Continuum Concept isn&#39;t the same as unschooling - its similar in some ways, and can inform one&#39;s ideas of natural learning, but its certainly not whole-life/ radical unschooling. The groups in the original CC studies were closed environments, and while its possible to recreate that to an extent, radical unschooling has more to do with expanding kids&#39; worlds than confining them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re welcome to go on reading this list and ask questions! But it may also be a good idea to read the list without comment for a week or two to get an idea what I mean by that. Radical unshcooling *isn&#39;t* the same as living a radical or alternative lifestyle and using that as a basis for unstructured education, its a pretty shockingly different paradigm of parent-child relationships. I know I was shocked at first!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":436114418,"authorName":"Katarina Konkoly","from":"Katarina Konkoly &lt;katarina.konkoly@...&gt;","profile":"katarina.konkoly","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Introduction and keen to form a community","postDate":"1269329240","msgId":43472,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRmODZmYmViMTAwMzIzMDAyN202YjM0MDEzZWhiYmEzMDM1YTUwYTAyNzRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43473,"prevInTime":43471,"nextInTime":43473,"topicId":43472,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi!

We&#39;re a small family of many talents. Our<br/>\ninterests are diverse as physics, permaculture, poetry, etc. Our son is just<br/>\nturning three, and we had the intention to home educate him before he was<br/>\nborn, after reading Underground History of American Education by Gatto. When<br/>\nhe was around 18 months, I read Continuum Concept by Liedloff, and I<br/>\nrealised that the desire to learn is part of every day life, and that what I<br/>\nmost needed to do was provide him with an environment and community where he<br/>\nwas free to learn for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo that end, we&#39;ve been trying to realise our dream of starting an<br/>\nintentional community in a natural environment. At first, we intended this<br/>\nfor our own benefit (since we grew up on the land and yet don&#39;t want to be<br/>\nwage-slaves paying off a mortgage forever just to grow old there). However,<br/>\nseeing the way my son learns, and how fast, I realised that it&#39;s really<br/>\ncritical to do in the short term. He needs many adults doing meaningful<br/>\nactivity that he can learn from, and older children around him who bridge<br/>\nthe distance and make learning in short steps attainable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried living in a city with my husband working, so that we could save<br/>\nsome money to contribute to a community. However, my son is very attached to<br/>\nhis father, and feels it as a physical pain when they are separated. My<br/>\nhusband left work, and we moved to the country, where my husband is starting<br/>\na web based business from home. It&#39;s not going as fast as we would like, and<br/>\nhe may need to go back to work whilst it takes off. I&#39;m dreading this,<br/>\nbecause my son wants to learn from everything his father does. In the mean<br/>\ntime, I&#39;ve been grateful for my son to have had the opportunity to learn<br/>\nabout something other than traffic and roads, and the local townspeople are<br/>\nvery friendly and welcoming.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;d love to form a community in Tasmania or New Zealand, somewhere that&#39;s<br/>\nnot going to be too adversely affected by global warming (at least not as<br/>\nmuch as WA where we currently live). The purpose of the proposed community<br/>\nis to allow the full expression of human potential.

What are your<br/>\nexperiences?
