When my husband was gone, I&#39;d put DD in<br/>\nour Baby Bjorn (like Snugli) and then wear his larger coat over it. She&#39;d<br/>\nhave her fleece hat on and be so cozy against me as I&#39;d feed some animals<br/>\nthat were living in our barn. She kept me warm, too. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/19/04 12:39 PM, &quot;Rebecca DeLong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elfmama_2@...\">elfmama_2@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Leslie530@...\">Leslie530@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;do you have a sling?
