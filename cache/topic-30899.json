HUGE.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have to figure out how to help him repair his chaotic upbringing<br/>\nby raising our kids more gently.

It was<br/>\ntheir Q&A at the end that pushed him over to see this as valid and the<br/>\nright path.  He&#39;s military so being told what to do, and telling<br/>\npeople what to do...Service before Self...it&#39;s so a part of him.  Then<br/>\nthe violence in his childhood.  Oh my...this is HUGE.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU!<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30734,"nextTopicId":31001}}
