Rue Kreams book<br/>\n\t2. A subscription to Connections<br/>\n<br/>\nthen number 3, if you really wanted to get a quick very basic  <br/>\noverview would be Mary Griffith&#39;s book... but that is probably the  <br/>\nsort of thing available in your library ... and once you get the  <br/>\nconcepts maybe not something you keep going back to like Rue Kreams  <br/>\nbook, or even Holt etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway... heres &quot;the list&quot;, probably incomplete... plus my very  <br/>\nsubjective, very personal (ie. you might not agree at all) view on them.<br/>\n<br/>\noh yes, ive also mentioned some mags at the bottom...<br/>\n<br/>\n-----<br/>\nBOOKS<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt; &quot;Parenting A Free Child&quot; by Rue Kream.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>through questions & answers this book covers a lot and gives you a  <br/>\ngreat sense of one families approach to radical unschooling and a  <br/>\nreally compassionate outlook on life and her family.

Might be what you are looking for as a basic introduction  <br/>\nbut if you hang out on this list for a month or two you will probably  <br/>\nfind it not as useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt; &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; by Grace Llewellyn.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i found this relatively dense and in all honesty have not finished  <br/>\nit. But friends rave about it still. I guess i dont have the  <br/>\nattention span of a teenager??? (its pitched at teenagers).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt; &quot;Unprocessed Child&quot; by Valerie Fitzenreiter<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this was written a while ago now and the child in the book (Laurie)  <br/>\nhas now grown up and writes a column for Connections online magazine.  <br/>\nWhile not everything Valerie did clicked with me i loved having a  <br/>\nbook written by someone whose child had &quot;come out the other end&quot; so  <br/>\nto speak ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt; Anything by John Holt...<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most unschoolers i know rave about John Holt. He is the guy that came  <br/>\nup with the term &quot;unschooling&quot; (although he initially meant  <br/>\nhomeschooling by it) and his astute observations on how children  <br/>\nlearn and what was happening in schools have inspired many. I read  <br/>\nthis as my first intro to homeschooling years ago and really need to  <br/>\ngo back to it with less &quot;shit this is crazy&quot; eyes (which is what i  <br/>\nhad at time) ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt; Not Unschooling books but Authors of Note.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>People also talk a lot about John Taylor Gatto � from my perspective  <br/>\nhe is good on critiquing school rather than presenting unschooling,  <br/>\nalthough it sort of happens inadvertently. Then there are all the  <br/>\nalternative parenting bods who are often far from unschooling  <br/>\nspecific but might contribute to some unschooling famiies approach to  <br/>\nparenting like Alfie Kohn (unconditional parenting), Thomas Gordon  <br/>\n(PET), Marshal Rosenburg (NVC), Pam Leo, Naomi Aldort etc etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n-----<br/>\nMAGAZINES<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt; Connections ezine  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://connections.organiclearning.org\">http://connections.organiclearning.org</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>only $10 for a year and gets sent to your inbox.
