Since he is only 4 years old, for us this means less not going to school than more the way he makes choices about what he is interested in to learn, the believe that learning takes place everywhere and any time, the supportive, interesting environment we try to create and the lack of rigid rules we have around food, bedtime and other parts of our family life. We enjoy our time together as a family and my son is thriving in this environment. <br/>\nHere comes our problem though: My son who is usually a pleasure to be around will turn into a wild, oppositional and defiant child when around people who treat him in a not so unschooling way. For example my parents are very authoritarian and expect a child to do whatever they ask for. They have rigid rules around meal- and bedtime, a child should be seen but not so much heard. They usually don&#39;t take the time to listen to my son, interrupt him when he is talking but get very upset if he will interrupt any of their conversations. They are annoyed by all his questions and have actually criticized me for taking the time to answer all of  his &quot;why&#39;s&quot;. Overall there is just not much kindness in their interaction with my son.<br/>\nFrom their point of view I can understand that they think my son is behaving in unacceptable ways but I know that he usually is not this wild and defiant and that his behavior around them is just his response to the way they treat him.<br/>\nI have tried to gently explain to my parents how we raise our son, unfortunately they disagree with our approach and even feel that my son&#39;s behavior around them is prove of our failed parenting.<br/>\nI also have tried to explain to my son that at grandma&#39;s house the rules are different than in ours and that I will help him navigate the unusual terrain. I usually stay close to prevent or help him with any difficult situation. My son is very sensitive to non-verbal, interpersonal reactions and so I can&#39;t rule out that he senses my dislike of how my parents are treating him. I have asked my son if he enjoys his time at my parents house and he says  &quot;yes&quot; but it doesn&#39;t sound as excited as he would be if I asked about other relatives or friends. He has never asked me to stay away from his grandparents.<br/>\nI have thought of avoiding the situation all together by not visiting but I am wondering if I should keep my son away from his grandparents. They do have good times together as long as their conventional parenting doesn&#39;t take over too much. <br/>\nWe live far away from my parents (12 hour flight) so unfortunately short day visits are not really an option.<br/>\nI suppose as my son gets older this might get easier since he will better understand that different people have different approaches to life but I would appreciate any experience how to make this situation easier for my son and my parents (I can see that they are unhappy about the situation too, but unable to change their approach).<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you !<br/>\n <br/>\nSabine<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49488,"nextTopicId":49490}}
