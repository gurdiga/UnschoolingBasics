Everything is connected: <br/>\nyou never know when one thing will lead to or connect with another! <br/>\nUnschoolers know they *do* and will keep searching for those <br/>\nconnections.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling is natural learning. Humans are hard-wired to learn---we <br/>\ncrave it and seek it out. When you believe that, you&#39;re half-way to <br/>\nunderstanding how it works.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling is understanding the difference between teaching and <br/>\nlearning. That&#39;s a HUGE hurdle to overcome before you can &quot;get&quot; <br/>\nunschooling. (I can *teach* you everything *I* know about unschooling, <br/>\nbut unless you&#39;re willing to *learn* it, I&#39;m wasting my time and your <br/>\ntime.)<br/>\n<br/>\n All children can unschool. Many parents can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling requires a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; to make it work. And it works <br/>\nbest when you (the parent) are an active learner. And curious and <br/>\nthoughtful and enthusiastic and interested and interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n It&#39;s about trust and respect and patience.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It helps if you can step OUT of the box. If you&#39;re OK going against <br/>\nthe flow and standing up for yourself (or at least your child).<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;m sure others can add to this, but it&#39;s a start! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.

All without what we&#39;re certain they  <br/>\nneed in order to learn what is necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is unschooling? It&#39;s learning by living life. It&#39;s living a  <br/>\nfull, curious, free life with parents who support, encourage and help  <br/>\ntheir kids pursue what interests them (while making opportunities  <br/>\navailable to expand their interests.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled children learn as a side effect of doing. No child needs  <br/>\nto know how to hammer in nails perfectly before building something  <br/>\nfor their own pleasure. They pound. Then how they nails go in gives  <br/>\nthem feedback on how well they&#39;re doing, they adjust, they take in  <br/>\nadvice (if it seems useful) and figure out better ways to get where  <br/>\nthey&#39;re trying to go. As a side effect of doing something they want  <br/>\n(building a birdhouse or just creating a chunk of wood with nails),  <br/>\nthey get better at the skills needed to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really, really hard to grasp the concept of a child growing up  <br/>\nplaying video and board and card games and spending and saving money  <br/>\nand playing with art software and shopping with parents and cooking  <br/>\nthat they&#39;ll acquire the math they need. And yet they do. Will they  <br/>\nhave the same skills as kids in school? No. They will be weaker in  <br/>\nsome skills and stronger in others. Will those differences be  <br/>\ndetrimental? No, in fact helpful! Because the unschooled kids will  <br/>\nhave a deeper, more fundamental understanding of how numbers work,  <br/>\nwhat contexts various concepts are used in and why. What they often  <br/>\nlack is a concept of the formal notation. And that, they find, is  <br/>\neasy to acquire. It only take minutes to show them how to formally  <br/>\nwrite concepts they deeply understand. It&#39;s the kids in school who  <br/>\nare severely handicapped. They&#39;re trying to absorb the notation on  <br/>\nconcepts they barely understand. It&#39;s hard for most. And it makes  <br/>\nthem shy away from those same concepts in the real world because it  <br/>\nreminds them of their feelings of fear and aggravation in school. The  <br/>\n*hope* is that by repeating the formal notation enough, they&#39;ll  <br/>\ndevelop an understanding of how numbers work. But it so very often  <br/>\nfails. (How many people fear math who&#39;ve gone through that process?)<br/>\n<br/>\n(I do want to mention that I was very good in math at school and went  <br/>\nonto get a degree in engineering. The concept of getting all those  <br/>\nyears of math in from playing video games, et al, was flabbergasting  <br/>\nto me. And yet my daughter decided to take her father&#39;s college  <br/>\nStatistics class for fun at 13. And always had the best scores in the  <br/>\nclass. At 15 she&#39;s taking her 5th college math class (the first ones  <br/>\nwith a teacher other than her father) -- again for fun. And honestly  <br/>\nshe is not a math whiz! She&#39;s just a regular kid who mostly likes  <br/>\nwriting and drawing and pretending. She wasn&#39;t doing math puzzles  <br/>\nunder the covers with a flashlight in the middle of the night nor  <br/>\nbeating her father at chess ;-) What she has gained by living life is  <br/>\na fundamental understanding of how numbers work. *And* a freedom from  <br/>\nfear of numbers and math!<br/>\n<br/>\nI should also mention the goal of unschooling is not good grades, or  <br/>\ntaking college classes at 13. It&#39;s pursuing interests and having fun  <br/>\nand a joyful childhood.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s unschooling in a nutshell, anyway. It&#39;s okay if that sounds  <br/>\ntotally wacko to you. It *should* sound wacko coming from a school- <br/>\nstyle-learning-is-necessary point of view! If unschooling could be  <br/>\nexplained in a few words in a way everyone could truly get what&#39;s  <br/>\ngoing on and why it works there wouldn&#39;t need to be unschooling lists  <br/>\nto help people! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Question about unschooling???","postDate":"1160189230","msgId":17940,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVnNzRmZStxNmNnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVnNnEwNCtoOTE2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17938,"nextInTopic":17945,"prevInTime":17939,"nextInTime":17941,"topicId":17938,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Natalie, Welcome!
