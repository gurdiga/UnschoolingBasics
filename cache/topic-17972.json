I can&#39;t think of an easier state to<br/>\nunschool in!  It is perfectly legal.  All Idaho requires is that the<br/>\nchildren receive a &quot;comparable education&quot; but I couldn&#39;t find any<br/>\ndefinition of what that means exactly. As you already know, Idaho<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t require any portfolios, testing, or anything.  As far as I can<br/>\ntell from reading the laws and talking to other homeschoolers, you<br/>\njust let the school know that you are going to homeschool your kids<br/>\nwith a &quot;letter of intent&quot; and you&#39;re done.  If they have never gone to<br/>\nschool or are already homeschooling, then you are already done with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe what you are saying is that you are worried someone will<br/>\nquestion you?  I can understand that!  To stave off my own fears and<br/>\nParental Panic Attacks, I keep a log of what the kids are doing.  I<br/>\nalso hang on to things they have done or take a picture of it, if it<br/>\nis something that won&#39;t fit into a file.  This isn&#39;t really part of<br/>\nthe unschooling philosophy nor is it required by Idaho law, but it<br/>\nhelps me feel safe.  I do occasionally worry that someone will decide<br/>\nI am doing &quot;nothing&quot; with my kids and send the authorities over to<br/>\ncheck us out.  By keeping a daily log/journal of our activities, I<br/>\nhave something to show the authorities if the come along.  Plus, it is<br/>\nkind of fun.  I am thinking of creating &quot;memory scrapbooks&quot; for each<br/>\nkid and maybe even their own blogs too. (I want to emphasize here that<br/>\nthis is all something that I do for my own peace of mind and my kids<br/>\nare for the most part oblivious to it.  And I never force them into<br/>\nactivities just so I can get it logged - geez, that would not be<br/>\nunschooling.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have any helpful advice for not being able to speak about it<br/>\nto others because I am exactly the same way!  Even to other<br/>\nhomeschoolers, I am very cautious about how I describe what we do and<br/>\nI avoid the word &quot;unschool&quot; like the plague.

I might say something about homeschooling being  such <br/>\na common thing these days that there are far more resources than a  pricey <br/>\nbox of curriculum.<br/>\n <br/>\nOr, you might say when asked how you are getting it done &quot;the boys  happily <br/>\nlearn at their own pace, at home we just don&#39;t have to worry about time  <br/>\nconstraints!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nAll said with a confident smile on your face.
