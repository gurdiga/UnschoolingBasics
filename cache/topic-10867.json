So I run down stairs to  \r<br/>\nthe basement to see what&#39;s going on. She&#39;s on her bed, tears running  \r<br/>\ndown her face with her little friend next to her. When questioned,  \r<br/>\nRachel manages to tell me (between sobs) that her Tiger (big four  \r<br/>\nfoot stuffed animal) is special to her today and she doesn&#39;t want  \r<br/>\nanyone touching it. At that point I can see Elizabeth with her hand  \r<br/>\non the tiger, very solemn look on her face. Rachel is talking, and  \r<br/>\nsuddenly Elizabeth tells me very seriously that when people come over  \r<br/>\nto your house, you just have to learn how to share. Both said a few  \r<br/>\nmore things, but honestly I couldn&#39;t remember them to save my life. I  \r<br/>\ncould tell this wasn&#39;t about the tiger really, and she wasn&#39;t just  \r<br/>\nwanting to be mean, she honestly thinks she was doing Rachel a favor.  \r<br/>\nShe actually said, &quot;Rachel, at some time in your life you just HAVE  \r<br/>\nto learn that you can&#39;t keep everyone from your stuff&quot;. I was  \r<br/>\nsickened, because I could just imagine her parents saying that to  \r<br/>\nher. They are some of my best friends, but please, what a crock. I  \r<br/>\nmanaged to keep calm and patient, and explained in our house we don&#39;t  \r<br/>\nhave that rule, that if someone is feeling that something is special  \r<br/>\nwe try to respect that. Usually they wind up sharing because they  \r<br/>\nwant to.  She seemed to understand that, and I asked her to leave so  \r<br/>\ni could spend some special time with Rachel. I sat there with her on  \r<br/>\nmy lap, and just rocked her back and forth. She truly did not  \r<br/>\nunderstand why anyone would be forced to share something. And what  \r<br/>\nreally pisses me off more than anything (sorry for the language, but  \r<br/>\nhonestly the emotion is so intense i cannot think of another word for  \r<br/>\nit) is I KNOW that her parents have stuff that their kids aren&#39;t  \r<br/>\nallowed to touch. What a double standard, &#39;you have to share all your  \r<br/>\nspecial things, but don&#39;t think about touching MINE because I&#39;m a  \r<br/>\ngrownup&#39; blech blech blech.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGod, I feel so sick. Poor Rachel was having such a great day, they  \r<br/>\nstarted a new club (the shamrock club, of course), and Josh and Emily  \r<br/>\nwere running around tallying how many people wanted to be members,  \r<br/>\npolling what kind of snacks we should have. And its just kind of put  \r<br/>\nRachel in a fragile place emotionally. She&#39;s having a good time now  \r<br/>\nwatching the big kids play marioparty, but I can just sense that it  \r<br/>\ncould break her if one little thing goes wrong. :-(\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSigh.

The two little guys don&#39;t always understand so we help Cass keep  them <br/>\nsafe. One item in her drawer is a lil flower person she made at the 04  <br/>\nconvention. She treasures it so I always make sure I place her items  on top of it to <br/>\nkeep it hidden.<br/>\n <br/>\nI used to have a friend who would hand her children&#39;s toys to my kids and  <br/>\nsay &quot;Oh they don&#39;t want(or need)  it any longer&quot; I felt so sad bc I  could see <br/>\nit in their eyes but they were afraid to say so...<br/>\n <br/>\nMy Dh doesn&#39;t get some things either.

And usually the kids are great too, they  <br/>\ndon&#39;t go crazy on the food or videogames or anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said all that, a little while back I could here Rachel sobbing  <br/>\nand screaming don&#39;t touch that, it&#39;s MINE. So I run down stairs to  <br/>\nthe basement to see what&#39;s going on. She&#39;s on her bed, tears running  <br/>\ndown her face with her little friend next to her. When questioned,  <br/>\nRachel manages to tell me (between sobs) that her Tiger (big four  <br/>\nfoot stuffed animal) is special to her today and she doesn&#39;t want  <br/>\nanyone touching it. At that point I can see Elizabeth with her hand  <br/>\non the tiger, very solemn look on her face. Rachel is talking, and  <br/>\nsuddenly Elizabeth tells me very seriously that when people come over  <br/>\nto your house, you just have to learn how to share. Both said a few  <br/>\nmore things, but honestly I couldn&#39;t remember them to save my life. I  <br/>\ncould tell this wasn&#39;t about the tiger really, and she wasn&#39;t just  <br/>\nwanting to be mean, she honestly thinks she was doing Rachel a favor.  <br/>\nShe actually said, &quot;Rachel, at some time in your life you just HAVE  <br/>\nto learn that you can&#39;t keep everyone from your stuff&quot;. I was  <br/>\nsickened, because I could just imagine her parents saying that to  <br/>\nher. They are some of my best friends, but please, what a crock. I  <br/>\nmanaged to keep calm and patient, and explained in our house we don&#39;t  <br/>\nhave that rule, that if someone is feeling that something is special  <br/>\nwe try to respect that. Usually they wind up sharing because they  <br/>\nwant to.  She seemed to understand that, and I asked her to leave so  <br/>\ni could spend some special time with Rachel. I sat there with her on  <br/>\nmy lap, and just rocked her back and forth. She truly did not  <br/>\nunderstand why anyone would be forced to share something. And what  <br/>\nreally pisses me off more than anything (sorry for the language, but  <br/>\nhonestly the emotion is so intense i cannot think of another word for  <br/>\nit) is I KNOW that her parents have stuff that their kids aren&#39;t  <br/>\nallowed to touch. What a double standard, &#39;you have to share all your  <br/>\nspecial things, but don&#39;t think about touching MINE because I&#39;m a  <br/>\ngrownup&#39; blech blech blech.<br/>\n<br/>\nGod, I feel so sick. Poor Rachel was having such a great day, they  <br/>\nstarted a new club (the shamrock club, of course), and Josh and Emily  <br/>\nwere running around tallying how many people wanted to be members,  <br/>\npolling what kind of snacks we should have. And its just kind of put  <br/>\nRachel in a fragile place emotionally. She&#39;s having a good time now  <br/>\nwatching the big kids play marioparty, but I can just sense that it  <br/>\ncould break her if one little thing goes wrong. :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nSigh. Thanks for listening. i just had to share with someone who  <br/>\nwould understand. My dh would listen, nod his head, but I know he  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get it. he&#39;s a big &quot;Don&#39;t touch my stuff&quot; person too, but  <br/>\nstill thinks that kids should have different rules. We have a huge  <br/>\nfamily, and while most of the toys voluntarily go into public bins, I  <br/>\nreally think the kids deserve to have some stuff of their own. Duh.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s a basic right. Someone on another group just a few days ago was  <br/>\nsaying that she was tossing all of her son&#39;s stuff that wouldn&#39;t fit  <br/>\ninto a bin, it&#39;s just &#39;junk&#39; and besides, it&#39;s not &quot;christian&quot; to  <br/>\nhold physical things dear to your heart. HELLO!? I&#39;m a Christian, and  <br/>\nI hold my things dear, and so do my kids. Why don&#39;t you take another  <br/>\nverse and twist it to your own purpose.<br/>\nSigh. My box is getting slippery, I&#39;d better climb down before I  <br/>\nbreak my neck. Thanks again.<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10841,"nextTopicId":10557}}
