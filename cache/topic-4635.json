They walked home, counting all of <br/>\ntheir steps from the mall to our front door. Why?<br/>\nBecause one of them (my Jared) said &quot;I wonder how many steps people <br/>\ntake every day?&quot; So one of them said &quot;let&#39;s count how many steps it <br/>\ntakes to get back to the house&quot;<br/>\nand off they went.<br/>\nThey counted by 100 each time, then added all their hundreds up. <br/>\nTrevor estimated it would take 1500 steps to get home, it took about <br/>\n1700. They were laughing and sweaty and babbling excitedly when <br/>\ntelling me about this. <br/>\nThey were just having fun with their friends. None of them have <br/>\nlearned that math is something they need to be taught, or anything <br/>\npainful or difficult (ok, Trevor had some of that many years ago, <br/>\nbut luckily he&#39;s healed) it&#39;s just a part of LIFE.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat which we are surrounded by, we tend to pick up naturally, like <br/>\nlanguage.<br/>\nSo things like numbers, arithmetic, culture, history, places, <br/>\netc...are things we pick up, because we use them every day.<br/>\nThings like karate, yoga, oil drilling, flying planes etc...aren&#39;t <br/>\nthings most of us are surrounded by every day, so we  need to find a <br/>\nmentor or class to learn them. It&#39;s specialized information.<br/>\nWhat schools teach is NOT specialized information.<br/>\nIt&#39;s out there for the taking.<br/>\nAnd the most sad thing, is it&#39;s super EASY to pick up if you just <br/>\nwait a while. Instead of wasting a child&#39;s life trying to force some <br/>\nbasic shite on them year after year after year...you can simply <br/>\nallow them to BE and they&#39;ll pick up that &quot;basic&quot; stuff quite easily <br/>\nat some point.<br/>\nIf every bit of k-8 math can be learned in three months by a child <br/>\nthat is interested, then WHY would people spend years trying to <br/>\nshove it down their throats to the point that they have major <br/>\nanxiety over it?<br/>\nAnd WHY would anyone want to bring those methods home?<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust.<br/>\nIt really comes down to that simple word. You either trust your <br/>\nchildren or you don&#39;t. If unschooling is going to work, you MUST <br/>\nlearn to trust them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"more questions","postDate":"1105459972","msgId":4635,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNzMHR1NCtuN2owQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4636,"prevInTime":4634,"nextInTime":4636,"topicId":4635,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I got 233,000 hits on google for mud wrestling (reading)  That s a start!
