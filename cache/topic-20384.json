My husband has the one that he had when he was a kid. He loves sharing it with the kids. We have since found another one at a thrift store. We have also found telescopes and other cool &quot;sciency&quot; stuff at thrift stores too. My girls have picked up on his interest in looking at things under the microscope. I will never forget the time my daughter skinned her knee while riding her bike. While she was sitting there bleeding, she decided that it would be cool to see what her blood looks like under the microscope. We doctored her up and saved some of her blood so we could look at it under the microscope. I think we still have the slide in our slide collection. We were at a store one time and my daughters found a set of prepared slides and had to have them. They have been an unending source of fun. Just last night, we were sitting watching TV and my oldest says, &quot;Hey mom, I wonder what salt looks like under the microscope.&quot; I have no idea where it came from but we got out the microscope and they proceeded to look at salt. That led to a quick look at pepper which led to them digging through the slide box. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest has always loved stuff that falls under the category of science. We never introduce her to stuff while thinking about science though. Science tends to naturally occur because there are so many cool things that can be considered science. Cleaning out my drains with vinegar and baking soda usually gets the kids attention because they love seeing the bubbles. There are so many things that we do in a day that can be considered science. When taking a bath, my girls have noticed that the water rises each time somebody gets in even though the water is off. When they shake up their cokes and explode them, that is science. Cooking in the kitchen is science. The discussion my husband and I had about the tires on his car losing air pressure when it got cold was science. My husband&#39;s love of amateur radio, astronomy, and making homemade beer (including root beer and soda) is science. There is a good chance that you can find science in pretty much anything. There is no need to isolate it from everyday living. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"Kelly Lovejoy","from":"Kelly Lovejoy &lt;kbcdlovejo@...&gt;","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] science question","postDate":"1288091973","msgId":45033,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDRDQzMTZDQzQ2MTc2Ny0xQUNDLTVCMThAd2VibWFpbC1tMDgyLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTE0Ny1kczE1RjQwMkJBRkUwOEI5RjM3RkI4NkNDODQyMEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlhNHU3dCsxMDJjbkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPEJBWTE0Ny1kczE1RjQwMkJBRkUwOEI5RjM3RkI4NkNDODQyMEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":45030,"nextInTopic":45035,"prevInTime":45032,"nextInTime":45034,"topicId":20384,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Renee s list was excellent, and I sent it on to Sandra to be included on her website somewhere.

We have a garden and flowers and fruit trees and<br/>\na worm bin and the kids love to participate along with us.<br/>\n<br/>\n-          They learn stuff about animals by having pets and by visiting the<br/>\nzoo and aquarium and the local farms and the Serpetarium and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\n-          We&#39;ve gone whale watching and we&#39;ve driven up to the mountains<br/>\nwhere they&#39;ve gotten to see deer and elk and other wildlife in person.<br/>\n<br/>\n-          We go geocaching <br/>\n<br/>\n-          My kids gravitate to the science section at the library and often<br/>\ncome home with a pile of nature books.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-          We have an Usborne Children&#39;s Encyclopedia and my son in<br/>\nparticular loves to look through the pictures of space and the planets and<br/>\nsea life and dinosaurs and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\n-          We had a membership to the local Flight Museum for a year and the<br/>\nkids just loved going there and climbing on the planes and looking at stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n-          We have a local science center to visit<br/>\n<br/>\n-          We have 3 Children&#39;s Museums, all of which have some hands-on<br/>\nscience exhibits<br/>\n<br/>\n-          There&#39;s a local sci-fi museum that&#39;s pretty cool<br/>\n<br/>\n-          We go on family walks (we have dogs to walk!) around the local<br/>\ntrails and my kids hunt slugs and try to spot turtles and other life<br/>\n<br/>\n-          We look for constellations and watch the moon wax and wane<br/>\n<br/>\n-          We go down and look for salmon when they are running.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-          The kids look for and collect interesting rocks, leaves, sticks<br/>\nand whatnot<br/>\n<br/>\n-          My daughter is a Brownie girl scout, and they are doing Water<br/>\nJourney this fall which is all about water.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of this is rigorous participation in the scientific method.  But it&#39;s<br/>\nfun and our kids are young.   When they are older we will offer them the<br/>\nopportunity to take on science in a more traditional fashion if they are<br/>\ninterested.  There are science camps in the summer around here, and our<br/>\nhomeschooling group has a Young Inventors and Inventors clubs as well as<br/>\nLego League to participate in.  There&#39;s 4-H and Wilderness School and<br/>\nprobably other opportunities for natural science in a more structured<br/>\nsetting.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-Renee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] question","postDate":"1288052833","msgId":45019,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEIyNDdFNzk4LUZGMjAtNENDRC1CRjJGLUVCRjQxRTg0OEVDMEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlhNHU3dCsxMDJjbkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlhNHU3dCsxMDJjbkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":45016,"nextInTopic":45023,"prevInTime":45018,"nextInTime":45020,"topicId":20384,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He&#39;ll refine his understanding as more bits are  <br/>\nadded, as more connections happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nScience will come from movies, from doing things to see what will  <br/>\nhappen, from observing life, from conversations, from asking questions  <br/>\n-- the questions are more important than the answers actually :-),  <br/>\nfrom seeing connections between very different bits of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids who are fascinated by how the world works will  <br/>\nnaturally do more things that look like science just because it  <br/>\nfascinates them. You won&#39;t be able to stop them!

We started by putting down carpet  <br/>\nand putting lots of towel racks in the wall (the hanging towels  <br/>\nmuffle sounds, I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to hang rugs in the  <br/>\nbathroom!) When that still didn&#39;t work, we bought a camping potty  <br/>\n(basically a five gallon bucket deal, with a seat that fit on the  <br/>\ntop) She was able to use that, and that was much better than 1)  <br/>\nchanging pull ups on a five year old and 2) finding piles and puddles  <br/>\naround the house. :-)<br/>\nAs time passed, she was better able to deal with the noise, and she  <br/>\nslowly transitioned from the potty to the toilet. It helped that we  <br/>\nwere having her dump the bucket after a while. It was easier for her  <br/>\nto do that, than it was to go directly, because there was a lot more  <br/>\ncontrol on her part, she wasn&#39;t vulnerable and unable to escape.

If she is happy and is not <br/>\nasking for more stimulation, then could that indicate that it is your own need and not hers <br/>\nthat is at play? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt caught my eye that you used the word &quot;extracurricular.&quot; If I am willing to trust my child <br/>\nto learn without a curriculum-- then it makes sense to me that I should extend that trust <br/>\nto anything &quot;extracurricular&quot;, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; even though she loves it when she gets there, she never <br/>\n&gt; wants to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kids are so great at living in the moment. They can get caught up in the *now* and it <br/>\nmakes it more challenging for them to leave their current situation to move on to another. <br/>\nIf she wants to take ballet, but has trouble with the transitioning, then you two can discuss <br/>\nways to make the transition smoother for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;Should I make her?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This question raises several concerns for me. First, I am wary of any sentence that starts <br/>\nwith *should.* &quot;Should&quot; is often an arbitrary, cultural expectation that falls to pieces upon <br/>\na thorough examination. Secondly, why would you &quot;make&quot; anyone do anything? I don&#39;t find <br/>\nvalue in things that other people force upon me. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter took ballet when she was 5. We paid quite a bit for the class, costumes, <br/>\nshoes, pictures etc. After awhile she stopped wanting to go, even though she did still  <br/>\nhave fun when she chose to go. She explained to me that she loved ballet, but the dances <br/>\nthey did were not graceful or beautiful, It bothered her that they had to dance to songs <br/>\nlike &quot;Teddy Bear&#39;s Picnic&quot; and &quot;Row, Row, Row Your Boat.&quot; For her ballet was dramatic, <br/>\nclassical music and graceful movements.

In my own head, with him, <br/>\nwith my husband, friends, therapists and this is what I&#39;ve decided.<br/>\nI would be at a loss. Going over it in my head, trying to be mindful <br/>\nof him.. I&#39;m sure you know what I mean. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany times he&#39;ll thank us for taking him to the event after he&#39;s dug <br/>\nhis heels in so deep not to go! <br/>\n<br/>\nMy conclusion is that Yes, I will have to *make* him go sometimes. <br/>\n(He&#39;s old enough to stay alone) We&#39;ve also found out that what he&#39;s <br/>\nfeeling is anxiety. Transitions can be hard. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you should talk to your daughter. Ask her about what makes her <br/>\nnot want to go. Does she *really* like dancing? Ask for her input on <br/>\nwhat you should do when she starts to get tense and say she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to go. She may have ideas for you! I&#39;d also de-brief after. Go <br/>\nover what happened and review how happy she seems *after* and could <br/>\nshe try to remember that when she says she doesn&#39;t want to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do this *all the time* with my son.
