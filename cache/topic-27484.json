My kid  <br/>\nis weird, and I can tell you that a ton of these other kids are weird too. Let  <br/>\nme tell you how mine happens to be weird.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe just turned 18, and he likes us and spends lots of time with us. That&#39;s  <br/>\npretty weird right there. He just started college, and chose a weird college  <br/>\nthat focuses on creativity and authentic learning (Goddard). He&#39;s political and <br/>\n scary smart and really, really funny. He&#39;s super confident and has a <br/>\nwonderful  girlfriend and wants to be a professional musician. He&#39;s a major audio <br/>\ngeek --  not fancy stereos, pa systems and strange stuff I don&#39;t really <br/>\nunderstand. He&#39;s  just so cool. But definitely weird. Uniquely himself.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s that Uniquely Yourself stuff that&#39;s so weird and different from the  <br/>\nSame People. Some kids come out of school with that uniqueness, but it&#39;s hard to  <br/>\ndo. <br/>\n <br/>\nOkay, this is only going to come close to working if your husband is NOT a  <br/>\n&quot;same&quot; guy. I suspect he can&#39;t be if he&#39;s been on board, despite the fears, so  <br/>\nfar.
