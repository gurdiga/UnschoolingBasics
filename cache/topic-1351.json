I<br/>\njust had to keep reminding my self to eat well and to remember my other kids<br/>\nespecially my third.  My third son is such a loving gentle soul that he<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t say anything even if he was getting left out.

He<br/>\n  is a welcome addition to our family and the girls (3 & 5yo) just love<br/>\n  him.  We are recovering, resting and adjusting.  I have been<br/>\n  surprised at how well big sisters are doing.  They have been very<br/>\n  accepting and understanding (almost ambivalent!) to the amount of<br/>\n  time I am devoting to the baby&#39;s needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We are slowing moving toward a new daily routines, and today it<br/>\n  crossed my mind that right now is indeed a test run of the<br/>\n  unschooling life for us!  The girls have had more freedom than ever<br/>\n  this week, and I have been experiencing some separation anxiety of<br/>\n  sorts, I think.  Younger dd has been playing on her own and doing<br/>\n  things I didn&#39;t know she could.  She put herself to sleep, naked<br/>\n  on the couch at 11pm (gasp!) the other night. That same night, older<br/>\n  dd watched unlimited videos (gasp!) and pretended to be an exotic<br/>\n  animal she saw on Zoobomafoo eating bugs out of the dirt for over two<br/>\n  hours  They have been eating when they want, if they want, and<br/>\n  playing in the fenced backyard at will, wearing what they want.  And<br/>\n  everyone is happy but me  I have been feeling so out of sync and<br/>\n  almost unneeded!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ethan seems to be much needier than the girls were.  He is very sweet<br/>\n  but not content unless he is nursing.  If his eyes are open, he wants<br/>\n  to be in my arms and on the breast or he vehemently complains!  He<br/>\n  seems to need much comforting, and it is quite different for us in<br/>\n  this respect, as dds were very laid back and content.  They would<br/>\n  nurse and be happy to hang out in the bouncer or swing when<br/>\n  necessary.  They also slept well in the crib, which brother will have<br/>\n  no part of!  He has been in our bed from day one, which is fine other<br/>\n  than that our bed is only a full size.  He is sleeping well at night,<br/>\n  thank goodness, or I would really be struggling.  It has been<br/>\n  draining to keep up with the nursing to say the least.  I am sure<br/>\n  that my milk is in and flowing.  He is swallowing and passing lots of<br/>\n  stool.  I am wondering if this neediness is temperament or a phase?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I would love to hear how others have fared on their journeys as their<br/>\n  families have grown.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Melissa z.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Blessings to you and your new, improved family!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour sweet post brought me right back to the day when I went into labor for my second child.  My oldest child, Jake (then 3) was sleeping in bed, and I went in and laid by him, held him, and cried my eyes out.  I knew our relationship would forever be changed.  Not necessarily in a bad way, but things would definitely be different in the morning when he had a new brother.<br/>\n<br/>\n***And everyone is happy but me - I have been feeling so out of sync and almost unneeded!***<br/>\n<br/>\nI would definitely let everyone else know that you miss them and that you would love to be by them!  Ask them to bring a book that you can snuggle up and read together while nursing the new babe...find other snuggly, connecting things to do where the focus is not on the new baby, but on your connection with your older children (even just snuggling next to each other, watching TV, whispering secrets, taking turns drawing silly things on a sketch pad...).<br/>\n<br/>\n***Ethan seems to be much needier than the girls were.  He is very sweet <br/>\nbut not content unless he is nursing.  If his eyes are open, he wants <br/>\nto be in my arms and on the breast or he vehemently complains!  He <br/>\nseems to need much comforting***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was my first-born.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith Jake it was his intense awareness of the world that made him *needy*...he is highly sensitive and it&#39;s a lot for a little infant to handle, being born into this world and all (;-)!  The sensory issues that the outside world carried were too much for him, and he needed to retreat to the safe reassurance of his loving mother&#39;s breast much of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe respected and honored his requests and gave him what he needed...and because of this, it was him that introduced us to unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe definitely required more energy than my second child, Sam, but giving him what he needed and required in life allowed him to feel valid and to learn to feel safe in asking for what he needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n***They also slept well in the crib, which brother will have no part of!***<br/>\n<br/>\nJake always slept with us.  Sam never had a crib, and when we would go to those baby stores, he would ask to get into the crib...he would lay there and look at the mobile...it was so funny!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we all shared a bed...in our old home we had one L-O-N-G bedroom with a double and two twins pushed together.  When we built our new house, I still slept with Sam because he wasn&#39;t ready to be on his own...he&#39;s 10 now and sleeping well on his own, but we still love to cuddle together once in awhile!<br/>\n<br/>\n***It has been draining to keep up with the nursing to say the least.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is exhausting, isn&#39;t it?  But oh, so worth it.  He is still so very new to the world, and it&#39;s all so overwhelming for him.  He feels safe and secure on your breast and when he&#39;s ready to emerge and check out the rest of the world, he will, as long as he knows he can retreat back to his safe place when he needs it!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings to you all ~<br/>\nAnne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100027905,"authorName":"TreeGoddess","from":"TreeGoddess &lt;treegoddess@...&gt;","profile":"odrade7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Growing Unschooling Family","postDate":"1088958486","msgId":1374,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwRUMyN0I3LUNERDctMTFEOC1BNTY0LTAwMDM5M0E1REE2NkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENIRUlLT0pLQlBLRUtQR0JNT01FR0VCTkNLQUEuYmx2YXJnYUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PENIRUlLT0pLQlBLRUtQR0JNT01FR0VCTkNLQUEuYmx2YXJnYUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":1366,"nextInTopic":1376,"prevInTime":1373,"nextInTime":1375,"topicId":1351,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He <br/>\nis a welcome addition to our family and the girls (3 & 5yo) just love <br/>\nhim.  We are recovering, resting and adjusting.  I have been <br/>\nsurprised at how well big sisters are doing.  They have been very <br/>\naccepting and understanding (almost ambivalent!) to the amount of <br/>\ntime I am devoting to the baby&#39;s needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are slowing moving toward a new daily routines, and today it <br/>\ncrossed my mind that right now is indeed a test run of the <br/>\nunschooling life for us!  The girls have had more freedom than ever <br/>\nthis week, and I have been experiencing some separation anxiety of <br/>\nsorts, I think.  Younger dd has been playing on her own and doing <br/>\nthings I didn&#39;t know she could.  She put herself to sleep, naked<br/>\non the couch at 11pm (gasp!) the other night. That same night, older <br/>\ndd watched unlimited videos (gasp!) and pretended to be an exotic <br/>\nanimal she saw on Zoobomafoo eating bugs out of the dirt for over two <br/>\nhours  They have been eating when they want, if they want, and <br/>\nplaying in the fenced backyard at will, wearing what they want.  And <br/>\neveryone is happy but me  I have been feeling so out of sync and <br/>\nalmost unneeded!<br/>\n<br/>\nEthan seems to be much needier than the girls were.  He is very sweet <br/>\nbut not content unless he is nursing.  If his eyes are open, he wants <br/>\nto be in my arms and on the breast or he vehemently complains!  He <br/>\nseems to need much comforting, and it is quite different for us in <br/>\nthis respect, as dds were very laid back and content.  They would <br/>\nnurse and be happy to hang out in the bouncer or swing when <br/>\nnecessary.  They also slept well in the crib, which brother will have <br/>\nno part of!  He has been in our bed from day one, which is fine other <br/>\nthan that our bed is only a full size.  He is sleeping well at night, <br/>\nthank goodness, or I would really be struggling.  It has been <br/>\ndraining to keep up with the nursing to say the least.  I am sure <br/>\nthat my milk is in and flowing.  He is swallowing and passing lots of <br/>\nstool.  I am wondering if this neediness is temperament or a phase?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to hear how others have fared on their journeys as their <br/>\nfamilies have grown. <br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa z.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1391,"nextTopicId":1406}}
