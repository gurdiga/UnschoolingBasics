When the 5th Harry Potter book came out (we are big <br/>\nHP fans, and were in a lit. discussion group lead by another fan), <br/>\nthe mom, whose son was 15, said, &quot;BOY, did J.K.

When <br/>\nI ask him to do whatever (it varies), he generally does it <br/>\ncheerfully (but remember, he hasn&#39;t hit 15 yet...), and does not <br/>\nexpect pay (I don&#39;t pay for that sort of thing, any more than I get <br/>\npaid to do the things I am expected to do!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does your son see himself doing?

I have trust issues with<br/>\nhim based on his lackadasical attitude towards life.  I am concerned<br/>\nthat he will miss out on learning necessary life skills unless I push<br/>\nhim, which is the antithesis of unschooling.  Yes, I am aware that my<br/>\nson and I need to resolve the trust issue...does anybody have<br/>\nsuggestions for getting him started?  I plan on letting him decompress<br/>\nthis summer, as well as conversing about life, unschooling, etc.  I<br/>\nhave purchased a copy of &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; and a couple<br/>\nothers for him to browse through and get ideas.  Seems like this is<br/>\nenough for a start...any insights?  Anyone had a similar situation???<br/>\n Thanks!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"Deb Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New Member","postDate":"1132013337","msgId":7726,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTE0LjE3MDg1Ny40NzIuMS5kZHppbWxld0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":7725,"nextInTopic":11085,"prevInTime":7725,"nextInTime":7727,"topicId":7717,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***If you like quotes (and who doesn t?)  there s a folder at www.unschooling.info where people have posted cool and inspiring unschooling quotes.  *** Canine","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1848888188\">***If you like quotes (and who doesn&#39;t?)  there&#39;s a folder at<br/>\nwww.unschooling.info where people have posted cool and inspiring<br/>\nunschooling quotes.  ***<br/>\n<br/>\nCanine Cognitive Dysfunction.
