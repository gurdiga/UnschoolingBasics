Stop giving<br/>\nyourself limitations.  If you have a child that has an interest, by<br/>\ndoing a little research you are sure to find a way to make that<br/>\naffordable for your budget.  There are all kinds of opportunities out<br/>\nthere for our kids.  Unschooling does not mean that you are going to<br/>\nsaturate them with everything possible.

Once the fixed expense stuff is paid, we decide what is <br/>\nimportant that we want to use the discretionary part for. Sometimes <br/>\nit&#39;s saving up for a trip to someplace we want to see and <br/>\nexperience. Sometimes it&#39;s just setting aside some funds to go to <br/>\nthe drive in when there&#39;s a movie we want to see. Sometimes it means <br/>\nhaving the funds to buy the stuff to make really cheesy fondue (with <br/>\nthe good, expensive Ementhaler and Gruyere) with fresh artisan-type <br/>\nbreads and chocolate fondue with fresh strawberries and invite some <br/>\nfriends over. Sometimes it means putting funds aside to pick up the <br/>\njust-released first season of the new Dr. Who series on DVD. It&#39;s <br/>\nall good.<br/>\n<br/>\nUse the summer to drop all the &#39;school stuff&#39;. Just vacation and <br/>\nenjoy being. When the weather starts to cool, keep on vacationing. <br/>\nIf you -want- to go out and buy new crayons and notebooks and stuff <br/>\nbecause they&#39;re on sale, have fun. But you don&#39;t have to. No need to <br/>\nprowl the bookstore and the Internet looking for the workbooks and <br/>\nsuch that you &quot;need&quot; - you don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; them. Go to the library and <br/>\nmax out your library cards on stuff that catches your eye (the <br/>\ncollective you - all the members of the family). <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as people poking in - did you ask them when you had 5 <br/>\nchildren? Did you allow them to question your decision with no <br/>\nanswer? Odds are you basically told them to butt out. Same applies <br/>\nto homeschooling in all its forms - it&#39;s *your* choice for *your* <br/>\nfamily. Politely tell them to either do the research you&#39;ve done or <br/>\nstay out of it - it is not open to debate or unfounded opinion. <br/>\nYou&#39;ll gladly answer questions *once they&#39;ve done the amount of <br/>\nresearch on the subject that you have*.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the people bothering your kids, you can do several things <br/>\n(your choice): you can step in and deflect the questioning (&quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nsorry to interrupt but Billy, could you please go get me a spoon. <br/>\nThanks so much.&quot; basically giving your child a polite excuse to <br/>\nleave the presence of the pest); you can prime the kids with <br/>\nsomething such as &quot;Gee you don&#39;t know that either? Let&#39;s go ask my <br/>\nmom - she helps me find out answers when I have a question&quot;; you can <br/>\nprime the kids with something like &quot;I don&#39;t know that yet (or answer <br/>\nif they do know it). Do you know which Pokemon is the best to fight <br/>\na Fire type?&quot; (basically tossing a question in the child&#39;s area of <br/>\nexpertise back at the questioner).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that the best defense is a good offense so I make sure to <br/>\nkeep a running stream of info flowing to the various extended family <br/>\nmembers and friends - things we&#39;re doing, seeing, exploring. When we <br/>\ntalk about the TWO vacations we&#39;ve had this year before the rest of <br/>\nthe kids were even out of school, about picking berries in the back <br/>\nyard (and DH showing DS how to tell the safe ones from the hazardous <br/>\nones, and where the poison ivy lives and all that) and then helping <br/>\nmake jam and frozen fruit pops (DS goes out every morning and picks <br/>\nwhatever is ripe - he&#39;s just hooked on harvesting fresh berries), <br/>\nabout how DS helped us build the raised boxes for our garden, <br/>\npictures of DS playing with other unschooled kids at a get-together <br/>\na few weeks ago, all that sort of stuff. Basically, we don&#39;t leave a <br/>\nvacuum for questions to form - we are pro-actively filling in stuff <br/>\nfor the grandparents. And, it seems to be working - my parents have <br/>\nbeen cutting out articles as they appear about kids who are <br/>\nhomeschooled AND unschooled and sending them to us with notes <br/>\nlike &quot;This makes a lot of sense&quot; and &quot;Sounds like what you&#39;re doing -<br/>\n looks pretty interesting&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":268214444,"authorName":"Genary","from":"&quot;Genary&quot; &lt;genabeamommy@...&gt;","profile":"genabeamommy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Advice please.............","postDate":"1152115869","msgId":15359,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU4Z29hdCsxMGVtckBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15362,"prevInTime":15358,"nextInTime":15360,"topicId":15359,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi I am the mother of five beautiful children, ages 18 months to 7 years old.
