Trust not <br/>\nschooling makes the world go round. Fear used to make my world stop. <br/>\nI like the trust ride much better. It was a long path to get here <br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess number of children unschooled is a sad commentary on the USA <br/>\nand trust in relationships. Severe understatement to say the least. <br/>\nNow the whole world doesn&#39;t trust USA, the bully. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut every individual makes a difference.
