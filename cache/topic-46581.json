The reason for that being, she naturally wants what<br/>\nshe needs, whether that&#39;s lots of time with an activity or little time<br/>\nor to hoard the experience until she can&#39;t stand it so she can learn she<br/>\nneed not hoard experiences any more.

There&#39;s also the opportunity to invite kids to help without pressuring them to do so - and valuing the help you get. That second part is really important because kids who aren&#39;t required to help Will chip in on their own terms, but younger kids especially don&#39;t always do it in ways that parents might like. For instance, my 9yo feeds the pets, waters the plants, and reminds me to do things like laundry, shopping, and dishes. That&#39;s the sort of thing that might be easily poo-pood by a parent - but then you get a child who&#39;d rather not help at all, since his or her contributions are invalidated. When contributions are valued, kids look for ways to offer more - that&#39;s not a theory ;) its something that happens consistently in unschooling homes. <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren don&#39;t, in fact, &quot;need&quot; to be required to do anything in particular - but if you&#39;ve only ever met people who were required or denied opportunities it can be hard to accept that.

There are no &quot;You need to work&quot; police who  <br/>\nwill throw you in jail if you decide to stop working.

Every day you don&#39;t clean out the bank account and  <br/>\ntake off for Fiji is a day you&#39;ve chosen to be with your family.

But if they open the doors and recognize  <br/>\nthey *could* choose them, they realize they&#39;re not trapped and that  <br/>\nthere are reasons they&#39;re choosing what they&#39;re choosing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but I can choose to<br/>\n&gt; enjoy or not enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is a valuable thing to teach our children;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a big help for unschooling to let go of the idea of teaching and  <br/>\ninstead think in terms of learning.

I have been only mildy successful at unschooling because in the beginning I didn&#39;t have the resources to understand unschooling and I thought it just meant leave them alone.  So, I did.  WRONG!!  I am now equipping myself with many resources, going to as many conferences as we can afford, and trying to surround myself with more like-minded people. I am seeing much progress with this effort. (Still working on the hubby for the &quot;lifestyle&quot; part, though)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Meredith pointed out, get to know your children&#39;s interests and do what you can to find things that might interest them and have them available in the house.  Just because they are available doesn&#39;t mean they will take to them immediately, however.  Realize that you may just need to &quot;strew&quot; these items or you might ask them, in a no-pressure way, if they want to do &quot;x&quot; with you or play  a game.  One of the things my son loves to do is build legos.  I found a site called www.legoquestkids.blogspot.com and we have been working together on trying some of the lego challenges that she has suggested.  My 10 yo works for an hour or longer on the ideas with no interruptions while my 8 yo finishes his idea in 10 minutes and is gone.  They both do this with me under no pressure, but they have different levels of interest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere I got the best advice (maybe from Sandra Dodd&#39;s website, not sure) - if your child is interested in something that you have no interest in, give it a try.  Maybe you will like it and if not, at least it is something that you can understand a little about when they are discussing it.  My personal example - one of my favorite shows of all times is the TV series Avatar:  The Last Airbender.  The boys got hooked on it and kept asking me to watch it with them.  I kind of blew them off at first because I&#39;m not a big TV fan but realized I should join them and learn about it.  I LOVE IT!!!  I want to watch it chronologically now and go all the way through from first episode to last.  Give up any judgements about things and learn about your children and their interests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are several basic &quot;how to&quot; essays linked here:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/howto/\">http://sandradodd.com/howto/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In some ways, there&#39;s only one &quot;step&quot; to unschooling and its to be more involved with your children in direct, personal ways.

I suspect the &quot;steps&quot; you really want/need are how to ease in, and to a large extent that depends on where you are now. If you&#39;re homeschooling, declare a vacation from anything educational - a break. Then live like you&#39;re on vacation - a good vacation where you do fun, interesting things together for the joy of it (not for &quot;educational purposes&quot;). Do that for a year or two. That&#39;s step one, known as deschooling. During that year or two, read more about unschooling, think about it, try things out, see what happens. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have a large family, and find the idea of no schedule a bit daunting. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see how it could work for a small family, but there needs to be some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; direction to our day.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some people do better with a routine, while others prefer to fly by the seat of their pants. There&#39;s nothing anti-unschooling about having a bit of a routine, but don&#39;t think of your children as a homogenous unit, either - notice which ones like some variability, some surprises and actively look for ways to offer those things. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If your kids are used to having direction, then its likely the don&#39;t know what to do without it yet. Regaining the ability to self-motivate is part of the deschooling process (see that link, above, there&#39;s a link to some articles on deschooling on that page). While kids are re-learning that skill, they often need time to do things that were limited by their previous schedules - things like watch a loooooot of tv or play a video games, or surf the web, or talk on the phone. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can help some kids ease in to self-motivation by saying &quot;yes&quot; more to things you&#39;ve restricted in the past - but know that some kids will figure this out and push for more. While its Generally better to ease in, some kids benefit more from diving in wholeheartedly, feasting on previously restricted fun for awhile, and then moving on. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I already hear way too much &quot;I&#39;m bored.&quot; And no, they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do NOT find their own thing to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I said, unschooling is about being very involved with your children, not leave them to their own devices (unless they want that). Help them out. Help them discover if being bored really means they&#39;re lonely, or need something new, or need a direction, or actually need to sit and &quot;be&quot; for a little until the next wonderful idea comes along. &quot;Bored&quot; can mean all those things - sometimes more than one at a time! Kids in transitional stages of development are most likely to be bored on a regular basis - they&#39;ve outgrown the old interests to some extent, and need help finding something new. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s an article on boredom here:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/BoredNoMore\">http://sandradodd.com/BoredNoMore</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and some ideas here:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strewing\">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;two that are always<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bored<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d start by getting to know those kids better. If they&#39;re bored a lot of the time, you&#39;re letting them down - hard news, I know, but happily its something you can fix! You can get more interested in what They find wonderful. Much of the time, kids who are &quot;always bored&quot; are interested in things parents either don&#39;t value or actively limit, so you may need to st-re-tch your mind a little to see the world through their eyes. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s a long winded post, but I&#39;ll bring it back to the one, most important step: connect with your kids.
