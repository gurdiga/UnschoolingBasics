No  mouthyness, not<br/>\nwithout harsh repercussions. Once, I had a child that I  didn&#39;t allow<br/>\nto speak for a whole day - not a word.  A couple of  lectures about<br/>\nrespect, responsibility, and future goals might be in order.  It&#39;s<br/>\ntough being both parent and teacher, but you owe it to the kid to hang<br/>\n in there! You can do this! Days like that, I often declared Chore<br/>\nDays. Once  they realize the choice is schoolwork or scrubbing<br/>\nbathrooms, suddenly  essays didn&#39;t look so hard.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d certainly offer up a different perspective, so the OP knows that<br/>\nthere are some other options! Cripes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like a happy household eh? Boy, I was raised pretty traditional<br/>\nin many ways, but my parents would NEVER have been that cruel. Wow. <br/>\nPoor kids. The worst part is they&#39;ll probably grow up to treat their<br/>\nown children in a similar manner.<br/>\nMaybe not...there&#39;s hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9900,"nextTopicId":9864}}
