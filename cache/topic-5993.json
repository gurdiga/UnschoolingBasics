My dd11 is &quot;doing school&quot; right now.  She decides what she wants to study and then picks out her own stuff from what we have around the house, but she didn&#39;t like any of the math books we had.  She also likes Draw Write Now books, and asked me to get her another of those.   <br/>\n<br/>\nScholastic has some books that are &quot;Homework Helpers&quot; that summarize subjects like American History, Science, and English.  I think she&#39;s reading through a couple of those as part of her schedule.   I really like those because the information is bulletted and easy (for me, anyway) to read.    <br/>\n<br/>\nDeirdre</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5918,"nextTopicId":6001}}
