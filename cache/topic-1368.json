I had wanted to take<br/>\nthe kids to the library but they were closed because of the holiday so we<br/>\nstarted talking about what else we might do.  Mondays I usually do some<br/>\ncleaning up because our band comes over to practice in the evening.  Dc love<br/>\nband night because it fills the house with fun interesting people.  I<br/>\nmentioned also how the dog was recovering from an allergic reaction to fleas<br/>\nand how I wanted to shampoo the carpets to get rid of any lurking there.  We<br/>\nall decided it would make sense to call an all out work day ( with a trip to<br/>\nthe mall thrown in for a video game trade).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust then two little friends of ours called to see if they could come over.<br/>\nWell, yes, they may but we&#39;re  just cleaning the house today.  They said<br/>\nfine, we&#39;ll help.  Our friends are 10 and 11 and are always wanting to come<br/>\nwith us whatever we&#39;re up to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo all 5 kids (my three and 2 guests) spent 3 hours doing chores.  DD made a<br/>\ngame out of it:  Draw a chore out of a jar - Run and do as much as possible<br/>\nfor 15 minutes - Come back and switch if you want.  In the the end the<br/>\ncarpets didn&#39;t get shampooed but lots of things got done I hadn&#39;t even<br/>\nsuggested.  DD&#39;s friend organized her desk and decorated her room with her<br/>\ndolls.  DS&#39;s friend changed my sheets and made the bed.  Between them all we<br/>\ngot the bathrooms cleaned and the back yard free of dog-doo. And even a bag<br/>\nof trash removed from my van.  We stopped every now and then to eat<br/>\nsomething or to play the new video game but for the most part everyone just<br/>\nworked.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I took them home I thanked J and K for their help and laughed that they<br/>\nshould come over more often.  They replied that they&#39;d rather be at my house<br/>\ncleaning than spend the day at their boring house.

There&#39;s lots of helpful ideas all over the place, but <br/>\nthat might be a place to begin.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like what you are experiencing crosses the borders of unschooling <br/>\nthough, too.  You&#39;ve got  the &quot;step&quot; issue and you&#39;ve got a spouse that may <br/>\nfeel he has more control in the relationship because of the &quot;income&quot; issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been in both places, although my dh did not bring children to our <br/>\nmarriage 15 years ago,  I had 2.  It was &quot;touch and go&quot; a lot of the time - you <br/>\ndon&#39;t have an easy road ahead of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did 2 things - I continually told him &quot;I&#39;ll take care of it&quot; - as in, <br/>\n&quot;don&#39;t get all worked up, I&#39;ve got it covered, even if it doesn&#39;t look like it on <br/>\nthe surface.&quot;  I also got a job.  Talk about your major shifts!  Yikes!  I <br/>\nnever realized how much value he placed on income contribution.  It landed us in <br/>\nmarriage counseling for almost a year, when I started making more $$ than he <br/>\ndid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, dh has some &quot;anger management issues&quot; and the older I get, the calmer <br/>\nand more patient I get.  We talk ..... I let him know how it makes the kids and <br/>\nI feel when he gets all wound up.  Sometimes I just give him &quot;the look&quot;.  It <br/>\nis painfully slow progress, but I do feel we are taking teeny tiny baby steps <br/>\nin the right direction.  He is aware of our differences and does try to <br/>\napproach life differently.  He really does try.  I can see it.  He certainly has <br/>\nthings more under control than when we married.  But sometimes he slips but he&#39;s <br/>\nso much more aware now.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was raised in blue collar Detroit, in a macho man neighborhood and home.  <br/>\nI&#39;m sure there was a lot of damage done.  I also try to remember that.  The <br/>\nsame techniques I keep in use in gentle parenting, I try to swing over to <br/>\n&quot;gentle spousing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, in a nutshell, what I guess I&#39;m trying to say is BTDT and with <br/>\npatience, modeling and communication, there may be some hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you all the best - hang in there, you&#39;ll make it!<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Transition from &quot;chores&quot;???","postDate":"1088958531","msgId":1370,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGNjOTdtNCtianZyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":1368,"nextInTopic":1371,"prevInTime":1369,"nextInTime":1371,"topicId":1368,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1963118486\">&lt;&lt;&lt;We have grown to have two VERY different ideas of parenting.

Adrian and I are the only &quot;real&quot; <br/>\nunschoolers in our family.  I&#39;m the appointed chore police officer, <br/>\nand I hate it!  Pat works away from home 10 hours a day plus he does <br/>\nside jobs some nights.  He&#39;s a transmission mechanic, and a very good <br/>\none, so he&#39;s always got work.  I stay home and care for and <br/>\neducate/facilitate learning for the kids, depending on which child <br/>\nand what time of year your talking about.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have grown to have two VERY different ideas of parenting.  He is <br/>\nvery much the authoritive parent.  I&#39;ve tried talking to him and <br/>\nexpressing concern and offering alternatives to the way he handles <br/>\nthings to no avail. Five of the kids are his, and two are mine, so <br/>\nwe&#39;re a little out numbered.  Since becoming a &quot;real&quot; unschooler and <br/>\nimplementing the way of life into more than just my days with Adrian <br/>\nthings have improved.  That is, MY relationship with the kids, not <br/>\nhis, as he does not even have a clue.  He spends A LOT of time being <br/>\nangry about this or that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes down to it, I&#39;ve always been an unschooler in many <br/>\naspects of my life and philosophies.  I just didn&#39;t know it had a <br/>\nword.  The thing of it is that I have to operate around certain <br/>\nparameters.  Those being kids in public school and a &quot;partner&quot; that <br/>\nhas no clue about how to have a real relationship with his children <br/>\nand how to live in a fun and relaxed manner with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat my current dilemma is and what I&#39;d like to figure out is our <br/>\nhousehold chore schedule.  How have any of you made the transition <br/>\nfrom having assigned chores to not having any?  We actually have a <br/>\nsystem that works rather well for us, but it&#39;s no longer working for <br/>\nme.  (The kids each have a room for a week then they switch.  That <br/>\nway no one has to do something they don&#39;t like for very long and very <br/>\noften.  That means that if you just had bathroom you won&#39;t have it <br/>\nagain for over a month.)  See, when a certain few of our kids that <br/>\ndon&#39;t ever want to help out at all or even pick up after themselves <br/>\ndon&#39;t do their part, then I get the blame for it, and it&#39;s a big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m reaching a point that it&#39;s not worth the battle.  I&#39;m already <br/>\npooped.  I&#39;d love to not have to follow said chid/ren around to make <br/>\nsure they did what they were supposed to do so that dad doesn&#39;t blow <br/>\nhis top.  It&#39;s ridiculous!  I&#39;m worried that if I just say, &quot;No one <br/>\nhas chores anymore!&quot; our house would fall apart.  I will be the one <br/>\nresponsible for EVERYTHING.  There are NINE of us.  One child in <br/>\nparticular, 16 yrs, is terrible about taking care of her stuff and <br/>\nthe house.  It effects our whole household.  I&#39;m all for them being <br/>\nable to be slobs as long as it isn&#39;t ruining someone elses day, ie if <br/>\ntheir bedrooms are trashed, but he won&#39;t even let that go.  How do <br/>\nyou achieve that?  How do you have order when no one is expected to <br/>\ndo anything?  Is it possible to transition from the one extreme to <br/>\nthe other when life has been that way for so long?  I know it would <br/>\nbe no biggie if it were just me and my two.  We can live together <br/>\nlike that easily, but we get it.  How do you do it with so many that <br/>\ndon&#39;t?  Is it possible?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you that have been there, done that, what have you done <br/>\nthat worked and didn&#39;t work in your family, and why?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you that are just life experts from education, reading, <br/>\nwhat have you, what is your opinion, and why?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to hear from all of you on this.  Shine some light for me.  <br/>\nMy sanity is on the line...<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1455,"nextTopicId":1454}}
