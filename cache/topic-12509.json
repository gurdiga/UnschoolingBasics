I stayed to sell the house. It took eight months. But BOY! did <br/>\nthat house look GOOD! No one but me there, and I worked all day! &lt;G&gt; <br/>\nThe house was spotless with only me in it---and only at night! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is 8, up til a few weeks ago i would get him to help me with <br/>\nstuff,<br/>\nclearing up, just doing things i felt i needed help with.  I have since<br/>\nstopped doing that, asking him if he wants to help and when he says no, <br/>\nnot<br/>\nbeing bothered and getting on with it myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt feels really difficult, and almost as if he&#39;s worse now than he was<br/>\nbefore.  Say, for example, before he would put his rubbish in the <br/>\nrubbish<br/>\nbin and now he wont do that.

He may not really believe you mean it. He <br/>\nprobably thinks you&#39;ve just gone a little mad and will start making him <br/>\npick up any day now. That&#39;s normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally would have waited until we were moved in to the new house <br/>\nbefore I lifted the cleaning rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe probably ISN&#39;T bothered by it. Bt I&#39;d still ask. Just because you&#39;re <br/>\nnot requiring it, doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t ask. He&#39;s only eight---he has <br/>\ndifferent priorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nOOOH! Does he *want* to move? Or is he mad about leaving this house? <br/>\nThat could give you some insight into what his motivation is! He might <br/>\nclean up voluntarily if he knows that a clean house might sell more <br/>\nquickly. At the same time, losing the only home he&#39;s ever known might <br/>\ninhibit the desire to get it sold tomorrow!<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk him.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nthe thing I feel stuck with, is, is he just doing this so that i can <br/>\nclean<br/>\nup after him? is he being disrespectful?
