My kids (3 and 4.5) watch a two to three minute you tube video of their choosing while we brush their teeth at night. We use spin brushes which help make it fast. In the morning when I brush my teeth I invite the kids to join me. They sometimes do, my 3 year old more often than the 4 year old. In the morning, they brush by themselves most if the time. I have little silicone bristle brushes intended for little kids to bite on to brush their teeth. My 4 year old likes to use that sometimes when he&#39;s playing or watching TV. Mostly they are happy to brush their teeth. At times when they don&#39;t want to (like when they are very tired) we don&#39;t push it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea  <br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Brushing teeth","postDate":"1292275140","msgId":45630,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgzOTQzNi41NjczOC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGllNjAwNCs3ZHE4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGllNjAwNCs3ZHE4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45629,"nextInTopic":45631,"prevInTime":45629,"nextInTime":45631,"topicId":34315,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"  Okay, just to add another it depends to the laundry list ;) I m a chronic mouth breather (or I was as a child, yoga has helped a lot, but still, chronic ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1692257268\">&quot;<br/>\n Okay, just to add another &quot;it depends&quot; to the laundry list ;) I&#39;m a chronic <br/>\nmouth breather (or I was as a child, yoga has helped a lot, but still, chronic <br/>\nsinus stuff) and have no trouble at all with my front teeth, and the backs of my <br/>\nteeth (the lingual side?) always gets compliments when I get my teeth cleaned.

So far we have used an attached playful parenting vibe. Of course this is all done within the realm of trying to make our son brush his teeth happily and voluntarily kind of sort of ie following our agenda. That&#39;s why I was interested to know what radical unschoolers do, and if this is even considered a grey area or not, and if so at what age or always (if that makes sense!). It is the one thing on my agenda twice a day, and although we don&#39;t have a problem per se, and we use the same ideas as that very affirming link (thank you Joyce!), it still boils down to us parents negotiating a way to get our son to do what we think is best. It would never have occurred to me that there could be a different way to approach this, but then suddenly I thought you all might have some different views...so thank you to everyone who has replied and future posters - it is all food for thought and very helpful.

I laughed when I read this, because a few weeks ago  <br/>\nJade (one of my 3 1/2 year old twin girls) told me she didn&#39;t ever  <br/>\nwant to brush because the toothpaste is &#39;howibwe&#39;...it was kids minty  <br/>\nsomething or other.  After she told me that we went out and found  <br/>\nTom&#39;s apricot flavour (tastes like jam) and she&#39;s been brushing non- <br/>\nstop ever since.  Oh, and they also got to pick out a fancy motorized  <br/>\nDora toothbrush which delights them to no end :).<br/>\n<br/>\nNicole Willoughby<br/>\nI encourage my girls to brush and buy them fun toothbrushes, child  <br/>\nfriendly floss, moutwash etc. At their recent dental visits dd8 has 5  <br/>\ncavities shell be going back to have filled and dd 5 has 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow my autistic son who almost never allows us to brush his teeth  <br/>\nwent for his check-up last week and once again has 0 cavities.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeanette Crichton<br/>\nI have always looked for cartoon characters in my kids mouth while I  <br/>\nbrush their teeth.  We have looked for Spiderman, Batman, Star Wars  <br/>\ncharacters, Backyardigans, etc.  Sometimes it gets a little difficult  <br/>\nbecause the kids giggle so much : )  In the beginning I don&#39;t even  <br/>\ncalled it brushing teeth.  I make up some sort of silly name for it,  <br/>\nand I very dramatically &quot;play&quot; with their teeth and the left over  <br/>\n&quot;food&quot; in their mouth.  Tooth brushing is just another playful moment  <br/>\nin our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nIt is interesting, I&#39;ve just been doing a quick and cursory  <br/>\nexploration of the world of oral bacteria via google and found this:  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.db.od.mah.se/car/data/kohlermut.html\">http://www.db.od.mah.se/car/data/kohlermut.html</a> which shows that the  <br/>\nearlier you get mutans streptococci the more prone to caries/cavities  <br/>\nyou are, with absolutely no discussion of how much you brush or floss  <br/>\nyour teeth. Here&#39;s an abstract about the natural history of   <br/>\nStreptoccus sanguinis (a benign oral bacteria) <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://iai.asm.org/cgi/\">http://iai.asm.org/cgi/</a> <br/>\ncontent/abstract/68/7/4018 I think I like it most because it refers  <br/>\nto oral bacteria as &quot;indigenous biota of the human oral cavity&quot;. Oh,  <br/>\nhow I love science!! There is this talk abstract: http:// <br/>\niadr.confex.com/iadr/2002SanDiego/techprogram/abstract_18332.htm  <br/>\nwhich found no difference in colonization of mutans streptococci in  <br/>\ncaries free Swedish teenagers and caries prevelant Swedish teenagers.  <br/>\nSimilar finding here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jdr.iadrjournals.org/cgi/content/\">http://jdr.iadrjournals.org/cgi/content/</a> <br/>\nabstract/77/10/1851 with the added   comment that it isn&#39;t diet that  <br/>\nis doing it. Oh, I could do this for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really cool. It isn&#39;t scary, or something to be used to scare a  <br/>\nchild with, they are cavities, holes in your teeth caused by acids.  <br/>\nThe bacteria, the indigenous biota, are just living there, they are  <br/>\nindigenous. Well, they are indigenous from about 30 months old, on  <br/>\naverage. Yes, toothbrushing makes a difference http:// <br/>\ncontent.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp? <br/>\nAktion=ShowAbstract&ArtikelNr=&#92; 16503&Ausgabe=225458&ProduktNr=224219  <br/>\n(an old paper, 1999, but cool for the British social class stuff --  <br/>\nI&#39;m assuming that&#39;s what the manual versus non-manual mention is  <br/>\nabout).  A big difference. But it isn&#39;t going to keep you clear of  <br/>\ncaries if you are prone to getting them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHard cheese is supposed to be quite good for regulating the  <br/>\npopulation of mutans streptococci, quick search shows that  <br/>\nlactobacilli tends to keep populations of mutans streptococci in  <br/>\ncheck. Xylitol has been shown to reduce plaque and when mother&#39;s chew  <br/>\nit for the first couple of years of   their child&#39;s life the  <br/>\ncolonization of the child&#39;s teeth by mutans streptococci is delayed  <br/>\nand thus caries are less likely to occur.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron Armstrong<br/>\nIt turned out that he just didn&#39;t like the toothpaste.  He had  <br/>\nswitched from a fruit flavored kid toothpaste to a minty adult  <br/>\npaste.  He discovered that he hates mint, but didn&#39;t realize that he  <br/>\ncould just switch back to his old toothpaste.  Now he uses that Crest  <br/>\ncitrus flavor, which has some mint in it, but he doesn&#39;t seem to mind  <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nJodi Bezzola<br/>\n[She] told me she didn&#39;t ever want to brush because the toothpaste is  <br/>\n&#39;howibwe&#39;...it was kids minty something or other.

Oh, and they also got  <br/>\nto pick out a fancy motorized Dora toothbrush which delights them to  <br/>\nno end :).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex P<br/>\now about using xylitol mints and gum instead of brushing?? check  <br/>\nxylitol.org<br/>\n<br/>\nZoa Conner<br/>\nOr peelu gum...<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren Swanay<br/>\nif your child has weak enamel over-brushing can CAUSE cavitites as  <br/>\nwell.  I have strong enamel and take horrid care of my teeth.  I just  <br/>\nturned 37 and have no cavities.  Both my parents have full dentures  <br/>\nand both brothers have mouthes full of fillings. But I can&#39;t for the  <br/>\nlife of me see telling a child that the &quot;bugs&quot; will bore through the  <br/>\nteeth until the child screams in pain will bring you closer or make  <br/>\nthe child think you are nice.  FWIW I&#39;d leave the kid alone.  Tell  <br/>\nthe kid about brushing, why we do it and then leave it be.  My kids  <br/>\nare not forced to brush their teeth.  But they have several flavors  <br/>\nof toothpaste, different brushes, and gauze pads to use instead of  <br/>\nbrushes if they wish.  It&#39;s their mouth...I leave them alone about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nUlrike Haupt<br/>\nTo eat an apple or carrot or piece of fullcorn bread cleanses the  <br/>\nteeth good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nJodi Bezzola<br/>\nI have floosed and brushed every day for my entire 41 year old life,  <br/>\nand yet every trip to the dentist shows up yet another cavity or some  <br/>\nother form of decay.  It&#39;s just the way I&#39;m built.  My husband on the  <br/>\nother hand never flosses, never brushes at night and has never had a  <br/>\ncavity.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa B<br/>\nI have a child in the exact situation.... I made sure to provide lots  <br/>\nof implements ... interesting power brushes, milder toothpaste (or  <br/>\neven no toothpaste!)  and just modeled good dental hygiene.    Making  <br/>\nit a battle isn&#39;t going to accomplish much other than proving to him  <br/>\nthat you don&#39;t trust him and that he can&#39;t trust you.  Forcing a  <br/>\nchild who has what sounds like sensory issues and has a history of  <br/>\ndental issues is really setting him up for difficulty.   My son has  <br/>\ngotten better about brushing now that he&#39;s noticed that sometimes  <br/>\npeople have bad breath... he&#39;s 6 now and will  say &quot;wow mom you need  <br/>\nto brush&quot;  I always say &quot;yes I had garlic for dinner &quot;  hoping that  <br/>\nhe will connect that some foods make your breath stinkier and that  <br/>\nsome things like poppy seeds, strawberries, blueberries etc make your  <br/>\nteeth look icky if you don&#39;t brush.  Ultimately I leave it up to  <br/>\nhim ....I can fix his teeth but his spirit might be trickier!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nThe point was that it often doesn&#39;t help to overstate consequences to  <br/>\nchildren, because it can erode trust if the outcome isn&#39;t what Mom  <br/>\nsaid it would be. I think the use of color tablets or other items  <br/>\nmight be great for some people! The question is whether you should  <br/>\ntell children they&#39;ll get cavities and pain if they don&#39;t brush.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause some will rarely brush and never get a cavity, others will  <br/>\nbrush faithfully and get lots! We don&#39;t want to mislead children in  <br/>\norder to get them to do something. That&#39;s all.<br/>\n<br/>\nJodi<br/>\nI just hand them their toothbrushes with toothpaste on them in the  <br/>\ntub and they brush.  I suggest teeth brushing every morning/every  <br/>\nevening and sometimes they go for it and sometimes they don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaren<br/>\nI am 42. I can eat as much or as little as I please, of whatever I  <br/>\nplease. I can brush my teeth or not. I can even DRIVE to the fast- <br/>\nfood place when I want, and eat what I want there. I&#39;m the one with  <br/>\nthe debit card, so I can buy what I choose at the grocery store. Why  <br/>\naren&#39;t I choosing *only* sweets and Dorito&#39;s, and filling my cart  <br/>\nwith stuff that&#39;s barely food? Because I prefer how I feel when I eat  <br/>\nfood as close to the source as possible, mindfully. *I* feel *better*  <br/>\nwhen I eat that way. Why do I brush my teeth? Because my mouth feels  <br/>\nbetter when I do, and actually, I&#39;ve found my mood is better, too. I  <br/>\nfound that out by *not* brushing my teeth. I had to give *myself*  <br/>\ntotal freedom when we started this journey, too. Now - *everything*  <br/>\nis a choice. Everything. I don&#39;t do things because my mom told me it  <br/>\nwould be good for me. I do things because I WANT to, because of how  <br/>\nmy choices make me feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\nWhen I was a kid I remember being sent to brush my teeth alone and it  <br/>\ntook *hours*. Okay, not really ;-) It felt like hours!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I did with my daughter was to do it with her. We talked and  <br/>\njoked. I made sure she had a brush and toothpaste she liked. I&#39;m sure  <br/>\nI must have mentioned preventing cavities in there at some point.  <br/>\nEventually it became automatic. Sometimes she would say she didn&#39;t  <br/>\nfeel like brushing. I&#39;d say don&#39;t. And she&#39;d say what if I get a  <br/>\ncavity and we&#39;d talk about the difference between habitually not  <br/>\nbrushing and skipping once. I can&#39;t remember her choosing not to  <br/>\nbrush but it would have been okay if she had.<br/>\n<br/>\nswissarmywife<br/>\nFor brushing teeth we&#39;ve made it as easy as possible.  We  used to  <br/>\nbrush our teeth together, now the boys prefer to brush together.   <br/>\nSome kids like a small mirror to watch themselves.  Toothbrushes and  <br/>\ntoothpaste can be moved.  Another bathroom?  Kitchen sink?  We also  <br/>\nlet the kids pick out their brushes.  Right now they really like  <br/>\ntheir electric power ranger brushes!  We also buy natural toothpaste  <br/>\n(Tom&#39;s of Maine kids strawberry) which has a mild flavor they don&#39;t  <br/>\nseem to mind.  We also bought flossers, rather than using regular  <br/>\ndental floss.  My older son has had experience with cavities, so he  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to mind brushing and flossing so much anymore.  for my  <br/>\nyounger one (3) as long as I don&#39;t push he will let me help him out  <br/>\nonce a week or so.  the other times he does it himself.  I know its  <br/>\nnot perfect, but we have sort of made a game with the &quot;EEEE!   <br/>\nAAAAAHHHH! OOOOHHHH!&quot;  mouth shapes.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nmimiphilomena<br/>\nWe use non foaming, non flouride toothpaste (no spitting required),  <br/>\nso brushing and flossing teeth happens in bed, right before story. I  <br/>\nread a story and maybe rub her back a bit, and she is out.<br/>\n<br/>\npolykowholsteins<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/az/sthurston/xylitol_natural_sweetener.html\">http://www.angelfire.com/az/sthurston/xylitol_natural_sweetener.html</a>  <br/>\n&quot;...Xylitol is a dentist&#39;s dream. It reverses all these destructive  <br/>\neffects of sugar on oral health. Xylitol is non-fermentable and  <br/>\ntherefore cannot be converted to acids by oral bacteria, thus it  <br/>\nhelps to restore a proper alkaline/acid balance in the mouth. This  <br/>\nalkaline environment is inhospitable to all the destructive bacteria,  <br/>\nespecially the worst variety, Streptococcus mutans. It also inhibits  <br/>\nplaque formation....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\nAh, yes! My son frequently forgets where he was headed / what he was  <br/>\ngoing to do and it happens with teeth brushing, too. There is much  <br/>\nless stress if we go to do it together. I give him a piggyback ride  <br/>\nto the bathroom, sometimes he brushes his teeth and sometimes he  <br/>\nwants me to do it. I don&#39;t mind helping him brush at all, I think it  <br/>\nhelps him figure out the sensations and movements of what a good  <br/>\nteeth brushing feels like. We talk about each part of his mouth and  <br/>\nhe asks questions, etc. Since he&#39;s fiercely independent in many ways,  <br/>\nit&#39;s a treat for me to be able to do something *for* him. We pause to  <br/>\nchit-chat and giggle. Sometimes we&#39;ll brush our teeth together or  <br/>\nhe&#39;ll want to brush mine for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf told him to go do it he&#39;d make it halfway down the hallway and  <br/>\nstart playing. I&#39;d get frustrated, remind him again, direct him  <br/>\ntoward the bathroom, spot him in the living room a few moments later  <br/>\nand discover he still hadn&#39;t brushed his teeth. I&#39;d send him down the  <br/>\nhallway again with my patience rapidly decreasing, and so on until  <br/>\neventually I was close to yelling and all but dragging him into the  <br/>\nbathroom or on the verge of making threats like &quot;no bedtime story&quot; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a principal behind the act of teeth brushing - taking care  <br/>\nof ourselves so we stay healthy. Both ways are trying to meet this  <br/>\ngoal. One way tries to figure out how to make it happen in the most  <br/>\njoyful, non-coercive way. There are no commands, rules or punishments  <br/>\ninvolved. It does, however, require me to be *present* and actively  <br/>\nengaged with him to accomplish the brushing of teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other way is the opposite. It starts with me thinking I can issue  <br/>\na command and have it obeyed and that should be the extent of my  <br/>\ninvolvement. Every time he needs redirecting my frustration level  <br/>\ngrows because I&#39;m not suppose to have to intervene - I said &quot;do it&quot;  <br/>\nand that should have been it. I choose to turn it into a battle of  <br/>\nwills and to take his inability to complete the task on my timetable  <br/>\nas a sign of disrespect.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich way is respectful towards the child and is more pleasant for  <br/>\nboth of us? Which way is ultimately more hands-on? Which way honors  <br/>\nthe relationship?<br/>\n<br/>\nMeredith<br/>\n**Of course, I kindly remind him to brush his teeth**<br/>\n<br/>\nOne alternative would be to talk about his breath without going  <br/>\nstraight to the solution - I forget that myself and tend to go  <br/>\nstraight to solutions. After all, my solutions are fabulous! Why  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t anyone just want me to tell them what to.... oh, oops.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of supporting autonomy is giving our kids the space to think of  <br/>\nsome of those fabulous solutions on their own - the other part is  <br/>\nthen being willing to help them problem-solve if those &quot;solutions&quot;  <br/>\naren&#39;t exactly what they hoped. To use a montessori truism: &quot;kids  <br/>\nlearn to make decisions by making decisions&quot; and that includes less  <br/>\nthan sucessful decisions, so they can experience the whole process  <br/>\n*with our support* backing them up, and helping them figure out the  <br/>\n&quot;what now&quot;? parts.<br/>\n<br/>\n**So, again I remind him to please brush his teeth. Sometimes, this  <br/>\nhappens several times.**<br/>\n<br/>\nTry starting the conversation in a different place - hey, guy, your  <br/>\nbreath is pretty stinky in the morning, but toothbrushing seems to be  <br/>\na hassle for you... can we find a better solution? If he&#39;s not used  <br/>\nto this kind of problem solving (if mom jumps to solutions, why  <br/>\nshould he be?) he might need some prompting. Can you set up the  <br/>\ntoothbrushing somewhere different? Can y&#39;all look into mouth rinses  <br/>\nfor first thing in the morning? Gum? A tongue scraper? Maybe y&#39;all  <br/>\ncould look into some of the causes of bad-breath together and find  <br/>\nyet more possibilities - like a change of night-time snacks, or more  <br/>\nhumidity in the bedroom or a nasal rinse?  There are dozens of  <br/>\npossible solutions to morning breath and creating a healthier mouth  <br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\n** I suppose I could give up on working with him**<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes a break *is* a valuble solution to explore. Its good to  <br/>\n&quot;red flag&quot; situations where you seem to come up with only two  <br/>\noptions, though. That&#39;s often a good sign that you&#39;ve gotten stuck in  <br/>\nyour thinking - and a good opportunity to go to your kids and say  <br/>\n&quot;hey, I can&#39;t figure this one out, lets put our heads together&quot;. And  <br/>\nif that doesn&#39;t work, well, that&#39;s one of the things these boards are  <br/>\ngreat for - seeing a bunch of different perspectives and possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n============ Question ============<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\nMy 7 year old HATES brushing her teeth. Well she hates to have her  <br/>\nhair combed too. The hair thing.....well who cares, it can be one big  <br/>\nmessy knot and it&#39;s of no consequence. The teeth.....well they are  <br/>\ngonna rot out of her mouth. She does not want me to do it, and she  <br/>\nrefuses to do it herself. So I have let it go for a period of time  <br/>\nthinking it would start to bother her......NOPE, she has fur growing  <br/>\non those babies and she could care less. I&#39;m just not sure how to  <br/>\napproach this one.<br/>\n<br/>\n============ Replies ============<br/>\n<br/>\nJodi<br/>\nActually, this is not true. Tooth rot has more to do with a genetic  <br/>\nroll of the dice than care. I am 36 yrs old and have on paper taken  <br/>\nhorrible care of my teeth. As a child I did not brush for MONTHS.  <br/>\nEven now, I do not brush twice a day (mostly because I have mouth  <br/>\nulcers and at times it&#39;s too painful to brush.) I have NO cavities.  <br/>\nNo rot, no periodontal disease. Both my brothers take much better  <br/>\ncare of their teeth but they have tons of fillings. I really think  <br/>\nit&#39;s just a matter of chance. So as uptight as I am about everything  <br/>\nelse still &lt;bg&gt; on tooth brushing I sort of leave it alone. I remind  <br/>\nevery now and again &quot;Hey, have you brushed your teeth lately?&quot; But I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t ever bug them about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can give other things a try...toothbrushes that make music, light  <br/>\nup, bubblegum toothpaste. Offer different options perhaps. Also gauze  <br/>\non a finger tip works too. Not as good as a brushing but better than  <br/>\nnothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAubrey<br/>\nAbsolutely. My grandmother used to say, &quot;You either got good spit or  <br/>\nbad spit.&quot; I brush my teeth after every meal. I even carry a  <br/>\ntoothbrush and toothpaste in my purse and have been know to give  <br/>\nmyself a quick brush in the car. Last year I had to have 4 root  <br/>\ncanals and 3 cavities fixed! My husband usually brushes once a day,  <br/>\nsometimes twice and very seldom has any problems. I can only remember  <br/>\nhim having one cavity in the last 10 years. My dd was tremendously  <br/>\ninfluenced by our last trip to the dentist. He is very good with  <br/>\nchildren and took the time to show her with a plastic model how to  <br/>\nbrush most effectively. He talked to her on her level and explained  <br/>\nall about dental care. I have also been able to find cute little  <br/>\nbooks about dental care that my kids enjoyed. This helped a great  <br/>\ndeal. Sometimes if we are going out I will ask them if they  <br/>\nremembered to brush and try to remind them before bed but other than  <br/>\nthat I don&#39;t worry too much about it. My own experiences have shown  <br/>\nme that it doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of difference in how many dental  <br/>\nproblems a person has.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\nI do agree with you by the way.  I have one cavity and have not taken  <br/>\nthe best care of my teeth.  My father is the same way, and I&#39;m pretty  <br/>\nsure genetically I got his teeth.  Both of my girls are adopted.  My  <br/>\n9 year old has the worst teeth ever.  I lost count a long time ago on  <br/>\nthe number of cavities she has.  We go to the dentist every six  <br/>\nmonths and she has anywhere from 2-4 cavities every time, and she  <br/>\nDOES brush her teeth.  Now my 7 year old is the one that does not  <br/>\nbrush her teeth.  She only has 1 cavity so far, but really I have no  <br/>\nhistory on how her birth parents teeth were.<br/>\n<br/>\nKendrah<br/>\n  I&#39;ve made teeth brushing a priority. I&#39;ve never forced it, EVER.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve only made it fun and since I model good oral hygiene habits  <br/>\nmyself, they seem to be fine with it. I&#39;ve had at least 4 friends who  <br/>\nchildren (all of whom were under the age of three) had to be put  <br/>\nunder to have cavities filled. One girl&#39;s teeth were literally  <br/>\ncrumbling out of her mouth.  None of these parents practiced  <br/>\nconsistent toothbrushing. If my child starts to resist teethbrushing?  <br/>\nWell, I guess I&#39;ll have to lighten up a bit and hope for the best.  <br/>\nI&#39;d buy different kinds of toothbrushes (electric do a better job in  <br/>\na shorter time), and  toothpastes. I&#39;d hope they&#39;d go to the dentist  <br/>\nso they&#39;d get cleaned good at least  twice a year! I&#39;d continue to  <br/>\nmodel good oral hygiene habits.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb<br/>\nFor us, DS would sometimes comment on my (or DH&#39;s) &quot;morning breath&quot;  <br/>\nby saying our breath was &quot;hot&quot; and we&#39;d go brush. So, when his breath  <br/>\ngets &quot;hot&quot;, I&#39;ll mention it and ask if he wants help or wants to do  <br/>\nit himself (he&#39;s 9). I think that&#39;s another big area of the situation  <br/>\ntoo - just because a child is 6 or 7 or 8 or whatever doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>\nthey &quot;have to&quot; brush on their own by themselves in the bathroom.  <br/>\nSometimes we&#39;ve had three tiered brushing action with DS, then me  <br/>\nlooking over him into the mirror and DH looking over my head (which  <br/>\nusually occasions lots of silliness BTW). Often, DS will request I do  <br/>\nthe brushing for him, so I do. Sometimes we&#39;ll take the toothbrush, a  <br/>\nsmall cup of water to rinse and another cup to spit into (and a small  <br/>\nwashcloth) into the other room and brushing occurs while watching TV.  <br/>\nSometimes brushing doesn&#39;t occur before bed and after breakfast but  <br/>\nat other times of the day when there&#39;s a convenient &#39;pause&#39; in the  <br/>\nactivity level of the day and that&#39;s cool too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nOne thing I did do was buy the ACT floride treatment, which they do  <br/>\nlike to use, and I feel like at least they are strengthening their  <br/>\nteeth even if they don&#39;t brush as well. Eating apples and cheese is  <br/>\nsupposed to be good, as well as a glass of water after meals. We also  <br/>\nplay dentist sometimes, where we take turns brushing teeth. I&#39;ll just  <br/>\nsay that it&#39;s been a while and ask if they want to play dentist.  <br/>\nWe&#39;ve also experimented a lot with brushes and  pastes. For while,  <br/>\nBreanna would let us use a washcloth to clean her teeth, it works as  <br/>\nwell without all the overwhelming sensory issues of the hundred  <br/>\nbristles and toothpaste flavor.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\nThere are things you can do besides actually brushing teeth:  use Dr.  <br/>\nRay&#39;s Spiffies wipes (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.drraysproducts.com/)\">http://www.drraysproducts.com/)</a>.  These are  <br/>\nindividually foil-wrapped wet wipes for teeth that have xylitol in  <br/>\nthem.  My younger ones chew them like gum and then spit them out; she  <br/>\ncould wrap one around her finger or chew it.  The great thing about  <br/>\nthese is you can carry them around with you - she can clean her teet  <br/>\nwhenever she gets the urge.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe can also rinse her mouth with a baking soda or xylitol wash,  <br/>\ninstead of brushing.  Some foods, such as cheese, are good for  <br/>\nteeth.  She can chew xylitol gum or eat xylitol mints  <br/>\n(www.xylitolnow.com, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homesteadmarket.com/about.html,\">http://homesteadmarket.com/about.html,</a> or  <br/>\nwww.xlear.com have good products).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked how we handle it:  half of our family (my sons and I) have  <br/>\nthe strep mutans bacteria that causes early childhood caries (ECC).   <br/>\nEarly Childhood Caries (ECC) is the most infectious disease among  <br/>\nchildren younger than five and is usually transmitted by a parent or  <br/>\ncaregiver (by biting a piece of food and giving it to the child).  My  <br/>\nsons both had partial bridges by the time they were two.  By the time  <br/>\nmy youngest was two, he had 6 teeth pulled and had two lower molar  <br/>\ncrowns.  I could visibly see the teeth dissolving over a two week  <br/>\nperiod and could see a HOLE through one of his molars.  I brush,  <br/>\nfloss, and still was going in for a cavity repair every month or two,  <br/>\nand have 4 root canals and a couple additional crowns.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the changes we made was to brush before instead of after  <br/>\neating.  The bacteria must come in contact with sugar or  <br/>\ncarbohydrates to acidify; even brushing immediately after eating  <br/>\nallows the bacteria to acidify.  By brushing before eating one  <br/>\nremoves the bacterial plaque, which takes twenty-four hours to  <br/>\nrecolonize. We also eat foods to remineralize our teeth and take cod  <br/>\nliver oil, and use xylitol toothpaste and products.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest has not had a single cavity in two years.  One eye tooth  <br/>\nthat had begun calcifying when we made our changes - has not  <br/>\nprogressed AT ALL into any decay (I have an explorer and check for  <br/>\nsticky spots).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do not have any resistance to tooth brushing, is just part of our  <br/>\nroutine like washing hands after using the bathroom.  We keep  <br/>\ntoothbrushes in the kitchen, the bathroom, and the car, for  <br/>\nconvenience (there is no adult looming over them - sometimes we feel  <br/>\nour teeth are fuzzy and are too busy to go to the bathroom to brush  <br/>\nthem - kitchen is then more handy).  My boys would much rather brush  <br/>\ntheir teeth than have emergency extractions for teeth that have  <br/>\nbroken off at the gumline (this happened to my youngest and was  <br/>\nprobably the most agonizing parenting moment I have ever gone  <br/>\nthrough; with the other son his top four teeth broke in half after a  <br/>\nfall onto carpet).  For my boys, they lay on the bed at night and  <br/>\n&quot;mommy robot&quot; brings the robot brush - or they are frozen and the  <br/>\ntooth brush unfreezes them - whatever game they invent, I will do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see there are numerous alternatives to actually brushing,  <br/>\nI hope one of these works for you and your daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nMy youngest has some sensory issues and doesn&#39;t like brushing very  <br/>\noften. He also has teeth that aren&#39;t especially healthy. We found  <br/>\nthis mouthwash that has xylitol and no alcohol, so he loves it. We  <br/>\nalso keep baking soda around.....<br/>\n<br/>\nKrisula<br/>\nI have one kid who neglected his teeth a lot and rarely gets a  <br/>\ncavity.  I have another who is a good brusher and has had lots and  <br/>\nlots of dental issues starting when she was two.  It does seem to be  <br/>\na bit of a roll of the dice.  Some things that helped here:  I offer  <br/>\na small piece of cheddar cheese at bed time to help remedy the PH of  <br/>\nher mouth. My kids like it and it is a really good way to keep the  <br/>\nacid down.   Also, there are so many cool toothbrushes and flavors of  <br/>\ntoothpaste and stuff, now and then we all go get new ones.  It&#39;s  <br/>\nalways fun.  In fact we were at Target today and we each got a new  <br/>\nfancy spinning toothbrush and I bought a different flavor paste for  <br/>\neach kid.  Plus we got those cool little plastic flossers.  I spent  <br/>\nmore than I normally would but they all had a blast and they were  <br/>\nexcited to try it out when we got home.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone, and I can&#39;t remember who, once suggested:<br/>\nLet the child brush your teeth. Then ask if you can brush his. Be  <br/>\nokay if he says no.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;d add you can give him some suggestions as to how, like &quot;Hey, can  <br/>\nyou get the back ones too?&quot; but don&#39;t demand he do it a particular  <br/>\nway. -- It&#39;s likely you&#39;ll have to brush again so don&#39;t look for  <br/>\nperfection! -- The goal is to keep it fun.)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45600,"nextTopicId":45634}}
