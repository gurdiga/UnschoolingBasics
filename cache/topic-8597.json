Consider yourself an <br/>\nhonored guest in their world and soak up the joy of being a  child.  This is <br/>\ngood for you, too!<br/>\n <br/>\nI know with my children, the most important thing they need is my  attention. <br/>\n And the more fully I can be present with them, the better I&#39;ve  done my work <br/>\nand the less tugging they do at me.  When they know they can  get what they <br/>\nneed (unconditional, undivided attention), the less they need to  constantly <br/>\nreassure themselves by being clingy.  It brings about a much  healthier and <br/>\nhappier relationship for all. <br/>\n <br/>\nI obviously have a problem with this, too!   I use the above  ideas for when <br/>\nwe are feeling out of balance and I need to get myself back in  practice.  My <br/>\nclue is usually a clingy child!

Just had to ask, since it was in the mission statement. <br/>\n&gt; Seriously however...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would like to hear from other larger families. We have seven <br/>\n&gt; kids (well, okay, Avari is only <br/>\n&gt; a month old, and not too much involved in the day-to-day stuff) <br/>\n&gt; Josh is ten, Breanna <br/>\n&gt; eight, Emily is seven today (!), Rachel is five, Sam is four, Dan <br/>\n&gt; is two, and you heard all <br/>\n&gt; about Avari.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since I was put on bedrest for most of my pregnancy, it seems <br/>\n&gt; natural that the <br/>\n&gt; homeschooling evolved to unschooling. thankfully, because I had no <br/>\n&gt; energy for all the <br/>\n&gt; stuff I was doing before. now that I&#39;m back to healthy (somewhat) <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m struggling to keep <br/>\n&gt; my controlling nosy body out of their way. and I&#39;m struggling with <br/>\n&gt; the urge to keep my <br/>\n&gt; house clean. I really am type A about that, and need some help <br/>\n&gt; with a) letting go and b) <br/>\n&gt; managing the clutter of six little brains running through the <br/>\n&gt; house all day. And the <br/>\n&gt; noise...oh geesh, a TV, a computer, an electric keyboard, a <br/>\n&gt; &#39;swordfight&#39; and the yelling...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think because I&#39;m new to all this, I really need assurances. And <br/>\n&gt; to be told to keep my face <br/>\n&gt; out of their business. Still working on destressing (I thought we <br/>\n&gt; had that down...now <br/>\n&gt; aware that we are no where CLOSE) and on getting dh used to <br/>\n&gt; uncontrolled chaos. I should <br/>\n&gt; mention that actually the kids do really well, make choices that <br/>\n&gt; for the most part seem <br/>\n&gt; reasonable and to mesh well with mine.  If I ask for help, they <br/>\n&gt; cheerfully join in, and I can <br/>\n&gt; take no for an answer (although if I don&#39;t see a good reason why I <br/>\n&gt; have to bite my tongue <br/>\n&gt; pretty severely)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At this point though, it takes me hours after they go to sleep to <br/>\n&gt; relax enough to sleep <br/>\n&gt; myself. I get gripey, and (ugh) complain in the naggy voice. Maybe <br/>\n&gt; this has turned into a <br/>\n&gt; vent, a little cry for help or reassurance. Anyway, TIA for any <br/>\n&gt; comments or advice. It was <br/>\n&gt; easy to let go of the schooling, the housework and &#39;obedience&#39; is <br/>\n&gt; a little more difficult, <br/>\n&gt; KWIM? It&#39;s been fun even, to let go of restrictions and see them <br/>\n&gt; self limit sugar and TV! <br/>\n&gt; Although five hours of scooby doo episodes are driving me NUTS. <br/>\n&gt; And even more <br/>\n&gt; satisfying to see the look of dismay on my mom&#39;s face when the <br/>\n&gt; kids were choosing <br/>\n&gt; veggies over sweets at Christmas dinner when given the choice (ok, <br/>\n&gt; vicious on my part, <br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll understand!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s midnight and I&#39;m carrying on.

I run <br/>\ndistraction a lot with my energetic child.:)<br/>\nPlaydough and water play are my crutches.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur house stays pretty clean these days. My dh is helping a lot <br/>\nsince we moved though.  Their rooms are pretty disasterous a lot of <br/>\nthe time, but the main living, dining, kitchen area is staying <br/>\npicked up.... amazingly!<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have a small space for yourself? Just a corner of a room, or <br/>\na closet or some space that is just YOURS? It really helps me to <br/>\nhave a meditation area...all the touchstones I need for calming are <br/>\nin there, my books, candles, meditation stones etc... I can&#39;t say <br/>\nenough good about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there is nothing wrong with doing the cleaning while your <br/>\nchildren play happily. As long as they are busy, go ahead and BE <br/>\ntype A.:)  Just be willing to stop when they need you (it sounds <br/>\nlike you do).<br/>\nI found a great game when I need to get stuff done...hide-n-seek. As <br/>\nI search room to room, I&#39;m picking stuff up at the same time. We can <br/>\ngo on for hours like this!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"multimomma","from":"&quot;multimomma&quot; &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"so...how does unschooling work in real families?","postDate":"1135838087","msgId":8597,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRwMDAyNyszZThrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8600,"prevInTime":8596,"nextInTime":8598,"topicId":8597,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"LOL!

Seriously however...<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to hear from other larger families. We have seven kids (well, okay, Avari is only <br/>\na month old, and not too much involved in the day-to-day stuff) Josh is ten, Breanna <br/>\neight, Emily is seven today (!), Rachel is five, Sam is four, Dan is two, and you heard all <br/>\nabout Avari.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I was put on bedrest for most of my pregnancy, it seems natural that the <br/>\nhomeschooling evolved to unschooling. thankfully, because I had no energy for all the <br/>\nstuff I was doing before. now that I&#39;m back to healthy (somewhat) I&#39;m struggling to keep <br/>\nmy controlling nosy body out of their way. and I&#39;m struggling with the urge to keep my <br/>\nhouse clean. I really am type A about that, and need some help with a) letting go and b) <br/>\nmanaging the clutter of six little brains running through the house all day. And the <br/>\nnoise...oh geesh, a TV, a computer, an electric keyboard, a &#39;swordfight&#39; and the yelling...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think because I&#39;m new to all this, I really need assurances. And to be told to keep my face <br/>\nout of their business. Still working on destressing (I thought we had that down...now <br/>\naware that we are no where CLOSE) and on getting dh used to uncontrolled chaos. I should <br/>\nmention that actually the kids do really well, make choices that for the most part seem <br/>\nreasonable and to mesh well with mine.  If I ask for help, they cheerfully join in, and I can <br/>\ntake no for an answer (although if I don&#39;t see a good reason why I have to bite my tongue <br/>\npretty severely)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point though, it takes me hours after they go to sleep to relax enough to sleep <br/>\nmyself. I get gripey, and (ugh) complain in the naggy voice. Maybe this has turned into a <br/>\nvent, a little cry for help or reassurance. Anyway, TIA for any comments or advice. It was <br/>\neasy to let go of the schooling, the housework and &#39;obedience&#39; is a little more difficult, <br/>\nKWIM? It&#39;s been fun even, to let go of restrictions and see them self limit sugar and TV! <br/>\nAlthough five hours of scooby doo episodes are driving me NUTS. And even more <br/>\nsatisfying to see the look of dismay on my mom&#39;s face when the kids were choosing <br/>\nveggies over sweets at Christmas dinner when given the choice (ok, vicious on my part, <br/>\nbut I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll understand!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s midnight and I&#39;m carrying on. FWIW...I&#39;m reading at the AlwaysLearning group as well. <br/>\nAppreciate the work of both moderators. Thanks<br/>\nmelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8619,"nextTopicId":8654}}
