The older kids obviously know their parents well enough to know that blaming your son (who after all is younger and doesnt know as well) will save them from the consequences - which may have been being grounded, banned from being with their other friends etc.  With the blame being placed on your son the parents may have given him a break because he was younger, if you get what I mean.

I mean - people who use drugs are horrible, horrible people! But I LOVED my uncle! It was a few years later that I realized I had been fed lies about drugs, drug users, etc. - which probably made my use of it more certain!<br/>\n<br/>\n  So these kids are still figuring out: What&#39;s the truth for me? And they are forced to act one way around their parents, and choose to act another way when their parents aren&#39;t there. What&#39;s sad is that because of their parents&#39; control and close-mindedness, it will take them longer to figure out *their* truth. Maybe they are offended, but cuss when the parents aren&#39;t there to rebel.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was so surprised when Seth (my 10 y.o.) let me know HE&#39;S offended by cussing! I mean, he&#39;s the king of fart jokes, and cussing has never been a big deal to us. I hardly cuss, but sometimes, F**K! fits the bill. If that happened around Seth, his eyes would get big: &quot;I really don&#39;t like it when you say that.&quot; Oh, oops. OK! So I&#39;ve gotten better about saying, &quot;Fricken fracken grumble, grumble&quot; and stomping when he&#39;s around. I rarely get that frustrated anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe your son could ask his friends how they DO feel about cussing? OK, not OK around them? OK when Dad&#39;s not close by?

BIL and<br/>\nassorted other folks, not to mention TV and movies, use lots of<br/>\n&quot;colorful&quot; language as they say and he basically tunes it out. Several<br/>\nyears ago, DS was just being downright rude to DH and we couldn&#39;t figure<br/>\nout why. So, DS and I went out on a &#39;date&#39; to be by ourselves and talk.<br/>\nTurned out that DS had picked up a message that grownups can cuss but<br/>\nkids can&#39;t, so when DH let out a D**n or S**t (** for the spam blockers)<br/>\nor whatever, it upset DS. We discussed it, how some people are indeed<br/>\noffended when kids say certain things, how it made no sense to have a<br/>\ndouble standard like that (since we don&#39;t/didn&#39;t have one on that or<br/>\nanything else really).

We like to<br/>\nwatch lots of British TV (Monty Python, Dr. Who, Torchwood, Red Dwarf)<br/>\nand there is quite a vocabulary there - we might discuss a new word that<br/>\npops up, what it refers to, etc and we had an interesting discussion the<br/>\nother night based on words for &quot;vomit&quot; and why they are used and how<br/>\nalternate words for certain things tell about the culture that uses them<br/>\n(such as the Victorian reticence to use the word &quot;leg&quot; when referring to<br/>\na woman&#39;s lower extremities - they used &quot;limb&quot; if they absolutely had to<br/>\nrefer to it, which DS thought was silly since arms are also limbs, as if<br/>\nwomen simply floated about on a cushion of air). DS is 11 now and the<br/>\noccasional S**t or D**n will pop out (like when he gets killed for the<br/>\n16th time on a level) but generally speaking we&#39;re not a &quot;salty&quot; bunch<br/>\n(which is good because DH is on meds for hypertension lol).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

I&#39;m new here and am exploring unschooling as an option for my  <br/>\n2 y/o son, so I don&#39;t have an older kid I can talk about  <br/>\nspecifically.  But I can give my perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like the issue is not swearing per say (at least with the  <br/>\nfriends) but hypocrisy.  I think it&#39;s totally uncool for them to  <br/>\npunish your son for doing the same thing those particular kids have  <br/>\npreviously participated in.  I think it&#39;s great that your son has the  <br/>\ngift of being able to be honest about who he is in all arenas of his  <br/>\nlife instead of feeling like he has to be one thing for a certain  <br/>\ngroup of people but another for his parents.  I say swear away.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for swearing itself, I personally think there is a time and place  <br/>\nfor profanity.  I think that overuse of profanity is both lazy and  <br/>\ncrude when it comes to our use of  language, and this is something  <br/>\nthat our children have to come to on their own terms with.  It&#39;s our  <br/>\njob to teach when and where profanity is appropriate, and how our  <br/>\nwords effect others.  A &quot;sh*t&quot; when stubbing a toe is appropriate.   <br/>\nDropping the f-bomb as every other word is perhaps less appropriate.   <br/>\nBeing a young person is all about extremes and one of those extremes  <br/>\nis exploring language and its power.  Profanity provides power, but so  <br/>\ndoes a well thought out argument, or a concisely written letter to the  <br/>\neditor.  The goal is that they will learn when one can use profanity  <br/>\nand when one best keep one&#39;s mouth shutty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your ex-husband, I don&#39;t have any insight on that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, my mouth is the saltiest at work, but never around my manager.<br/>\n<br/>\nSacha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 24, 2009, at 4:35 PM, The Coffee Goddess wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;For us it really depends on the situation.

And there were a LOT of  <br/>\n&gt; them--it was WONDERFUL!  I tried to get one of my son&#39;s local friend  <br/>\n&gt; to join the group, although she was shy...She finally was warming up  <br/>\n&gt; when her very conservative dad jumped in, grabbed her, and dragged  <br/>\n&gt; her off with some off handed comment about how &quot;It&#39;s time for *us*  <br/>\n&gt; to do MATH!&quot; and they went home...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, his friends, when they are around him, *do* use colorful  <br/>\n&gt; language.

We live in a society that has expectations, rules and mores. We need to work within those principles while we are in that society.<br/>\nJust my $.03~~<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree. One of my talks is about &quot;Freedom vs. License&quot;. I discuss the use of the word &quot;freedom&quot; and go on to explain that I like the word &quot;liberty&quot; better....the ability to do what one chooses as long as it doesn&#39;t harm another. Cussing doesn&#39;t cause any physical harm, but it can really, deeply bother some people because of how they were raised/what they believe etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nI work within those restraints of society every day. I know many, many people who have different ideas than I do and it&#39;s not my job to change their minds. Other people have just as much right to live their lives the way they choose and expect me to honor that, just as they can respect my different choices. There are many times I might choose to ignore their sensitivities (if someone thought it was good/right to spank my child) but the overriding thought is about honoring differences and doing the least amount of harm. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe least harmful thing in my opinion is to simply lay off the cussing around certain people. Good skill to learn if one is going to communicate effectively in our society. Lay a few of those words on a potential employer and I&#39;ll be they&#39;ll give the job to someone else, even at a trendy place where pink hair and edgy clothes are considered a plus! <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nradicalunschooling.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: swearing...","postDate":"1245896662","msgId":40601,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgxdW40bSt0YTV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxMzkyNi4yNzEyNi5xbUB3ZWIzNjkwNS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40600,"nextInTopic":40602,"prevInTime":40600,"nextInTime":40602,"topicId":40589,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~But anyway, what do you all do with swearing and friend who have a problem with it?

And any other comments for this situtaion or others similar?~~<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s not considered acceptable by most of society and children (especially at that age) should be made aware of that. I wouldn&#39;t swear in front of my grandmother, who would be offended and I inform my children of situations where it wouldn&#39;t be acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the work place it is highly unacceptable (I work retail and any job in public work it is usually frowned upon and even a reason for dismissal or being written up) so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a great idea to say &quot;cursing is fine with me, so do what you want&quot;. We live in a society full of people with different ideas. I think it&#39;s useful to choose carefully when our ideals conflict with someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not hurting my ideals or beliefs to stop cussing for certain situations. I think it helps grease the wheels of society for people to be aware of what can offend and avoid those things IF it doesn&#39;t conflict with your own inner guidance. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s good for a child to be aware of what might bother a parent too. My children know that their Dad can&#39;t STAND cussing. I remind Jalen of that fact. It doesn&#39;t help their relationship for him to ignore that information....though it slips out because he&#39;s eight and still figuring out when/where it&#39;s appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround friends that have a problem with it, one should be more sensitive/aware. It&#39;s not a great thing to encourage &quot;I&#39;ll do what I want regardless of how other feel&quot;. It&#39;s not hurting a childs ability to be-who-they-are or diminish their ability to express themselves to put cussing on hold for the sake of another human.

Alot. I&#39;ve got a very filthy mouth ;o) <br/>\nThat said, I have frequently talked with my kids about appropriate times and places to swear. While I think that your son&#39;s friends not talking to him for half an hour is pretty mean, I also think that it is kind and respectful of other people&#39;s feelings to use different language around them. It IS rude to go to someone&#39;s house and do things they don&#39;t want done. Just because we are freer and more open doesn&#39;t mean that everyone we spend time with has to be that way too. They get to choose the principles their family lives by just as we get to choose our principles. Sometimes, in order for the kids to remember when it is or isn&#39;t appropriate, I give them a little reminder, &quot;Time and place, Hon.&quot; <br/>\nOn the occasions that a swear word has popped out without thought, the kids that object to it have said as much, and my kids have respected that. Yes, I believe they are just words, and should be no big deal, but I don&#39;t have to force others to be uncomfortable just because I feel that way. What is it that Ren says? One person&#39;s rights end where another&#39;s begins? <br/>\nUnschooling is not a free-for-all where anything goes. We live in a society that has expectations, rules and mores. We need to work within those principles while we are in that society. <br/>\nJust my $.03 <br/>\n<br/>\nElissa, Unschooling Momma to Emily 15, and Max 9.

This is something your son will need to assess for himself and decide whether he is comfortable with the consequences from others outside the home as that is their choice also.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope I dont get shotdown for saying this, as I am very new and as I said Id love to hear from the experienced members as I am learning so much everyday from you all :D<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\n¸.·´ .·-:¦:-<br/>\n((¸¸.·´Camille .·´-:¦:- ~<br/>\n     -:¦:-¸¸.·´*<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: The Coffee Goddess <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, June 25, 2009 10:02 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] swearing...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am a life-long unschooler and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever asked a question here, but I have a situation I would like to hear other&#39;s thoughts on...<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My son is a very preocicous child, and he&#39;s 11, but has friends aged 12-15 mostly--he&#39;s the kid with bleached blonde and pink hair and wears eyeliner.

I&#39;m sorry for your son,  <br/>\nfor feeling upset, that really does feel crummy. However, his friends  <br/>\nobviously don&#39;t like cursing, and if you choose a lifestyle that  <br/>\nmakes others uncomfortable, you can&#39;t be surprised if those others  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to spend time with you. As you said, those probably aren&#39;t  <br/>\nthe friends he wants. Can I point out that he wants his friends to  <br/>\naccept him as a cursing person, but he isn&#39;t willing to tone it down  <br/>\nto help them feel more comfortable?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind cursing, personally, but if it&#39;s contrived for the sole  <br/>\npurpose of being &#39;cool&#39;, it really does start to bother me. My  <br/>\nhusband does not curse at all, and is extremely uncomfortable with  <br/>\nit. He won&#39;t shun someone who does it, but he doesn&#39;t like it at all.  <br/>\nMy kids will use a word or two if they are feeling strong emotions,  <br/>\nbut honestly don&#39;t understand why anyone would use a curse every  <br/>\nother word to make a point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really about what he wants. If he wants to pick something  <br/>\nslightly less offensive and can use that, more power to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Joshua, Breanna, Emily, Rachel, Samuel, Daniel, Avari, and  <br/>\nbaby Nathan!<br/>\nWife to Zane<br/>\n<br/>\nblog me at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://startlinglives.blogspot.com/\">http://startlinglives.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://startlinglives365.blogspot.com\">http://startlinglives365.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 24, 2009, at 5:02 PM, The Coffee Goddess wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am a life-long unschooler and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever asked a  <br/>\n&gt; question here, but I have a situation I would like to hear other&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; thoughts on...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son is a very preocicous child, and he&#39;s 11, but has friends  <br/>\n&gt; aged 12-15 mostly--he&#39;s the kid with bleached blonde and pink hair  <br/>\n&gt; and wears eyeliner.
