One of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-111019813\">I have started a blog on my Asperger/ Hyperlexic son&#39;s journey <br/>\ntowards deschooling/ unschooling via his PlayStation and his <br/>\nobsession with the internet. One of my first deschooling/ unschooling <br/>\ndilemma was his obsession with his PS2 and Lego Star Wars. But yet <br/>\none of the most daring decision I&#39;ve ever made in our very new <br/>\nunschooling life was to allow my 7 yr old to play with the <br/>\ncontroversial Grand Theft Auto. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now we have come out the other end, in one piece! My son is no <br/>\nmore violent than any 7 yrs old watching Scooby Doo. And <br/>\ninterestingly he&#39;s switched from ultra violent Grand Theft Auto to <br/>\nsofty-cutie Disney Toon Town online community game! And somehow, all <br/>\nthese PS2 playing and online gaming is culminating into his <br/>\nunderstanding of numbers and maths. Infact, his obsession with the <br/>\nPS2 and the internet is supporting his learning in many ways.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter much consideration, I&#39;m thinking perhaps my experience might <br/>\noffer some comfort or ideas to some unschooling parent with video <br/>\ngame issues. Hence I&#39;m offering the link to my blog, with good faith <br/>\nand good intention. I am not promoting or preaching any unschooling <br/>\nmethods. These blogs is purely a log of my thoughts on our <br/>\nunschooling progress, for my own benefit, as some of the contents is <br/>\nobviously not very unschooling, please bear in mind that <br/>\nmy &quot;schooled&quot; brain is stll in the process of de-schooling. So I <br/>\nwould appreciate it if anyone do read my blog, to only leave positive <br/>\nor helpful response or nothing at all. If you do have any <br/>\ndisagreement with my method of parenting/ unschooling, pls do keep it <br/>\nto yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mamagecko.blogspot.com\">http://mamagecko.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSharonC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27110,"nextTopicId":27119}}
