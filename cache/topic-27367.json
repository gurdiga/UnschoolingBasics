We have lots of animals 7 cats, 2 birds ,6 chooks, an axolotal fish, and 4 skinks. all animals are joshuas except the cats are my babies.<br/>\n <br/>\nAfter our ERO visit, I lost the fun in doing homeschooling.Ive since read a bit of information regarding unscholing and Id like to get to know anyone who does unschooling, and better still, if theres anyone who lives near me ,it would be great to meat. we live in the far north in Kaitaia, (NZ) we have been blessed with the oppertunity to rent a house which is surounded by a pretty stream and native bush.unfortunetly I dont drive so living out in the country does have its bad points with having to rely on people.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boy joshua loves his playstaion and as a way of getting over our ERO visit I alowed him to play it when he wanted and then I sudenly realised that he was learning to read better through something that interested him, Joshua knows what sort of games that I dont like him to play and hes very good, he knows his limits.<br/>\nHe enjoys computer even though his writing skills are not the best, thats when Im there to help. Hes just recently joined the BEBO chat group on computer, I wasnt sure at first if it was the right thing, but now Ive come to see that hes getting to know friends. I do however check up once in a while to supervise what contents is coming through or going out. <br/>\nLately weve been given an electric Jigsaw which josh has been using flat out. cutting wood and building bird boxes, <br/>\nAs a solo mum Ive found it very hard having to forfull the position of a fathers guidance, (ohh for the male support for josh. but we make do). Im entering into a new relationship with a guy thats not supoortive of homeschooling /unschooling and weve had our heated discussions. (YUK! YUK! YUK!) but I can see that hes learning and like me we find it hard to stand up for our beleifs with homeschooling, particuly with those judgementle people who comment about the situation without knowing anything, Im afraid I wear my heeart on my sleeve and take critism deeply. A major lesson I need to build on. Im hoping that through some support I will gain the knowledge to be a confident teacher for my son, and with the wisdom that I learn, then just maybe I can encourage my new boyfriend to accept and support our way of life.<br/>\nHoping to hear back from those willing to giude and support us.<br/>\nfrom Dawn and Joshua Booth  :-) <br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
