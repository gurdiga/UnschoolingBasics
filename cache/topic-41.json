I think it&#39;d be <br/>\na setup almost guaranteed to prompt resentment directed not only toward the <br/>\nmother but also toward the younger child, affecting their relationship for life. <br/>\nI can easily imagine the teen feeling she was being punished for not wanting <br/>\nto join in this &quot;great&quot; new experiment her mother is engaged in. Ya know? As <br/>\nwell as the obvious feelings of being loved and cared for less than the younger <br/>\nchild.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think this is anywhere near the same as doing cool things with the <br/>\nunschooled kids while the schooled kid is in school. <br/>\n<br/>\n14 can be a really tough age to be. I&#39;d not add to the angst myself without <br/>\nbeing really really really sure it would all be for the best for everyone <br/>\ninvolved. This is so tenative an idea I personally would go very very VERY slowly <br/>\nat checking it out, thinking about it, making friends via email in the area. <br/>\nFour years might be a long time but they could seem even longer if you&#39;re living <br/>\nwith a resentful teen. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I&#39;d spend a good part of the next school vacation there if <br/>\nI could, especially if I could manage to not set it up as pressuring the teen <br/>\nto see how great it would be, but just as a vacation and checking it out for <br/>\neveryone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis probably sounds harsh.

His choice. But I am learning not to allow his choice hinder the opportunities out there for my younger two at home either. We do as much as we can when he is with us , but lets face it - we do some pretty cool stuff in the name of &#39;school&#39; here, lol.

I also really <br/>\nknow now from experiencing it again and again that teaching her is the <br/>\nwrong thing to do. It kills the fun for her every time. So thanks for <br/>\nyour encouragement to help me take the plunge.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question re coming to a consensus in the family. I want to <br/>\nmove to another part of NZ to where I believe is a bigger hs group with <br/>\nhopefully more unschoolers (here are none). Also, I think we would find <br/>\nmore friends for my dd to play with and I might find a few more for <br/>\nmyself. My dh is open to the idea although he is apprehensive about <br/>\nteaching in a new school (he&#39;s a high school teacher, but don&#39;t judge <br/>\nhim by that) but willing to take the risk. My 14yo dd however doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to move at all. She says that it will take ages finding new <br/>\nfriends, if she&#39;d find any at all and she is happy here. She attends <br/>\nhigh school and likes it for the social life. She doesn&#39;t want to home <br/>\nschool. She&#39;ll finish school in 4 yrs.
