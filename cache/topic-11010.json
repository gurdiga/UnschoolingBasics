Fades slowly (depending on how porous your hair<br/>\nis) and allows you to play with other colors. I found that touching<br/>\nmine up every 2-3 weeks worked best, though I still had some blue<br/>\nafter a month this last time, when I cut it all off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pinks and greens fade pretty quick, the bright blue stays better. <br/>\nGet a few colors and play around! It&#39;s only around $7 at Sally&#39;s<br/>\nBeauty Supply and I think $8ish at Hot Topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those parents and kids that don&#39;t want semi-permamanent, there is<br/>\nhair mascara and hair spray paint. Both wash out easily. We keep a<br/>\nbasket of the hair spray paint for when inspiration hits. You can see<br/>\nSierra and Jalen&#39;s colors from last week at my blog, under the &quot;I will<br/>\nsing glory in the lowest....&quot; post.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://radicalunschooling.blogspot.com/\">http://radicalunschooling.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n(Thanks for the pics Diana).<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10979,"nextTopicId":11006}}
