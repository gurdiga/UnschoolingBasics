Did you have a conversation with your kids about your new outlook or did you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1308557768\">&quot;If you have time, could you talk more about that transition, what <br/>\nit looked<br/>\nlike? Did you have a conversation with your kids about your new <br/>\noutlook or did<br/>\nyou just jump in and do it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe pretty much jumped in and did it. But it WAS a slower transition <br/>\nfor us. <br/>\nWe had leaned towards a relaxed/eclectic style for many years. <br/>\nHaving read Holt back in &#39;95/&#39;96,you&#39;d think I would have gotten it <br/>\na lot sooner! Unschooling sounded ideal, but I just hadn&#39;t made that <br/>\nparadigm shift to see the learning in everything. I thought my son <br/>\nneeded some pushing. I did a lot of damage, but less than school <br/>\nwould have since he was free to explore the world for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn early 2000, I started reading at unschooling.com and just loved <br/>\nwhat I read. We relaxed even more, then in August of 2000, my dh and <br/>\nI separated. I was pregnant with babsy #4 and decided this was my <br/>\nmoment to totally LET GO. We lived life. We quit worrying about <br/>\nmath, or writing and just lived together. I still had my chore lists <br/>\nand bedtimes and tv limits, though I wasn&#39;t a nazi about it (well, <br/>\nexcept for the tv thing).<br/>\nDh and I reconciled in Jan. of 2001, and he moved back in February. <br/>\nHe is a much more structured/organized person than I, so he wanted <br/>\nto make some changes when he moved back in. We got Nazi-like about <br/>\nsome things. It was awful.<br/>\nI was reading enough by then to really question the sanity of <br/>\neverything we were doing and finally got to the point where I said <br/>\nNO MORE. I told him that if he wanted to damage his relationship <br/>\nwith his children, I couldn&#39;t stop him, but I was NOT willing to be <br/>\nan aid.<br/>\nIt took a while for me to really understand, deep down. But I just <br/>\nkept struggling my way through all of it. Once in a while,I&#39;d have a <br/>\nregression and gripe at the kids about too much tv or video games, <br/>\nthat was in 2001. But somewhere in that year, I think May or <br/>\nJuneish, I quit worrying. Once we embraced ALL of life as learning, <br/>\nonce I realized my children were perfectly capable of making their <br/>\nown decisions and that acting as their partner really worked...then, <br/>\nand only then, did unschooling unfold the way I&#39;d read about.<br/>\nVoila!! We&#39;d done it!:)<br/>\nI was a lot slower than others here....my stubborn brain was holding <br/>\nonto that which it was familiar with, school. No longer.<br/>\nI am their allie now, not the enemy. No longer are there struggles <br/>\nabout trying to make them do things they don&#39;t want to do, our house <br/>\nis more peaceful, more joyful than I could have imagined.<br/>\nUnschooling was the road to healing for us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4083,"nextTopicId":4103}}
