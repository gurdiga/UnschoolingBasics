Sometime in the middle of the night last night, I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1086565599\">I have been brainstorming and trying to figure out ways to keep sane<br/>\nwith my own personal chore dilemma.  Sometime in the middle of the<br/>\nnight last night, I suddenly remembered that I had already figured<br/>\nthis out once before!  When we lived in Columbia, my therapist<br/>\nsuggested I hire help to clean my house.  As someone already<br/>\nmentioned, paying someone to clean house for us can seem like quite a<br/>\nchunk of money to some of us.  I can easily spend the $40.00 that was<br/>\nmentioned on fast food in a week and not blink twice.  It&#39;s just how<br/>\nwe rationalize it.  It&#39;s food, we have to eat, and I don&#39;t keep a<br/>\nclean kitchen,  nor do I cook often.  Nor do I grocery shop often. <br/>\nHa!  I also see the flip side of the coin though, where if I did keep<br/>\na clean kitchen, it&#39;d be much easier to cook meals, pack food for<br/>\noutings, etc.  So, since that is the side of the coin I want to be on,<br/>\nI need to get help cleaning!  The solution:  Cleaning Playdates.  When<br/>\nI lived in Columbia, a friend and I took turns helping the other clean<br/>\nup.  I&#39;d bring my kids to her place and they&#39;d hang out while we<br/>\ncleaned up.  She&#39;d pick an area she wanted to work on before I got<br/>\nthere and we&#39;d plow through it till it was done.  Usually, since the<br/>\nkids got along so well, we ended up getting much more done than we<br/>\nplanned for.  Then the next week, she&#39;d bring her kids to my place and<br/>\nwe&#39;d do the same thing.  When I told my Mother in Law all about this<br/>\nbright idea of mine, she said that&#39;s nothing new!  She and a good<br/>\nfriend used to live across the street from each other and they helped<br/>\neach other daily!  They&#39;d get one house cleaned and dinner in the<br/>\ncrock pot, and then go to the other one and do the same.  Anyway, I&#39;ve<br/>\ngot a Cleaning Playdate request out on both the local Yahoo lists I&#39;m<br/>\non and just wanted to share in case anyone else could benefit from this.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36907,"nextTopicId":36839}}
