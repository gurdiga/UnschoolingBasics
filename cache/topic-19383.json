I would have loved to be more<br/>\nresponsive, but our computer crashed so we were offline for awhile. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had wanted to get some examples of concrete things to do that others had<br/>\ntried for calming down, perhaps some specific books about sleeping, etc to<br/>\nrecommend . Of course, there is always getting a snack, bath, teeth, and<br/>\nbooks. But since they had already come to associate those things with &quot;bed<br/>\ntime,&quot; I was looking for neutral activities and well thought out guidelines<br/>\nso to speak. Now that I&#39;m a bit more rested, it&#39;s plain to see that I didn&#39;t<br/>\ndo enough research first. I had read Unprocessed Child and went a little<br/>\ngung ho. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI also didn&#39;t paint the whole picture, because there were other factors as<br/>\nwell, of course. My 3 yo would go to bed, although she stayed up longer than<br/>\nbefore. But my son (almost 5) did not want to go to bed at all. I was<br/>\ntalking about listening to our bodies and how they tell us when we are<br/>\ntired. I figured maybe it was because he has had an issue with not being<br/>\nable to do things his big sister can, and he just wanted to experience the<br/>\npower of staying up. So I let him experience that but it was taking a toll<br/>\non all of us. My oldest (10) is used to time with me after the younger ones<br/>\nwhen to sleep, so she was waiting up longer than usual. So I still had to<br/>\nget up early and the only rested one was my 3 yo. (That&#39;s why my house was<br/>\nmessed up, I put all my attention on staying with them to prevent battles<br/>\nfrom breaking out.) Then there is my husband. He agrees with me about the<br/>\nprinciples and concepts, but hasn&#39;t read much about unschooling lifestyle.<br/>\nAnd he was baffled and tired. I have to get him credit though, he has been a<br/>\ntrooper considering he knew less of what to expect than I did!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we did have to tell my son, it is time to go to sleep so we can rest well<br/>\nand wake up happy. That we needed more sleep and that&#39;s why we were cranky,<br/>\netc. He has opened up more to reading books; he had just wanted to watch tv.<br/>\nSo we live and learn and are journeying. Thanks for helping us on our<br/>\njourney!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nStaci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] new and grasping to hold focus","postDate":"1165865312","msgId":19631,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOEVCNzFBREJGODE0Ri05OUMtREEyQEZXTS1NNDIuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYxMTI4MDcwOTQ0LlZTUUM0MjI2LmZlZDFybW10YW8xMi5jb3gubmV0QGZlZDFybWltcG8wMi5jb3gubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYxMTI4MDcwOTQ0LlZTUUM0MjI2LmZlZDFybW10YW8xMi5jb3gubmV0QGZlZDFybWltcG8wMi5jb3gubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":19455,"nextInTopic":19781,"prevInTime":19630,"nextInTime":19632,"topicId":19383,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It also means he&#39;s more likely to be  <br/>\ngrumpy and not want to do things with them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk about their needs too and how the needs are clashing. Than talk  <br/>\nabout solutions, especially solutions that help kids deal with the  <br/>\nneed to be wound up at night. Don&#39;t think in terms of what to do (eg,  <br/>\nwhat punishment to mete out) when someone is loud.

Assume they&#39;re just forgetting. Assume they&#39;ve just  <br/>\nbeen overwhelmed by something inside that needs to burst out. Talk  <br/>\nabout ways to *prevent* the need to be restless.

I also have work that I can juggle <br/>\naround my kid, most of the time - something that I can see being <br/>\nmore of a challenge with childcare. <br/>\n<br/>\nCompassion is good - be sure to have some for yourself! This is a <br/>\nBig Transition. Maybe it was too much at once for the little ones - <br/>\nbut going back might undermine trust. So look for ways to help them <br/>\nfigure out what their needs are. Offer them opportunities to snuggle <br/>\nor some other quiet activity when you can see they are getting <br/>\ntired. Notice what they are eating, too - Mo gets &quot;bouncy&quot; about an <br/>\nhour after having protein, so I don&#39;t offer her any later in the <br/>\nevening. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, dss Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":251838049,"authorName":"Staci","from":"&quot;Staci&quot; &lt;staci444@...&gt;","profile":"home2stayandplay","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"new and grasping to hold focus","postDate":"1164697779","msgId":19383,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYxMTI4MDcwOTQ0LlZTUUM0MjI2LmZlZDFybW10YW8xMi5jb3gubmV0QGZlZDFybWltcG8wMi5jb3gubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19406,"prevInTime":19382,"nextInTime":19384,"topicId":19383,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pardon me if this is choppy, I m exhausted but I have been wanting to post for days now!

I have mostly been a SAHM since<br/>\nmotherhood. Always wanted to home school because I thought kids should have<br/>\na choice about what they learned about when I was a kid. The opportunity<br/>\ncame when my oldest was in 3rd grade. I had spent a lot of time researching<br/>\nabout it and was SO excited to learn about US! It complemented my spiritual<br/>\njourney and my search for the meaning of life.  :-)   Anyhoo, we did<br/>\ndeschooling for a semester but she went back to PS when my husband and I<br/>\nseparated for a year. I became a licensed child care provider while we were<br/>\nseparated since I love kids and I could stay home with mine. I still am and<br/>\nwas planning on doing it in a more US way but now I am starting to think it<br/>\nwill take away more from my family than it will give them. Still in limbo<br/>\nabout that one. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Challenge<br/>\n<br/>\nNow my oldest is out of school again (parents back together) and we are<br/>\nlooking at how to implement the US principles in all areas of our lives. We<br/>\ndecided to eliminate bedtimes and our life has been turned upside down; I am<br/>\nso tired I can&#39;t think straight and the house is in disarray.  Sometimes<br/>\nfinding clothes to wear is an ordeal. I feel so ignorant. I have read so<br/>\nmuch about parenting and been involved in early childhood education and I am<br/>\nnot always sure what feels right anymore! I know there is no right way to do<br/>\nthis, but I do know there is a right way to do it for each of my kids.  I<br/>\nfeel lost about everything!! Dang, it was so much easier reading what the<br/>\nexperts had to say and taking what felt right:-) Not that I can&#39;t use any of<br/>\nthat info, however, this is absolutely going out on a limb. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIronically, I feel like I am being a worse parent. Did I initiate too much<br/>\nall at once for my younger ones? Are they confused without a routine? All<br/>\nthe kids are acting more aggressively because we are all so tired. Thus, I<br/>\nam not exactly in a state to be much of a role model these days. I&#39;m<br/>\npracticing compassion for us all at best, and letting the guilt pass through<br/>\nme at worst. I&#39;m most concerned about my young ones.  I need hope and to<br/>\nfocus on what is possible rather than what is in front of me right now. I&#39;d<br/>\nlove to hear about any tips for helping this transition go more smoothly. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for being there! <br/>\n<br/>\nStaci<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19709,"nextTopicId":19779}}
