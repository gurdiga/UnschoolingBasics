My son gets VERY <br/>\nfocused on one thing too. It&#39;s been Harry Potter, YuGiOh, Pokemon <br/>\nlately but there&#39;s usually always something. I understand your <br/>\nconcern. We have SO many things to worry about as mothers but I <br/>\nthink this is one that if you can take a deep breath and let go, <br/>\nit&#39;d be a good one to do this for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can be a bit negative at times~ flaw I&#39;m working on! But I try to <br/>\nlook at situations that seem pretty <br/>\ntense/negative/worrysome/disasterous and say.. &quot;what am I thankful <br/>\nfor?&quot; This is a good situation to use this tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, doctors tend to come from very &#39;conventional&#39; thinking and I&#39;d <br/>\ntake your doctor&#39;s opinion with a grain of salt, if you can. He&#39;s <br/>\nnot realizing what a dynamic, amazing boy your son is FIRST, even if <br/>\nhis interests can be intense at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to say I saw your post and it touched me and helped me, <br/>\nyet again, to look at my son and see all the wonderful things about <br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarm regards<br/>\nTonya<br/>\nProud mama to<br/>\nChristian 5-30-95<br/>\nRory 6-9-99<br/>\nAlannah 6-18-03</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13097,"nextTopicId":13039}}
