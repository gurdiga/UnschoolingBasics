Woo!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my kids are going to wash their hair, they don&#39;t like having as <br/>\nmuch water in the tub as they would if they weren&#39;t washing their <br/>\nhair.  That&#39;s not something I would have ever thought of, but they <br/>\nboth dislike washing their hair in a really deep tub of water.  Our <br/>\nsolution is to let them play in deep water and then drain water out <br/>\nto a satisfactory level when they are ready to wash their hair and <br/>\nget out.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":248268539,"authorName":"Elissa Jill Cleaveland","from":"&quot;Elissa Jill Cleaveland&quot; &lt;MystikMomma@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] The tub","postDate":"1150463790","msgId":14627,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYTgwMWM2OTE0NyQxNWQwZDE3MCQwMWZlYThjMEBzcXVpZD4=","referencesHeader":"PGU2dWE0YSsyNmJrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":14624,"nextInTopic":14631,"prevInTime":14626,"nextInTime":14628,"topicId":14624,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What ever happened to those bath tub crayons or paints that were soap?
