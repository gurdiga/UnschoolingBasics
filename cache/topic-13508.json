DD was in PS from K-3.  anyhow, the rule of thumb is one<br/>\nmonth deschooling for every year in PS... all this time I&#39;ve been pretty<br/>\nmuch letting her do whatever... and she&#39;s been anti-book/anti-library this<br/>\nwhole time...  today in the car on the way to church my DD starts talking<br/>\nabout the sign-language she knows and we talked a bit about it and I said I<br/>\ncould probably find some charts on the internet for her and she said &quot;we<br/>\ncould go to the library to get a book about it... then I could talk to<br/>\npeople who know sign-language.&quot; \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nit was such a cool moment because it was all her... I didn&#39;t do a thing to<br/>\nbring this conversation or idea on.  so as I was thinking about it I<br/>\nrealized that it&#39;s been about as many months as years as she was in PS...<br/>\nand she&#39;s now pursuing interests beyond tv/video games 24/7 (though... don&#39;t<br/>\nget me wrong... I have no problems with this 24/7)... it&#39;s just cool to see<br/>\nher want to pursue an interest and an interest that I had no idea she had. <br/>\n:)\r<br/>\n~*~*~\r<br/>\nLesa\r<br/>\nLIFE Academy\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net\">http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net</a>\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://qtpiecraftsandthings.etsy.com\">http://qtpiecraftsandthings.etsy.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13503,"nextTopicId":13483}}
