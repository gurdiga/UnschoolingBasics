I would go so far as to say he <br/>\nstruggled with it, because other children aren&#39;t as forgiving as adults when a child <br/>\ncontinues on in his interests. They don&#39;t want to hear someone else go on and on without <br/>\nconsideration to their POV. So he lost a lot of potential friends, and got his feelings hurt <br/>\nwhen people walked away from him. He really could not stop talking about his interest <br/>\nlong enough to say &#39;Why are you walking away?&quot;  He was very depressed because he <br/>\nwanted friends and no children wanted him. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have always accepted his interests and we talk about them. I have done research and <br/>\nread books so I know what he&#39;s talking about (even more difficult now that he&#39;s 12 and <br/>\nbypassed me in all ways technical) So he&#39;s learned the back-and-forth within his interests. <br/>\nWhen he was about seven or eight, he was capable of dealing with me making connecting <br/>\ncomments like &quot;Oh, this is kind of like in MY hobby, when we do this&quot; (before then, any <br/>\ncomment offtopic of his interest was ignored or sparked a severe violent meltdown). By me <br/>\nmodeling how to ask questions and be interested, he did learn how to do that. I did say to <br/>\nhim &quot;Sometimes people want you to be interested in their stuff too, it makes for better <br/>\nconversation&quot; We actually played games in how things are connected, because his brain <br/>\ndidn&#39;t see connections like &quot;How is this pen and this cap connected? The cap goes on the <br/>\npen.&quot; He couldn&#39;t do that at all, and if you can&#39;t connect a physical thing like that, how can <br/>\nyou connect concepts like, if I&#39;m talking about cars to a barber while getting my hair cut, <br/>\nwhat are some things HE might know? Could I ask him what kind of car he drives?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this make sense? When you talk about it happening naturally, I think natural is so <br/>\nvaried, from person to person. With my other kids, they learned conversation skills very <br/>\nearly and very well, without any help. Josh really really needed help to get those fine tuned <br/>\nskills. And my Breanna, who has autism, needs LOTS of practice to get the fundamentals <br/>\nof communication down, just asking for help is a hardship.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jamieminnis&quot; &lt;jamieminnis@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;     My oldest is of the most concern.

And they are filled, not only with detail, but with such excitement <br/>\nover the subject matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually a couple of weeks ago I met a really nice boy who talked to me <br/>\nabout Warhammer for about half an hour. Nothing else, just Warhammer. And it <br/>\nwas brilliant, he told me about the stats and some specific battles he&#39;d <br/>\nbeen in with a mutual friend. I could imagine the battle and, more than <br/>\nthat, he could see all of these characters as he spoke, and his face was <br/>\nalight with excitement<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he got up to go do something else I said to his mother &quot;Wow, that was <br/>\nwonderful.&quot; and she said &quot;It&#39;s hard to believe he wouldn&#39;t talk to people a <br/>\nyear and a half ago.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 3 1/2 and 4 3/4 I wouldn&#39;t expect anyone to think outside of their own <br/>\ninterests. At 38 I still like to talk about my interests and, while I can <br/>\nbecome interested in many things, certain subjects like soccer or cricket or <br/>\nhow well someone&#39;s child is doing in school, can often leave me cold. <br/>\nTalking about what interests you is really the best part of conversation, <br/>\nand as his interests begin to incorporate other things so will his <br/>\nconversations. Maybe you should just figure out ways to like what he&#39;s <br/>\ntalking about more &lt;g&gt;. And heck knights and space are pretty amazing topics <br/>\nof conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":206695648,"authorName":"jamieminnis","from":"&quot;jamieminnis&quot; &lt;jamieminnis@...&gt;","profile":"jamieminnis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"New to the group with a question","postDate":"1171659209","msgId":21470,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVyNTVrOSs1dTZ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21481,"prevInTime":21469,"nextInTime":21472,"topicId":21470,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I am new to this group and new to the whole concept of unschooling.
