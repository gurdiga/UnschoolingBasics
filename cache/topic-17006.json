Sometimes <br/>\nlittle kids need mom to hold them for five or ten or thirty minutes. <br/>\nSometimes nursing and a five minute snooze is all they need and they&#39;re good <br/>\nfor a couple more hours.

I <br/>\npersonally find it very irritating when other people tell me how I feel. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nAs she gets older it might help her if you make an observation like,  &quot;you <br/>\nseem tired&quot; or if you ask if she might be tired,  but she is still very <br/>\nyoung and I think you won&#39;t help her awareness by pointing these things out <br/>\nnow.

Your daughter is changing and growing and <br/>\nwhat will help her today might not help in two months.  If the goal is to <br/>\nhelp her get to sleep and get the amount of sleep she needs you will have to <br/>\nbe the one watching her cues so that early on you can offer things that will <br/>\nease her toward sleep.

I don&#39;t think it is that I have been saying  <br/>\n&quot;yes&quot; too much and not taking into account my own needs, because I  <br/>\nhave, when I really needed it, and always kindly and as respectful as  <br/>\nI can and I found that since she has been given freedom, she is so  <br/>\ngrateful that she helps more often than she did before and she  <br/>\naccepts real &quot;nos&quot; without whining.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there is one need of ours which doesn&#39;t seem to be compatible  <br/>\nwith unschooling. That is relaxing without children (or with, but  <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t seem to work) and watching/doing things for &quot;adults&quot;.  <br/>\nFormerly,  when the children where in bed, at *8.00 pm* :-) we had  <br/>\nfour hours for *just us*. We would watch movies, relax, talk, email,  <br/>\nbathe together etc. After a long day of work and attention to our  <br/>\nchildren we&#39;d be exhausted and could relax.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we have no bedtimes. The first days she went to bed at 3, 4 in  <br/>\nthe morning, we were already in bed :-) I really want her to have  <br/>\nthat freedom and I don&#39;t mind at all this part of the fact. BUT *we*  <br/>\nas a couple don&#39;t seem to have any peace at all. We haven&#39;t relaxed  <br/>\nsince monday, I&#39;m extremely exhausted, headache since yesterday, we  <br/>\nhavne&#39;t even been able to talk about unschooling or anything in  <br/>\nrelaxed mode to process all of this. I thought I was only lacking  <br/>\nsleep but the last two days I wanted to go to bed early, and at 22:00  <br/>\nI said I wanted to go to bed, and THEN *suddenly* she wanted to a  <br/>\nmillion things: endless cuddling (I read somewhere we shouldn&#39;t let  <br/>\ngo off first), talking, show me something, show me another thing etc  <br/>\netc... well yesterday I managed to go to bed anyway early (for my  <br/>\nstandarts), but I still feel extremely exhausted. I dunno how to meet  <br/>\nthis need because I really just need NOBODY around me asking  <br/>\nquestions, making me do things etc. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can I do? Is it unschooling if we tell her she can play or do  <br/>\nwhatever meanwhile, but we need our time in the evenings to watch  <br/>\nsomethign and relax? or being alone? At least *sometimes* I&#39;m not  <br/>\neven asking for EVERY evening, but just when we feel the urge? I  <br/>\nguess not! So yesterday we tried watching TV anyway (to have our  <br/>\nneeds and passions respected as well) and then DS (1 yr) was crawling  <br/>\nall over us all the time (he kind of understood we are unschooling as  <br/>\nwell ;-) and doesn&#39;t want to sleep at 8 either), and DD (7yr) started  <br/>\njumping around, said a million things in between, asked questions  <br/>\n(which we answered), said it was boring etc etc. So we kind of didn&#39;t  <br/>\nrelax at all :-) And as exhausted as we go to bed now we will  <br/>\nprobably never have sex again ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it will be hard at the beginning and that the child&#39;s needs  <br/>\nare on top.
