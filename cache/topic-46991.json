You might have a similar group near where you live.) They host various digs (abd ither dino-related activities for kids abd adults) in our area and elsewhere. We&#39;ve gone in a few day trips and had a great time. If you&#39;re ready for a bigger adventure, there are several places in western US (don&#39;t know where you are located) who run dino excavation trips for families.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a smaller scale, we&#39;ve purchased lots of small dinosaur excavation kits that have been great. My kids love them so much that I started to buy the kits by the case (seriously!) because they were about half the cost as in our local toy store. You can make similar kits by getting bones (replica dino bones or we tried it with chicken bones, too) and drop them into wet plaster and let it set. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you live near NYC, the natural history museum has a few simulated full-scale dig sites -- one at the special sauropod exhibit and a smaller one in the children&#39;s Discovery Room. The museum provides eye protection and chisels. (Do call ahead to make sure that these digs are still running.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat fun!!<br/>\n<br/>\nandrea<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86487535,"authorName":"Ren√©e Cooper","from":"=?iso-8859-1?B?UmVu6WUgQ29vcGVy?= &lt;rmilller@...&gt;","profile":"reneem29","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Dinosaur Digging Suggestions","postDate":"1310602403","msgId":47000,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTE0Ny13MTU3MTQ0Njc3MzM5MjY1OThCMUMxOUM4NDYwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PGl2a3Awcit1OXI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGl2a3Awcit1OXI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46994,"nextInTopic":47022,"prevInTime":46999,"nextInTime":47001,"topicId":46991,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"// My dd will be 4 in a couple of weeks and she really wants to dig up some dinosaur bones // Not quite the same as dirt digging, but one fun related activity","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-175885609\">// My dd will be 4 in a couple of weeks and she really wants to dig up some dinosaur bones //<br/>\n <br/>\nNot quite the same as dirt digging, but one fun related activity we have done is &quot;Ice Age Dinos&quot; -- I took a fairly large clear plastic box (has to be able to still fit in your freezer, but we have a 2nd one in the garage), filled it with a couple bags of ice from the grocery store, put some plastic easter eggs with toy dinos inside them into the ice, then filled the spaces with water.
