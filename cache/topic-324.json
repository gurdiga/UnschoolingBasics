We also did playgroup at the Waldorf school of OC.  Let&#39;s see, <br/>\nwe did it one year 2000-2001 up north at Highland Hall Waldorf school <br/>\nand then the following year 2001-2002 in OC.  That was with my older <br/>\nson.  We didn&#39;t go the year you went (although we went to all the <br/>\nfaires) and then I did it this past year with my youngest in OC.  I <br/>\nwill do it again with him next year.  He likes it and it is something <br/>\nfor us to do together. We are involved in a homeschool <br/>\nplaygroup/support group up (WestOCHS yahoo group) this way.  It&#39;s not <br/>\nspecifically an unschoolers group but there are a unschoolers in the <br/>\ngroup.  I also know there is a group called SOCHS (South OC HS) and <br/>\nthey have a Yahoo group too.  We are also involved with an attachment <br/>\nparenting group in OC...and there are many people who are or are <br/>\ninterested in homeschooling there too.  I would love to get together <br/>\nfor a playdate...or have you attend one of ours.  What is Pegasus?  <br/>\nIs Alex a boy?  Just checking...I know lots of girls who are Alex.  <br/>\nAnyway, would love to meet you.  <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kay alina&quot; <br/>\n&lt;angelsguard@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thanks for sharing Wendy.

I m Wendy,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1961013801\">I&#39;ve posted a few times but thought I&#39;d better do an intro...not that <br/>\nanyone is going to really remember with this HUGE list!  But here <br/>\ngoes...  I&#39;m Wendy, Mommy to Lucas (who turned 5 in March) and Ethan <br/>\n(who turned 2 in March).  We live in Huntington Beach, CA.  I was <br/>\nvery interested in Waldorf Education from the time my first was an <br/>\ninfant.  I always thought we would go that route...my children are <br/>\nthe ones who have lead me to the path of homeschooling and then <br/>\nunschooling.  After a year of preschool that Lucas just did not want <br/>\nto go to (he had fun sometimes but was mainly bored and did not want <br/>\nto be there), it became apparent to me that he just wanted to be at <br/>\nhome doing his own thing.  His &quot;own&quot; thing consisted of and an <br/>\namazing curiousity and imagination that is greatly hindered by the <br/>\nconstraints of a classroom setting...even one that, in my opinion, <br/>\nwas so beautifully different and nurturing as Waldorf.  He is <br/>\nconstantly searching for information and knowledge.  He taught <br/>\nhimself to read before he was 4.  He is a very divergent <br/>\nthinker...and that presented a lot of problems and issues for him in <br/>\nschool.  I had thought Waldorf was so great because it was so <br/>\ndifferent from mainstream education...but I realized that with all <br/>\nit&#39;s beauty and wonderful merits...it still puts children in a <br/>\nbox...and my child showed me how confining a box like school was for <br/>\nhim.  When we decided homeschooling was our path I just figured that <br/>\nI would use some sort of curriculum...but the more I read about <br/>\nunschooling, the more I realized that this is what my child has been <br/>\ndoing all along...and trying to get me to jump on the bandwagon.  And <br/>\nhe thrives on it.  His little brother, though very different in <br/>\ntemperament is falling right in line with what his brother does and <br/>\nit is a joy to see them blossom.  I still think that a lot of the <br/>\nthings about Waldorf and really nice and sweet...but I figure that I <br/>\ncan just sit back and knit a few gnomes and fairies and that will <br/>\nmake me happy.  Life can be very challenging with two very active <br/>\nboys...but we are having a blast.  I look forward to learning more <br/>\nabout unschooling and basically just striving to provide and <br/>\nenvirionment for growth and contentment in our family.  Thanks for <br/>\nlistening....<br/>\n<br/>\nWendy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27495,"nextTopicId":27345}}
