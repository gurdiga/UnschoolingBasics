Here my kids (11","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1776715157\">Thank you Karen!  That really is all I&#39;m trying to get.  It&#39;s radically<br/>\ndifferent from how life looks to me at least from a wide angle view.  Here<br/>\nmy kids (11 and 9) do help decide what&#39;s for dinner.  They pick out their<br/>\nown clothes (within reason) and they collaborated with us on the new<br/>\nfurniture we bought.  BUT we made the final decision.  What I&#39;ve been<br/>\nreading *looks like* kids get the final say no matter what and that is both<br/>\ndifferent and to my mind irresponsible.  And no, not just on this list.<br/>\nOther places too.  I&#39;ve been doing a pretty hefty amount of reading.  One<br/>\nsite mentioned her daughter (age 4) has been eating only ice cream for 6<br/>\nmonths because that&#39;s all she&#39;s wanted!  The writer was joyous about this.<br/>\nIt&#39;s these kinds of things that have me befuddled.  If this is what is meant<br/>\nby the philosophy well, I can&#39;t abdicate parenting.  That&#39;s negligence.  If<br/>\nit&#39;s more a matter of treating kids like they have a brain in their heads<br/>\nand can be a part of life then that&#39;s totally different and how I&#39;ve been<br/>\nraising mine all along.  HOWEVER, I still insist they move their bodies, try<br/>\nto eat well, and clean their rooms and bathroom.  They are a part of the<br/>\nfamily, not reigning over it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I thank you for your honest attempt at an explaination.  That was very<br/>\nkind of you. I hope you get to feeling better soon! =)<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/1/07, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kidgie@...\">Kidgie@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kidgie@...\">Kidgie@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 10/1/2007 7:17:13 P.M.

The other one, is based more in<br/>\n&gt; educational style i.e.; no curriculum, total freedom for the child to<br/>\n&gt; follow their<br/>\n&gt; interests, joy-driven learning. I&#39;m becoming more and more radical as time<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; passes, and it&#39;s freeing and soothing to me and to the kids. I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; how<br/>\n&gt; &quot;far&quot; I&#39;ll go (I guess you could say), but with each change, my children<br/>\n&gt; and I<br/>\n&gt; respond better to one another, it&#39;s more fulfilling than ever before and<br/>\n&gt; we are<br/>\n&gt; enjoying one another more. It&#39;s not at ALL the child-king situation that I<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; see you being concerned about. Or Lord of the Flies-esque. If so, we&#39;d all<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; loosing our minds and not be as happy as these families are and I am.<br/>\n&gt; Rather,<br/>\n&gt; this is a different type of hands-on parenting. It&#39;s just a matter of<br/>\n&gt; equality - we and our children are not the same. We are different, with<br/>\n&gt; different<br/>\n&gt; needs and wants and tastes. But we are still equal, and children can be an<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; equal part of the family - it&#39;s almost like...in proportion to the whole<br/>\n&gt; family,<br/>\n&gt; I see it kind of like this: A new baby plays a strong role in the family,<br/>\n&gt; but not on decision making things. Babies of course can&#39;t chose their<br/>\n&gt; clothes,<br/>\n&gt; the carpet we buy or the color of the car or whatever we are doing, but as<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; they age, they can and do. No reason NOT to allow that to happen! And as<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; age, they way they bring their ideas into the family, makes for more and<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; equality in more and more areas of the house...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ugh, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m explaining this well. I&#39;m trying to show the process<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; of how I see RU happening from birth on. When coming to it later on, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; choppy sometimes and can be a difficult transition. It may appear as you<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; describing it, but I can assure you, it isn&#39;t like that at all. I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; cow-towing<br/>\n&gt; to my children - and neither are they, to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I apologize if this made no sense.
