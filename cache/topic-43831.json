She was telling me that she &quot;wishes I didn&#39;t have to read so many books about parenting and that I could just go with my instincts instead.&quot; I was thinking about it a lot after she said it. When my daughter got old enough for &quot;discipline&quot; to be an issue, I tried to be &quot;the boss&quot; for a little while, but it just didn&#39;t feel right to me. I can specifically remember an incident when I was telling dd that she couldn&#39;t have something unless she first did something else. She wanted the &quot;reward&quot; before doing the thing I was asking her to do. I just remember feeling like a jerk that I was going to hold back this reward until she yielded to me. I had thought that the rewarding idea was better than using punishments, because I had heard people say it, but it felt so wrong to me. I started looking for books on different ideas about parenting. I found Alfie Kohn, and I was so relieved that there was<br/>\n research about punishments and rewards really being two sides of the same coin. More reading led me to unschooling, and I am in love.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am now trying to explain to my mother that I am NOW going with my instincts, but really BECAUSE I was able to find support of my instincts through my intellect, if that makes any sense. Occasionally I am tempted to try to &quot;get&quot; my daughter (now 3) to do something by rewarding her, but it&#39;s nice to have a clear philosophy and principles in my head so I can remind myself that I don&#39;t need to parent that way, even though it seems like it would be more convenient at times. Now that my goals in parenting are not to mold or train but to accept and trust my kids, I feel like I can trust myself and my own instincts better too (of course, I know am not perfect and that is ok too). I don&#39;t know if I could have gotten to this place without reading books and being on this and a few other lists. Or at least it would have taken me longer to get here.<br/>\n<br/>\nVickie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: plaidpanties666 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:plaidpanties666@...\">plaidpanties666@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sat, May 8, 2010 11:05:55 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] parenting instincts?<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nSomeone made a comment about trusting one&#39;s own instincts recently, an idea I find interesting just in terms of the wide range of experiences people have in that area. Some folks seem to fall right into unschooling - it feels natural or &quot;instinctive&quot; . I wasn&#39;t one of those parents, though, and can&#39;t necessarily speak to that experience. Being a big bad authority figure felt perfectly natural and instinctive to me, and I prided myself on the fact that, within the context of authoritative parenting, I could be nice about it. I had to actively learn to be a different kind of parent. So from that perspective, my instincts were part of what was in my way. I had to learn to listen to something beyond my animal nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, there&#39;s a catch in there, and I&#39;m not oblivious to it! I could just as easily say that being a big bad authority figure was something I learned - part of my baggage, and I had to un-learn it in order to get back to my kinder, gentler instincts. In the context of gentle parenting, that seems to be what most people mean by the word. Is that more true than saying its important to rise above my animal nature? I don&#39;t think its either more or less true, personally. I think human nature has really wonderful aspects to it, and also some hard-edged ugly aspects - and all of that is potentially useful and just as potentially problematic. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I like about the idea of principles, in the unschooling sense. My principles aren&#39;t the sorts of things I find instinctive, nor are they the sorts of things I can *just* intellectualize my way into being. I can&#39;t just feel my way there and I can&#39;t just think my way there, it takes some of both. When I find I&#39;m bogging myself down in over-intellectualiz ing a problem, it helps me to step back and feel my way through a little more - smell my kids&#39; hair or spend a day marvelling at their very existance. When I find I&#39;m bogging myself down with feelings, it helps me to step back and think things through.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for me, getting more comfortable with unschooling hasn&#39;t been about trusting my instincts so much as developing a better understanding of my whole process - all the things it takes for me to solve problems. It has been about learning how I learn and respond. I won&#39;t say I&#39;m done with that process, I still second-guess myself at the wrong times and fail to second-guess myself when I should be doing exactly that. I fumble around wondering what&#39;s the better option when my &quot;instincts&quot; are saying one thing and my &quot;baggage&quot; is saying another and my &quot;intellect&quot; has a third view of the matter. That confusion is sometimes part of my process ;) and there are times when its really important for me to communicate that to my kids - that I&#39;m confused. That I don&#39;t have a &quot;right answer&quot;. One of the wonders of unschooling is that its okay not to have a &quot;right answer&quot; all the time.

Because of my rearing around loud and obnoxious people, I tend to be loud and obnoxious too. My &quot;instinct&quot; is to yell or get loud when I get frustrated. That is my knee-jerk reaction. So, how do you differentiate between a knee-jerk reaction and real animal instinct? I don&#39;t know but it seems that there are times when they &quot;feel&quot; the same. My oldest daughter asked me the other day why I sometimes yell. I told her that it is because I get frustrated and feel like nobody is listening to me. I don&#39;t mean to yell because I don&#39;t like it and I don&#39;t think it is the best way to communicate. However, when I am stressed, I forget all that. Once upon a time, I probably would have blamed the kids for my yelling. Now, I recognize it for what it is. It is the result of years of baggage. The kids and I have an open dialogue about each of our weaknesses. I don&#39;t expect them to be perfect and they don&#39;t expect me to be perfect. Our open dialogue has helped each of us be more understanding with each other as well as all of the other people that we meet in our day-to-day interactions. When I was growing up, it was not acceptable to question the adults. It was not okay to bring up an adult&#39;s weakness. Adults were supposed to be the all powerful, all knowing ones. When I saw their weaknesses, it felt like a big huge lie because I had been trained to trust and listen to adults. There were so many mixed messages about the adult-child relationship that I am still trying to sort it all out. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"parenting instincts?","postDate":"1273331155","msgId":43885,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhzM3VraitwMXQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhydmllait0NHM3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43881,"nextInTopic":43889,"prevInTime":43884,"nextInTime":43886,"topicId":43831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Someone made a comment about trusting one s own instincts recently, an idea I find interesting just in terms of the wide range of experiences people have in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-979948897\">Someone made a comment about trusting one&#39;s own instincts recently, an idea I find interesting just in terms of the wide range of experiences people have in that area.

How parents do that spans from building a  <br/>\nwall of safety around their family to crossing fingers and hoping for  <br/>\nthe best. That whole spectrum of advice is easily found on  <br/>\nMothering.com and Parenting.com and any number of full service and  <br/>\nspecialized parenting advice websites.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat isn&#39;t on the mainstream spectrum is help for parents who want to  <br/>\nkeep children&#39;s free exploration as a top priority even when the  <br/>\nparent&#39;s fears make her want to put limits on it. How can a parent who  <br/>\nwants to give her kids the same freedom with TV she allows them in  <br/>\nbookstores and libraries when she fears the influence of consumerist  <br/>\nculture, the violence, and values that clash with her own? It&#39;s easy  <br/>\nto find parents who will help her build walls or armor to protect her  <br/>\nkids. It&#39;s easy to find parents who will shrug and say what can you  <br/>\ndo? It&#39;s not easy to find thoughtful analysis of what really happens  <br/>\nin families where kids are given the freedom to explore and help in  <br/>\ndoing that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  And I think not giving yourself some time alone is being unkind and  <br/>\n&gt; unfair to yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the advice here often gets misread as &quot;sacrifice yourself for  <br/>\nyour kids&quot;. But the message should be to find a way to incorporate  <br/>\nself care into the schedule without taking from the kids. The  <br/>\nconventional mindset is mom is the provider and she only has so much  <br/>\nto give and when that&#39;s gone that&#39;s it. (Or to give and give  <br/>\nselflessly until mom drops). While it&#39;s true time and energy are  <br/>\nlimited, if the mindset causes the kids to feel their (important to  <br/>\nthem) needs are getting shunted aside, the only option they have to  <br/>\nmeet them is to keep battle for them. If, on the other hand, kids  <br/>\ntrust from past behavior that &quot;We&#39;ll do it in 30 minutes&quot; or &quot;We&#39;ll  <br/>\nput it on tomorrow&#39;s schedule&quot; means that -- baring alien invasion --  <br/>\nit will happen, then kids are more understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one, adult or child, responds positively to &quot;You&#39;ve had more than I  <br/>\ncan give. It&#39;s my turn.&quot; They may feel guilty that they didn&#39;t realize  <br/>\nthey were taking too much. They may feel angry if they were trusting  <br/>\nsomeone to meet their needs. Or some other negative emotion that won&#39;t  <br/>\nhelp them feel good. But, if the running-low-on-energy person says  <br/>\ninstead &quot;Let&#39;s figure out how to meet both our needs,&quot; the energy and  <br/>\nemotional response is more positive and more conducive to working  <br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I really can&#39;t function well if I don&#39;t get a few hours once a week  <br/>\n&gt; to be alone. It&#39;s not much, and I start missing everybody, but it  <br/>\n&gt; also feels necessary and good, and gives them time alone with their  <br/>\n&gt; dad as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And most moms would agree. But if the kids feel they&#39;re being shoved  <br/>\naside, if mom&#39;s attitude is it&#39;s good for them despite their feelings,  <br/>\nit will tear at the relationship. While *you* may naturally find ways  <br/>\nto prevent that, for advice to be helpful to people here who seek ways  <br/>\nto build relationships that &quot;natural&quot; part may not be natural to them.  <br/>\n(If it were, they wouldn&#39;t be reading eagerly to figure it out!) How  <br/>\nto build relationships can&#39;t be just assumed as part of &quot;good&quot;  <br/>\nparenting because if it&#39;s not stated, those who have never experienced  <br/>\nanything other than authoritarian parenting don&#39;t know to put it in  <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We have bedtimes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most parents set some bedtime by the clock. It&#39;s pretty standard  <br/>\npractice. Some conventional parents are flexible and feel like great  <br/>\nparents when they let their kids stay up for something special. That  <br/>\nworks for certain personalities of kids, ones who are low key, ones  <br/>\nwho are compliant, ones who are able to set aside what they&#39;re doing  <br/>\nfor the morning. It works for certain personalities of parents, ones  <br/>\nwho can ease their kids into compliance. But for parents and kids with  <br/>\ndifferent personalities, it can feel like while they&#39;re doing what the  <br/>\nother parents are doing, their kids are fighting against the bedtime  <br/>\nso either the parent is failing or the kid is failing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore useful is advice that&#39;s independent of personality. Advice that&#39;s  <br/>\nbased on respect and trust, that&#39;s focused on helping kids meet their  <br/>\nneeds rather than getting kids to comply with the parents decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not &quot;wrong&quot; to have set bedtimes. Just as it&#39;s not &quot;wrong&quot; to eat  <br/>\nbeef. But for parents who are looking for more respectful solutions,  <br/>\nthe idea of setting bedtimes by the clock is as out of place for what  <br/>\nthey trust the list to provide as beef is on a vegan list. *Everyone*  <br/>\nknows how to set bedtimes ;-) And there&#39;s lots of support for it on  <br/>\nconventional parenting forums. But this list works to provide  <br/>\nalternative information based around deep respect for children that  <br/>\ncan&#39;t be found elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":416387420,"authorName":"lilyfoil","from":"&quot;lilyfoil&quot; &lt;seafaces@...&gt;","profile":"lilyfoil","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: deschooling and unschooling and acts of radical feminism (long)","postDate":"1273023163","msgId":43854,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhycWhycis1YXZoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhybDJzayt1ZWg0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43843,"nextInTopic":43855,"prevInTime":43853,"nextInTime":43855,"topicId":43831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There really aren&#39;t any &quot;have tos&quot; as far as unschooling is concerned. You don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; have unlimited or unregulated anything. But the other side of that is also true - you don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; regulate kids for them to be okay. That&#39;s what unschooling is really about, the freedom of stepping away from &quot;having to&quot; regulate kids &quot;for their own good&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, if you find you &quot;have to&quot; regulate something in order for you to be nice to your kids DO IT!!! Its better to be nice than some kind of picture-perfect unschooler. If you can&#39;t go through a day without fighting about food unless you make rules, make some rules. If you can&#39;t go through a day without screaming because you need ten minutes to yourself, for petes sake find a way to get those ten minutes! The point isn&#39;t to hate yourself and your life for a principle, its for you and your kids to LOVE YOUR LIFE. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut also consider that there may be other options, too, and one big Big option is shifting your perspective to see more of your child&#39;s perspective. That&#39;s what all the un-regulating is all about, really, seeing that children&#39;s perspectives are valuable, even when they&#39;re very very different from parents&#39;. Its Hard to value the perspectives of children. It takes a Lot of deschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As a feminist, I feel a little concerned when a mother&#39;s work seems to not be valued as such.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m about as radical a feminist as you&#39;ll find, and one of the gorgeous things about radical unschooling, from a radical feminist perspective, is that it holds all work of all people as valuable. The work of children, what engages them in the moment, is as valuable as the work of adults. The unpaid work of an adult in the home is as valuable as paid work. Being present and mindful, finding joys, and being kind are all as valuable work as anything overtly &quot;productive&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of women wanting time away from kids relvolves around sexist baggage - the rotten old messages that say that mothering is the least valuable work of all. Deschooling from sexist baggage involves making a conscious effort to actively value the life we&#39;ve chosen. Savoring our children for exactly who they are today is an act of radical feminism.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I think not giving yourself some time alone is being unkind and unfair to yourself.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>************<br/>\n<br/>\nFor kindness to work as a principle, it can&#39;t be something you &quot;apply&quot; - rather its something to live and living kindly doesn&#39;t mean ignoring your own needs. Sometimes it seems challenging to balance kindness with kindness. It can seem like there&#39;s a conflict between being kind to yourself and kind to your kids. If you&#39;re drowing in kindness-to-others, stop! Find another way. Drowing won&#39;t help you Or your children. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning to be proactive is kind - proactively finding ways to meet your own needs in small ways so that you have more energy overall is one of the kindest things you can do for yourself *and* the people you love. But learning to be more proactive can take a lot of deschooling. We&#39;re used to the idea of reactive parenting. Where do most parenting questions start? &quot;What do I do when x happens?&quot; The unschooling answer is often unsatisfying, initially, because it revolves around discovering why x happens and changing the situation so that x becomes a non-issue - and your perspective is sometimes the part of the situation most suited for change. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What do I do when my kids stay up later than I&#39;m happy with?&quot; is a regular question. From an unschooling perspective, finding more ways to be happy is really an important part of that question - because its impossible to make another person go to sleep if she or he isn&#39;t ready, but also because happiness itself is important.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We have bedtimes -- 8 pm for our daughters, 10 pm for myself, and usually the same for my husband.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of families have what could easily be called &quot;bedtimes&quot; - times when various family members go to bed. Mine is something like 9pm, Mo&#39;s around the same time, George and Ray&#39;s more like midnight. Its a regular routine we have, something that hasn&#39;t been created so much as figured out organically. &quot;Bedtime&quot; is particularly well suited to discovering organically because people have natural rhythms. The trouble is when one person&#39;s rhythm is inconvenient to another&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people do well with calming routines to settle down for the night, and those are always good strategies to try but that&#39;s also an idea that some parents find they need to deschool because not all children need to settle down to sleep, and even those that do won&#39;t always settle down by means of a mellow winding-down routine. Its something to experiment with, but The Biggest roadblock to finding a night-time rhythm that works for your family is having a pre-existing expectation as to what that&#39;s going to look like. Holding out an expectation that kids &quot;should&quot; be asleep by bedtime is one of the biggest causes of bedtime woes. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;We don&#39;t adhere strictly to these every night, but we stick to them as a general routine. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nExactly. General routines are helpful! Strict adherence, not so helpful. Do you resent your kids on nights when they&#39;re up an extra hour or two? I&#39;m guessing not - but why not? How did you get there? That&#39;s the really important part, the part that&#39;s being asked for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I myself have trouble eating properly<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I did for years - until I found a definition of &quot;properly&quot; that worked for my body. The same definition doesn&#39;t work for my partner&#39;s body. What&#39;s good for my body isn&#39;t what&#39;s good for Ray&#39;s 16yo body - and what&#39;s good for his body now that he&#39;s stopped growing and started filling out is very very different from what it was two years ago. What&#39;s good for Mo&#39;s 8yo body isn&#39;t what was good for Ray&#39;s body at 8. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;it seems it is about modeling balance<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Its not actually possible for me or my partner to model anything at all where food is concerned because our kids needs are so different from ours. Happily, it turns out that&#39;s one of the things we don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do! It really is possible for individual people, even children, to discover what&#39;s going to work for their individual bodies. Deschooling that is tricky, though, because so much emotional baggage gets tied up in food and eating. When eating gets tied up to emotional junk, then all foods are junk foods. Stress trashes digestion and elimination, trashes the body&#39;s natural defense systems, trashes human reasoning. So getting the junk out of food takes a whole lot of love and care. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor many adults, the process of learning self-love and self-care is tied up in developing a healthy relationship with food and eating. The trouble, its easy to mix up the specifics of What you&#39;re eating with that relationship. Modelling a healthy relationship with food isn&#39;t about the details of spinach over kale or quinoa over teff, its about living joyfully and kindly. Its about savoring. You can&#39;t make another person savor, though! What you can do is offer chances to savor, and notice what&#39;s appreciated. What&#39;s eaten automatically and what with gusto? Feed the gusto! Offer foods that provoke enthusiasm!  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeschooling food can lead to a period of worry that kids will never eat &quot;good food&quot; again, as kids&#39; choices can really narrow down for awhile to Just those things you wish they&#39;d eat sparingly. It can help to see the time as a re-learning the relationship between food and joy, re-learning gusto and enthusiasm where food is concerned. <br/>\n<br/>\nHumans are natural enthusiasts. We love to live and to learn. We&#39;re passionate and sparkly by nature. Radical unschooling is about believing that, and believing its enough. Revel in your passionate, sparkly nature, and that of your children! <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":416387420,"authorName":"lilyfoil","from":"&quot;lilyfoil&quot; &lt;seafaces@...&gt;","profile":"lilyfoil","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"finding one&#39;s own way or unschooling unschooling","postDate":"1272817104","msgId":43831,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhyazhrZyszM3FmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43838,"prevInTime":43830,"nextInTime":43832,"topicId":43831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi friends, I have been mostly lurking on this list for years now, and I am so thankful for it.
