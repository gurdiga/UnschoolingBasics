I also suspect many people on this list are in  <br/>\nthe same position, and are now trying to deal with their situation at  <br/>\nhand (a child/parent couple who are long past the age of having  <br/>\nlearned the EC signals).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, once I heard about EC, I couldn&#39;t use it directly but what I did  <br/>\ndo was use it as a way to re-think potty training in general.   <br/>\nWhenever I think about any topic about raising children (or even  <br/>\nraising adults - LOL!), I usually think &quot;what would a caveperson  <br/>\ndo?&quot;.  I think this, because I assume that was supposed to be our  <br/>\nnatural state - what we were meant to do as a species.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, when I heard about EC, I thought &quot;this makes perfect sense&quot; - a  <br/>\ncaveperson wouldn&#39;t have diapers, and they wouldn&#39;t want pee and poop  <br/>\nall over the cave, so probably there was a designated spot (or hole  <br/>\nin the ground) for pee and poop to go.  Thus, a caveperson would have  <br/>\nwatched their baby very carefully for the signals that something was  <br/>\nabout to come out, and then would have held their baby over the  <br/>\ndesignated spot (just what modern ECers do now).  I&#39;m sure it didn&#39;t  <br/>\ntake long for cavepeople figure this all out, especially since there  <br/>\nwas a long history of this behavior already in place in the culture  <br/>\n(I wish we still had this long history for breastfeeding, attachment  <br/>\nparenting, learning, etc!).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what does a modern-non-cavewoman-too late-for-EC woman do?  I  <br/>\ndecided that since I had put them into diapers &quot;un-naturally&quot; (as in,  <br/>\nagainst our original caveperson nature), I couldn&#39;t then force them  <br/>\nout of them.  This just helped me to relax and let potty training  <br/>\nhappen on its own.  I&#39;m lucky - both of my girls both decided to use  <br/>\nthe potty at a very young age (but there was pee and poop all over my  <br/>\nmodern cave while they were figuring this out!!), so it&#39;s very easy  <br/>\nfor me to have a &quot;happy ending&quot; to this story.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m not trying to say that it&#39;s easy for those struggling with  <br/>\nmuch older children using the potty.  I know it&#39;s a real challenge  <br/>\nfor those who have children who are older and not going on the potty,  <br/>\neven with a loving attitude toward it.  I only use the caveperson  <br/>\nstory in the sense that we can say, once again, that our modern  <br/>\nsociety has taken us away from our roots, our instincts, even in an  <br/>\narea like toileting.
