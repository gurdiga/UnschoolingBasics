The only organization at that time was The Seeing Eye in <br/>\nMorristown, NJ. They only placed dogs in the NE. I&#39;m a Southern girl!<br/>\n <br/>\nA few years ago I looked into it again, and there were 9-10 groups training guide dogs. (The generic name is guide dog.<br/>\nSeeing Eye is the oldest and most well-known so it&#39;s become as common as Xerox & Chlorox). Ryan is a *guide dog* from <br/>\nSouthEastern Guide Dogs, Inc (SEGDI) out of Palmetto , FL.<br/>\n <br/>\nGoogle guide dogs and puppy raisers in your state, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get the name of the organization nearest you.<br/>\nYou fill out a form and have in in-home interview. If you qualify, you get on a list for the next available puppy. SouthEastern uses <br/>\nlabradors, golden retrievers, goldadors (labXgoldens), Australian shepherds, German shepherds, smooth collies, <br/>\nviszlak, and a few Weimaraners. We&#39;re seeing fewer and fewer German shepherds because they can *seem* <br/>\nthreatening to some people. Hell, *some* people absolutely freak out when they see our viszla, Ryan, <br/>\nwalk into a store---they scream and run away! Most people get a lab, golden, or goldador as a first <br/>\ndog because they&#39;re quieter and more laidback. I specifically asked for a viszla and got one becasue <br/>\nof my history with dogs. He&#39;s a dream!<br/>\n <br/>\nHe leaves us the week after Thanksgiving. We&#39;re driving him down there. It&#39;s going to kill me.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been asked to raise another. But the puppy stage is so hard, and as soon as it&#39;s over, <br/>\nyou give him up! So, Ben and I are seriously considering getting two puppies and raising them <br/>\nto be search and rescue dogs. Not right away. We have an old German shepherd. I don&#39;t think she <br/>\ncan handle another puppy---much less, TWO!<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;ll wait until Basia dies and then get two pups. It&#39;ll take a couple of year to train them, <br/>\nso we have plenty of time. It&#39;ll be a nice thing to do at retirement. Also &quot;giving back&quot;---like <br/>\nthe guide dog, but we get to KEEP the dogs! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s been a WONDERFUL experience, and I LOVE being able to take him *everywhere*---groceries, <br/>\nmovies, restaurants, libraries, etc. It&#39;s FUN! We&#39;ve learned a lot about state laws and what <br/>\nthe blind can and cannot do, what the dogs are and aren&#39;t capable of.---the list is endless!<br/>\nI&#39;d be happy to talk with anyone---the pros and cons.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\nKelly LovejoyConference CoordinatorLive and Learn Unschooling ConferenceOctober 6-9, 2005<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":211042961,"authorName":"Salamander starr","from":"&quot;Salamander starr&quot; &lt;salamanderstarr@...&gt;","profile":"co_opamanda","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"7"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: bees & dogs WAS Not doing anything","postDate":"1126544752","msgId":6540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEwMy1GMjQzQUJBOUMzMDVBQzA3MDAzRkMxOUE3OUQwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDNzgzN0E1OTA2REU4MS0xNDBDLTcwMEFAbWJsay1kMzIuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6533,"nextInTopic":6544,"prevInTime":6539,"nextInTime":6541,"topicId":6495,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kelly, I was wondering how you got involved in raising guide dogs...you can email me direct if you like...salamanderstarr @ hotmail . com Thanks. ...

There are parasites and diseases you need to watch out for---imported critters and all that. If thet were native, they probably wouldn&#39;t be as fragile as they are. But they DO take some time and expperience. That comes in the form of local beekeepers---a dying breed; they&#39;re always looking for new, young beekeppers to mentor. I have two, Mike & Cliff.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m robbing them next week, I think. You shouldn&#39;t rob them the first year---they need that honey to help them make it through the first wintr. After that, you keep adding supers (or swarming!) and collecting the honey---either in the spring or fall.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou just need a quiet-ish spot in a corner of your yard. They fly directly out of the hive in a &quot;bee line&quot; so that should be clear---otherwise they bump into you! &lt;g&gt; I have them in my kitchen garden, on the side of the house, away from the rest of the yard. They still fly by the pool, but they NOT out to sting you. The only one who&#39;s ever been stung is me. They prefer standing water---a bird feeder or a small pond---we have both, and they&#39;re always lined up on the edges drinking! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThey are FASCINATING!! I have a chair in the kitchen garden, so I can watch them. Finding the queen when you go in is always a fun challenge---they all move so fast! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=- <br/>\n<br/>\nOr apply to foster animals with the local animal shelter.  We&#39;ve <br/>\nfostered 2 litters of kittens. And are waiting for the shelter to get <br/>\nback from LA with animals they rescue there.  I imagine we will be <br/>\nfostering a few animals from this.  Your local shelter may be <br/>\nbringing animals back too and probably really need foster homes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nGood on you. We&#39;ll stick with guide dogs for now! &lt;g&gt; Ben and I are considering raising two search and rescue dogs (that way we can keep them!). We haven&#39;t decided exactly which branch we want to work in---there are so many. Right now, they could use cadaver dogs in LA! But there are water dogs that find bodies under water. Dogs that find living people under rubble or in the woods or in snow/avalanches (we won&#39;t do that).<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m so amazed at what they are capable of! We&#39;ll wait until Ryan&#39;s gone before we get too far into it. It takes a few years to train them, so we figure we will wait a bit, then get two pups, train them, and hopefully start to work. That way, both boys will be pretty self-sufficient before we start working with the dogs seriously.<br/>\n <br/>\nTo get back on topic:<br/>\n <br/>\nLet your children see that life is truly full of opportunities. Let them see you DO things. And do things that fail, as well. Too often children see adults ONLY do what we&#39;re good at, while they struggle and struggle to be mediocre.

I was discussing with my 9yo <br/>\ndaughter about her mentioning wanting to go back to school, and I realized she <br/>\nhasn&#39;t deschooled yet.  I took her out of school in April, when she came to live <br/>\nwith me, and I told her I wouldn&#39;t send her to start a new school for just two <br/>\nmonths and I wanted her to settle in so I would homeschool her.  At first she <br/>\nused to ask what I wanted her to do, but I would answer, &quot;Whatever you want to <br/>\ndo.&quot;  I told her she could consider herself on vacation early if she wanted to.  <br/>\nA couple of weeks later she stopped asking what she should do.  Now that it is <br/>\nSeptember, she says she feels like she doesn&#39;t do anything.  I asked her what <br/>\nshe would like to do, and she said she wanted projects.  I went to Walmart and <br/>\nbought 15 one-subject notebooks for 10 cents each and some basic supplies - <br/>\npencils, a real pencil sharpener, pocket portfolios, etc.  I brought them home <br/>\nand she and her sister (they are 9 and 6) wrote down titles on all of the <br/>\nnotebooks (Forest Creatures, Cooking, Computers, Gaming, Dinosaurs, Safety, <br/>\netc.).  They came up with the titles and when they were done, they were very <br/>\nproud of themselves.  Then they started using the paper inside for both the <br/>\nsubjects they had written on the front and for scribble paper (Walmart was sold <br/>\nout of that when I went).  That seems to be as far as they want to carry it.  I <br/>\nam just afraid that she will come to me in a month or so again and say she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t feel like she is doing anything.  I remembered reading that it takes a <br/>\nmonth of deschooling for every year in school, so I thought that we would be <br/>\npast this.  But she is frequently coming to me and saying she is bored, but <br/>\ndeclining everything I suggest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the problem is that she is looking to me for guidance in &quot;what she <br/>\nshould be doing&quot;, and I want her to take charge of what she does.  How do others <br/>\nget past this?

When my kids were in school I was caught up in the getting them there- getting them home, sorting homework, uniform and meals treadmill.  We never had fun. All weekend was spent racing around  cleaning up, washing uniform and  P.E kit and sorting homework.  I hated it and cried every holiday with happiness they were home and cried evey time they went back til I found out they didn&#39;t have to go. I was so pleased they cam e uput I didnt do anything with them for weeks. Just having them in the house adn how great that was seemed enough til I got my head round the fact they needed me to talk with them and play and do fun stuff.  Now it has gone full circle. They get on with things on their own and don&#39;t need me like they did. The youngest, always unschooled,  two still do but not the older ones.<br/>\n  Ruth<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92643757,"authorName":"Leslie530@aol.com","from":"Leslie530@...","profile":"lescather","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Not doing anything","postDate":"1126122360","msgId":6513,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZkLjFiNmUxMjM5LjMwNTA5ZDc4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6512,"nextInTopic":6514,"prevInTime":6512,"nextInTime":6514,"topicId":6495,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/7/2005 11:46:41 A.M.

I don&#39;t think we  come by <br/>\nit naturally in our culture.  For me, it is definitely a LEARNED  behavior.  <br/>\nI stopped everything today and did something fun with my kids  because I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen glued to the news for a week.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think one of the reasons unschooling life is so much easier and the  family <br/>\nis so much more connected is the luxury of time.  You aren&#39;t  spending all of <br/>\nyour energy making your kids go to school and do homework, or do  school at <br/>\nhome work.  So now, you have the time and you will learn how to  BE with your <br/>\nchildren and it will be lovely.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"7"},"subject":"Not doing anything","postDate":"1126121912","msgId":6512,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRmbmZqbyt1NnRyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":6510,"nextInTopic":6513,"prevInTime":6511,"nextInTime":6513,"topicId":6495,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have been pretty distant from my kids, which comes as a horrific realization.

At first she used to ask what I wanted her to do, but I would answer, &quot;Whatever you want to do.&quot;  I told her she could consider herself on vacation early if she wanted to.  A couple of weeks later she stopped asking what she should do.  Now that it is September, she says she feels like she doesn&#39;t do anything.  I asked her what she would like to do, and she said she wanted projects.  I went to Walmart and bought 15 one-subject notebooks for 10 cents each and some basic supplies - pencils, a real pencil sharpener, pocket portfolios, etc.  I brought them home and she and her sister (they are 9 and 6) wrote down titles on all of the notebooks (Forest Creatures, Cooking, Computers, Gaming, Dinosaurs, Safety, etc.).  They came up with the titles and when they were done, they were very proud of themselves.  Then they started using the paper inside for both the subjects they had written on the front and for scribble paper (Walmart was sold out of that when I went).  That seems to be as far as they want to carry it.  I am just afraid that she will come to me in a month or so again and say she doesn&#39;t feel like she is doing anything.  I remembered reading that it takes a month of deschooling for every year in school, so I thought that we would be past this.  But she is frequently coming to me and saying she is bored, but declining everything I suggest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess the problem is that she is looking to me for guidance in &quot;what she should be doing&quot;, and I want her to take charge of what she does.  How do others get past this?
