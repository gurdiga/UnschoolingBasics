We went through the same things!  Got a new puppy and tried to do the training stuff but crates felt unnatural and as much as people said it would be better for them, I didn&#39;t get it.  I realized I found myself looking for ways to say yes whenever I could.  My dog likes to drink her water with her front paws in the bowl.  So we got a bigger more stable bowl because she&#39;d knock over the small one and lose all the water.  It was no big deal-the bowl didn&#39;t work for her and no she didn&#39;t do things like any other dog I&#39;d ever seen but so what?!  Who was she hurting by getting her paws wet when she drank?  NOBODY!  :)  And we were all less stressed and happy than if I had tried to teach her to drink without putting her paws in the bowl.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy friend loaned us a book called &quot;how to be a dog&#39;s best friend&quot; basically saying if you love your dogs you will discipline them and teach them complete obedience.  There are SO many correlations.  I just wish what we had done with the dogs just from instinct and being natural, I had done as naturally with my children.  I mean how many hours did we sit and fight over workbooks at the kitchen table?  When i should have just been looking for a bigger bowl and thinking &quot;no big deal.&quot;  :)  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, I think the universe is a nifty place because I was just thinking about all of this the other day though i hadn&#39;t verbalized it.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for sharing!<br/>\n <br/>\nJonni-Ann<br/>\nmom to two very cool kids and a couple of nifty dogs too<br/>\n<br/>\nAlison Broadbent &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abzb@...\">abzb@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well,  this must be my opening to ask about unschooling dogs!
