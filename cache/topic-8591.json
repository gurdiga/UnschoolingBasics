Raised beds worked best for me on many levels..easier to <br/>\nseparate different plants, easier to do the square foot thing (for me) <br/>\nand it kept weeding down. My soil wasn&#39;t so great (Florida) either, so <br/>\nI could get the beds really rich with raised style.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing about compost, tell your hubby if you do it right (and it&#39;s <br/>\neasy) it won&#39;t smell at all. You could start a worm bin, which might <br/>\nbe lotsa fun for your kids too...they can feed it food scraps and all.<br/>\n<br/>\nA healthy compost pile is virtually smell free, so it&#39;s fine for a <br/>\nsmall, city lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you google &quot; permaculture in the city&quot; you&#39;ll find some cool stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8578,"nextTopicId":8583}}
