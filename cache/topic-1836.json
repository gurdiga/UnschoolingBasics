We are all<br/>\ntrying to do our best with our children and i think<br/>\nwhen we share our experiences it is very helpful, but<br/>\ni will have to sign off this list also if it becomes a<br/>\njump on people and judge thing instead of a &quot;this is<br/>\nwhat works for me in my family&quot; .  We are all on a<br/>\njourney and it will take twists and turns and<br/>\nrethinking and rethinking again but i feel that it is<br/>\nbest done in an atmosphere of love and caring and<br/>\nattraction not promotion.  Every family is different<br/>\nand what works in one wont always work in another.  I<br/>\nknow email sometimes comes out harsher than it is<br/>\nmeant to and without the warmth that it is intended.  <br/>\n<br/>\ni have noticed a negative and judging feeling thing<br/>\nout there on this list and wonder if i am the only one<br/>\nfeeling this.  I am very confident in my lifestyle<br/>\nchoice and family philosophy but if i was new in<br/>\nestablishing this i would definately be afraid to ask<br/>\nthe questions if i thought i would be slammed<br/>\nverbally.  <br/>\n<br/>\nlove and peace<br/>\ndina <br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In a message dated 7/12/2004 11:16:09 AM Eastern<br/>\n&gt; Daylight Time,  <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dinafraize@...\">dinafraize@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i try to  instill in my children that they<br/>\n&gt; have only 2 &quot;rules&quot; in our family,  kindness and<br/>\n&gt; safety, this encompasses alot and they are<br/>\n&gt; encouraged<br/>\n&gt; to  think and decide for themselves if what they are<br/>\n&gt; doing/saying is kind and  safe.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Maybe thinking of them as principles rather than<br/>\n&gt; rules would be like taking  <br/>\n&gt; a giant step!<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

He just couldn&#39;t<br/>\nget his mind around the idea that we aren&#39;t<br/>\nresponsible for anyone else&#39;s happiness or<br/>\nunhappiness. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have the words to<br/>\ncommunicate what I meant back then so we tended to<br/>\njust go around and around. What I would say to him<br/>\nnow, if he ever asked �which he won&#39;t, but that&#39;s<br/>\nbeside the point ; ) :<br/>\n<br/>\nNoone is EVER resonsible for anyone else&#39;s happiness<br/>\nor unhappiness. We are each only responsible for our<br/>\nown emotions-- BUT that responsibility starts with<br/>\nbeing conscious of our every thought, word or action<br/>\nthat we let out into the world. We must weigh those<br/>\nvery carefully before letting them out. That is our<br/>\nultimate responsibility, to be true to life and true<br/>\nto love as much as possible. To own our mistakes<br/>\ngraciously, to not hold the past (even the immediate<br/>\npast...as in a dozen broken eggs or a smashed up car<br/>\nor hateful words) against one another. To try even<br/>\nharder next time. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not to say that we don&#39;t have our reactions in<br/>\nour family. Believe me, we do. We have them and then<br/>\nwe try to reign the emotions back in and own them as<br/>\nour own. We talk about it as calmly as we can. If we<br/>\ncan&#39;t talk about it calmly, we ask for a break and the<br/>\nchance to come back to it when we&#39;ve settled down. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is so important to let our children know<br/>\nthat we, as adults are fallible...so that they can<br/>\nhave permission to make their mistakes as well,<br/>\nwithout judgement or condemnation or punishment. But<br/>\nif we&#39;re already punishing ourselves, well...of course<br/>\nit&#39;ll be heaped on the kids, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been making an effort to point out to Tyler when<br/>\nI am being emotional about something that the emotion<br/>\nis mine, not his. That I may not like what his<br/>\nbehavior is...leaving empty popsicle wrappers all over<br/>\nthe house, eating like a neanderthal, talking back<br/>\nsarcastically when I ask him for help with<br/>\nsomething...but I love him and I want us to be able to<br/>\ncontinue to grow together, to learn to communicate in<br/>\nmore and more healthy ways. I also tell him that I&#39;m<br/>\ntrying to learn not to have the same old reactions.<br/>\nInevitalbly he lets me know that he&#39;s also trying to<br/>\nremember to change his behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nParenting is just such a hard job. Every single day<br/>\nsome major pattern I have carried forward from my own<br/>\nchildhood gets challenged and I have to work to<br/>\nsurrender my need to control and to be right. I try to<br/>\nremind myself that it&#39;s a hard job for Tyler to be my<br/>\nkid, because so often I have parented him using such<br/>\nold tapes...outdated information, habitual and<br/>\nreactive. Lila who is one will have a slightly easier<br/>\ntime of it because I&#39;ve learned so much of what not to<br/>\ndo.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, even the things that I thought I&#39;d gotten<br/>\npast will arise if I&#39;m overtired or not making time<br/>\nfor my own needs to be met.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Kimberly &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kontessa_Rose@...\">Kontessa_Rose@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Let me get this right, some here believe that no<br/>\n&gt; one is responible <br/>\n&gt; for how they effect other peoples feelings?

It is<br/>\n&gt; emotional bondage due to poor boundaries.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t care about other<br/>\n&gt; people&#39;s feelings (in fact,<br/>\n&gt; quite the opposite!

For example, lately my daughter has picked<br/>\n&gt; up from her cousin this<br/>\n&gt; sort of thing where they get mad at each other and<br/>\n&gt; they say &quot;Well, then I<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t come to you birthday party!  I won&#39;t be your<br/>\n&gt; friend anymore!&quot; and I am<br/>\n&gt; in there saying &quot;Those sound like the kinds of words<br/>\n&gt; that are meant to hurt<br/>\n&gt; people&#39;s feelings, not communicate how you are<br/>\n&gt; feeling or ideas about how to<br/>\n&gt; resolve this.

What I have seen being written is more <br/>\nalong the lines of you cannot &quot;make&quot; anyone feel anything.  The only <br/>\nperson who can feel that emotion is yourself.... nobody can physically <br/>\nMAKE you feel a certain way.  I could jump out of a closet and yell <br/>\n&quot;Boo!&quot; but whether you get scared or not is physically up to you and <br/>\nyou alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t be made to feel happy or sad or angry BY anyone.  Only you <br/>\ncan choose to have those feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not see anyone write anything along the lines of &quot;say and do <br/>\nwhatever the you feel like and to hell with being kind.&quot;  That&#39;s not <br/>\nwhat was being said.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [So you would be ok with your child makeing someone else feel badly <br/>\n&gt; and you would not expect<br/>\n&gt; or encourage them to make it better? ]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, my child cannot &quot;make&quot; someone else feel ..... anything.  If <br/>\nthey did hurt someone&#39;s feelings I would likely (and privately) point <br/>\nit out to them that their words can have an effect on people, but I <br/>\nwould not expect or encourage them to &quot;make it better&quot;.  That&#39;s <br/>\nimpossible.  You simply cannot make anything all better for anyone but <br/>\nyourself.  Saying &#39;sorry&#39; can sometimes help to make amends but ONLY if <br/>\nthe apology is heartfelt and never cajoled or demanded.<br/>\n<br/>\nModeling the behavior is the most effective way for your child to learn <br/>\nsocially acceptable ways of speaking and acting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [That would mean that each persons emotions are their own problems,<br/>\n&gt; including the childs? ]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would not suggest that emotions are &quot;problems&quot; actually.  They are <br/>\nwhat they are.  Feelings and emotions are part of every human... not <br/>\nproblems to be fixed, per se.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [... we feel that it is respectable to try and make those<br/>\n&gt; around us smile, specially when we do something to make them sad,<br/>\n&gt; even if we did not mean it. ]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is not realistic or healthy.  Respectability is highly debatable <br/>\nanyway.  Lots of &quot;respectable&quot; people do nasty things every day.  <br/>\nTrying to teach your child that THEY are responsible for another <br/>\nperson&#39;s happiness is soooo not cool.  We see the effects of that every <br/>\nweek on Oprah and Dr. Phil and through all the people in therapy.  It <br/>\nis just not physically possible to make other people happy.  If it were <br/>\nthen there would never be any disagreements or wars.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [ It does not shock me though, many here have said something to the<br/>\n&gt; effect of kicking out a single mother and her 4 year old son with no<br/>\n&gt; place to go regardless of the situation because it is negativly<br/>\n&gt; effecting my childs emotions. ]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not reason enough for you???  Your child&#39;s emotional and mental <br/>\nhealth is placed *below* your (chosen) obligation to this woman?  It&#39;s <br/>\nnot like anyone suggested that you tell her to leave just out of the <br/>\nblue, ya know.  Over and over you have written about all the mean <br/>\nthings she has done and said (screaming and yelling, guilt trips, <br/>\npouting, name calling, spanking her child, demanding rides, etc.).  WHY <br/>\nwould you continue to support her if it is driving you crazy and you <br/>\nfeel that she&#39;s wrong?  None of us here could know what this woman was <br/>\ndoing or not doing if you weren&#39;t hear telling us about it.  You were <br/>\nlooking for input and advice;  it was given;  you chose to ignore it.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s your prerogative, but don&#39;t come back acting like we&#39;re torch <br/>\ncarrying villagers demanding you to &quot;oust the ogre&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [I am sorry but no single person comes before everyone else in my<br/>\n&gt; world. ]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Really?!?  Wow.  It is hard for me to imagine that.  So....then to <br/>\nyou... your child doesn&#39;t rank higher than me?  Than a random guy in <br/>\nthe grocery store?  Than ANYBODY?  That&#39;s hard for me to wrap my mind <br/>\naround.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [Hubby is in the military, sometimes it seems like we do not<br/>\n&gt; even live in the same world so many others here do.

Her needs, her self esteem, and her spirit do <br/>\nnot have to be &quot;sacrificed&quot; in order for others to live how they chose <br/>\nto live.

If so, I&#39;d be happy to<br/>\nclarify what I am saying if you&#39;d find that helpful.  I think it is<br/>\nunhealthy for my children or me to be responsible for making each other feel<br/>\na certain way.  I see this situation with my sister and her 4 year old<br/>\ndaughter, for example, where my sister will say &quot;She (dd) won&#39;t LET me do<br/>\nsuch and such a thing!&quot;  My sister lets herself be held hostage by her<br/>\nchild&#39;s emotions.  That is not healthy communication in my opinion.  It is<br/>\nemotional bondage due to poor boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t care about other people&#39;s feelings (in fact,<br/>\nquite the opposite!  I am a very sensitive &quot;feeling&quot; type person) or that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t encourage and model to my children to care about the feelings of<br/>\nothers.  For example, lately my daughter has picked up from her cousin this<br/>\nsort of thing where they get mad at each other and they say &quot;Well, then I<br/>\nwon&#39;t come to you birthday party!  I won&#39;t be your friend anymore!&quot; and I am<br/>\nin there saying &quot;Those sound like the kinds of words that are meant to hurt<br/>\npeople&#39;s feelings, not communicate how you are feeling or ideas about how to<br/>\nresolve this.  I&#39;d like to hear words that talk about how you are feeling or<br/>\nideas on how to solve teh conflict.  Can you please use those?&quot;  And I model<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that distinction make any sense to you?<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not believe that each person&#39;s emotions are &quot;their own problems&quot;, but I<br/>\ndo think it&#39;s important that each of us in our family own our emotions as<br/>\nour own in order to communicate in a healthy, effective way about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":51071079,"authorName":"Kimberly","from":"&quot;Kimberly&quot; &lt;Kontessa_Rose@...&gt;","profile":"kontessa_rose","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Not responicble for others feelings?","postDate":"1089581976","msgId":1836,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjc2MybytuYjRtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1839,"prevInTime":1835,"nextInTime":1837,"topicId":1836,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Let me get this right, some here believe that no one is responible for how they effect other peoples feelings?
