People <br/>\nlike us who are NOT being &quot;schoooled&quot; have TIME and energy to go off <br/>\non interesting tangents.

Well, <br/>\nshe showed me the Karakorums of northern Pakistan in NAT. GEO. and <br/>\nthey ARE pointy and not weathered. And now she has spent weeks <br/>\nreading and thinking about the area and its culture. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s been in Japanese classes for 5 months now, from Anime. And her <br/>\nhuge Lego buildings from the last four years are mostly from video <br/>\ngames (one was a UCLA building we saw). And we&#39;re almost finished <br/>\nwith the real Dante&#39;s Inferno - (she read those &quot;cheater&quot; Cliff <br/>\nNotes at the bookstore). I read it to her while she plays WoW. We&#39;re <br/>\nrenting a cello (because some guy plays it on Blood+, an anime show) <br/>\nand she is listening to cello music all the time. And the Stand <br/>\nAlone Complex (more anime, very cerebral) has led her to psychology <br/>\ntextbooks and consciousness studies and a class at the local CC.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, who believes what she does? The family thinks we are wierd, <br/>\nexaggerating (if I mention anything), and say that I&#39;ll be sorry, <br/>\nbecause &quot;how can I do this to her?&quot; (I took her out of the public <br/>\nschool 4 years ago).<br/>\n<br/>\nShould be an interesting trip with me biting my tongue...<br/>\n<br/>\nPriscilla<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wrote this for my blog, but I&#39;m not sure I want to post it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>there - <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have a feeling it will sound snotty to my relatives invested in <br/>\n&gt; public schooling.
