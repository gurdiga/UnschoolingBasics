To me it is an extrinsic motivator and I don&#39;t get why <br/>\nthe kids need to do the badges. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it has to be a big deal.<br/>\nEarning badges might be a lot of fun for your children, your attitude <br/>\nwill make the difference between harmful rewards and just something <br/>\nthey enjoy.<br/>\nYOU know that a reward isn&#39;t a good way to motivate someone...so you <br/>\naren&#39;t going to use them to force your children to do an activity they <br/>\ndon&#39;t care for! That&#39;s the key in my mind.<br/>\nIf you used the badge to try and make them finish activities, THEN the <br/>\nreward could be harmful.<br/>\nIf you let your children pick and choose what they want to get out of <br/>\nspiral scouts, if you don&#39;t make an issue of the badges one way or the <br/>\nother, if you treat the badges as you would grades (something that <br/>\ndoes not define a person, nor has any weight in your family) but <br/>\nsomething fun they&#39;re choosing to do (just as they might choose school <br/>\none day) then I think it&#39;s all good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care for all the external motivators our society <br/>\nuses....colored belts in martial arts for example (NOT a tradition <br/>\nfrom Asia, but an American thing), but I don&#39;t think keeping our <br/>\nchildren away from all of it is a good idea either.<br/>\nYour children will know that the badges are just part of the <br/>\npackage...they can choose to earn them or NOT.<br/>\nLet them get what they want from this experience and I think you could <br/>\nall have a lot of fun with it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6423,"nextTopicId":6432}}
