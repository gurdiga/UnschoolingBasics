Yes, most kids just veg out.   They need <br/>\ntime to decompress, they need time to start trusting themselves....and  You!  <br/>\nYou were the one that sent him to school!  LOL!  Many  people here say they pick <br/>\nup their own projects, you have just shown your child  the biggest <br/>\nunschooling lesson.  I want to learn something so I&#39;m going to  just do it.<br/>\n <br/>\nYour assignments are to let your child have fun and let the day lead  it <br/>\nwhere it will, and you read, read, read about unschooling.  Enjoy your  child.  <br/>\n <br/>\nCheck back in with other questions.  It is hard to change your whole  idea <br/>\nabout school!<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":218449772,"authorName":"zenmomma@comcast.net","from":"zenmomma@...","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] PS to unschool..what do you tell him?","postDate":"1129324823","msgId":7026,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwMTQyMDA1MjEyMC44MjY0LjQzNTAyMTE3MDAwNjJCOTIwMDAwMjA0ODIyMDkyMjQ2MjcwRTAzMDMwMTAzMDIwQTk2QGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":7025,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":7025,"nextInTime":7027,"topicId":7017,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... the school tommorrow.

When you first take a child out of school it takes awhile for everyone to get used to this new way of living. There&#39;s more time together, less scheduling, altered sleep and wake times. I&#39;d let him know that you just want him to decompress for awhile. Get the school stuff far enough away to begin your new homeschooling journey fresh. Tell him it&#39;s going to look different than school and that&#39;s the whole point. Then tell him you&#39;re so happy he&#39;s home. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve decided that you will learn better out of the school<br/>\n </span></blockquote>environment esp. since you have not wanted to go&quot; &quot;You can learn in all<br/>\ndifferent ways such as when your cooking (he likes to cook), taking a<br/>\nwalk outside, going to a park or museum, etc&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t bother with all of that. I&#39;d just tell him I think he needs a break. Tell him you&#39;re going to learn more about unschooling while he recuperates and then give him some breathing room. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d let him explore whatever it is that he wants to explore. If that&#39;s TV and video games, then so be it. I&#39;d watch with him if he&#39;d like it and support his interests. I&#39;d offer alternatives and then be prepared to be turned down for awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe deschooling process really is necessary or else you tend to still stay on the school treadmill, just in a different location.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water.
