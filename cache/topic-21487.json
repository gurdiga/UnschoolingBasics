LOL  I<br/>\nmiss my brain sooooo much!  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as your question goes - we have always included the youngers in<br/>\nthe conversations around here.  Obviously they&#39;ll interject with<br/>\nthings that sound like they&#39;re coming from a 3yr old (or whatever) but<br/>\nI think it&#39;s important that they listen and feel welcome into the<br/>\nconversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as reading stories goes...I typically read different stories<br/>\nbased on their &#39;level&#39; during the day but DH reads a book to the<br/>\noldest 6.5DS just before bed.  4DD (her bday was today) has been going<br/>\nin to listen to the his stories for months.  They&#39;ve read all through<br/>\nthe Narnia series a couple times, Charlotte&#39;s Web...some smaller books<br/>\nhere and there and now they&#39;re doing Lord Of The Rings.  She takes a<br/>\ncouple of quiet toys and listens to the story while she plays.  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure that it matters if she catches the story and conversation -<br/>\nshe&#39;s hearing the rhythm of speech, increasing vocabulary and just<br/>\nplain being included, which is probably more important at 3-4yrs than<br/>\ncomprehension of the story at hand.  She does know that she needs to<br/>\nbe quiet or she&#39;s not welcome to stay.  She can pick a different story<br/>\nfor herself but she rarely, if ever, does.  She can tell me more about<br/>\nthe storyline than I thought she would be able to...and surprises me<br/>\nwith &quot;what does xxxxx mean?&quot; the next day.  (Of course, to prove me<br/>\nwrong as children often do, she just came downstairs in the middle of<br/>\nthe story with a sad face, &quot;Daddy&#39;s reading the end of the chapter and<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to listen to it because I thought there were gonna be bad<br/>\nguys to fight but there aren&#39;t any.&quot;  lol)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest will be 2 next month and she is still on her own story<br/>\nschedule but I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be long before she&#39;s welcomed into the<br/>\nfamily story time with the big kids before bedtime.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, those are my .02...from one brain-dead preggo to another.
