They have them at both the Middle <br/>\nSchool and High School levels -- teams (which might represent several <br/>\ncountries) are usually formed at schools, but we have a homeschooling <br/>\ngroup preparing for and participating in them. This year we&#39;re doing 2 <br/>\ndifferent MUN&#39;s in a year. I think it basically took one homeschooling <br/>\nmom&#39;s total diligence and devotion to make it happen here. She first <br/>\ntaught an Introduction to the UN course, and followed with a course to <br/>\nprepare kids for the actual MUN. Now she repeats the process every year <br/>\nand we&#39;re all eternally grateful to her! She also dovetailed in a trip <br/>\nto NYC to the United Nations, including 2 days of meetings with <br/>\nofficials and NGO&#39;s (Non-governmental organizations recognized by the <br/>\nUN).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get more specifically interested, I can pass along your e-mail <br/>\nto her so you can connect for info/advise...<br/>\n<br/>\nGo here to start researching:  www.unausa.org/<br/>\n<br/>\nJulia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4821,"nextTopicId":4836}}
