That last post was SO on the money!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I know what a lack of sleep can do to a person---that&#39;s why it&#39;s <br/>\nused as torture!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I have a 13 yo who wants to stay up later<br/>\nand later..now it&#39;s up to 3:00 am. I also have a 7yo who doesn&#39;t sleep <br/>\nmuch<br/>\nlater than 7:00 am, and a very active child whose schedule is right in <br/>\nthe<br/>\nmiddle of these. I am a part-time ER doc ( 6 shifts per month, each 24 <br/>\nhours). I<br/>\nam a single  parent (no other income), and I&#39;m nearly 47, so maybe my <br/>\nsleep need<br/>\nis creeping up some. Here is the problem: My 13yo ds goes to bed 4 to 6 <br/>\nhours<br/>\nbefore my 7yo ds gets up. I have no adult private time to think, read, <br/>\npay<br/>\nbills, etc. When any of the kids has a chance to be with me (private <br/>\nmom time<br/>\nthey call it) they want it and I am glad!  But I am starting to wear <br/>\nout.<br/>\nShould I wait this out? Try to tell the 13yo that if he wants to stay <br/>\nup that<br/>\nlate he&#39;ll have to sometimes understand that I can&#39;t sit with him, <br/>\nsometimes<br/>\nI&#39;ll have to do something else. He does try to keep me awake but seems <br/>\nto mostly<br/>\nhave trouble with not sitting beside me if I am<br/>\n  already awake.  The problem isn&#39;t that I don&#39;t want to be with <br/>\nthem...just that<br/>\nI am wearing out. I have been sorely tempted to be sure the 13yo goes <br/>\nto bed at<br/>\nmidnight or 1:00 am instead.  Also, if he does any video games or TV <br/>\nthat late<br/>\nat night, no matter the topic, he can&#39;t sleep for hours...he actually <br/>\nisn&#39;t<br/>\nhappy with that. And during the day we just don&#39;t see him until <br/>\nafternoon.  I<br/>\nthink he is trying to get some psychological space, too...again, how do <br/>\nI meet<br/>\nhis needs AND mine? I can&#39;t spend my days as a sleepy zombie!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThey should all be told how tired you are! I bet they would be willing <br/>\nto help work towards a solution. Kids can be very creative! They want a <br/>\nhappy, healthy family too.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have a friend who could take them both one day a week so that <br/>\nyou could catch up on sleep or get things done?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as his (13 yo) having a hard time sleeping after playing, I&#39;d <br/>\nsuggest the same things we say to parents of toddlers: he could make <br/>\nhis room &quot;sleep ready&quot;---dim the lights, spray lavendar around, drink a <br/>\nwarm drink, maybe take a warm bath, listen to quiet music or watch a <br/>\nboring movie (golf or bowling with the sound down does it for me! &lt;g&gt;). <br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to shut our brains down with bright lights---and TV, the <br/>\ncomputer screen, and video games can make it seem like daytime 24/7.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.
