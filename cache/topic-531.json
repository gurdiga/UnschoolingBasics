At <br/>\nthat point, the adult hears what the issue is and sees that I treat <br/>\nit as legitimate. How they respond varies. Sometimes I understand <br/>\nwhere they are coming from; e.g., Mikey starts screaming when someone <br/>\nelse tries to strap him into his carseat. Well, of course he needs to <br/>\nbe strapped in, so sometimes the adult doesn&#39;t see the real reason <br/>\nhe&#39;s fussing.

As well meaning as the neighbor may have been that was stepping over the line.   It was not his business .   Sensitive to touch or not, NO one likes to be grabbed or reprimanded.   No one.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe martial arts instructor should know more creative ways to get a kid to join /or not than grabbing and pulling.  That is his job.  Five is very young.  Even if he was not in the circle he can hear what is being said and choose to join when ready.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, Keegan will need to learn not to use biting and spitting as a defense.  He is still too young to know what else to do, but needs to learn.  I<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I say this about spitting is because in &quot; this day and age of AIDS&quot; , people will use this against him.  It is ridicules for a natural kid reaction of spitting to be considered an assault but it is now.

He, in addition, is also sensitive to <br/>\ntouch meaning he doesn&#39;t like to be touched.  He can take a little <br/>\ntouching by me, but not by outsiders.  The other day we were talking <br/>\nto our neighbors and Keegan was in the back of the truck with the <br/>\nrear window open.  Now, there is a windshield wiper which he had <br/>\naccess to and was playing with.  It didn&#39;t bother me, but my neighbor <br/>\nfelt the need to tell him that he shouldn&#39;t that because it might <br/>\nbreak.  When he started to speak to Keegan, Keegan ducked away and <br/>\nwhen he did this the neighbor held him by the arm and didn&#39;t let go.  <br/>\nBefore I could say anything Keegan stood up and blew the biggest <br/>\nraspberry right in his face.  The neighbor was so offended, and <br/>\nprobably more so when I didn&#39;t make Keegan apologize or even make a <br/>\nbig deal out of it. I felt and still feel that Keegan had the right <br/>\nto defend himself, I mean think about Keegans point of view.  Here&#39;s <br/>\nthis guy who grabs him and demands for him to listen and the feeling <br/>\nof his hand around his wrist probably felt like daggers.  He aslo had <br/>\na similar reaction to his martial arts teacher.  He spit and even <br/>\natempted to bite him because he grabbed and started dragging Keegan <br/>\nto the middle of the floor when Keegan didn&#39;t want to participate in <br/>\na huddle.  Can you imagine a sensitive to touch kid participating in <br/>\na huddle?  <br/>\n    Am I doing the right thing?  Later when all was calm I asked him <br/>\nhow he felt about both situations and he expressed that he didn&#39;t <br/>\nlike to be touched like that.  We just talked about how next time he <br/>\ncould try to tell them first that he doesn&#39;t like to be touched or he <br/>\ncould give me a look that would tell me he wants my help with it, but <br/>\nI didn&#39;t tell him not to spit in people&#39;s faces.<br/>\n   Just curiose about opinions you might have on the subject.  Maybe <br/>\nI should have been more active and said take your hands off him, but <br/>\nit all happened so quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnMarie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":585,"nextTopicId":603}}
