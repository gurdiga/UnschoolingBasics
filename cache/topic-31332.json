In that case do you think that is pushing? <br/>\nMy dd does this ALL the time (well words that is, now). She seems to have figured out letters and will put them into words and have me tell her what they are. Sometimes this is a fun feat for my husband and I.<br/>\nI hadn&#39;t really thought about it much, but it seems we are in the beginning of reading or maybe the middle? I am not exactly sure, lol. I guess it really &quot;starts&quot; at birth.<br/>\nOur story with reading so far (she is 4 almost 5) is that she has always loved books. We read everyday for hours. Sometimes she reads alone for hours depending on what she wants to do. She has most of our short books memorized. In my opinion that is the beginning of reading. She points out words she knows all of the time. She learned to write her full name a couple of years ago just because she wanted too. LOL. She likes to write little stories and notes to us a lot. If she doesn&#39;t know how to spell something, she asks. Sometimes she wants me to write it down for her to copy, sometimes she wants me to tell her the letters and she can write them alone. I always ask what she wants. <br/>\nSo I don&#39;t know where exactly that puts us on learning to read (and I don&#39;t really care either I guess) it is just something she really loves so we go for it. No different than the interest in fish, dinosaurs, Polly pockets, Barbie&#39;s, and webkinz. <br/>\nBTW Webkinz was mentioned before, it is an amazing reading &quot;tool&quot;. My did can tell you what anything says on there (other than the quizzes). <br/>\nSo I don&#39;t really have any experience with older children and reading, but my advice is when they are ready it will happen. Kind of like potty training:)!! LOL.<br/>\nBack to the original reason I responded, what do you guys think &quot;is&quot; pushing? Answering your children&#39;s questions is just natural and the basis of unschooling to my knowledge. I am assuming that you are talking about the parent &quot;quizzing&quot; the child, but I just want to clarify so I can rethink my position if not:)!!!<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nJess:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: when did your kid(s) learn to read?","postDate":"1206799693","msgId":31388,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdCNTlFRTgzLUEyRUYtNEZCNC1CMjc1LTFDOEQ1QUYxQjVDQUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZzbGhudis2ZjN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZzbGhudis2ZjN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31387,"nextInTopic":31389,"prevInTime":31387,"nextInTime":31389,"topicId":31332,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Throw away school benchmarks. Look at your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs was pointed out, recognizing individual letter sounds was useless  <br/>\nto some children. Also, as was pointed out, lots of kids pick up  <br/>\nreading by absorbing whole words. A parent going through that  <br/>\nchecklist will be looking outside their child for what the child  <br/>\n&quot;should&quot; do rather than looking at the child and what they can do and  <br/>\nwant to do. To help your child figure out the world in their own  <br/>\nunique way, know your child, not some checklist (that quite possibly  <br/>\nhas nothing to do with your child.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn an assembly line, it&#39;s important to check off the processes the  <br/>\nteacher needs to run her product through in order to demonstrate to  <br/>\nthe authorities that learning is taking place.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt home, neither the order is important nor the checklist itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the biggest barrier to unschooling of this suggestion is  <br/>\ncreating the image in parents&#39; minds that a child&#39;s reading could be  <br/>\nblocked for months and months with reading because they haven&#39;t  <br/>\npicked up &quot;short vowel sounds&quot; or &quot;consonant sounds&quot;. While certainly  <br/>\nimaginable, does it happen with real unschooled children?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really pretty much impossible for a child to be stuck in that  <br/>\nstate in a natural environment. The information is there. When  <br/>\nthey&#39;re ready to absorb it, it may take a couple of days for the  <br/>\n&quot;Aha!&quot; to hit, but hit it will. (Unschoolers  can infer the truth of  <br/>\nthat from the fact that their teens read just fine :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother barrier is creating the image of children being stuck because  <br/>\none piece of information is missing. Again, imaginable. Again, does  <br/>\nit happen? It&#39;s way too much worry to place on a parent that their  <br/>\nchild&#39;s learning is being blocked by a piece of information. It won&#39;t  <br/>\nhelp the parent relax into understanding that children are born to  <br/>\nlearn. It won&#39;t help parents create a peaceful environment. It will  <br/>\nfill it full of worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child has a problem recognizing individual letter sounds -- and  <br/>\nno unschooling parent should be testing to see if this is true! -- or  <br/>\nany sticking point people naturally go through, much better to play  <br/>\ngames, read poetry, read books, write lists. (Assuming the child  <br/>\nwants to!) Create a rich environment so that the information is there  <br/>\nfor the child to puzzle out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone sees an opportunity to hold out their finger to a child  <br/>\nwho would like that finger, absolutely do so! If a child is holding  <br/>\nthe hammer by the heavy end, they&#39;d probably appreciate showing them  <br/>\nwhich way is more useful. (But step back if they turn it back around  <br/>\nagain!)

And there&#39;s a  <br/>\ngrain of truth in &quot;they will just read because they are surrounded by  <br/>\nprint.&quot; I&#39;d say that was true for my daughter. But &quot;surrounded by  <br/>\nprint&quot; almost sounds like you&#39;re thinking that plunking them in a  <br/>\nlibrary and hoping they&#39;ll read what&#39;s in it, eventually, is what  <br/>\nwe&#39;re talking about. It isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I wrote about our experience, but hadn&#39;t sent yet:<br/>\n<br/>\n***********<br/>\n<br/>\nDd showed signs of &quot;reading readiness&quot; around 7 or 8.  Other than my  <br/>\ndh freaking out for a short while and trying to get her to sound out  <br/>\nwords (which she rightly refused to do) instead of just providing the  <br/>\nword she was asking about, we just kept reading to her. She liked us  <br/>\nto read stories (fiction/history), but preferred to look at non- <br/>\nfiction books herself (mostly about animals). I&#39;m sure she was reading  <br/>\nat least some of what was in those books then, but she didn&#39;t want to  <br/>\ndeclare herself a reader until she, herself, felt competent.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer reading began to take off when she started playing Zoo Tycoon and  <br/>\nsimilar computer games. To &quot;get to the next level,&quot; she had to figure  <br/>\nwords out. I was available if she wanted to know a certain word, but  <br/>\neventually, she worked it out herself. It was kind of seamless; in  <br/>\nother words, there was no specific date that she was officially  <br/>\n&quot;reading.&quot; But I&#39;d say she was reading with fluency and comprehension  <br/>\nbetween the ages of 10 and 11.<br/>\n<br/>\nComputer games, Nintendo DS games, Neopets, Webkinz, MMORPGs, strategy  <br/>\nguides, books, magazines, TV, Pokemon and other cards, manga, Betty  <br/>\nand Veronica comics, Calvin & Hobbes books, ZooBooks, Which Way USA  <br/>\nmaps are just some of the &quot;tools&quot; she used to learn to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe *has* always been surrounded by print in our house.  We are  <br/>\nreaders ourselves, we own a lot of books and magazines, we use our  <br/>\ncomputers.  My dh is a race car driver, but has written 7 books on the  <br/>\nsubject. I&#39;m a former sports magazine reporter and currently working  <br/>\non an editing certificate. Words (and reading) mean something to us,  <br/>\nfor sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we just &quot;bathed her in words&quot; from birth. But she learned to read  <br/>\nwhen *she* was ready. Mostly, she learned because she wanted to, in  <br/>\norder to do what she wanted to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n*************<br/>\nIf your child really wants to do a workbook, go for it. Don&#39;t have a  <br/>\nlot of expectations around it, though (like &quot;finishing&quot; it). It might  <br/>\njust be fun practice for a short period of time for the child. Let it  <br/>\nbe a step amongst many.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Asking what an &quot;f&quot; looks like or &quot;how do you write horse&quot; both seem  <br/>\ndesigned to test a child&#39;s knowledge or skill. I recommend against  <br/>\nthat (see above &quot;sounding out&quot; fiasco, which in my dd&#39;s case, stopped  <br/>\nher from wanting anything to do with reading for a while).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou *can* point things out as a matter of course - while you are  <br/>\nreading to your child, for instance.

NOT for you to *worry about*, but just as<br/>\ninformation you can use to help him. You said &quot;he struggles with reading and<br/>\nwriting&quot;. So is he getting stuck due to a lack of fluency? The fact that<br/>\nit&#39;s writing as well as reading makes me think it&#39;s not a comprehension<br/>\nissue but more of a &quot;putting sounds together/taking them apart&quot; issue. You<br/>\nmentioned he shines at WoW, so I assume he&#39;s intelligent in the sense that<br/>\nhe can think logically and understand complex patterns, etc. What is his<br/>\noral language like? I mean, does he tend to speak in short sentences, does<br/>\nhe have a rich vocabulary, does he have a sense of flow when he talks about<br/>\nevents that have happened, etc, etc. At this point I would focus on his<br/>\nwriting since at his age he probably has things to say (well, every age does<br/>\nof course, but I haven&#39;t yet met a teenager without strong opinions! :)<br/>\nAlso, through improving his writing, his reading will improve. So, what is<br/>\nit about his writing that demoralizes him so as not to want to keep trying?<br/>\nFor kids that struggle with handwriting an obvious way to circumvent that<br/>\nwould be to encourage him to type on the computer, with the explicit goal of<br/>\nimproving his writing (IF that is his goal...you mentioned being<br/>\nconcerned...is he???

Worry tends to block<br/>\nwhat we can do to help!) It&#39;s first knowing that the horse is thirsty so to<br/>\nspeak :) and then clearing the path between the horse and the river, which<br/>\nmeans standing right next to the horse and looking at the ground he&#39;ll be<br/>\nstepping on, one step at a time, to see what kind of rocks, holes in the<br/>\nground, and quicksand is in the way...OK, NOW I&#39;ve taken that analogy too<br/>\nfar! :) Hope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Mar 27, 2008 at 9:13 PM, Shileen Nixon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shileennixon@...\">shileennixon@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Mar 27, 2008, at 3:53 PM, Barbara Perez wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in my opinion, helping children learn to read (as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; helping them with lots of other things, including math) has a lot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to do with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; meeting them where they&#39;re at and holding their hand as they climb<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; next step, so to speak.

But not about whether a child that&#39;s developmentally<br/>\nready will read.  I&#39;m disagreeing  with the implication that there&#39;s no use<br/>\nin figuring out *where* in that development continuum a child is, that they<br/>\nmay not benefit from &quot;hand-holding&quot; (ad opposed to &quot;pushing&quot;) them through<br/>\nthe next developmental step. An analogy would be an infant taking their<br/>\nfirst steps, &quot;cruising&quot; by supporting themselves to furniture. This is a<br/>\ncommon developmental step between not walking, and walking on their own. The<br/>\nrole of providing the furniture (and perhaps getting the sharp corner of<br/>\nthat glass coffee table out of the way, to stretch the analogy) is what I<br/>\nbelieve the adults should be for the emerging reader. You can call it<br/>\nteaching if you want, I see it more as facilitating, supporting. Yes,<br/>\nwithout it, the child will probably eventually still get up and start<br/>\nwalking on their own. But if the parents see that there&#39;s a way to make it a<br/>\nlittle bit easier and less frustrating for the child that&#39;s stuck and WANTS<br/>\nto get up, what&#39;s the harm in helping them by showing them how? Did you ever<br/>\nbend over to let an infant grasp your fingers for balance while taking a few<br/>\nsteps? If you did, you know the joy of that shared experience. I believe<br/>\nit&#39;s the same  with reading: It won&#39;t do any good to try and help at a<br/>\ncertain step the child is not ready for (which is, by the way, why schools<br/>\ndon&#39;t work!)

So, to be able to help you I guess my first questions<br/>\nto you would be about the specifics of where your daughters are in the<br/>\ncontinuum of reading development. Do they know their alphabet? Recognize<br/>\nindividual letter sounds? Consonant sounds only? Short vowel sounds? Do they<br/>\nknow that a single vowel can stand for different sounds depending on what&#39;s<br/>\nnext to it (among other things)? Do they enjoy being read to? Can they<br/>\nfollow along word by word when they&#39;re read to? And so on and on! I could<br/>\nask a lot more specific questions such as this, but my point is, the more<br/>\nyou tell about where each of them are, the easier it would be to see what<br/>\nthe next step is, and in my opinion, helping children learn to read (as<br/>\nhelping them with lots of other things, including math) has a lot to do with<br/>\nmeeting them where they&#39;re at and holding their hand as they climb to the<br/>\nnext step, so to speak. Does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Mar 27, 2008 at 12:17 PM, DJ250 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dj250@...\">dj250@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m being pretty patient by my standards but I&#39;m just itchin&#39; for my<br/>\n&gt; girls to read, esp. my 9 y.o..
