Hubby and I kind of officially hooked up at the medieval fair too!!  We had gone on a couple of dates before hand, maybe two or three (duh, that&#39;s a couple, sorry), but the weekend we went to the fair we decided to make it official.  It&#39;s funny, we became official on April 4 (4-4) and then got married almost 4 years later on August 8 (8-8).  I always said 4 was my lucky number.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always wanted to get involved with the SCA, but we never did.  I have thought about joining as a family now that the kids are big enough to get into it.  They both love sword fighting and the time period (they also love Star Wars, and in a weird way, they kind of interconnect).  I had a very good friend in school that was a major member for many years, although I don&#39;t know if he still is part of it or not.  We would usually find him there when we went.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat day do you usually go?  We have usually gone on a Saturday, but last year it was SOO crowded that I&#39;m thinking about having hubby take some leave so we can head up early and go on Friday.  At the very least we can leave the dog at my parents house and not have to worry about her at the park.<br/>\n<br/>\nHubby really wants to get on at Tinker (he lived there as a kid when his dad was in the AF and he has always wanted to go back).  I think he feels more comfortable with the military element since he was a military brat and now has spent most of his adult life in the military too.  But he&#39;s open to anything, and although we are thinking Choctaw, we are open to living anywhere in the area.  I figure when he finds his job we can go from there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat would be cool to meet at the fair though!!  And your son&#39;s shield sounds cool!!  I think if we got into it my son would want to build his own armor and weapons too.  I won&#39;t allow guns in my house, but swords are okay, and I can&#39;t quite figure out how I make that justification cause they technically both are weapons, but some how I make them different.  My husband is about to start Tai Chi and when he heard they have swords, he was so excited.  <br/>\n<br/>\n°Ü°  Tina Rod.  °Ü°<br/>\n<br/>\nDysfunctional Domestic Diva<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":184851440,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;poey@...&gt;","profile":"raggedymommyof2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: New Member Tina Rod.","postDate":"1136894677","msgId":8948,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTIwMWM2MTVkZSQwNzdkMWEwMCQ1ZTA5NzcxOEBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGRxMThsaSttYzB2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8946,"nextInTopic":8952,"prevInTime":8947,"nextInTime":8949,"topicId":8853,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Melissa, Wow, that s great to know!!

I&#39;m new, I was referred to the list by Ren (Hi Ren!!).  I&#39;m 30 <br/>\nyears old, married for 9 years to my high school crush (we didn&#39;t <br/>\nactually start dating till he was in college, so I can&#39;t call him my <br/>\nhigh school sweetheart), who is in the US Air Force for the past 9 <br/>\nyears.  I am lucky enough to be the mother of two wonderful kids, <br/>\nKyle, age 7, and Nicole, age 4.  We just started our homeschool <br/>\njourney this year, my son went to public school last year for <br/>\nKindergarten.  I have had a facinating (to me anyway) evolution since <br/>\nI started down this homeschooling path as I worked from near total <br/>\nignorance to basic concepts, to overwhelmed by all the options (and <br/>\nopinions) out there.  When we first officially started I had WAY too <br/>\nmuch curriculum, I mean total overkill.  Luckily I let go of some of <br/>\nmy insecurities and we started culling it down week by week and <br/>\ntweaking and adjusting to fit the kids better and better as we went.  <br/>\nBut I still wasn&#39;t happy with it, it still felt &quot;unnatural&quot; (do you <br/>\nremember those commercials?  &quot;That&#39;s not Natural! But Oak Express <br/>\nis!!&quot;).  So as I had gradually grown more and more attracted to <br/>\nUnschooling (at the beginning I feared it), I&#39;ve finally decided that <br/>\nthis is definately the way we should go.  So now I just need to make <br/>\nthe last adjustments, the hardest of which seems to be letting go of <br/>\nthe fears and assumed need for control and intervention.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the reason I know deep inside that Unschooling will/does work <br/>\nis because when I really thought about it, I unschooled myself in <br/>\nmost of the things I know how to do today.  Yes I went to school (13 <br/>\nyears of PS, 1 year of college, 6 months of vo-tech school), but I <br/>\nremember it always seemed to get in the way of what I really wanted <br/>\nto learn about, and I always seemed to do so well on my own (in vo-<br/>\ntech school I only took half of the class, was offered a job doing <br/>\nwhat I was learning at the school after one week of class, went full <br/>\ntime and stopped the class after the first semester, took the <br/>\ncompletion test at the end of the year and not only passed, I made <br/>\nthe highest grade out of all the students who had taken the whole two <br/>\nyear class).  So I know it works because I&#39;ve seen it in myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I do still have issues with, I don&#39;t know if anyone else <br/>\nhere has a problem with this, is my husband.  He does not get on <br/>\nboard with the unschool/homeschool/child led/natural child <br/>\nrearing/etc.  He was raised by very strict, borderline abusive <br/>\nparents, and he tends to get very loud/angry/negative.  I&#39;m working <br/>\nwith him, trying to get him to come around, but still it&#39;s <br/>\nchallenging sometimes.  I know in the past I have been what I feel <br/>\nnow is a &quot;bad&quot; parent, partly because growing up and everything I&#39;ve <br/>\never known is you do what your parents did, what you are told, you <br/>\ndon&#39;t go against the &quot;flow&quot;, and I&#39;ve just in the past few years <br/>\nbegun to wake up and realize I don&#39;t have to do things these ways, I <br/>\ncan strike my own path and do what feels right to me.  My biggest <br/>\nproblem is I have an utter lack of support.  So I&#39;m working on giving <br/>\nmyself the confidence and approval I thought I needed from others, <br/>\nand building up a strong character that can put up with the comments <br/>\nfrom others.  Heck, where I am, people think I&#39;m nuts because I can <br/>\nactually stand to be around my kids for more than 3 hours!!  Can you <br/>\nbelieve that??  My neighbors actually stopped talking to me because <br/>\nthey thought I was weird that I spend all day with my kids and <br/>\nactually enjoy it!!  I&#39;m not going to question a mom on her choices <br/>\nfor her family, but why do they think it&#39;s any business of theirs or <br/>\na problem of mine that I spend time with my kids and like it??  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, so we are just starting the unschooling part of our <br/>\nadventure, or rather the full unschooling part.  We have been taking <br/>\nlong breaks during the day where we build puppet theaters and make <br/>\npuppet shows, create new games, build an obstacle course that goes <br/>\nthrough the livingroom, kitchen, and dining room, built lightsabers <br/>\nout of paper, etc.  In fact, those things actually derailed <br/>\nour &quot;scheduled homeschool&quot; to the point we are about three weeks <br/>\nbehind, although that won&#39;t matter any more.  I look forward to <br/>\ntossing the books and discovering where the children will take us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and if it&#39;s important, I live in southwest Oklahoma, but we will <br/>\nbe moving to central OK sometime this fall when my husband gets out <br/>\nof the military.  I like cats and dogs, although I&#39;m more partial to <br/>\ncats.  I love to read, watch movies, stimulating tv, some junk tv, <br/>\nemail, groups, surfing the internet, playing The Sims (original and <br/>\n2), cooking (or actually more baking), some crafts, learning new <br/>\nthings all the time, playing board games, attempting to clean up/out <br/>\nmy house, and a whole bunch of other stuff I can&#39;t think of at the <br/>\nmoment.  I&#39;m nowhere near perfect in anyway, I tend to have long <br/>\nrunon sentences (and long commentaries in parenthesis that may <br/>\npertain to the topic or might just be a mindless wandering thought), <br/>\nI&#39;m a little of this and that and defy most labels, I&#39;m lost, looking <br/>\nfor like minded people and yet at the same time realizing that as a <br/>\nunique person I can settle for common threads.  I&#39;m mathmatically <br/>\nchallenged except where it comes to money, I love to write email but <br/>\nnot letters, I have 40 years of National Geographics that I inherited <br/>\nfrom my Great Aunt (and I intend to read them all, eventually).  Most <br/>\nof that probably isn&#39;t relavent in anyway, but there it is <br/>\nnonetheless.  Also, I&#39;m a much better speller when I&#39;m sending email <br/>\nfrom my outlook express, as I have spell check.  ;)  Oh, and if any <br/>\nof this doesn&#39;t make sense, I&#39;m running on little sleep at the <br/>\nmoment, so that&#39;s why.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m glad to be a part of the group!!  I look forward to <br/>\nmeeting you all!!<br/>\n<br/>\nTina Rod.<br/>\n<br/>\nDysfunctional Domestic Diva</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8755,"nextTopicId":8992}}
