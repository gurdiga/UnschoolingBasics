It can be <br/>\n&gt; exhausting answering the same questions---but that&#39;s not a problem, <br/>\n&gt; really. We&#39;ve gotten pretty good at it and can almost do it in our <br/>\n&gt; sleep---PLUS it solidifies unschooling to *us* when we put the same <br/>\n&gt; thoughts into words over and over. That also makes it easier to <br/>\n&gt; defend/explain when we have to deal with in-laws, extended family, <br/>\n&gt; neighbors, strangers, etc. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   But when people want to attack the list---THAT THEY JOINED <br/>\n&gt; VOLUNTARILY---well, that just gets old.

I got tanked up and had to step away to kind of find my own unschooling flow.  I have come back to get tanked up again and find it interesting that there is another thread about how people are feeling about how things are said in this group.  When I first joined I remembering questioning the very same thing although I find it hard to get offended especially when I have asked for advice.  However, this list is needed and I would truly be struggling if it were not for all the people in this group who have helped me and mine.  It has been reiterated time and time again through this thread that it is all voluntary.  I have come to learn that passion is a good thing especially when it comes to something that is life transforming for the better.  I guess my word for many of you would be passionate.  How can you really make something happen if there is no passion?  I don&#39;t think I would believe anything you all were saying if you were not passionate about unschooling and especially RU.  The other way that I describe you all is Child Advocates.  I have no problems with people who are advocating for a better life for children.  The world is a better place because of people like you.

An easier method of getting to  <br/>\nprinciples from rules is to ask yourself &quot;Why not?&quot; and say yes more  <br/>\nrather than, as you found out, basically saying they can do whatever  <br/>\nthey want.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour boys&#39; reactions are why people say kids need strict limits! ;-)  <br/>\nWhen limited kids are given no limits they do tend to go wild! But  <br/>\nkids who&#39;ve had no arbitrary limits all along have no more reason to  <br/>\ngo wild than (reasonable) adults do. <br/>\n <br/>\nActually, this is where I&#39;ve had a hard time letting go of saying no.  I&#39;ve<br/>\neased up considerably<br/>\nbut I&#39;ve had a hard time just letting things be (at times) I do still say no<br/>\nonce in a while, mostly<br/>\nwhen it involves my old parental ideas of too much of something (too much<br/>\nsnacks, for one) or<br/>\n sitting back and letting them stay up all night---I&#39;ve had a hard time with<br/>\nthat---basically, I tell them<br/>\nit&#39;s time to go to bed--but they can keep the tv on if they are quiet---and<br/>\nas soon as they think I am asleep<br/>\nthey get up and play---which I haven&#39;t stopped them unless they get too loud<br/>\nor rowdy.  I guess the problem <br/>\nis that they think they are getting away with something, rather than knowing<br/>\nthat I am allowing it by not interfering.<br/>\nIf they know that I am (relatively) ok with it, maybe it wouldn&#39;t be that<br/>\nbig a deal anymore?   I would prefer that they sleep at<br/>\n night, however--but that is just my hangup I have to get over. <br/>\n<br/>\n . &gt; It&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  as if they see that mom is backing off and they are just testing to  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; see how<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  far they can go before they get me to say no or become angry.<br/>\n<br/>\n &gt;&gt; I&#39;d say yes, that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing. It&#39;s a reaction to being  <br/>\n &gt;&gt; limited. It&#39;s a reaction to having the limits disappear all of a sudden.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>They haven&#39;t all totally disappeared at once---but I am considerably more<br/>\nlaid back about<br/>\nmany things.  I&#39;ve basically taken my &quot;pick your battles&quot; issues---tv, video<br/>\ngames, sleep---and<br/>\nrelaxed my expectations on them greatly.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s also as<br/>\n&gt; if they WANT limits and rules and are causing anarchy to get them  <br/>\n&gt; back.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and no.

I don&#39;t care what you do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey may feel like they want the stability of the limits and rules  <br/>\nbut what they really want is stability. Since their *only experience*  <br/>\nis rules and no rules, they&#39;re going to think at least the stability  <br/>\nof rules feels good. If you&#39;d only experienced rotten fruit and  <br/>\nunripe fruit, you might think unripe was better. But that&#39;s not the  <br/>\nonly two choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd fortunately rules and no rules aren&#39;t the only choices! :-)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nOne day my 7 year old was upset about a clay figure he had made- -he had<br/>\naccidentally stepped <br/>\non it and ruined it.  He was nearly crying and I was comforting him and he<br/>\nsaid he wished he could swear.<br/>\nI told him---go ahead.  So, he looked at me with big eyes, astounded that I<br/>\nwould say it&#39;s ok and with a big grin said &quot;shit!&quot;  <br/>\nI laughed and asked him if he felt better--he said yes.  I told him that I<br/>\nwould prefer he not swear---just like he prefers that I don&#39;t<br/>\nswear---but if he felt the need to do so, then come and talk to me.  Now,<br/>\neveryone in a while, he&#39;ll come up to me and say--mom I need to swear<br/>\nand I&#39;ll talk to him about what happened--after we talk about it and he gets<br/>\nit out I&#39;ll ask if he still feels the need to swear, sometimes<br/>\nhe does and sometimes he doesn&#39;t.  I guess that shows that somethings are<br/>\nworking!!??<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; try not to react, or if I do react I just say--thats not nice, why  <br/>\n&gt; would you<br/>\n&gt; need to talk to me like that???<br/>\n<br/>\n &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That statement and question puts them in control. They&#39;re feeling  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>upset so maybe their goal *is* to be not nice! It&#39;s natural to be  <br/>\nirritable to others when we feel irritable. And it doesn&#39;t matter why  <br/>\nthey&#39;re feeling like they need to treat you like that. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nYes, you are absolutely right, I didn&#39;t even look at it that way.  I guess I<br/>\nwas thinking<br/>\nI was taking a more &quot;gentle&quot; approach but instead I was making myself a<br/>\nvictim--which<br/>\nis certainly the wrong approach to take.  I can be firm without being harsh<br/>\nand commanding. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Give them information. Stand up for yourself but then move onto  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>meeting their needs. Say in an informational tone, &quot;I don&#39;t like to  <br/>\nbe treated that way, now what is it you want,&quot; or, &quot;I can&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand you when you&#39;re screaming at me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTell them up front this isn&#39;t working and you want to find a way to  <br/>\nhelp this work for everyone. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI guess my problem is that I&#39;ve been taking this upon myself to do without<br/>\nincluding the boys<br/>\nin the plan.  Instead of communicating that this is a &quot;life&quot; change we are<br/>\ndoing for the betterment<br/>\nof everyone, I&#39;ve just tried to change my behavior and approaches to things<br/>\nwithout including them<br/>\nin the plans.  In order for this to work, everyone needs to be part of the<br/>\nplan. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Having all the dishes disappear is a real life limitation. Think  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>about it as a contract. They can eat in their rooms *if* they bring  <br/>\ntheir dishes back. It&#39;s not a rule to be enforced. It&#39;s an agreement.  <br/>\nYou can bring food to them, but then make it your own responsibility  <br/>\nto go get the dishes. If they take food to their rooms and can&#39;t  <br/>\nremember to bring their dishes back, then they need to eat in the  <br/>\nkitchen. Unlike a mom-rule it&#39;s always open to them trying to live up  <br/>\nto the contract if they want to try again. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is really more of an issue with the 14 year old.  The younger boys will<br/>\nask, can we eat upstairs and<br/>\nI&#39;ll say yes, as long as you bring your dishes down, which they generally<br/>\ndo---sometimes they need a<br/>\ngentle reminder.  The 14 year old doesn&#39;t ask, which is fine, but when I&#39;m<br/>\ndoing the dishes and notice that 3 of <br/>\nmy bowls are missing and 5 glasses, I&#39;ll ask him to get the stuff out of his<br/>\nroom and he&#39;ll bring me one of each<br/>\nand tell me that&#39;s all there is.  I know the stuff isn&#39;t anywhere else, so<br/>\nI&#39;ll ask him one more time to check and he&#39;ll<br/>\nget mad and say there are no more dishes in his room.  From that point I<br/>\nusually either try to reason with him (I have 6 bowls, and <br/>\n3 are missing and no one else has them so maybe they are in your room but<br/>\nyou missed them?)  he then gets angry and says<br/>\nI never believe him---which is true because he does lie about it.  Finally,<br/>\nI had enough the other day, after calling for dishes, everyone<br/>\nbrought stuff down from their rooms.  I knew he had a lot more in his room<br/>\nthan he brought down so I nicely asked him to go check again.  <br/>\nHe refused so I asked if I could go look, maybe a fresh set of eyes would<br/>\nhelp.  He said FINE, but then said to me that I would be <br/>\n sorry when I saw that there was nothing in there and didn&#39;t believe him.  I<br/>\nwent in his room, and I found all the dishes I was missing<br/>\nand then some!  The real problem is, they weren&#39;t hidden or shoved under<br/>\nstuff that would make it hard for him to find, they were all <br/>\nright out in the open, he couldn&#39;t miss them.  So, why bring down some and<br/>\nsay there is no more when he easily could have just<br/>\nbrought down all and avoided all of this.  I just grabbed everything and<br/>\ntook it all downstairs and stated again, if you can&#39;t bring down the <br/>\ndishes when you are done, they don&#39;t eat in your room.  I don&#39;t have a<br/>\nproblem with you eating up there, as long as I get the stuff back<br/>\nso I can wash it.  I let it go from there. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It might be hard to see how that&#39;s different than a rule that says  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;You can but you broke the rule and now you can&#39;t.&quot;. It isn&#39;t a  <br/>\npunishment for breaking rules. But it is like the agreements we have  <br/>\nin society: If you pay for things *then* you can take them from the  <br/>\nstore; *if* you pass the driver&#39;s test *then* you can drive; *if* you  <br/>\nbehave in socially acceptable ways *then* you can stay in the  <br/>\nrestaurant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be hard to see how it&#39;s different than bribery. &quot;If you do  <br/>\nyour homework, then you can have an hour of TV.&quot; That&#39;s using our  <br/>\npower to make someone do what we want in exchange for something they  <br/>\nwant. The two aren&#39;t connected.

The kids need to understand that if they don&#39;t return <br/>\nthe dishes, there will eventually be nothing left in the kitchen to <br/>\neat on.  Returning dishes to the kitchen should be considered a <br/>\nhouse courtesy, not necessarily a rule.  I do understand though.  My <br/>\noldest dd&#39;s room is downstairs (split-level home) and her room is a <br/>\nhang-out place for all 3 of my children.  I never have need to go <br/>\ndown there, but occasionally I carry something down only to find <br/>\nlots of dishes and trash around.  I immediately round up the younger <br/>\nkids (who are the only ones home during the week so they can&#39;t blame <br/>\nbig sister) and ask them to please help me carry these things <br/>\nupstairs.  I&#39;ll laugh and say something like &#39;What a mess!  Can you <br/>\nimagine Claire coming home this weekend to this room?  Are you <br/>\ntrying to freak her out??&#39;  The kids laugh with me and then help me <br/>\nclean up.  Nobody gets angry.  We&#39;re working as a team so the job <br/>\ngets done quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for their rooms, I don&#39;t know how you used to keep order in their <br/>\nrooms before unschooling but my experience with my children is that <br/>\na very messy room is so overwhelming to clean that they simply don&#39;t <br/>\nknow where to start.  I help my kids clean their rooms, usually <br/>\ndoing the majority of the work for my son.  First, I tell them I <br/>\nwant to help clean their rooms that day and when they hit a stopping <br/>\npoint in their playing, to let me know so I can start.  I carry in a <br/>\ntrash bag and then give simple directions.  In my son&#39;s room, I <br/>\nalways start with picking up the books that are laying everywhere.  <br/>\nI actually say it out loud, &quot;Let&#39;s start by gathering all the books <br/>\nand putting them on the shelf.&quot;  My son is happy to do this because <br/>\nit&#39;s simple and easy.  In my daughter&#39;s room however, we start with <br/>\npicking up all the dirty clothes laying everywhere, then move to the <br/>\ncups that have rolled underneath her bed.  *laugh*  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have confidence that my children will be able to do what they need <br/>\nto do when they need to do it.  In the meantime, I&#39;m happy to be a <br/>\nhelp.  Oh, the last time I helped my son clean his room, he found a <br/>\nfunky hip-hop radio station that we listened to while we worked.  It <br/>\nwas fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t been radical unschooling very long though we&#39;ve been sort <br/>\nof unschooly in our parenting approach all along.  However, I don&#39;t <br/>\ntolerate rudeness just for the sake of being mean.  I completely <br/>\nunderstand that we all get into bad moods sometimes, but when my <br/>\nkids start saying mean things to me, I just get down on their level <br/>\nand tell them something like this, &quot;I understand you are feeling <br/>\nangry or frustrated inside, but I don&#39;t deserve to be your verbal <br/>\npunching bag.  How can I help you feel better?&quot;  I don&#39;t let them <br/>\ntreat each other disrespectfully either.  If I hear someone using a <br/>\nreally ugly tone, I redirect and try to smooth over the situation.  <br/>\nFor my son, that usually means that his sister has pushed all his <br/>\nbuttons and he just needs to be alone but she won&#39;t let him alone.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s an introvert and needs to have time alone to recharge.  My <br/>\ndaughter is an extrovert, so even &#39;bad&#39; attention is energetic for <br/>\nher.  She does that on purpose because she wants to &#39;be&#39; with <br/>\nsomeone and when he&#39;s not in the mood to interact, he&#39;ll tell her to <br/>\nlet him alone in his room for a while.  I&#39;ve been trying to help her <br/>\nunderstand that when he asks to be alone, he really means it and she <br/>\nneeds to come and find me when she needs to be with someone and he <br/>\nisn&#39;t available.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want my children to think they can do anything they want <br/>\nanytime they want because that&#39;s not realistic.  We live in a <br/>\nsociety that has certain limitations and expectations and allowing <br/>\nthem to believe they are above those &#39;rules&#39; isn&#39;t going to help <br/>\nthem out in the long run.  For example, it&#39;s just NOT acceptable to <br/>\nhit someone.  The only exception is in defense, and it&#39;s only to get <br/>\naway, not to beat someone to a pulp.  We&#39;re black belts so we&#39;ve <br/>\nlearned that in martial arts.  If my children get physical, I get <br/>\ninvolved immediately to diffuse the situation.  IF they have reached <br/>\nthat point, then letting them work it out on their own obviously <br/>\nisn&#39;t working.  Adults can be arrested for harrassment or assault <br/>\nand battery.  We simply must find better coping techniques than <br/>\nresorting to physical violence.  Why is your older son hitting your <br/>\nyounger son?  Is it to force the younger son to give in to <br/>\nsomething?  Like letting the older son play a certain video game, or <br/>\nwatch a certain tv show?  Is he just bored so he&#39;s trying to find <br/>\nstimulation?  Find out exactly WHY the older one is hitting and then <br/>\nhelp him find a better way to get what he wants than resorting to <br/>\nthe &#39;I&#39;m bigger and/or older and am more important.&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I hope some of this helps a little.  I haven&#39;t been in your <br/>\nshoes so my advice might not be worth much at all.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Hitting a hard spot??!!!

An easier method of getting to  <br/>\nprinciples from rules is to ask yourself &quot;Why not?&quot; and say yes more  <br/>\nrather than, as you found out, basically saying they can do whatever  <br/>\nthey want.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour boys&#39; reactions are why people say kids need strict limits! ;-)  <br/>\nWhen limited kids are given no limits they do tend to go wild! But  <br/>\nkids who&#39;ve had no arbitrary limits all along have no more reason to  <br/>\ngo wild than (reasonable) adults do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; as if they see that mom is backing off and they are just testing to  <br/>\n&gt; see how<br/>\n&gt; far they can go before they get me to say no or become angry.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d say yes, that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing. It&#39;s a reaction to being  <br/>\nlimited. It&#39;s a reaction to having the limits disappear all of a sudden.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s also as<br/>\n&gt; if they WANT limits and rules and are causing anarchy to get them  <br/>\n&gt; back.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes and no. They aren&#39;t used to making decisions for themselves. It&#39;s  <br/>\nscary and feels like you&#39;re saying &quot;Whatever. I don&#39;t care what you do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey may feel like they want the stability of the limits and rules  <br/>\nbut what they really want is stability. Since their *only experience*  <br/>\nis rules and no rules, they&#39;re going to think at least the stability  <br/>\nof rules feels good. If you&#39;d only experienced rotten fruit and  <br/>\nunripe fruit, you might think unripe was better. But that&#39;s not the  <br/>\nonly two choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd fortunately rules and no rules aren&#39;t the only choices! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; try not to react, or if I do react I just say--thats not nice, why  <br/>\n&gt; would you<br/>\n&gt; need to talk to me like that???<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That statement and question puts them in control. They&#39;re feeling  <br/>\nupset so maybe their goal *is* to be not nice! It&#39;s natural to be  <br/>\nirritable to others when we feel irritable. And it doesn&#39;t matter why  <br/>\nthey&#39;re feeling like they need to treat you like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive them information. Stand up for yourself but then move onto  <br/>\nmeeting their needs. Say in an informational tone, &quot;I don&#39;t like to  <br/>\nbe treated that way, now what is it you want,&quot; or, &quot;I can&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand you when you&#39;re screaming at me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTell them up front this isn&#39;t working and you want to find a way to  <br/>\nhelp this work for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving all the dishes disappear is a real life limitation. Think  <br/>\nabout it as a contract. They can eat in their rooms *if* they bring  <br/>\ntheir dishes back. It&#39;s not a rule to be enforced. It&#39;s an agreement.  <br/>\nYou can bring food to them, but then make it your own responsibility  <br/>\nto go get the dishes. If they take food to their rooms and can&#39;t  <br/>\nremember to bring their dishes back, then they need to eat in the  <br/>\nkitchen. Unlike a mom-rule it&#39;s always open to them trying to live up  <br/>\nto the contract if they want to try again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be hard to see how that&#39;s different than a rule that says  <br/>\n&quot;You can but you broke the rule and now you can&#39;t.&quot;. It isn&#39;t a  <br/>\npunishment for breaking rules. But it is like the agreements we have  <br/>\nin society: If you pay for things *then* you can take them from the  <br/>\nstore; *if* you pass the driver&#39;s test *then* you can drive; *if* you  <br/>\nbehave in socially acceptable ways *then* you can stay in the  <br/>\nrestaurant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be hard to see how it&#39;s different than bribery. &quot;If you do  <br/>\nyour homework, then you can have an hour of TV.&quot; That&#39;s using our  <br/>\npower to make someone do what we want in exchange for something they  <br/>\nwant.

In the time that I&#39;ve<br/>\neased up on rules and stuff, their rooms have become disaster zones (with<br/>\nhalf of my dishes missing in them), they are almost constantly in front of<br/>\nthe tv or the computer, rarely going outside to play unless I keep strongly<br/>\nsuggesting it (which I shouldn&#39;t be doing)  They have become rude and they<br/>\nexpect to get what they want when they want it.  My 10 year old thinks he<br/>\ncan just say whatever he wants to me and he&#39;s been hitting his brother (the<br/>\n7 year old).  The 14 year old has been instigating a lot of fights between<br/>\nthe 2 younger boys.  They don&#39;t bathe, and they get FILTHY!!!  They have<br/>\nbecome lazy and sullen, they stay up all night and sleep half the day.  This<br/>\nis not how I pictured unschooling to be---I know there is to be an<br/>\nadjustment period and a deschooling period--for all of us, but it&#39;s getting<br/>\nso bad that at times that I just want to put them back into school so I can<br/>\nhave a moments peace!  I think the thing that bothers me the most is the<br/>\nfact that they are all becoming very rude and mean.  Is this normal???  It&#39;s<br/>\nas if they see that mom is backing off and they are just testing to see how<br/>\nfar they can go before they get me to say no or become angry.  It&#39;s also as<br/>\nif they WANT limits and rules and are causing anarchy to get them back.  I<br/>\ntry not to react, or if I do react I just say--thats not nice, why would you<br/>\nneed to talk to me like that???  It&#39;s like they don&#39;t care.  They weren&#39;t<br/>\nlike this when every minute of their lives were structured and bogged down<br/>\nwith rules and expectations.  Please. tell me this is normal and will<br/>\npass---if it isn&#39;t/doesn&#39;t I&#39;m afraid we won&#39;t make it as an unschooling<br/>\nfamily!!!  Oh, and I&#39;m not so worried about the TV/video games and stuff, I<br/>\nexpected that---it&#39;s more their attitudes, fighting and rudeness that I am<br/>\nworried about everyday.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13094,"nextTopicId":13820}}
