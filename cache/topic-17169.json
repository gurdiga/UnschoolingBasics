My wife, six year old daughter <br/>\n(born December 2000), and I are running an unschooling sustainable <br/>\nliving community in south India. We are looking for like-minded <br/>\npeople to join us (on a short term or long-term basis). <br/>\n<br/>\nWe moved here in 2003 and designed an eco-friendly way of life <br/>\nincluding alternative construction, solar energy, water resource <br/>\nmanagement, and composting toilets so that we could raise our <br/>\ndaughter in a true unschooling environment. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe call the project Sadhana Forest and the main objective is to <br/>\ncreate a natural learning environment while reforesting 70 acres of <br/>\nseverely damaged land in Tamil Nadu, India. We are re-creating the <br/>\nindigenous forest of our area, the Tropical Dry Evergreen Forest. <br/>\nThis forest type is found only in South India and Sri Lanka and <br/>\nprovides a rare biological richness due to its very high species <br/>\nabundance but it is now close to extinction as only 0.01% survives. <br/>\nThis is a last moment effort to keep this very rich and beautiful <br/>\nForest on earth. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn exchange for volunteering, we provide free facilities such as <br/>\naccommodation, a small swimming pool, a small collection of books, <br/>\ndaily yoga class, and the use of several bicycles. Examples of <br/>\ncommunity work include: Tree planting, indigenous plant nursery, <br/>\ncontour bunding, organic gardening, fence building and installing, <br/>\ncompost and soil management with Effective Microorganisms (EM). <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease contact me if your family is interested in joining us for a <br/>\nvacation or for a longer-term stay, and feel free to share this with <br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorking for unschooling,<br/>\n<br/>\nYorit and Aviram Rozin<br/>\n<br/>\nSadhana Forest<br/>\nAuroville <br/>\nTamil Nadu 605101<br/>\nIndia<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sadhanaforest@...\">sadhanaforest@...</a><br/>\nTelephone: 00-91-413-2677682<br/>\nor 00-91-413-2002655<br/>\nwebsite: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.auroville.org/society/housing_s.htm#sadhana\">http://www.auroville.org/society/housing_s.htm#sadhana</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17168,"nextTopicId":17175}}
