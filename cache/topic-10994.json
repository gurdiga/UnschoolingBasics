So, I am going to<br/>\nstart it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday I got up late, around 9:30, started a load of laundry, my new habit, I<br/>\nam a flybaby. Checked my email, made some phone calls... a fellow<br/>\nhomeschoolers had a doctor&#39;s appointment for her youngest and asked if I<br/>\nwould watch the other two and she dropped them off at around 10. The oldest<br/>\nwoke my son up. While he worked on waking up I put in Chicken Little.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile his friends watched tv, we had a discussion about Zombies. We are a<br/>\nfamily of horror movie watchers, but I really don&#39;t know where the question<br/>\ncame from. I answered the questions that he asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir mom got back right about the time the movie was over and by that time<br/>\nmy son had decided he was going outside to dig and &quot;plant seeds.&quot; We have a<br/>\nton of Hibiscus bushes and he likes to break the pods open and plant the<br/>\nseeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he came in he got out his computer game book and picked Chicka Chicka<br/>\nBoom Boom. He played while I went to lay his sister (15 months) down for a<br/>\nnap. When I came out, I asked him if there was anything he wanted to do with<br/>\njust me since DD was asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe spent most the afternoon excavating bones from a Dino Kit and putting the<br/>\nbones together. Then he spent the rest of the time until his dad got home<br/>\nbreaking the rest of the brick to tiny bits. We cleaned up and then he<br/>\npainted the Saber Tooth Cat with water paints.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we are watching Shaun of the Dead because it was the least scary Zombie<br/>\nmovie since DS was asking again and again to watch a Zombie movie. DH and DS<br/>\nare watching in the kitchen and discussing the movie while playing blocks on<br/>\nthe kitchen table.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\nMother of Quentin (5 1/2) and Xandra (15 months)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zenmomma@...\">zenmomma@...</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, March 24, 2006 3:11 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] help?<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome Sher.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;what is a day in the life of an unschooler like? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Each day is different within the routine of each different family.

There is SO much reading in most of the video games today.<br/>\nCharacters talking to each other, finding out new clues or directions, and<br/>\nall the signs and symbols used in video games.  Also, I have found that<br/>\nvideo games eventually lead kids to want to read other things.  For instance<br/>\nlet&#39;s say that your child is playing Kingdom Hearts (a recent favorite in<br/>\nour house.)  That leads to them wanting the KH players book which is filled<br/>\nwith statistics on all the characters, ways to defeat Oogie Boogie, and sub<br/>\nstory lines that you wouldn&#39;t get if you just played the game.  From that it<br/>\nleads to the child wanting to watch the movie Hercules (for clues of course)<br/>\nand then the child says, &quot;Mom, how accurate is Disney&#39;s version of<br/>\nHercules?&quot;  So you run to the bookstore (or library) and get a book about<br/>\nthe Greek and Roman dieties and the next day your son shows up to breakfast<br/>\nin a bedsheet.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a day in the life of an unschooler.  Video games, movies, books and<br/>\nbedsheets.  I think my big turning point between being an eclectic relaxed<br/>\nhomeschooler and being a radical unschooler was when I allowed myself to<br/>\nplay and create.  When I stopped giving myself, &quot;you shoulds.&quot;  I realized<br/>\nthat many of the things that I thought I &quot;should&quot; do are society imposed.<br/>\nAside from the things that really need to be done (like pay bills, and keep<br/>\na sanitary house (note I didn&#39;t say clean as a whistle LOL!) and keep up<br/>\nwith my business contacts) there isn&#39;t a lot that I *need* to do.  I allowed<br/>\na set of societal &quot;norms&quot; dictate my life.  And my life really isn&#39;t all<br/>\nthat &quot;normal.&quot;  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unschool YOU must learn to have fun too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nCatch our new wave of color!<br/>\nBook a March show!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: help?","postDate":"1143091355","msgId":11000,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR2dGJhcittNnUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGYwMWM2NGRjYiRjN2Y4YTlhMCQ0MDAxYThjMEBnYXRld2F5LjJ3aXJlLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":10994,"nextInTopic":11009,"prevInTime":10999,"nextInTime":11001,"topicId":10994,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Sher.
