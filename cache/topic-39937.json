We will be traveling in June and July when the regular school reopens here (easier all around). I found that there were a number of summer camps in the city (when I grew up, there was no such concept), researched a few so he could probably make some new friends.  I found one such weeklong camp (two hours a day) interesting because they offered a combination of astronomy and yoga. One of my son&#39;s dreams is to become an astrocartographer and so I figured, let us try this one. Yesterday, I went to register for this program and had a chat with the young woman who will be running this camp and she assured me he will learn a lot and I will see a difference in him at the end of the week. I tried to re-assure that I don&#39;t want to see a change in him, he is perfect as he is, I have no<br/>\n learning goals, but just to find a space for him to hang with some kids around a topic that is of interest to him. Her response to me was, &quot;Ma&#39;m, he will learn a lot because here learning is cleverly disguised as fun&quot; ! I wanted to yell, &quot;Learning is fun!&quot; I also realized that how deeply I believe it now even more than before. I didn&#39;t want to get into a philosophical discussion with her because I know that she is used to parents who send their kids to a high priced (yuppie, preppie) place like this needing this kind of assurance. But in any case, I did put him down for the program.

We have lots of multiplayer games and aside from\r<br/>\nthat one son, the rest rarely play alone. This is their choice, not\r<br/>\nmine. The older two have gameboy advances that they bought with their\r<br/>\nchristmas money, that they rarely play, cause they have told me, they\r<br/>\ndont have a cord that lets them play together. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDS (nearly 11) deliberately seeks out multi-player games for the PS2 and\r<br/>\nPS3. The very few single player games we&#39;ve got are still social events\r<br/>\nbecause they generally involved one person watching the other person do\r<br/>\ncrazy stuff - like parking their motorcycle crossways in the path of the\r<br/>\noncoming pickup so they can watch the pieces fly and bounce when it hits\r<br/>\n(it&#39;s a race game designed for &#39;winning&#39; but they prefer to try\r<br/>\nimprobable jumps and lots of crashes because that&#39;s more fun). \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI&#39;d suggest looking into getting the connector for the GBAs - it can&#39;t\r<br/>\nbe more than a few dollars (used or new) since that is now several\r<br/>\ngenerations back (GBA-&gt; GBA SP-&gt; DS-&gt; DSi) Or, look into trading those\r<br/>\nin (at GameStop and similar places) toward getting a pair of DSs (which\r<br/>\nalso should be dropping in price, especially the used ones, since many\r<br/>\ngamers are probably turning those in for the DSi which just released so\r<br/>\nthe supply of DS systems outstripping the demand should be driving down\r<br/>\nprices) - they communicate wirelessly which makes things a lot easier\r<br/>\nand more comfortable (don&#39;t have to be sitting within cable range, can\r<br/>\nget comfy wherever within a pretty good distance). GBA games can play on\r<br/>\na DS BUT they can&#39;t use the multi screen/touch screen configuration or\r<br/>\nuse the wireless (But again, those games can be traded in toward getting\r<br/>\nnew/used games as well - can you tell we do this a lot?lol)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDeb R\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n**********************************************************************\r<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and\r<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they\r<br/>\nare addressed.

But I have sympathy with you regarding your other group. I am on several general homeschooling groups and more and more I am finding less and less in common with the folks there. I am also finding myself cringing and recoiling when I read some of their ways of controlling their kids. I will acknowledge that some of the things I have been guilty of in the past, well except the one gentleman that suggested using food as a punishment by withholding it, but my way of thinking and being is so different than it was in August of last year when we began. I have been considering it time to drop the groups where I do not agree with their ways of handling things. Trying to be a reasonable voice among people who have so many fears about raising their children or dealing things like video games, food, tv time, etc. is not worth my or my children&#39;s time. It does take away from the kids<br/>\n if I sit and try and explain to people that they are basing their information on fear mongering data put out to encourage people to control, manipulate and coerce their kids into being the perfect citizen. They refuse to see it that way. If the discussion were reasonable and well founded thoughts were being used instead of hysteria it might be a different thing. You and I or anyone else who thinks along the same lines are not going to be able to change their way of thinking. That status quo is too ingrained. They are stuck in the mindset of public schooling and refuse to leave it behind. Oh well, my kids are happy, we are enjoying life and taking one moment at a time.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/\">http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/\">http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder, he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement and mystery of the world we live in.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel Carson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":274177100,"authorName":"Vickisue Gray","from":"Vickisue Gray &lt;vickisue_gray@...&gt;","profile":"viickisan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Video games revisited","postDate":"1241616197","msgId":39937,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU4MzkyNS45OTQ2OS5xbUB3ZWI1NDEwMS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39938,"prevInTime":39936,"nextInTime":39938,"topicId":39937,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m curious if anyone here has read this book: Video Games and Your Kids: How Parents Stay in Control   because in another group I m in, they are going off","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-115837108\">I&#39;m curious if anyone here has read this book: &quot;Video Games and Your Kids: How Parents Stay in Control&quot;  because in another group I&#39;m in, they are going off on how video games are &#39;rewiring&#39; kids brains and &#39;how evil&#39; they are.  I haven&#39;t read the book but did find this article discussing it; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://naturalmomstalkradio.com/blog/video-games-and-your-kids/\">http://naturalmomstalkradio.com/blog/video-games-and-your-kids/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis article is crazy to me as what they list as problems from video games, to me, seem more like problems of not being an involved parent;  &#39;kids are missing out on social interaction&#39;, &#39;we are having some concerns about brain development of young children, when they’re playing the games.&#39;, &#39;they don’t even have the vocabulary of kids who don’t play video games.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this one which seems to me more of a control issue then a game issue:<br/>\n&#39;But it turns out that my oldest son was given a Nintendo DS by his cousin, who’s his best friend. If it had been an adult I would have said we’re not comfortable with this, but because it was a child, I wasn’t comfortable with not accepting the gift. It’s brought an element into my home that I did not want to have. It’s brought pushing boundaries, hiding types of behavior, dishonesty, not respecting the limits.&#39;<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve read what Sandra and Joyce have to say about video games and agree that computers are just another tool or resource or a form of entertainment.  None of my kids have suffered from exposure so I was a bit surprised at the strong hatred these other parents had for this stuff.  Am I worng?  This article seems to blame games instead of the true issues of parent involvement and respect.<br/>\n <br/>\nVicki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39969,"nextTopicId":40021}}
