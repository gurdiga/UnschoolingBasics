The extended family is an awesome idea.  My oldest wishes to live in Europe but would like us to build a house big enough to house her (and her future family) when they are in the states.  My youngest (8) plans on living on our twenty acre farm for the rest of his life and has already told us that he plans to care for us as we care for his grandmother.   We really need to get that bigger house built.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle Leifur Reid &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamperedmichelle@...\">pamperedmichelle@...</a>&gt; wrote:          On 10/2/06, Vickisue Gray &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vickisue_gray@...\">vickisue_gray@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have two teenager girls that I have talked extensively to.
