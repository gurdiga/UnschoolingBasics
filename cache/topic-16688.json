I think a great way<br/>\nto get a feel for day-to-day stuff is to read at unschoolers blogs. If<br/>\nyou visit our &quot;links&quot; here at the site, there are a LOT of blogs<br/>\nlisted to peruse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just reading all the funshop presenters for the Live and Learn<br/>\nconference today and sat here thinking &quot;WOW, there are SO many cool<br/>\nand interesting people that unschool.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI already knew that...truly. But to have so many descriptions in one<br/>\nplace reminds you of what a hugely diverse mass of people unschoolers<br/>\nare. Very cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16642,"nextTopicId":16626}}
