I did this with my son <br/>\nin the house. It wasn&#39;t much money, but it made a difference as we <br/>\nneeded very little when the kids were young. We lived in a school bus <br/>\nfor a few months, at another time traded labor for rent on a tiny cabin. <br/>\nWe owned a really cheap property with a mobile home on it with an <br/>\naddition that was really kind of gross in retrospect. All this allowed <br/>\nus to work less and me to stay home with the kids. We bought very <br/>\nlittle, and what we did buy was used. We did some caretaking - which <br/>\nprovided &quot;free&quot; housing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that they are older I work free-lance part time for my dad&#39;s <br/>\nbusiness as a graphic designer, which is what I went to school for. I <br/>\nwork in the morning when they are sleeping, or at night after dinner. It <br/>\nis mostly pretty workable, though since it is an unpredictable number of <br/>\nhours sometimes it is too much. We struggle a bit at those times but it <br/>\nis much better than many other options. I am at home with the kids and <br/>\ncan stop and help them when they need something. I have been doing this <br/>\nsince they were 8 and 12- they are 12 and 16 now. It helps pay the bills <br/>\nquite often and allows us to afford extras that the kids really appreciate.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe never technically were in what most people would consider a position <br/>\nto be able to afford to unschool our kids. However since it was the most <br/>\nimportant thing to us- we just did it and trusted that it would all work <br/>\nout some way or another. And it has. It is WAY easier now for me to earn <br/>\nnow that they are older, which is good, because they need me a little <br/>\nless and things that money can buy a little more.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nHeather (in NY State)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":197695430,"authorName":"John Cyphers","from":"&quot;John Cyphers&quot; &lt;john_cyphers@...&gt;","profile":"john_cyphers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Boo hoo hoo","postDate":"1249103575","msgId":40853,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg1MGlzbisydWkxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg0czAwcCtxNm42QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40850,"nextInTopic":40858,"prevInTime":40852,"nextInTime":40854,"topicId":40832,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
