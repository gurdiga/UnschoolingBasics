Both Tom and Jerry and Pink Panther are visual<br/>\nhumor/slapstick.  There&#39;s almost no dialogue in either.  Fairly odd parents<br/>\nand Jimmy neutron rely on jokes and puns and allusions for their humor.  My<br/>\nkids like both kinds but their more likely to loudly laugh at the slapstick.<br/>\nI can remember my son falling over laughing at slapstick when he was 5.  The<br/>\nverbal humor takes a sec to register and then the laughs are quieter.

His favorite cartoons are Tom & Jerry and <br/>\nPink Panther, although he&#39;s now really loving Dexter&#39;s Laboratory.  I <br/>\nthink those cartoons are just classics and are entertaining on all <br/>\nlevels.  We recently got a DVR with our satellite system (supposedly for <br/>\nme to record shows) and my ds just loves recording shows, pausing them, <br/>\nfast forwarding them, etc.  Even my 16mo is learning how to use the <br/>\nremote and pause shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristie<br/>\n<br/>\naplan4life wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;m interested in knowing if anyone elses children laugh harder at the<br/>\n&gt; oldies than they do at the newer cartoons.
