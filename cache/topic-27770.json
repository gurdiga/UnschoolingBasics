Eastern Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nShe  wants to lay in my bed, hug on me (which<br/>\nI love) but then she doesn&#39;t get  anything done and I will not allow<br/>\nthose rabbits to sit out there hungry  and thirsty while she gets her<br/>\ntummy filled.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nJust focusing on the rabbits.  I see that your concern is that the  rabbits <br/>\nneed to be fed.  Your daughter has other things on her mind, which  she is 7 <br/>\nand will probably take reminding.  I am assuming that the rabbits  are something <br/>\nshe wants to do.  If she takes care of them around  the same time each day <br/>\nthen they will be fine.  They don&#39;t know what  she is doing, that she is eating, <br/>\nsnuggling, playing.   Also what we  have here are the automatic water and <br/>\nfood dispensers.  So we don&#39;t have to  worry about them, and can go on vacations <br/>\netc, without concern.  That might  be something to consider as well.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think looking at things from both sides helps.  When my boys want  <br/>\nsomething and I want something different, it helps to step back look at the  <br/>\nsituation, try to understand each other&#39;s wants and needs and work out a  solution that <br/>\nis agreeable to all of us.  I am sure if you think about it  more you could <br/>\ncome up with other solutions as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nWelcome to unschooling!!  You should try to find at  least one other <br/>\nunschooling family near you to hang out with, talk to etc.   It is so nice.  But the <br/>\nwhole change in your thought process can be a  little overwhelming for some <br/>\npeople.  And it can be hard to let go of old  habits.  Just try to think about <br/>\nwhy you do things the way you do, is it  because of habit?, what are your <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s thoughts on the topic  etc. ?   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPam  G<br/>\n<br/>\nOur Blogs:<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/_\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/)\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/_\">http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/)\">http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27725,"nextTopicId":27775}}
