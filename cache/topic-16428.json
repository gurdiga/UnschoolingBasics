It is weighted with water in the bottom and is <br/>\ninflatable so there&#39;s little chance of an injury punching wrong on <br/>\nthat one, it&#39;ll just wiggle or shift or give - DS will sometimes <br/>\npound it hard enough to knock it over even. The other is more like <br/>\na &quot;peanut bag&quot; that a boxer would use for speed. But, it is on a <br/>\nstand, not hanging. Again, the bottom is weighted to hold it down. <br/>\nThe height is adjustable. It is smaller than an adult would use in <br/>\ncircumference - made for kids <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spilsbury.com\">http://www.spilsbury.com</a> is where we <br/>\nordered it - search on the site for &quot;boxing trainer&quot; - it even comes <br/>\nwith kid size boxing gloves. I&#39;ve used both a time or two when I was <br/>\nreally frustrated and it felt really good (I mash my hand into the <br/>\nboxing gloves since it does hurt the knuckles a bit to hit the <br/>\npeanut bag barehanded)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, things like stomping, yelling, and such like can be good - <br/>\nfind a good &quot;stomping place&quot; - for instance, the upstairs hallway in <br/>\nour house is good and loud for stomping, bathrooms are great for <br/>\nyelling because of the acoustics - it&#39;s really LOUD! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, too, things like those blow up clowns that are designed to rock <br/>\nand come back upright could work just fine for a toddler and they&#39;re <br/>\nfairly accessible and inexpensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, what you want is to provide alternate tools to dealing <br/>\nwith the -energy- so that you can then address the situation with a <br/>\ncalmer kid. Kind of like an adult yelling at the top of their lungs <br/>\nabout the &*@#$ insurance company and then getting on the phone and <br/>\nspeaking politely (but firmly) to the representative. Trying to <br/>\nexplain things to an already aggravated person is likely to get <br/>\nnowhere fast - and might even add to the stress of the situation. <br/>\nVenting the energy is like the spout on the kettle - hitting is when <br/>\nthere&#39;s a little tiny opening that whistles loudly because there&#39;s a <br/>\nlot of pressure behind it from the steam. What you want to arrive at <br/>\nis not a little tiny opening but a great large opening to let the <br/>\nsteam out so that it has less pressure and noise.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193844353,"authorName":"Nicole Willoughby","from":"Nicole Willoughby &lt;cncnawilloughby@...&gt;","profile":"cncnawilloughby","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: A toddler question","postDate":"1155219080","msgId":16437,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwODEwMTQxMTIwLjg2Mjc1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMxOTE1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGViZmMyMCtkbTNqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16433,"nextInTopic":16440,"prevInTime":16436,"nextInTime":16438,"topicId":16428,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Google martial arts supplies.

How they look IRL will vary based on age, but the <br/>\nprinciples are the same. For DS at 2, holding hands in a parking lot <br/>\nwas critical.
