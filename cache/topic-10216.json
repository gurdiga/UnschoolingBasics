We probably  <br/>\nwon&#39;t do that this year, but stick closer to home.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt home we have a smaller garden, it&#39;s about 10x20 ft in the  <br/>\nbackyard, the kids plan it out, pick the veggies. Although I nearly  <br/>\nalways wind up working it, they sit with me and pull a few weeds. In  <br/>\nthe front of the house we have flowers, again the kids usually pick  <br/>\nup perennials from our neighborhood feed store. Trickier now that we  <br/>\nhave annuals in there and we don&#39;t want to pull those up.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy reflection garden is something I&#39;ve been planning for three years  <br/>\nnow! Our backyard is a little bit split by the house, there&#39;s a  <br/>\nsmallish section on one side that doesn&#39;t lend itself to play, you  <br/>\nkind of walk though some trees to get there. It&#39;s quieter and such a  <br/>\nnice, cool place in the summer. Every year we plan on doing it, but  <br/>\nI&#39;d like to really do it this year and plant some special things for  <br/>\nDiana, so whenever i see them I can pray for her and Hayden, as well  <br/>\nas some other recent losses (my grandparents, my husbands&#39;  <br/>\ngrandparents, my MIL, my SIL) Hubby is designing a fountain for me,  <br/>\nand actually doing a largish bit of work rerouting some underground  <br/>\ndrainage pipes from our roofline.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to put in a &#39;touch&#39; garden....we have a retaining wall  <br/>\naround our house, that is full sunshine, and I want to put in some  <br/>\ngreat plants for the kids to explore, we all love the big grass  <br/>\nplants, they lend themselves to all kinds of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, we&#39;re supposed to hit the lake and go hiking, and throw some  <br/>\nrocks.
