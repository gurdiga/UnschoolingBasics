And if I try to<br/>\nsimply give him the information that, &quot;well, honey, a boner is when your<br/>\npenis is hard&quot;, he&#39;ll just love knowing that because then he&#39;ll use it for<br/>\nthe exact meaning, instead of just some word he&#39;s heard somewhere.<br/>\nSeriously, he enjoys sharing things like this with the other children we<br/>\nhang around with, and although my friends are all wonderful, I feel nervous<br/>\nthat he&#39;d say to one of their daughters, &quot;i got a boner!&quot; and then I worry<br/>\nthat they think that my kid is a sexual deviant and, blah, blah, blah.<br/>\nHe&#39;s consistently the one out of the group that the other kids are always<br/>\ntattling on, and I see the pack mentality set in whenever anything happens<br/>\nwhere Stone&#39;s concerned.  It&#39;s always &quot;them&quot; against &quot;him&quot;, and it breaks my<br/>\nheart.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I do recognize that my FEAR is getting in the way, it&#39;s becoming more<br/>\nand more clear as I put these words down here.  On the other hand, I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant everyone to dislike Stone, I want to protect him and I want people to<br/>\nsee the amazing person he is, when he&#39;s not so concerned about getting the<br/>\nreaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow, oh how, do I be his loving mama, his supporter, his partner, his<br/>\ninformation provider, and protect him at the same time.  I just don&#39;t think<br/>\nhe gets it, or maybe doesn&#39;t care, about the consequences of some of his<br/>\nchoices.  I feel like I am completely dropping the ball with him, and I had<br/>\na good cry about it yesterday morning.  I&#39;m missing something, I feel it, I<br/>\njust don&#39;t know what or where to start.  Well, actually, I&#39;m going to start<br/>\nby reading something about being the middle child.  I think that Stone feels<br/>\ninvisible sometimes, being in the middle, so then will do whatever it takes<br/>\nto get the attention he needs.  Hmm, guess I&#39;m answering all of my own<br/>\nquestions here, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny similar experience or loving insight would be gratefully received,<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n&quot;When the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know<br/>\npeace.&quot;<br/>\nJimi Hendrix<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35281,"nextTopicId":35212}}
