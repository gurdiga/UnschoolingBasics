Plus,<br/>\nI&#39;ve come to respect the opinions of so many of you and I&#39;m totally<br/>\nlost.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you are an adult and you have younger siblings (like 15 years<br/>\nyounger) how do you watch your parents treat them like crap and<br/>\ncompletely ignore their needs?  Especially after being somewhere as<br/>\nwonderful as the conference, this horrible parenting is standing out<br/>\nso much worse right now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have this gigantic problem, and it&#39;s so much deeper than the above<br/>\nquestion.  I just don&#39;t know where to begin or end.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a mother who I could soooooooo easily walk away from a<br/>\nrelationship with, yet I have two younger siblings (from her 2nd<br/>\nmarriage that no longer exists) whom I care about a great deal that<br/>\nI&#39;d rather not alienate any worse than they already are.  IMO my<br/>\nmother is ruining my little sister&#39;s life!  Their issues are mirroring<br/>\nwhat we went through when I was that age.  It&#39;s tearing me up. <br/>\nEspecially, when I can see a solution!  It&#39;s right in front of my<br/>\neyes.  Yet, my mother is completely indoctrinated with the words of<br/>\nschool officials, psychologists, and well frankly, everyone but me. <br/>\nShe calls me up complaining of horrible issues with my sister and when<br/>\nI offer up advice minimizes everything and suddenly the problems<br/>\npractically don&#39;t exist anymore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother called me today to ask my opinion regarding my sister (she&#39;s<br/>\n14, not eating well, not sleeping well, doesn&#39;t like getting out of<br/>\nbed for school, is EXTREMELY pale, thinner than normal, losing<br/>\nfriends, etc I think the answer is clear :-).  Anyway, you&#39;ll have to<br/>\ntrust me when I say she was not looking for my opinion, yet by using<br/>\nmy little sister as bait, she sucked me in to an argument about my<br/>\nteenage life.  Dammit.  I fell for it.  I RARELY fall for her<br/>\ninvitations to chaos anymore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?  Does anyone have any advice?<br/>\n I&quot;ve have realized that there is nothing I can do to help my sister.<br/>\n I&#39;ve taken great lengths to help her and had them backfire.  Badly. <br/>\nShould I just walk away and swear off her toxicity forever?  I&#39;m<br/>\nreally, really frustrated.  I want my sister to be &quot;happy and<br/>\nhealthy&quot;, but I&#39;m pretty sure this is out of my hands.  OH and too<br/>\nmake matters worse, she&#39;s (my mother) legally blind.  We live a few<br/>\nblocks from each other.  If I DO walk away, I feel like the entire<br/>\ncity will think I&#39;ve abandoned my &quot;poor disabled mother&quot;.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32888,"nextTopicId":33037}}
