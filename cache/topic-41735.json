Thank you to all that posted.  These are issues I&#39;ve been struggling with and reading the responses helps me see where I&#39;ve gone off track.  Toby, I&#39;ve had a lot of similar experiences with juggling the kids and facing a husband that&#39;s not &quot;on board&quot; on so many levels and struggling with fear about too much TV/DVD time. I don&#39;t have further insight but want to take the opportunity to rant.<br/>\nAbout TV...I think we just don&#39;t know.  People on these lists have made really good suggestions and talked about great insights that fly in the face of not only media information on the issue of how much is too much (funny thinking about media being a voice in this) but even the medical/scientific/psychological articles.  At the same time information comes out that weakens the brickwall approach to TV, ie the definite &quot;no good&quot; opinion.  So now what...on the one hand you want to create the optimum environment for your kids and on the other hand you don&#39;t have definite information.  Not a place we haven&#39;t been before as parents, especially thinking of the first baby year.I try to calm myself by saying if we don&#39;t have aenough information then the most important thing to preserve during the uncertainty is the relationship with our kids...ie the respect, humbleness, presence, being open.  Does anyone else agree that this is the bottom line...can anyone else rephrase this better for me?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m most on my game with the juggling the kids thing I remember that this is just a phase and it will pass. Then I can laugh during the hard moments and in 45 minutes things are at a different point eg the kids aren&#39;t both asking for me anymore.  Maybe at the worst moments it would be helpful to realize that you weren&#39;t given all the tools and insight you could use and you&#39;ll have to make do with what you know and since at that yucky moment you don&#39;t know the best way to make everything all better you just sit with it and laugh to yourself.  Sometimes just being present quietly or soothingly for your kids or yourself helps you get through the hard part without anyone getting hurt.  So in the thick of feeling like chaos has unleashed that just sitting through it marveling at it and knowing that it&#39;s ok that you don&#39;t know what to do can bring an inner peace and soon the moment will of course pass or an idea will present itself or things will get even worse but then again better.  I try to think about how some of my friends&#39; parents have acted in the face of a hardship and how they didn&#39;t take it out on the kids but actually included them in the process so the kids&#39; (now my grown-up friends) memories of the incidents or phases of time is one of meaningful connection to the parents in the face of the hardship.  That&#39;s a powerful memory of better modeled parenting.  If my kids can have a few memories at least of times that were tough where I remained connected with them and that i was soothing and patient while they cried screamed ranted then that&#39;ll be icing on the cake.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe husband thing [during the bedtime chaos]...oy...sometimes I realize if I get away from focusing on &quot;well if he were helpful and involved things would be smoother, things would be more right&quot; to &quot;this is my reality now, how am I going to deal with this&quot; then I can be more effective, ie the first way of thinking is fraught with negativity that drags me down. The second way is more optomistic.  I can always choose a life without my husband if it&#39;s clear he does not want to change and be a part of blah blah blah, but at this point it was my choice to stay. <br/>\n<br/>\nStill maybe a brainstorming meeting with each kid and husband separately or together would bring new ideas for coping.<br/>\n<br/>\nAudrey</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Bedtime/philosophy","postDate":"1255859691","msgId":41861,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5MjY0NTBCLTI0QzQtNEI1MC04MjhDLTZBNEFGNzU2Qzc1REB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE2MjQzNy4zNzgwMC5xbUB3ZWIxODAzMDEubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE2MjQzNy4zNzgwMC5xbUB3ZWIxODAzMDEubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41860,"nextInTopic":41865,"prevInTime":41860,"nextInTime":41862,"topicId":41735,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Maybe I am rationalizing or making excuses, so tell me if I am..<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son wanted to go to school last year with his big brother. We did not want to pay for them to go to this school for preschool, so we sent him to the public school where we got a discount because he was in an integrated special needs class. The preschool was 2 and 1/2 hours 4 days a week. He liked it at first. Then it seemed like I was pushing him to go even though I didn&#39;t even care about it. When I realized this, I told him he didn&#39;t have to go anymore if he didn&#39;t like it. So he stopped going. <br/>\nThis year he decided he wanted to go again because his cousin is going and his Dad wanted him to have Math and Reading at him which wasn&#39;t happening at home. I didn&#39;t want him to go because I think he likes the idea but he doesn&#39;t realize that he is commiting to 5 days a week, 8.5 hours a day. I wanted him to wait another year when he is at least in 1st grade. I miss him.<br/>\nSo if he wants to go, that&#39;s fine. Except,it does impact the rest of us. Every morning his 2 year old sister gets woken up when I leave the bed. And, many times his 8 year old brother gets woken up too. We all lose out getting out of bed when we want to because he wants me in the morning. Before school, we all just got up when we wanted to. At night, I have this pressure of putting him to bed. He is already feeling nervous when his teachers ask him why he is late to school, so he wants me to put him to bed and wake him early. The bedtime isn&#39;t working because the 2 year old wants me when I try to put him to bed and I end up with one of the 2 of them screaming. Before school started, I could tell him to go play while I took care of her because it didn&#39;t matter if he went to bed late. Honestly, this didn&#39;t always work, but it&#39;s better than it is now. And no, I don&#39;t have help getting them to bed. Bringing in someone else doesn&#39;t help because they all want<br/>\n me at night. My husband says it&#39;s my fault because I chose to live this way, by doing the family bed and extended nursing. I love having kids. I just don&#39;t know how to juggle them all at night. Sometimes even in the day it&#39;s hard, but night time is the worst because everyone wants me including my husband.

Bringing food can serve a couple of purposes in that regard - its a sweet thing to do, *and* its proactive, helps a kid who may get too wrapped up in what he&#39;s doing to remember to eat. <br/>\n<br/>\nForgetting to eat is something my 8yo still does - actually, its something my partner does, too, so I have no expectation that she&#39;ll grow out of it! Since I like both of them a whole lot better when they&#39;re well fed, I make an effort to bring them both food when I notice them being very focused on something. Its a way of helping meet their needs, and taking care of my own, too. *I* feel better when my loved ones are nice to me, after all. Its proactive self-care in that sense. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk a lot about taking care of kids needs proactively whenever possible, I think its worth mentioning that the same principle applies to our own needs, too. Whenever possible its good to do some self-care Before you&#39;re snarling and resentful. With practice, I&#39;ve found that I end up with more energy to be kind and thoughtful as a result - a happy spiral of win-wins, rather than the dreaded downward spirals where mom&#39;s cranky so the kids are cranky so mom&#39;s at her wits end. It takes more effort, initially, just to change the direction of the flow, as it were, but in the longer term, its really easier to be kind and proactive because there&#39;s less overall stress and unhappiness. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: What to do besides watch TV","postDate":"1255602772","msgId":41848,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhiNnRvaytqMTIzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41847,"nextInTopic":41850,"prevInTime":41847,"nextInTime":41849,"topicId":41735,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Read your book.

I guess I feel delinquent as a mom when he is watching so many hours at a time. He has been doing this for a while. I think some people seem to watch more TV than others and I think he happens to be one of them. The main time he stops is if we leave the house for the day. This only happens if my other kids are around and insist on going out. But when it&#39;s  my 8 year old and my 2 year old and he doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere, I try to respect his desire to stay home. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nHere&#39;s my bedtime dilemma<br/>\n <br/>\nOf my 4 kids,  my 11 year old and 5 year old have chosen to go to school. (My husband does not agree with unschooling) So, tonight while my husband is gone at a business dinner, I try to put the 5 year old to bed, so he can wake up on time for the morning. Before he every went to school, I would lay with him so he could fall asleep, but this usually happened at 10:00 when I was going to bed, or if it was earlier he fell asleep very quickly because he was tired. So now when I try to put him in bed at 8:00 and he isn&#39;t tired, he won&#39;t go to bed. I can lay with him for 10 minutes or so in addition to the bookreading and teethbrushing, but then I want to get up and do other things. Also, my other kids also want my attention snuggling and for some reason they all want me separately. I keep thinking to myself, why can&#39;t they enjoy me at different times of the day? Why only at night? Why can&#39;t they all snuggle me together? None of these work. Tonight, I was<br/>\n especially frustrated because I realized that  I am helping my son and my husband who are into the school thing by puttng my son to bed, while I don&#39;t care  if he stays up late and is late for school the next day (It&#39;s kindergarten!). <br/>\n <br/>\nI realize now the idea I have in my head. I believe that if someone wants something, I am willing to help them if I see effort on their part. I am not willing to take the entire burden on myself. In this case, if my son wants to go to school, he has to be willing to try to fall asleep on his own, if he hasn&#39;t fallen asleep after I have snuggled with him for 10 minutes, I even told him that I would check back up on him every 10 minutes or so to see how he is doing. What is wrong with this thinking?<br/>\n <br/>\nI know this is also an issue between my husband and me, because my son wouldn&#39;t be in school if not for my husband.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe underlying feeling I seem to have is resentment, frustration about having to do something I do not want to do at all. I&#39;m trying to figure out why..<br/>\n <br/>\nHere&#39;s another question? In general, I don&#39;t force my kids to do anything, so aren&#39;t I allowed to say no to things that I don&#39;t feel like doing? <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for any feedback.<br/>\n <br/>\nToby<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nAn aside: I don&#39;t get on the computer but once a day or so for a few minutes. I realize this is because we are 6 people with one computer and the kids get it before me. I thought I would model doing other stuff with my life without being on the computer and TV so much. My outdated ideas about not having too much technology in the house needs to be put aside so we can get at least another in the house. I see that I was wrong. I will still do other things, but it is impractical for us to live with only one when the computern has so many purposes: videos, video games, recipes, e-mail,  information, maps, weather to name a few.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Wed, 10/14/09, plaidpanties666 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meredith@...\">meredith@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: plaidpanties666 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meredith@...\">meredith@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: What to do besides watch TV<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Wednesday, October 14, 2009, 7:30 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com, Toby Rosenberg &lt;philipntoby@ ....&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;On the one hand, I want to be near my kids and on the other hand, the noise of the TV constantly going bugs me.

There are a couple shows that grate on my nerves more than others - the Eds really bug me, for instance, both the show and the game. Not just the sounds but the animation is more... jittery or something. I don&#39;t know. But I try to stay farther from the tv when that&#39;s on, and out of the room as much as possible. Other shows I enjoy, too, no problem. Certain shows I had to sort of &quot;ease&quot; into, as it were, watching bits and pieces and paying more attention to my kid than the screen. It took me awhile to like Spongebob, for instance, although now its one of my favorites. <br/>\n<br/>\nThinking &quot;just get over it&quot; would make Me resentful too! Instead, when I run up against something that bugs me I try to take the time to accept and really Feel whatever it is I&#39;m feeling. Once I actually take that time, rather than shoving those feelings aside to &quot;just get over them&quot; I find its actually easier to tell if the irritation is coming from a physical source or something deeper, some other emotional issue. It its physical I can look for physical solutions - turn the volume down, move away from the tv a little more, or out of the direct line from the speakers. Sometimes I&#39;m a little more physically sensitive due to hormones than at other times, so I can notice that, and do things like make sure I eat and get enough vitamins so I&#39;m not operating on low resources. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I think to myself why should I prepare them an evening snack when a: they can do it themselves b: I&#39;ve already served dinner c: I&#39;ve cleaned everything up by myself with no help (notice the resentment) d: I don&#39;t feel like it, I just want to lay down and read my book.

There are a couple shows that grate on my nerves more than others - the Eds really bug me, for instance, both the show and the game. Not just the sounds but the animation is more... jittery or something. I don&#39;t know. But I try to stay farther from the tv when that&#39;s on, and out of the room as much as possible. Other shows I enjoy, too, no problem. Certain shows I had to sort of &quot;ease&quot; into, as it were, watching bits and pieces and paying more attention to my kid than the screen. It took me awhile to like Spongebob, for instance, although now its one of my favorites. <br/>\n<br/>\nThinking &quot;just get over it&quot; would make Me resentful too! Instead, when I run up against something that bugs me I try to take the time to accept and really Feel whatever it is I&#39;m feeling. Once I actually take that time, rather than shoving those feelings aside to &quot;just get over them&quot; I find its actually easier to tell if the irritation is coming from a physical source or something deeper, some other emotional issue. It its physical I can look for physical solutions - turn the volume down, move away from the tv a little more, or out of the direct line from the speakers. Sometimes I&#39;m a little more physically sensitive due to hormones than at other times, so I can notice that, and do things like make sure I eat and get enough vitamins so I&#39;m not operating on low resources. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I think to myself why should I prepare them an evening snack when a: they can do it themselves b: I&#39;ve already served dinner c: I&#39;ve cleaned everything up by myself with no help (notice the resentment) d: I don&#39;t feel like it, I just want to lay down and read my book.

You have the opportunity to be a little kinder, a little more giving. You get to be the thoughful one, the one who does nice things for others. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf its a matter of being tired at the end of the day, plan on making that snack earlier, maybe when you&#39;re doing the dinner prep or maybe prep a bunch of snacks in the morning - whatever works best with your natural rhythms. I&#39;m Not a night person, so when my kids weren&#39;t really able to get their own snacks at night, I&#39;d be sure to get them ready early in the day. That way Zombie Mama didn&#39;t really have to think much. It left me the energy to be nice when I could barely focus my eyes - that&#39;s important too!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294879737,"authorName":"Toby Rosenberg","from":"Toby Rosenberg &lt;philipntoby@...&gt;","profile":"philipntoby@sbcglobal.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: What to do besides watch TV","postDate":"1255376818","msgId":41834,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU3NDYwMS45NzIxOS5xbUB3ZWIxODAzMTMubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk2MjU3MS4yOTAxMy5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":41820,"nextInTopic":41847,"prevInTime":41833,"nextInTime":41835,"topicId":41735,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am still trying to catch up on all the responses to my post about TV.

What I&#39;ve realized is that most of my concerns are a reflection of me. I&#39;m going to rant a little here and I&#39;d love to have some input.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve realized that I don&#39;t like TV very much. I think it&#39;s because my father watched so much of it when we were kids and it kept him from being with us. Now I see the same thing in the opposite way happening with my kids. They watch TV instead of doing other things with me.  So somehow I have to make peace with my past and this will not bother me so much anymore. <br/>\n <br/>\nI am trying to spend time with the kids while they watch TV. A long time ago, I decided I didn&#39;t want a household where a TV was always blaring. So we&#39;ve always had a TV in the basement for videos. So now, if I&#39;m going to actually spend time with them at the TV, I have to to do it in the basement. I fold laundry down there with them and that&#39;s been great and I&#39;m going to really clean out the basement.  However, one of my favorite things is food preparation. I&#39;ve started to bring down carrots to peel in the basement, so I can be with them. There really isn&#39;t a good place to set up the TV near the kitchen (there will be in the next house). On the one hand, I want to be near my kids and on the other hand, the noise of the TV constantly going bugs me. Is the answer that I should get over it? Sometimes, when I try to just get over it and give in, I feel resentful.<br/>\n <br/>\nI liked the &quot;cheese and crackers&quot; response. I am trying to do more nice things for my kids. I do see improvement in our relationship. I think this is a hard thing for me. Maybe because my parents didn&#39;t ever do that for me. I nursed my children for many years and slept with them for many years. But now I think to myself why should I prepare them an evening snack when a: they can do it themselves b: I&#39;ve already served dinner c: I&#39;ve cleaned everything up by myself with no help (notice the resentment) d: I don&#39;t feel like it, I just want to lay down and read my book.  At these time I realize that I should do it anyway. Or should I? Why was I so willing to nurse for so long but now I can&#39;t do this? Am I burned out?<br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband does not agree with radical unschooling and so he has not been supportive of my son watching large amounts of TV. This son also has mild CP.. According to his physical therapist, he needs to be active. My husband is worried about this too. However, my dh is not active himself. I&#39;m a very active person, but my son doesn&#39;t want to join me. I&#39;ve noticed that when my son wants to move, he can be very active. When I let him be, he gets some activity, just not on my schedule. So, even though I see that my son is getting some activity, when I see my husband panicking, I begin to question myself.<br/>\n <br/>\nComments are appreciated.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks<br/>\nToby<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Sat, 10/10/09, BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: What to do besides watch TV<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nDate: Saturday, October 10, 2009, 9:30 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTHat is great Camille!<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\nhttp://polykow. blogspot. com/<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/unschoolin gmn/<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: What to do besides watch TV","postDate":"1255224659","msgId":41820,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk2MjU3MS4yOTAxMy5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDE1NjE5NjFFRkFCRjRGNTA4NjdBNTI3RjcwOTY3RjdFQHlvdXJxOTRianZ0bDByPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE1NjE5NjFFRkFCRjRGNTA4NjdBNTI3RjcwOTY3RjdFQHlvdXJxOTRianZ0bDByPg=="},"prevInTopic":41819,"nextInTopic":41834,"prevInTime":41819,"nextInTime":41821,"topicId":41735,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"THat is great Camille!   Alex Polikowsky http://polykow.blogspot.com/ http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/ [Non-text portions of this message have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1897727147\">THat is great Camille!<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":362437716,"authorName":"Camille Morling","from":"&quot;Camille Morling&quot; &lt;morlingfamily@...&gt;","profile":"campaulmace","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: What to do besides watch TV","postDate":"1255223661","msgId":41819,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjE5NjFFRkFCRjRGNTA4NjdBNTI3RjcwOTY3RjdFQHlvdXJxOTRianZ0bDByPg=="},"prevInTopic":41790,"nextInTopic":41820,"prevInTime":41818,"nextInTime":41820,"topicId":41735,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Im a bit late here Im sure, computer problems; but from a Mum who had a concern about letting my son go for it on the computer games etc and reading what the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2067297503\">Im a bit late here Im sure, computer problems; but from a Mum who had a concern about letting my son go for it on the computer games etc and reading what the ladies here had to say - decided to get over myself and let him go.

However, that was right around the time her little sister was born, so I felt like I was in survival mode and it was OK.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months ago, she was having a lot of trouble sleeping.  We tried various things to help her.  The only option that would have helped was her sleeping with us in our bed, and that didn&#39;t work, since between our 2 yo and getting ready for a newborn, there wasn&#39;t room in our queen for more people.  (She didn&#39;t want to sleep IN our room, either-- just with us, and we couldn&#39;t always sleep with her because her sister slept with her most of the time, too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI had read something about TV giving children nightmares so I suggested to her that maybe that was why .  . .and SHE decided not to watch TV anymore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a few weeks, it did seem to make a difference.  She slept better than before.  But now, it&#39;s back to the same problems with sleeping (if only we had room for a king bed!).  Our days aren&#39;t even really different, believe it or not.  I don&#39;t seem them being &quot;better&quot; without TV.  I thought DD might get interested in new things, that she would find more things to engage her . . .nope.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what I am saying that just turning off the TV probably isn&#39;t going to be any magic bullet.  Look at what you are more concerned about-- like the connection with your son.  As some have suggested, sit down WITH him and watch TV.  He may not want to chat, but for some people, talking doesn&#39;t = getting closer . . .some people feel closer to people simply when they see that (1) their interests are respected and (2) that their interests are shared (as in, you watching with him). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only benefit I see with the TV being off is that we just started family movie night.  We ALL sit and watch together (as opposed to someone sitting alone and watching, which is what used to happen).  They get so much more excited now since it&#39;s a once-a-week thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Elena</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":104291387,"authorName":"E. Simon","from":"&quot;E.

You have the opportunity to help him find ways to release  <br/>\n<br/>\nthe tension. You could say, when he&#39;s calm and peaceful, you notice  <br/>\n<br/>\nhe gets irritable after playing for a long time and you have some  <br/>\n<br/>\nideas that will help. (Ask here and people will have some! :-) When  <br/>\n<br/>\nhe picks on his brother step in and say you can&#39;t let people in the  <br/>\n<br/>\nhouse be mistreated and focus on what he *can* do instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We have a 1 hour screen time rule in our family.

No matter how  <br/>\n<br/>\nmotivated you are to want the best for your kids, wanting them to be  <br/>\n<br/>\nother than who they are will feel to them as though you love some  <br/>\n<br/>\nvision of who they could be rather than who they really are.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than pulling him from his video games, add more to your lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you love being active, add fun active things that he&#39;ll find hard  <br/>\n<br/>\nto resist.

By socializing and being present with my kids I know what sorts of things they might want to try, so I can be on the lookout for those things and suggest them. I can create opportunities and see how my kids respond. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, neither of my kids is interested in &quot;sports&quot; in any kind of formal way. My 16yo loves to skateboard and juggle fire - both very physical, but not exactly &quot;sports&quot; in the usual sense. My 8yo loves to jump on the trampoline and climb trees and run around, and incorporates all of those into her dramatic play *and* her thinking process. She likes to move while she&#39;s pondering. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth my kids have free access to video games. My 8yo, Mo, just got a new game on Saturday, so she&#39;s played that a Lot this week - hours and hours a day. She&#39;s done other things, too: jumped on the trampoline and run around and filled the living room with a paper menagerie. She likes to do anything she does for a good long time, so its normal for her to spend a good chunk of time playing a game if she&#39;s in the video game mood. Its normal for her to do the same with writing or paper cutting or programming or building. <br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that there are some benefits to video games, but there are also some real dangers.  We want our kids to be active, we want them to socialize, and although we want to support their imagination, I&#39;m afraid video games are not the best source. <br/>\n*********************<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth my kids, with free access to video games, are social, active and imaginative. Even the 8yo who plays for hours at a time. The 16yo used to play for hours at a time, but has lost interest in games for the most part. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat shuts kids down and makes them obsessive about games is limiting them. You can&#39;t get into a game with only an hour at a time - try it sometime. Try Myst III and see how far you get in an hour (its all problem solving, no fighting). Or if not, think about a really exciting book - do you want to put it down after an hour? Are you crabby if you have to? Games are like that, only moreso bc you get to make decisions for the character. In some ways, it takes more imagination and thoughtfulness to play a video game, even a hack-n-slash, than to read a book. Books spoon feed you, by comparison. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;video games can get quite graphic and violent as the kids get older. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You know its all pretend, right? That&#39;s what my 8yo would say to you ;) It Is pretend. My 16yo&#39;s current favorite game is a skating game - he skates, so it would seem silly, but he says he loves the unreality of it. He loves the ludicrous stunts and the fact that he can fall a million times and it doesn&#39;t hurt. Its make-believe. He enjoys other games, hack-n-slash games, for the same reason. Is all pretend. He&#39;s one of the sweetest, kindest people you could meet. People call and ask if he&#39;s available to babysit time and time again, because he&#39;s gentle and trustworthy. He likes games with a Teen or Mature rating. Even the skating game has blood with every fall. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8yo will tell me if she thinks a game might be too scary for her - she has no reason Not to, you see. Her choices have never been subject to limits and criticism. When we went to buy a new game I must have offered a dozen that she turned down as &quot;too scary&quot; or &quot;too much fighting&quot;. She knows her limits and is capable of articulating them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal of unschooling, wrt things like games and tv, is to empower kids to know what they like, what they really want. Are they stuck in a rut and want something new? Are they in over their heads and need some support? Is this game not really what they wanted after all? When kids are empowered to know their own minds, they can say No to things like violence if it bothers them. Kids with limits will subject themselves to violence if its the only way to get a limited commodity. Its limits that teach kids to passively accept things they don&#39;t want, things that trouble them, things that are dangerous and bad for them. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: What to do besides watch TV","postDate":"1254951152","msgId":41745,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlGRjM4NzNFLUFCMDgtNDNDOS04RUY4LTI5OTVFNDNDRTdGQkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhaW1zdStyOTZzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhhaW1zdStyOTZzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41742,"nextInTopic":41750,"prevInTime":41744,"nextInTime":41746,"topicId":41735,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Maybe Picasso looked like he was addicted to  <br/>\npainting!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When he stops a game, he is anxious and starts to pick on his brother.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Probably very wound up. What if he were creating beautiful sculptures  <br/>\nand when he took a break he was anxious and picked on his brother?  <br/>\nWould you make him stop sculpting? Or might you find a way to help  <br/>\nhim get the tension out?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will probably be other things in his life that cause him to  <br/>\ntense up and be irritable. If he thinks the only way to deal with the  <br/>\ntension is to avoid the activity -- or worse have someone else *make*  <br/>\nhim avoid the activity because he&#39;s too weak willed to do it on his  <br/>\nown! -- he will either walk around tense a lot or miss out on things  <br/>\nhe enjoys. You have the opportunity to help him find ways to release  <br/>\nthe tension. You could say, when he&#39;s calm and peaceful, you notice  <br/>\nhe gets irritable after playing for a long time and you have some  <br/>\nideas that will help. (Ask here and people will have some! :-) When  <br/>\nhe picks on his brother step in and say you can&#39;t let people in the  <br/>\nhouse be mistreated and focus on what he *can* do instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We have a 1 hour screen time rule in our family.

Would you happily stop  <br/>\nafter 10 minutes? Would you have loving thoughts toward him because  <br/>\nhe cared enough to do what he believed was best for you?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My fear is that if we unschool him, that rule would go out the window.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s better for unschooling to live by principles rather than rules.  <br/>\nLive kindness and helpfulness and thoughtfulness. Be his partner and  <br/>\nhelp him explore what fascinates him. If you live by control that&#39;s  <br/>\nwhat he&#39;ll learn. Imagine him taking care of you when you&#39;re very old  <br/>\nand limiting you to a half hour of TV a day because he thinks that&#39;s  <br/>\nbest. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I realize that there are some benefits to video games, but there  <br/>\n&gt; are also some real dangers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mack trucks are dangerous. Poison is dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Everything* has its good and bad points. When people are reading  <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t running around. When people are running around they  <br/>\nprobably aren&#39;t exercising the mathematical areas of the brain.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We want our kids to be active, we want them to socialize, and  <br/>\n&gt; although we want to support their imagination, I&#39;m afraid video  <br/>\n&gt; games are not the best source.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s very very helpful to let go of what you want your kids to be. Do  <br/>\nmake available a variety of opportunities that the kids enjoy or you  <br/>\nthink they&#39;ll enjoy. (Be aware that you only get so many &quot;Trust mes&quot;  <br/>\nbefore they don&#39;t! So use them wisely.) Pulling them away from what  <br/>\nthey love to do what you think is better is disrespectful. The action  <br/>\nsays &quot;I don&#39;t like who you are. I want you to be more like this.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you were very physically active and you overheard your  <br/>\nhusband say to someone &quot;I want my wife to be more learned and to take  <br/>\nmore care with her cooking.&quot; How would you feel? No matter how  <br/>\nmotivated you are to want the best for your kids, wanting them to be  <br/>\nother than who they are will feel to them as though you love some  <br/>\nvision of who they could be rather than who they really are.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than pulling him from his video games, add more to your lives.  <br/>\nIf you love being active, add fun active things that he&#39;ll find hard  <br/>\nto resist. (But do allow him to choose!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Not to mention, the video games can get quite graphic and violent  <br/>\n&gt; as the kids get older.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If there were any connection between video and TV violence and real  <br/>\nviolence, then unschooled children would be more violent than any  <br/>\nother class of children because many of them have no restrictions on  <br/>\nwhat or how much. If you&#39;ve ever been to an unschooling conference,  <br/>\nyou&#39;d know that&#39;s not true. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo, please, read here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLots of your fears have been addressed many times over the years. The  <br/>\nunderstanding most people have of kids are extrapolations from kids  <br/>\nwho were either controlled or benignly neglected. Neither of those  <br/>\nparenting methods has the same effect on kids as building great  <br/>\ntrusting relationships with them through mindful parenting. There are  <br/>\nlots of unschoolers here who have real live teens and grown kids who  <br/>\nhave been raised with the freedoms we talk about here. They&#39;re  <br/>\nwonderful kids who are a joy to have around. My 18 yo old daughter  <br/>\ngrew up with the freedom to explore video games and tv and toys and  <br/>\nbooks. She&#39;s thoughtful and the opposite of violent! This is not just  <br/>\nchance! It&#39;s not luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you try to motivate your children to play sports, or just wait  <br/>\n&gt; until they ask?

And a  <br/>\nsecond language class?<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than pulling them towards things you think are good for them,  <br/>\nfill their lives with fun opportunities. It can very much end up  <br/>\nlooking the same, but it&#39;s less stressful and a lot more fun for  <br/>\neveryone.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":282596530,"authorName":"jlalbums","from":"&quot;jlalbums&quot; &lt;jlalbums@...&gt;","profile":"jlalbums","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: What to do besides watch TV","postDate":"1254940382","msgId":41742,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhhaW1zdStyOTZzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhZ3A5ZCt0cWFnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41740,"nextInTopic":41745,"prevInTime":41741,"nextInTime":41743,"topicId":41735,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have not yet made a decision to unschool, but am considering it.

They&#39;re not even only two things, they&#39;re a bunch of things. Videos of what? What kinds of games? There are genres of video and genres of game just like there are genres of written work. Dickens is not Poe - you get something different from the experience of each. Super Smash Bros is not God of War, so you get something different from the experience of Playing each. That&#39;s important. Its important that you learn to see what he&#39;s doing in its complexity, so you can appreciate it, and appreciate him more!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I think one of our problems is that we have very different personalities. I love running around, being busy with lots of things. He (like my husband) goes at a much slower pace, but I can see that he figures things out for himself. So, the way we spend our unschooling days is by him doing his thing and me doing mine. I always try to talk to him and answer his questions, but he isn&#39;t very talkative.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; 2) Has anybody else had this experience?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes!<br/>\nAs someone else mentioned, it can help if you bring some of your projects into the same space he&#39;s in, be more present for him. Beyond that, you can also do some research on the things that interest him so that you have more and better context for your discussions. The more you can &quot;bring&quot; to the conversation, the better you&#39;ll connect - I don&#39;t mean in the sense of &quot;and, hey, did you know?&quot; You don&#39;t need to tell him more things, but &quot;bring&quot; in the sense that the better you understand what he&#39;s doing, the more you can connect. Do you play any computer or video games? I found taking the time to learn to play a few, just a few games that I liked, games just for me, the better I understood what my kids were doing in games. There are concepts you don&#39;t pick up watching, only playing, and some of those concepts can help you connect.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3)Does anybody have some suggestions of things we could do together that we both would enjoy?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, first I&#39;m going to be stern and say &quot;you&#39;re the adult, meet him where he is&quot;. Okay, you got that part? But its also good to look and try to get an idea of what the intersection of you&#39;re likes and his likes could be. You like to read together, that&#39;s one! Can you listen to some audio books while you&#39;re doing different things? Maybe him while he&#39;s working on his models and you at other times? Can you read something and watch the movie and talk about that? And get the game if there is one, too. Playing Harry Potter games isn&#39;t like watching the movie Or reading the books, for example. What does he make models of? Is there something you can do to intesect with That part of his life? <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can ask him, too. Ask him what he&#39;d like to do with you. My 8yo sometimes comes and tells me what she wants to do with me. The other day she handed me a Spider magazine and showed me a recipe and a craft she wanted to do. The craft involved pumpkins, so while we were out buying a new video game we stopped at a pumpkin patch. She spent more time picking out that pumpkin than she had at the game store... had to look at every single one, pick it up, smell it. It was an utterly charming experience, and I&#39;m not even sure how we&#39;re going to do the craft, yet. Sometimes kids have the best ideas of all. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151505017,"authorName":"carenkh","from":"&quot;carenkh&quot; &lt;carenkh@...&gt;","profile":"carenkh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: What to do besides watch TV","postDate":"1254869225","msgId":41737,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhhZ2hkOSthNXM4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhZnY5Mys1dWN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41736,"nextInTopic":41740,"prevInTime":41736,"nextInTime":41738,"topicId":41735,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I saved this post from Always Learning, because it really touched me, and I thought it was so sweet and simple.
