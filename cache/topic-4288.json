Now she has stated her <br/>\nfirm desire to go. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Last year, I felt there was no way that I could homeschool my kids.  <br/>\nWe had had 2 years school-free and were loving it.  My xh and I <br/>\nseparated and I felt I had to get a job and the kids would have to <br/>\ngo to school.  I told myself over and over that grades and homework <br/>\ndidn&#39;t matter.  That this was a temporary situation until I could <br/>\nfind a way to let the kids come home again.  I was only using school <br/>\nas a babysitter.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, *I* fell into the &quot;do your homework, what are your <br/>\ngrades&quot; trap.  By mid-year, Emily, my oldest was pulling her hair <br/>\nout.  Even with violin lessons (which she was enjoying) she could <br/>\nfind no good reason to continue going to school.  She felt stifled, <br/>\nunchallenged, and frustrated with the system (plus she was not <br/>\nmaking any friends other than the girl who lived around the <br/>\ncorner).  I took a deep breath and told her she could come back to <br/>\nhomeschooling since she was old enough to stay home by herself.  <br/>\nAfter that the other 2 wanted to leave school as well.  I didn&#39;t <br/>\nthink that could work so I made bargains with them so they would <br/>\nstay in school (For Keon it was getting to eat that nasty cafeteria <br/>\nfood for both breakfast and lunch! - GAG!)  By the time summer came <br/>\nalong again, my xh and I were living together again and we were <br/>\nbuying a house.  We tried the summer also as a trial to see if the <br/>\nkids could indeed stay home without killing each other.  Well, it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t a healthy situation for Emily who was having to play <br/>\nsurrogate mother to Keon.  So I quit my part time (low paying) job <br/>\nand became a Pampered  Chef consultant (another part time low paying <br/>\njob, but I love it and it works around what the kids want to do <br/>\ninstead of the other way around!) and we have been so much happier <br/>\never since.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think that going back into school was a good thing for the <br/>\nkids because it showed them that they weren&#39;t missing out on <br/>\nanything.  However, looking back I see that year as totally wasted <br/>\nfor them in so many ways.  It took us several months for the kids to <br/>\nrelax back into free exploration in the house.  Mary Elayne still <br/>\nasks permission to eat when she is hungry.  Something that I have <br/>\nnever asked of them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196090915,"authorName":"J. Stauffer","from":"&quot;J.

The Live and Learn Unschooling Conference location for 2005  <br/>\nhas been changed to St. Louis, Missouri.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s very centrally located, and St. Louis is a gorgeous city with lots to  <br/>\ndo and see. I hope many of you will make a vacation out of this and spend some  <br/>\nextra time in the Midwest. <br/>\n <br/>\nSt. Louis is five hours from Chicago, Kansas City, Nashville, and  <br/>\nMemphis----LOTS to see! St. Louis itself is home to the Cardinals, Budweiser  Brewery, <br/>\nThe Bowling Hall of Fame, Grant&#39;s Farm, a lovely free zoo, a  children&#39;s <br/>\nmuseum, a great science museum, Laclede&#39;s Landing, Riverboat  gambling, and of <br/>\ncourse, the beautiful Arch (with its Lewis & Clark Museum  underneath). It&#39;s a <br/>\nshort drive to Hannibal, MO, childhood home of Mark Twain,  and Cahokia Mounds, a <br/>\nMississippian settlement that disappeared (and totally  peaceful---I love to <br/>\nwalk around and drink up the quiet energy).<br/>\n <br/>\nThe conference will be October 6th-9th. I was petitioned by a large group  of <br/>\nattendees to extend the conference to five days, but we compromised with  <br/>\nfour---so we&#39;ll be starting on Thursday this year. We have some exciting  new <br/>\nspeakers as well as our popular standards, Sandra and Anne. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThe website should be up before the end of the year. I&#39;ll point you in that  <br/>\ndirection as soon as it&#39;s up and operational.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe hotel contract should be signed by the end of this week: I&#39;ll get that  <br/>\nout to you the day it happens, so that you can make your reservations as soon <br/>\nas  possible. If I were to give it out now, y&#39;all would bombard them, and they <br/>\nmight  not have us in the system yet---so please be patient! &lt;g&gt; But we got  a <br/>\nsuper room rate with several huge ballrooms, a great lay-out, and an  indoor <br/>\npool! There&#39;s an hotel restaurant and several within walking distance or  a <br/>\nVERY short drive.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have lots of great volunteers already, but if you have a talent you&#39;d  like <br/>\nto share, please let me know.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m looking forward to hosting the conference again---and VERY much looking  <br/>\nforward to seeing you all in October!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\nConference Coordinator, 2005 Live and Learn Unschooling  Conference<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4287,"nextTopicId":4216}}
