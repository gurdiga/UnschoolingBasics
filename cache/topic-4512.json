The &quot;deschooling&quot;-Time is over.  <br/>\nMy daughter (7) goes to school (in Germany it is illegal to  <br/>\nhomeschool), still, but on the relationship-level, the family-level,  <br/>\nthe home-level... you know, what I mean, we are over it. Trust is  <br/>\nback there were it should be, she is not unfriendly anymore  <br/>\n(remember?!), we respect each other and it is extremely rewarding  <br/>\nthat I put so much effort and energy into this &quot;project&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs some of you might remember, I&#39;m fighting for respect, equality and  <br/>\nfreedom towards kids in Germany. I&#39;m not alone. I think that hearing  <br/>\nwhat I had to say to others – when she accidentally overheard  <br/>\nconversations/discussions with others about this, me arguing for and  <br/>\npeople arguing against this approach, she really *got* it, that I&#39;m  <br/>\non HER side, that I really want us to focus on solutions rather than  <br/>\nwho&#39;s done wrong etc. We are at a point where I can really say &quot;hey,  <br/>\ntrust me in this one, it&#39;s really important&quot;, and she does – just as  <br/>\nyou said. We live our lives joyfully, most of the time, we have  <br/>\ntypical conflicts, but don&#39;t solve them typically anymore ;-) We find  <br/>\nsolutions and my daughter is already very solution-oriented. She  <br/>\ntrusts that this is our first and only approach, and she relies on  <br/>\nit. She starts on her own, it&#39;s already so &quot;normal&quot;. We don&#39;t need to  <br/>\nyell, and when we do raise our voices, we apologize – voluntarily.  <br/>\nHey sorry for what I said earlier, she says – or something. Or we  <br/>\nwrite emails and explain more in depth. Oder we talk about it... I&#39;ve  <br/>\nfound a way to be a guidance to her, but not suffocate her freedom  <br/>\nwith it. I can freely tell my opinion knowing that I won&#39;t manipulate  <br/>\nher and that she wouldn&#39;t let anyone manipulate her anyway ;-) We are  <br/>\njust friends, it&#39;s sooo amanzing. It&#39;s open, transparent,  <br/>\nrespectfull, based on trust...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my fears that this &quot;radical&quot; part of radical unschooling wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nwork with school and all – all gone. It does. So if ever a German  <br/>\nperson writes you again and asks if this is possible, you can say  <br/>\nyes :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe school-Problem, we still have it though. We are looking for  <br/>\nalternatives, and she&#39;s already happy knowing that we are. In the  <br/>\nlong run, if everything fails, we&#39;re gonna have to unschool illegally  <br/>\nor move outside of Germany – which we don&#39;t want, but would, if there  <br/>\nis no other choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took 4 Months! But boy were they intense ;-) It was really hard at  <br/>\ntimes. To all those who are still struggling: keep doing it, it&#39;s  <br/>\nreally worth it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you are all fine as well,<br/>\n<br/>\ngreetings from Germany<br/>\nJohannna<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nUnerzogen! | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dialog@...\">dialog@...</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unerzogen.de\">http://www.unerzogen.de</a> |  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unerzogen-subscribe@...\">unerzogen-subscribe@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77669557,"authorName":"gailbrocop@aol.com","from":"gailbrocop@...","profile":"gailbrocop","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] thank you","postDate":"1104713631","msgId":4539,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJiLjY5YWEwMmIzLjJmMDlmMTlmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4519,"nextInTopic":20743,"prevInTime":4538,"nextInTime":4540,"topicId":4512,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/1/2005 11:40:15 A.M.
