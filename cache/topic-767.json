When he was three or so he finally<br/>\ntold me he really thought Sesame Street was just for babies.   I still<br/>\nwatched it and sometimes if I&#39;m flipping through the channels and come<br/>\nacross Sesame Street I watch even now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThough I had the TV on a lot in the days when he was little he didn&#39;t<br/>\nwatch.  It was his choice, he just wasn&#39;t interested.  But when he was<br/>\nnearly four and had a fast growing love of dinosaurs TNT came out with<br/>\n&quot;Monster Vision&quot; and Dylan discovered Godzilla!  Ah.  He was in heaven.  <br/>\nGodzilla movies lead to other monster movies.  By the time he was six or<br/>\nso he&#39;d seen every terrible old Japanese and Korean monster movie we<br/>\ncould lay our hands on. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also watched Lost in Space, on the Sci-fi channel and old episodes of<br/>\nStar Trek.  He watched Next Generation and Deep Space Nine and Voyager<br/>\nfor the one season we were able to get it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nScience fiction lead to old horror movies and he started a collection of<br/>\nWerewolf and Vampire and Mummy videos.   He loved horror and read his<br/>\nfirst Stephen King stories when he was seven or eight. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had more than one talk with our librarian and the lady at the video<br/>\nstore about what he was &quot;allowed&quot; to check out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has always been free to choose what he wanted to watch and *if* he<br/>\nwanted to watch and I&#39;ve never known him to watch something just because<br/>\nit was on.  He leaves the room if someone is watching something he&#39;s not<br/>\ninterested in.   He has rented movies and turned them off when they<br/>\nweren&#39;t what he thought they were.  He absolutely knows what he wants to<br/>\nsee and what he doesn&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a time when he was little that he believed every advertisement<br/>\nhe saw on TV.  We used to joke that if he ever found the shopping channel<br/>\nwe&#39;d have to hide the credit cards. &lt;g&gt;  He would excitedly tell us we<br/>\nneeded the Downey Ball or some gizmo or fantastic cleaner.  During the<br/>\ntime he was discovering advertising we talked about the products.  Why we<br/>\ndid or didn&#39;t need them.  We did try some things that were advertised and<br/>\nfound them not to be as appealing as they&#39;d been portrayed in the ads.  <br/>\nSome things we liked a lot but some really were a waste of money. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe saw the Hot Wheels Volcano Blowout race track set advertised on TV. <br/>\nHe wanted one so badly and we found out they were over fifty dollars.  We<br/>\nsaved for it and he put away some of his own money until he had enough<br/>\nand we drove the eighty something miles to the store and he brought it<br/>\nhome.  It broke within the first few days.  The little pegs that held the<br/>\nvolcano together snapped off and the track and volcano would come apart<br/>\nevery time a car went through.   It was heartbreaking.   But we wrote our<br/>\ncomplaint to the company and though it took quite a long time he was<br/>\nsatisfied with the way they resolved the issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nHis discovery of and understanding of advertising came about really<br/>\nnaturally through exposure and experience.  The same way he learned to<br/>\ntie his shoes and read, he learned about advertising.   Not in some<br/>\nvacuum of TV land but in his home, with his mom and dad answering<br/>\nquestions and offering help and ideas.  He understood the psychology<br/>\nbehind advertising at a very young age and he understood the reason for<br/>\nadvertising and more importantly he understood he wasn&#39;t the victim of<br/>\nanyone or anything but that he had the power to assess the information<br/>\nand examine a product and *return* a product if it didn&#39;t meet his<br/>\nexpectation.    He&#39;s been an empowered, informed consumer for over half<br/>\nhis life now and I know some adults who aren&#39;t there yet.   I believe<br/>\nit&#39;s because he had the freedom to explore this important topic early on<br/>\nwith the help of his parents.  I believe it&#39;s because understanding is a<br/>\nprocess and we didn&#39;t try to hurry it and we didn&#39;t shut it down, by<br/>\nlimiting TV,  when it didn&#39;t happen immediately. <br/>\n<br/>\nLike riding a bike or going potty on the toilet or anything else our<br/>\nchildren learn, learning the ways of the economy and consumerism comes to<br/>\npeople gradually through experience.  I feel it&#39;s much better that Dylan<br/>\nhad the opportunity to learn these things while he was home with us and<br/>\nwhere spending his life savings on something which turned out to be a<br/>\ndisappointment was a matter of fifty dollars instead of fifty thousand.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan is twelve now but has always had the freedom to watch anything he<br/>\nwanted.  That doesn&#39;t mean we left him alone in the room with the TV and<br/>\nleft him to work things out on his own.  We helped him.  We explained<br/>\nthat movies weren&#39;t real, that people were pretending to but hurt or sick<br/>\nor mean and that it was like a game and no one really got injured.  We<br/>\nacted some things out ourselves.  We watched video about the making of<br/>\nmovies so he could see how some things were made to look realistic.    We<br/>\ntalked about  the characters and why someone would act mean or why<br/>\nsomeone would steal or hurt others.  We talked about what makes a story<br/>\ngood and interesting and why we like certain characters even if they<br/>\ndon&#39;t seem very nice. <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan can recognize formulas in moves and TV programs and predict what<br/>\nwill occur with astounding accuracy.  He can tell you which characters<br/>\nhave to die in the end and why.  He is almost never surprised by movies<br/>\nbut he loves them and loves to analyze them.  He recognizes plot lines<br/>\nhe&#39;s seen before and saw very early on how many of the old Star Trek<br/>\nepisode were based on Shakespeare plays.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to say this about putting parental fears about TV into<br/>\nperspective.  I came to realize that the people my son talked to<br/>\neveryday, the real people in his life were capable of saying  and doing<br/>\nthings that were far more hurtful and damaging than anything an actor<br/>\npretending on TV could say or do.  Dylan understood the reason actors did<br/>\nwhat they did, to earn a pay check, to tell a story, etc.  But it was<br/>\noften harder to tell him why his Grandfather was mean or why his friend<br/>\nwas being hit by his mom.   The woman across the street who locked her<br/>\nkids out of the house after school so they wouldn&#39;t eat all the food was<br/>\na bigger concern to me than any pretend scenario involving a chain saw in<br/>\nthe movies.   Real world things are troubling and have no easy answers<br/>\nbut pretend is just pretend.  I&#39;m still more concerned about the damage<br/>\nmy mother can do with her thoughtless comments about how terrible men are<br/>\nthan I will ever be about a werewolf attack or a Mafia hit or a car crash<br/>\non TV.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here it gets bigger.  I&#39;m more concerned with the damage *I* can do<br/>\nby not respecting my son&#39;s ability to learn and grow and process<br/>\ninformation.  I&#39;m more concerned with the damage I can do by not<br/>\nrespecting his choices and his abilities.   I&#39;m here to help him live in<br/>\nthe world of humans and that word includes TV and advertising and rotten<br/>\nneighbors and warped old grannies.  I can help him be empowered or I can<br/>\nmake him afraid and small and I fear making him afraid or paranoid or<br/>\nsmall more than I&#39;ll ever fear a movie about pretend bad guys doing<br/>\npretend bad things. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":794,"nextTopicId":761}}
