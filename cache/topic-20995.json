A more important point to consider in my<br/>\nopinion, would be that kids started learning a trade at a way younger<br/>\nage, so that they were expected to be able to have a job at 15, whereas<br/>\nnowadays kids are considered kids until they graduate from college at<br/>\n22-23yo. Life is more complicated now than it used to be, because kids<br/>\nhave more choices to make. If at 9yo I start learning to become a<br/>\nshoemaker and it&#39;s obvious I&#39;m going to do that for a living for the<br/>\nrest of my life, it&#39;s a lot easier to be mature at 15yo than if I&#39;m in<br/>\n10th grade at 15yo and have to decide whether I want to go to college,<br/>\nor trade school, and if so, what to major in, or travel across the<br/>\nworld, or this, or that. <br/>\n<br/>\nMarieke<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNever Miss an Email<br/>\nStay connected with Yahoo!
