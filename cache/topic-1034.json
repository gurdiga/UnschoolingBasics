I came to unschooling after watching the<br/>\nway Dylan was living and growing and learning how to do things within our<br/>\nfamily without being taught to do them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was very small he would take his plate to the sink when he was<br/>\nfinished eating, because he saw us doing it.  If something, a toy, was<br/>\ndirty he would wash it off.  He was doing those things as a side effect<br/>\nof living with other people who did those things.   That got me wondering<br/>\nwhat all a person could learn by living in a world full of possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time he was school age I was relieved he didn&#39;t want to go to<br/>\nschool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t separate the two things in my mind.  He was born a human.  He<br/>\nwants for himself what others of his kind want.  He want&#39;s to be clean<br/>\nand safe and warm and fed and entertained and challenged and free.  He<br/>\nwants help when he&#39;s in need.  He wants respect for his process.  He<br/>\nwants all those things without me telling him he should want them and<br/>\nwithout me directing how he goes about accomplishing them.   He only<br/>\nneeded to live among others who were working toward those things and he<br/>\nlearned how to go about it.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOthers don&#39;t need to see non coercive parenting and unschooling as the<br/>\nsame thing in order to enjoy or benefit from this list.   Everyone gets<br/>\nto do whatever they want! &lt;g&gt;   No one needs to feel like what we say<br/>\nhere must be applied in full to their lives.  There is no one going to<br/>\nshow up at the door to enforce this particular philosophy.

I mean, I&#39;ve gotten the feeling that there are at least a few<br/>\nvocal posters who might believe that it isn&#39;t unschooling unless there is no<br/>\ncoercion whatsoever.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes to the question.<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how people are arriving at the above conclusion though, since it&#39;s been repeated over and over that the definition of unschooling means one that is not schooled, and that the other issues are affected simply by the new mindset.<br/>\nIf you trust that children will learn in their own way, in their own time, then you TRUST that. Whether they&#39;re learning about their own bodies, or how to be empathetic and work together as a family, whether they&#39;re learning from tv or games or ANYTHING, I&#39;m trusting in their own inherent capability.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re saying they can learn about academic or &quot;educational&quot; things in their own way and time, but saying you don&#39;t trust them to learn other real life topics in their own way, I think that&#39;s limiting what unschooling can do in your life.<br/>\nI think learning happens best in an environment of complete trust and respect. I&#39;ve seen it happen in my own family, and many others, so I KNOW it works. I&#39;ve been on both sides of this issue.<br/>\nGoing from not trusting children completely, to deep and real trust, has produced amazing results around here. <br/>\nSo again, I&#39;m not interested in saying who is and who is not unschooling (unless you want to argue that a full-time public schooler is unschooled or that lessons at home are unschooling), like Pam, I&#39;m interested in talking about how children learn without these parental controls, what it looks like inside other unschooling families and creative ways to deal with real life issues as they arise, with the philosophy of trust firmly in place.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1035,"nextTopicId":1049}}
