I have tried to satisfy her need for an organised<br/>\nlife by paying for an art course for her which she enjoys and has an end<br/>\nresult she seems to crave - ie a qualification.

If she is creating these<br/>\nfor herself, and no-one is forcing her to keep to them, maybe she just<br/>\nshould be supported in this. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is not about necessarily abandoning everything that looks<br/>\nschoolish if the child is genuinely desiring it, but about facilitating the<br/>\nway our children want to learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever your disquiet suggests that something more is going on. Is there<br/>\nsomething else, some external pressure that she is trying to escape from<br/>\ninto this busywork? Well I guess this was what you were asking for ideas<br/>\nabout.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow old is she again? I mean is it puberty? <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you recently moved? Has there been some other large destabilizing<br/>\nchange in your lives?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you worried that she has OCD? Anything resembling a diagnosis is<br/>\nprobably beyond the purview of this list, but there is a lot of info about<br/>\nthis on line. If you have alarm bells ringing in your heart, you should<br/>\nprobably heed that intuition and do more research.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain I think we need more background to be better able to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

She does this from wildlife cards she collects.  I am worried she is doing it cos she stressed and tbh don&#39;t understand why she feels the need to copy what she is reading and already has in file form. Also I discovered she has made herself a schedule of things she HAS to do each day. ( all in subject headings).This bothers me greatly.  I feel like the unschooling experience has not reached her and she has not taken it on.  She spents much of the day at loggerheads with her siblings over hogging the computer to copy type ( we have two computers and can&#39;t afford another) and refusing to join in their games. I understand she has to do what is best for her but I am worried what she is doing it not really making her happy.   I have tried asking her why she feels this need to school type work but she cannot say.  Any ideas please?<br/>\nRuth<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThis email and all attachments have been electronically scanned by Kingston<br/>\nCommunications&#39; email Anti-Virus service and no known viruses were detected.<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5239,"nextTopicId":5238}}
