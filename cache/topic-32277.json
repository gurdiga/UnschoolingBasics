That meant when I went to the eye doctor last week that I had 2 - 3 year old in pjs, and not the ones I would have picked that are a top and pants and slightly resemble daytime clothing, but the fleece kind with the feet that zip up the front.  I very quickly discovered that them being dressed in something &quot;acceptable&quot; for daytime was much more about my pride and ego than anything else.  It was very uncomfortable for me.  They didn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass what they had on, quite frankly.  *From the child&#39;s perspective*, and especially when they&#39;re this little is no big deal.  It was however, a big deal to me, and like pretty much everything else that comes up these days in this learning curve, the only problem was with *me*.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Isn&#39;t this what unschooling is all about?  To honor them enough to let them be Who They Are in this moment??  In fact, when I took them to a meeting recently in their pjs and said something about it to the group, one mom said &quot;I didn&#39;t have any judgement at all, I just thought, now there&#39;s one smart mom to not fight about clothes!&quot;.  I often put judgements onto other people due to my own insecurities, and that isn&#39;t respectful of either of us.  In baby steps, I&#39;m slooowly learning to not give a shit what other people think about something we do/don&#39;t do, and especially if it&#39;s something that is bringing joy to my children.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

We only used a highchair when he liked <br/>\nit or we really had to (can&#39;t think of any &quot;had t&quot;o situations). In <br/>\nfact we only owned a portable seat, not a highchair. I often fed him <br/>\nin a walker or swing as it kept him happy by keeping him moving. My <br/>\nson was also a sling baby and an EC baby. He loved being with me, but <br/>\nI had to be moving.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also HATED clothes. Even now he has started taking his shirt off <br/>\nagain but I think he is mimicing DH. He is 4 now and it is warm <br/>\nenough that no shirt is ok. One thing to check - is it 100% cotton? <br/>\nMy son did seem to do better in very soft cotton, even organic seemed <br/>\nto make a difference. Making getting dressed take as little time as <br/>\npossible was key too. Easy on top and shorts. No snaps, buttons, <br/>\ntight elastic, rough clothes, etc. Only velcro or slip on shoes <br/>\n(leather mocassin type shoes were his fav.)too. I did let him run <br/>\nnaked as much as possible. When he needed something for kids legs we <br/>\nput babylegs on him. He even wore long t-shirt gowns/oversized <br/>\nsweatshirts to cover his nudity so he coule get away with no diapers. <br/>\nThe more I let him be &quot;free&quot; at home the better he was when we were <br/>\nnot home and he had to wear clothes or diapers. But I was home 95% <br/>\nthe time. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing that popped in my mind is checking to make sure the <br/>\ndiaper is not making the child uncomfy or hot. My son pnly tolerated <br/>\ncertain diapers. But I think for the most part he just enjoyed being <br/>\nnaked. I think he needed to feel free or independant even at an early <br/>\nage. He is still very opininated and on the &quot;go&quot; constantly. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as carseats go, he screamed til he choked/vomited and hated <br/>\ncarseats. It was horrible. No mom I know has had a child who hated <br/>\nriding in the car/carseat worse then mine. Everyone who heard him was <br/>\nworried about him, even moms who &quot;tuned&quot; their kids out. There was no <br/>\ntuning my LOUD child out. Needless to say I cut my driving down <br/>\ndrastically! I did not have enough money to buy a padded carseat back <br/>\nthen. But when he was about 3 yrs old we bought a new Recaro carseat <br/>\nand he has been happy riding in the car ever since. He loves his seat <br/>\nnow. He even surprises me by buckling the top clip and gets upset if <br/>\nI watch him. So you might want to go to a store that has carseats and <br/>\nsee what is most comfy for your child.<br/>\nI know his little cousin is/was an extremely quiet child and even he  <br/>\nhated the carseat my son use to ride in when he was 1-3 yrs old. (We <br/>\npassed ours down to him.) His cousin was under 1 when we took care of <br/>\nhim and he never ever screamed or cried, except in the car. One day I <br/>\nput him in the Recaro and he was quiet the whole time. I used a <br/>\nRecaro Como with the padded &quot;wings&quot; and I was unsure if they would <br/>\nfreak the kid out or not. I was suppose to use them due to his small <br/>\nsize and despite him looking covered up by the carseat, he loved it. <br/>\nI guess he felt safe and &quot;covered&quot; like with a blanket cause I swear <br/>\nI have never heard a child so quiet in the car. I am someone who <br/>\nabides by carseat rules and I keep the straps very tight and straight <br/>\n(not tangled) and if the seat is comfy none of the kids I have taken <br/>\ncare of have minded unless the trip was over 40 mins., which is <br/>\nunderstandable. I also keep the kids rearfacing as long as possible. <br/>\nAnd the kids only complained (rf or ff) when the carseat was the <br/>\nculprit. So from my experience kids can really be uncomfortable in <br/>\ncarseats, even if they are still small enough to fit in it. Sometimes <br/>\nthe angle isn&#39;t comfy, sometimes there&#39;s not enough padding, etc.  <br/>\nJust something to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also tried buying a DVD played for the car because we were <br/>\ndepeserate. This worked for a little while. The thing finally broke <br/>\nand even though it was cheaper to buy another one I bought a new <br/>\ncarseat and my son has not needed a DVD played since. The DVD player <br/>\ndid help the little cousin too but still not as much as the Recaro <br/>\nseat. Every child is different but this was just our experience(s). <br/>\n<br/>\nI am Not recommending a certain carseat just telling our experience <br/>\nwith several different kids that have ridden with me. And yes, some <br/>\nkids never seem to care what they ride in/on, while others- like my 4 <br/>\nyr old son- do. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that helped when we had our older carseat was to sing <br/>\nto him. Only 1 song worked. It took us awhile to find a song he <br/>\nliked. Sometimes the radio would help. SOmetimes movies or kid CD&#39;s. <br/>\nEventually he did get better, even in his uncomfortable seat, it just <br/>\ntook awhile. I don&#39;t know if my son would have been happy in a better <br/>\nseat when he was under 1 yr old or not because his biggest problem <br/>\nwas not being attached to me at all times. He even hated strollers <br/>\n90% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] 9 month old doesn&#39;t want to be dressed??","postDate":"1209571050","msgId":32287,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQTc4RjIwNzY3MkQ4MC0xMUU4LUEzRkBXZWJtYWlsLW1nMDUuc2ltLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDVkYTM3ZTg0MDgwNDMwMDcxNm8zYmVmNzU3OXMzMTQzN2JhZTY1NTk5YjNmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZ2OG83bitnNDdhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NWRhMzdlODQwODA0MzAwNzE2bzNiZWY3NTc5czMxNDM3YmFlNjU1OTliM2ZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":32285,"nextInTopic":32288,"prevInTime":32286,"nextInTime":32288,"topicId":32277,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Seriously. Clothing serves two main purposes functionally -<br/>\nprotection from weather/environment and modesty (whatever the societal<br/>\nnorm for modesty is - wide range there culture to culture) [clothing<br/>\ndoes have secondary purposes in terms of social cues/status/etc but<br/>\nthat&#39;s not as crucial to this discussion] FWIW DS was generally in a<br/>\ndiaper and a onesie and that&#39;s it until he almost 18 months old - pants<br/>\nwere for whenever he was going to be crawling about on something other<br/>\nthan our living room carpet. You might look at your DD&#39;s wardrobe and<br/>\nconsider whether it&#39;s all cute girlie clothing (which is adorable but<br/>\nmight not be comfortable -for her-) or if it&#39;s basic coverage. For<br/>\ninstance, is there lace, elastic, etc at the wrists, neck, etc? (I<br/>\ncannot wear anything with lace touching my skin and none of us can<br/>\ntolerate anything binding tightly at neck or wrist - I actually slit the<br/>\nwristbands on one sweatshirt because I liked the shirt but the ribbed<br/>\ncuff area was too tight).<br/>\n<br/>\nCar seat is a legal and safety issue for sure. Maybe check the car seat<br/>\nitself and see if the one you&#39;ve got has been outgrown - that&#39;s the time<br/>\nDS fought the car seat most is when the fastenings got too tight/chafing<br/>\non him. <br/>\n<br/>\nHigh chair? Why? Is it *necessary*? As soon as DS could toddle (he was<br/>\nclimbing furniture by 6 months), he was kneeling/standing on a regular<br/>\ndining chair to eat. Prior to that, he sat on my lap for meals. I think<br/>\nwe did own a high chair (a shower gift) but by our choice/request it was<br/>\na multi-purpose one that went from high chair to booster to table and<br/>\nchair - it stayed as table and chair the whole time we owned it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be useful to stop yourself and think Why is this &lt;whatever&gt;<br/>\nimportant enough to me to fight about it? Is it about safety?<br/>\nConvenience? Public opinion?
