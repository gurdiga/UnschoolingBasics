Here <br/>\nwas her post - her only post:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;My son aged 3 years 2 months has been watching movies on video<br/>\nendlessly. Today he watched about 5 movies, from approximately 11<br/>\nin the morning to 7 in the evening, stopping only for a short period<br/>\nto get in the van to go drop off his sisters somewhere. I have<br/>\nallowed him to watch all he wants, but to be honest I hate the fact<br/>\nthat he watches so much. So I am wondering, is this normal? Should<br/>\nI be setting limits? Is this a phase he is going through? Should I<br/>\njust let him watch all he wants until he eventually gets it out of<br/>\nhis system?

We didn&#39;t limit his screen time<br/>\nfor 2 years. We had constant battles when we asked him to disengage<br/>\nfor anything, even things he asked us to set up like a playdate, he&#39;d<br/>\nhave a screaming fit when it was time to go.

I never <br/>\ngot the impression that she *made* him stop playing to attend a <br/>\nplaydate.

In <br/>\nfact, the situation she described occurred before she was setting any <br/>\nlimits (which she is now doing for health reasons, not for <br/>\nplaydate-breaking reasons, as far as I can tell).  The original <br/>\nconversation is quoted below:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Did I read in another post that you tried no limits on screens in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; the past?

Even<br/>\nattempts to disengage him to go to an activity that he had asked me<br/>\nto set up for him (a playdate, a homeschool group activity)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen in a later post she clarified further:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; If you were forcing him, kicking and screaming, to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; attend play dates when he would rather play video<br/>\n &gt; games, that doesn&#39;t sound like &quot;unlimited&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, let&#39;s please not put words in my mouth. I didn&#39;t force him<br/>\nkicking and screaming to do anything. You&#39;ll notice I said that he<br/>\nwas screaming when I &quot;asked him to disengage&quot;.
