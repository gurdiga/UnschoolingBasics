If you talked to your<br/>\nson about the bug problem, would he be cool with an arrangement like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mentioned that you have a spare bedroom. Is it possible to split his<br/>\nstuff into the two rooms? Maybe he has things in his room taht he plays with<br/>\nsometimes and wouldn&#39;t mind them living someplace else so the amount of<br/>\nstuff in the room is decreased. Maybe he has a hard time finding things in<br/>\nhis room and when he searches for stuff and finds it playing with the<br/>\nsearched for item(s) becomes paramount and cleaning up the stuff he spread<br/>\nout to find said items becomes less important. Maybe there are things in the<br/>\nroom which are literally in his way. Periodically my guys want shifted out<br/>\nof their rooms. We pack it up and re-arrange their rooms. If they want the<br/>\npacked stuff back, we just get the box out again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that if I give a few minutes to Ethan&#39;s room each day it doesn&#39;t get<br/>\nto the point where we can&#39;t find the floor. If I don&#39;t get to it, then I<br/>\ntake a few hours, crank up the radio, and give it a good cleaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he and his friends could have the sleepover in the spare bedroom?<br/>\nMaybe they can have a camp out someplace else in the house?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thought, who is stressing over the mess you or him? If it&#39;s you,<br/>\nthen you need to think about how to stop stressing or find a solution hatt<br/>\nboth of you can live with.

His room has always been his own, I&#39;ve always respected<br/>\nhis privacy in there and other than asking for a clear path in and out<br/>\nwhen he was younger, I didn&#39;t say much about how messy it got.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, now it&#39;s out of control.  There is no path in and out.  He<br/>\nsleeps on the sofa most nights because he can&#39;t see the TV from his<br/>\npreferred sleeping spot, under the bed (he has a daybed that&#39;s<br/>\nsomewhat tall and he is more comfortable making the underneath into a<br/>\ncave of sorts).  He can&#39;t sleep on the bed even if he wanted to<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s covered in toys.  The floor and every surface is covered<br/>\nwith toys.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of it I can see is an active battle ground for action figures and<br/>\nI completely understand that and really wouldn&#39;t mind it if maybe the<br/>\nrest of the room wasn&#39;t such a disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has friends over and they tend to play in the spare bedroom now<br/>\nbecause no one else can really navigate his room.  He wants to have a<br/>\nfriend sleepover this weekend which typically doesn&#39;t bother me at all<br/>\n(we&#39;ve had 3 or 4 friends at a time for 4 days in a row or more),<br/>\nhowever there&#39;s no where for anyone to sleep because of the state of<br/>\nhis room, and it&#39;s also quite dangerous.  I also told him I&#39;d really<br/>\nlike it to be done before Christmas because I don&#39;t want the new toys<br/>\nbroken because stuff is getting stepped on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe told him no one could stay over until the room was picked up,<br/>\nbecause honestly it&#39;s not safe.  We&#39;ve offered to help, we&#39;ve offered<br/>\nto do it for him, we&#39;ve waited over a week for him to do it himself<br/>\n(which he normally does before it gets quite this bad).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also a second problem to this.  We live in an apartment<br/>\ncomplex and when some new neighbors moved in we started seeing bugs,<br/>\nat first just a few, now it&#39;s getting worse.  We&#39;ve sprayed and taken<br/>\nother preventative measures in most of the house, but because of it<br/>\nbeing his space we haven&#39;t gotten into the bedroom.  My partner went<br/>\nin there today with the maintenance man because of a window that&#39;s not<br/>\nworking and she noticed empty soda cans which have been there for at<br/>\nleast two weeks (because we haven&#39;t had cans in the house in that<br/>\nlong), empty candy wrappers, open boxes of cereal and such.  We&#39;ve<br/>\nalways told him he can only take food in there if it and all trash<br/>\ncomes out, but since we haven&#39;t been able to make it in the door in<br/>\nthe last few weeks we didn&#39;t realize it was a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nTypically, about this time of the year we do a huge clean up of his<br/>\nroom and help him reorganize everything so that when the Christmas<br/>\nstuff is brought in there&#39;s a nice clean palate to figure out where to<br/>\nfit the new stuff.  He normally loves that idea because he picks out<br/>\nall of the toys he no longer wants and through craigslist we find a<br/>\nfamily in need and give them enough toys to make a nice Christmas for<br/>\nsomeone.  This year he has absolutely no interest in doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need advice on how to proceed without turning this into something<br/>\nthat damages our relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45614,"nextTopicId":34315}}
