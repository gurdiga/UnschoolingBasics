I sat in the school cafeteria for a <br/>\n&gt; few hours every Wednesday night, frowning at a math book that Mom <br/>\n&gt; had bought for me, slowly working through it but not wanting to go <br/>\n&gt; to the instructor for help.

Why hadn&#39;t Mom stuck to it <br/>\n&gt; and made me learn math?  Of course, I remembered resisting any of <br/>\n&gt; her efforts at instruction.  What was the solution?  I was 17 and <br/>\n&gt; the most advanced math concept I had under my belt was <br/>\n&gt; multiplication.<br/>\n&gt; I cried to my parents that I hated adult education but felt like it <br/>\n&gt; was my only shot at succeeding in life.

With encouragement from my parents, I began applying at a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>few <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; businesses and shortly thereafter became employed at a local video <br/>\n&gt; store.

But an uneasiness that had been lurking <br/>\n&gt; finally surfaced when I was being trained to make the nightly <br/>\n&gt; deposit at the store.  My supervisor, a 30-something woman with a <br/>\n&gt; husband and two children, counted money and stacked checks and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>wrote <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; notes with the expert lightning speed that comes with much <br/>\n&gt; practice.

My uncertainty stemmed from the lack of a sympathetic <br/>\n&gt; community.<br/>\n&gt; The second thing they did wrong was not explaining to me what <br/>\n&gt; unschooling was.  I&#39;ll have to hand this one to Mom, because the <br/>\n&gt; whole alternative education thing was her idea.  As I reached my <br/>\n&gt; teens and became embarrassed of the fact that I didn&#39;t know the <br/>\n&gt; multiplication tables, I took her to task for being lazy and not <br/>\n&gt; making me do schoolwork.  Mom said that she believed that I would <br/>\n&gt; learn what I needed to know when I needed to know it.  She threw me <br/>\n&gt; a couple of concepts from John Holt and A.S. Neill that temporarily <br/>\n&gt; pacified me, but I only understood a few years later when I read <br/>\n&gt; Summerhill for myself.<br/>\n&gt; Back to the first item on the list: lack of community.  I loved and <br/>\n&gt; trusted my mother, but when I started growing out of childhood I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>had <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to seriously reconsider her position, because nobody else in my <br/>\n&gt; world agreed with her.  Even Dad had pleaded with me to try school <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; few times a year since I was 8 or so.  I believe I considered his <br/>\n&gt; suggestion once for about ten minutes.  I certainly didn&#39;t want to <br/>\n&gt; go to school, but everyone (except Mom) was telling me that I was <br/>\n&gt; missing out, that my future was uncertain.

Untouched by the school <br/>\nsystem that shapes other kids&#39; ABCs.&quot; Later, as Mom was searching <br/>\nfor a title for her book, I thought of `unprocessed&#39; again and it <br/>\nseemed to fit. <br/>\n        You&#39;ll become very familiar with me in the following pages. <br/>\nMy real name is Laurie, and I was earmarked to be an unschooler <br/>\nwhile I was a mere gestating fetus, but I didn&#39;t know that I was an <br/>\nunschooler until I was about seventeen.<br/>\n\tI thought I was a homeschooler. When we were out in public <br/>\nand nosy people asked why I wasn&#39;t in school, I would say, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nhomeschooled.&quot; I hated that question nearly as much as I hated the <br/>\nvarying degrees of horror and condemnation that followed. I suppose <br/>\nthat we never said &quot;unschooled&quot; in order to protect ourselves from <br/>\nbeing reported to some governmental agency.<br/>\n        We told lots of white lies. We faked progress reports to <br/>\nLouisiana&#39;s school board so they would leave us alone. When adults <br/>\nasked me what grade I was in, I would try to figure it out. I would <br/>\nthink, okay, first grade is six years old because Aunt Laura teaches <br/>\nfirst grade and her kids are six, so second grade is seven. I&#39;m <br/>\neight, so I&#39;m in third grade.<br/>\n&quot;I guess I&#39;m in third grade,&quot; I&#39;d respond.<br/>\n       Even though Mom told me that it didn&#39;t matter what other <br/>\npeople thought, and that the school board was stupid, I started <br/>\ngetting a little panicky when I was in my mid-teens. I had developed <br/>\na conception of myself as a lazy homeschooler. I asked Mom, <br/>\ntearfully, why she hadn&#39;t made me learn math. She responded that she <br/>\nknew that I would learn it when I needed to and was ready.<br/>\n&quot;How do you know that?&quot; I&#39;d ask. She said it would be just like <br/>\nlearning to read, but I didn&#39;t believe her. I thought of myself as <br/>\nuntested, unproven, in limbo.<br/>\n       Then, when I was seventeen, I read Summerhill and I <br/>\nunderstood. It was amazing. I finally understood why Mom believed <br/>\nwhat she did about the nature of children. I apologized to her for <br/>\nbeing so doubtful about how I was being raised, and asked her why <br/>\nshe hadn&#39;t explained it to me. She thought she had.<br/>\n\tMom&#39;s mistake was only telling me the conclusions she <br/>\nreached after reading Summerhill and various John Holt books. Of <br/>\ncourse she told me that all people learn different things in <br/>\ndifferent ways at different times, but she didn&#39;t share the examples <br/>\nthat led her to believe that. Mom didn&#39;t tell me about the happy, <br/>\nfulfilled man who had gone to Summerhill and was so completely <br/>\ndedicated to being a mechanic that he didn&#39;t really learn to read <br/>\nuntil he wanted to at the age of eighteen.<br/>\n\tHere was a wealth of anecdotes about kids who were allowed <br/>\nto be completely unique, just like me, outside of a mandatory school <br/>\nsystem. And they were just fine. In fact, they were generally <br/>\nhappier and more successful than school kids.<br/>\n\tMore revelations came later, in the spring of 2001 when I <br/>\nedited the first draft of this book and got Mom&#39;s full story. She <br/>\ntold accounts of my childhood that I didn&#39;t remember, and advanced <br/>\ntheories that I hadn&#39;t heard. It made me realize just how radical my <br/>\nupbringing was, and how lucky I was to have experienced it.<br/>\n\tI realize now that my teenage doubts were the same as the <br/>\ndoubts that plague many homeschooling and unschooling parents.

I met several wonderful friends there, one of whom I <br/>\nstarted dating when I was 17.

However, my <br/>\nmath scores were below acceptable levels and I could take adult <br/>\neducation at the high school to bring me up to speed before I retook <br/>\nthe CAT.  <br/>\nSo I tried it, and hated it.  I sat in the school cafeteria for a <br/>\nfew hours every Wednesday night, frowning at a math book that Mom <br/>\nhad bought for me, slowly working through it but not wanting to go <br/>\nto the instructor for help.  Adult education was not a class, but <br/>\nmany people scattered throughout the cafeteria working on their own, <br/>\nwith the option of individual help.  I felt stupid, a new feeling to <br/>\nme.  I should know this stuff already.  Why hadn&#39;t Mom stuck to it <br/>\nand made me learn math?  Of course, I remembered resisting any of <br/>\nher efforts at instruction.  What was the solution?  I was 17 and <br/>\nthe most advanced math concept I had under my belt was <br/>\nmultiplication.<br/>\nI cried to my parents that I hated adult education but felt like it <br/>\nwas my only shot at succeeding in life.  Dad told me that if I hated <br/>\nit so much, I shouldn&#39;t go.  Mom assured me that I would find a <br/>\npassion and a way to achieve it.  I didn&#39;t really believe her, but I <br/>\nhad been raised following my own pleasure so I stopped going to <br/>\nadult education, feeling like a quitter.<br/>\nI was restless and anxious, about to turn 18 with no direction in <br/>\nlife.  With encouragement from my parents, I began applying at a few <br/>\nbusinesses and shortly thereafter became employed at a local video <br/>\nstore.  I loved my new job, and my self-confidence rose as I was <br/>\npraised for doing well.  But an uneasiness that had been lurking <br/>\nfinally surfaced when I was being trained to make the nightly <br/>\ndeposit at the store.  My supervisor, a 30-something woman with a <br/>\nhusband and two children, counted money and stacked checks and wrote <br/>\nnotes with the expert lightning speed that comes with much <br/>\npractice.  I saw my future in her, and knew I wanted more.  But what <br/>\ncould I do?<br/>\nI despaired of my failed attempt at learning enough math to get a <br/>\nGED, and asked Mom to help me find a solution that would get me into <br/>\ncollege.  A friend of mine left a university catalog at my house and <br/>\nI read through it, thinking that the psychology classes sounded <br/>\ncool.  Then, a happy revelation occurred: Someone told Mom that a <br/>\nGED was not required to attend our local university.  All I would <br/>\nhave to do was take the American College Test (ACT) and they would <br/>\nput me in appropriate classes according to my scores.<br/>\nSo I did, and I was accepted to the university.  By virtue of my own <br/>\nguesswork, my math score placed me in a higher math than I could <br/>\nhandle, so I switched classes after the first day.  My college had <br/>\ntwo developmental mathematics courses that corresponded roughly with <br/>\nhigh school algebra one and two, so I ended up in the first one.  I <br/>\nbelieve we started on long division, right where I needed to be.  I <br/>\ngrasped every new concept easily, finishing the course with a 94 <br/>\naverage.  As of now, the highest mathematical science course I have <br/>\ntaken was a senior-level statistics course, a discipline that I <br/>\nimmediately loved.<br/>\nBy the way, did I mention my 4.0 grade point average?<br/>\nSo, I have a success story, with my bachelor of arts in Sociology <br/>\nand my flawless grades.  My first boyfriend and I broke up when our <br/>\nrelationship had run its course after nearly three years of dating.  <br/>\nWe are still friends and I consider our romance a pleasant chapter <br/>\nin my life that I have now closed.  I have had two great jobs since <br/>\nthe video store.  I have many acquaintances and friends, and a small <br/>\ngroup of very close friends that I see several times a week.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have another boyfriend yet, but my standards are high and I&#39;m <br/>\nnot really looking.  My parents are now divorced, but I see both of <br/>\nthem often and maintain close relationships with them.  I am looking <br/>\nforward to graduate school next year.<br/>\nLife has been beautiful, even with all of its flaws, since I entered <br/>\ncollege.  I absolutely cannot imagine myself without college.  The <br/>\nvast amount of knowledge imparted to me, the constant approval, and <br/>\nthe assurance that I was going somewhere fed me, watered me, and put <br/>\nme into the light to grow.<br/>\nBut, I have a question.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that infamous &quot;What if I had gone through K-12?&quot; question.  <br/>\nI have all but decided that I would have been like several of my <br/>\nfriends who got bored with school because they were too smart for <br/>\nit, bucked the system, got in trouble, developed a passionate hate <br/>\nfor authority, and turned to anything illegal for defiance and <br/>\nescape.<br/>\nMy question is, why was I so unhappy and unsure as a teenager?  Why <br/>\ndid math cause me so much grief?  Why didn&#39;t I have any friends <br/>\nuntil I met them on my bulletin board system?<br/>\nI laughed at myself as I reread that last paragraph, thinking I may <br/>\nas well be asking, &quot;Why wasn&#39;t everything perfect?&quot;  I&#39;m considering <br/>\nlaying these questions to rest without trying to answer them.  But I <br/>\nwon&#39;t, because the unschooling skeptics will come after me like an <br/>\nangry lynch mob, justifying their position that my parents failed <br/>\nme, because I had trouble with math before college and was restless <br/>\nand without direction during my 15th and 16th years.<br/>\nAlso, I really must answer these questions for myself.  I still <br/>\nremember me, a tearful girl in her mid-teens, telling Mom <br/>\nthat &quot;Well, you know, if I have kids, I guess I&#39;ll probably send <br/>\nthem to school.&quot;  I have to answer these questions for that <br/>\nuncertain girl.  I have to do penance for myself for losing faith in <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\nSo, I must write down what I believe my parents did wrong.<br/>\nThe first thing that they did wrong was staying in Louisiana when I <br/>\nwas born.  My uncertainty stemmed from the lack of a sympathetic <br/>\ncommunity.<br/>\nThe second thing they did wrong was not explaining to me what <br/>\nunschooling was.  I&#39;ll have to hand this one to Mom, because the <br/>\nwhole alternative education thing was her idea.  As I reached my <br/>\nteens and became embarrassed of the fact that I didn&#39;t know the <br/>\nmultiplication tables, I took her to task for being lazy and not <br/>\nmaking me do schoolwork.  Mom said that she believed that I would <br/>\nlearn what I needed to know when I needed to know it.  She threw me <br/>\na couple of concepts from John Holt and A.S. Neill that temporarily <br/>\npacified me, but I only understood a few years later when I read <br/>\nSummerhill for myself.<br/>\nBack to the first item on the list: lack of community.  I loved and <br/>\ntrusted my mother, but when I started growing out of childhood I had <br/>\nto seriously reconsider her position, because nobody else in my <br/>\nworld agreed with her.  Even Dad had pleaded with me to try school a <br/>\nfew times a year since I was 8 or so.  I believe I considered his <br/>\nsuggestion once for about ten minutes.  I certainly didn&#39;t want to <br/>\ngo to school, but everyone (except Mom) was telling me that I was <br/>\nmissing out, that my future was uncertain.  I was torn; I didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow what to believe.  I thought we were just homeschoolers that <br/>\nwere doing it wrong.<br/>\nI now believe that Mom probably explained her philosophies on <br/>\nunschooling a little better than I remember, but I think I would <br/>\nhave gone through much less stress if we had known just one or two <br/>\nunschooling families to help set my (and Dad&#39;s, for that matter) <br/>\ndoubts to rest.<br/>\nThe lack of friends is part of the lack of community.  I had several <br/>\nfriends until, frankly, they got stupid and annoying.  My number of <br/>\nfriends was already limited because, obviously, I didn&#39;t meet as <br/>\nmany kids just hanging around in my neighborhood as I would have in <br/>\nschool, and most of the time I preferred solitary activities such as <br/>\nreading books or inventing stories with the aid of Barbies and G.I. <br/>\nJoes as actors.  In fact, I don&#39;t ever recall truly wanting peer <br/>\ncompanionship before my mid-teens.  When my age got close to the <br/>\ndouble-digits, my girl friends started acting silly over boys and <br/>\nmessing with makeup and obsessing over designer jeans.  My girl <br/>\nfriends hated reading, except for Tiger Beat and other pin-up <br/>\nmagazines.  Their Barbies only changed clothes and teased hair and <br/>\nkissed Ken.  I could still relate to a few boys I knew, but after a <br/>\nwhile they changed too.<br/>\nI had friends among my cousins and the few kids that Mom babysat, <br/>\nand Mom herself was my best friend and confidant.  I didn&#39;t have <br/>\nfriends as a teen because there weren&#39;t really any left over from <br/>\nchildhood, but I fixed that when I joined the online community.  As <br/>\nfar as I know, I never suffered ill effects because of any of this <br/>\nfriend stuff, so that question is resolved.<br/>\nAs far as math is concerned, I know I would have learned it easily <br/>\nfrom a tutor had I not been able to enroll in college without a high <br/>\nschool equivalent.  The adult education was a mistake: I found it <br/>\nhard to learn from a textbook lying under my nose without any <br/>\noutside instruction.  I could have had help from my parents and from <br/>\nthe adult education instructor, but I didn&#39;t want to ask.  I have <br/>\nalways preferred to figure things out by myself.  I also had math <br/>\nanxiety from many sources.  I knew how to do things like balancing a <br/>\ncheckbook and measuring ingredients, but beyond that I saw no <br/>\npractical application of math in my life.  Yet I had a panicky <br/>\nfeeling that I should be learning it.  One of the most popular <br/>\nquestions asked of homeschoolers (my family included) is, &quot;But what <br/>\nabout math?&quot;<br/>\nI remember saying when I was 16 or 17, &quot;There&#39;s a restriction on my <br/>\ndriver&#39;s license that says I must wear corrective lenses to drive, <br/>\nso why can&#39;t I get a diploma with a restriction that says I must <br/>\nhave a calculator to do math?  Both are devices designed to assist <br/>\nme in doing what I need to do to survive.&quot;  That logic still makes <br/>\nsense to me today, but I have learned something new.  Math is a <br/>\nwonderful science that is evident in some form or another in <br/>\neverything we do.  It&#39;s a tool for survival.  That&#39;s why, in <br/>\ncollege, my favorite problems were the word problems.  It made math <br/>\nseem real and not like jargon-filled number manipulation.  So, what <br/>\nabout math?  I had some anxiety about it, but that was quickly cured <br/>\nwhen I started taking math classes.<br/>\nWow, it looks like I&#39;ve answered all of my questions.  Maybe <br/>\neverything about my upbringing wasn&#39;t perfect, but I will never, <br/>\never complain about the results.  <br/>\n<br/>\nlove, Valerie<br/>\nwww.ubpub.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Explaining Unschooling to Children","postDate":"1091629771","msgId":2494,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1OC4zYjZlMWM2OC4yZTQyNGNjYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2492,"nextInTopic":2549,"prevInTime":2493,"nextInTime":2495,"topicId":2485,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/4/2004 8:42:55 AM Eastern Daylight Time, zoocrew@wideopenwest.com writes: How have  you all explained unschooling during the transition","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1196748342\">In a message dated 8/4/2004 8:42:55 AM Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zoocrew@...\">zoocrew@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow have  you all explained unschooling during the <br/>\ntransition time between structure  and personal control? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nTime is best. &lt;g&gt; I explained and explained---and backtracked a bit  as well. <br/>\nIt took a while to correctly put into practice what I knew to be right!  <br/>\nCameron could feel my instability, I know!

My daughter was almost 6 when we started and I really wanted it to work.  I didn&#39;t want to backslide into telling her what to do and I wanted her to know the power she has in our family and in her own life.  Sometimes I do start to get nervous about where she might be in comparison to other children her age, and I&#39;ll try to get her to break out some certain subject books.  She always gets me back on track with a &quot;do I HAVE to do that?&quot;  I always of course say, &quot;no.&quot;  and she says something very nice and diplomatic like... well, maybe I look at that in a few days after I&#39;m done with this whatever-it-is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe knows that with unschooling she gets to choose what her days will be like, every day, and that she has an equal say in what the family does (in most situations).  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s very into Egypt, and Spies, and Geology, computer games, swimming, fashion, friends, and READING.  She reads constantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway... I think kids knowing that the dreaded curriculum is not going to resurface helps them.  I think talking about unschooling helps them, and hanging out with other unschooling kids helps them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in the Austin area of Texas and I have two groups with a total of about 75 unschooling families.. then I have another group in Plano with about 33 families in it.  The value of other unschooling families can&#39;t be overstated.  If there are no unschooling families in your area, you might want to make it a point to get to at least one unschooling conference every year.  The conferences are wonderful opportunities for children.<br/>\n<br/>\nReassuring your son he won&#39;t have to return to the drudgery of sitting at a table or desk will benefit him, and benefit your relationship.  From here on out, it&#39;s so much about getting close to your child and really discovering who he is, while he discovers who you are.  Trust is really built in the first few years of unschooling.  If you have to reassure him that unschooling is here to stay every day for months on end... do so.  It won&#39;t hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nNichole<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Tina <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, August 04, 2004 7:41 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Explaining Unschooling to Children<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve been wondering about this for a while.
