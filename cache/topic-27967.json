Eastern Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do  you implement those principles?<br/>\n<br/>\nI still struggle with my boys punching  each other :( I say, &quot;don&#39;t hit, <br/>\nuse your words!&quot; and they still whack  each other.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nPersonally I believe that I can&#39;t decide what principles another person  is <br/>\ngoing to live by.  I have to decide for myself what is important and  live by <br/>\nthat.  Be the best example I can be, and just be there for my boys  to ask <br/>\nquestions of, ponder things over with etc.  But I can&#39;t make someone  else live by <br/>\nthe principles I believe are important to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAs far as the hitting, we had some of that with my  youngest, when he was <br/>\nyounger.  LOL.  Does that make sense.  And  I never told him he couldn&#39;t hit.  I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t tell him that &quot;we don&#39;t hit&quot;  &quot;hitting isn&#39;t nice&quot; or any of those <br/>\nthings.  And I think that stepping in  and saying &quot;use your words&quot; is a very good <br/>\nplace to start. But I wouldn&#39;t leave  it at that.  Hitting was a tool my son <br/>\nwas using to get his needs  met.  I was there with the boys to try to step in <br/>\nwhen things were  escalating, helping both of them to verbalize how they are <br/>\nfeeling, validating  those feelings, helping them to verbalize what it is that <br/>\nthey need or want in  the moment.  When both boys were feeling heard and <br/>\nunderstood they could  then move toward problem solving to find a solution that was <br/>\nagreeable to both  of them.  Helping them discover that there are &quot;other&quot; tool<br/>\ns out there for  problem solving is a great gift.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt was very key for me to be there, and to help.   Now they are very good at <br/>\nworking this process for themselves.  Although  they know I am always there to <br/>\nhelp, and now will come get me when they need a  fresh set of &quot;ears&quot; and <br/>\nideas.  And they both know that the solution that  is right for the situation is <br/>\nout there if they work hard enough to find it, so  they are willing to work at <br/>\nit.  Over time the process takes less and  less energy but in just starting <br/>\nout it does take energy and time, but time  well spent.  <br/>\n <br/>\nJust a couple thoughts,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPam  G<br/>\n<br/>\nOur Blogs:<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/_\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/)\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/_\">http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/)\">http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************Check out AOL&#39;s list of 2007&#39;s hottest <br/>\nproducts.<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)\">http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":228,"nextTopicId":27976}}
