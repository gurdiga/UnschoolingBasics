If the goal of the parent-child relationship is that<br/>\nrelationship and not pushing some other agenda, like the parent&#39;s <br/>\ncareer or<br/>\nthe child&#39;s ability to get into Yale or that moment when some parent <br/>\nsays<br/>\n&quot;You do it because I said so.&quot; when their kid asks why, then the period <br/>\nof<br/>\ngrowing from child to adult should not be fraught with tension and <br/>\nfights.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll go even further.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* think that the rebellion comes in because the child (teen) is doing <br/>\nEXACTLY what the parent has been pushing the child to do all along: Be <br/>\nindependent! Be curious! Go explore! Make your own decisions!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then, when the child DOES go out experimenting, the parent wants <br/>\nthat control BACK.<br/>\n<br/>\nMom & Dad can&#39;t have it BOTH ways. It&#39;s unfair to the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe child is SUPPOSED to leave home. He&#39;s expected to make <br/>\nmistakes---that&#39;s a HUGE part of learning. Trying. Experimenting. <br/>\nStopping. Starting. Doing. Believing. Changing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut weirdly, parents want their kids &quot;perfect&quot; (according to the <br/>\nparents) before they step out into the &quot;real world.&quot; That&#39;s not <br/>\npossible. Of course, I think unschooling children have a distinct <br/>\nadvantage here, because they are already OUT in the real world, but <br/>\nkids who&#39;ve had NO autonomy and who have NO experience making small <br/>\ndecisions/choices really have no legs to stand on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHAH! Like my last post! No *FOUNDATION* &lt;g&gt; to build on. We can use <br/>\nthat blow-up mattress thing here too! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren who have been told how and when and with whom to do things <br/>\nreally have nothing to base future decisions on. They&#39;re missing the <br/>\nWHY.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think sometimes the *why* can be explained---not often though. To me <br/>\n*why* MUST be internal. There has to be a point ---a connection---or <br/>\nbetter, a SERIES of connections for an individual to make sense of <br/>\n*why*.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, that&#39;s where the Rules vs. Principles thang comes in. Saying, <br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t hit&quot; may get the person not to hit again right now. But knowing <br/>\n*WHY* (which must be internalized) hurting others is unkind (or when it <br/>\nIS appropriate) makes a huge difference in being able to function vs <br/>\nfollowing orders.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the parent allows the child to be exactly who he is at this <br/>\nmoment---and accept him and trust and respect him, there&#39;s no need to <br/>\nfight ---well, what IS there to fight about???<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-==-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe this with two children who haven&#39;t reached their teens yet. <br/>\nSo I am<br/>\nnot speaking from experience.

You can&#39;t<br/>\nexpect a young child to NOT be  fascinated with a hiding place, nor<br/>\nshould a parent expect to be able  to focus on shopping while a young<br/>\nchild is with  them.<br/>\nI&#39;m a single mom. I support myself and three children  and somehow manage to <br/>\nhome educate as well. Sometimes there is time  for play at a store. We&#39;ve done <br/>\nthat a good bit. Sometimes there  isn&#39;t because I have to be at a gig and <br/>\nwork so that we  have food on our table. I&#39;ve been on my own since my youngest <br/>\nwas a  baby. When I&#39;m at a store (which isn&#39;t often) I need to shop and focus on <br/>\n shopping and not loose my child to a child abductor. I did what  I needed to <br/>\ndo to protect my daughter. Also, I respect store  merchandise and do not feel <br/>\nthat people want children playing inside of  clothing racks with sticky <br/>\nfingers from having just eaten a PB&J  sandwich or whatever. I don&#39;t want someone&#39;s <br/>\nkid all over my  microphones, instruments and music equipment when I&#39;m at <br/>\nwork  and I don&#39;t want to be the kind of parent that allows that when we  are <br/>\nsomewhere in public. <br/>\nIf we consider the needs of the child first and  foremost, then it ends<br/>\nmost of the reasons for meltdowns. <br/>\nHer most basic needs are to eat and have a roof over her  head. As her <br/>\nprovider I had to quickly get done with the shopping  and then go to work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have an extremely<br/>\nintense/sensitive child and in trying to  consider his needs and<br/>\ndesires I feel that we&#39;ve saved a ton of  wasted negative energy!<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren like to hide. Find a way for  them to do it rather than<br/>\nconstantly stopping them. If they are  knocking things off the racks or<br/>\ncausing problems then it&#39;s time to  leave the store and find a park<br/>\nwhere they can safely play.  <br/>\nLOL! That would be nice if we all had lives where  we could make a departure <br/>\nto a park every time our child needs a park.  Maybe if I won the lottery or <br/>\nsomething! There are times you need to  be in a store and your child has to <br/>\nbehave themselves! Luckily I have only  had a problem with that sort of thing less <br/>\nthan a handful of times because  my children and I are very close and they <br/>\nunderstand when its  time to help so that we, as a family, can accomplish our <br/>\ngoal. I must  also say that even my friends who are stay at home moms, or aren&#39;t <br/>\nwidowed  or divorced and have plenty of support and family around them do NOT <br/>\n always have the luxury of taking off for the park when their child is  <br/>\nfeeling playful. <br/>\n<br/>\nExpectations that are unrealistic (pulling<br/>\na child out of a  rack and expecting them to understand why) leads to<br/>\nproblems.  Mimicking a child that is frustrated is  disrespectful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel that doing something that ended in both of  us being in stitches <br/>\nfrom laughter was disrespectful. I had to get my  shopping done and leave. I <br/>\ncould have chosen <br/>\n1. to do what I did (which solved the problem, and again  ended in laughter <br/>\nand hugs)<br/>\n2. To leave her in the rack (dangerous for her,  and disrespectful to the <br/>\nstore owners)  <br/>\n3. to strap her into a stroller (not cool at all with  me)<br/>\n4. to hold her against her will (again, not the way I  like to treat her)<br/>\n <br/>\nA park day wasn&#39;t possible.

My son at age 10 decided to rebel<br/>\nagainst <br/>\nthings that are part of ME - like the kind of job I support my family with<br/>\n(I <br/>\nwork as the music director at a Catholic Church and sing at Jazz gigs at <br/>\nnight) It bothered him all of the sudden that people might think he could<br/>\nfollow <br/>\nin my footsteps (since he is really musical) So, he decided to act out and <br/>\nspeak in a way that would ensure that I (and others) NEVER in a million<br/>\nyears <br/>\nwould think he will &#39;choose to be like me when he grows up.&#39; He tried to do <br/>\neverything that is as &quot;uncatholic&quot; as can be and also tried to distance <br/>\nhimself from music in every way he could, including saying that he hated all<br/>\n<br/>\ninstruments, didn&#39;t want to sing, blah blah. It lasted about 6 or 7 months<br/>\nand <br/>\nthough he still talks the talk, he now isn&#39;t walking the walk and sits at<br/>\nthe <br/>\npiano and plays, gets out his trumpet, prays at night, sings all the time<br/>\nwhile <br/>\nhe is walking around the house, and talks about being thankful to God. I <br/>\nhave to be very careful/respectful and never say &quot;that was a nice song you<br/>\nwere <br/>\nhumming&quot; or &quot;it was sweet that you asked God to make your brother feel <br/>\nbetter.&quot; If I wasn&#39;t aware of his rebellion, I couldn&#39;t be sensitive enough<br/>\nto <br/>\npretend I don&#39;t notice these wonderful things in him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I totally disagree with getting down on the floor and acting like<br/>\nthe child when they&#39;re having a meltdown or other difficulty. That&#39;s<br/>\nthe last thing a person needs during a frustrating moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw the lesson as life-saving. My daughter was trying to see what she <br/>\ncould do to get me to change my mind and be ok with her hiding inside the<br/>\nmiddle <br/>\nof clothing racks where she could get lost and abducted. I kept pulling her <br/>\nout, she kept going in. It wasn&#39;t a game I was ok with because I know of <br/>\nsomeone who lost (permanently) their child this way at Sears in CA. Not<br/>\ntaking her <br/>\nto the store was not an option. I was on my own. Our mirrored antics and <br/>\ntantrums helped her to laugh at the situation. At 2 she had that great of a <br/>\nsense of humor and could see the silliness involved. Since she&#39;s my child, I<br/>\n<br/>\nknow what works with her and understand how sophisticated she has always<br/>\nbeen <br/>\nwhen it comes to being able to laugh at herself and whatever situation is<br/>\ngoing <br/>\non.

My kids have  nothing<br/>\nto rebel against so why would that be a natural  stage?<br/>\nI think it is natural for some, maybe not for others,  but one certainly does <br/>\nhear about it, especially during times when  children are trying to make a <br/>\nstatement about who they are/aren&#39;t. My son  at age 10 decided to rebel against <br/>\nthings that are part of  ME - like the kind of job I support my family with (I <br/>\nwork as the  music director at a Catholic Church and sing at Jazz gigs at <br/>\nnight) It  bothered him all of the sudden that people might think he could follow <br/>\nin  my footsteps (since he is really musical) So, he decided to act out and  <br/>\nspeak in a way that would ensure that I (and others) NEVER in a  million years <br/>\nwould think he will &#39;choose to be like me  when he grows up.&#39; He tried to do <br/>\neverything that is as &quot;uncatholic&quot; as  can be and also tried to distance <br/>\nhimself from music in every way he  could, including saying that he hated all <br/>\ninstruments, didn&#39;t want to  sing, blah blah. It lasted about 6 or 7 months and <br/>\nthough he still  talks the talk, he now isn&#39;t walking the walk and sits at the <br/>\npiano and  plays, gets out his trumpet, prays at night, sings all the time while <br/>\nhe  is walking around the house, and talks about being thankful to God. I <br/>\nhave  to be very careful/respectful and never say &quot;that was a nice song you  were <br/>\nhumming&quot; or &quot;it was sweet that you asked God to make your brother  feel <br/>\nbetter.&quot; If I wasn&#39;t aware of his rebellion, I couldn&#39;t be sensitive  enough to <br/>\npretend I don&#39;t notice these wonderful things in  him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I totally disagree with getting down on the  floor and acting like<br/>\nthe child when they&#39;re having a meltdown or other  difficulty. That&#39;s<br/>\nthe last thing a person needs during a frustrating  moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nI saw the lesson as life-saving. My daughter was trying  to see what she <br/>\ncould do to get me to change my mind and be ok with  her hiding inside the middle <br/>\nof clothing racks where she could  get lost and abducted. I kept pulling her <br/>\nout, she kept going in. It  wasn&#39;t a game I was ok with because I know of <br/>\nsomeone who lost  (permanently) their child this way at Sears in CA. Not taking her <br/>\nto the  store was not an option. I was on my own. Our mirrored antics and  <br/>\ntantrums helped her to laugh at the situation. At 2 she had  that great of a <br/>\nsense of humor and could see the silliness involved.  Since she&#39;s my child, I <br/>\nknow what works with her and understand how  sophisticated she has always been <br/>\nwhen it comes to being able to  laugh at herself and whatever situation is going <br/>\non. We use humor and self  reflection a lot as methods of learning and <br/>\nrefining  ourselves.<br/>\n <br/>\nAdriana      <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] respecting grandma WAS Patriot Ledge article","postDate":"1165770338","msgId":19611,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyMDUwNS4yODc2Mi5xbUB3ZWI1MzgwNi5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjEyMTAwODMycjc3Y2NiODk5eTkyOGYwYmM3ZmU4OWNiNGNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":19609,"nextInTopic":19616,"prevInTime":19610,"nextInTime":19612,"topicId":19585,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve not dealt with the rebelling issue.

I have a feeling, though,that my mother is going to deal with that this week. Dan and I are flying up to Portland, OR on Thursday and the kids are all staying with my mom. She has lots of rules: places and times for eating,times for going to bed, limited electronic use (tv, computer, cell phone), going to church (why she is insisting on taking 3 agnostic or Pagan children to a Christian church is beyond me!). I&#39;m sure when we get back that my mom is going to have a long list of &quot;rebel issues&quot; that I never see. We&#39;ve assured the kids that we are just a cellphone call away and we will intervene on their behalf. We&#39;ve raised our children with respect and we get that respect back.

Is there not someone better suited to taking care of your kids for a week?  Not some way to take them along, or skip the trip?  A week with that Grandma would be hellish for my unschooling kids.  Andy did three solo visits with the grandparents, who are much like you describe your Mom -- he doesn&#39;t rebel, but goes with the flow out of respect that he is a guest in their home (I expect no less from our boys), but has decided the stress is just too much for him and he won&#39;t be visiting alone anymore.  Dan never has had any willingness to be alone with them in their home.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I think it&#39;s unreasonable for you to have your Mom keep your kids and encourage them to flout her rules, no matter how unreasonable you think the rules are. It is her home, and by having your kids there, she&#39;s doing you a favor.  The least you can all do is make the visit as pleasant as possible for everyone.  I think you&#39;re setting everyone for unnecessary hurt feelings.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  We&#39;ve raised our children with respect and we get that respect back. Not because we &quot;deserve&quot; or &quot;expect&quot; it but because we show it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  Yet you&#39;re telling them they don&#39;t have to show Grandma any respect, that it&#39;s okay to disrespect her because you don&#39;t agree with her.   What you&#39;ll be showing them is that you don&#39;t have any respect for Grandma either.

I  did this with my toddler <br/>\nwho was SCREAMING and flailing on the floor  at Target years ago and I got down <br/>\non the floor and did exactly what  she was doing, and it solved the problem <br/>\nvery quickly. <br/>\n4. Lastly, I know this is going to SHOCK you because it  shocked the heck out <br/>\nof me when it happened at our house, but nine is  basically a &quot;pre-teen&quot; and <br/>\nhe&#39;s starting all that rebellious bs! Can  you believe it? So some of it just <br/>\nhas to be ignored and seen as a  stage. The good news is that the earlier they <br/>\nrebel, the sooner they  mature and start acting very responsibly so that <br/>\nprobably means your son  is super gifted. <br/>\n <br/>\nGood luck.
