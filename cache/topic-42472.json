My husband and I entered into a relationship with full consent. We are<br/>\nboth reasonable capable adults with many years of experience between us.<br/>\nMy children are guests that I invited first into my womb and then into my<br/>\nhome, thus making it OUR home. It becoming OUR home didn&#39;t also make it<br/>\ntheir responsibility. They are still guests, not house mates.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I feel disappointed when the people I live with don&#39;t care about my<br/>\nfeelings and needs as they would feel if I did the same.&quot;<br/>\nI find this really isn&#39;t a helpful perspective to have with children. I<br/>\nthink it is really unfair and not age appropriate to equate<br/>\ncleaning/cleanliness with respect. My children do not always clean up after<br/>\nthemselves. And sometimes *I* feel like they don&#39;t love/appreciate/respect<br/>\nme because of their neglecting something that is important to me. That<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make it truth. My kids love me. They love me when thy leave<br/>\ntheir towels on the floor. The still respect me even when they leave the<br/>\ndoors open. They still appreciate the cleaning that I GIFT them even when<br/>\nthey leave their toys/books/etc all over the common area. Their actions, or<br/>\nrather inactions, don&#39;t reflect their feelings, only their lack of<br/>\nexperience or consideration (not towards me but towards cleanliness).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I find that giving 150% in doing things I may not want to for my spouse,<br/>\nbut do, because I care about him, helps our relationship, as he does for<br/>\nme. &quot;<br/>\nYou are making a choice to do those things, to give those gifts. I feel like<br/>\nif I am doing something I otherwise wouldn&#39;t do or don&#39;t care to do, once I<br/>\nmake a conscious effort to chose to do it, it is NO longer something that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to do. I have switched my perspective to serving myself to<br/>\nserving (gifting) another person. I do that because I love my husband and<br/>\nchildren. I don&#39;t do it because I expect anything back from them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Dec 18, 2009 at 4:16 PM, Professional Parenting &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jarnall@...\">jarnall@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Sylvia:<br/>\n&gt; Expectations are communicated in terms of I statements.
