We <br/>\nhad a placement of a little girl who had many problems we eventually realized <br/>\n we were unable to be the best parents for, and we had to disrupt. She is now <br/>\n placed with a family and it seems to be going well.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe just had a match made. We were scared at first on many levels, including  <br/>\nthat they are much younger than we had anticipated, and that there are two! <br/>\nThey  are almost 3 1/2 and 15 months old, two little girls. They are amazing --  <br/>\nbeautiful, sweet. We actually expected them to be moving in Monday -- faster  <br/>\nthan we were ready for, but still...  Then we hit a glitch. We have a  tenant <br/>\nwhose background check elicited some concern (apparently some bar fights  7 <br/>\nor 8 years ago), and the transition and our visits are on hold. We have given  <br/>\nthe tenant notice to move (she feels awful, and she&#39;s very nice.)  We will  <br/>\nfind out hopefully Monday that DSS is willing to let the tenant move and wait  <br/>\nfor up to 30 days to let the girls move in. We&#39;re also hoping they&#39;ll be <br/>\nwilling  to let us visit with the girls away from the house in the meantime.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, please send us energy that our tenant will find a wonderful place,  soon, <br/>\nthat she can afford; that DSS will still allow us to take these amazing  <br/>\nlittle girls, and finally, that we will stay sane in doing this thing that may  be <br/>\na bit crazy when we are old and already have an 18 year old, but feels very  <br/>\nright. It&#39;s been a LONG time since we&#39;ve had wee ones.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, yeah -- this is one of the reasons the conference info isn&#39;t ready yet.  <br/>\nSadly, the delay in placement means it&#39;ll be up this week.
