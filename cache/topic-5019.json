My kids are all over the age of 5 - the youngest two are 6 but they don&#39;t eat meals as such. They prefer to graze when they are hungry on food of their choice. This - strangely enough -is not usually junk food or rubbish but usually their choices are for fruit, cereal, maybe crisps now and then or sandwiches. The older kids like meals but never like the same food as each other.  I do one meal that most like and plate if off so they can have it when they are ready to eat and the ones who don&#39;t want it make themselves something else.  Every Sunday we have a meal together which they like.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh doesn&#39;t watch T.V during the day. He is busy working on our house so only watches it at night. The two youngest put Nick Junior on for a couple of hours from say 6 am - til  8 and then turn it off. They play games, play with they toys, read books with me if they want and watch dv.d&#39;s, draw, paint, go on the computer or go out on the trampoline in our garden. Some days we go out to places. Some days we have friends in.  It depends.  The older ones do similar stuff except the don&#39;t watch T.V during the day unless it is something they specifically want to see.  That was not a rule made by me or dh. Just how they do it.  The older ones have ongoing projects they picked they do when they want to do them and they see friends, go on the computer and go places as well. They eat when they are hungry and get snacks when they like. I don&#39;t bother if they can&#39;t eat a main meal cos I  would leave it in the fridge and someone will always have it. I if they don&#39;t eat it. I don&#39;t  mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe older ones have the T.V in the front room every night but prefer to go up about 8.30 to do stuff in their rooms.( what that stuff is I have no idea!!!) They go to sleep about 11 ish.The 6 year olds are not sleepers. They sleep for about 3 hours and play all night from 11 pm until about 4 when they go to sleep while 6 ish..  It works well.  It is not chaos even tho there are 7 children basically to all appearances doing what they like. At the moment I am typing and it is quiet. All I can hear is the twins playing a game.

Or do you mean you rock her and nurse her and when she falls<br/>\nasleep you put her down?  Or do you mean something else.  I think it<br/>\nwould help us to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan really liked to nurse in mid afternoon when he was tired. <br/>\nSometimes he would doze a little, while I held him.  But he&#39;d be<br/>\nenergized again in a few minutes and on the go.  It was the times he fell<br/>\nasleep and really napped that he was the most cranky.   <br/>\nWe used to joke that we had banned naps at our house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I think Dylan really needed and it proved to be true, was some close<br/>\ncontact and some nutrition.  Maybe your daughter really benefits from a<br/>\nnap but maybe she&#39;d benefit just as much from forty minutes of snuggling<br/>\nand some nursing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe, if nap time is a fight, the benefits of napping in the end<br/>\nwon&#39;t outweigh the detriments of fighting with mom. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I am not yet unschooling and Moira is in kindergarten,***<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s important. This is an unschooling list.  What you&#39;re writing<br/>\nmay speak to some people, but it&#39;s not unschooling advice.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I feel strongly that family meals are an<br/>\nimportant opportunity for parents to model good manners and for everyone<br/>\nin<br/>\nthe family to connect and socialize, so eating meals together is a must<br/>\nfor<br/>\nme. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you ever struggled to get your kids to the table or fought with them<br/>\nabout what or how much they&#39;re eating?  If so, do you consider that<br/>\nmodeling good manners?   I think good manners is trusting a person, even<br/>\na little one, to know if they&#39;re hungry and to know if they want to join<br/>\nthe rest of the family at the dinner table.  It think honoring their<br/>\nfeelings models respect and kindness.   Maybe your kids love family<br/>\ndinner time as much as you and you&#39;ve never had to push to get them to<br/>\nparticipate. <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan is home with me all day so we&#39;ve never been disconnected.  His dad<br/>\nworks but sometimes comes home later than Dylan likes to eat so they<br/>\ndon&#39;t always eat together.  I don&#39;t think it would help Dylan&#39;s<br/>\nrelationship with his dad if I made him wait and eat with David.  It<br/>\ndon&#39;t think their socializing would be as pleasant if Dylan had been<br/>\nhungry for an hour but was made to wait to eat with his dad.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink I&#39;d be modeling good manners to make him wait.     But really,<br/>\nsince Dylan isn&#39;t in school, we don&#39;t have the pressing need to schedule<br/>\ntime with him.  He&#39;s right here.  He&#39;s here all day.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***Snacks are far more casual and can be eaten within a broad timeframe<br/>\n(not within an hour of dinner so that they don&#39;t take one bite and say<br/>\nthey<br/>\nare full),***<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the idea of dinner is to ensure a body eats, then I don&#39;t understand<br/>\nthe concern about a body getting full before dinner.  Food is food at<br/>\nfour in the afternoon and it&#39;s food at five.  Children don&#39;t get sick<br/>\nfrom eating an apple five minutes before dinner and then skipping dinner.<br/>\n Sometimes an apple is all a body needs.  A child won&#39;t forever want to<br/>\neat apples instead of dinner. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I do regulate what they can eat because I feel strongly about<br/>\ngood nutrition and if left on their own, they will see nothing wrong with<br/>\neating junk food all day.***<br/>\n<br/>\nFiltering through my own experience with my kid, who&#39;s never been to<br/>\nschool and who will be thirteen in May:  I&#39;ve never regulated what he<br/>\neats and he&#39;s never eaten junk food all day long.   He likes to feel good<br/>\nand he knows he feels best when he has plenty of water, some protein,<br/>\nsome veggies and fruit.   Yes, he likes chips and Coke and popcorn, but<br/>\nhe&#39;s never only eaten those things and I&#39;ve never told him he couldn&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the reason he has never eaten so called &quot;junk&quot; food all day is<br/>\nbecause I never told him some food was junk and should be consumed<br/>\nsparingly.  Chips aren&#39;t more exciting than oranges, they&#39;re just one<br/>\nmore choice in a house full of choices. <br/>\n<br/>\n***Lauren will sometimes watch TV for a while,<br/>\nthen get up and shut it off and go do something else, usually playing<br/>\nwith<br/>\nher sister Rowan (12 mo).  The first time I saw that I was shocked.  I<br/>\nhad<br/>\nnever seen a child voluntarily shut off the TV.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you might be pleasantly surprised to learn that just like a child<br/>\nfree to watch TV will know when she doesn&#39;t want to watch, a child free<br/>\nto eat when and what she wants will also choose to not eat junk food all<br/>\nday.  A child free to sleep when she wants will sleep when she&#39;s tired.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I have found on unschooling, but the protector part seems to be<br/>\noverlooked, at least in what I have found.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list has 455 members unschooling or learning about unschooling live<br/>\nchildren.  I don&#39;t think they are careless about protecting their kids. <br/>\nWhat I think is they are realistic about what real danger is.  Danger is<br/>\nnot a graham cracker an hour before dinner.  Danger is not an extra hour<br/>\nof TV.  Danger is not a missed nap. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is very well and he was never made to nap, never made to eat<br/>\ndinner with the family, never made to turn off the TV.  Yet he sleeps<br/>\nwhen he&#39;s tired, eats when he&#39;s hungry, watches only as much TV as he<br/>\nwants.  He was never run over by stampeding buffalo or eaten by wolves. <br/>\nHe did smack his head on the coffee table and need stitches when he was<br/>\nabout four but that&#39;s been his only serious injury.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I need to protect my children from making foolish decisions that will<br/>\ncause<br/>\nthemselves pain or harm, and so I step in and give them the benefit of my<br/>\nexperience and wisdom.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find unschoolers on this list advising parents to<br/>\nleave their children to their own devises.  We share our experiences with<br/>\nour kids all day long, every day.  But my need to protect Dylan may not<br/>\nserve Dylan&#39;s need to be his own person, to learn about the world his own<br/>\nway and to live his own life.  I would absolutely stop him if he said he<br/>\nwas going to throw himself under a train, but incredibly he&#39;s never<br/>\nwanted to. ; )  He wants to be ok.  He wants to feel good, be healthy,<br/>\nhave a good life and so his life is less about &quot;my need&quot; to protect him<br/>\nand more about his own self awareness and understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n***At such a young age, my children don&#39;t have the experience or<br/>\nknowledge to make decisions about what<br/>\nkinds of food to eat.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you mean they don&#39;t have the knowledge or experience to make the<br/>\nchoices you&#39;ll approve of.  I bet they can and do make decisions about<br/>\nwhat kinds of food to eat.  I bet if you offered your kids apple slices<br/>\nand cheese and grapes and broccoli and salad dressing for dipping and<br/>\nsome chips they&#39;d eat just what they liked from what you offered and they<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t go out in the driveway and eat spiders and grasshoppers. <br/>\n<br/>\n***than it is to relate the fact that you don&#39;t have the flu that<br/>\nis going around to the fact that you take cod liver oil every day. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t get the flu and I&#39;ve never even considered taking cod liver oil.<br/>\n How do you account for those people who don&#39;t catch flu and who don&#39;t<br/>\ntake cod liver oil?   I eat chocolate almost everyday.  Maybe that&#39;s why<br/>\nI didn&#39;t catch the flu. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n***Lauren still doesn&#39;t really grasp the idea that she gets cranky by 5<br/>\nor 6 pm<br/>\nbecause she didn&#39;t take a nap.***<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s very young.  She didn&#39;t learn to walk right away either, she didn&#39;t<br/>\nlearn how to blow her nose right away, or how to take off some clothes<br/>\nwhen she got too hot.  Learning our body  signals is a very personal<br/>\nthing.  Some adults still don&#39;t understand when they&#39;re over stressed,<br/>\netc.  Because a child hasn&#39;t learned she feels better with more sleep<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean she&#39;ll never learn it and it doesn&#39;t mean she needs to be<br/>\nmade to do so according to someone else&#39;s schedule.  You wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\ninsisted she walk at two months and you wouldn&#39;t have insisted she dress<br/>\nherself at six months.  Insisting she sleeps when you decide she&#39;s tired<br/>\nwon&#39;t help her come to her own conclusions about how much sleep she needs<br/>\nand when.   Helping her find peaceful sleep when you notice she&#39;s tired<br/>\nis a kindness though, and will go along way to helping her understand her<br/>\nbody&#39;s signals.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***Then she has temper tantrums and misbehaves<br/>\nand gets yelled at for it and everyone is miserable. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nIs yelling &quot;behaving?&quot;  Do you think you&#39;re misbehaving when you yell at<br/>\na two year old?  You&#39;re trying to get a two year old to sleep to avoid<br/>\ncrankiness by being cranky yourself?  I think you may not be modeling<br/>\nwhat you wish you were modeling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***She doesn&#39;t like getting yelled at, we don&#39;t like yelling, and it all<br/>\ncould have been<br/>\nprevented with a simple nap.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could have been prevented by kind understanding and choosing not to<br/>\nyelling.  If a person doesn&#39;t like yelling they never have to yell.  <br/>\nWhen your spouse is tired and cranky do you yell at him?  Would you yell<br/>\nat a guest who was tired and cranky?  She doesn&#39;t get yelled at because<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t take a nap, she gets yelled at because *you* yell.  She gets<br/>\ntired when she doesn&#39;t take a nap, she gets cranky, maybe she gets<br/>\noverwhelmed easily.  Those things are a natural consequence of being<br/>\novertired.  Getting yelled at is not.  Yelling is caused every single<br/>\ntime by the yeller.   Loving kindness and understanding, holding and<br/>\nrocking can help a tired child to sleep.  It can help her trust you, can<br/>\nhelp her love you, can help her feel better about falling asleep, can<br/>\nhelp her learn about kindness.  The benefits are endless.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141959941,"authorName":"Judy Anderson","from":"&quot;Judy Anderson&quot; &lt;temair@...&gt;","profile":"kblackclaw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Intro and structure","postDate":"1110866661","msgId":5052,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE1HRUxKTUNKRkhQTUZDQU5HSU9LRUVNT0RQQUEudGVtYWlyQGFkZWxwaGlhLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE3ZmUyZmM0NGRhY2UyNWQ2MTdhOWJiNTAwOTI2NDRlQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":5047,"nextInTopic":5055,"prevInTime":5051,"nextInTime":5053,"topicId":5019,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m not sure what to envision.

I hear tons of what is<br/>\n*not* done, but little of what *is* done.  I know that I can&#39;t be doing too<br/>\nmuch wrong because everyone tells me what wonderful, happy children I have.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you help your children recognize when they need sleep?  From birth<br/>\nmine have all refused to acknowledge that they are tired even as their eyes<br/>\ndroop and their heads fall.  As babies, I lay them down for naps when they<br/>\nstart getting cranky or rubbing their eyes a lot.  It doesn&#39;t matter what<br/>\ntime it is.  As they get older and one nap is enough for them but none is<br/>\ntoo little, I set a time for them because they haven&#39;t shown me that they<br/>\nwill sleep for themselves.  Sometimes Lauren does come to me and ask me for<br/>\na nap.  She has probably done that twice ever and she will be 3 in April.<br/>\nMoira routinely stayed up until 1 am as a baby with no bedtime until I<br/>\nstarted putting her to bed earlier so I could go to bed earlier and get the<br/>\nsleep that I needed to make it through the day without falling asleep at<br/>\nwork (which I often did because I was so tired staying up with her).  I<br/>\nunderstand that everyone thrives on a different schedule, but sometimes it<br/>\nis impossible to accommodate a particular schedule.  Even with not going to<br/>\nschool or if you own your own business, there are still other outside forces<br/>\nthat influence one&#39;s schedule.  I would like to know how others work around<br/>\nthe schedules imposed on us by society and nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudy<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Pam Sorooshian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, March 15, 2005 12:00 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Intro and structure<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   On Mar 14, 2005, at 7:22 PM, Judy Anderson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Lauren<br/>\n  &gt; still doesn&#39;t really grasp the idea that she gets cranky by 5 or 6 pm<br/>\n  &gt; because she didn&#39;t take a nap.

However, I have <br/>\nfigured out when he is tired and that is his &quot;bedtime&quot; and it is <br/>\nflexible depending on many factors.  We all eat breakfast at <br/>\ndifferent times.  We usually all eat lunch at different times.  <br/>\nDinner is fixed at generally the same time each day, but that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean we are all eating it at the same time.  About the only <br/>\ntime that really happens is if we go out for a meal (which is fairly <br/>\nrare).  There always seems to be someone cooking in my kitchen.  And <br/>\nI&#39;ve found ways to allow even Keon to be able to prepare food for <br/>\nhimself (he can make ramen and mac&#39;n cheese and popcorn and heat <br/>\nsoup all in the microwave).  And sometimes I feel like I am in the <br/>\nkitchen all day cooking (which is really fine with me because I <br/>\nenjoy cooking!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor fun once I actually wrote when my kids did things.  When they <br/>\nrose, when they slept, when they ate, and they all had fairly <br/>\npredictible patterns, but they were each unique to each child.

Just to clarify my question further (and most people *were*<br/>\nanswering it) I find I am less curious to know what &quot;structure&quot; looked like<br/>\nin anyone&#39;s home; I am more curious to learn how the children are<br/>\n*communicating* their need/desire for structure - how the children define<br/>\nstructure rather than the parents (I have plenty of residual school-think in<br/>\nmy definition of what structure might look like). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo to paraphrase the replies, please correct me if I am wrong:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to be a combination of the individual children *asking questions*<br/>\nabout the immediate upcoming day(s) and joining in the planning - wanting to<br/>\neither be informed and/or make notes somehow of the planned and expected<br/>\nactivities, to the point where in some cases surprises and changes are<br/>\nviewed negatively - and *behavioral cues* observed over time by the parents<br/>\nsuch as needing extra time to transition from one activity to another, and<br/>\nbecoming distressed in varying degrees by spontaneous changes to the plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not necessarily an overarching schedule that requires absolute routine<br/>\nand sameness every day - I mean the kids generally aren&#39;t requesting this.<br/>\nThe room for extemporaneous action evidently varies depending on<br/>\npersonality. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps we would be more accurate to say that some children &quot;need/enjoy more<br/>\nadvance planning to feel secure&quot; than simply say &quot;demand structure&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

The prior post was just an opportunity to ask the question of<br/>\neveryone that has been nagging at me for a while every time someone posts<br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing workbooks is not the same as asking for structure. Asking for any of<br/>\nthe myriad of tools around from books, to maps, to art supplies, to computer<br/>\ngames, to museum visits, to garden tools, to microscopes, etc, is not what I<br/>\nwould call &quot;demanding structure&quot;. I think of structure as being more<br/>\nintangible than a bunch of tools or objects. I think it relates to time<br/>\nmanagement and planning and scheduling, and maybe order and expectations,<br/>\nand possibly having someone other than the learner take responsibility for<br/>\nhow the learner engages in these actions (of time management and so on).   <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople often say the phrase &quot;Some kids demand/need/want/ask for structure&quot;.<br/>\nI want to know what that looks like when they ask (maybe I have been missing<br/>\nsomething with Jayn). I want to know if it is relevant to children who have<br/>\nnever been in the time proscribed atmosphere of school or school-at-home. I<br/>\nwant to know what people mean when they say &quot;structure&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
