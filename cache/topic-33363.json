We attended the NEU Conference last weekend (and<br/>\nmet Ren -- hi, Ren!). We&#39;ve been unschooling/homeschooling for five<br/>\nyears, but this was our first time attending an unschooling<br/>\nconference. If only I had attended a conference in the beginning!<br/>\n<br/>\nA little bit of our history: We began homeschooling after checking out<br/>\nthe Albany Free School as an alternative to public school for our<br/>\nolder daughter when she was in first grade. I immediately loved the<br/>\nconcept of unschooling, and thought, &quot;We can do this at home!&quot; And so<br/>\nwe did. The first year we spent totally deschooling. The next year,<br/>\nand the years following, I added curriculum. What grief I could have<br/>\nsaved myself and my family if I had seen more real, live RUing<br/>\nfamilies in action (as opposed to an RUing school)! We&#39;ve met lots of<br/>\nhomeschoolers over the years, but the majority of them do school at<br/>\nhome. RU, however, is where my heart has always been. And now that<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen it in action with such intensity, and seen examples of so<br/>\nmany wonderful children, teenagers and unschooling families, I feel<br/>\nset free in several ways!<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the conference I&#39;ve noticed that I no longer feel the need to<br/>\nconvince mainstream-minded people that our family is doing &quot;school at<br/>\nhome.&quot; If they want to believe that, fine, but I won&#39;t lie and say<br/>\nwe&#39;re doing things we aren&#39;t. I feel more comfortable correcting<br/>\npeople (especially family) when they ask assumption-loaded questions.<br/>\nAnd I let their shock or disapproving silence roll off my back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also noticed that it no longer makes me so uncomfortable to be<br/>\naround teachers or families who talk about nothing but school. I&#39;ve<br/>\ncome to terms with the fact that I simply don&#39;t want that life for my<br/>\nchildren. If others want it for theirs, that&#39;s fine, but I&#39;ve grown<br/>\nmuch more comfortable in my own shoes!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conference has given me a picture of unschooling as a *normal* way<br/>\nof living. It doesn&#39;t seem like such a freak alternative for weirdos<br/>\nanymore. I&#39;ve seen firsthand that there are plenty of families doing<br/>\nit, and that they are some of the most amazing, interesting, open, and<br/>\nwarm people alive!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls were dreading the conference before we went, but they had a<br/>\nblast and can&#39;t wait for the next one (we plan on attending Live and<br/>\nLearn in the fall). To anyone who was at the NEUC -- thanks for being<br/>\nso open and sharing with your lives. It was truly an unforgettable and<br/>\nlife altering experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheryl</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":296701175,"authorName":"cherapple","from":"&quot;cherapple&quot; &lt;mosaicknits@...&gt;","profile":"cherapple","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Introduction & How the NEU Conference has changed me","postDate":"1212355835","msgId":33363,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcxdjRkcisxMG4zOEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33365,"prevInTime":33362,"nextInTime":33364,"topicId":33363,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m Cheryl from upstate NY, mom to two daughters, Andrea (almost 12) and Jessa (9).
