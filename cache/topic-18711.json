I decided I did not care if my daughter ever learned another thing in her life.  Her happiness and her well being were more important than anything.  Her going through the pure torture of public school just so she could be so called educated just was not worth it.  Bringing her home, loving her, playing with her, cuddling with her, talking to her, etc. is SOOOOO much more important than whether she knows what 6 X 6 is.  These are all important with my other daughter also, but my 8 year old was so damaged and she definately needs the healing.  I have family members who think it&#39;s ok for children to be teased at school and that it toughens them up.  Sorry, it&#39;s not o.k. and it was not o.k. to leave my child in that situation.  My daughters were adopted out of the foster care system and their lives prior to coming to my husband and I were more hell than anyone should have to endure in a lifetime.  So ps just became<br/>\n more hell for them.  It&#39;s definately time for them to heal.  And seeing the smiles on their faces, and getting the best hugs from them is proof I&#39;m doing the right thing.  <br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nSchafer Vanessa &lt;psychomom95@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Sandy,<br/>\n<br/>\nI forgot to ask you what kind of damage you were<br/>\ntalking about?
