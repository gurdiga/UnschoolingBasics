Very long story short - before he was <br/>\ndiagnosed with Leukemia, they had his meds fairly well balanced. <br/>\nUnfortunately, through our research of causes of this particular type of <br/>\nleukemia, we found out that the particular med combo he was on has a fairly <br/>\nhigh risk of being one of the many causes.  Whether the cause is the <br/>\ncombination of drugs or the bipolar predisposing someone to immune issues is <br/>\na whole other debate.  At this point he uses Prozac and holistic measures to <br/>\nremain balanced.  For the majority of the time it works out well.<br/>\n    More than anything, most of our issues stem from his really crappy <br/>\nchildhood (alcoholism, drugs, physical & mental abuse) and old patterns that <br/>\nseem to be resolved only to pop up again and again.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb.

Or, is it that it&#39;s <br/>\nalways going to be the wife/mother/woman in this position since she <br/>\nis the primary childcare giver during the early years? &lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first thought after reading your question was, &quot;Of course, there <br/>\nare millions of husbands who feel they have to treat their wives as <br/>\nanother child; just look at the number of overbearing, budget <br/>\ncontrolling, domineering, bullying in the name of training <br/>\nhusbands.&quot;  In my childhood as well as in dh&#39;s it most certainly was <br/>\nthat way.  That was the expected behavior of the dad and husband.  <br/>\nBut on the other hand the &quot;expected&quot; behavior of the mom and wife was <br/>\nto &quot;obey&quot; the &quot;man of the house&quot; and to live up to his expectations <br/>\nand demands, while &quot;training&quot; the children to do the same.  Yuck!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy goal is to live a different kind of life.  I care passionately <br/>\nabout making that change, but dh, not so much yet.  He kind of liked <br/>\nthinking that it was acceptable behavior to be the &quot;King of the <br/>\nHousehold&quot; in much the same way that his father did.  When I learned <br/>\nbetter, I did better.  *I* have to be the one to SHOW dh that it DOES <br/>\nfeel better when everyone is respected and valued and given real <br/>\nvalidation and choice, and that means treating HIM that way as much <br/>\nas any child.  It&#39;s really kind of crazy to think that just because I <br/>\nfound something that I think is &quot;better&quot; that he would <br/>\nautomatically &quot;get it&quot; and make a complete change based on no <br/>\npersonal experience.  He really didn&#39;t care a lot about what was <br/>\ngoing on at home as long as HIS needs were being met.  But the thing <br/>\nis that his needs WEREN&#39;T really being met because I was so resentful <br/>\nand sarcastic and quick to internally condemn &quot;his selfishness&quot; that <br/>\nhe couldn&#39;t possibly feel safe or welcome, loved, or truly part of <br/>\nthe family.  The best meal really doesn&#39;t taste very good when served <br/>\nwith a big ol&#39; side of resentment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing about this lifestyle is that it&#39;s about EVERYBODY&#39;S needs <br/>\nbeing met, and balancing that is quite the challenge when you&#39;re <br/>\nlearning something that&#39;s never been modeled.  So when I say that <br/>\nI &quot;treat dh like another child&quot; what I mean is that I don&#39;t expect <br/>\nhim to behave any differently than he always has just because I <br/>\ndecided to change some things.  By &quot;treating him like a child&quot; I mean <br/>\nextending to him the same freedom, support, choice, kindness, <br/>\nforgiveness, respect and attention that I extend to ds.  It&#39;s the <br/>\nbackward but same thinking as, &quot;Would I treat dh/friend the way I am <br/>\ntreating my child?&quot;  I had some pretty lofty expectations that dh <br/>\nwould behave in the parental and spousal manner that I thought he <br/>\nshould, without showing him why or how.  I assumed a lot, and you <br/>\nknow about ass-u-me-ing....<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that those who are capable are the ones who <br/>\nshould &quot;lead/show&quot; by example.  Right now in this situation I&#39;m the <br/>\none who is capable and wants to see the changes.  Therefore it IS up <br/>\nto me to demonstrate WHY I believe this path is one worth walking.  I <br/>\ncan encourage or discourage my partner into joining me on this path <br/>\nby how I choose to treat him.  I strive to make it a safe, <br/>\nfulfilling, and enjoyable experience for all of us.  Sometimes it <br/>\nmeans stepping back and seeing how far we&#39;ve come rather than how far <br/>\nwe still have to go.  It&#39;s not about &quot;being there&quot; but about finding <br/>\nthe good in each and every day.  Knowing that we are working <br/>\nTOWARD &quot;better&quot; and keeping that at my center every day is what <br/>\nsometimes keeps me going.  And it&#39;s worth it, especially in being <br/>\nable to model &quot;better&quot; and striving for harmony for ds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of people think, &quot;Well what about me?  Who is showing me <br/>\nrespect or consideration; who is meeting my needs?&quot;  To that I say <br/>\nthat my need for a peaceful and joyful family encompasses most every <br/>\nother need I have.  If my family is FEELING the love they will be <br/>\ncapable of sharing the love.  It has to start somewhere, so if it is <br/>\nto be then it has to start with me.  It doesn&#39;t come out of thin air, <br/>\nit&#39;s something that has to be created.<br/>\n<br/>\nPay it forward,<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140885507,"authorName":"Kathleen Gehrke","from":"&quot;Kathleen Gehrke&quot; &lt;gehrkes@...&gt;","profile":"gehrkes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling through divorce","postDate":"1203461625","msgId":30054,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZwZm1scCtpNTF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENENzQwRjE2LUY3OEYtNDMwRS1BRkIxLTc4M0Y0Nzk4MTM0QkBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30052,"nextInTopic":30066,"prevInTime":30053,"nextInTime":30055,"topicId":29951,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... children ...

So if they were to share <br/>\nhere, they would probably be in that position. It&#39;s just that the <br/>\noverwhelming majority here are moms.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not wild about considering treating Ben as &quot;another child&quot;---nor <br/>\nwould I appreciate it if he referred to me that way. &lt;g&gt; I look at it <br/>\nas treating *all* members of our family as important and worthy and <br/>\nvalued. And yes, Ben treats me that way too. &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s that Golden Rule <br/>\nthang.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes dads are so removed from the day-to-day goings-on because <br/>\nthey&#39;re simply not there---they&#39;re *literally* removed. To assume that <br/>\ndads can understand and grasp this concept when absent (when some of <br/>\nthe moms who are working at it both online with us and at home with <br/>\ntheir kids are having a very difficult time making changes) is a large <br/>\norder! Treating them (our husbands) as whole and learning and wanting <br/>\nthe best for their kids too is a kind and generous way to go about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe assume our children want to be the best people they can be, and by <br/>\ntreating them that way, they can&#39;t help but BE the best people they can <br/>\nbe. Why would treating our spouses the same way not work?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately many come with some ugly baggage that is hard to shed. <br/>\nBut when they know we want the best for THEM too (and that it&#39;s not <br/>\nalways mom-&-the-kids against the dad), they&#39;re more likely to join us <br/>\non the journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that Ben and I are better spouses---not just better <br/>\nparents---due to this lifestyle/philosophy change.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust before finding unschooling, Ben and I attended Retrouvaille. I <br/>\ncannot recommend it enough as far as saving our marriage. It&#39;s a <br/>\nCatholic church thing, but they do NOT push the religion bit---I mean, <br/>\nif *I* can attend it, *anyone* can! &lt;g&gt; Retrouvaille got us out of the <br/>\npit.

This is a lifestyle that is learned by FEELINGS -- if it <br/>\nfeels better, then of course go with what brings joy.  But it&#39;s not <br/>\njust for the kids!  I&#39;ve found that extending these principles to dh <br/>\nhas been WAY harder, but ultimately WAY more influential in the grand <br/>\nscheme of achieving family happiness.  I really do think <br/>\nthat &quot;unschooling our partners&quot; is the biggest piece of finding the <br/>\njoy we&#39;re seeking.  If I don&#39;t show dh how to live differently and <br/>\nhow it feels BETTER to live differently then of course he will have <br/>\nno reason to ever change.  I&#39;m not saying I expect him to change - <br/>\nI&#39;m saying that one *cannot* change if they do not see or feel any <br/>\nbenefits of changing.  Prior to this I gave a lot of ultimatums and <br/>\ndid a lot of talking, which never feels good for anyone and rarely <br/>\ndoes anything other than send fear and resentment.  When I decided to <br/>\nBE KIND and to treat dh at least as well as I treated ds... then he <br/>\nfelt better and wanted to participate in our lives more.  It&#39;s that <br/>\nwhole rules vs. principles thing.  This life is amazing!<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":215778715,"authorName":"Jodi Bezzola","from":"Jodi Bezzola &lt;jodibezzola@...&gt;","profile":"jodibezzola","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Unschooling through divorce","postDate":"1203446658","msgId":30040,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMwMTkwMC4xOTIzNy5xbUB3ZWI1NDEwNy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGZwZjVidCt2Z29pQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30034,"nextInTopic":30044,"prevInTime":30039,"nextInTime":30041,"topicId":29951,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~~The other thing I would suggest is that giving this lifestyle a chance and extending it to dh will probably, over time, bring some positive changes as","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-215224429\">~~~The other thing I would suggest is that giving this lifestyle a chance <br/>\nand extending it to dh will probably, over time, bring some positive <br/>\nchanges as well..

It&#39;s <br/>\nbeen so worth it.~~<br/>\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n   <br/>\n  This post speak very clearly to my situation.  I can *so* relate to all that has been shared in this thread!  Dh and I are going through a pretty rocky time , in fact just about every day I think about leaving, usually after yet another conflict that leaves me feeling pretty hopeless and exhausted about how things are between us right now.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have received the message so many times that &#39;if it is to be it is up to me&#39;, and MAN, do I hate hearing that!  I too have felt so often like I shouldn&#39;t have to give as much as I give, to the girls, to dh, and then I sit and think of the alternative.  Me committed to being home with the girls, dh not making enough to support 2 households, me being a single mama with no other adult in the house hardly at all, the girls missing their dad all the time, the message it would send to the girls about how hard we work for those we love, etc., these are all things that run through my mind.  I can love and hate that man in the space of 3 seconds it seems!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  And to be honest (and when I&#39;m being totally out of denial and blaming him), I see that I can be just a little challenging to be in relationship with too!!  It has helped me *immeasureably* to treat dh like a third child.  To apply the unschooling principles to him as well as to the girls.  To give him freedom.  To let him see what we&#39;re doing and work it out for himself.  I have no idea if it will come back to me yet, since I&#39;m still in the giving giving giving phase of all this.  I just wanted to encourage you as well to look at the big picture.  My dh was raised in a family where what was really going on was never mentioned, and it&#39;s a completely new thought to him (much to my amazement) that his childhood has anything to do with how he parents and is relationship now!  So he&#39;s beginning his journey, and we&#39;re along for the ride &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

I&#39;m one who has &quot;stuck it out&quot; even when <br/>\neveryone else told me to leave... and I&#39;m so glad that I have.  One <br/>\nquestion that really helped me to wrap my brain around the possibility <br/>\nof *staying* was, &quot;Would things really be BETTER if we weren&#39;t <br/>\ntogether?&quot;  Of course they would be different, but would they be <br/>\nBETTER?  Using your example - would your daughter have calmed down any <br/>\nsooner if dh was not in the house?  Knowing he&#39;s in the next room but <br/>\nnot visible might be more comforting than knowing you have no immediate <br/>\naccess.  Yes, it feels like rejection when he&#39;s not willing to give a <br/>\nfew minutes generously, but would it feel less like rejection if he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t there at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not here to judge *anything;* I encourage you to think about <br/>\nthe &quot;big picture&quot; and not just the details.  Details pile up into big <br/>\nheaps, but even the heaps don&#39;t block out the whole picture.  Back up <br/>\naway from the piles and the heaps until you can see the giant picture.  <br/>\nIf you can see the entire horizon and can SEE the BETTER, then maybe <br/>\nyou can stay in the picture and find the better at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I would suggest is that giving this lifestyle a chance <br/>\nand extending it to dh will probably, over time, bring some positive <br/>\nchanges as well.  Using your example, how would you have handled dh&#39;s <br/>\nreaction if he was another child?  So often we get caught up in <br/>\nexpecting our partners to &quot;behave like adults&quot; (whatever that means) <br/>\nthat we fail to treat them as well as we do our children.  How would <br/>\nyou have handled it if dh was a child instead of dh?  Would following <br/>\nhim into the space he retreated into have seemed kind?  Mainstream <br/>\nthinking expects that adults will be in control and that we &quot;train&quot; our <br/>\nchildren to &quot;be in control.&quot;  That&#39;s not this lifestyle&#39;s goal.  The <br/>\ngoal is joyful living.  If you can possibly extend that generousity to <br/>\nyour dh and think in terms of helping *him* to feel better as well as <br/>\nyour dd, you&#39;ll be further on your way to BETTER.  I know it&#39;s a tough <br/>\nmind change and requires a lot of generousity!  But as one person who <br/>\nhas BTDT, I can highly recommend it as worthwhile and as WAY BETTER <br/>\nthan I could have ever imagined when I started!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been on this life journey for 2 years now, and I can&#39;t even begin <br/>\nto tell you how drastically different our marriage and family have <br/>\nbecome through this life.

It is wonderful to have so many active people being so <br/>\nopen about what has and hasn&#39;t worked in their lives.<br/>\n    I haven&#39;t been a member long, so I&#39;m not sure if there are folks on this <br/>\nlist who could help give me some suggestions.  My dh & I are contemplating <br/>\nseparation.  He&#39;s not a bad person or a bad father, but we are definitely at <br/>\nvery different places in our lives at the moment.  We will not part ways <br/>\nuntil we can be certain that I am still able to be at home with our daughter <br/>\n(almost 2).  While we may not be able to parent her under the same roof <br/>\ntogether, we will not sacrifice her well-being for our own.  My biggest <br/>\nconcern about staying is modeling our relationships as an acceptable way to <br/>\nlive - which I fell very strongly it is not!  While we can be cordial and <br/>\nrespectful with one another, the affection and closeness is gone.  We view <br/>\nlife from very different perspectives.  Anyway, I don&#39;t really want to get <br/>\ninto any kind of &quot;blame game&quot; here - there are things we both could&#39;ve done <br/>\ndifferently.<br/>\n    So I guess my main questions is - how do you protect the little ones <br/>\nwhen dealing with such &quot;adult&quot; issues that effect every aspect of their <br/>\nlives???<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb.
