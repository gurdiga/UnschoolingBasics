For your son he learns <br/>\nbest through watching and talking.  The first thing that I had to <br/>\nget over was the idea that my kids had to be &quot;on grade level.&quot;  You <br/>\nhave to decide if being &quot;on grade level&quot; is an appropriate standard <br/>\nto measure your children.  We pulled our children from school for <br/>\nmany reasons, but many of us did so because we saw the school <br/>\nsystems failing our children (not letter grades, but letting them <br/>\ndown.)  They were bored, uninterested, antsy, labelled, humiliated, <br/>\nheld back (either grade wise or learning wise), test-driven, etc.  <br/>\nWhat does it really mean to read on a second grade level?  It&#39;s an <br/>\narbitrary list of words that some committee (that probably doesn&#39;t <br/>\nknow children well at all) came up with that they think children <br/>\nshould be able to read.  What if you have a child who isn&#39;t <br/>\nphysically and emotionally ready to read?  I think many children are <br/>\nhindered when it comes to reading because they aren&#39;t ready and are <br/>\nmade to feel stupid.  They have to be in &quot;reading group 1&quot; which <br/>\neveryone knows is where the &quot;stupid&quot; kids are.  Or they are sent <br/>\nto &quot;remedial reading.&quot;  UGH!!!  Letting go of the entire &quot;my kids <br/>\nneed to know X by Y&quot; is a big step, but if you trust that your <br/>\nchildren are experiencing life and thusly learning through those <br/>\nexperiences, then you will be on the road to learning freedom.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo your son learns best from watching and talking.  Sounds like a <br/>\ngreat place to talk about what he is interested in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209727179,"authorName":"luv_my_three_kids","from":"&quot;luv_my_three_kids&quot; &lt;elaina.morrison@...&gt;","profile":"luv_my_three_kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Hi everyone, new here and looking more into unschooling","postDate":"1112992434","msgId":5374,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQzNnByaStxa2pmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5377,"prevInTime":5373,"nextInTime":5375,"topicId":5374,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi my name is Elaina.
