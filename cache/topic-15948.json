It <br/>\nhas a piano in it and all of my husband&#39;s clothes and shoes. When he <br/>\ncomes home from work he changes out of his work clothes in there, but <br/>\nhe goes in and out of there at other times for other reasons. He often <br/>\nleaves the light on. I notice it fairly quickly because I&#39;m always <br/>\ngoing in and out of the laundry room or the bathroom and you can see <br/>\nthe &quot;piano room&quot; from both. So I&#39;ll just yell toward the living room, <br/>\n&quot;Are you done in the piano room?&quot; Because why turn it off if he&#39;s going <br/>\nback in a minute? And he&#39;ll yell back that he&#39;s done and I&#39;ll turn it <br/>\noff. No big deal. He gets a subtle non-blamey reminder that he left it <br/>\non, and I get to save a few hundredths of a penny on electricity, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d hate it if our roles were reversed and DH was harping on me all the <br/>\ntime for wasting electricity, so when I feel myself starting to slip in <br/>\nto lecture mode about it I bite my tongue. I think it&#39;s a good way to <br/>\nmodel to Charlotte, a) we speak respectfully to each other even when <br/>\nthe other person is a bit forgetful or wasteful and b) it&#39;s good to <br/>\nturn things off when you&#39;re not using them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vijay<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 22, 2006, at 8:35 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Genant2@...\">Genant2@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 7/22/2006 8:02:01 A.M.

Our family room lights get left on  all the <br/>\ntime, it is in our basement.  That doesn&#39;t mean that I want to go  down all the <br/>\ntime and shut them off, LOL.  I don&#39;t usually try to find out  who left them <br/>\non either, LOL.  Not that important who did it.  What I  usually do is just try <br/>\nto remember that the next time I go down there for  something to turn them <br/>\noff , or I will mention to everyone within earshot, that  whoever goes down next <br/>\nto try to remember to turn them off on the way up the  stairs.  Usually one <br/>\nof us will be going down there for something in the  next 15 minutes.  I just <br/>\ndon&#39;t see the lights in the basement as that much  of a priority.  It is just <br/>\nas likely that it was me that left them on as  anyone else.  I know my youngest <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like to have the dark room behind  him while he is coming up the <br/>\nstairs so he will leave them on.  To me that  sounds reasonable, I would do the <br/>\nsame in his situation.  <br/>\n <br/>\nNot trying to suggest that the posts so far are in any  way &quot;off the mark&quot; <br/>\njust that I see another option.  Not turning them  off.  Instead of who turns <br/>\nthem off, or at least not right this minute. <br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe look for different solutions in those situations.
