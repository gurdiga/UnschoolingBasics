However, I have to agree with Kelly when she said that  <br/>\nyou have to be with them all the time. When Bre was little, we never  <br/>\nleft her alone with anyone, because we never KNEW for certain that it  <br/>\nwas safe. She sat in the bathroom and played with toys, or eat  <br/>\nsnacks, or shower with me. Or I didn&#39;t bath until a friend or dh  <br/>\ncould be in the house to watch her.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing that she&#39;s not doing it on purpose is helpful to *your*  <br/>\nbrain, but doesn&#39;t help other people. She may not at this point be  <br/>\nable to help herself, but it&#39;s your job to help her help herself.  <br/>\nYou&#39;re her translator, mediator, and close companion until she does  <br/>\nget it. And it does happen, it takes longer, and it takes a lot of  <br/>\nintensive time on your part. I wanted to emphasize what someone said  <br/>\nwhen they said you have to catch her meltdowns before they happen,  <br/>\nand walk her through more appropriate stages. At this point, she has  <br/>\ningrained so many bad reactions that it is second nature for her, and  <br/>\nit&#39;ll seem much more intense for a while. But soon you&#39;ll start to be  <br/>\nable to trust her for five minutes, or ten, or even an hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving SPD means that things are really intense for her, and I&#39;d  <br/>\nsuggest lots of opportunity for activity, lots of full body activity  <br/>\nlike jumping on the tramp, swinging, climbing, riding a bike, and  <br/>\nlots of fine motor play with playdough, clay, origami, bubbles. Not  <br/>\nonly does it help get rid of the nervous energy created by the  <br/>\nconstant onslaught of input, it also helps the nervous system mature.  <br/>\nSInetwork.org is a great website if you need ideas or maybe a  <br/>\nconsultation with an OT, sometimes just getting ideas is worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (9), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (5), Dan  <br/>\n(3), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 16, 2006, at 2:00 PM, Kelly Weyd wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; You may be onto something.........I&#39;m not sure.

I am also in SC.  I swear fish oil has practically cured my daughters ADD, and helped my own ADD tremendously.  So I am all for the natural/alternative route.  If I feel good, and the kids feel good things are a whole lot better around here.  Homeopathy I&#39;m sure would help my daughter with SPD and possibel AS, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s in the budget right now.  I think I have come a long way in my own parenting skills in the last year, and just last night my husband complemented me on what a wonderful Mother I was.  I used to have no patience and was just frustrated all the time.  Over the last year I&#39;ve changed everything, and look at everything differently now.......obviously I had to change my thinking because my stinky attitude just was not working.  So I&#39;m hoping that in time Mariah will &quot;get it&quot;.  She has so many other wonderful qualities, and I want those qualities to stand out instead of them being over-shadowed by the fact<br/>\n that she is being obnoxious, and hitting.

Now my 6 year <br/>\nold daughter has Sensory Processing Disorder, and exhibits some <br/>\nsymptoms of Aspergers.  Now for the most part I can reason with my 8 <br/>\nyear old as to why she should not hit her sister or another child, <br/>\nand she gets it.  My 6 year old is a whole other story.  First off <br/>\nwith her issues she is very prone to flying into a rage......which <br/>\nas time has gone by she has learned to go to her room where she <br/>\nscreams, kicks the door and gets it out of her system.  But what <br/>\nreally bothers me is she has no empathy or compassion (a very common <br/>\nsymptom of SPD/AS kids), so I can not reason with this child as to <br/>\nwhy she should not hit her sister or another child.  My poor 8 year <br/>\nold gets punched, kicked, pinched, etc. on a regular basis and it&#39;s <br/>\nusually unprovoked.  I could talk to my six year old till I was blue <br/>\nin the face and she does not get it.  She generally can&#39;t play with <br/>\nother children without me being there.  Socially she is a disaster, <br/>\nwhich I&#39;ve been told is another trait of AS/SPD.  When someone <br/>\nwrongs her she hits or punches them.  And it could be over something <br/>\nas simple as they won&#39;t play the game she wants to play.  Punishing <br/>\nor talking would do no good......we have been that route.  We have <br/>\ntried the role playing, etc. with no luck.  I&#39;ve tried to tell her <br/>\nthe only thing she can hurt is a pillow.....no luck.  Today she <br/>\ntried to run over the neighbors cat with her bike for the 100th <br/>\ntime, and for the 100th time I tried explaining to her why she <br/>\nshould not do that.  I feel like I&#39;m just spinning my tires over <br/>\nhere.  Now I should add that my six year old is also very bright.  <br/>\nShe figured out how to read all on her own when she was 4.  She was <br/>\nreading chapter books in kindy, while the other kids were learning <br/>\ntheir ABC&#39;s.  Public School bored her to tears, and it was one of <br/>\nmany reasons I decided to take them out.  So anyone out there have <br/>\nany suggestions on how to not punish her, but to help her get the <br/>\nmessage to not hit and punch.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18097,"nextTopicId":18329}}
