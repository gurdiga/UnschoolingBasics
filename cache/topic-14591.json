But. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nParents do have the ability to force their kids to do all kinds of  <br/>\nthings - including sitting at the dinner table or staying on a soccer  <br/>\nteam, etc. So, it is really a straightforward fact that we DO allow  <br/>\nour kids to make all kinds of choices for themselves, that most  <br/>\nparents don&#39;t.  I mean - I am &quot;allowing&quot; my husband to sit and watch  <br/>\nseemingly endless hours of uninterrupted world cup soccer. He doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nneed my permission, but I could most definitely prevent him from  <br/>\ndoing it (by being loud, interrupting, making demands about wanting  <br/>\nto use the tv, myself, etc. And yet, what a weird way to think of it,  <br/>\nhuh?<br/>\n<br/>\n  If I said to a friend, &quot;This month I am allowing my husband to  <br/>\nwatch a lot of tv,&quot; my friend would think that was a very strange  <br/>\nthing for me to say about my husband. The radical unschoolers here  <br/>\nthought that was a weird thing to say about a child, too. Instead of  <br/>\nthinking about what I will &quot;allow&quot; my husband to do, I thought in  <br/>\nterms of how we could support his interest in watching 100 and some  <br/>\nsoccer games in 30 days.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is good to stop &quot;thinking&quot; in terms of &quot;What will I allow my kids  <br/>\nto do.&quot; I agree with that, of course. Instead, that kind of thinking  <br/>\ncan be replaced with, &quot;How can I help my kids do what they want to do?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, underneath that way of thinking and being with our kids, there  <br/>\nis a reality that &quot;we&quot; are allowing this entire lifestyle to occur -  <br/>\nwe do have power to not allow it, and most parents use that power.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - there are two different points - both using the word, &quot;allow.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n1. As unschooling parents we&#39;ve chosen to allow a lot - we allow our  <br/>\nkids to not go to school, to live free of being schooled, to make  <br/>\nmany choices such as what to eat, when to sleep, what to watch, do,  <br/>\nsay, and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. We don&#39;t generally think in terms of &quot;allowing&quot; a kid to do or not  <br/>\ndo most things. Whether or not we will &quot;allow&quot; it is not the relevant  <br/>\nquestion, for us. The question is &quot;how&quot; we can help the kid get when  <br/>\nhe/she wants. In doing that, we think about how we can help the child  <br/>\nunderstand all the possible repercussions of his/her decision, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Allowing a child to quit","postDate":"1150475820","msgId":14644,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyNTY1MEZELUY0NTctNDlDMi1BRkU5LUMyQUFENjU5OTVFNkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU2c2liMitkNDJ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU2c2liMitkNDJ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":14643,"nextInTopic":14646,"prevInTime":14643,"nextInTime":14645,"topicId":14591,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But the parents shouldn&#39;t be  <br/>\ntelling their kid that the team &quot;needs&quot; them or that they&#39;d be  <br/>\n&quot;letting the team down&quot; if it isn&#39;t really true. Doesn&#39;t help in  <br/>\nsupporting an honest, strong parent-child relationship. AND, the  <br/>\npurpose of youth sports is to have fun - yes, lots of learning about  <br/>\nlife happens on a youth sports team, but if the kid isn&#39;t having fun,  <br/>\nthe coach and other adults are failing the kid - they&#39;ve already  <br/>\nfailed in THEIR obligation, and there is no reason to force a kid to  <br/>\nstay on the team when the adults in charge are not carrying through  <br/>\non what they should be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may sound extreme, but the attitude of &quot;finishing what you  <br/>\nstart&quot; or &quot;honoring your commitments&quot;  is, unfortunately, the exact  <br/>\nattitude that keeps people in abusive marriages.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids haven&#39;t wanted to continue on a sports team, we&#39;ve  <br/>\ntalked it out and tried to figure out what the kid liked about being  <br/>\non the team and what wasn&#39;t working. On one team, the coach called  <br/>\nthe kids by their last names and we have a really hard name, so every  <br/>\ntime he wanted to call my daughter&#39;s name, he flubbed it and kind of  <br/>\nlaughed. She was being embarrassed over and over - felt he was  <br/>\nlaughing at her name. I told him about this - and he said, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m  <br/>\nlaughing because I&#39;m embarrassed that I can&#39;t get it right.&quot; So -  <br/>\nthere was a critical moment - if he was willing to practice it and  <br/>\nget it right and stop laughing when he said it - to honor the fact  <br/>\nthat a little girl was getting her feelings hurt - then that would be  <br/>\nfine. There were other things about him she wasn&#39;t liking (think  <br/>\nabout a coach who calls little girls by their last names) but she&#39;d  <br/>\nhave stayed on the team if he&#39;d shown remorse. But, no, he insisted  <br/>\nSHE was the one who had to get over it, she was being too sensitive,  <br/>\nand that once he&#39;d explained he wasn&#39;t laughing at her, she should  <br/>\njust be okay. She wasn&#39;t. So she left the team.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother year, another coach, he was having the kids run around the  <br/>\ntrack at the field where they practiced. Roya was a pretty slow  <br/>\nrunner - and lagged behind a bit. They were 9 year old girls. When  <br/>\nshe&#39;d lag behind, the coach would be yelling at her from a distance,  <br/>\n&quot;Get going! Don&#39;t let them beat you!&quot; stuff that was intended to be  <br/>\nencouraging, I&#39;m sure. But, some of the other girls would finish  <br/>\nfirst and then THEY would start yelling stuff, too, and it wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nnice. The coach&#39;s daughter was one of them and he didn&#39;t stop it. She  <br/>\ndecided to leave the team after the first three weeks of practice,  <br/>\nbefore the games actually started. I knew we&#39;d done the right thing  <br/>\nbecause the coach never even asked why she decided to quit. She was  <br/>\nslow, so he was glad to see her go, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have stayed ON teams even they didn&#39;t like the coach&#39;s  <br/>\nbehavior, too. Sometimes the playing was important enough to them to  <br/>\nmake them want to put up with stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve never &quot;just quit.&quot; They&#39;ve thought it through and made a  <br/>\nchoice. And the impact of their behavior on others was always a part  <br/>\nof the mix of things considered, but it is NOT necessarily the only  <br/>\nconsideration, by any means.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150688296,"authorName":"Kiersten Pasciak","from":"&quot;Kiersten Pasciak&quot; &lt;kjl8@...&gt;","profile":"kierstenpasciak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Team Commitments/Character Traits","postDate":"1150470510","msgId":14639,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU2dWhoZSs0ZjJjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxYmIwMWM2OTBlYyRiMWM1N2ZmMCRmMTcxYjE0MkBrcmlzdGluPg=="},"prevInTopic":14637,"nextInTopic":14642,"prevInTime":14638,"nextInTime":14640,"topicId":14591,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ever ...

My kids participate in Odyssey of the Mind (OM). Teams consist of<br/>\n5-7 kids. No more than 7 kids can help on a problem which means if a team of<br/>\n7 has a member quit, that team member cannot be replaced. My son&#39;s team had<br/>\nall experienced OM kids. They had worked together before. Something happened<br/>\nthis year though, they just were not gelling.  Their ages are 11-15 and<br/>\nsometimes kids that do well together when they are young, don&#39;t always do<br/>\nwell together as teens. This team had 6 members and two ended up quiting<br/>\nwell into the season. They were very unhappy being part of the team. The<br/>\nrest of the team spent a lot  of energy trying to make them happy. Nobody<br/>\nwas doing anything wrong. But it just wasn&#39;t working. The girls&#39; parents<br/>\nencouraged them to do what was best for them. The decision was not made<br/>\nlightly or easily.  They knew they had made a commitment. But no commitment<br/>\nshould be absolute at the cost of personal health. It was difficult when the<br/>\ngirls quit. There were hurt feelings on both sides.  But ultimately, the<br/>\nremaining team members were relieved they had left. They were now able to<br/>\nfocus all their energy on solving the problem. They added another team<br/>\nmember (since they only had 6 to begin with, they were able to do that) and<br/>\ndid a great job. The girls that left started a different team with a<br/>\ndifferent problem and had a blast.  They are all still friends.  It would<br/>\nhave been miserable for everyone if they had been forced to stay with the<br/>\nteam. These kids were able to work through this together. All the parents<br/>\nwere available and willing to help them as the decisions were being made.<br/>\nThe girls who left had to deal with the hurt feelings, but also received the<br/>\ngift of being allowed to listen to their hearts and do what they thought was<br/>\nbest for them. The kids left on the team learned that no one is<br/>\nindispensable. They had to deal with what they might have done to contribute<br/>\nto their desire to leave and to accept that, in part, it was nothing anybody<br/>\ndid, just personality conflict. It happens to the best of us. My point is<br/>\nthat, though it was difficult for everyone, more was learned by allowing the<br/>\ngirls free choice to leave then would have been learned by making them stay.<br/>\nKids who are forced to stay on a team or whatever to learn &#39;commitment&#39; miss<br/>\nout on learning even more valuable life lessons.<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-19, Lisa-17, Karl-15, & Ben-10.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reachhomeschool.com\">http://www.reachhomeschool.com</a><br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art www.artkunst23.com<br/>\n&quot;All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.&quot;<br/>\n  Gandalf the Grey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 6/16/06, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Here&#39;s the point people are trying to make in a nutshell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We *have* kids -- older kids who are able to take on important<br/>\n&gt; commitments where others are honestly depending on them (pet sitting<br/>\n&gt; for instance) --- who take their commitments and obligations<br/>\n&gt; seriously.

(And then as  <br/>\nadults people have to spend big bucks to psychiatrists to get help to  <br/>\nlisten to the voices buried so deep inside them that tell them what  <br/>\nthey want from life!)<br/>\n<br/>\nChildhood is for learning about the consequences of our actions. They  <br/>\nlearn what if feels like when an adult makes a promise to them and  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t follow through. They learn that friends get hurt and mad when  <br/>\nthe child promises the friend something and doesn&#39;t do that. *That&#39;s*  <br/>\nhow kids internalize the importance of doing what others are  <br/>\ndepending on you to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can talk to them and help them see a bigger picture, some  <br/>\nconsequences they may not understand, when they want to quit or go  <br/>\nback on a promise or whatever. But as their partners we need to help  <br/>\nthem make the decisions that feel right to them so they can  <br/>\ninternalize that bigger picture by seeing what happens when they make  <br/>\na certain decision.

What to say? I&#39;ll go ahead and meet each one of your statements,<br/>\n&gt; and then try to tie it all together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think there&#39;s a big difference between choosing to play softball<br/>\n&gt; and riding your bike down a hill in the middle of the road. One is a<br/>\n&gt; safety issue, and one is not. What we&#39;ve done in our house is<br/>\n&gt; figured out why riding the bike down the hill in the middle of the<br/>\n&gt; road was important. There&#39;s a reason, they aren&#39;t doing it just to<br/>\n&gt; make you angry, or risk their lives. There&#39;s another factor. For our<br/>\n&gt; son, it was the only way to 1) get going as fast as he could, 2) roll<br/>\n&gt; easily with minimal work, and 3) there&#39;s a funny drop in your stomach<br/>\n&gt; when you top a hill. So we make it safe...we showed him how to look<br/>\n&gt; for cars, we kept an eye out, we took his bike to the lake with<br/>\n&gt; locked off roads, we took him to the local skate park.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the junk food, it&#39;s been said again, but I cannot emphasize how<br/>\n&gt; big of a difference it makes when kids can choose and aren&#39;t fearful<br/>\n&gt; of the wait until they are &quot;allowed&quot; more junk. My kids have eaten a<br/>\n&gt; ton of junk while recovering from my controlling habits. But they did<br/>\n&gt; get to the point where the junk isn&#39;t important. And they know they<br/>\n&gt; can have it whenever so they eat what makes them feel good, whether<br/>\n&gt; its chocolate, fruit, veggies, water, soda. It&#39;s all the same to<br/>\n&gt; them. Be sure to offer easy access fruits and veggies though. We use<br/>\n&gt; a tupperware divided tray to keep stuff out all the time. I usually<br/>\n&gt; put it away about 4pm to help them wait for supper, although if<br/>\n&gt; someone is hungry I&#39;ll tell them to help themselves to a smallish<br/>\n&gt; snack to help wait for supper.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Find different sunscreen. There are reasons kids don&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; sunscreen, maybe it takes too long while they are trying to go<br/>\n&gt; outside. Maybe they want to do it themselves. Maybe it smells bad,<br/>\n&gt; maybe it feels slick and icky. Maybe they accidently rub it in their<br/>\n&gt; eyes. Find alternatives. Provide light long screen tees. Get the<br/>\n&gt; sunscreen sticks. Get the aerosol spray, or the instant dry. Let them<br/>\n&gt; do it themselves. As them to play in the shade (and make it appealing<br/>\n&gt; to do so)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brushing their teeth. The only times my kids have gone three weeks<br/>\n&gt; without brushing is when I was being forceful about it and it was a<br/>\n&gt; powerstruggle. The older ones pretty much do it on their own now,<br/>\n&gt; every once in a while I&#39;ll notice the smell and ask &quot;have you<br/>\n&gt; considered brushing your teeth?&quot;, we&#39;ll laugh about it and they&#39;ll do<br/>\n&gt; it in an hour or two. There&#39;s nothing wrong about not bathing. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; actually pretty healthy not to scrub off your normal flora every<br/>\n&gt; day. ;-) When the scum starts sticking, it&#39;s uncomfortable to them<br/>\n&gt; and they ask for a bath. My two year old asks for a bath every time<br/>\n&gt; we change his pull-up. It&#39;s not an issue for him, he baths when he<br/>\n&gt; feels he needs to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; someone else already mentioned the softball deal, but i did want to<br/>\n&gt; reiterate...you are saying that the ability of a softball team to<br/>\n&gt; play is more important than the mental wellness of your child? If the<br/>\n&gt; team is that low on players, then there are other issues. Or in a<br/>\n&gt; league, it&#39;s better to drop out sooner so that the team members can<br/>\n&gt; be absorbed into other teams. If they truly do not like softball, why<br/>\n&gt; did they sign up? Because a parent or friend kept saying how much fun<br/>\n&gt; it would be, or to just try it? There are alternatives to that as  <br/>\n&gt; well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The rest of the email is all choices. I used to have a problem with<br/>\n&gt; that. I used to be angry because I *had* to do dishes. I *had* to do<br/>\n&gt; laundry. No, I don&#39;t. No one HAS to. The only thing you really *have*<br/>\n&gt; to do is breath, eat and poop. Everything else is choices. One might<br/>\n&gt; not like the consequences on not doing it, or even not making a<br/>\n&gt; choice, but the truth is that all is choice. and you can choose to be<br/>\n&gt; happy. I&#39;m still practicing that part. You say the choices affect the<br/>\n&gt; family..but they apparently aren&#39;t as bothered by it? I choose to<br/>\n&gt; clean up a child&#39;s vomit because I don&#39;t like the smell. I also clean<br/>\n&gt; it up because when I&#39;m sick, I don&#39;t like cleaning up my own. I<br/>\n&gt; appreciate someone showing enough care to help make my world nicer.<br/>\n&gt; The last time the little ones were sick, my seven year old woke up in<br/>\n&gt; the middle of the night to my four year old throwing up. Without ever<br/>\n&gt; waking me up, she took him to the bathroom, bathed him, helped him<br/>\n&gt; brush his teeth, cleaned up the puke, and put him back to bed. I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t know about it til the next morning. She didn&#39;t have to, but<br/>\n&gt; she chose to because she&#39;d seen it modeled when she was sick a few<br/>\n&gt; days before.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No one is saying to not parent your child. What they are saying is to<br/>\n&gt; be mindful, meaning that you carefully consider why you are telling<br/>\n&gt; your children this or that. Often we make choices based on the tapes<br/>\n&gt; in our heads from childhood, the ones that our parents used like<br/>\n&gt; &quot;What will so-n-so think?&quot; or &quot;because i said so&quot;. When you stop to<br/>\n&gt; consider why we say yes or no, it&#39;s usually very arbitrary reasons,<br/>\n&gt; and kids hear that. Once your children know that the BS is turned<br/>\n&gt; off, then when you say &quot;That&#39;s not safe&quot;, they listen. When you say,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s try it this way instead,&quot; they listen. Children don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; be unsafe, they don&#39;t want to be hurt or sick. They just want to live<br/>\n&gt; and learn. &quot;When a person becomes a parent, he or she will not only<br/>\n&gt; live through the experiences of the child, but will relive many of<br/>\n&gt; the experiences of the old child he or she once was. Reliving is an<br/>\n&gt; inseparable part of parenting&quot; (Mr Rogers) The hardest part of<br/>\n&gt; parenting is separating yourself from your child and letting them<br/>\n&gt; experience what they need to grow. It&#39;s letting go of the fear and<br/>\n&gt; pain, and giving them the opportunity to grow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Melissa<br/>\n&gt; Mom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan<br/>\n&gt; (2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; share our lives at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo\">http://360.yahoo</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a>&gt; com/multimomma<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Jun 15, 2006, at 9:12 AM, Trudy wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; During this discussion it seems as if some are suggesting that no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; matter what choice a child makes, you let them go with it so as to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not quash their spirit or intimate to the child that their choice is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unwise.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If my 5-year-old daring son wants to ride his bike out in the  <br/>\n&gt; road on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a hill and I have explained why it&#39;s not wise and what could happen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if he chooses to do so, do I let him anyway?

With that in mind, <br/>\nhere&#39;s my take on your concerns:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If my 5-year-old daring son wants to ride his bike out in the<br/>\n&gt; road on a hill and I have explained why it&#39;s not wise and what<br/>\n&gt; could happen if he chooses to do so, do I let him anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When I first learned about radical unschooling, I had this same <br/>\nincorrect assumption.  I think you&#39;re misunderstanding the balance <br/>\nof power here.  In a traditional family, the parents have all or <br/>\nmost of the power while the children mostly follow and obey.  <br/>\nTherefore, some people think that unschoolers must be opposite, <br/>\ngiving all the power to the children.  But rather than it being a <br/>\npower struggle at all, the idea is to find a happy balance!  We&#39;re <br/>\npartners.  So no, I would not let my child ride his bike where he <br/>\ncould possibly get harmed.  I would, however, help him find a place <br/>\nthat we both agree is acceptable to ride the bike.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If one of my children decides they want potato chips, Pepsi, and<br/>\n&gt; a snickers bar every day for breakfast and I have explained the<br/>\n&gt; unhealthy aspects of that, telling them about empty calories and<br/>\n&gt; lack of nutrition in the snacks they are occasionally allowed, do<br/>\n&gt; I let them do that so their choice will be honored?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes and No.  First, my guess is that after a while they may tire of <br/>\nthat same breakfast.  Second, adults have coffee as a regular <br/>\nbreakfast drink.  In fact, I think coffee has more caffeine than <br/>\ncoke does.  FWIW, I drink 2 cups of coffee in the morning with lots <br/>\nof sugar and half and half.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not the healthiest drink, <br/>\nbut I love it!  Would you feel better if he chose a big bowl of <br/>\nFruit Loops and kool-aid?  I say let them eat what they want, but <br/>\nadd to the choices.  Cut up an apple and put it near him.  Say <br/>\nsomething like &#39;I thought you might like this too.&#39;  But don&#39;t fuss <br/>\nif he says no.  If you make it a mandatory thing, you are taking <br/>\naway their choice.  I&#39;m reading a good book right now called _Let <br/>\nthem Eat Cake!  The Case Against Controlling What Your Children Eat_ <br/>\nby Robert E. Kleinman.  It&#39;s a very interesting read!  It reminds us <br/>\nthat children&#39;s metabolisms are different than adults and that <br/>\nhabits set in childhood don&#39;t always carry over into adulthood.  I <br/>\ncan tell you that my food choices are based on what I want and not <br/>\nwhat I did when I was a child.  I used to be able to eat sugar <br/>\ncereal and lots of candy and I&#39;ve truly lost my taste for such large <br/>\nquantities.  I still like sweets, but they don&#39;t monopolize my diet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also firmly believe that if you make foods forbidden, those foods <br/>\nwill be the ones the child craves the most and will go out of his <br/>\nway to attain.  I think it&#39;s better to present a multitude of <br/>\nchoices rather than limiting.  Kids will not always choose the junk <br/>\nfood at every meal.  Even if they do for a few days because it&#39;s a <br/>\nnovel idea, they&#39;ll tire of it quickly.  Their bodies will tell them <br/>\nYUCK.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They don&#39;t enjoy putting sunscreen on before playing outside.<br/>\n&gt; Well, that&#39;s their choice - if they get a severe burn, then so<br/>\n&gt; be it, I should require that it be done, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If they refuse it, let them try to go without it.  But watch them <br/>\nclosely.  After a while, their skin will start to redden.  Then you <br/>\nask them to come inside for a moment, like for a snack or something <br/>\nand say &#39;Wow, your skin is starting to look red.  I don&#39;t want you <br/>\nto get a sunburn because it can really hurt.  Would you like to see <br/>\nin the mirror?  And look at this new spray stuff I have, it&#39;s so <br/>\neasy and FAST to get on.&#39;  My kids used to hate getting sunscreen <br/>\nbecause the lotion took so long.  The spray is a huge hit.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What if they have chosen to not brush their teeth for three<br/>\n&gt; weeks?  What if they choose to not take a bath?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s okay to gently ask if they&#39;d like some help or even company <br/>\nwhile they bathe or brush teeth.  Sometimes they just feel like they <br/>\nare missing out if they spend a few minutes brushing teeth or have <br/>\nto get in the tub.  Offer to sit in there and talk with them, or <br/>\nread a book, or offer something afterwards like &#39;Hey, I wanted to <br/>\nplay [game name] but thought you&#39;d like to take a quickie bath while <br/>\nI&#39;m setting it up and getting us some snacks ready.  Then you won&#39;t <br/>\nhave to worry about bathing later.&#39;  Baths can be fun if you offer <br/>\ncool things like bubble bath, tub tints and new cheap toys from the <br/>\ndollar store.  I really don&#39;t think a child would elect to go 3 <br/>\nweeks without bathing or brushing teeth.  They can feel yucky too, <br/>\neven if they can last longer without a bath than most adults.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As long as they have a clear understanding that this is not<br/>\n&gt; healthy behavior and have chosen this path, am I to smile and be<br/>\n&gt; happy because they are making their own choices and that&#39;s a <br/>\n&gt; beautiful thing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Remember, be their active partner in helping them make good <br/>\nchoices.  Sometimes kids only see black or white choices.  We can <br/>\nhelp them see all the gray compromises.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Someone mentioned that quitting a softball team is not the same as <br/>\n&gt; quitting a play on opening night.

It is the team&#39;s <br/>\nproblem.  How well would a child play if they were being forced to <br/>\nstay?  I hated, hated, hated playing team sports when I was in high <br/>\nschool.  Did I mention I hated it??  I dressed out only the minimum <br/>\nrequired number of days to pass P.E.  The days I was forced to play <br/>\ndid not find me giving it my all.  Instead, I stood as far to the <br/>\nside or back and grumbled the entire time.  I didn&#39;t care if <br/>\nmy &quot;team&quot; was depending on me.  No one seemed to care how I felt, so <br/>\nwhy should I care how they felt?<br/>\n<br/>\nI worked for a man once who had a unique perspective on people who <br/>\nwanted to quit.  When they offered their 2-week resignation, he&#39;d <br/>\nthank them for being great employees, and encourage them to just <br/>\nleave and not come back.  He knew that time meant money.  He didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant any employees who were only watching the clock or the calendar <br/>\nbecause they wouldn&#39;t be putting all their energy into their jobs.  <br/>\nHe wasn&#39;t mean about it.  I thought it was very practical from a <br/>\nbusiness standpoint.  Not everyone would continue doing great work <br/>\nfor their last days when they know a final day is coming up.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As an adult, what if a mechanic had a car to fix the brakes but <br/>\n&gt; decided the lake was realling calling to him and he wanted to go <br/>\n&gt; fishing, so he closed up shop and went on his merry way.  The<br/>\n&gt; car&#39;s owner gets there and finds the place closed.  Oh, well, the<br/>\n&gt; shop owner made a choice - he didn&#39;t CHOOSE to finish working on<br/>\n&gt; the vehicle, and who are we to say that this was wrong?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This person is probably a mechanic because he really likes doing <br/>\nit.  He wants his business to succeed.  He won&#39;t make promises he <br/>\ncan&#39;t keep.  Perhaps instead he schedules one day when the shop is <br/>\nclosed so he can have a day of fishing.  My personal mechanic is not <br/>\navailable 7 days per week, nor does he have very long hours.  But <br/>\nhe&#39;s good and so we keep returning and even recommend him to <br/>\nothers.  That&#39;s just good business.  Now, if that person working <br/>\nwasn&#39;t the owner, maybe the owner would get really angry and fire <br/>\nthe person who shouldn&#39;t have closed early.  Sounds like this person <br/>\nneeds to find a different line of work that is more flexible so he <br/>\ncan spend time doing what he loves, fishing!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I mentioned cleaning up cat poop, children&#39;s vomit, making <br/>\n&gt; breakfast, lunch, supper, etc. in a previous post - that these<br/>\n&gt; are things I have to do sometimes, although I don&#39;t always want<br/>\n&gt; to, but I do it because it has to be be done as it affects my<br/>\n&gt; family, not just me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah... so if someone else volunteered to do these things instead, <br/>\nwould you feel relieved and pass the responsibilities on to that <br/>\nperson?  Are you looking for help?  Do you ask others to help out?  <br/>\nI don&#39;t mean to sound judgemental, but you&#39;re sounding like a <br/>\nmartyr.  Oh poor me, I have to do these awful chores because no one <br/>\nelse will.  Of course that may not be the case.  Perhaps another way <br/>\nto look at it is that you don&#39;t mind doing these things because you <br/>\nlove your family, your pets and your home.  I have to do things I <br/>\ndon&#39;t like either, such as cleaning cat pans and toilets, and <br/>\ncooking.  Which, BTW, I&#39;d rather clean toilets than cook.  But <br/>\nanyway, I know these things make my family happy (most of the time) <br/>\nso I do them because I want them to get done.  But I can find <br/>\ncompromises.  Buying the pre-soaped toilet scrubbies takes the yuck <br/>\npart out of that job.  Have easy to eat food accessible for the kids <br/>\nmeans less cooking for me.  I keep cut up fruit in the fridge.  If <br/>\nthey have to cut a cantaloupe, they may choose to eat a sugar cookie <br/>\ninstead.  But if I make it easy for them to grab the melon, they are <br/>\njust as likely to eat that.  My dd8 knows how to cook a scrambled <br/>\negg in the microwafe.  My ds9 can prepare his own bowl of cereal.  <br/>\nLunch items are also easy to have available.  Look for compromises, <br/>\nor ask here.  I&#39;m sure we can brainstorm some great ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our family believes that &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot; is not always a good<br/>\n&gt; enough reason when others will be hurt in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I understand this.  However, I think you should be aware that it can <br/>\nswing the other way.  I grew up believing that others didn&#39;t care <br/>\nhow I really felt and that it was my responsibility to keep them <br/>\nhappy regardless of how I felt inside.  As an adult and with the <br/>\nhelp of a therapist, I figured out that my mom taught me those <br/>\nthings when she was hurting from the divorce with my dad.  It took a <br/>\nlot of work and time to change how I felt because it was really my <br/>\nway of life.  I&#39;m trying to teach my children balance.  I don&#39;t want <br/>\nthem to hurt others, obviously.  I don&#39;t want them feeling hurt <br/>\neither.  I think each situation needs to be carefully thought out.  <br/>\nSometimes we have to do things we don&#39;t like, but not every single <br/>\ntime.  Sometimes, other people have to accept that I need to take <br/>\ncare of myself.  I want my children to understand that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; People talk about not placing labels on others, but it seems that <br/>\n&gt; during this discussion many are so concerned with their own label <br/>\n&gt; of &quot;unschooler&quot; and how pure an unschooler they are that it comes <br/>\n&gt; across as a somewhat elitest attitude (i.e. &quot;you&#39;re not a true <br/>\n&gt; unschooler&quot;).  If being an unschooler means never requiring an<br/>\n&gt; action from my children or never seeing that they follow through<br/>\n&gt; with a commitment, then please don&#39;t label me an unschooler.  <br/>\n&gt; Trudy Powell<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t answer for anyone else, but I&#39;d like to say that although I <br/>\nam an unschooler, I don&#39;t give a fig about what other people think.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t care for any label actually.  I also don&#39;t care if I&#39;m a <br/>\npure unschooler or not.  I know I&#39;m going to do things differently <br/>\nthan other people.  I want to live my life and raise my children the <br/>\nbest way I know how, not the best way someone else thinks.  Does <br/>\nthat make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s taken me a few years to change my way of thinking.  In fact, I <br/>\nstill have things I&#39;m working on.  I am really sorry if I ever come <br/>\nacross as an elitist or any other holier-than-thou attitude.  It&#39;s <br/>\njust that once I broke through the barriers I had set up for myself, <br/>\nI just realized how trivial they really were.  I did spend a brief <br/>\nperiod of time bemoaning all the lost time I&#39;ve wasted but then I <br/>\nrealized that sort of thinking wasn&#39;t doing anything positive for my <br/>\nfuture.  I sure wish I could have been uschooled.  I sure wish I <br/>\ncould change the way I&#39;ve treated my children in the past.  I sure <br/>\nwish I could .... but wishes aren&#39;t helpful.  Instead, I feel <br/>\nchallenged to improve myself, my parenting skills and my family.  <br/>\nI&#39;m living with them for today, not worried about our past nor <br/>\nstressed about our future.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t want to be called an unschooler, that&#39;s fine.  I <br/>\nbelieve you need to follow your heart and your gut.  The one piece <br/>\nof advice I have for you that I have learned on my unschooling <br/>\njourney thus far, is not to dismiss on the first shocking <br/>\nrevelation.  I got mad at unschoolers challenging me and would unsub <br/>\nfrom lists.  But their words sat in my heart and slowly I realized <br/>\nthey were right and that I just needed to change my way of <br/>\nthinking.  Again, that was baggage from my life that I had to work <br/>\nthrough.  It was difficult to realize there&#39;s a better way than what <br/>\nI was doing before.  I don&#39;t like admitting I&#39;m wrong.  My family <br/>\ntaught me that &#39;wrong&#39; was a weakness.  Now I believe that &#39;wrong&#39; <br/>\nis just part of life.  Live and learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, my mom and sister are in awe of me and all my changes.  They <br/>\nsay they don&#39;t understand it and could never do what I&#39;ve done.

I&#39;ll go ahead and meet each one of your statements, <br/>\nand then try to tie it all together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there&#39;s a big difference between choosing to play softball <br/>\nand riding your bike down a hill in the middle of the road. One is a <br/>\nsafety issue, and one is not. What we&#39;ve done in our house is <br/>\nfigured out why riding the bike down the hill in the middle of the <br/>\nroad was important. There&#39;s a reason, they aren&#39;t doing it just to <br/>\nmake you angry, or risk their lives. There&#39;s another factor. For our <br/>\nson, it was the only way to 1) get going as fast as he could, 2) roll <br/>\neasily with minimal work, and 3) there&#39;s a funny drop in your stomach <br/>\nwhen you top a hill. So we make it safe...we showed him how to look <br/>\nfor cars, we kept an eye out, we took his bike to the lake with <br/>\nlocked off roads, we took him to the local skate park.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the junk food, it&#39;s been said again, but I cannot emphasize how <br/>\nbig of a difference it makes when kids can choose and aren&#39;t fearful <br/>\nof the wait until they are &quot;allowed&quot; more junk. My kids have eaten a <br/>\nton of junk while recovering from my controlling habits. But they did <br/>\nget to the point where the junk isn&#39;t important. And they know they <br/>\ncan have it whenever so they eat what makes them feel good, whether <br/>\nits chocolate, fruit, veggies, water, soda. It&#39;s all the same to <br/>\nthem. Be sure to offer easy access fruits and veggies though. We use <br/>\na tupperware divided tray to keep stuff out all the time. I usually <br/>\nput it away about 4pm to help them wait for supper, although if <br/>\nsomeone is hungry I&#39;ll tell them to help themselves to a smallish <br/>\nsnack to help wait for supper.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind different sunscreen. There are reasons kids don&#39;t like <br/>\nsunscreen, maybe it takes too long while they are trying to go <br/>\noutside. Maybe they want to do it themselves. Maybe it smells bad, <br/>\nmaybe it feels slick and icky. Maybe they accidently rub it in their <br/>\neyes. Find alternatives. Provide light long screen tees. Get the <br/>\nsunscreen sticks. Get the aerosol spray, or the instant dry. Let them <br/>\ndo it themselves. As them to play in the shade (and make it appealing <br/>\nto do so)<br/>\n<br/>\nBrushing their teeth. The only times my kids have gone three weeks <br/>\nwithout brushing is when I was being forceful about it and it was a <br/>\npowerstruggle. The older ones pretty much do it on their own now, <br/>\nevery once in a while I&#39;ll notice the smell and ask &quot;have you <br/>\nconsidered brushing your teeth?&quot;, we&#39;ll laugh about it and they&#39;ll do <br/>\nit in an hour or two. There&#39;s nothing wrong about not bathing. It&#39;s <br/>\nactually pretty healthy not to scrub off your normal flora every <br/>\nday. ;-) When the scum starts sticking, it&#39;s uncomfortable to them <br/>\nand they ask for a bath. My two year old asks for a bath every time <br/>\nwe change his pull-up. It&#39;s not an issue for him, he baths when he <br/>\nfeels he needs to.<br/>\n<br/>\nsomeone else already mentioned the softball deal, but i did want to <br/>\nreiterate...you are saying that the ability of a softball team to <br/>\nplay is more important than the mental wellness of your child? If the <br/>\nteam is that low on players, then there are other issues. Or in a <br/>\nleague, it&#39;s better to drop out sooner so that the team members can <br/>\nbe absorbed into other teams. If they truly do not like softball, why <br/>\ndid they sign up? Because a parent or friend kept saying how much fun <br/>\nit would be, or to just try it? There are alternatives to that as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the email is all choices. I used to have a problem with <br/>\nthat. I used to be angry because I *had* to do dishes. I *had* to do <br/>\nlaundry. No, I don&#39;t. No one HAS to. The only thing you really *have* <br/>\nto do is breath, eat and poop. Everything else is choices. One might <br/>\nnot like the consequences on not doing it, or even not making a <br/>\nchoice, but the truth is that all is choice. and you can choose to be <br/>\nhappy. I&#39;m still practicing that part. You say the choices affect the <br/>\nfamily..but they apparently aren&#39;t as bothered by it? I choose to <br/>\nclean up a child&#39;s vomit because I don&#39;t like the smell. I also clean <br/>\nit up because when I&#39;m sick, I don&#39;t like cleaning up my own. I <br/>\nappreciate someone showing enough care to help make my world nicer. <br/>\nThe last time the little ones were sick, my seven year old woke up in <br/>\nthe middle of the night to my four year old throwing up. Without ever <br/>\nwaking me up, she took him to the bathroom, bathed him, helped him <br/>\nbrush his teeth, cleaned up the puke, and put him back to bed. I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know about it til the next morning. She didn&#39;t have to, but <br/>\nshe chose to because she&#39;d seen it modeled when she was sick a few <br/>\ndays before.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one is saying to not parent your child. What they are saying is to <br/>\nbe mindful, meaning that you carefully consider why you are telling <br/>\nyour children this or that. Often we make choices based on the tapes <br/>\nin our heads from childhood, the ones that our parents used like <br/>\n&quot;What will so-n-so think?&quot; or &quot;because i said so&quot;. When you stop to <br/>\nconsider why we say yes or no, it&#39;s usually very arbitrary reasons, <br/>\nand kids hear that. Once your children know that the BS is turned <br/>\noff, then when you say &quot;That&#39;s not safe&quot;, they listen. When you say, <br/>\n&quot;Let&#39;s try it this way instead,&quot; they listen. Children don&#39;t want to <br/>\nbe unsafe, they don&#39;t want to be hurt or sick. They just want to live <br/>\nand learn. &quot;When a person becomes a parent, he or she will not only <br/>\nlive through the experiences of the child, but will relive many of <br/>\nthe experiences of the old child he or she once was. Reliving is an <br/>\ninseparable part of parenting&quot; (Mr Rogers) The hardest part of <br/>\nparenting is separating yourself from your child and letting them <br/>\nexperience what they need to grow. It&#39;s letting go of the fear and <br/>\npain, and giving them the opportunity to grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo\">http://360.yahoo</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a>&gt; com/multimomma<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 15, 2006, at 9:12 AM, Trudy wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; During this discussion it seems as if some are suggesting that no<br/>\n&gt; matter what choice a child makes, you let them go with it so as to<br/>\n&gt; not quash their spirit or intimate to the child that their choice is<br/>\n&gt; unwise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If my 5-year-old daring son wants to ride his bike out in the road on<br/>\n&gt; a hill and I have explained why it&#39;s not wise and what could happen<br/>\n&gt; if he chooses to do so, do I let him anyway?

They don&#39;t enjoy putting sunscreen on before<br/>\n&gt; playing outside. Well, that&#39;s their choice - if they get a severe<br/>\n&gt; burn, then so be it, I should require that it be done, right? What<br/>\n&gt; if they have chosen to not brush their teeth for three weeks? What<br/>\n&gt; if they choose to not take a bath?

Why not? Many teams just have<br/>\n&gt; enough players to get the job done. What if my child is playing a<br/>\n&gt; crucial position and his absence would require the team to forfeit or<br/>\n&gt; not finish the season?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As an adult, what if a mechanic had a car to fix the brakes but<br/>\n&gt; decided the lake was realling calling to him and he wanted to go<br/>\n&gt; fishing, so he closed up shop and went on his merry way. The car&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; owner gets there and finds the place closed. Oh, well, the shop<br/>\n&gt; owner made a choice - he didn&#39;t CHOOSE to finish working on the<br/>\n&gt; vehicle, and who are we to say that this was wrong?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I mentioned cleaning up cat poop, children&#39;s vomit, making breakfast,<br/>\n&gt; lunch, supper, etc. in a previous post - that these are things I have<br/>\n&gt; to do sometimes, although I don&#39;t always want to, but I do it because<br/>\n&gt; it has to be be done as it affects my family, not just me. Someone<br/>\n&gt; said I don&#39;t have to do these things, I choose to do these things.<br/>\n&gt; Isn&#39;t that just a matter of semantics?

He closes up shop for the day, and when the vehicle <br/>\nowner arrives to get their vehicle, they are unable to do so. You <br/>\ncommented that if this were to happen, the way the mechanic would <br/>\nlearn from the experience would be that he would not get work from <br/>\nthat customer again, that customer would tell others who would not do <br/>\nbusiness there, and he could be turned in to the Better Business <br/>\nBureau for poor business practices.  You stated then &quot;he will know <br/>\nthat someone depends on him.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my point exactly.  The post that started this discussion had <br/>\nto do with whether or not a parent would allow their child to quit a <br/>\nteam sport, once started.  My original comment was that our family <br/>\nwould have to investigate the root cause of that child&#39;s desire to <br/>\nquit, but in lieu of something damaging (i.e. unfit coach or bullying <br/>\nby other kids, etc.) we would most likely have them continue to the <br/>\nend of the season, as being on a TEAM has an impact on others, not <br/>\njust themselves.  Some seemed to suggest that this was a bad example <br/>\nof unschooling as the child would be made to feel guilty if they had <br/>\nto continue and that having them do something they don&#39;t want to do <br/>\nis detrimental.  You asked me who I cared about the most, my child, <br/>\nor some team.  Are you saying that discussing with a child that <br/>\nothers&#39; have feelings and that one needs to strive to be dependable <br/>\nas our choices impact others is somehow imparting the message to my <br/>\nchild that I don&#39;t care about him/her?  I must admit, I do not see <br/>\nthe connection there at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou commented in your post that your children know that you will &quot;not <br/>\njudge them for choices&quot; they have made.  If this is the case, why <br/>\nwould the mechanic be judged for his choice?  Why would his choice to <br/>\ngo fishing receive such dire consequences?  Does he have to work on <br/>\nthe car if he doesn&#39;t choose to?  The customer should respect that <br/>\nthe mechanic did not want to work on the car that day, should they <br/>\nnot?  Are you saying that because he is an adult that he should know <br/>\nbetter?  Isn&#39;t this contradictory?  Why is there a double standard?  <br/>\nDo you respect the choices that only children make, but not the <br/>\nchoices of adults?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to another &quot;what-if&quot; scenario, you seemed to imply that I <br/>\nwas possibly keeping the application of sunscreen on my children from <br/>\nbeing an enjoyable or &quot;fun&quot; enough experience, and if they don&#39;t <br/>\nenjoy it or don&#39;t wish to have it applied that I should just let them <br/>\nget a sunburn and suffer the consequences (i.e. pain, fever, etc.).  <br/>\nIn this unschooling way, they will then come to understand why <br/>\nsunscreen is needed.  This seems a bit cruel and unusual to me and a <br/>\nvery poor parenting practice in general. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou also stated that there are times when you have family members who <br/>\nhave chosen to be &quot;dirty or stinky&quot;  (I had first asked about the <br/>\nadvisability of letting your child choose whether or not they brush <br/>\ntheir teeth or take a bath for weeks at a time).   You said, &quot;It&#39;s <br/>\nokay to point out they have dirty teeth, bad breath, and  a smelly <br/>\nbody.&quot;  Why have they chosen to be dirty or stinky if they have been <br/>\ntold/shown about the benefits of being clean (healthier, more <br/>\ncomfortable)?  Isn&#39;t the term &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;stinky&quot; a negative label <br/>\nthat should be avoided?  What one person perceives as dirty or stinky <br/>\nmay not be to someone else.  Do they experience guilt when they <br/>\ndiscover they smell bad?  Does it hurt them when they discover you <br/>\nthink that about them?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou commented that I was &quot;arguing against unschooling&quot;, but I&#39;m not <br/>\nclear on what you mean.  Are you saying that true unschooling - true <br/>\nfreedom - is the knowledge that I never HAVE to do anything, I only <br/>\nCHOOSE to do things?  You said I have been &quot;posting very unschooling <br/>\nideas and defending them.&quot;   So you&#39;re saying that because I have <br/>\nadvocated helping a child to see the needs of others beyond <br/>\nhimself/herself that this is a &quot;very unschooling idea&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, when it&#39;s all said and done in a few years (although loving <br/>\nyour children is never done), our goal is that our children will <br/>\nunderstand how wonderful  they are, what purpose they are here for, <br/>\nand that although they are extremely important and their opinions and <br/>\nlife truly valued, that it&#39;s not always only about  them  and that&#39;s <br/>\na great thing!

I&#39;ll go ahead and meet each one of your statements,  <br/>\nand then try to tie it all together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there&#39;s a big difference between choosing to play softball  <br/>\nand riding your bike down a hill in the middle of the road. One is a  <br/>\nsafety issue, and one is not.  What we&#39;ve done in our house is  <br/>\nfigured out why riding the bike down the hill in the middle of the  <br/>\nroad was important. There&#39;s a reason, they aren&#39;t doing it just to  <br/>\nmake you angry, or risk their lives. There&#39;s another factor. For our  <br/>\nson, it was the only way to 1) get going as fast as he could, 2) roll  <br/>\neasily with minimal work, and 3) there&#39;s a funny drop in your stomach  <br/>\nwhen you top a hill.  So we make it safe...we showed him how to look  <br/>\nfor cars, we kept an eye out, we took his bike to the lake with  <br/>\nlocked off roads, we took him to the local skate park.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the junk food, it&#39;s been said again, but I cannot emphasize how  <br/>\nbig of a difference it makes when kids can choose and aren&#39;t fearful  <br/>\nof the wait until they are &quot;allowed&quot; more junk. My kids have eaten a  <br/>\nton of junk while recovering from my controlling habits. But they did  <br/>\nget to the point where the junk isn&#39;t important. And they know they  <br/>\ncan have it whenever so they eat what makes them feel good, whether  <br/>\nits chocolate, fruit, veggies, water, soda. It&#39;s all the same to  <br/>\nthem. Be sure to offer easy access fruits and veggies though. We use  <br/>\na tupperware divided tray to keep stuff out all the time. I usually  <br/>\nput it away about 4pm to help them wait for supper, although if  <br/>\nsomeone is hungry I&#39;ll tell them to help themselves to a smallish  <br/>\nsnack to help wait for supper.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind different sunscreen. There are reasons kids don&#39;t like  <br/>\nsunscreen, maybe it takes too long while they are trying to go  <br/>\noutside. Maybe they want to do it themselves. Maybe it smells bad,  <br/>\nmaybe it feels slick and icky. Maybe they accidently rub it in their  <br/>\neyes. Find alternatives. Provide light long screen tees. Get the  <br/>\nsunscreen sticks. Get the aerosol spray, or the instant dry. Let them  <br/>\ndo it themselves. As them to play in the shade (and make it appealing  <br/>\nto do so)<br/>\n<br/>\nBrushing their teeth. The only times my kids have gone three weeks  <br/>\nwithout brushing is when I was being forceful about it and it was a  <br/>\npowerstruggle. The older ones pretty much do it on their own now,  <br/>\nevery once in a while I&#39;ll notice the smell and ask &quot;have you  <br/>\nconsidered brushing your teeth?&quot;, we&#39;ll laugh about it and they&#39;ll do  <br/>\nit in an hour or two. There&#39;s nothing wrong about not bathing. It&#39;s  <br/>\nactually pretty healthy not to scrub off your normal flora every  <br/>\nday. ;-) When the scum starts sticking, it&#39;s uncomfortable to them  <br/>\nand they ask for a bath. My two year old asks for a bath every time  <br/>\nwe change his pull-up.  It&#39;s not an issue for him, he baths when he  <br/>\nfeels he needs to.<br/>\n<br/>\nsomeone else already mentioned the softball deal, but i did want to  <br/>\nreiterate...you are saying that the ability of a softball team to  <br/>\nplay is more important than the mental wellness of your child? If the  <br/>\nteam is that low on players, then there are other issues. Or in a  <br/>\nleague, it&#39;s better to drop out sooner so that the team members can  <br/>\nbe absorbed into other teams. If they truly do not like softball, why  <br/>\ndid they sign up? Because a parent or friend kept saying how much fun  <br/>\nit would be, or to just try it?  There are alternatives to that as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the email is all choices. I used to have a problem with  <br/>\nthat. I used to be angry because I *had* to do dishes. I *had* to do  <br/>\nlaundry. No, I don&#39;t. No one HAS to. The only thing you really *have*  <br/>\nto do is breath, eat and poop. Everything else is choices. One might  <br/>\nnot like the consequences on not doing it, or even not making a  <br/>\nchoice, but the truth is that all is choice. and you can choose to be  <br/>\nhappy. I&#39;m still practicing that part. You say the choices affect the  <br/>\nfamily..but they apparently aren&#39;t as bothered by it? I choose to  <br/>\nclean up a child&#39;s vomit because I don&#39;t like the smell. I also clean  <br/>\nit up because when I&#39;m sick, I don&#39;t like cleaning up my own. I  <br/>\nappreciate someone showing enough care to help make my world nicer.  <br/>\nThe last time the little ones were sick, my seven year old woke up in  <br/>\nthe middle of the night to my four year old throwing up. Without ever  <br/>\nwaking me up, she took him to the bathroom, bathed him, helped him  <br/>\nbrush his teeth, cleaned up the puke, and put him back to bed. I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know about it til the next morning. She didn&#39;t have to, but  <br/>\nshe chose to because she&#39;d seen it modeled when she was sick a few  <br/>\ndays before.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one is saying to not parent your child. What they are saying is to  <br/>\nbe mindful, meaning that you carefully consider why you are telling  <br/>\nyour children this or that. Often we make choices based on the tapes  <br/>\nin our heads from childhood, the ones that our parents used like  <br/>\n&quot;What will so-n-so think?&quot; or &quot;because i said so&quot;. When you stop to  <br/>\nconsider why we say yes or no, it&#39;s usually very arbitrary reasons,  <br/>\nand kids hear that. Once your children know that the BS is turned  <br/>\noff, then when you say &quot;That&#39;s not safe&quot;, they listen. When you say,  <br/>\n&quot;Let&#39;s try it this way instead,&quot; they listen. Children don&#39;t want to  <br/>\nbe unsafe, they don&#39;t want to be hurt or sick. They just want to live  <br/>\nand learn. &quot;When a person becomes a parent, he or she will not only  <br/>\nlive through the experiences of the child, but will relive many of  <br/>\nthe experiences of the old child he or she once was. Reliving is an  <br/>\ninseparable part of parenting&quot; (Mr Rogers) The hardest part of  <br/>\nparenting is separating yourself from your child and letting them  <br/>\nexperience what they need to grow. It&#39;s letting go of the fear and  <br/>\npain, and giving them the opportunity to grow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 15, 2006, at 9:12 AM, Trudy wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; During this discussion it seems as if some are suggesting that no<br/>\n&gt; matter what choice a child makes, you let them go with it so as to<br/>\n&gt; not quash their spirit or intimate to the child that their choice is<br/>\n&gt; unwise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If my 5-year-old daring son wants to ride his bike out in the road on<br/>\n&gt; a hill and I have explained why it&#39;s not wise and what could happen<br/>\n&gt; if he chooses to do so, do I let him anyway?

That would be the consequences of the mechanic&#39;s actions and<br/>\nmost likely if he is an ethical shop owner he will know that someone<br/>\ndepends on him (as well as future business)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I mentioned cleaning up cat poop, children&#39;s vomit, making breakfast,<br/>\n&gt; lunch, supper, etc. in a previous post - that these are things I have<br/>\n&gt; to do sometimes, although I don&#39;t always want to, but I do it because<br/>\n&gt; it has to be be done as it affects my family, not just me.

You *can* leave them there and live with the smell<br/>\nof cat poop in your car.  You still CHOSE to clean it up because you<br/>\nCHOSE not to smell cat poop everytime you drove somwhere.
