Sometimes <br/>\ncertain messages don&#39;t wrap and it&#39;s easy to forget which message you <br/>\nread last, so YMMV. <br/>\n<br/>\nI realized last week that I have been spending too much time on the <br/>\ncomputer. Between a couple parenting lists, 3 u/s lists and reading <br/>\npolitical blogs...eek, it was too much. The kids seemed happy playing <br/>\nwithout me and watching tv, but they were starting to fight a little <br/>\nmore and I realized we had been reading almost no books lately. I&#39;d <br/>\nstarted to think &quot;if they are watching tv, I&#39;m free to be on the <br/>\ncomputer&quot; instead of sitting down with them or being available down <br/>\non the floor as soon as a show ended.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always feel rushed when posting if dd is awake, because she wants <br/>\nto play with the keyboard.

I am still working on this, and<br/>\nit has gotten a lot better since I started sending him some of the longer<br/>\nposts I have made. Recently he got onto two dads&#39; lists, and was remarking<br/>\nwith astonishment about the volume (35 posts in one WEEK - he thinks that&#39;s<br/>\na lot) and how the posts seem to draw him in and need lengthy and thoughtful<br/>\nresponses. Welcome to my world! <br/>\n<br/>\nI generally get my emailing done in disjointed snatches. I am on four busy<br/>\nlists that I receive mail on: Basics, U/D, AlwaysUnschooled and<br/>\nAlwaysLearning. In addition I am on my local group list, which is more along<br/>\nthe lines of announcements most of the time. Sometimes I mix up which list I<br/>\nam replying to, and this is not always a good thing. Most of the time I am<br/>\nsitting down to the computer when Jayn is busy or sleeping, and dh is out or<br/>\nsleeping. Of course it is way faster without distractions. Sometimes<br/>\nsomething will be preying on my mind and I can&#39;t sleep until I have replied<br/>\n- even if I don&#39;t immediately send the reply. Also I have a laptop and there<br/>\nare times when Jayn is playing next to me on the floor, or I can take my<br/>\ncomputer to be next to where she is working on computer or with her art<br/>\nstuff. These multitasking moments are rare and treasured.<br/>\n<br/>\nI make these lists the foundation of my parenting journey. They have made me<br/>\na better parent, and I find that the really time and energy consuming part<br/>\nis the thinking of replies rather than the actual reading. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the lists are very active, I tend to skim over the threads that are<br/>\nspecifically about teens, computer games or books older kids are reading.<br/>\nThere are individuals whose writing I would pause to read if they were<br/>\nwriting out their grocery list, regardless of topic, whose insights are<br/>\nvaluable no matter what. Rarely there are individuals who I usually skip<br/>\naltogether if experience has shown me a lack of simpatico. For these reasons<br/>\nI just can&#39;t imagine finding digests simpler, but as someone has mentioned,<br/>\nI&#39;m also on a cable modem, not a dial up or timed system.<br/>\n<br/>\nI move items that may require a reply to my follow up folder and do all my<br/>\nreplying after I have read most of the days&#39; posts, rather than merely<br/>\nreiterate what someone else may have already posted (unless I feel it is so<br/>\nimportant that an extra supportive voice is helpful) or conversely it&#39;s<br/>\nsomething really quick. When replying I think hard about whether I have the<br/>\ncredibility to speak to an issue. For example it is largely futile for me to<br/>\ntalk about teenagers or sibling issues, although if no-one is answering in a<br/>\ntimely manner I might refer to stories others have told in the past. I have<br/>\nlearnt that posting about my direct experiences in unambiguous language is<br/>\nthe best way to illustrate the principles of joyously living unschooling. I<br/>\ntry to ask myself &quot;will this help anyone?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past when I have had some kind of deadline, I have gone no-mail<br/>\ntemporarily. The topics really are cyclic. I wouldn&#39;t feel right doing that<br/>\nwith the list I am a co-owner on however!<br/>\n<br/>\nStill there are times when Jayn is calling me, and I am sometimes distracted<br/>\nand don&#39;t respond at once, sometimes momentarily frustrated that I am being<br/>\ncalled for &quot;again&quot;. However I think about Valerie and her great example, and<br/>\nam getting a lot better at just stopping and walking away from the computer<br/>\nor closing the lid for a while. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I&#39;m wondering how you balance reading these <br/>\nlists & interacting w/your children?  I&#39;ve already gone on the digest versions <br/>\nand pared down to just the bare bones, &#39;most valuable&#39; ones to me <br/>\n(ShineWithUnschooling, UnschoolingBasics, AlwaysUnschooled), but I am still not doing a <br/>\ngood job balancing reading/responding to them w/ my daughter needing time w/me. <br/>\n I think I&#39;m becoming addicted to you guys and these conversations!! : )<br/>\n<br/>\nEmma (5) told me yesterday that she wanted me to get off the computer, that <br/>\nit seems like I&#39;m ALWAYS on the computer lately and &quot;let&#39;s go play or DO <br/>\nsomething&quot;...so I shut it down and off we went!  Now, I have to say that we are <br/>\npretty active going out on field trips and exploring, etc....and while we&#39;re home, <br/>\nI play a LOT of barbies, my little pony, Polly pockets, and do crafts and <br/>\nwatch movies, etc.  But I have to agree with her and admit that these lists are <br/>\ntaking up WAY too much of my/her time.  It&#39;s just that I am getting SO much out <br/>\nof them and they (YOU) have been (and continue to be) so inspiring and <br/>\nhelpful in making our lives better/more joyful....except for the time reading them <br/>\nrequires :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow DO you do it?  Is it harder because Em is only 5?  Because she&#39;s an only <br/>\nchild and I am her sole playmate most of the time?  Do you set a timer for <br/>\nyourself/only allot a certain amount of time daily to the lists?  Go online only <br/>\nafter everyone else has gone to sleep at night?  Make it a point to only lurk <br/>\nand not respond?  I&#39;m afraid if I cannot figure out a workable system, I&#39;ll <br/>\nhave to unsubscribe or in the least, go on &#39;no mail&#39;...and I&#39;m just not ready to <br/>\ngive you all up just yet! : )<br/>\n<br/>\nHELP!<br/>\nDenise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3547,"nextTopicId":3886}}
