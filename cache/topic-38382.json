It will be a site that we can<br/>\nbuy ,sell, or trade items that we are done playing with, or the things are<br/>\nno longer exciting in our homes and it is time to pass them on. I know for<br/>\nus how much fun it is to find items that are &quot;new&quot; to us, and I also know<br/>\nthat we have many things that need new homes. I am thinking of charging a<br/>\nmembership fee, and then there will be a bulletin board where everyone can<br/>\nlist their items.  The other idea is to have a misc grab bag type option<br/>\nwhere a family could put three or four things together and it would be a<br/>\nsurprise to the family receiving the items. I would love to hear your<br/>\nfeedback on this idea so that I can &quot;tweak&quot; things before I launch it.
