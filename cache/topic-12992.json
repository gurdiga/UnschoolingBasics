As far as he&#39;s <br/>\nconcerned, grade levels don&#39;t exist when you &quot;homeschool&quot;. When <br/>\nwe&#39;ve been asked what grade he&#39;s in, we just say &quot;He&#39;s almost 8&quot; or <br/>\nwhatever his current age is and let them assume whatever they choose <br/>\nto assume. One time, a newish-acquaintance (who knew <br/>\nwe &quot;homeschooled&quot; but that&#39;s about it) asked him what his favorite <br/>\nsubject was. I paused, to give him time to answer if he wanted to, <br/>\nand I could see him thinking really hard. Then he got a big smile on <br/>\nhis face and he said &quot;Videogames!&quot; and wandered away. I thought it a <br/>\nwonderful answer. He got asked what grade he was in last Friday by a <br/>\nfriend we hadn&#39;t seen in a while who homeschooled her own kids for <br/>\nabout 9 years (the youngest is now in high school, the middle one is <br/>\nin college and the eldest is in the Air Force). He just said &quot;we <br/>\nhomeschool&quot;. Then she noticed our chalkboard (an 8&#39;x4&#39; section of <br/>\nkitchen wall - hard to miss lol!) He proceeded to point out stuff on <br/>\nit - the protein list, the multiplication table, etc (things he&#39;s <br/>\nasked to have available). So, she asked him what his favorite <br/>\nsubject was. He pondered and pondered and pondered and I said &quot;we <br/>\ndon&#39;t have subjects&quot;. So then she said &quot;Oh, you unschool?&quot; I said <br/>\nYup (hey, she knew the terminology - 1 point for her). Then, I could <br/>\ntell she was really trying, she said &quot;so what is your favorite thing <br/>\nyou&#39;ve been learning about? What do you like to do?&quot; he still <br/>\npondered and thought and didn&#39;t answer really. Later on, DH <br/>\nsaid &quot;Hmm could we be missing something here?&quot; (not that he&#39;s likely <br/>\nto do anything different - he&#39;s 100% sold on unschooling - but maybe <br/>\nwe&#39;ve gotten staganant, need to get out of a rut). I said that given <br/>\nthe context of &quot;subjects&quot; and all, I could see where it would be a <br/>\ntough one for DS to answer. While we were chatting (she&#39;s just <br/>\nstarted Mary Kay so she was doing a facial for me), DS was bopping <br/>\nin and out, watching what was happening, chatting about stuff he was <br/>\ndoing, in general being his usual exuberant, curious, verbal self. <br/>\nIf she didn&#39;t &#39;get&#39; that he loves Star Wars by the time she left, <br/>\nshe wasn&#39;t paying attention LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Pampered Chef Michelle","from":"&quot;Pampered Chef Michelle&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Social Lives of Two Year Olds","postDate":"1147436118","msgId":12994,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA1MTIwNTE1ajM0MGYxMmVlaDU2MTY0NjExZmJkYjQyM2VAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDMxYi4zYzAzNmZmLjMxOTVjYmVmQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDMxYi4zYzAzNmZmLjMxOTVjYmVmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":12992,"nextInTopic":12998,"prevInTime":12993,"nextInTime":12995,"topicId":12992,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But it portrayed a dad who had homeschooled his son<br/>\nand his son was one of these supposed &quot;super geniuses.&quot;  The kid was<br/>\nmiserable in his life.  All he wanted to do was play baseball.  All his<br/>\nfather wanted him to do was be &quot;the best&quot; literally.  Pushed him so hard and<br/>\nsucked all the joy out of life.  It was all or nothing.  I felt so sad for<br/>\nthis little boy.  If memory serves me correct he told his father that he<br/>\nwasn&#39;t going to get the psych evaluation he needed to get into some<br/>\nprestigious school (which was a lie) so the father killed the psych<br/>\nevaluator.  The boy was hoping that if he didn&#39;t get into this school he<br/>\ncould play baseball on Saturdays.  There was a &quot;happy&quot; part to the story in<br/>\nthat one of the other kids who had been in this same program and dropped out<br/>\nwas portrayed as a happy easy going and following his own dreams kid.  Must<br/>\nhave gotten ahold of the Teenage Liberation Handbook :)  But I see parents<br/>\nlike this all the time.  I run into other homeschooling families when we go<br/>\nout.

If they&#39;re asking they  <br/>\ndon&#39;t mean the same thing that a 6 yo does.<br/>\nSo true! I&#39;ve found that when other 2 year olds Moms say that their kids miss <br/>\ntheir friends or want to have a playdate it is usually the Mom&#39;s wishes or <br/>\njust the kids repeating what they&#39;ve heard from their moms or older siblings.  <br/>\nYou and your daughter have plenty of time to go to playgroups and make friends. <br/>\n Why rush things?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have found some playgroups to be like an unhealthy extension of <br/>\ndysfunctional high school where everyone is trying to out do each other with regard to <br/>\nparenting and their children&#39;s development.  Its like a contest.  It sounds like <br/>\nyou may be caught up in that.  There is no reason to compare your 2.5 year <br/>\nold to others or expect her to act a certain way because other people claim <br/>\ntheir little ones are doing something remarkable.  Revel in your daughter&#39;s <br/>\nuniqueness and follow her lead.  Trust her to know what she needs and wants and read <br/>\nher cues.  If you take the playgroup people out of the picture and stop <br/>\ncomparing her to other kids you will see that she is absolutely perfect in every <br/>\nway.  If your daughter read what you have written about her I think she be <br/>\ndevastated by what you&#39;ve said.  She has probably overheard you saying similar <br/>\nthings to your friends, family or spouse.  Consider her self esteem.  She won&#39;t <br/>\nfeel good about herself because she has a lot of friends and an active social <br/>\nlife at age 2 but what you think and say about her will deeply affect her self <br/>\nesteem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read a book 8-9 years ago about raising a gifted child (when I was trying <br/>\nto keep my 2 year old up to speed and I was caught up in the drama some new <br/>\nparents create for themselves) and one of the few things I remember from it is <br/>\nthat limiting contact with other children is very healthy for young, brilliant <br/>\nchildren.  It was worded something like: Preschool aged children should have <br/>\nlimited contact with outsiders.  I retained nothing else from that book so I <br/>\nguess that is all I needed to learn from it at the time.  It slowed us down back <br/>\nthen.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaygroups at that age aren&#39;t really for the children, they&#39;re for the Moms.  <br/>\nI learned that 9 years ago, too.  That&#39;s why they&#39;re usually called a Mom&#39;s <br/>\nclub and not a children&#39;s club.
