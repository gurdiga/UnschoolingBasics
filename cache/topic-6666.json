Now, most of the days we <br/>\ndo go out somewhere...fieldtrip, etc.  So some of the time, I would <br/>\nsay about 4 hours or so, is taken up with one of her activities.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re doing great as far as stretching yourselves and your <br/>\nprevious concepts of gaming etc.   My dd finished 6th grade in June, <br/>\nshortly thereafter discovered World of Warcraft (computer game with <br/>\nonline play, real time, previously she was playing Runecape, kinda <br/>\nthe same but likes WOW better).  We got her the game around the end <br/>\nof June and she has done the SAME thing as your dd, (she sleeps &#39;til <br/>\nnoon (give or take, &quot;until I&#39;m done sleeping&quot; as she puts it!)), then <br/>\nis on the game from the moment she gets up until she goes to bed at <br/>\nnight (except for food, bathroom etc...lol!).  I&#39;ve &quot;let&quot; her <br/>\n(because I too had the problem with it) do this all summer (and it&#39;s <br/>\npart of our deschooling process, I see healing, it&#39;s really working - <br/>\nshe says sometimes things like  &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re letting me do <br/>\nthis so much&quot; or &quot;thanks for getting me this game&quot; etc etc).  I do <br/>\nthe same thing as you sometimes, sit with her as she plays, asking <br/>\nquestions, or she&#39;ll come to me and say &quot;I want to show you something <br/>\nI found on WOW&quot; etc.  I&#39;m amazed at what she has accomplished in the <br/>\ngame (the levels she&#39;s attained etc etc) and the things she can tell <br/>\nme about it.   I &quot;worried&quot; that she was NEVER going to want to do <br/>\nanything else, but kept it to myself, posted here, emailed unschooler <br/>\nfriends, etc, ANYTHING but interfere with her absorption (and that&#39;s <br/>\nin the GOOD sense of the word!), TRUSTING that she will evolve on her <br/>\nown, in her own time, to other things etc etc.   Just this past week <br/>\n(so let&#39;s see, it&#39;s been almost 3 months she&#39;s been playing, except <br/>\nfor a couple of camping trips with no access to it) she&#39;s started to <br/>\nbranch off, take a break from it here and there.   She&#39;s still very <br/>\ninto the game, but she&#39;s not DONE with it, not that I mean she&#39;ll be <br/>\nDONE in the sense that she&#39;ll have had her fill and never play again, <br/>\nif that makes sense, and maybe DONE is the wrong word (I&#39;ll have to <br/>\nthink on what I mean to say about that for a while!).   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not working for the FIRST time ever (and had foot surgery in <br/>\nJune) so I planned all this to also be able to have time for recovery <br/>\nfrom the surgery and to do some &quot;deworking&quot; (!) myself (harder than I <br/>\nthought!).   We talk about her not being in school, what she thinks <br/>\nit will be like, etc etc, she&#39;s sometimes said &quot;I wonder when I&#39;ll <br/>\nwant to do something different&quot; and I&#39;ve said &quot;You&#39;ll just know&quot; - <br/>\nshe&#39;s still got a lot of programming in her thought process because <br/>\nof school that will take time to erase (and it will vary from child <br/>\nto child).   I also told her that come fall, and when the local <br/>\nhomeschooling group starts doing things, I want to go meet some of <br/>\nthe people I&#39;ve only emailed or talked to on the phone, maybe go to <br/>\nan event they plan that appeals to us or her, do some things (now <br/>\nthat my foot is better, I was unable to walk a lot before from an <br/>\ninjury) during the beautiful New England fall weather (our favorite <br/>\nseason!) and she agreed.   So we do get out for a few hours here and <br/>\nthere, volunteering right now a few times to help someone who&#39;s <br/>\nfostering cats and kittens for local shelters in socializing them, so <br/>\nthey get used to many different people and will be more adoptable <br/>\n(most were ferral moms with kittens etc).   And we&#39;re meeting more <br/>\nand more UNSCHOOLERS, at first it seemed like there weren&#39;t any <br/>\nnearby but that&#39;s changing (we&#39;re the only ones in our town that I <br/>\nknow of).<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to trust the process, but she will move on.  I haven&#39;t seen <br/>\nmuch of it YET (except for the little moments I wrote above) but I <br/>\nTRUST that it will happen as she recovers from being told what to do <br/>\nwhen because of school, when she knows that I won&#39;t MAKE her <br/>\ndo &quot;schooly&quot; stuff, as I continue to treat her with respect, listen <br/>\nto her opinions, discuss issues with her, really try to see her point <br/>\nof view and not just tell her how I think she SHOULD feel, or how she <br/>\nshould handle something that comes up with a friend etc (oh yeah, she <br/>\ndoes talk on the phone with friends sometimes too!) etc etc.   <br/>\nChildren learn to be respectful (and therefore, sometimes, more <br/>\nwilling to do something along with you that YOU are interested in <br/>\nthat involves leaving the house) when you treat them with respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re doing great.  Keep reading!   I need my daily maintenance <br/>\ndose!
