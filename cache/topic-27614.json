The format allows for a<br/>\nlot of creative flow!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be games and crafts and bag ice cream and round table<br/>\ndiscussions and lotsa time to just chat too.  Come on out for a great<br/>\ntime and the chance to meet with other unschooling (or unschooling<br/>\ninterested) families.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor everyone that is planning to attend the ARGH unschooling<br/>\ngathering, here are the details about where to meet: <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Friday night potluck, we are at the Kiwanis Rec. Center on<br/>\nMarket Street. From the Sleep Inn in Johnson City (near I-26), you<br/>\nwill just go back out to State of Franklin, head south and you will<br/>\ncome to the intersection of Market street (11E) where the rec center<br/>\nis on.  Take a left onto Market and it&#39;s just a little ways up on your<br/>\nright.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen heading out for Saturday&#39;s activities, turn right onto 11E/Market<br/>\nstreet from State of Franklin and head West towards Jonesborough. You<br/>\nwill pass the new Wal-Mart and go about 3 miles (roughly). You&#39;ll see<br/>\nthe sign for Trinity Baptist on your right, but you&#39;ll go past it to<br/>\nthe next intersection which is Headtown Road. Take a right on Headtown<br/>\nand go a short distance to the church driveway. It will be marked with<br/>\nanother Trinity Baptist sign on your right. As you face the church,<br/>\nyou can enter by the main doors, or there is a set of doors to your<br/>\nright which is near the rooms we will be using all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee you there!!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nMap to Kiwanis Rec Center (717 W.

For more information on Barcamps, check this website: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://barcamp.org/\">http://barcamp.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHow the Schedule Works<br/>\nARGH has no strict format. The actual schedule will be determined as a<br/>\ngroup on Saturday morning based on the number of, and interest in, the<br/>\nproposed sessions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEvent details<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen:  Friday November 23rd and Saturday November 24th.<br/>\nWhere:  Locations to be announced soon! <br/>\nCost:  Requested donation of $10 per family to cover space rental<br/>\ncosts and help cover some of Steve and Eli&#39;s travel costs.  If your<br/>\nfamily can help out with a bit more, that is great. If you truly can&#39;t<br/>\nafford it, please come anyway!! All are welcome regardless of<br/>\nfinancial situations. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchedule:<br/>\n<br/>\nFriday<br/>\n<br/>\n~Potluck and drum circle 5pm-8pm<br/>\n<br/>\n~For anyone wanting to stay up later and hear some live music,<br/>\nCristabel and the Jons will be playing in downtown Johnson City at<br/>\nAcoustic Coffeehouse at 10pm. You can hear some of their music at<br/>\nmyspace:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.myspace.com/christabelmusic\">http://www.myspace.com/christabelmusic</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAcoustic Coffeehouse has food (including some veggie choices), great<br/>\nbeer, smoothies and more for those that want to hang out for a while.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a diverse and family friendly environment. Cristabel plays a lot<br/>\nof old standards and swing style music, great fun for dancing!<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday <br/>\n<br/>\nThis will be loosely structured in the bar camp style. We will post<br/>\nall possible topics and everyone will decide which they&#39;d like to<br/>\nattend. We&#39;ll split up into various areas with a very open format that<br/>\ngives everyone input and allows for a lot of flow. The main idea is to<br/>\nhave fun, learn and share while building connections with other<br/>\nunschoolers (and those interested in unschooling) in our region.<br/>\n<br/>\nProposed Sessions <br/>\n\t&quot;Winging It Around the World: Assorted Nuts and Bolts of World<br/>\nTravel&quot; (Eli)<br/>\n\t&quot;Self-Educated = Self-Employed: Entrepreneurism 101&quot; (Steve/Eli)<br/>\n\tGrown Unschooler Panel (if you have a teen/young adult unschooler<br/>\nthat might like to participate, please let me       <br/>\n        know!)<br/>\n\t&quot;The case for creativity&quot; (Ren)<br/>\n         &quot;The Zen of Unschooling&quot; (Ren)<br/>\n\t&quot;Creating Community: A Structured Conversation&quot; (Steve)<br/>\n\tOngoing ATC funshop<br/>\n        Cob building and sustainable communities workshop (Katherine)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease add your ideas here. Any passion or interest you&#39;d like to<br/>\nshare with others, is most welcome as a possible topic.  Think of<br/>\ntopics you might like to see discussed also.  There just might be<br/>\nsomeone willing to facilitate such a discussion!:)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPlanners<br/>\n\tRen Allen, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> <br/>\n\tEli Gerzon, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:egwizard@...\">egwizard@...</a> <br/>\n\tSteve Cooperman, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stevecooperman@...\">stevecooperman@...</a><br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease email me to be added to the participants list.<br/>\nWalk-ups are also welcome, but we need some idea of how many to expect<br/>\nin order to better plan. Thank you!!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTask List/items to bring:<br/>\n<br/>\n~Anyone willing to bring a couple items to share for the toddler<br/>\ncorner (open to any and all ages, the idea is to have items that are<br/>\nsafe for little ones for ongoing play) let me know.<br/>\nI will have large legos and brio train track in abundance. Bring<br/>\nanything other than those items. Once a person offers to bring an<br/>\nitem(s) we won&#39;t have anyone else bring that so it&#39;s easier to sort<br/>\nout when the day is over.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Any art supplies you might enjoy using for ATC&#39;s.  More information<br/>\ncan be found about artist trading cards here: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cedarseed.com/air/atc.html\">http://www.cedarseed.com/air/atc.html</a><br/>\nI will have plenty of blank ATC&#39;s for you and your family to create<br/>\nwith.  Bring some extra scissors (might want to mark with your name)<br/>\nglue sticks, stickers, funky papers, embellishments, stamps etc...<br/>\nanything you would enjoy using. There will be art materials available<br/>\nfor everyone to use also.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sack Lunch for Saturday lunch break.  Once a location is secured, I<br/>\nwill post a list of nearby restaurants and delivery for those that<br/>\nprefer this option. I am hoping to have a location that will have a<br/>\nkitchen available for us.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n**Note: If you&#39;re traveling from out of town and plan to stay<br/>\novernight, please let me know right away so I can secure a discount<br/>\nfor everyone. Sleep Inn has promised a $62.99 price if I book a<br/>\ncertain number of rooms for our group. Their usual rate is $84.99. <br/>\nThey are located near the freeway, lots of restaurants, Barnes and<br/>\nNoble etc.... If you need other options please let me know that also.<br/>\nIt would be nice to have a single hotel so folks can connect with each<br/>\nother more easily when coming from other areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso: If anyone wants to stay around for Sunday to just hang out and<br/>\nwalk downtown Jonesborough (or go to a park, or???) that is an option<br/>\ntoo!  My family will certainly be available for more fun.:)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;Let the beauty of what you love be what you do.&quot;  ~Rumi<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://learninginfreedom.com\">http://learninginfreedom.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://radicalunschooling.blogspot.com/\">http://radicalunschooling.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27750,"nextTopicId":27877}}
