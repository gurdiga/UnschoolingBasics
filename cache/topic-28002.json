Anyone have experience with having a second language at  <br/>\nhome?<br/>\n--Adrean&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWe did have a family live in an apartment on our property that spoke  German <br/>\nas their primary language.  We were really close to them, and their  <br/>\nphilosophy was that in front of our family they would speak English, even to  each <br/>\nother.  I asked the mom about that and she said it was a courtesy that  in an <br/>\nEnglish speaking household they would not speak German.  I think so  no one would <br/>\nbe &quot;out of the loop&quot; and not know what they were saying even if it  was <br/>\nbetween them.  I can think of a couple of instances where this went out  the window <br/>\nthough, one was with their youngest.  The little girl was  just not as fluent <br/>\nspeaking English, so the mom would occasionally speak German  to her in front <br/>\nof me to communicate with her.  Second was when they  needed to talk fast, <br/>\nlike an emergency with the kids...she saw them running and  could see something <br/>\ndangerous the kids couldn&#39;t see... also when the kids  were arguing with each <br/>\nother.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt was like they needed to communicate fast so  they reverted to  their <br/>\nnative language, a language that they were more comfortable  speaking.  It worked <br/>\nOK when the mom was there, she could understand them  and help out.  A little <br/>\nmore difficult when I was watching the children  myself, LOL.  I tried to be <br/>\nthere, and when things were escalating I would  step in, calm them down a bit <br/>\nand ask them to take their time and talk in  English so I could help out.  I <br/>\ntold them they had all the time they needed  to explain to me and each other what <br/>\nthey were wanting and where the problem  arose etc, and we could take our <br/>\ntime, working together, to figure out a  solution.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nIt could be that the children can communicate faster in  English than with <br/>\nsigning so when they are arguing that is more comfortable for  them.  You said <br/>\nit was when you were driving.  I have pulled over  somewhere when my boys <br/>\nneeded help, language isn&#39;t an issue with us, but I feel  I need to give them my <br/>\nfull attention when they are having trouble resolving an  issue, so I pulled <br/>\nover.  Maybe if you can see that they are having a  problem you could pull the <br/>\ncar over and ask them to calm down for a minute and  to take their time and sign <br/>\nit out so you can help them.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have asked them respectfully to sign  without voicing so my job would <br/>\n </span></blockquote>be easier, but they continue to ignore me. &quot;I  forgot,&quot; &quot;it&#39;s a habit,&quot; <br/>\netc.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIf it were me I would put up a BIG sign in my home to  &quot;remind&quot; them.  It is <br/>\nyour home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPam  G<br/>\n<br/>\nOur Blogs:<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/_\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/)\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/_\">http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/)\">http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************Check out AOL&#39;s list of 2007&#39;s hottest <br/>\nproducts.<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)\">http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27952,"nextTopicId":27387}}
