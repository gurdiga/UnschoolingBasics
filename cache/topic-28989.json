I don&#39;t remember what insightful things I wanted to say anymore. So I&#39;ll try this. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt seems you are setting up a dichotomy between your needs and your daughters&#39; needs. I think if you can address that first you won&#39;t feel quite so torn up over not having them go to sleep when you want them to. I can remember very clearly lying in bed with Simon when he was 2 and a bit and listening to David playing Tokyo Extreme Racer on the Sega and wanting more than anything to get &quot;my time&quot; and how it wasn&#39;t fair that I had to lie in bed with this not really sleepy boy while David got to play and I&#39;d probably fall asleep and then I wouldn&#39;t get any time to myself. It made me resentful all over. It made me angry with Simon and with David and angry with myself for falling asleep.  When I stopped thinking about how awful it was and how much I was missing, lying in bed with Simon, holding his little chubby hands, talking and reading stories, all of those things became a pleasure. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have bedtimes anymore, my memory is vague, but I think they went out the window when Simon was 4 and Linnaea was a year old. That said, David dictates when we go to bed. We all sleep in the same room, well, sometimes Simon sleeps in a different room, but if Linnaea or Simon wants to snuggle up and listen to a story or watch a DVD with David and me than it is important to go to bed before David falls asleep. Sometimes David will sleep in another room if he has to get up early, or Simon and Linnaea and I will cuddle up somewhere else, it isn&#39;t writ in stone, it is flexible and adaptable and ever changing. I don&#39;t feel frustrated about it anymore. I don&#39;t feel angry or resentful or left out.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Linnaea got upset because Simon and David wanted to go to sleep but she wanted to keep reading book one in the Warrior Cats series. It wasn&#39;t an easy moment. It was a moment where she couldn&#39;t see a way out and she didn&#39;t say what she wanted for a long time. As soon as I figured out what it was she wanted we bundled off downstairs, pillows in hand and snuggled up to read the book in a different bed. I could have stayed angry, I could have decided that we&#39;d read 3 chapters and that was fine, I could have embraced all the negative that was potential in that moment, in last night&#39;s bedtime issues, but instead I chose to go downstairs with her. And it was brilliant. I got to read to Linnaea from this book that she is loving and we talked about all the characters and what we think is going to happen next. I could have missed that by making her shut up and go to sleep. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is brief the point where they need you so much. I can remember a point when I was growing tired of nursing and I bought a book called Mothering your Nursing Toddler. I didn&#39;t read very much of it, but something clicked when I held the book in my hands, something that said do I want to still nurse Simon or stop. And I didn&#39;t want to stop. As soon as I decided that I didn&#39;t mind it anymore. And now I don&#39;t have a nursing toddler. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Jodi Bezzola &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jodibezzola@...\">jodibezzola@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, 26 January, 2008 3:29:52 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: More parenting advice please!<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Kelly, I&#39;m going to actually answer some of your questions because maybe it will help clarify things for me even more.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  ~~How long does the bedtime ritual take? How long from the time you say <br/>\n&quot;bedtime&quot; to the time they actually go to sleep?<br/>\n  <br/>\n  It takes over an hour for sure, probably closer to an hour and a half.  They love their bath so they usually hang out there for quite awhile, then pjs, then a bottle while we cuddle, read books, watch something.   They get wound down, are rubbing their eyes, yawning (by now they&#39;ve been up over 12 hours and are showing lots of signs of being ready to sleep), so then I ask if they want to go to bed and they either say &#39;not yet&#39; or some version of that, or, &#39;wanna sleep in my bed&#39; or some version of that.  That&#39;s when we carry them to bed, my husband or I lay down with them (whoever they ask for) and that&#39;s when the fun starts.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~What time do you and your husband go to bed? What do you do between the <br/>\ngirls&#39; bedtime and your own? What do you do between the time the girls <br/>\nare actually *asleep* and the time you go to bed?<br/>\n  <br/>\n  I go to bed around 10, my husband a little later.  I go to yoga early in the mornings (it&#39;s the only time I&#39;m alone and I&#39;m a pretty crazy mom without it!), so if I&#39;m not asleep by that time I&#39;m really tired in the morning because I&#39;m up at 5 to make it work before my husband goes to work.  Between their bedtime and mine I get a chance to check/write emails, put the chaos of toys and stuff away, clean the kitchen, finish laundry, watch tv, actually have the luxury to read a book or talk to a friend on the phone, you get the picture.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  ~~How do you think that time could be better spent? Do you enjoy the ritual you&#39;ve set up? Do the girls? What do *you* think are your options?<br/>\n  <br/>\n  If you mean how could the time after they go to sleep be better spent I don&#39;t think it could be!  If you mean the bedtime ritual with the girls, I don&#39;t really think it could be better spent either because they enjoy it, it seems to be what they want, and they aren&#39;t asking to do anything else or expressing dislike with the ritual.<br/>\n  I don&#39;t necessarily totally enjoy much about the evening routine.  By that time I&#39;ve spent 12+ hours with very intense twins who are in conflict with each other much of the day and make it very challenging to get out the door to do anything at all outside the house.  I&#39;m quite interested in the day being done by that point.  I&#39;m human!  I don&#39;t see alot of options right now which is the main reason I&#39;m asking for help!<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Does the sun come up on their side of the house? Can you put up dark, <br/>\ndark shades in the girls&#39; room to keep them down past 7:00am?<br/>\n  <br/>\n  The sun doesn&#39;t come up on their side of the house, plus we have a pull-down blackout blind on their window.  They wake up in the pitch dark every day ready to move!<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Can you live without a &quot;bedtime&quot;? You could still have a routine to get <br/>\nready for bed, but them everyone could gather in bed together and read <br/>\nor talk or watch a movie. Let the girls fall asleep while watching a <br/>\nmovie in your arms. Then carry them to bed. Why the need for bedtime?<br/>\n  <br/>\n  I guess because I still need to have a life of some kind so I know who I am other than being a mom...I was my own person for 37 years before I had the girls and I feel like I&#39;m rapidly losing myself.  I don&#39;t work outside the home, and it&#39;s SO all about them that I struggle with resentment if I don&#39;t at least get a chance to read a chapter in a book and go to yoga every day!  How do other unschoolers handle this aspect when their kids are up/down at all hours??  Is there never to be a quiet hour in the house for me to just be me?<br/>\n  And what you describe above is exactly what we do, and I think I described it above that they ask to go to bed and then it&#39;s after they&#39;re tucked in that they start the &#39;I need something&#39; or some version of that.  Frustrating, because I can plainly see that they are so tired but they won&#39;t stop moving!!<br/>\n<br/>\n~~How could you better spend your time each evening that wouldn&#39;t be a <br/>\nnightly struggle?<br/>\n  <br/>\n  I don&#39;t know, can you tell me? :o)))  I get teased every evening that they&#39;re so tired they&#39;re actually going to sleep, and then...they&#39;re up again...and again...and again...it&#39;s really really challenging to not get frustrated because I feel like by this point I have absolutely no patience left at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Just because bedtime has worked since they were little doesn&#39;t mean it <br/>\ncan still work. You may need to think outside your box. How could you <br/>\nbetter spend that hour or two?<br/>\n  <br/>\n  I totally get that things get different quickly and all the time when there are little ones in the house.  See above answer! :o)<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Thanks for listening,<br/>\n  Jodi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n          -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jodi Bezzola &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jodibezzola@...\">jodibezzola@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI do make sure and ask them to gather what they want before we tuck in, <br/>\nand we<br/>\nusually do a tour together so they can peruse their collection of stuff <br/>\nand<br/>\ngather what they want. It doesn&#39;t really make sense for bedtime to be <br/>\nlater -<br/>\nthey wake around 7 no matter what time they go to bed and are very <br/>\ntired by 8<br/>\np.m. - they don&#39;t stop moving all day and we always run around outside <br/>\nfor a<br/>\nnature walk or park play of some kind too. So...it also doesn&#39;t work <br/>\nfor them<br/>\nto stay up after we go to bed since at 3 yrs they are quite destructive <br/>\nand very<br/>\nmuch get into things kids and I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep wondering <br/>\nwhat they<br/>\nwere getting into next and not knowing for sure if they were safe or <br/>\nnot without<br/>\nsomeone checking in on them. If they would ever sleep in it wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nbe such a<br/>\nbig deal, but man, are they owly when they don&#39;t get the sleep they <br/>\nneed! And<br/>\nat 3 do little people really know how to fix sleep deprivation?? <br/>\nSometimes<br/>\nduring the day they say they are tired, but<br/>\nwill never just sit/lie down to rest or have a nap.

I will be honest, I felt quite invalidated in some of the response.  I too had a mother who did that, and she totally collapsed when she was 41 which is the age I am now, and that is scary.  I&#39;m not just grousing, I&#39;m looking for a way to balance ALL of us in the family, getting ALL our needs met - isn&#39;t that what I&#39;ve heard unschoolers say that it is possible for everyone to get what they want?  I&#39;m so happy to hear you say that you need alone time - I&#39;m the same way.  When I&#39;m around others constantly I get cloudy even about whether or not I&#39;m hungry, and my patience, my joy, my everything needs to be recharged.  Thank you for confirming that is okay.  It&#39;s so easy to say &#39;don&#39;t be resentful be thankful&#39;, *and* it takes me a little time and space at least to be able to even be willing to see it that way.  This is simply the way I&#39;m wired!  Do I wish I was more like my husband a true extrovert who only needs space and time once every<br/>\n other month?  Yes!!  But I&#39;m not, and I&#39;m just honestly trying to find my way, find how to bring ALL of me to the table since I&#39;m so busy honoring the girls bringing ALL of themselves too.

I had my first child at 28. That doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean that I need to now look at my life from that point forward as a <br/>\nmom only (just because I had 28 years to be anything I wanted). I <br/>\nam many things. And EACH of those aspects of myself deserve to <br/>\nshine--not just the mom part. This is about balance. Just because <br/>\nwe have kids doesn&#39;t mean we give up who we are, or what are own <br/>\nneeds are. I think that is dangerous. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a mother who did that--and who still does that. And what it <br/>\nmodeled for me (as her child) is that when you grow up, you have no <br/>\nvalue. My mother never valued herself enough to say, I need <br/>\n______. It took me until adulthood to realize that we all (no <br/>\nmatter our age, race or parental status) have the right to say I <br/>\nneed ______, and then give ourselves that need. We all--children <br/>\nAND parents have the right to value ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 4 (soon to be 5) children, all of whom I adore. But I also <br/>\nadore who I am. One of the many things I am is an introvert. That <br/>\nmeans I NEED a certain amount of alone time to recharge my personal <br/>\nenergy. Otherwise, I find I don&#39;t have patience, I don&#39;t have joy, <br/>\nand I certainly am NOT a good mom. Now with 4 children, I take that <br/>\nalone time where I can get it. As the boys have gotten older, I <br/>\nfind that I can take that time during the day as my youngest naps <br/>\nand the older boys are playing outside, or with their DS/Game cube, <br/>\nor playing a game, or what have you. But when they were younger, <br/>\nthe only time I had to myself was when they went to bed. No, I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have them watch TV with me, or fold laundry with me, or do <br/>\nanything else with me. I needed to be alone. And that is OKAY. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it *all* about me? No, not all. It is about me, *too*. It is <br/>\nabout the kids, and about my husband, and about me. We are a family-<br/>\n-so it is about all of our needs. And that works for us. I see <br/>\nJodi saying that something that used to work for her family is no <br/>\nlonger working for her family, and hey, does anyone have any ideas <br/>\nabout things she can to do honor her children&#39;s needs AND her <br/>\nneeds. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of ways to do that.

I&#39;ve been feeling a bit nostalgic lately as I realize that I could  have <br/>\nmet my needs and my children&#39;s in much different ways when they were  young.  <br/>\nI&#39;m also very aware of how quickly a child can be lost.  I  think many of us on <br/>\nthis list are so cognizant of that possibility that we use  it as a guidepost <br/>\nwhen we do find ourselves impatient with our kids.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m an introvert also and am at my best when I have lots of quiet time for  <br/>\nreflection and just to be alone.<br/>\nI was a single mom for several years and that time alone was not easy to  <br/>\ncome by, however, I do remember some things that worked and might be something  <br/>\nto try.....So on a practical and not so nostalgic note, I have a couple of  <br/>\nideas....<br/>\n <br/>\nI got a baby jogger (I&#39;ve seen them for twins also).  I took the kids  out <br/>\nfor a run or walk most every day and usually they would fall asleep after  the <br/>\nfirst mile.  I always felt better for getting the exercise, the kids  were with <br/>\nme and I usually had at least 30 minutes of pure quiet.  When  Brenna was 3 <br/>\n1/2, Logan was born so there was a time span until she could ride  her bike <br/>\nwhen this wasn&#39;t practical but I do remember Logan being very happy for  several <br/>\nyears in the jogger and Brenna riding her bike beside me.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe kids slept with me quite a bit during the &quot;single mom&quot; years.  I  was <br/>\nstill big into bedtimes and rules but those times when they were in the bed  with <br/>\nme are some of my best and most peaceful memories.  We would all  cuddle in <br/>\nbed, read books and I&#39;d sing and tell them stories.  When they  fell asleep, <br/>\nI&#39;d usually get up and do things I wanted or needed to  do. I didn&#39;t get as much <br/>\nsleep as I do now but I did have the quiet time I  needed. (On a side note, <br/>\none of those nights I got up and was on the  computer,  I got an IM from a most <br/>\nwonderful man who later became  my husband)<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know if these are ideas that would be helpful for you.  There  are so <br/>\nmany creative ways (that may be outside mainstream thinking) that might  be <br/>\nworth a try.  I often see ideas on these lists that are just amazing and  never <br/>\ncrossed my mind because of my preconceived ideas about what parenting  should <br/>\nlook like.  <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nGail<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Biggest Grammy Award surprises of all time on AOL Music.     <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://music.aol.com/grammys/pictures/never-won-a-grammy?NCID=aolcmp003000000025\">http://music.aol.com/grammys/pictures/never-won-a-grammy?NCID=aolcmp003000000025</a><br/>\n48)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: More parenting advice please!","postDate":"1201374135","msgId":29018,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQTJFNjUxOTk0MzkyMC0xNEYwLTNGMjFAd2VibWFpbC1kZDAzLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZuZm9taisyZjU5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":29011,"nextInTopic":29019,"prevInTime":29017,"nextInTime":29019,"topicId":28989,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Sometimes it&#39;s hard to look at <br/>\nother options when we&#39;re too wrapped up in what&#39;s happening to us <br/>\npersonally.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI had my first child at 28.  That doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmean that I need to now look at my life from that point forward as a<br/>\nmom only (just because I had 28 years to be anything I wanted).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI had my first at 27 and my second at 36. My age did not change the <br/>\nfact that I was, indeed, a mom from that birth point on. It wasn&#39;t that <br/>\nI was *only* a mom. It was that I was *now* a mom. And that&#39;s a big <br/>\nrole to take on. And there aren&#39;t many options for &quot;not motherhood.&quot; <br/>\nShe could just leave, put the kids up for adoption, sell them on the <br/>\nsex slave market---but I doubt any of those were among her first <br/>\nchoices. &lt;g&gt; Once a mother, you&#39;re kind of always a mother. It&#39;s not <br/>\nlike selling the horse when you&#39;re overwhelmed with the horse and its <br/>\nmany responsibilities. It&#39;s a permanent gig. Not the *only* gig, but <br/>\none that&#39;s not going away.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut she said that she was missing Who She Was before kids---that she <br/>\nliked having what she had at 37 and that the adjustment was hard. She <br/>\nbrought up the person she was before and the person she&#39;s struggling <br/>\nwith now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really helps to change the way we look at What I Have Now and work <br/>\nwithin that paradigm instead of Wanting What WAS and trying to achieve <br/>\nthat. Motherhood ain&#39;t going away.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am many things.  And EACH of those aspects of myself deserve to<br/>\nshine--not just the mom part.  This is about balance.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, it&#39;s about meeting small children&#39;s needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just because we have kids doesn&#39;t mean we give up who we are, or what <br/>\nare own<br/>\nneeds are.  I think that is dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one said that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt IS important though to understand what ALL we are and work within <br/>\nthat. Trying to get rid of children so we can have &quot;me&quot; time isn&#39;t the <br/>\nsame as finding what works for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf what I want isn&#39;t working, it&#39;s good for me to look again at what <br/>\nmight work best for everyone and see how best to meet all those needs. <br/>\nObviously the girls&#39; needs aren&#39;t being met---and the struggle to meet <br/>\n*mom&#39;s* needs isn&#39;t being met *either* because no one is ending up <br/>\ncontent.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a mother who did that--and who still does that.  And what it<br/>\nmodeled for me (as her child) is that when you grow up, you have no<br/>\nvalue.  My mother never valued herself enough to say, I need<br/>\n______.  It took me until adulthood to realize that we all (no<br/>\nmatter our age, race or parental status) have the right to say I<br/>\nneed ______, and then give ourselves that need.  We all--children<br/>\nAND parents have the right to value ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you&#39;re saying that the moms (and a few dads) here have no value <br/>\nbecause we work to meet everyone&#39;s needs?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you have to insist on your way in order to feel valued? Or to appear <br/>\nworthy/valuable to others???<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 4 (soon to be 5) children, all of whom I adore.  But I also<br/>\nadore who I am.  One of the many things I am is an introvert.  That<br/>\nmeans I NEED a certain amount of alone time to recharge my personal<br/>\nenergy.  Otherwise, I find I don&#39;t have patience, I don&#39;t have joy,<br/>\nand I certainly am NOT a good mom.  Now with 4 children, I take that<br/>\nalone time where I can get it.  As the boys have gotten older, I<br/>\nfind that I can take that time during the day as my youngest naps<br/>\nand the older boys are playing outside, or with their DS/Game cube,<br/>\nor playing a game, or what have you.  But when they were younger,<br/>\nthe only time I had to myself was when they went to bed.  No, I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have them watch TV with me, or fold laundry with me, or do<br/>\nanything else with me.  I needed to be alone.  And that is OKAY.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll find a lot of us here are introverts, needing just as much <br/>\nre-charging time as you do. I have had to get creative with my time <br/>\nthrough the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it does get easier as the children age. And it can be exhausting to <br/>\nhave little ones who demand so much. (Welcome to parenthood!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut saying that a child must sleep in order for me to have alone time <br/>\nreally isn&#39;t OK. I could choose to stay up or get up early, if that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat I need. But to insist that a child must go to sleep (whether <br/>\nsleepy or not) because *I* need alone time is arbitrary. It&#39;s not good <br/>\nfor the child nor for our relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd each of us gets to CHOOSE whether we will have patience, have joy, <br/>\nand be a good mom each and every moment of every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n   I see Jodi saying that something that used to work for her family is <br/>\nno<br/>\nlonger working for her family, and hey, does anyone have any ideas<br/>\nabout things she can to do honor her children&#39;s needs AND her<br/>\nneeds.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the suggestions have been to change the way she looks at the <br/>\nsituation. If we can accept that the children are a part of our lives <br/>\nwholly and fully, we can learn to include them and make them a part of <br/>\nthe solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Jodi&#39;s doing isn&#39;t working. She&#39;s asked for suggestions. Here, in <br/>\nan unschooling forum, the suggestions will be to work WITH the children <br/>\nand their needs instead of AGAINST them. Be their partners, not their <br/>\nadversaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn time (and not all that long, if the mindset is there), evenings will <br/>\nbe peaceful and relaxing. AND mom will get plenty of alone time because <br/>\neveryone&#39;s needs are met. Spending an hour and a half every night to <br/>\nget two children asleep is NO fun. Spending an hour and a half having <br/>\n*fun* will get the children to sleep. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMore new features than ever.

Be at peace, don&#39;t take  <br/>\nit as an attack, and just be open to the universe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been a stay-at-home mom for just about eleven years. I  <br/>\nunderstand the fear of losing yourself, but you aren&#39;t! You are just  <br/>\nredefining yourself as a mom. And redefining what your needs truly  <br/>\nare. I have children with disabilities. I have fallen into the  <br/>\nthinking of how hard it is, it&#39;s a full time job just for one of  <br/>\nthem. But I try to remind myself of the moms who have kids who are  <br/>\nmuch more disabled. Or God forbid, the moms whose children are gone.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s not the kind of peace I want!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted to know what dh is doing between getting home for work  <br/>\nand the girls &#39;bedtimes&#39;. Because that is MY time, when my hubby gets  <br/>\nhome, he has time to relax, go potty, and then we all eat dinner  <br/>\ntogether. After dinner, I do my exercises and reading, check my  <br/>\nemail, etc etc, at that point, and that way when the kids are tired,  <br/>\nI can be fully present for them. Twice a week its scout night with  <br/>\none of the boys, and my time is spent with them, supporting them in  <br/>\nthat. One other night a week I take one of the other kids out, even  <br/>\njust to buy bread. It seems like a relief having just one lol!   It  <br/>\nis intense, my oldest is 12, and he still likes the mom time about  <br/>\nthen. Dh and I split the kids, so that we&#39;re only dividing our time  <br/>\nbetween three boys or four girls. If I need to go to bed early for an  <br/>\nearly appointment, then dh puts the kids to bed himself. If I&#39;m  <br/>\nswiped from a full day (and they are intense, I know)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we have two extra today, so I&#39;d better go. &quot;They&#39;re coming to  <br/>\ntake me away haha!&quot;<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Joshua, Breanna, Emily, Rachel, Samuel, Daniel and Avari<br/>\nWife to Zane<br/>\n<br/>\nblog me at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 26, 2008, at 10:29 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jodi Bezzola &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jodibezzola@...\">jodibezzola@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Between their bedtime and<br/>\n&gt; mine I get a chance to check/write emails, put the chaos of toys and<br/>\n&gt; stuff away,<br/>\n&gt; clean the kitchen, finish laundry, watch tv, actually have the luxury<br/>\n&gt; to read a<br/>\n&gt; book or talk to a friend on the phone, you get the picture.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; RECENT ACTIVITY<br/>\n&gt; 28<br/>\n&gt; New Members<br/>\n&gt; Visit Your Group<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I used to think of all the things I should be doing, instead of being in my room for an hour or so. Now I use that time to get ready for bed, do my teeth, put on PJ&#39;s, ride the exercise bike, or just lay in bed and watch tv, and yes he still comes in 2 or 3 times to make sure I am still there, but that is okay.

My mom and in-laws brought  Brenna to the <br/>\nhospital to see her little brother and after a short visit, I  insisted that <br/>\nshe get home by bedtime so she could get her rest.   I  really did that!!  And <br/>\nthought I was being a good mom for doing it.<br/>\n <br/>\nPerspective, Perspective.   Brenna is now 18 and making plans for  college <br/>\nand Logan is playing WOW at all hours.  I go to Yoga any time I  want and best <br/>\nof all I can go to Yoga with Brenna because we like each other  enough to hang <br/>\nout together.

I had my first child at 28.  That doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean that I need to now look at my life from that point forward as a <br/>\nmom only (just because I had 28 years to be anything I wanted).  I <br/>\nam many things.  And EACH of those aspects of myself deserve to <br/>\nshine--not just the mom part.  This is about balance.  Just because <br/>\nwe have kids doesn&#39;t mean we give up who we are, or what are own <br/>\nneeds are.  I think that is dangerous.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a mother who did that--and who still does that.  And what it <br/>\nmodeled for me (as her child) is that when you grow up, you have no <br/>\nvalue.  My mother never valued herself enough to say, I need <br/>\n______.  It took me until adulthood to realize that we all (no <br/>\nmatter our age, race or parental status) have the right to say I <br/>\nneed ______, and then give ourselves that need.  We all--children <br/>\nAND parents have the right to value ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 4 (soon to be 5) children, all of whom I adore.  But I also <br/>\nadore who I am.  One of the many things I am is an introvert.  That <br/>\nmeans I NEED a certain amount of alone time to recharge my personal <br/>\nenergy.  Otherwise, I find I don&#39;t have patience, I don&#39;t have joy, <br/>\nand I certainly am NOT a good mom.  Now with 4 children, I take that <br/>\nalone time where I can get it.  As the boys have gotten older, I <br/>\nfind that I can take that time during the day as my youngest naps <br/>\nand the older boys are playing outside, or with their DS/Game cube, <br/>\nor playing a game, or what have you.  But when they were younger, <br/>\nthe only time I had to myself was when they went to bed.  No, I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have them watch TV with me, or fold laundry with me, or do <br/>\nanything else with me.  I needed to be alone.  And that is OKAY.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it *all* about me? No, not all.  It is about me, *too*.  It is <br/>\nabout the kids, and about my husband, and about me.  We are a family-<br/>\n-so it is about all of our needs.  And that works for us.  I see <br/>\nJodi saying that something that used to work for her family is no <br/>\nlonger working for her family, and hey, does anyone have any ideas <br/>\nabout things she can to do honor her children&#39;s needs AND her <br/>\nneeds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of ways to do that.  But I don&#39;t think that being <br/>\ncritical of her having and admitting her own needs is own of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96545052,"authorName":"marji","from":"marji &lt;marji@...&gt;","profile":"gaia10921","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: More parenting advice please!","postDate":"1201365646","msgId":29003,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDgwMTI2MTY0MS5tMFFHZlVvSzAwMzk0NUBvbXI1Lm5ldHdvcmtzb2x1dGlvbnNlbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDI0ODg4MS41Njg2LnFtQHdlYjU0MTEwLm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDhDQTJFMzMyRjA5NjM4RS0xNEYwLTM0NUVAd2VibWFpbC1kZDAzLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPiA8MjQ4ODgxLjU2ODYucW1Ad2ViNTQxMTAubWFpbC5yZTIueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":29002,"nextInTopic":29004,"prevInTime":29002,"nextInTime":29004,"topicId":28989,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Why the need for bedtime?<br/>\n<br/>\n   I guess because I still need to have a life of some kind so I know <br/>\nwho I am<br/>\nother than being a mom...I was my own person for 37 years before I had <br/>\nthe girls<br/>\nand I feel like I&#39;m rapidly losing myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s was what I was looking for. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou had 37 years to BE Who You Are.

How long from the time you say <br/>\n&quot;bedtime&quot; to the time they actually go to sleep?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  It takes over an hour for sure, probably closer to an hour and a half.  They love their bath so they usually hang out there for quite awhile, then pjs, then a bottle while we cuddle, read books, watch something.  They get wound down, are rubbing their eyes, yawning (by now they&#39;ve been up over 12 hours and are showing lots of signs of being ready to sleep), so then I ask if they want to go to bed and they either say &#39;not yet&#39; or some version of that, or, &#39;wanna sleep in my bed&#39; or some version of that.  That&#39;s when we carry them to bed, my husband or I lay down with them (whoever they ask for) and that&#39;s when the fun starts.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~What time do you and your husband go to bed? What do you do between the <br/>\ngirls&#39; bedtime and your own? What do you do between the time the girls <br/>\nare actually *asleep* and the time you go to bed?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I go to bed around 10, my husband a little later.  I go to yoga early in the mornings (it&#39;s the only time I&#39;m alone and I&#39;m a pretty crazy mom without it!), so if I&#39;m not asleep by that time I&#39;m really tired in the morning because I&#39;m up at 5 to make it work before my husband goes to work.  Between their bedtime and mine I get a chance to check/write emails, put the chaos of toys and stuff away, clean the kitchen, finish laundry, watch tv, actually have the luxury to read a book or talk to a friend on the phone, you get the picture.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ~~How do you think that time could be better spent? Do you enjoy the ritual you&#39;ve set up? Do the girls? What do *you* think are your options?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  If you mean how could the time after they go to sleep be better spent I don&#39;t think it could be!  If you mean the bedtime ritual with the girls, I don&#39;t really think it could be better spent either because they enjoy it, it seems to be what they want, and they aren&#39;t asking to do anything else or expressing dislike with the ritual.<br/>\n  I don&#39;t necessarily totally enjoy much about the evening routine.  By that time I&#39;ve spent 12+ hours with very intense twins who are in conflict with each other much of the day and make it very challenging to get out the door to do anything at all outside the house.  I&#39;m quite interested in the day being done by that point.  I&#39;m human!  I don&#39;t see alot of options right now which is the main reason I&#39;m asking for help!<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Does the sun come up on their side of the house? Can you put up dark, <br/>\ndark shades in the girls&#39; room to keep them down past 7:00am?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The sun doesn&#39;t come up on their side of the house, plus we have a pull-down blackout blind on their window.  They wake up in the pitch dark every day ready to move!<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Can you live without a &quot;bedtime&quot;? You could still have a routine to get <br/>\nready for bed, but them everyone could gather in bed together and read <br/>\nor talk or watch a movie. Let the girls fall asleep while watching a <br/>\nmovie in your arms. Then carry them to bed. Why the need for bedtime?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I guess because I still need to have a life of some kind so I know who I am other than being a mom...I was my own person for 37 years before I had the girls and I feel like I&#39;m rapidly losing myself.  I don&#39;t work outside the home, and it&#39;s SO all about them that I struggle with resentment if I don&#39;t at least get a chance to read a chapter in a book and go to yoga every day!  How do other unschoolers handle this aspect when their kids are up/down at all hours??  Is there never to be a quiet hour in the house for me to just be me?<br/>\n  And what you describe above is exactly what we do, and I think I described it above that they ask to go to bed and then it&#39;s after they&#39;re tucked in that they start the &#39;I need something&#39; or some version of that.  Frustrating, because I can plainly see that they are so tired but they won&#39;t stop moving!!<br/>\n<br/>\n~~How could you better spend your time each evening that wouldn&#39;t be a <br/>\nnightly struggle?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I don&#39;t know, can you tell me? :o)))  I get teased every evening that they&#39;re so tired they&#39;re actually going to sleep, and then...they&#39;re up again...and again...and again...it&#39;s really really challenging to not get frustrated because I feel like by this point I have absolutely no patience left at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Just because bedtime has worked since they were little doesn&#39;t mean it <br/>\ncan still work. You may need to think outside your box. How could you <br/>\nbetter spend that hour or two?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I totally get that things get different quickly and all the time when there are little ones in the house.  See above answer! :o)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks for listening,<br/>\n  Jodi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n          -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jodi Bezzola &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jodibezzola@...\">jodibezzola@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI do make sure and ask them to gather what they want before we tuck in, <br/>\nand we<br/>\nusually do a tour together so they can peruse their collection of stuff <br/>\nand<br/>\ngather what they want.

It doesn&#39;t really make sense for bedtime to be later - they wake around 7 no matter what time they go to bed and are very tired by 8 p.m. - they don&#39;t stop moving all day and we always run around outside for a nature walk or park play of some kind too.  So...it also doesn&#39;t work for them to stay up after we go to bed since at 3 yrs they are quite destructive and very much get into things kids and I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep wondering what they were getting into next and not knowing for sure if they were safe or not without someone checking in on them.  If they would ever sleep in it wouldn&#39;t be such a big deal, but man, are they owly when they don&#39;t get the sleep they need!  And at 3 do little people really know how to fix sleep deprivation??  Sometimes during the day they say they are tired, but<br/>\n will never just sit/lie down to rest or have a nap.
