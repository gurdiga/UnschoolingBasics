Generally, &quot;power trips&quot; are about feeling powerLess, so the more ways your dh has to feel capable where the kids are concerned, the less likely he will be to default to things like yelling or demanding or looking for ways to punish. The catch to that is that telling your dh he&#39;s doing things &quot;wrong&quot; (or even suggesting that by jumping in or overriding him when that&#39;s not what he wants) can lead to him feeling even more powerless and so, even more inclined to stick with what (little) he knows.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he can read here or any of the other radical unschooling lists or sites, that would be a good thing, but if not, one of the things that helped with George, when we were still figuring things out, was to share with him the ups and downs of my day - things that went well, and things that bombed. That let him &quot;see&quot; my learning process and not feel like I was &quot;the parenting expert&quot; that he somehow had to live up to (or resist). It also helped a lot to let him know how much I appreciated him as a person, all his positive qualities, all the many things he did/does for the family. A big part of dads &quot;getting it&quot; much of the time, is that they have to feel some of the same warmth and love the kids get to bask in all day. When they are getting some of the good stuff, its much easier for them to *want* to pass that along to their children.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] new member saying &quot;hi&quot; and asking advice","postDate":"1247823546","msgId":40768,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3NDc5RTFDLTRGMzgtNDAyNS1CMkYwLTEzNkIzOEYzMkFENEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGgzb2ZvMityanByQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGgzb2ZvMityanByQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40764,"nextInTopic":40769,"prevInTime":40767,"nextInTime":40769,"topicId":40764,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
