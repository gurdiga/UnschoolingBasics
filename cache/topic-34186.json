My husband is frequently consumed<br/>\nby guilt because he has distanced himself from his emotional abusive<br/>\nfather. He feels he SHOULD love him and he does but he doesn&#39;t love<br/>\nthe behavior or the abuse or his father&#39;s denial of it therefore feels<br/>\nguilty that he can&#39;t let it go and have a relationship.  I keep<br/>\npointing out that he is asking for emotionally healthy normal behavior<br/>\nfrom someone incapable because he is not an emotionally healthy normal<br/>\n person.   Consequently we spend way too much time (in my opinion)<br/>\nwith him feeling like a bad person because he can&#39;t repair this<br/>\nrelationship.   I always feel like his dwelling on that damages the<br/>\nrelationship he is unable to have with his own children because of his<br/>\nbad feelings/depression about his own childhood.    I have begged him<br/>\nfrequently to commit to being happy in the place he is.. not fretting<br/>\nover what wasn&#39;t , what can&#39;t be and what may never be.   <br/>\nWe miss so much by dwelling on the past and not cherishing the present!<br/>\nLisa B <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;diana jenner&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Fri, Jun 27, 2008 at 6:45 AM, jamieminnis &lt;jamieminnis@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Ok, this is dragging on.
