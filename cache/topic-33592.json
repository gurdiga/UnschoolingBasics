I have<br/>\nbeen homeschooling for about a year (School year) with a public homebased<br/>\nprogram. We are tired of worksheets! We are new to unschooling but I am<br/>\nreading everything I can get my hands on. My son is on the autism spectrum<br/>\nand has had early intervention since he was 2..so long hours in the<br/>\nclassroom. I realized that he needed to be out of school after countless<br/>\ndays of screaming, crying and melting down after school. He was so unhappy.<br/>\nWe have had a good year but I am ready to move on to greener pastures and a<br/>\nmore freedom for all of us. I have a 5 year old (will be six this fall) and<br/>\na 4 year old. My 5 year old is on the spectrum but extremely high<br/>\nfunctioning so we are ready to put the &quot;diagnosis&quot; in the closet for the<br/>\nmost part. He still has outside therapists that come to the house to do play<br/>\ntherapy (DIR) and I find it has helped him...they follow his lead so I am<br/>\nhoping it is not going to hurt. I am OVER behavioral therapy.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in California and I would love some advice on how to get out of the<br/>\nschool district and file privately spefically in California. We are in<br/>\nspecial ed and I don&#39;t yet feel comfortable closing the door on them but we<br/>\nonly have 30 minute consolations once a month anyway.
