I don&#39;t know if you have <br/>\ncovered this topic or not but it&#39;s pretty real for me right now so I <br/>\nwould like your opinion.  We&#39;re in the process of starting a Spiral <br/>\nScouts group and I&#39;m having second thoughts about it because of the use <br/>\nof badges/pins.  To me it is an extrinsic motivator and I don&#39;t get why <br/>\nthe kids need to do the badges.  I would love the kids to do the <br/>\nactivities without getting a reward.  Maybe I&#39;ve been influenced too <br/>\nmuch by Alfie Kohn but I don&#39;t understand why everybody doesn&#39;t think <br/>\nlike me.  :-)   Since I&#39;m sure some of you unschoolers wouldn&#39;t have a <br/>\nproblem with it, I would like to hear your opinions.  Some people say <br/>\nthat the badge is just for remembering what a good time they had in <br/>\nscouting but I think photographs would do the trick.  I&#39;m trying to <br/>\nconvince myself that it is okay because I don&#39;t want to cause any <br/>\nfriction in the group but I feel like I&#39;m always compromising my <br/>\nbeliefs to make everybody happy.  On the other hand, is it really that <br/>\nbig of a deal if they would get badges/pins?<br/>\n<br/>\nDenise</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6433,"nextTopicId":6417}}
