Way back when, DS wanted to buy a plastic light saber. It cost about $15 or so. He saved up and saved up (mind you, he was maybe 7 or so at the time and got about $10 per month allowance). He&#39;d save, then spend a little, and so on. And, he had determined that he needed TWO of them so he could battle with someone else (mostly me lol). That&#39;s $30 plus tax. Once he&#39;d gotten to about $20, I offered to pitch in the rest for &quot;my&quot; light saber. He said most definitively NO, he was going to do it himself. And he did! He was so thrilled to hand over his OWN money to the cashier and leave triumphantly with HIS purchase.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing we&#39;ve noticed over the years is that a history of openness with resources (money, time, stuff) has led us to see a teenager who is both thrifty (he hates paying full price for videogames - he&#39;d rather watch Youtube playthrus for two months and wait for the price to drop) AND generous with his resources. Oh, also, while we have often been somewhat &#39;relaxed&#39; about collecting his $2-$3 type &quot;borrowings&quot;, we are diligent/prompt about repaying if we borrow from him (yes, that happens, he often has more cash on hand at home than us adults).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

Despite parental fears, there&#39;s no actual evidence that chores and chore-based allowances set anyone up to learn any useful skills - if anything, there&#39;s a lot of evidence to the contrary! Most of the people who are bad with money  received it on the condition of chores as kids. That&#39;s the downside of Any kind of teaching - not only does it not guarantee learning, it frequently undermines it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s more on the subject of chores here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/chores/\">http://sandradodd.com/chores/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I am making ds 9, pay me back $60 for part of a Lego thing that he wanted. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s kind of like insisting a school child pay for his own books and supplies. Toys and games are some of the key &quot;educational materials&quot; of childhood (better than school books and supplies, too - kids certainly learn more from them, and more enjoyably). Any time you&#39;re balking at spending money on something for a child, it can help to consider how much you would otherwise be spending on books or a curriculum. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":478543977,"authorName":"Iska Scholl","from":"Iska Scholl &lt;iskascholl@...&gt;","profile":"ischoll2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: paying for things they want?","postDate":"1360257093","msgId":49528,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVCQTFBNzk0LUY0RDMtNENFNC1CRTU0LTI0M0Y1RUY0RkE5OEBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49527,"nextInTopic":49530,"prevInTime":49527,"nextInTime":49529,"topicId":49524,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My children pay for some things themselves.
