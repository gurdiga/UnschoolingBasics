I wondered if you wanted to reconnect with him<br/>\nmore and really feel like you *want* to have sex or if<br/>\nyou want to know it is truly okay to not have it if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t feel like it.  I had originally thought you<br/>\nwere looking for ways to want to again, but now I want<br/>\nto add this: <br/>\n1. My husband and I respect each other&#39;s feelings and<br/>\njust tell each other if we are not interested.  And<br/>\nthat I do believe that a person should not just do it<br/>\nto please another.  Of course, each person must decide<br/>\nwhether the are willing to just do it or not.  2. I<br/>\nagree with other posters that you can just feel so<br/>\ntouched out and stretched in so many ways, esp when<br/>\nyou have wee ones and are nursing around the clock.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t feel like it for so long after the birth of my<br/>\nkids!! <br/>\n3. And lastly, if there are other issues going on<br/>\nbetween the two of you, you may not feel like it<br/>\nbecause you may feel upset with either him or yourself<br/>\nor both.  Resolving conflicts or just the process<br/>\nitself of beginning to address conflicts might help<br/>\nyou to feel closer (if that is what you are seeking). <br/>\nLook within yourself to realize what  you want and<br/>\nwhat you need to do to to get there.

Take a long bubble bath,  ask for the space and<br/>\nquiet that you need ...if you take care of you it makes you a better<br/>\nmother and wife (when the tank is empty you have nothing to give!)  <br/>\nIn those days my kids went to bed fairly early (9 or 10) So after they<br/>\nwere down for the night I hit the tub!   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe second thing is that if you touch your husband and accept his<br/>\ntouch throughout the day it builds a deeper intimacy that in my<br/>\nopinion makes you feel less &quot;surprised&quot; when he wants to have sex. <br/>\nThink of it as continuous foreplay!   My husband is a toucher so my<br/>\nfirst reaction when we were first together was &quot;uh oh he&#39;s touching me<br/>\nthat means he wants something more&quot;  which was my experience in<br/>\nprevious relationships.   For him it&#39;s an extension of his love and<br/>\nhis need for touch...to touch and be touched.   During those times I<br/>\nfelt less receptive I would realize that we were so busy we weren&#39;t<br/>\ntouching each other like we usually did.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that I think helps is that we value our time alone<br/>\ntogether.... when our kids were little we would go away for a weekend<br/>\nalone a couple of times a year and leave the children with their<br/>\ngrandparents.   We find time to go and have lunch together, we shop<br/>\ntogether and other little things like that that just give us small<br/>\nbits of time together to reconnect.   I think when you do that you<br/>\nfeel less torn at home when you want to be with your spouse and your<br/>\nchildren and everyone&#39;s needs seem to weigh heavily on you.    <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso be honest with your husband.... let him know that how you feel so<br/>\nyou aren&#39;t&#39; just playing this avoidance game that leaves him wondering<br/>\nwhat&#39;s wrong with him!    Men are very visual so understand that him<br/>\nwanting to be intimate is a bit compliment because the mere sight of<br/>\nyou does it for him!  It&#39;s also the reason that it&#39;s hard for men to<br/>\njust &quot;cuddle&quot; or to rub your back and not want more.    If you are<br/>\nhonest and tell them you need to feel loved and cherished by touching<br/>\nonly and the expectation is clear then you are both getting your needs<br/>\nmet.  I have found lots of times when he is able to give me what I<br/>\nneed and understand the limits of it then the deeper intimacy comes<br/>\nalong on it&#39;s own (not always that night but it starts the process).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway those are things that have helped my relationship with my<br/>\nhusband... hopefully something I have shared will help yours!   It&#39;s<br/>\nso hard to feel like you are letting someone down or that there&#39;s<br/>\nsomething wrong with you (I mean everyone else just loves sex and has<br/>\nit 14 times a week don&#39;t they??

Like spend more time together doing things<br/>\nyou both enjoy.  This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean alone,<br/>\nyou can do it anytime.  Ie. If the kids are playing on<br/>\nthe floor and dh is playing with them, join them and<br/>\nsit close to dh.  Play too and enjoy yourself and your<br/>\nfamily.  And do take advantage of snuggling or hugging<br/>\nif you enjoy that and wish to just let him know you<br/>\nlove him.  Like if you are all watching tv or reading<br/>\na book together, do sit next to dh and relax together.<br/>\n All these little interactions might add up and make<br/>\nyou feel more positive towards your dh and in general.<br/>\n And...well...maybe just plan on cuddling in bed naked<br/>\n(after kiddos are sleeping) and just see if that leads<br/>\nanywhere or not.  Sometimes it might just be nice to<br/>\nsnuggle that way, and other times it might turn you on<br/>\nand lead to more.

It&#39;s<br/>\nalso up to me to respectfully address this with the other half of We.<br/>\n<br/>\n...Or... have you considered the possibility that what lights your fire<br/>\ncould be so drastically different than what it was before you had kids that<br/>\nyou might not even know what it is?  People change constantly, and<br/>\nsometimes, dramatically.  Since having kids, your needs have changed.  You<br/>\ngive of yourself in different and in more intense ways.  You give more of<br/>\nyourself than ever before.  So why wouldn&#39;t your personal, intimate needs<br/>\nchange?  Maybe even drasitcally?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what if you know what that is, but he doesn&#39;t?  How do you tell your DH<br/>\nto try something different?  To repeat an earlier post,<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In general, men get affirmation of the love their wives feel for them<br/>\n&gt; through sex. It&#39;s NOT just a physical release. It is often one of the only<br/>\n&gt; times that they are vulnerable and open.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sometimes shocks me how insecure I am when being intimate with DW.  If<br/>\nshe says, &quot;Hey, are you willing to try something?&quot; I hear, &quot;You know, you<br/>\njust couldn&#39;t do it for me.  Something&#39;s wrong with you.&quot;  Doesn&#39;t make<br/>\nsense unless you understand the insecurity there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how to broach new things with DH and (hopefully) still keep everyone<br/>\nhaving fun?<br/>\n<br/>\na.  Unschool your DH.  Respectful interaction.  We&#39;ve learned (somewhat,<br/>\nanyway) how to talk to our own kids respectfully.  Gotta apply it to us,<br/>\ntoo.  Our egos are only 5 years old, sometimes, too.<br/>\nb.  A long lead-in time for me to get used to the idea.  This helps me get<br/>\nover my insecurity, sometimes by half-believing it was my own idea by the<br/>\ntime we get to it.<br/>\nc.  if you get as far as actually trying something different, then while DH<br/>\nis &#39;assisting&#39;, then very positive encouragement.  Almost ridiculously<br/>\npositive encouragement.

I figured this <br/>\nsort of ties in with unschooling, because unschooling is about <br/>\nchoice and sometimes I feel like I don&#39;t have choice and must do an <br/>\nobligatory duty.  I don&#39;t like to feel that way about it, but here <br/>\nlately I have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI will definitely take into account ovulation.  I had not remembered <br/>\nthat ovulation was a time that may be best for libido (not sure if I <br/>\nhave any of that though).  My mom says what I&#39;m experiencing is not <br/>\nnormal and I should have my hormones checked, which I might do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSarah, my husband also went through a spell where he did not have <br/>\ninterest in sex.  It was while I was pregnant and it was so hard for <br/>\nme.  I remember feeling rejection and I know that is how he is <br/>\nfeeling right now.  However, I tried not to make him feel <br/>\ncompelled.  It has gone full circle with us it seems.  I remember <br/>\nthat what we did to help him when he had no interest was we watched <br/>\nsome &quot;steamy&quot; films together and that really helped and then he was <br/>\nbetter as I recall.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have done more thinking today and one idea is that we should try <br/>\nto get together at another time rather than late at night on the <br/>\nweekends.  Also, exercise may give me more energy and help me feel <br/>\nbetter about myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it fair to tell him though that just because it&#39;s been 3 weeks,  <br/>\nI don&#39;t have to do something I don&#39;t feel like doing?<br/>\n<br/>\nMartha  -<br/>\n<br/>\n-- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sarah Wilson &lt;sarah@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is really interesting as I am having the same issues but the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>other <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; way round - as it is DH who seems to have gone off the idea.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can really identify with the &#39;its been 3 weeks&#39; comment as its <br/>\n&gt; something I find myself saying to him<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I must admit that I tend to &#39;personalise&#39; it and feel that it must <br/>\n </span></blockquote>be <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; some failing in me - reading your story and seeing the issue &#39;from <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; other side&#39; so to speak has made me think again, that maybe it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>doesnt <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; all centre around me and my percieved failings, but has more to do <br/>\n </span></blockquote>with <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; DH and how he is feeling.

After <br/>\nabout 2 weeks, he announces how much time has gone by, and then I <br/>\ngive in after 3 weeks, when he declares that it&#39;s now been 3 weeks!  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that really got me thinking about unschooling, is how I <br/>\ndon&#39;t enjoy feeling forced into doing this (and that&#39;s how I feel) <br/>\nbut if I don&#39;t comply, I probably won&#39;t stay married.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDo other wives feel this way?  I feel I&#39;ve had enough sex to last me <br/>\na lifetime and just don&#39;t want to do it anymore.  I am 43 and once <br/>\nwe get going, I enjoy the encounter and we definitely &quot;are great&quot; <br/>\ntogether.  I think, &quot;why don&#39;t I want to do this?  It felt <br/>\nwonderful.&quot;  But then afterwards, I just am not in the mood.  I <br/>\nthink most of it may be that I am very tired in the evening.  We get <br/>\ntogether only on the weekends because my husband gets up VERY early <br/>\nand I go to bed later.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions would be very appreciated.  If this discussion is <br/>\ninappropriate for here, then I certainly understand.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMartha</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28531,"nextTopicId":28536}}
