She was 6 years old and had only been told by her mother that she<br/>\nwas going to be attending a new school that day and &#39;had better behave.&#39;<br/>\n Little did she know that she would be bombarded with jeers and even death<br/>\nthreats, and that she would end up being the sole child in her first grade<br/>\nclass after other children were kept home by their parents.&quot;  All because<br/>\nRuby was Black. *<br/>\n<br/>\n*Forty-eight years later -- January 5, 2009 -- here is a picture of Sasha<br/>\nObama, a little 7 year old Black girl, being escorted to school by her<br/>\nmother, First Lady-elect Michelle Obama, and the Secret Service because<br/>\nSasha&#39;s daddy is now President-elect of the United States. *<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ------------------------------<br/>\nNew year...new news.
