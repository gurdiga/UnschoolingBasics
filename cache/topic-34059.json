I moved some furniture and they now take over almost 2 whole walls in one room of the house to be painted on and decorated and basically doing with as they please. My 3 y.o. has always loved painting on anything he can think of (Harold and the Purple Crayon is one of his favorite books), and I have had to come up with lots of creative ways to accommodate him and his dad&#39;s wishes at the same time, but found lots of ways to do so (a roll of paper suspended from a string from the top of the door, paint that can go on glass etc.).<br/>\nAnd yes, I was vegetarian (even vegan) once and when I was pregnant with my first I started to have cravings for fish. I did not give in to them  thinking my now ex was going to be critical. My protein was always low, even though I had lots of beans and soy protein shakes etc. etc. and gained 45 pounds eating what I thought was healthy). I still feel bad about not listening to my child when in utero. When he was about 10 months old we were visiting a friend and I had cooked some fish for her. He just crawled over to her plate, grabbed it and gobbled it down. Since then I have never restricted any food I or my children would like to try. Sometimes we talk about how the different foods make us feel (Lucian called the peas they picked yesterday superpowerpellets, and said they make him feel strong, Doritos give him a headache and he does not want them anymore etc.). But also just if that is what we want to do - <br/>\nMara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;gailbrocop@...&quot; &lt;gailbrocop@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 25, 2008 11:00:13 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: the veg thing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 6/25/2008 9:24:22 A.M.

The room looks awesome and I would love a room that my kids  and <br/>\nfriends had painted. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been following this whole thread and remembering our lives  before <br/>\nunschooling when I used to say things like...&quot;We just  don&#39;t....... ......(fill in <br/>\nthe blank)   ----watch more than one hour  of TV a day,  allow guns in the ho<br/>\nuse or even watch things with any  violence,  eat at McDonalds!  Really, I said <br/>\nand believed all  those things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look at the close relationships I have with my kids who are now 15 and 18 <br/>\nand I know it would not have been possible if I had continued to control  and <br/>\nmicro manage them with all my &quot;We just don&#39;ts&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are so thoughtful and make such good decisions because they have been <br/>\ntrusted to decide what they eat, when they sleep, what they paint on the walls, <br/>\nwhat they watch on TV and how they choose to spend their time. They learned <br/>\nto  make their own decisions through seeing choices their parents made, <br/>\nongoing  discussions, and trial and error.   I have changed my vocabulary to  not <br/>\ninclude the phrase.. &quot;We just don&#39;t...&quot; simply because it  limits possibilities <br/>\nthat might be amazing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would hate to think I had missed those hours watching &quot;Friends, That 70&#39;s <br/>\nShow and Family Guy with them because it was more than an hour a day.  And <br/>\nthe amazing potato guns that we made that shoot potatoes half way across  the <br/>\nriver.  And Pulp Fiction....we would have missed that too.  And  those late <br/>\nnight runs to get chocolate shakes just because I didn&#39;t like  McDonalds... would <br/>\nhave missed all that.  So many memories that we  share that make up the <br/>\nkaleidoscope of our lives are just because I got rid  of &quot;We don&#39;t do that in our <br/>\nfamily and replaced it with....&quot;Why Not?&quot;   And  &quot;Yes, let&#39;s find a way to make <br/>\nthat happen.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust that simple thing made their lives so much bigger and all our lives so <br/>\nmuch richer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly would have thought it someone was crazy 7 years ago if  someone <br/>\nhad said &quot;Why not let your child paint on the walls&quot;     My journey from &quot;Why <br/>\nnot watch more than one hour of TV a day&quot; to   &quot;Why not paint on the walls&quot; <br/>\ndidn&#39;t happen  overnight .  However, I am reminded every day that changing  my <br/>\nvocabulary helped me to change my parenting and the result has been  remarkable.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad for this thread because it reminded me about Logan wanting to  paint on <br/>\nsome walls and thinking we could get the paint today.<br/>\n<br/>\nGail <br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://gail- hummingbirdhaven .blogspot. com/<br/>\n<br/>\n************ **Gas prices getting you down?
