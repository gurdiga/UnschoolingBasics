You asked if parents are dishonoring their whole child if <br/>\nthey<br/>\nhave the child get glasses because of so-called vision loss.  They are. <br/>\n  If<br/>\nthe child doesn&#39;t want glasses, doesn&#39;t regard himself or herself as <br/>\nhaving<br/>\na need for glasses or whatever, and if the child is, as far as she or <br/>\nhe is<br/>\nconcerned before being taught otherwise, happy with the body she or he <br/>\nwas<br/>\nborn with, the parents are not honoring the whole child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologize if you didn&#39;t ask for help, and all of this discussion is <br/>\nvery<br/>\nmuch unwanted help.  I haven&#39;t read your first message on this, and I am<br/>\nstill working my way toward that in my inbox after returning from a <br/>\nbusiness<br/>\ntrip to find over a thousand messages.  But this discusson did happen, <br/>\nand I<br/>\nfelt I needed to share some thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s REALLY important for Jennifer and others to understand a <br/>\nHUGE point of the list and how it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s NOT about Jennifer. It&#39;s not about Jennifer&#39;s kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about the idea that we think we, as parents, know better.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer---and Jennifer&#39;s children---may be perfectly happy with the <br/>\ndecisions that have been made. No one&#39;s trying to get her to change. <br/>\nShe may. She may not. That&#39;s not the point.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT...there may be seven---or 70 or 700!---other people on this list <br/>\nwho have benefitted from the discussion. It may make a difference to <br/>\nanother family who is struggling with a similar issue...now or in the <br/>\nfuture. The goal is to throw an idea or problem out there, toss it <br/>\naround a bit, and come up with different strategies--especially ones <br/>\nthat honor the children&#39;s wishes. No one here can *make* another do <br/>\nsomething or choose something. But sometimes we get a different <br/>\nperspective from all the discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32104,"nextTopicId":32118}}
