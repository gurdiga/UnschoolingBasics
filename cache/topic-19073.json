It&#39;s hard to do half-way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause unschooling is built on Trust, wavering back and forth or <br/>\nstopping and starting or &quot;unschooling except for math&quot; doesn&#39;t allow <br/>\ntrust to take hold---the children (and *you*) are never sure where you <br/>\nstand.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry to ramble. i guess i dont have anyone to talk to around her<br/>\nthat could maybe understand where i am coming from.<br/>\n<br/>\n=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere are you?

I am brand new, less that a month, at <br/>\nunschooling and I think I feel as though I am not doing enough perhaps <br/>\nbecause of the schooling that I received growing up. My kids are 3 and 5. We <br/>\njust moved into our house less than a month ago...an 80 year old house that <br/>\nneeds a lot of fixing up. My daughter,much to my surprise, stated that she <br/>\nwould rather be  homeschooled as opposed to going to school. She really does <br/>\nmiss the interaction though with her friends in Kindergarten. I feel so <br/>\nguilty about this. I have just signed her up for Girl Scouts and I have <br/>\njoined the Circle of Friends homeschool group (Yahoo groups). Circle HS is <br/>\ngreat because they have a calendar of events (field trips and such) that <br/>\nthey do on a regular basis. I went out and bought textbooks but my daughter <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to use them. Sometimes it even seems like she&#39;s regressing and <br/>\n&quot;acting like a baby&quot;. I don&#39;t know why. She&#39;s very bright for her age and <br/>\nremembers everything. What area do you live in? Would you like to meet up <br/>\nfor a playdate?

I<br/>\n&gt;find many of your post very helpful to me and my situation.<br/>\n&gt;  I am not sure where to start. I dont want to bore you to death but I<br/>\n&gt;know you cant help me with your thought and opinions if you dont know<br/>\n&gt;where I am coming from.<br/>\n&gt;Lets see we started homeschooling 4 years ago . We have 3 girls, 11, 8,<br/>\n&gt;and 6. We have a small farm and raise chickens, goats and dogs. Also a<br/>\n&gt;good size garen and what ever other animals the girls can find to raise.<br/>\n&gt;  We are also very active in church, 4H, Girl Scouts, and a local home<br/>\n&gt;school support group that a friend and I started a year ago. Did I<br/>\n&gt;mention we are in the process of building a new home, so for now we are<br/>\n&gt;in a large 5th wheel camper.<br/>\n&gt;  The girls range in ability from one with a high IQ to one with reading<br/>\n&gt;disablities. I have tried many different curriculums and have only<br/>\n&gt;found that the younger 2 like Horizons for math. We try to do hooked on<br/>\n&gt;phonics but the middle child hates to read. The oldest finds most work<br/>\n&gt;boring. But she will read any animal science book she can get her hands<br/>\n&gt;on.<br/>\n&gt;  I have struggled each year to get the 4 hours of book work in each day<br/>\n&gt;that my stated requires. Actually it does require book work just that<br/>\n&gt;you spend 4 hours a day learning.<br/>\n&gt;  I have been researching unschooling for at least the last year or so.<br/>\n&gt;I think this is us. I at times am very confused and worried about what<br/>\n&gt;i am doing. the girls do work the farm everyday. they all go to 4h even<br/>\n&gt;though it is for 4h or higher. we do the home school group and then a<br/>\n&gt;lot of extra ag groups. they all do to scouts. and we all do church.<br/>\n&gt;then there are field trips that we go on. there is at least 2 a week we<br/>\n&gt;could do but we dont.<br/>\n&gt;we play board games , card games and more all the time.<br/>\n&gt;my issue is my husband. he totally leaves the school work up to me. but<br/>\n&gt;lately has been questioning the girls and me if they have done enough<br/>\n&gt;book work.<br/>\n&gt;when i have spoke with him of unschooling , he only hears the un part.<br/>\n&gt;i see the girls learning everyday in many different ways. i think he is<br/>\n&gt;blinded to it. i am at a loss of what to do.<br/>\n&gt;should i just jump with both feet in and unschool all the way. from<br/>\n&gt;what i have read up on each family is different. my younest child loves<br/>\n&gt;her math book but no other books. well she loves fun pads.  middle<br/>\n&gt;daugher loves to write , she can not spell but she loves to copy words<br/>\n&gt;out of books. she is good at math but does not choose to do it. unless<br/>\n&gt;it is while playing store. oldest daughter loves animals and trys to<br/>\n&gt;learn as much as possible by reading. i try to cater to that , this is<br/>\n&gt;one reason we are very active in 4H.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am sorry to ramble. i guess i dont have anyone to talk to around her<br/>\n&gt;that could maybe understand where i am coming from.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am hoping that someone out there has some helpful hints for me. I am<br/>\n&gt;at the stage where i feel something needs to change. I have prayed and<br/>\n&gt;prayed about it and i truly feel the Lord lead me here to this group<br/>\n&gt;and to unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for listening<br/>\n&gt;Buffie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nShare your latest news with your friends with the Windows Live Spaces <br/>\nfriends module. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clk.atdmt.com/MSN/go/msnnkwsp0070000001msn/direct/01/?href=http://spaces.live.com/spacesapi.aspx?wx_action=create&wx_url=/friends.aspx&mk\">http://clk.atdmt.com/MSN/go/msnnkwsp0070000001msn/direct/01/?href=http://spaces.live.com/spacesapi.aspx?wx_action=create&wx_url=/friends.aspx&mk</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle Leifur Reid","from":"&quot;Michelle Leifur Reid&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] ? about unschooling ?","postDate":"1164027508","msgId":19077,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjExMjAwNDU4dzJjN2IyZmUybzZkMDUwOWU1ZThhYzY2MWJAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVqcjhkaStkcGEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVqcjhkaStkcGEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19073,"nextInTopic":19080,"prevInTime":19076,"nextInTime":19078,"topicId":19073,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Farm, home building<br/>\n(gee there&#39;s some education for you - involve them in that as you<br/>\ngo!), 4H, GS, homeschool group, etc.  Search your area for other<br/>\nunschoolers - that will really help.  Even if it is just e-mail<br/>\ncontact in your state.  Until your dh gets comfortable with<br/>\nunschooling, point out to him all the things the girls ARE doing, not<br/>\nwhat they AREN&#39;T!

I <br/>\nfind many of your post very helpful to me and my situation.<br/>\n I am not sure where to start. I dont want to bore you to death but I <br/>\nknow you cant help me with your thought and opinions if you dont know <br/>\nwhere I am coming from.<br/>\nLets see we started homeschooling 4 years ago . We have 3 girls, 11, 8, <br/>\nand 6. We have a small farm and raise chickens, goats and dogs. Also a <br/>\ngood size garen and what ever other animals the girls can find to raise.<br/>\n We are also very active in church, 4H, Girl Scouts, and a local home <br/>\nschool support group that a friend and I started a year ago. Did I <br/>\nmention we are in the process of building a new home, so for now we are <br/>\nin a large 5th wheel camper.<br/>\n The girls range in ability from one with a high IQ to one with reading <br/>\ndisablities. I have tried many different curriculums and have only <br/>\nfound that the younger 2 like Horizons for math. We try to do hooked on <br/>\nphonics but the middle child hates to read. The oldest finds most work <br/>\nboring. But she will read any animal science book she can get her hands <br/>\non. <br/>\n I have struggled each year to get the 4 hours of book work in each day <br/>\nthat my stated requires. Actually it does require book work just that <br/>\nyou spend 4 hours a day learning. <br/>\n I have been researching unschooling for at least the last year or so. <br/>\nI think this is us. I at times am very confused and worried about what <br/>\ni am doing. the girls do work the farm everyday. they all go to 4h even <br/>\nthough it is for 4h or higher. we do the home school group and then a <br/>\nlot of extra ag groups. they all do to scouts. and we all do church. <br/>\nthen there are field trips that we go on. there is at least 2 a week we <br/>\ncould do but we dont.<br/>\nwe play board games , card games and more all the time. <br/>\nmy issue is my husband. he totally leaves the school work up to me. but <br/>\nlately has been questioning the girls and me if they have done enough <br/>\nbook work. <br/>\nwhen i have spoke with him of unschooling , he only hears the un part. <br/>\ni see the girls learning everyday in many different ways. i think he is <br/>\nblinded to it. i am at a loss of what to do. <br/>\nshould i just jump with both feet in and unschool all the way. from <br/>\nwhat i have read up on each family is different. my younest child loves <br/>\nher math book but no other books. well she loves fun pads.  middle <br/>\ndaugher loves to write , she can not spell but she loves to copy words <br/>\nout of books. she is good at math but does not choose to do it. unless <br/>\nit is while playing store. oldest daughter loves animals and trys to <br/>\nlearn as much as possible by reading. i try to cater to that , this is <br/>\none reason we are very active in 4H.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry to ramble. i guess i dont have anyone to talk to around her <br/>\nthat could maybe understand where i am coming from.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am hoping that someone out there has some helpful hints for me. I am <br/>\nat the stage where i feel something needs to change. I have prayed and <br/>\nprayed about it and i truly feel the Lord lead me here to this group <br/>\nand to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening<br/>\nBuffie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16006,"nextTopicId":19078}}
