But there was a minor issue over playing adventure quest rpg on the <br/>\nwii; Linnaea was playing and Simon wanted to. Simon got really upset, and <br/>\ncurled up in a ball on the floor. I offered to let him use my computer, <br/>\nasked Linnaea if she could tell him when she&#39;d be done. Linnaea offered him <br/>\nthe game. It was amazing to watch this 7 year old girl be willing to give up <br/>\nwhat she was doing to help her big brother feel better. He didn&#39;t want it by <br/>\nthen, he&#39;d gotten to upset. He lay down for a while until he decided that a <br/>\nchocolate ice cream would make many things better. And it did. I am so <br/>\nimpressed with how much they are willing to work with each other to move <br/>\nthrough limitations, like only one wii, only one front seat, what show to <br/>\nwatch. And that comes because David and I are willing to help them work <br/>\nthrough things. It comes because it feels much nicer to help someone have a <br/>\ngood time with you, than to have both of you feel miserable and angry on <br/>\nyour own. I didn&#39;t know that until much, much later in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24203,"nextTopicId":24239}}
