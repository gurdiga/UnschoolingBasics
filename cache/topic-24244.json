But let me just point out this  <br/>\none: Just because you don&#39;t arbitrarily tell your kid &quot;no&quot; doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nmean you aren&#39;t protecting them from harm. I think that&#39;s the piece  <br/>\nyou&#39;re not getting--that you can let go of authoritarian parenting  <br/>\nand still be totally--even more--engaged with your kids, more  <br/>\ninvolved with them, offering more guidance and support while also  <br/>\noffering them trust and respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you see people who say they are unschooling who are actually  <br/>\nbeing neglectful. I&#39;ve seen that once or twice--or at least, it has  <br/>\nlooked like that to me in one or two families I&#39;ve met, though it&#39;s  <br/>\nhard to say with only a partial view. But that&#39;s not what anybody  <br/>\nhere is advocating, even though you&#39;re trying very hard to read  <br/>\npeople&#39;s responses that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat &quot;arbitrary&quot; piece is really important. I still have little kids,  <br/>\n6 and 3, so sometimes I do have to make a decision to say &quot;no&quot; to  <br/>\nthem. It might be because I don&#39;t have the money for what they&#39;re  <br/>\nasking for, or, sometimes, because I feel they are in imminent danger  <br/>\nof harming themselves or the environment or me. But I don&#39;t say &quot;no&quot;  <br/>\nto them for my own convenience. I don&#39;t say &quot;no&quot; to them just because  <br/>\nI&#39;m the grownup and I can. I don&#39;t say &quot;no&quot; to them and then toss  <br/>\nthem back on their own resources, all alone, to find an alternative,  <br/>\nlike I see so many parents doing (&quot;Stop jumping on the bed and go  <br/>\nfind something else to do.&quot; Instead, I might say, &quot;Let&#39;s see if we  <br/>\ncan find someplace safer for you to jump...maybe we should start  <br/>\nsaving up for a trampoline. In the meantime, how about open gym at  <br/>\nthe gymnastics club?&quot;). See the difference?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids often look to me for guidance when they&#39;re thinking about a  <br/>\nnew thing. &quot;Do you think I can climb that ladder, Mom?&quot; Eric might be  <br/>\nwondering if the people who own the place would allow it, or whether  <br/>\nI think it&#39;s safe. I help him evaluate the risk. &quot;Well, we can ask if  <br/>\nit&#39;s OK,&quot; or, &quot;Give it a try if you want, I&#39;ll spot you.&quot; He asked me  <br/>\nrecently about why people would want to get drunk--I talked to him  <br/>\nabout why people like it, and also about how I had never liked the  <br/>\nfeeling of being drunk, so I never have more than one drink anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways, it&#39;s a lot easier to just say &quot;No&quot;--kids should never  <br/>\njump on beds, 14-year-olds are never ever ever ready to have sex-- <br/>\nthan to engage with kids on all the complexities of these kinds of  <br/>\nissues. I think it might very well be true that most 14-year-olds are  <br/>\nnot fully ready to have sex. But saying &quot;No, you will not do it&quot;  <br/>\nshuts down dialogue between adults and children.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my primary goals as a parent is to preserve my relationship  <br/>\nwith my kids as loving, open, respectful and trusting. So I make  <br/>\nparenting decisions based not on the question of &quot;how can I get my  <br/>\nkid to comply with my request?&quot; but &quot;what can I do right now that  <br/>\nwill strengthen, rather than undermine, our relationship?&quot; I don&#39;t  <br/>\nhave a goal that my kid won&#39;t have sex at 14 or won&#39;t ever try drugs  <br/>\nor won&#39;t ever come home stinking drunk from a party he wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nsupposed to be at in the first place, although I would probably be  <br/>\npretty happy if none of those things happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a goal that when if he goes to that party at the frat house  <br/>\ndown the street with the three kegs on the front porch, he&#39;ll be able  <br/>\nto tell me that&#39;s where he&#39;s going. That when he&#39;s stinking drunk--if  <br/>\nhe ever is--he&#39;ll think home is a safe place to come to recover. That  <br/>\nif he&#39;s thinking about having sex at 14, he&#39;ll know that I&#39;m not  <br/>\ngoing to judge him for it, that even, if he needs to talk about that  <br/>\ndecision, or how he feels about it once it&#39;s happened, I could be a  <br/>\nperson he could come to. I have a goal that none of my kids will ever  <br/>\nsay to a friend, &quot;Oh, my god, I can&#39;t believe that just happened, my  <br/>\nmom will kill me if she finds out!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that &quot;anything goes.&quot; It&#39;s that life is life, and kids are  <br/>\nhuman beings, and human beings make choices and mistakes, and I want  <br/>\nto stay a valued part of my kids&#39; lives through all of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that attracted me to unschooling was listening to  <br/>\nKelly and Sandra and others talk about their relationships with their  <br/>\nteenagers. &quot;I want that,&quot; I thought, so I started hanging out and  <br/>\nlistening to them talk about how they got there. What they did when  <br/>\ntheir kids were 6 and 9 and 12. That&#39;s my goal--to have that kind of  <br/>\nrelationship with my human children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269152394,"authorName":"Lorrie","from":"Lorrie &lt;iamhisservant4ever@...&gt;","profile":"iamhisservant4ever","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"karen","postDate":"1181286747","msgId":24244,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY0Njc2NS43ODExMy5xbUB3ZWIzODUxMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24255,"prevInTime":24243,"nextInTime":24245,"topicId":24244,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Children who aren t told, no Stop don t never will trust you to be honest and open with them.
