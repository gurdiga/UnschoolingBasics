We never did baby talk. I<br/>\nnever rode around in the car with music blaring---we<br/>\nchatted about what we saw driving down the rode and<br/>\nshe learned stuff from me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh wow, we LOVE to do baby talk!  The boys and I come up with all sorts of<br/>\ngoofey and fun ways to talk to the baby and get his attention.  He gets<br/>\nbabas and binkys and does poo poos, he also hears things spoken<br/>\ncorrectly---most of the time.  The baby talk just makes things more silly<br/>\nand fun!  We always have music blaring, in the car, in the house.  We chat<br/>\nall the time too, and I spend a lot of time in the car turning the radio<br/>\ndown so we can talk as well.  It&#39;s all about having fun. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; We have lived a<br/>\nlife of revering books and knowledge, and watch tv for<br/>\nthe fun of history, PBS specials, technology stuff,<br/>\netc. We don&#39;t watch the junk on all the other<br/>\nchannels.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n I revere books and knowledge.  I hope my kids do as well, but that is for<br/>\nthem to decide.  We watch anything on TV that grabs our attention.  We&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen watching shows about the whole Da Vinci code stuff and the Knights<br/>\nTemplar and the Priory of Scion.  The TV is very often on the Food Network,<br/>\nmy boys love watching Alton Brown or George Duran.  They even watch the<br/>\nladies of the food network sometimes, too!  They love watching Extreme<br/>\nHomes, I Want That!, Design on a Dime--all sorts of informational stuff.  We<br/>\nwatch tons of Animal Planet, too!  We&#39;ve watched a lot of stuff lately on<br/>\nRome and the Roman Empire.  I usually put it on and get engrossed in it and<br/>\none by one the kids end up joining me.  We also have a blast watching The<br/>\nFairly Odd Parents, Sponge Bob, American Idol, Charmed various Anime shows<br/>\nand a whole bunch of other &quot;junk&quot; and you know what usually happens?  We<br/>\ntalk about what we&#39;ve watched.  Many times, we&#39;ll talk for a whole evening<br/>\nabout stuff we&#39;ve watched, whether educational or not.  It&#39;s about spending<br/>\ntime together and enjoying each other.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie:-)<br/>\n <br/>\nMother to Jessica-17, Stephen-16, Jeremy-14, Sean-10, Jaret-7 and Seamus-5<br/>\nmonths old<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
