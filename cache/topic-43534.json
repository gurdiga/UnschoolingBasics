The accommodations are perfect for<br/>\nfamilies as we will be taking over the building which holds the dining hall,<br/>\na fireplace, 3 sunny workrooms, a comfy loft with many couches and huge TV<br/>\nand a beautiful wraparound deck for sitting and enjoying your morning. We<br/>\nwill enjoy private, simple, spotless dormitory style rooms.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe camp has a beautiful lake and waterfront activities will be an option<br/>\nfor all of us to enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine three nights on a beautiful campus with hiking trails, abundant<br/>\nwildlife, simple & pleasant accommodations<br/>\n<br/>\nand 3 delicious catered family friendly meals prepared by our cherished<br/>\ncaterer!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe festivities begin on Monday afternoon with a welcome gathering and<br/>\nsnack.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe plan to offer massages by the minute on arrival day so that you can<br/>\ncompletely feel like you are *really* away on vacation!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will, once again, host 8 minute dating for families Monday evening<br/>\n(which everyone loved participating in!)- followed by delicious dinner and a<br/>\ncampfire.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTuesday and Wednesday will be a combination of planned and spontaneous<br/>\ngatherings for kids and parents. There will be a 24 hour gaming room,<br/>\ndesignated teen hangout, funshops on everything from firebuilding to Qi<br/>\nGong, unschooling lifeshops, discussion rings centered on peaceful<br/>\npartnerships, chances to deepen your exploration of unschooling while<br/>\nsharing meals and wide open spaces with other like-minded families, and<br/>\nopportunities to ask questions as you absorb the joy, at least for a few<br/>\ndays, of living in a little Unschooling Village.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be whole sections of the day for exploration and just being with<br/>\nour families- sort of an *unconference* feel. This year we are emphasizing<br/>\nthe retreat experience of Great Big Happy Life- use this time as a chance to<br/>\nboth reignite your unschooling spirit and reconnect with yourself and your<br/>\nchildren in a free and unbounded environment. Think of it as a chance to<br/>\ntake a really DEEP breath and EXHALE. Ahh�.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat Big Happy Life would like to extend our joyful invitation to ALL<br/>\npersons and families who would like to deepen their unschooling experience-<br/>\nWe strive to create a conference retreat that will embrace people of all<br/>\nsizes, colors, ethnic backgrounds, religious/spiritual choices, sexual<br/>\norientations, genders, abilities and cultures.
