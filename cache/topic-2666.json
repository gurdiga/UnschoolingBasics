He did get a warning<br/>\nfrom a police officer, who then called me, about him bein under age and<br/>\nsmoking in public. Here in VT you can buy cigerettes when you are 18.<br/>\nOut of my six kids, three daughters and three sons, 3 smoke (two<br/>\ndaughters and one son)and three don&#39;t. My husband and I smoked when we<br/>\nwere younger. We quit to be healthier and so our kids would be<br/>\nhealthier. One of my son&#39;s has allergies and my daughter had a premature<br/>\nbaby 4 months ago. We put restrictions around smoking around my son with<br/>\nallergies and our grandson. My mother died of cancer in 2000. She was a<br/>\nsmoker, an alcoholic, and refinished furniture for many years. She had a<br/>\nhard life and although she worked at understanding her circumstances,<br/>\ncontinued to have a hard life. She and my father divorced because he<br/>\nwanted to be with another woman. He was also a child molester. She then<br/>\nmarried an alcoholic. I think what I am working at saying is that I<br/>\nbelieve smoking has more to do with emotional problems than just<br/>\nexperimenting if it lasts for any length of time. I hope I don&#39;t get<br/>\nbeat on for saying that... My children that smoke seem to have more<br/>\nemotional difficulties than the ones who don&#39;t.
