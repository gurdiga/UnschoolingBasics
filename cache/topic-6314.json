She<br/>\nthought she got it but she never really trusted.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is stress-free for us.  But try telling other people that.  This<br/>\nis the time of year when everyone keeps asking the kids what grade they are<br/>\ngoing into and because they can never remember what grade they would be in<br/>\nage-wise, we end up getting into a discussion about homeschooling.  &quot;Oh, so<br/>\nwho is your teacher, your mom or dad?&quot;  I tried telling someone yesterday<br/>\nthat we all learn from each other, but they just didn&#39;t get it.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my point was, that when people hear that you homeschool, they get<br/>\nthis image in their head of some wonder-mom who just does it all.  I do do a<br/>\nlot for my kids but it all revolves around horses at this point.  It&#39;s a<br/>\npleasure for me to help them with their horses and not stressful or a chore<br/>\nto me at all.  Everyone seems to think it would be so hard to be a<br/>\nhomeschool mom when the truth is so far from that.  It&#39;s much easier to  be<br/>\na homeschool mom, living a stress-free unschooling life, then it ever would<br/>\nbe to try to live on the school schedule and enforce homework, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just love my life!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Stress Free Homeschooling","postDate":"1124903641","msgId":6314,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDNzc2RTY1QjMxNTdGMC1GODAtMUU4OUNATUJMSy1NMzUuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6333,"prevInTime":6313,"nextInTime":6315,"topicId":6314,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I got a flyer about a workshop coming up here in SC called Stree Free Homeschooling, and I couldn t help but think about our unschooling.
