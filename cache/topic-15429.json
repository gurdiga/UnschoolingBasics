They are, in fact, fully pre-cooked. (!)  Thanks<br/>\nfor bringing this fact to my attention, and my level of culinary expertise<br/>\nto this new all time high.   I&#39;ll feed them frozen to my son, with pleasure,<br/>\nfrom now on.  That was easy.    <br/>\n<br/>\n     I stopped coercing my son to brush his teeth.  I offered to help him<br/>\neach morning and evening for two days, and respected his wishes as he<br/>\npolitely declined to have them brushed.  On the third day, to my great<br/>\nsurprise (just as I was privately pondering how disgusting his mouth must<br/>\nhave been), he asked me, totally unprompted, to brush his teeth for him.<br/>\nHe then specified that he wants them brushed &quot;very slowly&quot;.  I asked him if<br/>\nI had been brushing them too fast in the past and he said yes.   I promised<br/>\nto do them slowly, and did.   Since then, I have been able to brush his<br/>\nteeth each morning and evening, and we remind each other, to ease his<br/>\nhesitation, that they should be brushed slowly.  It actually takes less time<br/>\nnow to brush them than in the past, if you include the pre-brushing struggle<br/>\nwe used to have with him.  <br/>\n<br/>\n     Thank you for all of your insightful responses, both practical and<br/>\nconceptual.  I appreciate your perspectives and experience.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCarolyn Valdivieso<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15399,"nextTopicId":15405}}
