An injection I<br/>\nreceived a few years back damaged my pancreas so surprise, surprise, I ended<br/>\nup diabetic. I ordered the lab tests myself since the doctors didn&#39;t request<br/>\nthe most important ones (HbA1C and C-peptide) and then went through 5<br/>\ninternists...had I listenedd to half of when they said, I&#39;d probably be dead<br/>\ntoday. I went to the American Diabetes association and stuck to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 1/27/07, Marieke Willis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:luuknam@...\">luuknam@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- Laura Beaudin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laura.beaudin@...\">laura.beaudin@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for pointing this out--your right, I haven&#39;t been able to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; info<br/>\n&gt; &gt; off the internet. Would you believe that I got this from my doctor?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes. In my experience, doctors are a good source of misinformation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what you get for listening to people in this country--my apologies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the bright side, you could sue him. :P In NL, the judges would laugh<br/>\n&gt; you away, you probably couldn&#39;t get this to be a court case, whereas<br/>\n&gt; here... who knows what would happen? Although I don&#39;t like stupid<br/>\n&gt; lawsuits... they just increase the cost of medical care.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Speaking of doctors and malinformation, I&#39;m currently reading &quot;The<br/>\n&gt; thinking woman&#39;s guide to a better birth&quot;, which is actually pretty<br/>\n&gt; well researched, despite the title. Some of the stuff in it really<br/>\n&gt; makes me roll my eyes, even though I was already very skeptical of<br/>\n&gt; hospital birth with all its interventions. It&#39;s a wonder obstetricians<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t get sued more often. Example: in around 1800, some doctor decided<br/>\n&gt; that the average length of a pregnancy is 40 weeks. Nowadays, doctors<br/>\n&gt; use that number to decide when to induce, which is quite often done at<br/>\n&gt; 41 weeks, although there are doctors that wait till 42 weeks. Still,<br/>\n&gt; turns out that the average length of a first time pregnancy is 41 weeks<br/>\n&gt; and a day, and for subsequent pregnancies 40 weeks and 3 days. So, the<br/>\n&gt; average first time mom is overdue and should be induced? Gimme a break.<br/>\n&gt; And I could obviously go on and on, but then I&#39;d be abusing Henci<br/>\n&gt; Goer&#39;s copyright, I think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Marieke<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t get soaked.
