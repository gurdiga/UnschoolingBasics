I want to reiterate what Robyn <br/>\nmentioned, about the important things in life if your child were to <br/>\ndie.<br/>\nI hate pulling this card, but a dear unschooler I know lost her <br/>\nchild almost two years ago. January will never be the same for me <br/>\nagain, because I think of the Wilkinsons and dear, sweet Sam every <br/>\nyear at that time. They were SO thankful that they spent every day <br/>\npursuing their interests, living free from &quot;shoulds&quot; and &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; <br/>\nand simply enjoying life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI KNOW that if myself or one of my wonderful children were to leave <br/>\ntheir journey here, I would never, ever regret one moment we spent <br/>\njust BEING. I often judge my life against the standard of death...it <br/>\nhelps me keep perspective clear on what is truly important. There <br/>\nare so many wonderful books to read, movies to watch, mountains to <br/>\nclimb, sunsets to watch, debates to have and hugs to give. Why would <br/>\nI waste one precious moment of my child&#39;s life assigning something <br/>\nto them? <br/>\nWhy would I assume that MY knowledge and my opinions on what <br/>\nconstitutes worthy information should be matched by my child?<br/>\nI won&#39;t waste their time and lives trying to tell them what I think <br/>\nthey should learn, I WILL however, spend every day learning with <br/>\nthem, about what is beautiful and worthy, and what is ugly and not <br/>\nworth repeating. We will learn because we love learning and we love <br/>\nliving life together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote something a long time ago, in response to the question &quot;what <br/>\ndo you hope your children will have gotten from unschooling by the <br/>\ntime they leave home?&quot; I&#39;m going to post my answer again, because <br/>\nit&#39;s a good reminder for ME and I think it fits in with the current <br/>\nconvo&#39;s so well:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was originally a post at unschooling dotcom email list: <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you hope your kids will have gotten from unschooling by the <br/>\ntime they&#39;re <br/>\nready to move on from home? <br/>\n<br/>\nRen&#39;s reply: <br/>\nMy main goal was that their sense of self would be so strongly <br/>\nintact that this world could not rob their joy, their uniqueness and <br/>\ntheir natural curiosity. <br/>\nBeyond that..... <br/>\nThat the status quo will not matter so much to them as what is good <br/>\nand right, that they would have a deep seated knowledge in their <br/>\nhearts that they are intelligent, <br/>\ncapable human beings and can learn anything they wish.  A sense of <br/>\nwonder so awesome that they will never quit seeing how magical the <br/>\nworld truly is.  Posses idealism tempered with realism. <br/>\nSpirituality which flows naturally and freely from a loving heart <br/>\nwhich contains kindness rare.  The ability to follow their dreams <br/>\nand acheive their <br/>\ngoals, whatever those may be. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how do you plan to help that along? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt humbles me to think about this.  I came out of High School <br/>\nbattered emotionally, not knowing who I was or what I realy wanted. <br/>\nAnd fifteen years later, here I am spouting off ideals for my <br/>\nchildren that I could not have dreamed of at the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI will help that along by becoming a better person myself. <br/>\nBy reading ,watching ,searching and regaining that sense of wonder, <br/>\nwhich my children have helped me with already. <br/>\nBy delving deep into questions and not pretending I know more than <br/>\nthem. <br/>\nBy being willing to set everything aside, change plans midstream and <br/>\ngo off in a new direction when necessary. <br/>\nBy listening carefully and responding appropriately. <br/>\nBy respecting thses amazing beings I&#39;ve been entrusted with and the <br/>\ninner knowledge they already possess. <br/>\nBy dialoguing with them, these matters of the heart and showing love <br/>\nto the earth and my fellow human beings. <br/>\nBy filling my home with books, movies, music, instruments, nature, <br/>\ntoys, art materials and whatever oddities my children bring home.<br/>\n <br/>\nBy taking them to the places they want to go and ones they never <br/>\nknew existed. By fixing them new and exciting foods from other <br/>\ncountries and making trips to the grocery store an adventure. <br/>\nBy making every day an adventure with my attitude, every mundane <br/>\nchore or daily activity sacred by how I approach it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHealing myself has definitely been the most important step in <br/>\nassisting these worthy individuals in their unschooling journey.  I <br/>\nhave learned much from them.<br/>\nThank the heavens they came here to teach me. <br/>\nRen 5/02 &quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3617,"nextTopicId":3601}}
