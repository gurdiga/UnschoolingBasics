It&#39;s okay to be taught if you want to<br/>\nbe taught and it may be hard but if it&#39;s something that YOU want to<br/>\nlearn and study for etc, it&#39;s okay you&#39;ll learn itand heck, even at<br/>\nWalmart they have the &quot;Cliff Notes&quot; series.  However, the other kind<br/>\nof teaching is unwanted and forced even for things you aren&#39;t<br/>\ninterested in.  The other thing...it doesn&#39;t take 12 years to learn<br/>\neven the required &#39;learning&#39; for SAT&#39;s and such, does it?  I mean that<br/>\na tutor or doing courses wouldn&#39;t take care of so long as we keep a<br/>\nportfolio later on down the road IF they should desire to go to college?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time I read a site (this was like a year ago) from an unschooled<br/>\nteen who said that she was upset that her mom never taught her math or<br/>\npushed it because now she has problems learning it. She blamed her mom<br/>\nfor not teaching her, I&#39;m guessing there is probably a deeper issue<br/>\nhere, and blamed her mom that she couldn&#39;t get into college because of<br/>\n&#39;pathetic&#39; math scores.  That bothers me because from what I<br/>\nunderstand (not know) college has many choices and you learn what you<br/>\nchoose to learn in college and take required classes that pertain to<br/>\nyour degree so WHY do they place emphasis on say &#39;grammar&#39; if your<br/>\nchild wants to go to college and major in history?

I can read a story and comprehend what it is all about<br/>\nwithout having to have it broken down into little parts for my scrutiny!  We<br/>\ncan learn to use alliteration without knowing it is alliteration.  We can<br/>\nuse similes and metaphors without knowing what those forms of writing are.<br/>\nWe use comparisons all the time and never thing, &quot;Ah, I am going to use a<br/>\nsimile now.&quot;  Has anyone truly ever benefitted from logically placing a<br/>\nmetaphor somewhere?

This is one of the first times that I&#39;ve ever seen<br/>\nhim be totally excited about something that was totally self-iniated<br/>\nby him outside of video games, he does things but has never really had<br/>\na passion.  His goal was set for the sole purpose of having a GED<br/>\ndiploma at the age of 12, how can I break this to him without ruining<br/>\nhis excitement?  He WANTS badly to play football in the fall and<br/>\ndreams of going to college in order to play football someday and has<br/>\neven went so far as to speak about it professionally.  Maybe I could<br/>\ngo from there and be encouraging regarding maybe the Pre-GED will help<br/>\nprepare him better for SAT/ACT&#39;s and such?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my fault as I was excited with Zak, I should&#39;ve found out this<br/>\ninfo beforehand and I didn&#39;t.  :-(  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12765,"nextTopicId":12687}}
