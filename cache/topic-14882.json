Lately, I <br/>\nhave been noticing that he&#39;s &quot;bored&quot; and wanting to have other kids to <br/>\nhang out with.  The problem is that those that he enjoys hanging out <br/>\nwith, I can only think of two or three, live a LONG ways away.  I am <br/>\ntrying to make arrangements to have them over for a few days, but that <br/>\ndoes take time to make happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the interest of stimulating my creativity can you PLEASE share with <br/>\nme how you help your children meet other people, especially fellow <br/>\nunschoolers.  The problem seems to be that most families actively <br/>\ninvolved in un/homeschooling groups have younger children.  Adrian <br/>\nlikes to hang out with mature kids his age or older.  I&#39;ve suggested a <br/>\nfew ideas, but no go.  Maybe someone on the outside of the forest can <br/>\ngive us a different perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks - Tina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14867,"nextTopicId":14883}}
