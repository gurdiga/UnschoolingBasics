(this <br/>\nmeans that mom does not know where his (whatever) is just like he <br/>\nwould not know where my (whatever) is but we will happily help each <br/>\nother look)<br/>\n<br/>\n If somthing gets left under dirty clothing and gets stepped on and <br/>\nbroken we feel badly for him and comfort him but he knows we can&#39;t <br/>\nrun out and buy a replacement because money is tight. if he <br/>\nmisplaces somthing and has a meltdown we comfort him and talk him <br/>\nthrough it. In either case we talk about what he thinks he needs to <br/>\nhelp him be better organised or ways he might be able to avoid the <br/>\nsame situation in the future and we try to help him in whatever way <br/>\nwe can. I still do his laundry if it is by the washing machiene <br/>\non &quot;wash day&quot; and he likes it folded and put in drawers and he does <br/>\nthat himself as long as I tell him his clothing is clean. I don&#39;t <br/>\nforce him to do this and sometimes he does not feel like doing them <br/>\nand leaves them in the basket but generaly he wants them folded and <br/>\nput up. <br/>\n<br/>\nmaybe thats odd maybe not. I dont know many 11 year old boys. <br/>\nD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ren Allen&quot; <br/>\n&lt;starsuncloud@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;My boys are going to know how to clean, wash clothes,<br/>\n&gt; dishes, etc.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why would you decide they have to know those things, but trust <br/>\n </span></blockquote>them <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to learn everything else in life by living?
