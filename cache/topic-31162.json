They don&#39;t see &quot;mess&quot; when they look at their toys.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s unrealistic to expect such young kids to have internalized your standard of and ideas about clean.   Even the nine year old.  He must seem pretty big and mature to you compared to the little ones.  But learning happens according to the learners schedule, not according to the frustrated dad&#39;s schedule. &lt;g.&gt;   If you can somehow change your expectation I think you&#39;ll feel less stress. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you change the way you see their toys and stuff?   Can you stop seeing it as &quot;mess&quot; and think of it as the physical manifestation of their joy and learning?  If you could look around and say to yourself, &quot;Wow, my kids have really had fun today!&quot;  instead of &quot;what a mess.&quot;  I think you could help yourself feel better.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAs with learning to read, you won&#39;t make your kids learn to be tidy by forcing tidy lessons or by stressing out over their lack of tidiness.&lt;g&gt;  As they get older and if they&#39;ve had your good example they will more and more see the value in taking care of their things.   You can&#39;t force that kind of learning any more than you can force going potty in the toilet instead of diapers or reading before a kid is ready. <br/>\n<br/>\n***So do I learn to walk over the mess or happily pick it up and if it is<br/>\ndestroyed stop buying more cause frankly it is starting to cost a lot.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWalk over the stuff they&#39;re still using and be glad you can give them something that makes them so happy.  Pick up the things they&#39;re finished with as a kindness, to help protect those things from getting broken or lost.  Ask for help but be ok with it if they don&#39;t help.  Someday they will help, really.   They&#39;re just not there yet.  You didn&#39;t get mad at them when they couldn&#39;t walk yet, right? When you had to carry them everywhere?  You just knew one day they&#39;d walk and your back would have it a little easier.&lt;g.&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you had a most beloved car and you left it parked on the street and it started to hail would you want your partner to run out and move it into the garage or just watch it get dented because you left it parked outside?<br/>\nIt&#39;s nice to help people.  It&#39;s nice to be helped.  Being helped is what lets us see the value in being helpful.  Every time you pick up toys for your kids you&#39;re helping them learn, your being a good person and you&#39;re making your little part of the world a happier place.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a bin or two for toys in each room.  I liked those Rubbermaid totes because they&#39;re really sturdy and have handles and were strong enough to double as kid perches.  They can be carried or shoved into different rooms as needed.   I hung bags for toys on door knobs.  That way I didn&#39;t have to make multiple trips to different rooms to put stuff away... it just went into the nearest bin or bag.    We kept a couple of little boxes for teeny things, parts to other things, so they were easier to find.  We made more storage space available in the rooms most often played in.  We cleared off a couple of shelves to make room for toys.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it mostly toys making up the &quot;mess?&quot;  If it&#39;s more than toys can you hire a housekeeper one day a week.  That way you&#39;d know the big stuff would get done no matter how many toys were out.   Could you dedicate one day a week to housekeeping?  Could you take the kids out of the house one day a week, swimming or something, so your partner could clean?   <br/>\n<br/>\n***I am not sure what I am really feeling from my kids right now but<br/>\nI have been out of town for three days and I think I must have thought the<br/>\nbreak would create a new out look when I returned but I still have feelings<br/>\nof discontent.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWere you hoping to come home to a clean house as a kind of &quot;welcome home, we missed you,  we tried to make things comfortable for you after your trip&quot; and were disappointed to find the same old place?  Did it leave you feeling unimportant that there was nothing special waiting for you on your return?  Did it seem like it didn&#39;t make any difference whether you were there or not?  That&#39;s probably not a kid issue.   The kids are still young enough they wouldn&#39;t have thought about what you might need to feel welcomed and loved.   It&#39;s not because they don&#39;t love you or didn&#39;t miss you, they&#39;re just very young.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a need to come home to a peaceful tidy place after you&#39;ve been traveling, let your partner know that.  Maybe it&#39;s too much for one person to tidy up a house lived in by five, but if you make your partner aware of your need the two of you might be able to come up with ideas for better meeting that need.   If you felt unappreciated or unloved when you got home let your partner know that too.  It was probably just wildly busy being the one parent home with three energetic boys.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332644129,"authorName":"Stacey","from":"&quot;Stacey&quot; &lt;alabtu@...&gt;","profile":"cosmbo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Feeling unrespected","postDate":"1206284258","msgId":31201,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZzNXI1Mis1MnJnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwOTgwMWM4OGNlZiRlZGEzM2UzMCQwMjAxYThjMEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4="},"prevInTopic":31200,"nextInTopic":31204,"prevInTime":31200,"nextInTime":31202,"topicId":31162,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"okay, i m just going to say this and sorry if it offends anyone, etc. i ve said this on a positive parenting board, and set off a really hot","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-117034111\">okay, i&#39;m just going to say this and sorry if it &#39;offends&#39; anyone, <br/>\netc. i&#39;ve said this on a &#39;positive parenting&#39; board, and set off <br/>\na &#39;really&#39; hot topic!!???-but i &#39;still&#39; don&#39;t see why??<br/>\n<br/>\nbasically, i am the person that picks up the toys. i can &#39;ask&#39; my <br/>\nkids to pick up, and when they &#39;remember&#39;, they do get real proud of <br/>\nthemselves.  story-welcome to the house of ADD, i have it. my husband <br/>\nhas it. my oldest child has it.  younger ones??? too young to know. <br/>\nour motivational level is near 0!!  (unless we just &#39;get that urge&#39;;)<br/>\nfor me, there has to be a reward at the other end.  dishes pile up <br/>\nthroughout the day and i do them at night. why?  because no <br/>\none &#39;bothers&#39; me then, and i can get them done in 10 minutes flat.  <br/>\notherwise, i&#39;m constantly interrupted!!  picking up toys is the <br/>\nsame.  i (or if i have the kids, it&#39;s the same) pick up in sections. <br/>\nfor example, the past few days i have computer game i like to play. i <br/>\ncan&#39;t say i&#39;m very good at it;) so the games are quite short. but i <br/>\nplayed a game. when that game was done, i picked up the toys in the <br/>\nlivingroom (we have a toybox in the living room).  then i played a <br/>\ngame.  then i vacuamed, like a corner of the the room (it was pretty <br/>\nbad) and then when that goal was met, i vacuamed a little more till i <br/>\ngot bored/motivation was gone!) then played another game (as a <br/>\nreward) anyways, after going back and forth, i eventually had the <br/>\nroom cleaned.  went to the dishes, one sink load (play game) and go <br/>\nback and forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe same works for kids.  pick up this, 5 min on computer.  also you <br/>\ncan do, watch a show. oh, commercials!!! quick, pick up these toys <br/>\nfast (turn off tv.  goal of this &#39;game&#39; is to pick up the arm load of <br/>\ntoys fast, &#39;race&#39; them to the room, put away and come back before the <br/>\nshow starts again. can you do it????? ready, set, go!) yes, they will <br/>\nbe running the the house...but, they have a goal, and in the end it <br/>\nworks.<br/>\n<br/>\ni know...i&#39;m not sitting down and explaining to them we all need <br/>\nto &#39;sit down and work as a family&#39;. fact is, in our house, that is <br/>\nnot a motivation.  if i don&#39;t see a reward, me, as a parent, am not <br/>\ninterested!!

We just moved to<br/>\nanother home this past Friday, and I have boxes *everywhere* right now.  I<br/>\nknow in a *logical* sense that it will not be a big job to slowly go, room<br/>\nby room, and put the contents of the boxes where they belong.  But I find<br/>\nmyself completely ignoring the boxes and doing other things - it&#39;s much too<br/>\n*emotionally* overwhelming.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI usually tidy up after my boys (ages 8.5 and 4.5) without comment, knowing<br/>\nthat I do it because *I* want it cleaned up, it makes *me* feel good.  But<br/>\nif I would like their help, or if they are wanting to clean a space (usually<br/>\nbecause they want to put on a show or build a special project there), I<br/>\nalways help them tackle the job step by step.  &quot;Here, let&#39;s first do all the<br/>\ntrain tracks, and they go in this box.&quot;  Then once the train tracks are<br/>\nfinished, we move on to cars, or Legos, etc.  But I am with them throughout<br/>\nthe steps, breaking it down with them in little snippets of cleaning.  Yes,<br/>\nthis takes longer than just saying &quot;Okay everybody clean up!&quot;.  But it<br/>\nresults in no tears, a great connection between us, and a very empowering<br/>\nfeeling for the boys that they accomplished this huge job without feeling<br/>\nicky about it.

I try not to take it personally when my <br/>\nboys (ages 5 and 2 and a half) leave toys all over the place -- after all, I <br/>\nLOVE and encourage their creativity, etc. - but it does feel like an insult <br/>\nto me and my hard work! However, I realize that&#39;s my issue, not there <br/>\nintent.<br/>\n<br/>\nNevertheless, there comes a time and a place when things have to get cleaned <br/>\nup. So, to that end, being a &quot;reformed clutterer&quot; myself who married a tidy <br/>\nguy, my plan of attack is something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\na) Have a home for each toy. A bin, a basket, a shelf. (You might want to <br/>\njust figure this out on your own one day if you are the one &quot;in charge&quot; of <br/>\nthe cleaning up.)<br/>\n<br/>\nb) Let the kids see where the home for everything is.<br/>\n<br/>\nc) When things get messy, point out what needs to be cleaned up, and how, <br/>\nand set a timer. I say to my 5-year-old: &quot;Your cars need to go in this <br/>\nbasked; your street pieces go in this bin; these books go in the shelf over <br/>\nthere - now, Go! Timer&#39;s running!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nd) The last part of this is that, before we get started, I bring in a big <br/>\ntupperware bin, and I say, whatever isn&#39;t cleaned up when the timer beeps <br/>\nneeds to go into this bin and will get stored in the attic. Why? Not as a <br/>\npunishement, but simply because we need to neaten up the house. That&#39;s all. <br/>\n(Usually this all happens shortly before guests come over! ) What has ended <br/>\nup happening is that things get cleaned up before the timer beeps, whatever <br/>\nthey don&#39;t need gets put into the bin (my boys decide themselves what to <br/>\nstore away!), and nobody has yelled or screamed or been brought to tears or <br/>\ndisrespected. The attic toys sit out of sight and out of mind and get <br/>\nforgotten about; some I just toss or give away eventually; others return <br/>\ndownstairs after a hiatus; others the kids decide what should stay and what <br/>\nshould go. I couldn&#39;t just say &quot;Anything that is not cleaned up by the time <br/>\nthe timer beeps will get tossed in the trash!&quot; because that just seems <br/>\ndisrespectful to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m hoping in future years this evolves into they clean up by themselves, <br/>\nand stuff that goes in the Tupperware bin can be sent off to Goodwill etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout this, my younger son helps out by imitating what my older son <br/>\ndoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring this time, I do &quot;mommy&#39;s housework&quot; - put dishes away, etc. -- that <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t old enough to do yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ariana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;John Buxcel&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnbuxcel@...\">johnbuxcel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 20, 2008 7:42 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Feeling unrespected<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello all I am not sure what I am really feeling from my kids right now <br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; I have been out of town for three days and I think I must have thought the<br/>\n&gt; break would create a new out look when I returned but I still have <br/>\n&gt; feelings<br/>\n&gt; of discontent.
