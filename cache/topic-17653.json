At the time of the <br/>\nadoption they were 5, 8 & 11 and had been in foster care for four <br/>\nyears. These were children that had NO freedom and NO choice in <br/>\ntheir lives.

It was a process <br/>\ngetting here...I started by saying yes more and more, talking with <br/>\nher about the choices she was making and answering any questions <br/>\nthat she had honestly. My feeling is...if they&#39;re never given a <br/>\nchoice, how can they choose what&#39;s right? <br/>\n<br/>\nI blog about our lives and our journey if you&#39;re interested.

The  <br/>\nradical unschooling DOES work, as long as the parent&#39;s are involved  <br/>\nand loving parts of the child&#39;s life. When I&#39;m distracted, the little  <br/>\nones have only one way to get my attention. I don&#39;t even see it as  <br/>\nrunning wild, it&#39;s a desperate call for attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one thing that was pointed out to me (over and over until I  <br/>\ngot it) was that WHY do people assume the worst? If I don&#39;t *make* my  <br/>\nkids feed the animals, they would just LET THEM STARVE. If I don&#39;t  <br/>\n*make* them clean their rooms, they would get so dirty WE&#39;D HAVE  <br/>\nROACHES AND RATS eating out of them. Well, my arguments to those  <br/>\nwould be, why would your kids let the animals starve? Because they  <br/>\nare &#39;malicious little brats&#39; (which seems to be mainstreamers view),  <br/>\nor because they are still young enough they need reminders/assistance/ <br/>\nencouragement? I&#39;ve seen my children forget over and over to feed the  <br/>\nanimals, but when we sat down to dinner, they remembered that their  <br/>\nanimal friends might be hungry too. Or just me asking when they were  <br/>\nfed last (because I wanted to know and do it myself, not to be nasty  <br/>\nand try to get them to do it) We&#39;re partners in the house, not  <br/>\ndominator and subjects. Same for their rooms. Cleaning is important  <br/>\nto me, but really, what&#39;s in it for the kids? Not much really, all it  <br/>\nmeans is to take time out of their play to put away the reminders of  <br/>\nfun they&#39;ve had. When I clean their rooms as a gift, as a clean slate  <br/>\nfor them to start their fun anew, it&#39;s an example to them of how it  <br/>\ncan be okay. And about half the time, they join in because they want  <br/>\nto. When guests are coming over, and I say &quot;Guy&#39;s, so-n-so will be  <br/>\nhere soon, and I really need your help tidying rooms x, y, z, can you  <br/>\nhelp?&quot; they jump on it because cleaning doesn&#39;t have the unpleasant  <br/>\nassociations that it probably does for most of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gotta go, i&#39;m sure there was more to say, but I&#39;ve got a 5yo and  <br/>\n3yo who need me to throw them on the bed to jump. :-) My parents  <br/>\nmight say that they run wild, but really, what&#39;s the harm in it?<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (9), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (5), Dan  <br/>\n(3), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sep 28, 2006, at 10:13 PM, Vickisue Gray wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; So I would like to hear some<br/>\n&gt; experiences of the effects of freedom on children, some opinions about<br/>\n&gt; why it is that this freedom works for and not against us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] research","postDate":"1159528872","msgId":17657,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMxNDhEN0Q2LUVEQjktNDgzQy04QkU5LTBFRTUxNEM3N0I1QUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVmaHNkaytycWljQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVmaHNkaytycWljQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17654,"nextInTopic":17663,"prevInTime":17656,"nextInTime":17658,"topicId":17653,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;m new to the group so should probably keep my mouth shut.  I guess I actually do a combination of styles, mostly unschooling, but with my son (8) it&#39;s easy.  We started this year (first official full year of HS) trying to follow the pre-printed guidelines.  Lol, that lasted like....not even a day?  Who wants to be chained to a desk for even one hour let alone four plus?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I say my son&#39;s easy because he reads at a very high level.  His vocabulary is large.  He&#39;s one of those kids, that if you explain it right, gets it.  I love books so the house has always been filled with them. Recently, I find that to answer his questions, my A&P books from college are being pulled out. Glad I kept them.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Now, as for the &quot;let them do whatever they want&quot;....hummmm.<br/>\n  We live on a farm, so it has never been quite like that.  Life has choices.  Don&#39;t feed the pets, the pets die.  Choice would fall more to WHEN to feed the pets, not IF.  Never love your pony, don&#39;t get made when she doesn&#39;t want to come to you.  (Happy to report all the pets are happy and well loved.)  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  School for us has fallen into the same mode.  Surprisingly, my son&#39;s weakest subject, writing, has blossomed taking this approach.  Instead of having him do the pre-scripted copy work he has no interest in, I just suggest he add a new chapter to his novel as I can&#39;t wait to hear what happens next.  This technic is actually creating a novel!  Well, that&#39;s my story.
