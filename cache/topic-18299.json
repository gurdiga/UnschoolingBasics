I just posted a chunk of books that I picked up around the house <br/>\nand van that Sorscha (8) has been reading. The reading levels range <br/>\nthe gambit from encyclopedias to preschool. If you want to check it <br/>\nout it is the first post on my blog right now. Oh, and Sorscha <br/>\nhas &#39;collections&#39; of books from a series. For example: Magic Tree <br/>\nHouse, Secrets of Droon, and Warriors. She loves to read those over <br/>\nand over. Her journey with reading is just about enjoying what she is <br/>\nreading...not because it is a certain age level. Reading Levels do not <br/>\nmatter when your not in school. Also..I find it interesting that they <br/>\ndo not even post reading levels after 5th grade on books. Wonder why <br/>\nif they are so important??? If you really want to twist it around I <br/>\nguess someone could say to Sorscha that reading an encyclopedia is <br/>\nabove her age level and that&#39;s a bad thing. Whenever someone says <br/>\nsomething that bugs me I try and twist it the other way.

I just posted a chunk of books that I picked up around the house <br/>\nand van that Sorscha (8) has been reading.  The reading levels range <br/>\nthe gambit from encyclopedias to preschool.  If you want to check it <br/>\nout it is the first post on my blog right now.  Oh, and Sorscha <br/>\nhas &#39;collections&#39; of books from a series.  For example: Magic Tree <br/>\nHouse, Secrets of Droon, and Warriors.  She loves to read those over <br/>\nand over.  Her journey with reading is just about enjoying what she is <br/>\nreading...not because it is a certain age level.  Reading Levels do not <br/>\nmatter when your not in school.  Also..I find it interesting that they <br/>\ndo not even post reading levels after 5th grade on books.  Wonder why <br/>\nif they are so important???
