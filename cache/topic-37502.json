He watched as the returns came in, debated with other gamers over<br/>\nwho should/would win, and woke me up at 1AM to tell me that Obama had taken<br/>\nit.

I can not stress how much he loves games. Well anyway to make a long story short, one day out of the blue he says &quot;Mom, going to sleep helps to restore your health doesn&#39;t it?&quot; I looked at him in a bit of a shock because this came out of the blue and I said &quot;Yes son, sleeping does help your health tremendously.&quot; Then I said &quot;How do you know that because we have not discussed this before?&quot; and he looks at me like I am the crazy one and says &quot; My video games, when I am sick or my health is low, my game tells me to sleep to restore my health!&quot; HAHA I was like &quot;WHAT??&quot; I could not believe it! My son was successfully unschooled on something and learned something BIG!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHAHA!! I LOVE unschooling!!!!!!
