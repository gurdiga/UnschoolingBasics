He doesn&#39;t have <br/>\nvery many skills yet - even though I&#39;m sure he seems to have more all <br/>\nthe time, he&#39;s still pretty little. So going for a face is an <br/>\nattractive way to communicate because its effective. It get someone&#39;s <br/>\nattention and gets a response. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince he&#39;s drawn to faces in this way, you might want to create some <br/>\nspecial games or ways to play together that are all about faces. Can <br/>\nhe stroke your face? Is there something he can rub on your face, like <br/>\nlotion - lanolin maybe (nice and safe around the eyes)? Brushing your <br/>\nhair might be good, too. That might help to &quot;fill him up&quot; so he&#39;s <br/>\nable to explore other ways of communicating.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I try to intervene whenever I see that &quot;look&quot; when he&#39;s interacting <br/>\n </span></blockquote>with <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; someone else,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Great!

Its totally possible that - Right Now - once he starts an <br/>\naction he can&#39;t stop it even if he wanted to. That&#39;s not something <br/>\nyou can solve quickly, its a developmental issue. You can help by <br/>\nfinding ways for him to use his hands delicately and gently so that <br/>\nhe builds up some better control over his body, but there&#39;s no <br/>\novernight fix.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Lately the thing we have been mostly doing is saying &quot;______ doesnt <br/>\n </span></blockquote>like <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; OW&#39;s&quot; and then talking about other things said person DOES like, Hi-<br/>\n </span></blockquote>5&#39;s, tickles, and other <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; physical things which are fun for him to do.

He has reached <br/>\na point where it is more the gesture than the actual hurting. It used to be a combination of <br/>\nscratching and hitting usually on the face. I came to RU boards for advice when this <br/>\nstarted and was told to say &quot;OW&quot; (thus where he got it from). And things like &quot;that hurts&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;I dont like being hurt&quot;. This was probably getting close to a year ago when it started. <br/>\nBut now he kind of just says OW and hits your face, but doesnt (usually!) actually hurt me <br/>\nor whoever it is. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have found there are many motivations behind it. Sometimes its anger, like another child <br/>\nsteals something he had or wont hand over something he wants for example). A lot of <br/>\ntimes its a need to physically connect with someone. And often its just a physical <br/>\nboisterous kind of release. More rarely its about attention. And other times its kind of hard <br/>\nto work out what prompted it but have ruled out the others. <br/>\n<br/>\nObviously just saying that hurts etc hasnt been working for us. I have tried A LOT of <br/>\nthings, all the while trying to maintain respect for my son the whole time. I have given him <br/>\nlots of indoor physical toys to give him an outlet for that (like hammer pegs- sword <br/>\nfighting etc). I try to intervene whenever I see that &quot;look&quot; when he&#39;s interacting with <br/>\nsomeone else, but he tends to then redirect it at me and apart from physically holding <br/>\nboth hands back (which upsets him/makes him madder) I havent found a way to stop it in <br/>\nthe moment. Lately the thing we have been mostly doing is saying &quot;______ doesnt like <br/>\nOW&#39;s&quot; and then talking about other things said person DOES like, Hi-5&#39;s, tickles, and other <br/>\nphysical things which are fun for him to do. It sometimes works after the first OW and <br/>\nchanges his mood. Sometimes the only thing which &#39;works&#39; is just removing him. <br/>\n<br/>\nIm at my wits end with the whole thing. Am I handling things &quot;right&quot;? Is there any other <br/>\nthings people could suggest for stopping it before it happens or immediately after. Its <br/>\nmostly pretty hard to know when he is going to do it because even if he has a reason for it, <br/>\nits within him until released in the OW- if that makes sense. Just looking for some ideas <br/>\non this as it is reaching the point where even Im starting to think he needs some more <br/>\n&#39;discipline&#39;. I&#39;ve thought of doing something like a time in, as in I would pick him up and <br/>\nremove him from the room immediately, but I see no way that this would have any effect <br/>\nas he is always with me anyway. And how does it &#39;teach&#39; anything unless I attached a rule <br/>\nto it that he couldnt go back or lectured him on what he did or something, neither of <br/>\nwhich seems right to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLogan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24709,"nextTopicId":37437}}
