Social situations can be naturally corrective or not, we can&#39;t <br/>\nalways predict. And while there are ways we can gently intervene without <br/>\nthwarting the natural learning moment between peers as a way of <br/>\nmitigating potentially painful natural consequences, I personally think <br/>\nit&#39;s important to do so in a way the preserves the peer relations. Kind <br/>\nof like the police being called into a domestic dispute and both parties <br/>\nturning on the police, kwim? I try to step in with the role of mediator <br/>\nand facilitator rather than authority if that makes any sense because I <br/>\nfeel I can help without detracting or disempowering.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s a tired mantra, but I feel that if I keep empowerment as my <br/>\ngoal, then I tend to approach things in a way that&#39;s more conducive to <br/>\nhelping my kids find their own paths while simultaneously being able to <br/>\nhelp avoid or at least diminish painful consequences.
