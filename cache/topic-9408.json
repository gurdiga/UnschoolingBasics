So in a sense there is no regret, only learning.<br/>\nFocus on the joy of today. Focus on what a perfect, whole and<br/>\nwonderful child you have and how to make his world bigger and brighter<br/>\ntoday.<br/>\nMaybe today you will simply help him with his chores, maybe you won&#39;t<br/>\nmention them, but do them for him and ask for his help sweetly.<br/>\n<br/>\nA better life is built around better days, and better days are built<br/>\naround making a better choice right now. That&#39;s all. So simple and so<br/>\ndifficult (only because we make it difficult) at the same time.
