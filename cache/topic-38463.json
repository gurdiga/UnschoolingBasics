What Unschooling looks like was: To censor or not to censor? that is<br/>\n    Posted by: &quot;Danielle Conger&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danielle.conger@...\">danielle.conger@...</a> danielleconger<br/>\n    Date: Tue Feb 24, 2009 7:05 am ((PST))<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were so many really great responses to this thread when I turned <br/>\non my computer this morning. I changed the subject line because it seems <br/>\nto me that we&#39;re going in multiple useful directions, and it may be <br/>\nworth following each path in its own space.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m taking the quotes below out of order because reversing them makes <br/>\nthe most sense to me in terms of my answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrignial Poster wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  How to reach the result you are hoping for- whether it be connection, meeting <br/>\n </span></blockquote>everyones needs in the moment, better understanding your childs POV, whatever <br/>\nthe hope is for the outcome of the moment. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>By doing it. More and more. By learning from your successes and your <br/>\nfailures because they will all teach you something about yourself and <br/>\nabout your child(ren). And I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an end to the <br/>\njourney--the whole thing is a process. It&#39;s not like you arrive one day <br/>\nand are &quot;there&quot;--where ever there may be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I for one would love more CONCRETE examples of how you handle specific <br/>\n </span></blockquote>t<br/>\nhings in each instant. Its one thing to say &quot;we live by such and such instead <br/>\nand I try to make sure my child feels X instead&quot; but that really doesnt help <br/>\nsomeone learn how to do &#39;such and such&#39;. Like when people say unschooling is not <br/>\nletting your kid do whatever they want you need to have conversations and dialog <br/>\nand guidance. But *HOW* do you fit all of that in *before* your child has done <br/>\nwhatever it is that you thought they needed more information about? How do you <br/>\nsay it without them learning to tune it out or sounding like nagging? How do you <br/>\ntell your child, for example after hitting their brother, that it isnt okay to <br/>\nhit, without belittling them and shaming them? Its all fine to say things like <br/>\nstop the hitting in the first place, but that isnt life and reality all of the <br/>\ntime. And people need real examples for real life<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  when things do happen which we didnt intend on.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is why we always ask folks to bring specific examples with specific <br/>\ndetails to the list, because it is sooo hard to try to *show* how a <br/>\nsimilar scenario might have played out in our house if we don&#39;t have <br/>\nthose examples to go on.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, and I think for many unschoolers, every single detail matters, <br/>\nthe context matters. How I respond to my kids depends entirely upon <br/>\ncontext, which is why being there is so important. If I&#39;m present and <br/>\naware of what&#39;s going on, what the dynamics are, what the kids are <br/>\ntrying to do, why they&#39;re trying to d<br/>\no it, what lead up to it, etc. then <br/>\nI&#39;m better able to respond in a constructive way that addresses all <br/>\ntheir needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Having said that, there is still a lot about unschooling that I dont get. Like <br/>\n </span></blockquote>when the &#39;veterans&#39; say things which seem to contradict in every way. To give an <br/>\nexample.... a parent doesnt want to spend X amount of money on something their <br/>\nchild wants, for whatever reason. Unschoolers all jump on saying &quot;why not&quot; and <br/>\nwhen the person explains why not the unschoolers say &quot;we didnt mean we buy our <br/>\nkids everything, BUT....&quot; And in the end I (and possibly the original poster) am <br/>\nleft wondering what the actual answers meant. Can I say no if I have a good <br/>\nreason? What reason is good enough? If I say no am I being a &#39;bad unschooler&#39; <br/>\neven with a good reason? This is not something I need help on, just trying to <br/>\ngive an example.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought this was such a great example for me because the way you put <br/>\nit here made me have my own aha! moment in terms of how I want to be <br/>\nexplaining things. I know much of this has been said in the archives, <br/>\nbut I think that&#39;s the trick sometimes with these lists: those posting <br/>\nregularly have a sense of history that those coming new to the list <br/>\ndon&#39;t have. Of course they haven&#39;t read all of the archives, so it&#39;s <br/>\nimportant for those of us who have been posting a long time to keep that <br/>\nin mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course it&#39;s &quot;okay&quot; to say no, and I think our kids need to know how <br/>\nto say=2<br/>\n0no as well. But the question is really more than that--or maybe <br/>\nit&#39;s just that my answer would be more than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not so much whether to say no or not, but what are the *affects* of <br/>\nsaying no, what does the word no *accomplish*? No is waaay overused in <br/>\nmainstream parenting culture. I think we&#39;d all agree on that, so the <br/>\nfirst step, I think, is just not using it nearly as often. The whole <br/>\nfind a way to say yes instead. No should really be reserved for those <br/>\ndire moments where someone or something is about to suffer. But there&#39;s <br/>\nmore than that, and unschooling parents are willing to go deeper than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo can really shut down a conversation rather than opening it up to the <br/>\nnumerous possibilities beyond no. So for problem solving to really take <br/>\nroot, I think the &quot;no&quot; needs to be left out because no doesn&#39;t usually <br/>\nmean just no. More often it means, &quot;I&#39;m tired,&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nclean up the mess,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m afraid someone will get hurt,&quot; or &quot;we need <br/>\nto have other priorities right now,&quot; or.... there are loads of other <br/>\npossibilities. Problem solving starts by getting at what&#39;s *behind* the <br/>\nno, and that requires internal work on the parents&#39; part. I talked about <br/>\na lot of this at the St. Louis Live & Learn conference--how to rework <br/>\nand reframe the no in your own mind before it even pops out of your head.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you say here is so spot on in this regard:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Because I discovered it early I thought it would come easy. However20I didnt <br/>\n </span></blockquote>realize how much I would still need to deschool myself with each new stage of my <br/>\nsons development. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is waaaay more about the parents in a lot of ways than it is <br/>\nabout the kids. The kids are who they are. Especially always unschooled <br/>\nkids--they&#39;re already whole. Our job is to try to keep it that way!<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is a life-changing journey for so many parents because it <br/>\nrequires so much internal work. We have to unlearn many, many things, <br/>\nespecially those of us who don&#39;t come from peaceful or gentle parenting <br/>\nhouseholds, as Maisha was pointing out. Many of us have no models, but <br/>\nkudos to all of us for seeking them out and being willing to take these <br/>\nbrave steps into the unknown. Meredith talks about feeling &quot;raw&quot; <br/>\nsometimes when folks are new to the list and hear difficult responses, <br/>\nbut I think really it&#39;s the unschooling, the personal work and the <br/>\nremaking of our psyche that&#39;s the root cause of that rawness, that <br/>\nfeeling of being so exposed and vulnerable because we&#39;re dismantling all <br/>\nof our emotional and psychological framework. That&#39;s hard, hard work!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at any rate, to get back to my point...<br/>\n<br/>\nNo isn&#39;t the problem. The problem, as I see it, is that the &quot;no&quot; not <br/>\nonly gets in the way of our relationship with our kids, but it also gets <br/>\nin the way of our relationship with ourselves. No is knee-jerk, and it&#39;s <br/>\nvague, and it&#39;s inaccurate most of the time. It&#39;s a linguistic veil that <br/>\nprevents us from knowing our au<br/>\nthentic selves and from being able to <br/>\nshare that self with our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we can leave &quot;no&quot; behind and move directly into the communication <br/>\nabout our needs, that&#39;s where the problem solving begins.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, in my family, that is what unschooling looks like. That&#39;s what I <br/>\nmean when I say that &quot;yes&quot; needs to come from an authentic and genuine <br/>\nplace or it&#39;s unsustainable, and mom or dad just end up feeling bowled <br/>\nover and resentful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, unschooling, I would say, is beyond yes or no, and more about <br/>\nauthentic communication and dialog and finding solutions that meet <br/>\neveryone&#39;s needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s important to be able to talk about that philosophically and <br/>\ntheoretically because those are the general principles and ideas that <br/>\npeople can then import into their own families and their own lives. But <br/>\nit&#39;s also important to try to demonstrate what that process might look <br/>\nlike in any given concrete scenario. This is why it&#39;s so useful to see <br/>\nunschooling families in action.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of unschoolers who know me and know my kids. They *know* <br/>\nthat what we do looks nothing like &quot;anything goes.&quot; My girls are so <br/>\nsweet and easy and helpful, and Sam is, too, much of the time. Much more <br/>\nof the time with every passing year. But he&#39;s also a really intense kid <br/>\nand really explosive in that intensity, so we work a lot together in <br/>\nterms of limits and boundaries of his actions and the way they impact <br/>\nothers. My goal has been to support him in his journey learning about =0<br/>\nAhis intense emotions, to help him embrace that intensity as a beautiful <br/>\npart of himself, but also how to harness that energy and how to find <br/>\ncoping mechanisms and tools to help him through the explosive side of <br/>\nthat intensity without causing harm to himself or others or to his <br/>\nrelationships. Those are really tough, tough things to learn, but he <br/>\namazes me every day with the depth of his passion and the depth of his <br/>\nself knowledge, and he is my teacher every single blessed day of our <br/>\nlives together. (and yes, I have tears in my eyes while typing this.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who has seen us in action knows that I&#39;m not usually very far <br/>\naway, and that even as he gets older and more capable, I&#39;m still <br/>\nconstantly checking in, making sure he&#39;s okay and in a good space.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was younger there were many, many times that I had to step in, <br/>\nand not all of those moments were successes, but each and every one of <br/>\nthem taught us something about ourselves and about our relationship. <br/>\nI&#39;ve preserved a lot of my older posts about Sam at my spirited child <br/>\npage because I think it&#39;s so hard to recapture that in the moment <br/>\nfeeling when we&#39;re talking in hindsight.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen has a really spirited young guy, too, and we&#39;ve had our families <br/>\ntogether a few times, and it&#39;s always interesting to see how Sam and <br/>\nJalen interact. Ren and I aren&#39;t on the sidelines thinking anything <br/>\ngoes; we&#39;re right there, ready to jump in and help negotiate as we see <br/>\nthings start to escalate.20There was one visit where things turned ugly <br/>\nreally quickly, and there was most definitely a no in there. Sam and I <br/>\nwent and sat in the van. He was really mad and spouting that anger. He <br/>\nwanted to leave right then. I sat with him and listened to him and <br/>\ntrusted him in his process. And he moved through the anger, and everyone <br/>\nwas safe, and he was ready to rejoin the fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what the process has looked like for us over and over again. <br/>\nDoing as much as possible to create an environment where Sam can be the <br/>\nbest self he can be, and when that breaks down, I step in quickly to <br/>\nkeep everyone safe, help Sam get to a quiet and safe space where he can <br/>\nprocess his intense emotions, listen, be present, be calm, and help him <br/>\nas much as possible until he feels ready to rejoin the action.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Personally I have the &quot;is it okay to..&quot; and the &quot;is that unschooly?..&quot; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>questions A LOT. A lot more than I ever post here because I can understand it <br/>\nmay be annoying if one person kept coming to ask that for every little thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease always feel welcome to bring questions to this list. It&#39;s why it <br/>\nexists.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Unless something is described in just the right way, or with enough complete <br/>\n </span></blockquote>angles, I find it EXTREMELY difficult to move on with any sort of closure to <br/>\nthat topic. Without closure I cant cement that idea in my mind and use that as a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  balancing beam when the same thing comes up with my children.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is why it&#39;s so <br/>\ngreat to have so many different voices because <br/>\npeople learn in so many different ways. What works for one person, won&#39;t <br/>\nnecessarily work for the next. And sometimes all we can do is plant the <br/>\nseeds of ideas that will germinate in people&#39;s minds, waiting for the <br/>\nright moment in *their* lives that will suddenly make it all click.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (11), Julia (10), Sam (8)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com\">http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38456,"nextTopicId":38467}}
