Since he doesn&#39;t have any other friends in the <br/>\narea its nice he met someone close, BUT I don&#39;t like the father. The <br/>\nlittle girl lives with her father (who apparently is going through a <br/>\ndivorce with the mother who is on drugs and homeless). The father <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work(I was told that his parents pay for the house) and <br/>\nappears to just hang out on the computer and play games. He seems to <br/>\nme like he has some mental issues (difficulties). I talked to his <br/>\nsister one day (who lives across the street from him) because Jio had <br/>\nrun down there and was playing inside there house (which is not what <br/>\nJio said he was going to do). She told me that I didn&#39;t want my son <br/>\nin his house...that it was dirty and that DYFS was over there once a <br/>\nweek. She said he had some mental slowness of some sort, but that he <br/>\nwould never hurt Jio or anything like that. He has said things like <br/>\nhe&#39;s looking for a girlfriend/friends...which I told him I was not <br/>\nsingle. Though he sister commented something like he already thinks <br/>\nI&#39;m his girlfriend. I guess becuase when I see him and his daughter <br/>\nI&#39;ll wave..or say Hi. The guy makes me uneasy, though he may just be <br/>\na nice guy thats slow. I have an autistic son so I&#39;m sensitive to <br/>\npeople with mental issues and such. I&#39;ve tried to tell Jio I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant him in the house because we don&#39;t know him and sometimes people <br/>\ncan seem nice but do bad things to kids. I&#39;ve said he may be nice but <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure and I don&#39;t trust him. But Jio insists on running down <br/>\nthere and going in their house. I also feel bad to say something like <br/>\nI don&#39;t trust you to the father when yesterday he said I trust you to <br/>\nme. I&#39;ve told Jio to invite her to our house or he could play outside <br/>\nat thier house but that when she went inside he had to come home. <br/>\nHe&#39;s not very happy with this. And its getting colder and I know its <br/>\ngoing to be harder to play outside for long periods. What would you <br/>\ndo? Should I just trust him for short periods or insist that he <br/>\ncannot go into thier house.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachael~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7113,"nextTopicId":7003}}
