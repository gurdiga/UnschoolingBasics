It is wholly a place for those interested in <br/>\nexploring the meaning and practice of education with others.<br/>\n<br/>\n“[Quo Vadis is] an amazing opportunity to learn from others, open one&#39;s <br/>\nmind to alternative learning, and meet dynamic, compassionate, <br/>\nopen-minded, intelligent individuals who are working towards <br/>\naccomplishing their dreams and affecting positive change in the world,” <br/>\naccording to previous attendee Lily Oglesby.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew this year at Quo Vadis is the Young Adult Track, a weeklong program <br/>\ndesigned specifically to address the needs of self-educated people <br/>\ntransitioning from adolescence to adulthood.  The Young Adult Track is <br/>\ndesigned to inform, inspire, and empower participants to face the <br/>\nfuture with confidence. Participants benefit from the focused <br/>\nobjectives and purpose of the track while still having access to the <br/>\nworkshops and fascinating people who attend Quo Vadis.
