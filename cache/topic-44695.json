Sounds like a funny piece of advice on an unschooling list, doesn&#39;t it? But much as you might want to &quot;share the joy&quot; until you have a few years of experience and are feeling really &quot;solid&quot; as an unschooler, you&#39;ll likely find that talking about unschooling sets you up for conversations you&#39;d rather not have. There are a lot of negative stereotypes about unschooling, and just staring out isn&#39;t a good time to face those head on. A big part of unschooling involves setting kids up to succeed on their own terms - be sure to set Yourself up to succeed too ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nInitially, its better to say &quot;homeschooling&quot; and &quot;for now&quot; and &quot;we can always put him in school if this doesn&#39;t work&quot;. After all, all those things are true, even if not in the way other people will &quot;hear&quot; them. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] How can I find out what requirements Oregon has for unschooling?","postDate":"1282739345","msgId":44696,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrTCszZ0o9ZFZGSHFRNWI1a01wSjhVS3NrNXFKMlIwdWRrYj1ZeEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGk1MXNhbCthaHY4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk1MXNhbCthaHY4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44695,"nextInTopic":44697,"prevInTime":44695,"nextInTime":44697,"topicId":44695,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am not in OR (yet) but unschooling is legally the same as homeschooling.
