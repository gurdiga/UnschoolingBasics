Barbara Chase mentioned how saying &quot;yes&quot; to everything<br/>\nwithout any thought can be just as mindless as saying &quot;no&quot; without<br/>\nthought.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe entire point is that we act more MINDFULLY of our actions and<br/>\nchoices, including our interactions with our children. If we really<br/>\nthink about WHY we are answering a certain way, if we really examine<br/>\nthe motivations and such, I think we can find that place where the<br/>\nanswer is done with thoughtfulness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we say &quot;yes&quot; with no thought as to WHY we&#39;re saying it, or HOW to<br/>\nmeet the request, we may find ourselves at odds with our own world.<br/>\nThe point isn&#39;t to ignore our own needs, or ignore natural<br/>\nlimitations, but rather to get outside the box and be creative!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo many, many things that parents seem to automatically say &quot;no&quot; to<br/>\nare pretty easy to navigate with some brainstorming and flexibility.<br/>\nThat thought process of &quot;how can we make this work for everyone?&quot; is<br/>\nSUCH a healthy way to approach challenges rather than a kneejerk<br/>\nanswer. Considering all angles and everyone&#39;s needs allows for many<br/>\ndifferent solutions to surface and encourages children to contribute<br/>\nwithout feeling their desires are somehow &quot;wrong&quot; because an adult is<br/>\nputting a stop to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere ARE &quot;no&#39;s&quot; in life, but how do we approach them? With an open,<br/>\nflexible mind or with the idea that life sucks and we need to learn<br/>\nhow to deal with it? Too many of us were taught that attitude and<br/>\nunschooling gives us an opportunity to heal those attitudes.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":292920988,"authorName":"sherkinpirate","from":"&quot;sherkinpirate&quot; &lt;pirateking@...&gt;","profile":"sherkinpirate","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: kids need to hear NO from parents/cheap computers","postDate":"1168123016","msgId":20332,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVucDhhOCtra3I4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVucDZtNStob2IwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20327,"nextInTopic":20347,"prevInTime":20331,"nextInTime":20333,"topicId":20325,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
