One thing I did this morning in support of us is to unscubscribe from all those &#39;helpful&#39; newsletters and e-stuff like BabyZone, etc.  These are things I signed up for when I was pregnant because I thought everyone did and there would be good information there.  Yes, there is sometimes good information, but it mostly doesn&#39;t support what our family is all about.  I&#39;ve struggled for a long time with what I see most other parents doing being SO different than what feels right for me.  I say me right now because dh is coming along, but is still thinking quite traditionally and he still believes there is nothing wrong with public school (argh! :o)).  I remember hearing SO much about babies not being able to soothe themselves if I didn&#39;t let them cry it out, so I even bought into that wacked out thinking and tried that (for a very short time until my common sense and my intuition<br/>\n kicked in), and it&#39;s something I will always regret doing.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;d love to hear more from people whose co-parent isn&#39;t quite on the same page yet and what helped you be cohesive in unschooling.  I thought it would be a breeze because he&#39;s at work all day and we would unschool during school hours (how funny is that!), but I&#39;m quickly seeing it&#39;s so much more than that, and I really want to see the flow that is happening with the girls and I during the day continue seamlessly after dh gets home from work.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  As always, suggestions most welcome!!!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks for listening :o)<br/>\n  Jodi <br/>\n                         <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?
