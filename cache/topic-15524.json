I think it IS our role, as unschooling parents, to  <br/>\n&quot;ensure&quot; that our kids are living a lifestyle, with all that  <br/>\nencompasses, which provides them ample opportunities to expand their  <br/>\nhorizons in a zillion ways - including helping them make connections  <br/>\nto other things, from the things they are already into.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, but folks that are newer to unschooling, or just trying to get an<br/>\n&gt; understanding might be best to try and see those connections  <br/>\n&gt; themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And they need to understand that unschooling parents are really NOT  <br/>\nignoring their kids. When they see my kid playing videogames for 6  <br/>\nhours a day, they might think that I&#39;m &quot;doing nothing.&quot; Not true. I&#39;m  <br/>\ntalking to them about the game, being interested so that they feel  <br/>\nfree to talk to ME about it, I&#39;m keeping my eyes out for connections  <br/>\nthat might interest them - movies, other games, books about the  <br/>\ngames, new items, game-playing opportunities, etc. I spend seemingly  <br/>\nendless hours at the game store - I may not stay there with them for  <br/>\nall those hours (I go off and have a cup of coffee and read a book or  <br/>\nshop for myself) - but I spend SOME time there and I get to know the  <br/>\ngames and what they like about them and all that. AND - I support  <br/>\ntheir energy, their focus. When we happen to drive by a game store  <br/>\nand they want to go in, I don&#39;t groan - I say, &quot;Oh, cool. Yeah, let&#39;s  <br/>\ngo see what they&#39;ve got there.&quot; And, once inside, I might ask some  <br/>\nquestions - &quot;Oh, I haven&#39;t heard of that - what kind of game is  <br/>\nthat?&quot; &quot;Is that the type of game playing you&#39;re into right now?&quot; Or -  <br/>\nI have shy kids, so I&#39;ll be the one to initiate a conversation with  <br/>\nthe guys/girls working in the game store - to break the ice - and  <br/>\nthen my kids will have fun talking to them about how this game plays  <br/>\nand that game&#39;s weaknesses and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot of room for unschooling parents to support a child&#39;s  <br/>\ninterest in videogames - besides writing the checks &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I DO ensure my kids get all of that, but not for the sake of teaching<br/>\n&gt; them anything, but because we ALL share connections with each other<br/>\n&gt; all the time.

The professor makes it sound a little like parents ought to  <br/>\nforce something - videogame connection lessons &lt;G&gt; - having read  <br/>\nother stuff he&#39;s written, I don&#39;t think that is what he meant by  <br/>\n&quot;ensure.&quot; I think he means parents ought to support the interest and  <br/>\nhave conversations about it - not be telling the kid he&#39;s playing too  <br/>\nmuch and to go do something more valuable, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"gaming thoughts","postDate":"1152536555","msgId":15524,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU4dGo1Yit2dmU3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15535,"prevInTime":15523,"nextInTime":15525,"topicId":15524,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~Ensure?
