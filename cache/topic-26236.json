Do you EVER get to the point where you&#39;re NOT feeling this way?<br/>\nA1:  As they get older and need less<br/>\nA2:  It&#39;s normal to need some down-time.<br/>\nA3:  The desire is normal, and take the time where you can.  But &quot;there is<br/>\nnot adult time but family time.&quot;<br/>\nA4:  Sometimes.  It&#39;s several pieces of a puzzle.  Kids will get older.<br/>\nDon&#39;t wait until you&#39;re burned out before getting a break.  Change your<br/>\nperspective.<br/>\nA5:  Changing perspectives:  have a conversation with myself...stating how I<br/>\nwant to BE that day.<br/>\nA6:  Changing perspectives:  children are not &quot;demanding this or that...&quot;<br/>\nthey are expressing a need and you are looking for a way to meet that need.<br/>\nYou begin...listening to what your child is really saying rather than what<br/>\nis coming out of their mouth.&quot;<br/>\nA7:  Changing perspectives:  Tell self that in so many years, they will not<br/>\nwant my attention so much<br/>\nA8:  Changing perspectives:  Smell your kids&#39; heads.  Connect in a primal<br/>\nkind of way with our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ2. What do you do to take a break, if you do?<br/>\na. Carve out &quot;me&quot; time (NOTE: There are LOTS of examples of this, I just had<br/>\nto put them all in here.)<br/>\nb.  Get up early<br/>\nc.  Martial Arts classes<br/>\nd.  Computer games<br/>\ne.  non-child movies on weekends while spouse takes a shift<br/>\nf. Read a book<br/>\ng.  Read a book on the toilet<br/>\nh.  Do what I want in-between the 3 million things they want fro mme<br/>\ni.  Stay up later<br/>\nj.  If they agree, run to the story by myself<br/>\nk.  Get the kids all worn out so they&#39;ll fall asleep earlier<br/>\nl.  Exercise every day if you can...it doesn&#39;t have to be a life-changing<br/>\nregimen to be mood changing.  Maybe try some mood-altering substance like<br/>\nmagnesium or pasta or light therapy.<br/>\nm.  Take advantage of when they want to stay and grandma&#39;s<br/>\nn.  Take a break WITH them.  Declare tickle or chase time.  After so many<br/>\nminutes they will play alone to give you more time alone doing your thing.<br/>\nj.  Take long showers.<br/>\nk.  If I&#39;m cranky...go into a room alone for five minutes and calm myslef<br/>\nwith breathing or yoga and positive self-talk.<br/>\nl.  Bounce on the trampoline.<br/>\nm: Become aware of the stress build-up and take breaks early on so as not to<br/>\nexplode later.<br/>\nn: Play dates<br/>\no: Take advantage of times when kids amuse themselves<br/>\np: &quot;I need a rest right now.  If there&#39;s an emergency, come get me...&quot;<br/>\nq: Imagine there was a witness who held me in some regard (what to do when<br/>\nit&#39;s tough)<br/>\nr: Listen to music<br/>\ns: Put on a movie.<br/>\nt: You and spouse consciously try to take up the slack for the other when<br/>\nthey&#39;re feeling the stress.  &quot;It&#39;s a dance really!&quot;<br/>\nu: Alternate weekend activities with spouse to let the other one do stuff<br/>\n(usually un-fun stuff, but solo stuff nonetheless).<br/>\nv:  &quot;...I put out a message on our unschoolers group.  I asked whether there<br/>\nwas a young person who would like to be a mother&#39;s helper...&quot;<br/>\nw:  &quot;...if one of us gets stressed out, we get time to be on our own.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nQ3: Am I just making a mountain out of a molehill?<br/>\nA1: No.<br/>\nA2: Yes- No- Maybe-.  If they died tomorrow you&#39;d regret the many times you<br/>\ntook a break from them.  They are small, and they WANT to be around you.<br/>\nA3: Maybe.  Depends on who you are.  But if you don&#39;t do some self-checking,<br/>\nyou could be headed for a big crisis.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Comments:<br/>\n1.

That&#39;s fine most of the time but it can often feel <br/>\nlike I have more than one child at a time. I actually have two, but they <br/>\nwere really spread out, so it is like I have two only children if that <br/>\nmakes sense. My husband has two from a previous marriage, but they were <br/>\n13 and 11 when my daughter and I came into the relationship when she was <br/>\n2 years. Then when my son was born (the only child between my husband <br/>\nand myself) my daughter was 12 and his kids were full grown with their <br/>\nown families. Now my son is 11 (nearly 12) and my daughter is full <br/>\ngrown, though still living with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaleb has always been incredibly emotional as he has early onset bipolar <br/>\ndisorder. However I am also bipolar, my husband has problems with <br/>\ndepression, and my daughter is also bipolar so the emotions in this <br/>\nhouse can run pretty high at times. Sometimes in order to keep the <br/>\nsanity, one of us needs a time out. My husband and I have a running <br/>\nagreement that if one of us gets stressed out, we get time to be on our <br/>\nown. I have to have that time as it can be highly unhealthy if I don&#39;t. <br/>\nBeing an artist, I will basically go into my studio and turn on the <br/>\nmusic and take time for myself for an hour or several and just create, <br/>\nuntil I feel like I can be with Caleb again and be a loving, caring <br/>\nadult. During that time, my husband takes over, and keeps him occupied. <br/>\nCaleb doesn&#39;t feel this is me being neglectful of him, because he gets <br/>\nalone time with Dad at that point, I get some sanity time, and the same <br/>\ngoes for my husband if he needs time out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to do this more often years ago, but now that Caleb is older, he <br/>\nis spending more time doing his own thing. He goes to visit his friends <br/>\nin he neighborhood, is outside playing, or has other friends over that <br/>\nkeeps him occupied. It does get MUCH easier as they get older. I <br/>\nactually feel a bit left out now that he doesn&#39;t need me as much <br/>\nanymore, but I know that this is just a part of growing up. Once we <br/>\nstart unschooling we will have plenty of together time once again, <br/>\nbecause there won&#39;t be time at school and time with friends, it will be <br/>\ntime with me and time with friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be a good time to sit down with your wife, and offer time out <br/>\nfor her and ask for a bit of time out for yourself when you need it as <br/>\nwell. These can be made special times for the kids as well.  I know that <br/>\n  you may want more time alone together with your wife, but these short <br/>\ntime outs with everyone&#39;s blessing can be a lifesaver as well. If there <br/>\nis something special that your kids love to do, make that the special <br/>\ntime to spend with Dad while mom takes a break, or vice-versa. Then the <br/>\nkids might look forward to those times just as much as each of you do!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be as simple as being able to go to the store alone, or to go for <br/>\na walk for a while to regroup, or go into another room and read, do <br/>\nexercises, or whatever floats your boat. They have been a mental and <br/>\nemotional lifesaver for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; This is a cross-post, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;ll be many duplicates.

Here goes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was reading online recently about a woman who &quot;needed a break&quot; from her<br/>\n&gt; kids.  Most responses to her post were shock, surprise, and in general not<br/>\n&gt; really understanding why someone would NOT want to be with their kids.<br/>\n&gt; There were a  couple of &quot;sure, I hear you.&quot;  And there were other issues<br/>\n&gt; involved that I don&#39;t want to touch on here.  But I fully get this.  This is<br/>\n&gt; an issue for me.  My kids DO wear me out, physically, emotionally, and<br/>\n&gt; mentally.  And I&#39;m the one who goes to work during the week.  DW feels the<br/>\n&gt; same way, only more so sometimes.  Most of the time things are fine.  But<br/>\n&gt; sometimes we get really stressed, and when it happens to both of us at the<br/>\n&gt; same time, then life is not good.

The biggest thing that<br/>\nhas helped is during those times when we are both spent each of us<br/>\nconsciously tries to take up the slack of the other... if he is<br/>\ngetting frustrated I try to have more patience if I am blowing my top<br/>\nhe tries to step in and take the weight off.   It&#39;s a dance really!  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer your other questions.... I have four kids ages 17, 14, 12<br/>\nand 6.... as the kids get older and are able to step in and help with<br/>\nthe younger kids I have felt less overwhelmed.    Your kids are little<br/>\nand believe me it&#39;s lasts for such a short time so don&#39;t wish them<br/>\nbig!    It does get easier when you change your thinking gradually...<br/>\ndemands become needs (mindset starting off is that your child is<br/>\ndemanding this or that...eventually you see they are expressing a need<br/>\nand you are looking for a way to meet that need)  you begin to spend<br/>\nmore time listening to what your child is really saying rather than<br/>\nwhat is coming out of their mouth (there are many ways of speaking,<br/>\nwatch your child&#39;s eyes and body language is the ice cream really what<br/>\nthe issue is or are they asking for YOU and YOUR attention?<br/>\n--hypothetical ice cream my example!)    You also begin to understand<br/>\nhow to be more honest with your children... I do tell my children that<br/>\nI need a break, I do tell them no (not knee jerk no but when<br/>\ncircumstances just won&#39;t allow something...no money, no time other<br/>\npeople&#39;s rules etc)  but I try to help them to do or get the things<br/>\nthey want.   I think it would be a disservice to never let your child<br/>\nknow you are sad, tired, or whatever... don&#39;t use your feelings as a<br/>\nclub but being open and honest.... saying &quot;you know I really would<br/>\nlove to play legos with you but for 10 minutes Daddy really needs to<br/>\nsit quietly and recharge&quot;   that&#39;s being honest and communicating your<br/>\nneeds as well.... it&#39;s much better than playing legos and resenting it<br/>\nor being half hearted about it (no one likes a half hearted lego<br/>\nDaddy!)   I do have days when I am exhausted and my 6 yr old demands<br/>\nmore than I feel up to doing ...there are days when I handle it well<br/>\nand others when I have to negotiate alot to meet his needs and my own.<br/>\n  It really comes down to changing your thinking about what your child<br/>\nis asking for.    Consensual living is not just about kids getting all<br/>\nof their needs met... it&#39;s about everyone in the family having their<br/>\nneeds met.    I heard a speaker at a conference once speak about this<br/>\ntype of thing (not an unschooling conference so it was from a<br/>\ndifferent &quot;place&quot; than most of us are but relevant all the same!) <br/>\nAnyway the title of her workshop was something along the lines of<br/>\n&quot;Putting on your own Oxygen mask first!&quot;    While I don&#39;t put my needs<br/>\nahead of my children&#39;s needs I do consider them in the scheme of my<br/>\nlife..... I am no good if I just do and do and do for everyone else<br/>\nand never take care of me.   I read before bed.... sometimes that is<br/>\nat a decent hour but some nights it&#39;s not because everyone was up<br/>\nreally late but I still do it because it feeds my need to relax and<br/>\nrecharge.   My husband is a napper... he works weird hours so he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get enough sleep most of the time because he wants to spend<br/>\ntime with the family (he works from 3 am until around noon so instead<br/>\nof going to bed early he hangs out with us until 10or 11pm)  A lot of<br/>\nafternoons he comes in and really needs a nap... so he will make a<br/>\ndeal with the kids if they want him to do something ...he gets his nap<br/>\nand at a certain time they can wake him up to do what they wanted to<br/>\ndo.   They are good about respecting his need for rest because they<br/>\nknow he will play when he is rested.   There are times when our 6 yr<br/>\nold really doesn&#39;t want to wait so they make a deal that he will play<br/>\nfor a while and then take a nap.   Anyway because he is honest with<br/>\nthem about this need they don&#39;t bother him while he is napping.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a process... all of it... some days I think I am highly evolved<br/>\nand then some days I hear myself snapping at some child to be quiet<br/>\nbecause I am tired or overwhelmed and not handling it well.   I feel<br/>\nlike an idiot on those days but almost always I realize I am ignoring<br/>\nMY needs too much.  If I take a break and get some quiet I am always<br/>\nmuch better!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the fact that you are being honest about having baggage (you<br/>\ncan&#39;t change something you don&#39;t acknowledge!)  and honest about<br/>\nhaving days when you feel overdone is a great step to examining what<br/>\nyou can change to make everything happier for everyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt does get easier as the kids get older and learn that their needs<br/>\nwill be met and get a little less intense about their needs (some kids<br/>\nnever lose this intensity so just know you might have one or even two<br/>\nof those so you will have to figure out what will work for your family<br/>\nif that is the case!) <br/>\n<br/>\nTake care!<br/>\nLisa Blocker<br/>\n<br/>\n  My kids DO wear me out, physically, emotionally, and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; mentally.

They are, by nature, much much needier<br/>\nthan older children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you have two close in age, with different enough needs, yet<br/>\nsimilar enough level of needs, that it is even harder.  It isn&#39;t a<br/>\nmountain out of a molehill -- but it is a common concern.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only have one child, now 15 3/4, so I didn&#39;t have it as intense as<br/>\nyou, but yes, there were times when I just needed down time.  Heck,<br/>\nonce, when he and I went to visit my folks w/out dh, about 20 minutes<br/>\nafter we were home again, dh said, &quot;I need a break from listening so<br/>\nmuch!&quot;  (Our ds was a real talker!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThings that helped me maintain some more sanity (though there are some<br/>\nwho would claim I have never had that!) were: play dates (I got some<br/>\nadult-talk time while the kids played, and there were other adults to<br/>\nhelp if intervention was needed), taking turns watching kids (play<br/>\ndates w/out parent there, basically -- though I didn&#39;t do that often,<br/>\nand only with those I really trusted), occasionally grandparents (they<br/>\nlived far, though, so that was rare).  Take advantage of times when<br/>\nthe kids are amusing themselves helps, too.   And feel free to tell<br/>\nyour kids, &quot;I need a rest right now.  If there is an emergency, come<br/>\nget me, but I&#39;m going to...&quot; (fill in the rest of that sentence as<br/>\nappropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd take heart - the older they get, the more independent they get! <br/>\nThen you get to the point where you feel sad at the thought of them<br/>\nmoving on....  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, some of the conversations you have with your kids over the years<br/>\ncan be really thought-provoking and interesting.  I used to (jokingly)<br/>\nthreaten to hold my ds back a year, so I had an extra year before he<br/>\nwent to college.  But as it turns out, he had other ideas, and we are<br/>\nmaking this our last year, and he starts college (locally) full-time<br/>\nnext year.  He told me, after I joked about holding him back, &quot;Much as<br/>\nI love you guys, and love living with you, I want to get on with my<br/>\nlife.&quot;  Sigh, I know, dear, and that&#39;s as it should be.
