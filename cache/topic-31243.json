I have a 4yo and a 9 month old. I bought a <br/>\nhouse and moved the family when my bab was only 2 weeks old and <br/>\nwhile my dh was deployed. He was gone from January 2007 to January <br/>\n2008. I had the baby in June 2007. At the time that I had the baby <br/>\nand moved I also had my teenager with me. It is now almost 10 months <br/>\nlater and the garage is still a mess and there are boxes around the <br/>\nhouse and nothing is quite put together. I can&#39;t do much with the <br/>\nbaby in a sling, either, and I&#39;ve tried a ring sling, a mei tai and <br/>\na wrap. My back hurts too much. I love my slings and use them all <br/>\nthe time, just not for housework or unpacking. My dh is home and <br/>\nworking on things but it&#39;s still very slow going. He goes to work <br/>\nduring the day and still has to leave for a few weeks here and <br/>\nthere. When he is home we&#39;d much rather do things together and with <br/>\nthe kids than one of spending all our time cleaning or unpacking or <br/>\norganizing. So, it&#39;s just going very slowly. Most days I wonder if <br/>\nit will be done before we have to move again. It causes me a lot of <br/>\nstress if I let it. I try to just understand things will be slow <br/>\ngoing and then let it all go. That may be all anyone can do in such <br/>\na situation.

I feel like you were talking about ME!  I was a<br/>\nvery active AP when my son was first born.  I had never really heard about<br/>\nit before I was a mom.  But when my son was about 3 or 4 months old, I<br/>\nstumbled across Dr. Sear&#39;s Baby Book, and everything just made sense to me.<br/>\nI had bought a crib before DS was born, but he only slept in it a handful of<br/>\ntimes, because it just didn&#39;t feel right.  After reading the Baby Book, I<br/>\nfelt confident to trust my instinct, read my baby&#39;s cues and officially<br/>\ndeclared myself an AP parent.<br/>\n<br/>\n6 years, and 2 more children later, I stumbled across unschooling in a<br/>\nsimilar way.  A friend let me borrow The Unschooling Handbook.  It hit me<br/>\nthe same way that AP did.  It all just seemed to make sense to me.  I was<br/>\nlike, &quot;Yes!  THIS is the way I want to raise my children!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also felt a little removed from it. As I read, I started feeling more<br/>\nand more like this was the kind of parent I USED to be.  Somehow I had<br/>\nveered away from AP ideals a bit.  I wondered at what point did I stop<br/>\nlistening to and trusting my children?  Why did I ignore them sometimes on<br/>\nthe playground just so I could have an adult conversation?  When did<br/>\nhousework become more important than playtime?  When was the last time I<br/>\njust sat down and hung out with my kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs soon as I read &quot;Parenting a Free Child,&quot; I wanted to go back to how<br/>\nthings were before.  And I am now working towards that.  We&#39;ve only been<br/>\nunschooling for about a month or so, and already I can see a change in the<br/>\nway my kids respond to me!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why some AP parents throw everything away as babies grow up.<br/>\nMaybe we feel social pressure to &quot;get them ready for school.&quot;  Maybe we feel<br/>\nlike we need to have &quot;perfect&quot; little children so others will think we are<br/>\n&quot;good&quot; parents.   I&#39;m not sure.  I just know that I&#39;m so glad that I&#39;ve had<br/>\nthe chance to be redirected back to a parenting style that I truly feel is<br/>\nright.

Like I said we<br/>\njust had a baby 6 months ago and then (what was I thinking) we bought<br/>\na house a couple months ago. So I have been overwhelmed with all that<br/>\n*needs* to happen. I am still not unpacked and moved in. Plus, my dh<br/>\nhas been working 15-16 hour days 7 days a week on a project, that will<br/>\nhopefully be done soon. And he is going to be away for 2 weeks<br/>\nstarting this friday (arg) and those things have been adding pressure.<br/>\nI don&#39;t really have any support system.<br/>\nI try to spend as much time with the kids as possible. The break downs<br/>\nusually occur at the end of the day when everyone is tired (of course)<br/>\nBUT I did realize that I have been viewing my son as the &quot;problem&quot;<br/>\ninstead of being a partner in figuring things out with him. I have<br/>\nbeen observing much in the last few days and can feel this awakening<br/>\nto a new perspective. He one big blow up the other day, I remained<br/>\nclam and focused on him. Since then he has been feeling better.<br/>\nSeeking me out instead of butting heads.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  When you&#39;re out with other kids - the temptation is to sit with the<br/>\n&gt;  moms and gab, but you need to be nearby your son to be able to help<br/>\n&gt;  him. He doesn&#39;t have the impulse control, yet, to stop his anger long<br/>\n&gt;  enough to go get an adult to help him. So be RIGHT there ready to<br/>\n&gt;  help. He won&#39;t need you to do that forever, just for this<br/>\n&gt;  developmental stage.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe this should be another thread but I HATE talking to other<br/>\nmothers. Not all of them but most. I loathe co-op days. I only go<br/>\nbecause my 11dd NEEDS it. She is very social and has always craved<br/>\npeople. We have been going since we moved here about 2 years ago. They<br/>\nare her friends and as I don&#39;t want to talk to their mothers much we<br/>\ndon&#39;t do too many playdates. I am wondering how everyone one here<br/>\nfound other unschoolers? Their is a PA unschoolers yahoo group I<br/>\nbelong to but no one lives down here. And most aren&#39;t radical. I have<br/>\nthought to start my own group but I am not sure how. What are the<br/>\nlogistics of a group.

I am part of a large AP group in my city, and lots of the kids are getting older.  The talk now centers on finding the perfect preschool and finding the perfect discipline method to have perfect little compliant kids.  I find I am just sort of naturally moving away from that group and more towards my local unschooling crowd.  With the unschooling families my girls and I get to hang out with parents who trust and respect their kids so much, and it&#39;s beautiful to see how settled and happy the kids are.  We&#39;ve had many many playtimes where there hasn&#39;t been a single conflict between any of the kids - they just seem more relaxed about life in general.  It&#39;s so challenging for us to be around other families that aren&#39;t living consensually that we just don&#39;t choose to do it very<br/>\n often anymore.  When I speak up about what we&#39;re doing I get looks like I&#39;ve just landed from another planet.

I make sure that they are safe and that they aren&#39;t harrassed by each other. I step in when I feel that I need to, but I can&#39;t make them like each other.

I do believe that she hits and destroys things for a<br/>\nreason.  She feels hurt, ignored, curious (she just LOVES the scissors --<br/>\nand has to try it out on EVERYthing), etc.  I know that this is how she<br/>\nhandles the hurt that&#39;s inside her, and how she sometimes handles her<br/>\nexploration.<br/>\n===================<br/>\nRedirection is a good tool to have if someone is exploring in a dangerous way, or even a way that can add stress. I wrote about Linnaea and her friend playing with flour the other day at the bottom of the stairs. David (dh) got upset. The floor there is parquet, so lots of little bits of wood with lots of little crevices. Instead of telling them to stop or him to mellow out, I moved the play to a better room and made sure that I was the one to clean it up when they were done. If I&#39;d let it unfold the way it was beginning, with tension and resentment building, it could have blown up into an aggressive encounter.  By moving between the two parties and coming up with something that allowed both goals to be met, flour not on parquet floor and flour play period, it didn&#39;t get to bad feelings. <br/>\n<br/>\nLinnaea tends to feel jealous over things. Last night she felt jealous that Simon was going to sleep with me (David had chosen to sleep in another room as he had to work this morning and we were up late watching My Name is Earl so there was a spare space in the parental bed). She felt bad about feeling jealous. Like it meant she wasn&#39;t a good person or that it wasn&#39;t fair to Simon that she felt so jealous. I said that I love that she wants to be with me so much that she wants all of my time. And it is true, it is a compliment to me how much she wants my attention. I said I wish her desire to be with me didn&#39;t leave her feeling bad. And she snuggled deeper into me and I read to her. I don&#39;t know if it helped, but it made me feel better. It helped me to have a less angry stance on her jealousy, her competition with her brother. I know that when I look at the direct time I spend with Linnaea and the direct time I spend with Simon, I spend far more with<br/>\n Linnaea. Sometimes it is easy for me to feel angry or bitter or resentful that she is saying that she doesn&#39;t want Simon to get my attention. It helped last night to look at it from a different perspective. <br/>\n<br/>\n====================<br/>\n<br/>\nConcerning how she handles her hurt feelings, we&#39;ve been trying to work with<br/>\nher for a couple of years now.  And I feel almost completely out of patience<br/>\n(some days I have less than zero patience).  We&#39;re so utterly frustrated<br/>\nwith this, we&#39;re reacting more to her instead of responding mindfully (NOT<br/>\ngood).  Hitting, spitting, throwing things at the object of her anger is her<br/>\nfirst response.  Her second is to let it sit, and hours later systematically<br/>\nshred a picture dd1 had made.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====================<br/>\nWhat is she like when she isn&#39;t hurt or angry? Can you think about her in that light more frequently? I went through a period of walking on eggshells around Linnaea of defining her more by her angry and reactive moments than by her joyful and laughing ones. It helps me to be kind to her when I can think of her as funny and engaging and joyful and sparky and interesting and chatty and filled with motion and light. It doesn&#39;t change her, I can&#39;t do that. I can&#39;t make her not jealous or not angry or not reactive. But I can be kind to her when she needs me to be kind. I can be filled with patience and energy and generousity. It helps me to be the parent that I want to be.<br/>\n====================<br/>\nNo, we have not read Siblings Without Rivalry, but it sounds like we need<br/>\nto.  dd1 does not like to be around her sister.  I&#39;m afraid this is really<br/>\nhurting their relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nHovering may be good for us until she learns to pause before mixing it up.<br/>\nLeaving the park immediately would be good except that it seems unfair to<br/>\ndd1 who&#39;s been doing just fine.  No-win, but leaving early is probably the<br/>\nbetter choice.<br/>\n===================<br/>\nIf you left early to dd1&#39;s dismay, could you go do something else that they would both enjoy? Something like go and get ice cream or go to a video store and pick out a DVD to watch when you get home or something instead that makes it feel not like punishment but like what it is, avoiding an unpleasant encounter. In my experience, hovering tends to help eliminate a lot of the need to bail on an activity. If you come to the park with lots of cool things to play with and are totally prepared to play Billy Goats Gruff over and over again, there isn&#39;t a lot of need or stress about being at the park. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":215778715,"authorName":"Jodi Bezzola","from":"Jodi Bezzola &lt;jodibezzola@...&gt;","profile":"jodibezzola","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: aggression","postDate":"1206674326","msgId":31348,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMxMTAyMC42MjQ1LnFtQHdlYjU0MTA0Lm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZzaGs5aytqcDE1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31346,"nextInTopic":31350,"prevInTime":31347,"nextInTime":31349,"topicId":31243,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~I also did a lot of coaching them to ask for a turn, and to wait until the first one is finished.

And I feel almost completely out of patience<br/>\n(some days I have less than zero patience).  We&#39;re so utterly frustrated<br/>\nwith this, we&#39;re reacting more to her instead of responding mindfully (NOT<br/>\ngood).  Hitting, spitting, throwing things at the object of her anger is her<br/>\nfirst response.  Her second is to let it sit, and hours later systematically<br/>\nshred a picture dd1 had made.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, we have not read Siblings Without Rivalry, but it sounds like we need<br/>\nto.  dd1 does not like to be around her sister.

Which portions<br/>\ncould have been resolved without me, because I only seem to have<br/>\nserved as a stopgap measure?

In the first one he and another boy<br/>\nwere hitting each other. After talking about i found out that the<br/>\nother boy had jumped on his friends crackers after they had asked him<br/>\nto watch out. So easy pushed him off the crackers then the other kid<br/>\nhit him...etc<br/>\nthe second situation was another little guy kept poking Easy, he asked<br/>\nhim to stop several times. Easy walked away, kid followed him still<br/>\npoking him and laughing. At this point I got up from nursing. Before I<br/>\ngot over there Easy had smacked his hand away. I asked Easy to keep<br/>\nhis hands to his self and placed my body between him and the other<br/>\nkid. I ask the kid to stop poking. He wouldn&#39;t. His mother said that<br/>\nhe was &quot;just playing&quot;. I tryed to talk with the boys but the mom keep<br/>\ninterjecting and being quite negating. I dropped it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last incident was today, a little girl kept pushing Easy but I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know. he appearently got fed up and pushed her back. We talked<br/>\na little but the girls mom said shes been doing that and not to worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other parents do time outs and take away privileges. I don&#39;t know<br/>\nif leaving the playgroup would be warranted in these situations. They<br/>\nweren&#39;t OK for him to hit but they weren&#39;t unprovoked either. I feel<br/>\nlike I talked about it with him. Do you think I should have left? I am<br/>\nhaving a hard time with drawing lines ( I was parented with ever<br/>\nchanging boundaries and have a hard time making good boundary<br/>\ndiscions) Where exactly should I draw the line? If he hits at all or<br/>\nif he hits first or what?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaygrooup use to mostly be kids from 8-14 with Easy and two other<br/>\nkids being the little sibs (they are all the same age), recently we<br/>\nhad a large influx of people and there are now like 15 kids between<br/>\n4-7. So there are more social interaction issues coming up, not just<br/>\nwith mine. But i don&#39;t smack my kid or give him a time out. So should<br/>\nI just give him a time out instead of take him home because thats what<br/>\neveryone else does?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Mar 24, 2008 at 8:37 PM, Pamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  On Mar 24, 2008, at 5:15 PM, Faith Void wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I think that I am<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; being respectful to all parties invovled but I get the feeling that<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; some people think I should do more, i.e. punish or time out or<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; something.

He will strike first, talk later. This is generally directed at his<br/>\nolder sister but sometimes towards me or his father. And recently<br/>\ntowards other children in our homeschool playgroup. What I do is<br/>\nusually ask him to stop. This is enough most of the time to get him to<br/>\nphysically stop and then we can talk. Other times, I physically step<br/>\nin an stop him, i.e. hold his arm so that he is physically unable to<br/>\nstrike the person. I talk to him directly about what is going on. I<br/>\nask him how he is feeling and ask/assess what his needs are/might be.<br/>\nIf I can I try to facilitate a discussion between the two children to<br/>\nwork out an agreement. This works pretty well/ But sometimes, I get<br/>\nthe feeling like this isn&#39;t enough for other parents. I always try to<br/>\nbe fair and diplomatic.  I allow both children to say their piece and<br/>\ncome to their own agreement. Occasionally I may offer a suggestion.<br/>\nBut don&#39;t require the kids to use my suggestion.

Is is<br/>\ndisrespectful to my son to physically remove him if he refuses to<br/>\ncontrol himself? Like when he is hitting his sister and won&#39;t stop. He<br/>\nwill occasionally say &quot;blah, blah, blah.&quot; when he doesn&#39;t want to hear<br/>\nwhat we have to say, including &quot;stop hitting&quot;. I feel like I try to<br/>\nreason with him until he becomes unreasonable. I am just really unsure<br/>\nhow to be respectful.

I have always tried to listen to my<br/>\nkids and let them be my guide but eventually received so many<br/>\nconflicting ideas (some helpful some less than) that I sometimes still<br/>\nfeel confused. I want to be respectful and loving to me kids AND I<br/>\nwant them to feel respected and loved. I am not sure that is always<br/>\ncoming acrossed. I know in part the aggression is coming from the<br/>\nbirth of his little sister and his feelings of confusion of being<br/>\ndisplaced. And in part from having lead poisoning as a small child. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to stop his aggression in total, I just need to be<br/>\nrespectful and to help him feel good about himself. He generally feels<br/>\nawful after an uncontrollable aggressive outburst. He is generally a<br/>\nsweet and empathetic child,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have internet access again and would be grateful to anyone who can<br/>\nhelp me sort this out.
