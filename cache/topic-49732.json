It&#39;s not a terribly realistic expectation on his part. Little kids are rarely amenable to that much scheduling - regardless of whether or not you&#39;re unschooling - unless you&#39;re willing to be really cold-blooded about their feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids want something that isn&#39;t realistic, it can help to dig down under the surface of that desire and see if there are ways to meet parts of it or ways to meet underlying needs separately. The same principle applies just as well to adults - better, because adults can do something kids (especially younger kids) cannot which is delay gratification.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am honoring mine and my children&#39;s &#39;things that we like&#39; all day! <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Always instantly and perfectly without any compromises? You&#39;re a phenomenon! Do your kids ever want to grab things another has, knock over things another built, do the exact opposite of a sibling? How do you handle those situations? Apply the same principles to the problem of your husband wanting something which is unrealistic and incompatible with the needs and desires of other family members. Find gentle, compassionate ways for him to get what he wants, but realize it&#39;s not possible for him to always get what he wants exactly how and when he wants it. Look for ways to help him wait and meet the underlying needs when he can&#39;t have what he wants right now. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":506344661,"authorName":"fundayeveryday","from":"fundayeveryday &lt;kristenssrr@...&gt;","profile":"kristenssrr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"alone time with husband","postDate":"1363014646","msgId":49732,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNjMwMTQ2NDYuNjUxNi5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTI2MTAzLm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":""},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49733,"prevInTime":49731,"nextInTime":49733,"topicId":49732,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
