(insert all the what ifs here)<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t been able to sleep since (go figure) and have been looking up possible causes for sleep walking. Of all the possibilities, only abnormal sleep patterns and fatigue really fit him. He&#39;s been testing his personal limits by staying up late but he rarely compensates by sleeping in and is usually up before I am. He also has been choosing ot sleep downstairs where we can&#39;t hear him very well. I think his sleeping patterns coupled with a possible family history on his bio dads side and maybe even a 14 hour Pokemon cartoon marathon (no I&#39;m not exaggerating, 14 hours! LOL) may have put his body over the edge last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m obviously pretty worried and by his reaction to waking up at the neighbors front door, so is he. He was in such a daze that he thanked me over and over for coming to get him as if he thought I might not! Then he did nothing but hug me until he fell asleep. It obviously really frightened him. I plan to take some precautionary steps (alarms on doors, maybe a bell around his ankle LOL) but I also want to talk to him about it. However I don&#39;t want him to be fearful this will happen again but I&#39;d like him to connect the possibilities of why it happened. I obviously don&#39;t want to force him in bed by 8pm but I do want him to be knowledgable and aware, ya know?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would be the best way to discuss this? I thought about looking at all the websites I found with him, that way I&#39;m not putting my ideas into it and I&#39;m allowing him to decide what he thinks the cause might be. But I will admit I&#39;m a little worried as to what to do if he doesn&#39;t see the connection and continues with the same patterns that this may happen again. Although I plan to take precautions, it&#39;s still a very frightening thought of how he could hurt himself indoors as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?<br/>\n <br/>\nTara<br/>\nOur Unschooling Blog:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://heartschooling.blogspot.com\">http://heartschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>\nCheck these out:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ardenguy.com/index.htm\">http://www.ardenguy.com/index.htm</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://RonPaul2008.com\">http://RonPaul2008.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://RonPaulLibrary.com\">http://RonPaulLibrary.com</a> <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2PUZoukfA&eurl=\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2PUZoukfA&eurl=</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NVHSforRonPaul.blogspot.com\">http://www.NVHSforRonPaul.blogspot.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?  <br/>\nFind them fast with Yahoo!
