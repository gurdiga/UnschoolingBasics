I was lucky Courtney had a great pediatrician who suggested she was ready for solids past 6 months AND when she started grabbing them off my plate and who stated the average age to wean was 3 years. She finally got interested in solids at 18 months and ate maybe 3 jars of baby food in her life.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We moved and the ped I got stuck with for a while with my son actually told me the very same thing. I feel blessed that I had already been educated in this area :) <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNew Yahoo! Messenger with Voice.
