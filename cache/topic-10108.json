Just dabble with her ideas. I really found her chart of<br/>\nbasic shapes helpful. We posted that and my children can now look at<br/>\nthings and break them down into their basic shapes (angled line, curvy<br/>\nline etc..) so it doesn&#39;t seem as intimidating when they want to draw<br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\nArt isn&#39;t about drawing things realistically though, that&#39;s just one<br/>\ntool you might want to have. Art is expression! Maybe she&#39;s had some<br/>\nidea that art is supposed to look a certain way? Has there been stress<br/>\nsurrounding artistic adventures in the past? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf she has received input about the &quot;right&quot; way to do things, that<br/>\ncould be part of the problem. If she believes art is trying to<br/>\nrealistically execute things we see, that could be part of the<br/>\nproblem. If she&#39;s simply frustrated by her skill level not matching<br/>\nher vision, well, she&#39;s an artist!!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLet her know that for every work of art a person is happy with, they<br/>\nthrow away or are frustated by about 10 other works!  As you work with<br/>\nmaterials, it does get easier to manipulate them in ways that make you<br/>\nsatisfied. Part of being an artist, is being frustrated. That isn&#39;t<br/>\neasy for a young person to understand though.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to find activities that are more about the experience, not any<br/>\noutcome. Set up some materials where she doesn&#39;t have to see you make<br/>\nanything.  Time creating together can be balanced with time spent<br/>\ncreating on your own. You can be present nearby, but not actively<br/>\ncreating with her and that might help...(or not).<br/>\n<br/>\nArt at a young age should really be about exploration. You might have<br/>\na bit of a perfectionist on your hands, in that case, accepting her<br/>\nfrustration and letting her own the process is about all you can do<br/>\naside from setting up materials that invite open ended creation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a book I&#39;ve been meaning to buy.
