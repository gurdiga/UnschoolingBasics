Then the machine beeps to tell you to come finish the<br/>\nbread.  I let it mix, knead and rise and then I take it out and knead by<br/>\nhand and let it rise again.  It takes about an hour to do all that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest complaint that I hear about bread is that it is too heavy or too<br/>\ndry.  that comes from measuring flour incorrectly. We are sold &quot;pre-sifted<br/>\nflour&quot; and so most people don&#39;t sift their flour before they measure it.  I<br/>\nkeep a small whisk in my flour container that I use to &quot;fluff&quot; the flour<br/>\nbefore I measure it.  Then I spoon it into a dry measure cup making sure not<br/>\nto compact it.  A dry measure cup measures differently than a liquid measure<br/>\ncup.  A dry measure cup is usually sold in a set of nesting cups.  I have a<br/>\nhalf cup measure that I just keep in my flour (I also have a quarter cup<br/>\nthat I keep in my sugars).  Liquid measure cups are the ones that have a<br/>\npourable spout.  Also a better way to measure wheat flour when you are<br/>\ncombining it with white (like for a recipe that calls for 2 cups whole wheat<br/>\nand 1 cup all purpose or bread flour) is to measure it once into a bowl with<br/>\nthe white flour and then mix it well together with a whisk and then<br/>\nremeasure it again (so in my example you would then measure out 3 cups of<br/>\nmixed flour).  You will have some left over, not a lot - less than 1/4 cup)<br/>\nbut it will make a huge difference in how your bread turns out.  If you use<br/>\n100% whole wheat, sift it then measure it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12170,"nextTopicId":12265}}
