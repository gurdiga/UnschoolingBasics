I asked why, and she said so that he&#39;d learn to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry. That made NO sense to me! Throughout my life, all my &quot;only&quot; <br/>\nchildren freinds were the *best* friends. They weren&#39;t selfish or <br/>\nhoarders but generous and giving. I&#39;d noticed this all my life. I&#39;d <br/>\nfound that my friends who had siblings very close in age were generally <br/>\nthe most stingy.<br/>\n<br/>\n*My* conclusion was that that was due to having to give up all you <br/>\nowned to someone else---being *forced* to share before you&#39;re ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was not going to have another child anyway (Dunc&#39;s another story! <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;), but I figured I could keep Cam out of those sharing situations as <br/>\nlong as I could.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe shared with him. We were as generous as we could be. I figured he&#39;d <br/>\nlearn about sharing from *our* modelling. NOT from being forced to <br/>\nshare what *he* had, but by being shared WITH. We thanked him when he <br/>\n*did* share.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems to have worked.

Emily was &quot;worse&quot; about<br/>\nthis than Mary  Elayne, but I think it was because Emily was the first and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have that &quot;built in playmate&quot; by being the second.  There was no one<br/>\nelse to give her attention than Mommy.  So Emily did everything with me.  We<br/>\ncooked together, slept together, played together, did laundry together, went<br/>\nto the bathroom together even!  I would get physically tired and fortunately<br/>\nmy co-parent recognized this and would give me a break on the weekends to go<br/>\ndo something by myself.  Usually I would just go and walk a labyrinth<br/>\nsomewhere or go hiking in the woods - just something where there were no<br/>\npeople or I might go take in a movie at the dollar theater.  Once I even<br/>\ntook a weekly class in cake decorating.  Find something to do and put it<br/>\ndown.  Mom&#39;s mental health is just as important as your child&#39;s.  Your child<br/>\nNEEDS you NOW but you also need to take care of YOU so that you will WANT to<br/>\nbe with your child instead of feeling like your child is a burden instead of<br/>\na delight!<br/>\n<br/>\n One of the girls had a younger sister, maybe 5 that wanted Rachel&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; shovel.  The girl kept asking and even trying to take it from dd.  I asked<br/>\n&gt; her if she&#39;d be willing to share her shovel with the girl, but clearly she<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t.  She eventually started offering the shovel to other girls there,<br/>\n&gt; but not the one girl.  (This is one of those things that screams<br/>\n&gt; vindictive<br/>\n&gt; in my mind, that I&#39;m trying to shed.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She saw this girl as wanting to take her shovel.
