I don&#39;t feel limited in any way because<br/>\nI choose not to watch certain shows or movies. Nobody is telling me<br/>\nwhat I should or shouldn&#39;t watch. Nobody is judging me for my choices.<br/>\nI DO have unlimited access yet I choose very carefully what I watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids will do the same, in a home filled with trust and respect. They<br/>\ndon&#39;t WANT to watch anything and everything out there. They will each<br/>\nchoose exactly what is nourishing for them personally, given the<br/>\nchance. It will look very different from family to family and person<br/>\nto person. What bothers me makes others laugh.<br/>\nWhat enchants me, may bore others. <br/>\n<br/>\nAround here, I have a 17 y.o. that rarely ever watches tv even though<br/>\nhe has one in his room. I have a 13y.o. that watches certain shows<br/>\nreligiously every week, only his favorites and rarely anything else<br/>\nand he also has a tv in his room.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh and I only watch shows occasionally, I&#39;m more likely to watch what<br/>\nsomeone else already has on. Ciara and Jalen (10 and 6) love Cartoon<br/>\nNetwork and have several favorites there. They probably watch more<br/>\nthan anyone else in the house.  They are more excited by a trip to the<br/>\nFarmer&#39;s Market or a walk in the rain or picking blackberries than<br/>\nanything on tv usually! Oh, they have a tv in each of their rooms AND<br/>\nmy room which they have access to at all times (they sleep with us). <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a technology rich household really. We actually own every game<br/>\nsystem since n64 came out other than the new Wii and PS3. Even with<br/>\nall of that, they&#39;re more likely to play WoW than watch tv.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve learned from all the tv and video games just like everything<br/>\nelse in our lives. Having those doesn&#39;t negate all the other wonderful<br/>\nactivities we choose. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m off on a tangent again. Not even answering your post really,<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking more about the other post about power tools and tv!<br/>\nThat&#39;s what happens when I get writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is, all the information about tv makes it sound like one<br/>\nmust choose tv OR a rich active life. One can have both. We do. It&#39;s<br/>\nall part of unschooling. It&#39;s all part of learning and exploration.

I used the word &quot;family&quot; for a reason, because for us (and I hope  <br/>\nfor others) we really DO decide as equally as possible. My son wants me to help <br/>\n him - if a scary scene comes on, he jams, lol, he is too scared to turn off <br/>\nthe  TV (he&#39;s 4, almost 5), so by his own choosing, he doesn&#39;t have unlimited <br/>\naccess  - he knows the stations numbers he likes and he has pretty much free <br/>\naccess to  the TV. Well, I guess in a sense that IS unlimited, as he decides <br/>\nfor himself,  huh?)We get into issues when the XBox is desired, or a movie wants <br/>\nto be  watched, or some other sort of 2-3 different people wanting to watch <br/>\n2-3  different things. That often requires a bit of help in the negotiation, <br/>\nbut  generally, it&#39;s a fairly smooth issue. My desire to watch Weeds is no more  <br/>\nimportant than my 2 year old&#39;s desire to see Caillou &quot;Food-a-licious&quot; for the <br/>\n 16th time ;) So...we make the differences work as best we can...<br/>\n <br/>\nRen, you are REALLY helping me (and Joyce, and Meredith and many others!!!)  <br/>\ntoo think critically.

I really appreciate that. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy feeling is that your parents would probably have been distant with you  no <br/>\nmatter if it was pre-TV or not. The vehicle used for their  disengagement of <br/>\nyou was the TV - almost like with me, food and lack of eating  is a symptom of <br/>\nmy ED, it&#39;s not that food itself is the issue, but the vehicle  used. Does <br/>\nthat make any sense? <br/>\n <br/>\nI can imagine, the pain and the resentment and I can imagine too, removing  <br/>\nsomething that caused hurt and loneliness, and what came to be a mindlessness  <br/>\ntype of thing. I can see you also, clearly questioning the situation and <br/>\ntrying  to work out your personal stuff at the same time. What hard work that is, <br/>\nand  that&#39;s a great thing to have happen. Growth, always! <br/>\n <br/>\nI, as I said before, LOVE TV, lol. I try to use it thoughtfully, but I also  <br/>\ndo &quot;gel out&quot; at times :) I enjoy it. I enjoy the discussions it can bring, the <br/>\n topics and the things shown to me that help me question more and more - with <br/>\nthe  kids and w/o them. I like (to try) being mindful in all my endeavors and <br/>\nI like  how TV helps me use critical thinking. <br/>\n <br/>\nAgain, thanks for discussing that! <br/>\nKaren  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25120,"nextTopicId":25168}}
