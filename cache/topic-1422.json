One day at the community college, Jay climbed just a short<br/>\nway up one of the trees.  I was fine with it.  But an<br/>\nadministrator/teacher/something... came by and yelled at him to get<br/>\ndown.  I assumed it had something to do with liability?  You might<br/>\nknow, Pam.  What&#39;s up with that?  Now I&#39;m never sure when we&#39;re out<br/>\nif a wall or tree is &quot;ok&quot; or if someone is going to come by and<br/>\nholler at us.  Amazing how a single incident will make you<br/>\nparanoid.  I will need to make sure I&#39;m very conscious about these<br/>\nthings... and not succumb to my knee jerk &quot;someone is going to yell<br/>\nat us&quot; reaction.  See now I&#39;m feeling a mite crappy because I know<br/>\nthat since then there have been several instances where I&#39;ve<br/>\ndisallowed his climbing in a public place due to fear of getting in<br/>\ntrouble.  I just hate when strangers take it upon themselves to<br/>\nfuss.  And they do.<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nThis reminded me of a situation that happened to me in my early twenties.<br/>\nMy mom and I were traveling on tour in Morocco.  We had left the pre-dinner<br/>\ncocktail party<br/>\nearly to go for a walk  We saw two beautiful lion statues and thought it<br/>\nwould make a nice<br/>\npicture.  I climbed up some steps and wrapped one arm around the lion for a<br/>\ncandid pose and suddenly<br/>\nheard yelling and froze.  There were two military men with machine guns<br/>\npointed directly at me.  They<br/>\nwere yelling in a foreign language and my mom was quite freaked out as well.<br/>\nIt was the first time<br/>\nI had ever had a gun of any kind drawn on me.  Apparantly it was a<br/>\ngovernment building and they<br/>\nwere very upset.  We took no more pictures but at least we have that one for<br/>\nposterity.  I still<br/>\nhave that little bit of trauma imprint in my psyche and am cautious at any<br/>\npublic building now.<br/>\nKay</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1403,"nextTopicId":1410}}
