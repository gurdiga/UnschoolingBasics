Tell us your &quot;best-ofs&quot;: Favourite games, fun  <br/>\noutings, interesting interests of your children that you think you  <br/>\nonly found out about because you value unschooling principles and  <br/>\ntheir interests (like a child interested in spiders and bugs,  <br/>\n&quot;traditionally parenting&quot; parents would maybe have said, that&#39;s  <br/>\n&quot;yuck!&quot;, but an unschooling parent helped their preschooler and now  <br/>\nthey have a terrarium or something like that - just to give you an  <br/>\nidea what we&#39;re looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not necessary, but you may also draw the line to how this or that  <br/>\nactivity is &quot;educational&quot; from a schoolish point of view. But we don&#39;t  <br/>\nput too much focus on that, so just if it fits. It shouldn&#39;t sound  <br/>\nlike unschooling parents take care that their children &quot;learn&quot; typical  <br/>\neducational subjects that are taught in school, just by playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt shouldn&#39;t be too lon, 100-400 words is enough!
