His self confidence seems to have taken a nosedive. He has always been less able to/interested in fitting in with the local school kids, his 13yo bro is more able to get out there and skateboard, hockey, joke around. Isa really doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe plays WOW a lot, level 80 tank and now taking his own groups through Naxxramas, so mixing with people in their 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s on WOW. He confidently does that, though sometimes it involves staying up till 12 or 1am, which seems to leave him a bit spaced out and sensitive the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis other interest is aggressive skating, though with osteopenia from celiac he needs to be careful and now he seems to be lacking confidence, cried today that his neighbour, B, 14yo is good at everything, another friend D, teases him. So now he is getting left behind when the boys go off to skate, and won&#39;t go find them, will go off to his room and cry or read.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is, what can I do to help him?? He got on great with a bunch of unschoolers at the water park, but we don&#39;t have that round here on a day to day basis for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI struggled most of my life with not &quot;fitting in&quot; but not liking to be alone either. He does not try to &quot;be&quot; someone he is not, which I think is good, but it leaves him a bit isolated and lonely.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas??<br/>\nCara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39157,"nextTopicId":39162}}
