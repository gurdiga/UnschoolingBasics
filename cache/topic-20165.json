I am tending more towards unschooling but my husband is dragging his feet a little. At the moment here (we live in Australia) it is Christmas holiday period with the schools so he is relaxed and I am taking every opportunity to point out when they learn something or improve a skill so he can begin to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to comment on the current discussion of whether or not to set limits on gaming. I am personally inclined to say that there SHOULD be limits. In my experience, if there are no limits then when does the gamer do anything else? My brother (will be 25 in April) started gaming (I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s WoW or something similar) when he was waiting for major surgery on his knee. He had dropped out of school due to medical reasons (I say dropped out because he had intended to stay there). It is now almost 3 years since the operation and he is still an avid gamer. So much so that it literally runs his life. The people who he games with are largely based in the USA so he has essentially become nocturnal. My brother has no income and lives with my Dad who is on a pension. He eats poorly as making mac and cheese or a microwaved burger takes up less of his gaming time. My brother has no intention of getting a job, no motivation to do so when his time is so filled with enjoyment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game has literally become his life; or vice versa, I&#39;m not sure. I don&#39;t think that that is something that should be encouraged and I don&#39;t know how you could discourage it without setting limits on gaming time, or mandatory requirements that other things be done before the gaming begins for the day, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nKindest Wishes,<br/>\nAnita<br/>\n(Mum to Liam 9 and Rhiannan 7)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Ren Allen <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, January 03, 2007 2:01 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: unschooling world of warcraft guild<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~It is difficult to get him off the game when I need help<br/>\n  with something without hearing &#39;I can&#39;t help you now...I&#39;m in an<br/>\n  instance&#39; or something similar.&gt;~~<br/>\n<br/>\n  Would you want to be interrupted if you were doing something that was<br/>\n  totally fascinating, fulfilling and enjoyable?

But I know a bit of the game. It is <br/>\nan amazingly complicated game with so much going on that it is easy to sit <br/>\ndown and spend a day or two days or a week moving through quest after quest, <br/>\nfinding the perfect armor for your character, mastering the art of herbalism <br/>\nand potion making, perfecting your polymorphism, learning how to blacksmith <br/>\nor mine. And there is so much communication and so much helpfulness. If I&#39;m <br/>\ngetting bested by some monster or another, running in the direction of some <br/>\nother player is likely to get me help. And I&#39;m likely to help someone else <br/>\nas well. It is a fantastically altruistic world.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay it before you limit your son.

If you want to read it: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion/browse_thread/thread/c82284b55aac1242/099eda5ec174f122?hl=en#099eda5ec174f122\">http://groups.google.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion/browse_thread/thread/c82284b55aac1242/099eda5ec174f122?hl=en#099eda5ec174f122</a><br/>\nI think the list may be accessible without membership.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut really, don&#39;t limit your son without knowing why he might love it so. Is <br/>\nlimiting it helping him to really love other things? Or is he increasingly <br/>\nanxious to get home to play the little bits of time he&#39;s being allowed? Is <br/>\nit helping your relationship with him to talk in degrading terms about the <br/>\nthing that he loves? Maybe if you embraced  WoW with him not only would you <br/>\ncome to find value in it but, since it isn&#39;t something that he&#39;ll have to <br/>\nleave, his interest in other things might return. If you move some activity <br/>\nthat could be joyful and interesting to the land of addiction than your son <br/>\nmight just embrace it as if it were an addiction. Because you hate it, and I <br/>\nam sure he knows that, there may be a sense that it is a limited time offer <br/>\nand he may be treating it as such. But he may not be. It isn&#39;t a limited <br/>\ntime deal for me, and I&#39;ve really spent the last couple of days playing <br/>\npretty much all day.
