Sam is a story teller, he is so  <br/>\namazing. He can create fantastical amazing plots and subplots, and  <br/>\nwithout much forethought, an amazing end. He adds visual imagery that  <br/>\nis quite specific, and changes his voice to a deep lyrical chant  <br/>\n(almost, as deep and lyrical as a 5yo can get, i guess) I enjoyed his  <br/>\nstories so much that I started writing them down. He seemed okay with  <br/>\nit for a while, but then one day took my face in both his hands and  <br/>\ncame very close. &quot;Just LISTEN to me, just hear my story.&quot; Dictation  <br/>\nis not always what it&#39;s cracked up to be either. We&#39;re compromising,  <br/>\nI listen, and sometimes he says I may write them down as we go, and  <br/>\nsometimes I can ask him later for specifics if I&#39;m trying to recall  <br/>\ncertain details.
