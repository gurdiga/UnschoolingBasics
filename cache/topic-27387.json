My <br/>\nhusband would not read, discuss or ponder out loud anything with me <br/>\nwhen it came to homeschooling or unschooling.

Duck, cover Â– incoming!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I began applying the same principles of unschooling/mindful <br/>\nparenting with my DH, only then did I see huge changes.  Things like, <br/>\ntrust.  Trust that he is doing his absolute best everyday.  Trust <br/>\nthat he wants the absolute best for his child.  Trust that he will <br/>\nlearn in time in HIS way.  Model the absolute best parenting for <br/>\nhim.  Be all the things you imagine you would like to see in him <br/>\nwithout calling attention to it.  He is probably copying the <br/>\nparenting style that was modeled for him from his parents.  Think of <br/>\nmodeling a new parenting style that he can consider. RELAX.  Relax <br/>\nwhen he falters and says something to your daughter that makes you <br/>\ncringe.  As Kelly Lovejoy says, consider that a `learning take&#39;. In <br/>\nthose moments, give him as much compassion as you would give your <br/>\nchild.  Don&#39;t put yourself in the middle as if you are some kind of <br/>\nreferee.  Trust your daughter too.  Children are made of tuff <br/>\nstuff.   She will let her dad know in one way or another that he <br/>\nneeds a different approach (She will also let him know when he is <br/>\ndoing the right things.)   As much as we would like for things to be <br/>\nperfect for our children, they can navigate this world just fine even <br/>\nwith a few bumps in the road.  You will likely get there quicker <br/>\nhowever, the more YOU trust, model and relax.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He has said a couple of things<br/>\nthat make me really think that we are just too different to do this<br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n&lt;<br/>\nThe things he says now when he is in a stressed state and perhaps <br/>\nfeeling a little under the microscope are unlikely to be the things <br/>\nhe would say if he felt more trusted.

And I listened to him about too much gaming and messy<br/>\nhouse and how&#39;s our boy going to learn to write? and how we don&#39;t have<br/>\nany schedules for laundry or dishes or dinner in our house and we<br/>\ndon&#39;t even brush our teeth everyday! And he brought up friends of our<br/>\nson who have majorly scheduled lives who eat whatever&#39;s on the plate<br/>\nin front of them and get dressed all by themselves etc etc. So I took<br/>\na turn and pointed out that those kids are have total problems<br/>\nnormally called &quot;not listening&quot; but it&#39;s more like they get no help<br/>\nfrom their folks and it&#39;s the parents who aren&#39;t listening actually. I<br/>\nsaid, here we have a boy who&#39;s really happy and trusts us and knows he<br/>\ncan depend on us. he wrote a letter to his friend when we sent them<br/>\nsome applesauce just the other day---of his own volition.

I think I&#39;m understanding a little better.  You are<br/>\ndefinitely right, I should try to get DH involved by using the term<br/>\nmindful parenting instead of unschooling.  But I do think it&#39;s time to<br/>\nworry about unschooling, because I also have a 4 year old dd from my<br/>\nprevious relationship, and he is having a seriously difficult time<br/>\nwith her.  He&#39;s always having power struggles with her, and it&#39;s<br/>\ndriving me mad.  If I ask her to do something (or not to do something)<br/>\nand she says &quot;NO,&quot; I normally try to work it out, when appropriate.  A<br/>\nlot of times I just let it go, if it&#39;s not causing anyone physical<br/>\nharm.  I&#39;m trying to let go of my control freak impulses.  But he<br/>\ntalks over me while I&#39;m trying to problem-solve, saying, &quot;NO, you<br/>\nlisten to your mother, you don&#39;t argue with her, you just do what she<br/>\nsays, ALWAYS, or [insert random threat here.]&quot;  He thinks he&#39;s<br/>\nhelping, but he&#39;s really taking us back a few steps each time he does<br/>\nthis. (I have started to tell him, &quot;Look.  I&#39;m on it.&quot;)  It&#39;s hard to<br/>\nfigure out where to begin with him.  I try to email him links but he<br/>\nnever says whether or not he got them or checked them out.  When I<br/>\ntalk to him he&#39;s pretty unresponsive.  He has said a couple of things<br/>\nthat make me really think that we are just too different to do this<br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  We were at his parent&#39;s house for dinner.  DD was sitting on<br/>\nher legs, then standing on her knees in the chair, not really eating,<br/>\nsort of singing randomly, and we were trying to get her to settle into<br/>\nthe chair and eat something.  She settles down but is still sitting on<br/>\none leg.  He starts to tell her that she needs to sit down ALL THE<br/>\nWAY.  I said, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, she&#39;s eating now,&quot; and he said, &quot;I<br/>\nknow you&#39;re sitting there thinking that you have to pick your battles,<br/>\nbut what you don&#39;t understand is that you can pick them ALL, ALL the<br/>\ntime.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo.  You know.  Dang.  What do you do with THAT?????  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I&#39;m not making him out to be a monster, because our<br/>\nrelationship isn&#39;t all that bad.  He fawns over his baby boy.  He&#39;s<br/>\nalso been unemployed for almost a year and is really stressed about<br/>\nwhere the next rent payment will come from.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very helpful to think in terms of mindful parenting.  That will<br/>\nhopefully help him deal better with DD.  I am so tired of the<br/>\nauthoritarian vibe in my house!

What you&#39;ve been doing is basically what any parent of an under <br/>\ntwo would do---playing with him and engaging with him. But by allowing <br/>\nhim freedom (within reason! &lt;G&gt;) and trusting and respecting him, even <br/>\nat this very young age, you are setting up a loving <br/>\nunschooling-friendly household already!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n We color together, I let him scrub the floor with a wet rag<br/>\nthe other night (which he enjoyed to no end!), I give him balls of<br/>\nyarn which he happily unravels like a kitten, his father and I are<br/>\nvery attentive and playful with him.  We don&#39;t get out much, but any<br/>\nmore than we do is relatively impossible.  Is it not unschooling<br/>\nbefore you just start calling it that?  Or do you mean he&#39;s too young<br/>\nto be technically called unschooled?  I feel like I&#39;m REALLY missing<br/>\nsomething here.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nRight---he&#39;s not even school age. So how can he be unschooled if he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t be schooled? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s more just attachment parenting, really. But you can start setting <br/>\nup the environment (AND your attitude) for unschooling and simply <br/>\ne-a-s-e into unschooling as a way of life without all the school <br/>\nbaggage that would come along in a few years.<br/>\n<br/>\nMnay parents say they&#39;re unschooling their toddlers. THen the toddlers <br/>\nbecome preschoolers---still &quot;unschooling&quot;---but when the children <br/>\nbecome school age, the parents send the kids to school. SO....were they <br/>\nactually unschooling? or were they just playing with their toddlers and <br/>\nrealizing that they&#39;re learning all the time before they decide to send <br/>\nthem to school?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you understand the philosophy, I think it&#39;s OK to say that you&#39;re <br/>\nunschooling. If you&#39;re just doing what any parent of a toddler would do <br/>\nbut then cave and send him to school as soon as he is school age <br/>\nbecause you think he needs &quot;an education&quot;---that&#39;s really just being <br/>\nthe parent of a toddler! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-==<br/>\n<br/>\nI will join the AlwaysUnschooled list as well, thanks for the <br/>\nsuggestion.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah---Danielle and crew can help you see how to keep on doing what <br/>\nyou&#39;re doing as he grows.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing-- my husband and I differ on a couple of issues.<br/>\nBooBear will climb up on the table and I&#39;m fine with that if it&#39;s<br/>\ncleared of things that could hurt him.  But DH thinks that by letting<br/>\nhim do this that I am &quot;encouraging him to climb on the table even when<br/>\nthere is stuff there that he doesn&#39;t need to get into.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of people think that, because toddlers don&#39;t speak, they <br/>\ncan&#39;t understand. Duncan *loved* to stand on tables---he liked being <br/>\n&quot;big.&quot; But, as you said, it&#39;s not always practical. But I would try to <br/>\nmake the area suitable for him if I could. I&#39;d clear it and *say*, &quot;Now <br/>\nyou may come on up!&quot; If I couldn&#39;t (at Grandma&#39;s, decorated for <br/>\nChristmas dinner, for example) I&#39;d tell him that it wasn&#39;t possible <br/>\nhere now, but then we&#39;d try to find somewhere more appropiate. Because <br/>\nhe knew I would help him stand and dance on tables when I could, he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t wang out when he couldn&#39;t. It wasn&#39;t long before he&#39;d *ask* with <br/>\na questioning look or maybe &quot;Table dance?&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they know that we will help them reach their goals whenever we <br/>\n*can*, they&#39;re more liekly to agree *not* to when we really, really <br/>\ncan&#39;t. They&#39;re pretty reasonable when they know we&#39;re working *with* <br/>\nthem! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard people on this list say that they had a hard time getting<br/>\ntheir little one to stop running in the road, but then they just let<br/>\nthem do it when it was safe, and they got bored with it soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe on another list. I don&#39;t think *anyone* here has said that. What <br/>\nhas been said is that, when a parent says that playing in the street is <br/>\nnot safe,...well, that&#39;s a statement that&#39;s not necessarily true. If a <br/>\nchild can play in the street and not get hurt, was the parent *lying&quot;*? <br/>\nMistaken? Being a control freak? When a child can prove the parent <br/>\nwrong *once*, why shouldn&#39;t that child question everything the parent <br/>\nsays?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Drugs kill&quot;---or at least &quot;drugs are dangerous.&quot; But then a friend of <br/>\nthe child&#39;s smokes weed and doesn&#39;t die, who&#39;s doing the lying? When <br/>\nthe child smokes weed and isn&#39;t harmed (but had a good time), why <br/>\nshould the child trust the parent&#39;s judgment?<br/>\n<br/>\nStreet&#39;s aren&#39;t necessariily dangerous. I used to play kickball on our <br/>\nstreet. We would get out of the way when cars drove by. Kids *can* play <br/>\nin streets. Sometimes they are safe. Sometimes they are not. Knowing <br/>\nthe difference is the important thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes tables are a great place to play. Sometimes they are not. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nKnowing that our moms will help us play up there when it *is* safe is <br/>\nthe important thing!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\n   That&#39;s how I think it works.  It makes him happy to be on the table.  <br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\npreventing him from falling.  I shouldn&#39;t tell him not to do it when<br/>\nthere is no harm.  Right?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp him understand *when* it&#39;s appropriate and when it&#39;s not.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;m trying to NO AVAIL to get my hubby to<br/>\nread up on some of this mindful parenting/unschool stuff, but he keeps<br/>\nsaying Boo Bear is just a baby, we don&#39;t need to worry about that yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk him when it will be the &quot;right&quot; time. What&#39;s the magic age? Four? <br/>\nfive? nine? fifteen?<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, he&#39;s *ALREADY* a parent. So a parent is what he already IS. <br/>\nWhen does he think will be the right time to be a better parent?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we DO need to worry about it now!  He&#39;s so impressionable now,<br/>\nand I want to take the best path possible for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nParents only get one take---Childhood is NOT a dress rehearsal! THis is <br/>\nthe one chance you get to be the best parent to that child that you can <br/>\nbe. Why waste it?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think that was the gist of my original post-- that I was<br/>\nwondering if it&#39;s ::called::  unschooling when they are so small, and<br/>\nif so, how people are going about doing that, and how that contrasts<br/>\nwith what I&#39;m already doing.  Just for curiosity&#39;s sake.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this age, it&#39;s probably best called mindful parenting---and that can <br/>\ncontinue right on up until your child is a grandparent himself. That <br/>\nway your husband doesn&#39;t have to wait until your child is school-age. <br/>\nHe&#39;s a parent *now*, so it&#39;s a good time to start being a mindful, <br/>\nbetter one. Worry about the &quot;unschooling&quot; later! It&#39;ll happen (to <br/>\nborrow from Joyce) as a side-effect of mindful parenting! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nEmail and AIM finally together.

I&#39;m not sure what<br/>\nunschooling a child under 2 *means*, if it&#39;s not what I was already<br/>\ndoing.  We color together, I let him scrub the floor with a wet rag<br/>\nthe other night (which he enjoyed to no end!), I give him balls of<br/>\nyarn which he happily unravels like a kitten, his father and I are<br/>\nvery attentive and playful with him.  We don&#39;t get out much, but any<br/>\nmore than we do is relatively impossible.  Is it not unschooling<br/>\nbefore you just start calling it that?  Or do you mean he&#39;s too young<br/>\nto be technically called unschooled?

Sometimes he grabs<br/>\nsomething that we have failed to pick up-- a knitting needle,<br/>\nsomething made of glass which he is banging on the tile floor, or<br/>\nsomething jagged and boo-boo causing-- or he&#39;ll try to grab the plugs<br/>\nin the outlets.  We do make a HUGE effort to not leave those things<br/>\nlaying around, and to baby-proof the house, but there will be slip-ups<br/>\nsometimes.  It seems harsh to just yell &quot;NO!&quot; at him. Pam said that I<br/>\nwas making the items seem more enticing by taking them from him, which<br/>\nis very true.  I feel like yelling &quot;NO&quot; at him will also make them<br/>\nmore enticing, or sometimes he just bursts into tears and it&#39;s heart<br/>\nwrenching!  He&#39;s also been doing rather annoying things like banging<br/>\nhis juice cup into my monitor or the TV or my guitar (cringe!!!), and<br/>\nit&#39;s quite funny to him when we try to stop him.  This is where<br/>\ndistraction comes in, I&#39;m guessing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing-- my husband and I differ on a couple of issues. <br/>\nBooBear will climb up on the table and I&#39;m fine with that if it&#39;s<br/>\ncleared of things that could hurt him.

It seems to me that the most <br/>\nstimulating thing was ME. It doesn&#39;t matter what we do, but being with sister or me doing <br/>\nANYTHING was what she needed. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for activities, she just gets carried along on all the big kids stuff. We just honor what <br/>\nshe needs to do on those visits to the zoo, museums and libraries. Hiking, climbing, <br/>\nminigolf. But she&#39;s always loved tagging along in her sling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for TV, she&#39;s always had the TV on and seems just like the other kids. My six yo and <br/>\nfour yo, same thing. Eyes are genetic, and I have seen kids who never watch TV need <br/>\nglasses, and those who watch all the time never need them. Our boys all have glasses now, <br/>\ngenetic from me...so I can skip the middle man and blame myself lol!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for danger, it&#39;s so relative ;-) Not helpful, but I&#39;ve done what you mentioned, minimized <br/>\ndangerous things. Then reassessed what was dangerous. I&#39;ve helped her with things that <br/>\nare truly dangerous, and provided alternatives with things that are just out of my comfort <br/>\nlevel. I always tell my kids not that something is &#39;too dangerous&#39;, but that it&#39;s out of my <br/>\ncomfort level and ask what we could do about it. They usually want to wait for dad, who&#39;s <br/>\ncoping is much higher than mine. One example I can think of, is using knives. To me, <br/>\nthose kid knives are so much more dangerous, they have to saw at anything outside of a <br/>\nbanana, so I was much more comfortable teaching her to use a serrated knife with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of it is her being number seven, without that I probably would have had more trouble <br/>\nletting go.
