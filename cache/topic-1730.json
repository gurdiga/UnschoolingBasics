This is how it is for me.<br/>\n While my husband is supportive, he is constantly pressured, quizzed and<br/>\nlectured by his family about unschooling and often needs *my* support to<br/>\nwithstand the garbage dump of their inner fears.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why there are unschooling lists where people can be engaged with<br/>\nlike minded individuals.   This is why I don&#39;t wade through the thousands<br/>\nof general homeschooling lists.

You still<br/>\nhave the freedom and power to live any life you want to with your kid.  <br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter what your family says, what your community says, what<br/>\nwe say.  You are not the victim of any mysterious mental control from<br/>\nthis list.  You get to do whatever you want.  You get to think and <br/>\nbelieve whatever you want.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut this list *is* for talking about the very basics of the unschooling<br/>\nphilosophy and building a foundation in unschooling.   That&#39;s what we&#39;ll<br/>\ntalk about here and you are free to use the parts you feel good about and<br/>\nleave the parts you don&#39;t behind.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been out camping and hiking - on and off over the last few weeks and<br/>\nI&#39;m hundreds of e-mails behind.

Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve come up with...<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s say that I jump out from behind a door and yell &quot;Boo!&quot; at two<br/>\nchildren.  One is scared and cries.  The other one yells &quot;Boo&quot; back, laughs<br/>\nand thinks it&#39;s a great game.  Obviously I did one action and got two<br/>\nresponses.  I did not pick the feelings or reactions of each child.  They<br/>\nreacted as they did due to who they were and their perception of what I did.<br/>\nDoes that mean that the reaction of the child who cried is &quot;her problem&quot;?<br/>\nDoes that mean that I do not feel responsible for the impact of my yelling<br/>\n&quot;boo&quot; on the child who cried?  Absolutely not!!  I would consider myself<br/>\nresponsible for choosing the action, I would feel responsible for it&#39;s<br/>\nimpact and so I&#39;d feel responsible to comfort the child and talk to them<br/>\nabout their feelings and needs.  But there is no direct causal relationship<br/>\nto the feelings.  We do not control one anothers feelings like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case this is an issue for you, Kimmy, with the strong reaction you&#39;ve had<br/>\nto these threads, I see this is true of my own upbringing too.  I was raised<br/>\nin an emotionally abusive environment.  The things my parents chose to do<br/>\nhad a tremendously negative impact on me.  Are my parents responsible for<br/>\nthat?  Hell yes.  They are responsible for choosing their actions.  They are<br/>\nresponsible for the impact those actions had (that&#39;s not to say they have<br/>\ntaken any responsibility, but it is to say that I feel they are responsible<br/>\nfor that).  They did not however choose my feelings in response to what they<br/>\ndid.  Those came from how I perceived what they did and from my own<br/>\npersonality.  If you asked my siblings, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d express different<br/>\nemotions and perceptions from the same experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Non-Violent Communication and Children","postDate":"1089650314","msgId":1897,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkOC4yNjBlNjI1ZC4yZTI0MTg4YUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":1894,"nextInTopic":1901,"prevInTime":1896,"nextInTime":1898,"topicId":1730,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/12/2004 12:26:58 PM Eastern Daylight Time, valerie@ubpub.com writes: I think  it s a bad idea to have her do something because it makes ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-121091736\">In a message dated 7/12/2004 12:26:58 PM Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:valerie@...\">valerie@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nI think  it&#39;s a bad idea to have her do something because it makes <br/>\nmommy  feel  better.

Instead of saying &quot;GO AWAY&quot;, could you say &#39;Mommy, I&#39;m in the middle of a project!, instead?&quot;<br/>\nThis both helps me hear &quot;GO AWAY&quot; for what it really is, and helps my daughter understand how to reframe her needs in a way that is easier for me (and others) to hear and respond to what she needs. <br/>\nJen<br/>\n--<br/>\n&quot;Out there things can happen and <br/>\nfrequently do <br/>\nto people as brainy and footsy as <br/>\nyou.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s a bad idea to have her do something because it makes mommy <br/>\n&gt; feel <br/>\n&gt; better. She&#39;s not responsible for your feelings. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe &quot;Mommy does it to make herself feel better! I think I&#39;ll help because <br/>\n&gt; it makes me feel good too.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wanted to chime in here because I have been using some NVC techniques <br/>\n&gt; myself and I know Jen (Hi, Jen!) ... I completely agree with what Kelly is <br/>\n&gt; saying about the danger of having our children feel responsible for our <br/>\n&gt; feelings. I would never want my kids to feel like they are doing something <br/>\n&gt; because they are &quot;making&quot; mommy feel bad by not doing it or &quot;making&quot; me <br/>\n&gt; happy by doing it. I do want to say that my perception of NVC, and the way <br/>\n&gt; I use it, has nothing to do with responsibility for the feelings of others. <br/>\n&gt; NVC works off the belief that all of us, children and adults, act in <br/>\n&gt; accordance with our needs and the needs of others. So when I use NVC with <br/>\n&gt; my children, for me, it&#39;s about setting aside &quot;It&#39;s time to clean up now&quot; <br/>\n&gt; and telling them about whatever my need is about cleaning up. That gives my <br/>\n&gt; child a choice to respond to my expressed need. It also opens up the lines <br/>\n&gt; of communication so that they can express their needs and we can see if we <br/>\n&gt; can get all of our needs met together in some way. If they say no, it&#39;s not <br/>\n&gt; that they&#39;ve made me feel bad and it&#39;s okay for them to say no. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, to turn the situation around and look at my child&#39;s request to me...if <br/>\n&gt; my child for instance comes to me late at night to ask me to play a long <br/>\n&gt; barbie game for the zillionth time that day and I&#39;m really tired, I may say <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Gosh, I&#39;m really tired. Let&#39;s play it tomorrow.&quot; My child may be okay <br/>\n&gt; with that, or they may say &quot;No, mom. I really need to play it again. <br/>\n&gt; Please...&quot; etcetera. I as a person have a choice to hear their need and put <br/>\n&gt; aside my tiredness to meet that need because I love my child and it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; important to me to try to meet her needs. That&#39;s healthy in my opinion. <br/>\n&gt; IF, however, I feel somehow responsible for my child&#39;s happiness...ie I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; thinking that my child&#39;s unhappiness at my saying after hearing her out &quot;no, <br/>\n&gt; I AM really too tired&quot; is my responsibility...and that conversely I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; responsible for her happiness if I do it, then I&#39;m in trouble. Then I am in <br/>\n&gt; the position of feeling that her feelings are &quot;forcing&quot; me to do things. <br/>\n&gt; This is not &quot;choice&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I see the same thing to be true conversely for my kids. They should not <br/>\n&gt; feel they are responsible for how I feel, but I can express my needs, have a <br/>\n&gt; conversation, and give them a choice to try to meet those needs if I can <br/>\n&gt; express them at an age appropriate level and without loaded stuff like <br/>\n&gt; anger. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope that makes sense! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Joan <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

You are all a very thoughtful and articulate group of people, and it is wonderful to hear how much energy and creativity you put into parenting.<br/>\nThere was a discussion thread about &quot;demands&quot; disguised as &quot;requests&quot; and it is something that I&#39;ve been struggling with. I found your reminders to &quot;really let kids say no&quot; to be very helpful. I&#39;d like to add that I&#39;ve found that phrasing things using non-violent communication also goes a long way toward owning my own feelings instead of making authoritarian statements and it also helps my kids (and husband) understand clearly the impact their actions have on me. In short, NVC is objectively stating what you see, telling the other person how it makes you feel using I statements, telling them why you feel that way, and then telling them what you need. An example with Bethan (3.25).<br/>\nOld way: <br/>\nMe: I&#39;d like you to pick up your toys. I&#39;m happy to help you.<br/>\nBethan: I don&#39;t want to.<br/>\nMe: Picks up toys with or without help, but feels resentful.<br/>\nWith NVC.<br/>\nMe: When I see your toys on the floor, I worry that someone might trip on them and get hurt, and your toys might get broken. I&#39;m going to pick them up to keep everyone safe. Would you like to help me?<br/>\nBethan: &quot;I would be sad if someone got hurt, and I like my toys so I don&#39;t want them to get broken.&quot; (Helps pick up). Or..&quot;I think people should watch out where they&#39;re walking so they don&#39;t break my toys or get hurt.&quot; (Doesn&#39;t help and I pick up).<br/>\nThe difference here is how *I* feel about the process, I have a need for order, I&#39;m the one who&#39;s worried about the toys, so I am going to do something about it. Also, Bethan responds to &quot;I&#39;m doing this because it helps mommy feel better.&quot; Rather than &quot;I&#39;m doing this because it&#39;s the &quot;rule&quot; or the &quot;right thing to do&quot; is to keep clean.<br/>\nDoes that make sense at all? Anyway, maybe not the best example of NVC, but I think it&#39;s a wonderful communication tool.<br/>\nJen <br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n&quot;Out there things can happen and <br/>\nfrequently do <br/>\nto people as brainy and footsy as <br/>\nyou.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1836,"nextTopicId":1970}}
