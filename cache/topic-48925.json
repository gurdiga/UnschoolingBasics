(Not because they&#39;re noble! They need to be because they&#39;re depending on their parents.) If 99% of the time they experience mom as their partner in getting their needs met, the 1% when mom fails won&#39;t have a lasting impact. The greater that second percentage grows, though, -- 5%, 10% it depends on the child -- the less they&#39;ll trust.

I understand that moments away have value. But I learned, to my advantage, that the more I held on for time away, for an hour, just an hour, to myself, the less I enjoyed my moments with Simon and Linnaea. I also found that it rarely recharged me enough to feel better when I came back. I kept wanting more time away. It was so much more refreshing, so much more fulfilling when I figured out how to enjoy being with them and how to relax in the moments, the little moments when I could sit and breathe, even with Simon or Linnaea sitting on my lap, even when playing with dolls or stuffed animals or lego or b&#39;daman. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you can figure out how to bring someone in, how to get an hour away it can be helpful, but it won&#39;t fix it.

This chosen moment with Simon or with Linnaea.

Taking 15 minutes, or even an hour, or a day, away from our children is certainly not in most cases &quot;meeting our needs at their expense&quot;- particularly with older children (though I could certainly see the argument in the case of infants and toddlers who are much more dependent on us....but even then, they generally nap at some point).   Walking away if you&#39;re about to dump your feelings all over your kids I think is a preferable solution to actually dumping on them.....especially if you can make it clear that you&#39;re doing so because you&#39;re taking responsibility for your own feelings.  We can make sure their needs are met AND meet our own needs, which for some parents definitely involves time apart (introverts and empaths in particular)...and I think often becomes more needed for these parents AFTER children leave babyhood.  This is so much easier when there is a partner involved to be present with the children when mom is not .... but there are alternatives that don&#39;t come down to someone&#39;s needs getting met and someone else&#39;s not.  Digging in and moving deeper into the connection IS a great thing.  And it can be particularly useful in those moments when you&#39;re ready to yell, or run away, or just use control....unless you just can&#39;t get yourself there.  Then again, it&#39;s probably better done BEFORE any of those things occurs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s also important, if you are someone who does need time away, to find ways to meet that need proactively....to not be waiting until you hit that breaking point.  To not be blaming your children for the fact that you&#39;re someone who thrives on time alone (or with cognitive and intellectual peers, for the extrovert).  Be aware of your needs, meet them before they become so desperate that you can&#39;t function.  Yes, multiple children and single parenting make this more difficult- but you can&#39;t give what you don&#39;t have.  The hardest thing is when a parent allows herself to become so tapped out that almost nothing seems to fill the well.  When you&#39;re in that position, its important to remember that it&#39;s a slow recovery process....and again, skills like digging in deeper, being present in the moment, feeling your feelings without beating up on yourself for having them, are so necessary.  At least in my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is such a case by case thing, dependent on the parents and the children involved....none of us is exactly the same.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLesley <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://euphorialifedesignstudio.com\">http://euphorialifedesignstudio.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":418152252,"authorName":"Katherine","from":"&quot;Katherine&quot; &lt;kchavener@...&gt;","profile":"kchavener@att.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Frustrated - yelled at kids.","postDate":"1345156394","msgId":48936,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGswanNmYSs5NWMwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGswaHRyMythYTVxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48933,"nextInTopic":48937,"prevInTime":48935,"nextInTime":48937,"topicId":48925,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I only have three children, but I too have had many nights like this.

And they happen when I am completely tapped out, when I&#39;m out of balance.  With all due respect to those that have responded already, the very last thing that I need in times like that is more time with my children.  I am a proud and unabashed long time homeschooler (though new to unschooling) and attachment parent, but I absolutely need time to myself to stay balanced and sane. A few weeks ago, I was feeling totally out of whack, was yelling like you say you were. I told my husband I was going to take a walk - and I walked to the creek by our house and then sat - meditating, being in the quiet, beautiful nature - by myself for an hour.  And I felt SO amazingly good.  It quickly brought me back to center where I need to be to be the best mother I can be.  I also have a mothers helper that comes in a few hours once a week or so - and I use that time to sleep, or read, or play on the computer, or walk, or whatever I want. For me.<br/>\nAs a mom, I&#39;m an important part of the equation.. my needs are important too. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do get and understand that there are many times in parenting where we don&#39;t think we can do it (like handling night waking babies, or children that won&#39;t nap, or children that don&#39;t want to go to bed at night) - and then, with time, with understanding, with just getting more relaxed at life - we realize we can.  However, 9 years into parenting, I still find in my own life that there are times when to maintain my center, I MUST have time for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I want you to know that you&#39;re not alone, and that if you can find time for yourself by finding a mother&#39;s helper (know any youngsters or have any family that can help for a few hours?) - it sounds like you could use a break.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there mama and please be gentle with yourself.  <br/>\n<br/>\n- Katherine Havener</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Frustrated - yelled at kids.","postDate":"1345153994","msgId":48933,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNDUxNTM5OTQuNTMwMTYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjg3OTA0Lm1haWwuaXIyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGswaXRqNyszb2pxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGswaW1vOCtsY3BmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8azBpdGo3KzNvanFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":48932,"nextInTopic":48936,"prevInTime":48932,"nextInTime":48934,"topicId":48925,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://sandradodd.com/bonding  may be along the lines of what Caren was thinking about.

I know I write about it frequently. I&#39;m glad that she likes it. I&#39;m glad that it helps. It helps me to remember that being present, being with Simon and Linnaea is a pleasure, is a good and sweet and wonderful thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can remember to the moment when I first made a real choice to turn away from ideas of me time and turned toward Simon and Linnaea. We were playing a game and I was thinking about doing the dishes and making food and something else. I wasn&#39;t really there. I was worried about other things. And I stopped, and I shut up the list in my head and I played the game. I paid attention to all the details I could in that moment. Linnaea and her scattered and wild hair and the way that Simon talks and the feel of the painted concrete floor that was our living room on my legs. It was just a moment. But it was a moment of being really present. And it was relaxing and engaging in a way that my lists of what to do next playing through my head never are. That kind of being present is a skill, a muscle and it needs to be worked and worked again to get it to happen without so much effort each time. But when you get it going, when you start paying attention to what is in<br/>\n front of you, it is really pretty incredible. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: CarenKH &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:carenkh@...\">carenkh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Thursday, 16 August 2012, 23:46<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Frustrated - yelled at kids.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=-=Maybe figure out a way, if you can, to tell the kids you need 15 minutes to sit quietly sometimes.

I have screamed at my kids more tonight than I have in a long time.  I knew as I was doing it that I shouldn&#39;t...but I was so angry that I did anyway.  If I had had a paddle, I would have used it on them.  (I threw it away recently)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I can do this.  I want to relax my parenting and say yes more.  I&#39;ve been letting them stay up later and play xbox or watch tv...but when does mom get some down time?  Tonight I was trying to watch one show on tv, and they were fighting and screaming and fighting and I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore!!!  I just wanted them to be quiet!!!  I ended up sticking everyone into bed angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan a single mom of six do this?  I&#39;ve seen so many good things, particularly lately as I am trying to notice learning more.  We spontaneously played a rhyming game yesterday.  At first my 7 yo couldn&#39;t pick out words that rhymed, but by the end, it was easy for him.  Today they built a volcano in the sand box.  My 7 yo is digging up various plants all around the yard and making his own garden.  All these things I see so much learning in and strewing possibilities...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why am I so down?  Why do I feel like a total loser who is never going to get this? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo frustrated with myself,<br/>\nKristie<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - My 5 yo discovered the power of his middle finger.
