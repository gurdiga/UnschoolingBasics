We <br/>\nhave been very clear with the kids to respect anyone who is asleep, <br/>\na baby, a dad, a mom. Sleep is valued. That being said, in the <br/>\nmornings we also have some who sleep later and we keep the <br/>\nactivities quiet until everyone is awake.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this looks like is Tim (dh) in bed, often with my 9 year old <br/>\nson sleeping too. My 12 year old dd stays up in her room, quietly <br/>\nreading or on the computer or watching TV, all quiet, no blaring <br/>\nloud music and dancing around the house at 11 pm. Last night she <br/>\nwanted to iron at midnight. I actually asked her to wait until the <br/>\nmorning, being that the openning and closing of the ironing board <br/>\nwould be noisy as would putting her clothes away. The closet is the <br/>\nwall where the sleeping people are.. Who knows a kid who wants to <br/>\niron their own clothes... That is another post all together. She&#39;s <br/>\nironing now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 6 year old is the night owl. She and I have evolved a very <br/>\nworkable routine. She quietly plays in her room, I lay down in <br/>\nanother room and when she is finally ready for sleep, I crawl into <br/>\nher bed and we sleep. I get anywhere from 15-45 minutes. i could <br/>\nread, but usually I meditate or just space or sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, when do Tim and I have time together? We take what we can get. <br/>\nSometimes it coffee and tea in the eveings while the kids play <br/>\nhappily. Sometimes it being together early in the morning. We don&#39;t <br/>\nwatch movies that the kids can&#39;t watch, we watch movies together. <br/>\nLast night Tim and I cuddled on the bed while the 2 little ones <br/>\nplayed game cube, so we were all together, yet having our own <br/>\nexperiences, yes G rated, but a back rub feels good no matter what.<br/>\n<br/>\nTim is very sweet and he knows there will be a time just around the <br/>\ncorner where we will be alone missing all this chaos. That helps a <br/>\nton. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would suggest finding out each persons needs and then looking <br/>\nat how to meet those needs. Yes, the baby needs to stay asleep, as <br/>\ndoes the 2 year old, maybe moving the TV in another space for those <br/>\nwho will be still awake, or get another TV. And remember your needs <br/>\nare important too, so how much time do you want separate how <br/>\nregualrly, what are you will to do to get that? We know a few <br/>\nfamilies who have a babysitting co-op. Each Friday night, 1 family <br/>\ntakes the kids, has movies, popcorn, fun together, the other <br/>\nfamilies have a free night to go out or stay in. Each family hosts 1 <br/>\ntime a month, so that leaves 3-4 Friday nights for adult time <br/>\ntogether. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\n<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle/Melbrigða","from":"&quot;=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Michelle/Melbrig=F0a?=&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] thanks again for super advice - ready for another about mommy/daddy time??","postDate":"1154876484","msgId":16326,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA4MDYwODAxbzYyNzRkODMzaDYwMjkwZjZiZmE4MThjOTVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDODg3NzVBQjYyRkNCQy0xODQtNDU4NEBtYmxrLXIzMy5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGViNG1sOCtzMXJpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDhDODg3NzVBQjYyRkNCQy0xODQtNDU4NEBtYmxrLXIzMy5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16320,"nextInTopic":16329,"prevInTime":16325,"nextInTime":16327,"topicId":16317,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
