Maybe you&#39;ll share my thoughts with him? <br/>\nI put a lot into school and I got a lot out of it. My top ten list of inspirational people would include five public school teachers.<br/>\n We started out as homeschoolers through a charter school. I wanted that doggone advisor to tell me how many hours we were supposed to do something, how many pages, and what the best way was to hammer it into her head. It took two years to realize I was trying to cram &quot;information&quot; into her head, not &quot;knowledge&quot; she actually needed. We would open up the social studies book and talk about community helpers when hello! We had already met them at different events, heard all the in-depth information straight from them, and had a blast. The social studies book was first to go. It didn&#39;t take me long to realize math curriculum is designed to be used by thirty children and English curriculum was full of stupid stories that the kid had no interest in. I had to work on MYSELF. I had to step back and try to realize how much I DIDN&#39;T remember from school. For a real mind trip- find an online sample test for your state&#39;s mandatory testing and see how well you can pass it (for any grade!). I don&#39;t remember this crap, but guess what? I&#39;m still an okay person! In fact, on paper, I&#39;m an excellent person! I&#39;m smart, I know what&#39;s going on in the world, I&#39;m stable, I volunteer, I&#39;m kind,  a good wife and mother, I function well in society, I&#39;m capable of holding down a career, etc. I learned absolutely none of these in school. I learned all of this through being a person, existing and participating in society, and maturing. <br/>\nI honestly believe that a child who is out of school learns these traits earlier. I don&#39;t think earlier is the goal, but if they&#39;re good people and citizens in their teens they will be excellent ones in their twenties! <br/>\nAll in all it took three years to get the devil out of me. We own curriculum, it&#39;s up to them if they want to pluck it off the shelf and go through it. When they ask me questions, we find the answer. We don&#39;t hold schedules or kill trees practicing rote-memory activities. There&#39;s simply not a need. The world is our classroom;  the bumper sticker on my truck declares it so! Lol! <br/>\nMy youngest is now kindergarten aged. An hour ago she brought down blocks (they are Math U See tiles we didn&#39;t use) and started stacking and counting them. She wanted to know what half of this hundred-tile was. We showed her how to find it and she figured it out herself. How could I spoil that self-driven discovery with a &quot;sit down, let&#39;s open up the book to page seventy. What is the answer to....? -I- personally can&#39;t. To me it is more important that a child cares about what they want to know rather than having an adult cram data in to their heads. <br/>\nIf nothing else, school as we know it is a relatively new invention. For 6,000 to 3,000,000 years, depending on your worldview, we have flourished as a human race with experience being our teacher. The greatest inventors and philosophers had nothing but equipment and experienced adults to work with and look where we are now! We are okay!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209361242,"authorName":"JJ","from":"&quot;JJ&quot; &lt;jrossedd@...&gt;","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: not anti-school","postDate":"1307982815","msgId":46869,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGl0NWU0dithc3V2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGl0NWJ0MithZzdmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46868,"nextInTopic":46885,"prevInTime":46868,"nextInTime":46870,"topicId":46863,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Lots to read at Dr. Peter Gray s Psychology Today blog (see the extensive comments for dozens of personal experiences) about the positives of learning without","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-106558385\">Lots to read at Dr. Peter Gray&#39;s Psychology Today blog (see the extensive comments for dozens of personal experiences) about the positives of learning without schooling for reading, math, science and critical thinking etc:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2010/02/26/children-teaching-themselves-to-read-psychology-today-post-goes-up/\">http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2010/02/26/children-teaching-themselves-to-read-psychology-today-post-goes-up/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201002/children-teach-themselves-read/\">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201002/children-teach-themselves-read/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2010/01/07/psychology-today-wants-unschooled-learning-stories/\">http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2010/01/07/psychology-today-wants-unschooled-learning-stories/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201004/kids-learn-math-easily-when-they-control-their-own-learning\">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201004/kids-learn-math-easily-when-they-control-their-own-learning</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;JJ&quot; &lt;jrossedd@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Can anyone share with me links about Unschooling, specifically the academic aspects, that aren&#39;t necessarily anti-school or contrasting school?

For me it was all exciting and absorbing very satisfying. I wanted to read and think and explore ideas, to know and do and be in all directions. I enjoyed it so much that I studied to become an education professional and didn&#39;t see any difference between school and education, thought of them as the same thing. But I&#39;ve come to understand that I was unusual to experience School and Education that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I want for my children is the loving of learning, the desire that leads education and living the life of the mind unbound -- not necessarily the Schooling, although if that works for them, fine. I was churched as a child and loved much of that in the same ways I did schooling. Now what I want for my children is ethical maturity, goodness, the morality and the communal comfort of connection with human transcendence -- whether or not they ever find any of it in Church.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool and Church are forms of institutional support for (and increasing authority over) something that only has meaning inside each individual. To criticize the institution of school or church isn&#39;t to be against education or ethics, learning or spiritual growth; indeed it&#39;s often the opposite, arising from those who care, who would defend and return focus to individual support when institutions disappoint or worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started to write about these differences between School and Education soon after our first child was born in 1990 (at 21 now, she does, too!)and perhaps in a way your DH would relate to?

Nadal&#39;s parents resisted that siren&#39;s song. He stayed close to home... far from the Nick Bollettieri-style compounds in Florida.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, Nadal grew up with dimension, was raised a chameleon... Nadal applied his eagerness to learn and adjust as he decoded the subtleties of grass during Wimbledon.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch court awareness isn&#39;t a virtue of American tennis academies.

What they need is support for the things they don&#39;t do as well on their own and schools don&#39;t provide those things. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbsorbing information effortlessly is why I did well in school too - but conversely why I struggled more after graduation. That ability didn&#39;t set me up well with real life skills; those are things I&#39;ve had to pick up on my own while un-learning a good many of my school skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat might come across as anti-school, but its one of the biggest criticisms of college professors and employers of young adults - and parents and teachers, too! Schools aren&#39;t designed to teach life skills and so they Can&#39;t, for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids can do well leaving school if they go right into a situation where they have something like mentorship - and smaller colleges, Vo-tech schools, and with academic fraternities are frequently set up to provide exactly that, but not all kids know to take advantage of those options. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids get a bit of mentorship in high-school, as well, via a favorite teacher, coach, or club leader. The trouble is, schools don&#39;t have the resources to provide that level of support to all students or even Most students. And you can&#39;t know which of your kids will get that kind of support in school and which won&#39;t. Kids who are very confident and self-assured can end up getting little to no support in the school system, for instance, because they seem to &quot;have it all together&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling sets kids up with the kind of support system that lets them learn real world skills with a much higher degree of safety and support sooner. It&#39;s an avenue whereby support can be targetted to the real needs of individuals. That&#39;s an educational ideal! Its what every (good) teacher would like for her or his students - individualized support. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be helpful to your husband if you did some research into the education of &quot;gifted&quot; kids because it tends to revolve around this very issue. &quot;Gifted&quot; kids are expected to forge ahead in topics that interest them but also to need a lot of unexpected help along the way. Unschooling works along that same premise but takes it a little further -not just &quot;gifted&quot; kids benefit from an individualized approach to exploring the world, but all kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: not anti-school","postDate":"1307971454","msgId":46866,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM4OEEzMzVCLTMwQTMtNDY5Qi1BQ0RELUI4RDBFODk3Q0NEMEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGl0NHVkMCtsNGw5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGl0NHVkMCtsNGw5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46865,"nextInTopic":46867,"prevInTime":46865,"nextInTime":46867,"topicId":46863,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Liking school doesn&#39;t mean every kid will like school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to understand better why people get so strongly behind unschooling,  <br/>\nit helps a great deal to dig into *why* people like school and *why*  <br/>\nsome people don&#39;t. What are the common factors? And how can that  <br/>\ninformation be expanded on to tailor learning for each child so  <br/>\neveryone can say they enjoyed learning?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He loves math and reading and science and history and doesn&#39;t feel  <br/>\n&gt; at all damaged by his school making him learn about them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s pretty much me too :-) I was a geeky kid. I loved  <br/>\nreading, science and math. I watched Shakespeare on TV for fun :-) I  <br/>\nwent on to college and got a degree in electrical engineering so I do  <br/>\nknow the fear that only school can get you the (supposedly) enormous  <br/>\namount math and science someone needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool can work well for kids who absorb information without trying.  <br/>\nIt can work well for kids who can pull an understanding just from  <br/>\nreading about something without needing to experience it. That&#39;s me.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s why I did well in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut not every child finds that way easy or interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people will say, well tough. They assume that school is the  <br/>\nreason that some kids get a lot from school. So it seems like forcing  <br/>\nyourself through school will get you what the kids who are good at  <br/>\nschool get.  But actually an enjoyment of the information and an ease  <br/>\nof learning that way is why some kids get a lot from school. Without  <br/>\nthe enjoyment, without the desire, school just can&#39;t be the same  <br/>\nexperience for every kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is like school but tailored to individual learning styles  <br/>\nand tastes :-) Unschooling is responding to each child individually to  <br/>\ncreate an environment where they can experience the &quot;enjoyment of the  <br/>\ninformation and an ease of learning&quot; so they too can learn easily  <br/>\n*and* well.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven for kids like me who were drawn to the types of things taught in  <br/>\nschool (like math, science and historical times for me), unschooling  <br/>\nusually won&#39;t look like school. It won&#39;t look like kids are learning  <br/>\nthe information that they (supposedly) need.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what they&#39;ll be doing instead of absorbing information is  <br/>\nabsorbing and building an *understanding* of how the world works.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been a long long process for me to unwrap my brain around the  <br/>\nidea that information leads to understanding. It&#39;s been hard because  <br/>\n*my* brain works that way. I absorb loads of ideas, let them simmer  <br/>\nand grow an understanding from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that isn&#39;t how humans -- all animals, really -- are wired to  <br/>\nlearn. We&#39;re wired to learn by trying things out and growing an  <br/>\nunderstanding of how the world works from what happens. That&#39;s why  <br/>\nkids play :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n From the outside that way of learning looks inefficient. From the  <br/>\noutside it looks like playing, goofing around, having fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n From the inside it doesn&#39;t look much different! :-) It feels like  <br/>\nplay :-) But in the background the brain is making connections and  <br/>\nexpanding on a picture of how the world works.<br/>\n<br/>\n(A small caveat: When someone wants a lot of information about a  <br/>\nsubject right now, a class or an all-you-need-to-know book is a good  <br/>\nway to do that. The reason that memorizing someone else&#39;s  <br/>\nunderstanding works in that instance is because someone already has a  <br/>\nbunch of questions they want answers to. They *want* the information.  <br/>\nBut without the questions, the information doesn&#39;t have anything to  <br/>\nattach to. So learn &quot;because you&#39;ll probably need it someday&quot; is as  <br/>\neffective as someone being made to read a book on &quot;How to make perfect  <br/>\naspic&quot;. For people like me who have a big internal drive to understand  <br/>\nhow the world works, even the book on aspic making might yield some  <br/>\ngems ;-) But most people aren&#39;t like me. And forced learning for  <br/>\npotential future needs is why most people hate school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout the need, without the desire, the information is often not  <br/>\ninherently interesting. (Except for people like me again! ;-) Being  <br/>\nforced to learn what&#39;s not interesting often leaves people turned off  <br/>\nto learning more about it. And worse, they may turn away from real  <br/>\nlife uses of it that would have helped them understand because it  <br/>\nbrings back bad memories of being forced. Which is why loads of kids  <br/>\nwill balk at doing arithmetic outside of class. :-/<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because we&#39;re hard wired to build our own understandings of how  <br/>\nthe world works, doesn&#39;t mean we need to build our understanding only  <br/>\nfrom scratch. Obviously people have been improving on an understanding  <br/>\nof how the world works since the beginning of thought! But how we  <br/>\nnaturally learn is by asking questions that intrigue us in whatever  <br/>\norder we encounter ideas that intrigue us. And we seek out answers to  <br/>\nthose questions. Some of the seeking of answers will be us trying  <br/>\nthings out for ourselves. (We&#39;re naturally driven to do this and find  <br/>\nit fun! :-) Some of it will be dipping into how others have explained  <br/>\nthe world. (Like asking mom or dad! ;-) Or reading a book.) When *we*  <br/>\nget curious about a particular question we will seek out whatever  <br/>\nmeans seems to match our need in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can be frustrating for someone who wants some feedback that  <br/>\nlearning is happening -- as schools must do to give to parents and the  <br/>\nstate -- is that the natural process isn&#39;t linear. It zigs and zags  <br/>\nand goes off on more interesting tangents. And the zig back may be  <br/>\nlater in the day or ten years from now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that zigging and zagging and those tangents don&#39;t look like  <br/>\nacademic learning for most kids. That&#39;s what can make unschooling  <br/>\nreally hard to accept for people like me! They look like playing. They  <br/>\nlook like playing hours and hours of video games. And asking  <br/>\nquestions. And drawing. And watching TV. And conversations. And  <br/>\nlistening to audio books. And playing with friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some kids the playing will look more educational like Legos and  <br/>\nscience experiments and completing 50,000 words of a novel in a month  <br/>\nfor National Novel Writing Month.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, here&#39;s the kicker: If the kids are exploring what interests them  <br/>\nin a rich environment -- where they encounter interesting things,  <br/>\nwhere their parents are interested in the world -- where their  <br/>\ninterests are taken seriously and supported, their understanding of  <br/>\nhow the world works will grow regardless of what they explore. By  <br/>\npursuing what interests them, they&#39;re making connections that are  <br/>\nimportant to who they are, important to how their brains work,  <br/>\nimportant to what about life fascinates them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor science minded folk, it&#39;s worrisome that not all kids absorb a  <br/>\ngreat understanding of science through unschooling. But not all kids  <br/>\nare interested in science. Not all kids are genetically wired to be  <br/>\nscientists. But *all* unschooled kids will build an understanding of  <br/>\nhow the world works (including the science aspects) and grow a desire  <br/>\nto know a bit more because they have the freedom to ask their *own*  <br/>\nquestions, to seek answers to what *they&#39;re* curious about.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids in school who aren&#39;t genetically wired to be scientists, who  <br/>\naren&#39;t curious in those directions, don&#39;t get that freedom to explore.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s assumed by educators and parents that they&#39;ll absorb the minimum  <br/>\nof &quot;what they need to know&quot;, but is that true? Are there long term  <br/>\nstudies? Schools only show kids have learned for the test. They  <br/>\nhaven&#39;t proven the kids have memorized for the long haul, and, more  <br/>\nimportantly, can&#39;t even demonstrate that the kids understand or can  <br/>\napply what they&#39;ve memorized in novel situations. What many kids who  <br/>\naren&#39;t drawn to learning by absorbing information certainly do come  <br/>\naway from school with is a dislike of science and a dislike or  <br/>\nlearning and a desire to stay far away from learning more. And that in  <br/>\nthe long term is far worse than not having memorized information but  <br/>\nnot having your curiosity crushed. Kids don&#39;t naturally hate math and  <br/>\nscience. But without a curiosity in what&#39;s being taught, being forced  <br/>\nto learn math and science (and literature and history) can make them  <br/>\nhate those subjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a couple of real life examples from my daughter:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was 10ish, we were reading a book that began with a joke:  <br/>\n&quot;The town clock frequently told the right time.&quot; (Love that line ;-)  <br/>\nShe asked what frequently meant. Now at 10 she&#39;d certainly heard that  <br/>\nword dozens and dozens of times. But it wasn&#39;t that she had *no*  <br/>\nunderstanding of the word. It&#39;s that she had been building an  <br/>\nunderstanding of the meaning of &quot;frequently&quot; bit by bit, refining it a  <br/>\nbit more each time she encountered the word in a new context. But her  <br/>\nunderstanding hadn&#39;t grown to the point where she was positive about  <br/>\nthe meaning of the joke. So she asked for a better understanding --  <br/>\nfor my understanding basically -- because the understanding she&#39;d  <br/>\npulled so far, the understanding she could pull from the joke, wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nenough for that moment. She *wanted* to get the joke so she tapped  <br/>\ninto my understanding,<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school the process would be to memorize the &quot;right&quot; answer:  <br/>\n&quot;occurring or done on many occasions, in many cases, or in quick  <br/>\nsuccession&quot;. And to work at understanding from there. But human brains  <br/>\nnaturally work the other way. They build up that understanding from  <br/>\nlots and lots of examples from loads of different contexts. Once  <br/>\nsomeone has loads of examples, a more generalized, abstract definition  <br/>\nwill make sense. School tries to hand kids the abstract before they&#39;ve  <br/>\nabsorbed an understanding from examples. And before they *want* the  <br/>\nabstract understanding. Before they *need* the abstract understanding  <br/>\nto answer questions they have.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal learning looks frustratingly inefficient! It *should* be possible  <br/>\nto just memorize understandings (like  &quot;occurring or done on many  <br/>\noccasions, in many cases, or in quick succession&quot;) and own that  <br/>\nunderstanding, and make that understanding work in real life. But  <br/>\nunfortunately it&#39;s not how (most) of us work. It works well for a few.  <br/>\nIt seems to work well for some (eg, they can spit it back for a test  <br/>\nand they *think* they understand). It works okay for others who have  <br/>\nto work to cram it in. It works poorly for others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the problem with memorizing other people&#39;s understanding,  <br/>\nmemorizing the abstract, is that it doesn&#39;t give us an understanding  <br/>\nof how and why something works in real life, and how and why it works  <br/>\nbetter than something else, and how and why it doesn&#39;t work as well as  <br/>\nthis other thing and when you&#39;d want to use this and when you&#39;d want  <br/>\nto use that. It doesn&#39;t give us the foundation of understanding that&#39;s  <br/>\nsummarized by someone else&#39;s understanding. It&#39;s *just* the summary.  <br/>\nSomeone else&#39;s understanding is like the label on the box. Building  <br/>\nour own understanding is the context of the box.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce someone has pulled an understanding of something from a variety  <br/>\nof real life encounters, it&#39;s easy to see how the (abstract) label  <br/>\napplies to the contents of the box. Its&#39; very very very difficult to  <br/>\nmemorize a label (an abstract way of looking at an idea) and then to  <br/>\nbuild an understanding to go inside that box.<br/>\n<br/>\nRelated to that, the woman professor who taught Physics I in college  <br/>\nsaid that boys picked up physics (mechanics) quicker than girls  <br/>\nbecause boys had spent their lives being the ball. And that&#39;s true!  <br/>\n(Obviously doesn&#39;t apply to all boys nor all girls, but it&#39;s true of  <br/>\nmany.) Boys (in general) knew how things acted in collision because  <br/>\nthey&#39;d *been* the ball, had hit balls, had thrown balls, had thrown  <br/>\nrocks and sticks, had experienced dozens of different kinds of  <br/>\n&quot;balls&quot;. So the abstract ideas presented in physics mapped to an  <br/>\nunderstanding they had absorbed from experience. Most of the girls,  <br/>\nthough, hadn&#39;t spent years experiencing the way different things act  <br/>\nin collision. So us girls had to try to imagine a picture of how the  <br/>\nworld works from a (mostly) abstract understanding of how we were told  <br/>\nthe world works. Which doesn&#39;t work anywhere near as well as real  <br/>\nexperience in a vast array of contexts!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat realization hit me hard when I went to write a paper about the  <br/>\nphysics of a punch as part of the test for a black belt in Tae Kwon  <br/>\nDo. I figured it would be easy. But as I delved into it, trying to  <br/>\napply the picture I&#39;d built to illustrate the abstract understanding  <br/>\nI&#39;d gotten from physics class, I realized I didn&#39;t understand at all.  <br/>\nThe picture I had had been good enough to answer questions on physics  <br/>\ntests. But when I tried to map it onto real life, my understanding  <br/>\nrevealed enormous cracks and holes. I thought I&#39;d understood. Tests  <br/>\nshowed I understood. But it wasn&#39;t an understanding at all. I had to  <br/>\nstart from scratch and build up an abstract  understanding from real  <br/>\nlife examples.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And the reason I did that, the reason it worked, is because I wanted  <br/>\nto understand. Being made to understand in college had obviously not  <br/>\nworked well at all! Even though I thought it had.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second daughter example: I too was doubtful that kids could learn  <br/>\nmath from living life. Sure, they&#39;d pick up some simple arithmetic  <br/>\nprobably. But all those hours and hours of studying and practicing  <br/>\nmath concepts from arithmetic to calculus was not going to happen by  <br/>\nliving real life, I was sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my daughter proved that idea wrong! By living life in a world  <br/>\nwhere she used numbers to tell her things she wanted to know about  <br/>\nthings that interested her, Kathryn absorbed an understanding of how  <br/>\nnumbers worked. And, more importantly, she absorbed and understanding  <br/>\nof how the world works *and* how numbers could represent that and why  <br/>\nsomeone would want to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how did she do that? Video games were her primary  <br/>\n&quot;curriculum&quot;. :-) Not educational video games! Pokemon. Super Mario  <br/>\nBrothers. Animal Crossing. The desire to solve the puzzles and beat  <br/>\nthe game made the information presented in numbers useful to her.  <br/>\nPokemon alone has hundreds of charts and graphs that can help someone  <br/>\nplay better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, she was interested in organizing collections so made  <br/>\ndatabases and spreadsheets. (Of Pokemon, of dinosaurs, of creatures  <br/>\nshe made up. What ever interested her. I helped her figure out how to  <br/>\ndo what *she* wanted.) She was also into drawing on computers which  <br/>\npresents a lot of information and ways to do things that are based on  <br/>\nnumbers. She had money to spend and wanted to know what she could buy  <br/>\nwith it and how much more she might new.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow she also did have a Dad who is interested in math but the amount  <br/>\nof fun stuff he showed her was minutes of math, not hours. (And he  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t torture her with the stuff she &quot;needed&quot; to know. He just showed  <br/>\nher fun stuff like Fibonacci numbers.) And I answered whatever  <br/>\nquestions she had, giving her the answers, walking through the answer  <br/>\nas I figured it out. (Eg, I never made her do the math.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that she didn&#39;t need an understanding of math to use  <br/>\nnumbers. She *pulled* an understanding of math from her desire to get  <br/>\nbetter at what she enjoyed -- especially video games :-) (And I want  <br/>\nto emphasize she&#39;s not a math geek. She wasn&#39;t doing math puzzles  <br/>\nunder the covers at night ;-) She&#39;s more of an artist and writer and  <br/>\nmusician. But she obviously does have the genes to want to understand  <br/>\nhow the world maps to numbers from both my husband and me.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unschooling, she *didn&#39;t* end up with a collection of knowledge  <br/>\nequivalent to 4 years of high school math. But she ended up with  <br/>\nsomething that was apparently much better. At 14 she took her father&#39;s  <br/>\ncollege statistics class and was always one of the highest scorers on  <br/>\nhomework and tests. While she voluntarily chose to sit through his  <br/>\nclasses twice, while she asked him questions while doing homework, all  <br/>\nthe work on the homework and on tests was hers. She was in class with  <br/>\ncollege students 3-5 years older than her who had been through 12+  <br/>\nyears of math classes and she did better than nearly all of them. Her  <br/>\npulled understanding was an asset. Their crammed in memorization was a  <br/>\nhandicap. (She also took Algebra and pre-Calculus. She made it through  <br/>\nmost of Calculus but the teacher was lousy and it became more of an  <br/>\nexercise to get the math so she didn&#39;t have to do it in college rather  <br/>\nthan for fun as it had been.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying every unschooled kid can take college statistics at 14!  <br/>\nShe did well because she&#39;d grown an understanding of how  the world  <br/>\nworks through pursuing her interests. She did well because she hadn&#39;t  <br/>\nbeen demoralized by 12 years of forced math. She did well because it  <br/>\ninterested her. It interested her because of genes (mostly) and  <br/>\nbecause of an environment where math was useful and fun and never  <br/>\nforced on her.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has learned well and profoundly about the world as long as she  <br/>\npursued what interested her. The learning dropped off when she was  <br/>\nlearning things that she didn&#39;t care to learn. The important thing is  <br/>\nthat very very little of what she did during her years unschooling  <br/>\nlooked like school. Most of it looked like things parents let their  <br/>\nkids do if the kids have been good, if the kids have finished their  <br/>\n(supposedly more important) school work. Since she&#39;s always been  <br/>\nresistant to learning what she hasn&#39;t chosen to learn, it&#39;s a good  <br/>\nguess that 12 years of required math would have handicapped her too.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: not anti-school","postDate":"1307966688","msgId":46864,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGl0NHVkMCtsNGw5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGl0M2hpNCtrcWJtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46863,"nextInTopic":46865,"prevInTime":46863,"nextInTime":46865,"topicId":46863,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is he sharing all that love of learning with his children?
