I had already packed hers, and I usually pack their bags (by their preference), but today there was a lot of extra work for the 5 animals that got spayed or neutered yesterday, plus some other unusual work. She let out a huge, &quot;put-upon&quot; sigh, and flopped down. I went over and explained that when she acts like that, even if she wants to help, it is hard for me to accept it.. It feels like I should come over and do it. She shocked me by saying that I do that a lot myself.  I don&#39;t think she would say this lightly.  I have no consciousness of it, but it must be so. Ugh! I thanked her for the revelation.  Though I felt sad about it, I am glad for the chance to watch myself. I am in a rather &#39;overwhelmed&#39; time.<br/>\nMy 13 yo said he doesn&#39;t mind helping out but he can&#39;t remotely tell what he should do. Even if there is a huge mess right in front of him, yes!  He has convinced me that he wants chore suggestions. So I leave him a list of suggested chores.  He can choose one, none two, tce. (I&#39;ve necer left more than 4). I always thanks him for any he does, and sometimes he follows me and visits with me as I do the rest. He seems to like this way right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nCameron<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27352,"nextTopicId":27367}}
