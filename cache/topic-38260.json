We live rural in  small (pop500) town.<br/>\nThere is a tiny city nearby (25 minutes) and a couple medium cities within 2<br/>\nhours. We can go to the city if there is something my kids desire there. We<br/>\nstay home and play A LOT. My kids are 1, 6 and 12. We have been living and<br/>\nlearning all their lives. I quit school and started de-schooling myself at<br/>\n15 or 16.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say play is not only our primary objective but we try to just have<br/>\nfun with whatever we are doing. We have a dog, cat, chickens and hermit<br/>\ncrabs. And live within walking distance of a nice trail for biking or<br/>\nwalking/running. There is a church in town that has a playground that the<br/>\nkids can use (we don&#39;t attend). We also have an amazing creek that we swim<br/>\nin all summer long.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday we played in the playroom, building marble runs and making a puppet<br/>\nshow. We read a few books. We walked in the rain and jumped on the<br/>\ntrampoline. We went to the store and found a huge canvas for dd12. We<br/>\nwatched part of a movie and ate some food. We met the school bus and played<br/>\nwith friends outside and now inside. They are presently all playing<br/>\nMarioKart on our wii. I believe the older crew walked to the playground.<br/>\nthey also have a fort. at some point a game of hide and seak ensued. plenty<br/>\nto do!<br/>\n<br/>\nI do feel isolated some times but to be perfectly honest I found it hard to<br/>\nfind other unschoolers when we lived in Baltimore (a big but not huge) city.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of my kids love museums, libraries and that kind of thing. Others<br/>\ndon&#39;t. So we do a huge variety of things. They all are very active so we<br/>\nfind ourselves out doors a lot moving around. Running, biking, hiking,<br/>\nplaying tag, jumping on the trampoline, chasing each other, playing wii,<br/>\ngoing on treasure hunts, making big art and all kinds of stuff.<br/>\nAlso our library is tiny but we can order whatever we want online and have<br/>\nit delivered from another library ready for pick up. It is awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think fun is what you make of it. All unschooling takes is paying<br/>\nattention to your child and yourself and searching out what you need. You<br/>\ncan find it anywhere. LOL&lt; I totally make it sounds easy. It takes work. I<br/>\nbelieve parenting is a career.

But then I start thinking back about all he <br/>\ndoes - parties and events and coffee houses and trips and just plain <br/>\nhanging out with friends - and I don&#39;t worry so much. There are ways <br/>\nto connect with others, even living in the middle of nowhere. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;not as much <br/>\n&gt; access to the great museums and libraries that we have here<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since your ds is only 3, you can&#39;t yet know if museums or libraries <br/>\nwill be useful resources or not. Some people love those, others not <br/>\nso much. My 15yo isn&#39;t much a fan of either. My 7yo enjoys museums <br/>\nand zoos, but doesn&#39;t have much patience for stopping and looking. So <br/>\nvisiting those places is more like a high speed chase than a &quot;trip to <br/>\na museum&quot;! It can be great fun... but bring your running shoes! <br/>\nAnyway, the upshot of that is we don&#39;t go very often - but when we do <br/>\nit tends to be a great event and lots of fun for the whole family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, what age did you start unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My 7yo has been unschooled from the start - I think I first saw the <br/>\nword &quot;unschooling&quot; when she was 2ish. My 15yo is my stepson. He&#39;s <br/>\nbeen unschooling for about 2.5 yrs now - before then he lived with <br/>\nhis mom and was in school, but when he was little he lived with us <br/>\nand homeschooled (long story).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At this age (3), would you <br/>\n&gt; have play be the primary objective of every day?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Play is how children learn. Ultimately, when people can learn without <br/>\nfeeling forced to do so, all learning is a kind of play - human <br/>\nbeings love to learn! My stepson has gone from a surly school kid who <br/>\nHated learning with a passion to a staunch advocate for the idea of <br/>\nlearning as a natural, joyful process.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow is a good time to step back (metaphorically speaking) and look at <br/>\nHow your child learns. You can learn a lot about him from watching <br/>\nthe way he plays right now. Is he methodical or does he leap into new <br/>\nthings? Does he laugh in the face of failure or get easily <br/>\nfrustrated? He&#39;s already expressing his basic temperament, which will <br/>\nhave a big impact on how he learns his whole life long. You have a <br/>\nwonderful opportunity to start supporting his learning process at an <br/>\nearly age! <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, its a wonderful thing to invite your little one to take <br/>\npart in any kind of family and household activities, too. Younger <br/>\nchildren often love to have the opportunity to help wash things, sort <br/>\nthings, pour and cut and stir things - all those things are play to a <br/>\nyoung child. There&#39;s no reason whatsoever not to look through <br/>\nvarious &quot;activities&quot; for young children with an eye to offering it as <br/>\nsomething fun to do. Just make sure its an offer, not a plan or a <br/>\nlesson. Kids are amazingly good at knowing their own primary <br/>\nobjectives ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling in a rural area and what age did you start?","postDate":"1234295747","msgId":38263,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4NTU1Mi4zMzc0Ni5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGdtc2hsZStnazl0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OENCNTlDRTRBM0JBNTdBLTlCMC0yQjZAV2VibWFpbC1tZzE0LnNpbS5hb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38262,"nextInTopic":38265,"prevInTime":38262,"nextInTime":38264,"topicId":38260,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s NOT about what you DON T have.
