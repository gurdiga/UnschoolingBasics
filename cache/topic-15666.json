He&#39;s been home with the kids and it&#39;s been pretty frustrating for him.  But today....he built a HUGE lego tower with the 7 and 6 yr old (the 3 yr old and 1 yr old were sleeping).  I took pics of it and I&#39;m going to put them on my blog.  I just thought it was cool that in the midst of his funk he took time to do something with the kids that they love so much. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay...it&#39;s time for cereal and an apple for dinner for my 3 yr old.

One <br/>\nof the books was a Winnie the Pooh book called, &quot;Oh Bother! <br/>\nSomeone&#39;s Messy&quot;.  As I read the book, I became more and more <br/>\nirritated.  I couldn&#39;t believe what I was reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Story: Kanga, Roo&#39;s mom, is frustrated that Roo&#39;s room is messy <br/>\nand that he doesn&#39;t care about it.  She decides that she has to do <br/>\nsomething about it.  She says to Roo that she doesn&#39;t care about his <br/>\nroom any more and he can make it as messy as he likes.  She is <br/>\nlying, of course, and is plotting to make Roo `want&#39; to clean his <br/>\nroom.  As you would expect, in the end Roo comes to see his <br/>\nmother&#39;s `wisdom&#39; and happily cleans his room.  The book&#39;s message <br/>\nto adults: it&#39;s ok to out and out lie to a child and to finagle a <br/>\nplan to get him to do what ever you want.  If a child experiences a <br/>\nmessy enough room, there will be a point where he _will_ care and <br/>\nclean the room to your expectations.  The book&#39;s message to <br/>\nchildren:  You are a bad person for being messy and not caring about <br/>\nthe condition of your room.  You should know better and are expected <br/>\nto want the same level of cleanliness and organization as an adult.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s ok to lie to a person to get what you want. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my mind, manipulating and lying to a person so that he does what <br/>\nyou want is called coercion.   If Kanga did this to another adult <br/>\nmost folks would think that she was a liar and a manipulative <br/>\nb**ch.  In this book however, she is a role model for good parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis made me so angry that I decided to write a hypothetical <br/>\nsituation involving my husband to demonstrate how unacceptable this <br/>\nbehavior would be with an adult and also to demonstrate how the <br/>\nsituation could be handled with more care and compassion.<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\nConsider this scenario:<br/>\nLet&#39;s say that I wanted my husband to go to the store and fix dinner <br/>\nfor the family one night when I was busy at work.  I ask him if he <br/>\nthinks that he can do this for me.  As an inexperienced cook he <br/>\nfeels a bit overwhelmed, but doesn&#39;t want to disappoint me, so he <br/>\nsays, yes. His heart is in the right place, but he really can&#39;t seem <br/>\nto get it all together, so dinner that night ends up being cereal <br/>\nfor the kids and some popcorn for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI decide that this is completely unacceptable and vow to get him to <br/>\ncook for the family the next time.  After all, I say, he should CARE <br/>\nabout what he and the children eat.  A day passes and I decide I <br/>\nwill stay at work late just to get him to do the cooking.  I lie and <br/>\ntell him that I can&#39;t come home.  I say to myself, this is for his <br/>\nown good.  If he gets hungry enough and the kids complain enough, <br/>\nhe&#39;ll learn to get groceries and learn to cook, by gosh.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat night, he prepares a modest dinner.  Wow, I think, he learned <br/>\nhis lesson. How clever am I?  Later however, he learns that I lied <br/>\nabout staying at work late.  His lesson: Don&#39;t trust my wife.  My <br/>\nlesson: Learn to lie and not get caught?  MmmOr, is my lesson, <br/>\ndon&#39;t lie to begin with?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this situation, do you think he&#39;ll ever willingly and lovingly <br/>\ncook another dinner for the family?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s another scenario<br/>\nAfter asking my husband to cook, he says, yes.  He feels a little <br/>\ntimid because of his inexperience as a cook, but doesn&#39;t want to <br/>\ndisappoint me.  He isn&#39;t quite sure what recipe to cook, what <br/>\ningredients to get and is a bit stressed about where to find the <br/>\nstuff in the store.   Realizing that a cook isn&#39;t made overnight, I <br/>\nprovide him with a recipe, grocery list and pointers on where to <br/>\nlocate the food at the store.<br/>\n <br/>\nLater that night, I find he has made spaghetti and has left-overs <br/>\nwaiting for me.   It&#39;s not exactly the recipe I had suggested, but <br/>\nhe was very thoughtful in saving some for me.   Things are not done <br/>\nexactly as I would have them, but the kids are happy and I give him <br/>\na big thanks and a hug.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s one last scenario<br/>\nAfter asking my husband to cook, he says, no.  He knows that he is <br/>\nso inexperienced that he simply is not ready to take on this task on <br/>\nhis own and is afraid of disappointing me.  He can&#39;t admit that in <br/>\nwords, but I know that with some things the learning curve is just <br/>\ntoo steep.  Instead of putting him in an even tougher situation and <br/>\ninsisting that he stick it out or lying to get him to do it, I <br/>\ndecide to make some practical suggestions.  I suggest that he order <br/>\nsome take-out or pick up a frozen pizza from the store.  Or, I ask, <br/>\nif he can get the groceries and wait a bit for dinner, than I will <br/>\ndo the cooking when I get home.  These are just a few possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh Bother! Someone&#39;s Messy&quot;  Yuck, how belittling.  I could <br/>\nparallel, &quot;Oh Bother! Someone&#39;s a Bad Cook.&quot;  Does that help my <br/>\nhusband become a better cook?  Does it help me get a dinner on the <br/>\ntable?  Does it send the message that my husband is a valued and <br/>\nloved member of the family?  Does it do anything for my relationship <br/>\nwith my husband? No, no, no and no.<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes me really really angry is that I was that mom a couple <br/>\nyears ago, following conventional wisdom, forcing my children to <br/>\nclean their rooms in coercive ways and thinking, &quot;it&#39;s for their own <br/>\ngood.&quot;  Thanks to all the folks on the unschooling lists, I have <br/>\nlearned that there are better ways to help children learn.  Shaming, <br/>\nlying and coercing are not it, whatever books and the mainstream <br/>\nseem to think.  With my eyes wide open, I am a little melancholy <br/>\nknowing that the vast majority of children are treated this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why sometimes I just gotta&#39; find a place where no one can <br/>\nhear me scream, &quot;I LOVE UNSCHOOLING!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dana</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15645,"nextTopicId":15672}}
