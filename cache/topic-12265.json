We live in a very rural area of<br/>\nHarpers Ferry, in a cabin midway down a mountain that has the Shenandoah<br/>\nsnaking around its base.  We have one human neighbor on our gravel road and<br/>\nmore animal neighbors than we can count.  They help themselves to our garden<br/>\nand provide the boys with hours of entertainment daily.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband works in NOVA, about a 1-1.5 hours away and I stay home with the<br/>\nboys.  We&#39;re a single car family, so we&#39;re a bit isolated, and not hurting<br/>\nfor it, I think.  We&#39;re never wanting for things to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went from unschooling to relaxed homeschooling (wherein I convinced<br/>\nmyself that I was following their lead, but really, I was influencing their<br/>\ndecisions in subtle and not-so-subtle ways) and I would like to get back to<br/>\nunschooling.  I see tension creeping into our days and I see myself getting<br/>\nin the way of the boys&#39; natural love of learning, which is something I never<br/>\nwant to happen.  All of the boys taught themselves to nurse, to crawl, to<br/>\nwalk, to talk, to sleep through the night, to use the potty, and more than I<br/>\ncan list, all when they were ready.  Jonathan Peter taught himself to read<br/>\nbefore his third birthday, Benjamen David was climbing impossible structures<br/>\nwhen he was a toddler, and Nicholas Jacob was walking at 7 months old.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know why I thought I could improve on that, but I know my own<br/>\ninsecurities and fears were motivating me.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday we&#39;re deschooling, raking leaves outside, playing in the yard, having<br/>\na picnic lunch, blowing bubbles, and taking a walk later on to see what&#39;s<br/>\nblooming on the mountain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to getting to know you all and I&#39;ve already been inspired and<br/>\nrejuvenated by your posts.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJenniffer in Harpers Ferry<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://octopigarden.blogspot.com/\">http://octopigarden.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nListen, are you breathing just a little, and calling it a life? ~Mary Oliver<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12258,"nextTopicId":12284}}
