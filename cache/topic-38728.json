I am now *almost* comfortable with my body.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he&#39;s the question...we are moving back to Fl and are buying a<br/>\nhouse with a pool and I&#39;d like to swim naked, sunbathe etc.  My boys<br/>\nare 12 and 10.  Would it be completely wrong to start this now?  Am I<br/>\ngoing to scar their psyches?<br/>\n<br/>\n**I&#39;m NOT saying I&#39;m going to do this.  I&#39;d like to know what this<br/>\ngroup of free thinkers thinks about this as a possible new thing.**<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38714,"nextTopicId":38727}}
