It is now about five months into the <br/>\ndeschooling process and while I certainly see some moves away from <br/>\nscreen time, I find myself in some turmoil over their lack of <br/>\ninterest in reading and writing.<br/>\n*********************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help you to keep in mind that kids (people in general) go <br/>\nthrough cycles of interest and growth. I&#39;ve seen that with <br/>\nmy &quot;always&quot; unschooled 6yo - for months she was alllllll about <br/>\ndrawing, but then her interest waned and for awhile, while she was <br/>\ndoing things all the time, she didn&#39;t really have a major passion <br/>\ngoing on. Then all of a sudden she was all about cutting things out <br/>\nof paper - it was as though the &quot;drawing&quot; part of her was &quot;under <br/>\nconstruction&quot; and now its something more elaborate. <br/>\n<br/>\nOther things, like reading or singing, she has cycles of interest <br/>\nand disinterest. She doesn&#39;t seem to be growing in those areas <br/>\nduring the times of disinterest, she just finds other things more <br/>\nfascinating for a time.<br/>\n<br/>\n******************<br/>\n  I do look hard to see that they are reading it just isn&#39;t <br/>\nconsistent and they rarely take themselves through a novel...which <br/>\nthey used to love to do...They are both amazing writers but this <br/>\nisn&#39;t part of their daily lives at all. <br/>\n*******************<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Consistent&quot; is an expectation that school fosters. Kids are <br/>\nexpected to read every day, write every day, do math problems every <br/>\nday. That doesn&#39;t really reflect the way people persue interests in <br/>\nreal life. While its true that some people are avid readers life-<br/>\nlong, most &quot;readers&quot; go through phases - get all wrapped up in one <br/>\nauthor, for example, and then move on to another. Or one genre. Same <br/>\nthing with movies - ever had the urge to see absolutely everything <br/>\nthat Robin Williams ever performed in (for example, maybe you prefer <br/>\nWoody Allen)? <br/>\n<br/>\nWriting is similar - some people do write every day, but they don&#39;t <br/>\nnecessarily write the same things every day. One of my favorite <br/>\nauthors (Mercedes Lackey) says she likes to have a whole bunch of <br/>\nprojects going at once so that when she&#39;s not feeling creative in <br/>\none she can put it down and pick up another.<br/>\n<br/>\n***screen time***<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to pull this phrase out and ask you to analyze it a bit <br/>\nmore. If your kids previously read a lot of novels, in particular, <br/>\nare they watching shows and movies and playing games that have novel-<br/>\nlike qualities? That was something I found *myself* doing when we <br/>\nfirst got Netflix, and then again when I discovered fantasy role-<br/>\nplaying computer games (there aren&#39;t nearly enough of these!) I had <br/>\nbeen &quot;trained&quot; to think that movies and shows and games were somehow <br/>\nless than reading, but when I was able to step away from that I <br/>\ncould see how I was choosing to watch and play the same sorts of <br/>\nthings I would choose to read. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, boy, now I&#39;m thinking about the relationship between Charles <br/>\nDickens and series television as its now being produced.... too much <br/>\ncoffee.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 14)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210117180,"authorName":"Jessica","from":"Jessica &lt;patchworkgirl@...&gt;","profile":"patchworkgirl57","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Mathematics for a schooled girl","postDate":"1192897452","msgId":27233,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDcxMDIwMTEyNDEyLjdjZjE5NGQ1LnBhdGNod29ya2dpcmxAd2VhdmluZ3JhaW5ib3cuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExOTI4ODUyMDQuODEyLjMyMDEubTQ1QHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDExOTI4ODUyMDQuODEyLjMyMDEubTQ1QHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":27232,"nextInTopic":27236,"prevInTime":27232,"nextInTime":27234,"topicId":27217,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Another good one (and you have these where ever you go) is your hands which are great for the 9 times table... put the first (left) pinky down, everything to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-844171262\">Another good one (and you have these where ever you go) is your hands which are great for the 9 times table... put the first (left) pinky down, everything to the right of it is the answer to 1x9.. 2nd finger down gives you 1 finger on the left and 8 on the right to make 2x9=18... 9x6, put your right thumb away & you&#39;ll see five fingers on the left hand & 4 to the right to make 54 & so on...

It defeats the whole idea about learning.  I have taught for 20 years and I have never assigned homework.  It was always available on the way out the door if kids wanted to do more of what they did in school but it was never mandated.  Home time is too precious and really shouldn&#39;t be spent in a battle about school.  There are no real studies that homework improves academics until perhaps high school.  This is one of the many reasons I took my kids out of school and while I struggle with the whole idea still, our family life is less stressful, my kids are calm, happy and there are no battles to fight around homework.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  On another note, I still feel a little anxious about what both Kora and Lukas stay away from.

What could we do ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also thought of a few ways to play with multiplication facts, so <br/>\n&gt; that they could learn them without sitting at a table, with my <br/>\n&gt; friend &quot;quizzing&quot; her daughter.

(and she&#39;s the sweetest person I know, but this is <br/>\nanother question :))<br/>\n<br/>\nShe told me recently that she gave money to her 9 yo daughter when <br/>\nthe girl was doing her homework without &quot;fighting&quot;. I was a bit <br/>\nsurprised and told her that I wouldn&#39;t do that, that it doesn&#39;t seem <br/>\nlike a good idea to me. Anyway. After this talk, I started <br/>\nbrainstorming : what could she do to solve this homework problem <br/>\n(except from unschooling, which is not possible yet as she is the <br/>\nbreadwinner and her husband would certainly not hear about it !)<br/>\nWITHOUT forcing her daughter in a way or another. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the ideas I had :<br/>\n<br/>\n- have a real (I mean friendly) discussion with her daughter to <br/>\nunderstand why she doesn&#39;t want to do her homework : is it because <br/>\nshe finds the task tedious, is it because she&#39;d rather rest a bit <br/>\nafter a school day, is it because she&#39;d rather do something else with <br/>\nher mother, etc. <br/>\n- find ways to make her homework more playful (my friend told me <br/>\nabout multiplication facts and verbs tenses) and more meaningful too. <br/>\n- imply her daughter in the process : ok, your teacher wants you to <br/>\nlearn these things and it&#39;s really not interesting. What could we do ?<br/>\n<br/>\nI also thought of a few ways to play with multiplication facts, so <br/>\nthat they could learn them without sitting at a table, with my <br/>\nfriend &quot;quizzing&quot; her daughter. Someone said once that you should <br/>\nnever quizz a kid about something s/he doesn&#39;t know. If she knows, <br/>\nit&#39;s fun, you can do it together, try to be quick, and so on, but if <br/>\nshe does not, she will feel miserable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that here is a list where we talk about unschooling and not <br/>\nabout &quot;pleasant schooling&quot;, but my idea is to help my friend to see <br/>\nthings differently and find other solutions, solutions in which her <br/>\ndaughter would be really taken seriously. I&#39;m not trying <br/>\nto &quot;convince&quot; her into unschooling, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible. I <br/>\njust want to slightly  move her viewpoint, so that she won&#39;t tell me <br/>\nanymore (and won&#39;t think it, either) &quot;but what else can I do ? I&#39;m <br/>\ntired of fighting with her&quot;. She is very interested in my unschooling <br/>\nprocess, and the discussions we have are really open. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t read English either, because if she did, I would have <br/>\ngiven her a few useful links ;p<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is any suggestion ... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks<br/>\nHelen in Geneva, Switzerland</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27149,"nextTopicId":27245}}
