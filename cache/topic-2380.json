She&#39;s  almost 4<br/>\nnow and most nights we have a routine of bath, pj&#39;s brush teeth then get in<br/>\nbed with a favorite book (chapter books work better for her than pic books -<br/>\nnot as stimulating)  TV and back rubs never worked for her.  Even nursing in<br/>\nbed doesn&#39;t always do the trick.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found for her that finding some way to convince her to lie down and<br/>\nkeep her head on the pillow is the main thing.  A gentle hand on her back or<br/>\nhead sometimes comforts her and my rhythmic slow &quot;stage breathing&quot; I mean<br/>\nbreathing loudly enough for her to hear.  Also, the light level needs to be<br/>\nto her liking: not too light, not too dark, and the temperature of the room<br/>\na bit on the cool side.  Anyway, you&#39;ll find different preferences for your<br/>\ndd but if you know she&#39;s tired and she&#39;s going to get to sleep in minutes,<br/>\nit sounds like your probably already doing some of this.  I&#39;d try to stay<br/>\nwith her rather than leave her alone to fuss maybe stroking her hair or with<br/>\nyour hand on her back?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 10<br/>\n   Date: Thu, 29 Jul 2004 15:45:03 -0400<br/>\n   From: &quot;Lanie Carlson-Lim&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pyxiewytch@...\">pyxiewytch@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: bedtime rituals<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if this an &quot;unschooling&quot; question per se as it applies to my<br/>\ntoddler.
