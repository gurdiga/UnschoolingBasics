The very first thing said in the program was: &quot;Every year millions of children are subjected to the ultimate experiment: we send them to school.&quot; Maybe if you think about the fact that school itself is an experiment, it will help to calm the fears you may have about the unschooling experiment you are about to take your daughter down. <br/>\n<br/>\nChoosing how to take a child from infancy to adulthood is a scary thing when you decide to opt out of the mainstream choice. It feels like you are gambling. But everybody is gambling, some just aren&#39;t examining their choices as much as others. I would recommend keeping a diary, a blog, a scrapbook anything filled with the engaging moments that make up your days and that help you to see how it is working. And when you feel fear or nervousness growing about this grand experiment you are on, flip through the pages of this journal and really see how your life with your daughter is being woven into a rich and glorious tapestry. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: jennifercroce37 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jennifercroce37@...\">jennifercroce37@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, I am new to this group and am considering unschooling my daughter next year, she will be in 2nd grade.
