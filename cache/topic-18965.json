He left school due to possible allergic reaction to chemicals or mold and I could immediately see that independent study or traditional homeschooling was not very attractive.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy reading here and educating myself I had the courage to allow him to take the proficience test this past October and he passed!  It&#39;s such a relief to not be tied down to public school.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe spends most of his days sleeping late, on the computer and doing his music.  He plays drums and has been teaching himself guitar, bass, things he may not otherwise have had time for.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been nice to have the extra time with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaret</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":228583797,"authorName":"thisismaggiesemailaddress","from":"&quot;thisismaggiesemailaddress&quot; &lt;thisismaggiesemailaddress@...&gt;","profile":"thisismaggiesemailaddress","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Thank you!","postDate":"1163699002","msgId":18965,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVqaTd2cStpdmhiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":45341,"prevInTime":18964,"nextInTime":18966,"topicId":18965,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I want to take a minute to thank everyone who took the time to read and reply to my post and apologies for it taking so long as I ve had some computer","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-540018938\">Hi, <br/>\nI want to take a minute to thank everyone who took the time to read and <br/>\nreply to my post and apologies for it taking so long as I&#39;ve had some <br/>\ncomputer problems making it difficult to get online. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was the one who wrote about the evening visit from the police and the <br/>\nletters, phone calls etc from someone telling me my dh was cheating.
