OTOH, I do make <br/>\nreally solid agreements with my teen, in particular. Its rare that he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t follow through *because* he has the assurance, when he&#39;s <br/>\nmaking the agreement, that &quot;I don&#39;t think I can do that&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not <br/>\nvery good at that sort of thing&quot; or just &quot;Sorry, not interested&quot; are <br/>\nall accepable answers. That&#39;s a relationship that has built over <br/>\ntime, though. I wouldn&#39;t have expected it of him when he&#39;d only been <br/>\nout of school a year.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One of my questions is about urgency and priority.

Its not his priority and you Can&#39;t Make it his priority. <br/>\nHave you dealt with adults who are like this in the workplace? You <br/>\nend up banging your head against the wall because they&#39;ll cheat and <br/>\nsneak and otherwise mess up when faced with a priority they don&#39;t <br/>\naccept. Kids will do the same thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo how do unschoolers manage to &quot;be on the same page&quot; in terms of <br/>\npriorities with our kids? Its a matter of building an atmosphere of <br/>\nmutual support over time - starting with the parents doing virtually <br/>\nall the supporting. When we bust Our butts to honor their priorities <br/>\nwe are modeling holding to agreements in a way that kids understand <br/>\non a direct, personal level. Supporting others&#39; needs then becomes <br/>\nsomething they value directly, and aspire to doing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; aware that there&#39;s a part of me that wants to &#39;teach&#39; him, but I<br/>\n&gt; wonder if part of modeling is being firm about holding to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>agreements.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of modeling more in terms of imitation. If you are &quot;holding <br/>\nfirm&quot; then That&#39;s what you are modeling. When our kids reflect that <br/>\nbehavior directly back at us its called &quot;being stubborn&quot;. Rememeber <br/>\nback to the first time you heard your son cuss or mimic some other <br/>\nless-than-lovely habit of yours? Same sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately now you&#39;re faced with a really crazy situation - You <br/>\nagreed that &quot;he&#39;d be responsible at some level&quot; without clarifying <br/>\nthat properly. Naturally, its not working so well for you, so you&#39;re <br/>\ntrying to Back Out of the Agreement. Oops.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying you&#39;re stuck with what you have, but going in as The <br/>\nBank of Dad and saying &quot;you must now come up with x amount of money <br/>\nby y date&quot; isn&#39;t going to model anything but how to be an a$$. <br/>\nInstead, you have the opportunity to model being the better man, <br/>\nswallowing your pride and saying: &quot;Okay, I f&#39;ed this up. Its all my <br/>\nfault for not actually telling you what I really wanted. I&#39;m sorry. <br/>\nCan we renegotiate?&quot; That&#39;s an important skill for anyone to learn at <br/>\nany age. People even do that with banks and other creditors - and if <br/>\nyou go in early enough, they&#39;ll often work to renegotiate the loan. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind, when you go to renegotiate, that he probably does want <br/>\nto help you out on some level. Do as much as you can to help him help <br/>\nyou. Think of it in terms of the &quot;mutual&quot; part of mutual support - <br/>\nhow can y&#39;all work together to find a solution that you&#39;re both more <br/>\ncomfortable with? It doesn&#39;t have to be perfect.

The child promises up and down they&#39;ll take care  <br/>\nof it without realizing what that reality feels like. They&#39;re making  <br/>\na promise to do something they don&#39;t fully grasp and most of them  <br/>\ncan&#39;t keep.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo, if he didn&#39;t have a reliable source of income, it wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nreasonable to enter into the bargain to begin with. Agreeing to pay  <br/>\nfor vague future unexpected maintenance I&#39;m sure sounded fair to him,  <br/>\nbut he didn&#39;t have a good grasp of how much that could be or have a  <br/>\nworkable plan in place on how to get the money.<br/>\n<br/>\nThree, now that he already has an operating car, there&#39;s little  <br/>\nincentive to work for the money. *This is just human nature.* And  <br/>\nit&#39;s the incentive pickle people find themselves in with credit  <br/>\ncards. It&#39;s much easier to motivate yourself to work to buy something  <br/>\nyou want than to work to pay off a debt. With cash in hand and faced  <br/>\nwith paying money owed on something owned that&#39;s losing it&#39;s new  <br/>\nluster and something new and desired, it&#39;s really really hard to pay  <br/>\noff the debt: basically hand over the money and receive nothing in  <br/>\nreturn. That&#39;s why most people should have debit cards instead of  <br/>\ncredit! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I&#39;d chalk it up as a learning experience. The bargain  <br/>\nsounded good but it didn&#39;t have a good foundation. Talk to him about  <br/>\nthat and recognize that it wasn&#39;t reasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou shouldn&#39;t enter into a new agreement that he pay for repairs  <br/>\nunless he has a job.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if he does have an income (you said he&#39;s paying the monthly  <br/>\npayment) then don&#39;t be vague about what percentages or what set  <br/>\namount he needs to pay! Work it out up front. (Now that he knows what  <br/>\na repair bill looks like, you have some concrete numbers to work  <br/>\nwith. He&#39;ll know what 10% can feel like.) You wouldn&#39;t get a car loan  <br/>\nand agree you&#39;d pay &quot;something&quot; that they&#39;d disclose after the  <br/>\nfact! ;-) You&#39;d need to know before hand whether the payment would  <br/>\nfit into your finances.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s going to use the car for school, and you want him to get to  <br/>\nschool and not have to work, then you&#39;d be meeting your own goal by  <br/>\ntaking on paying for repairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288066488,"authorName":"osani","from":"&quot;osani&quot; &lt;e@...&gt;","profile":"osani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Teaching son about money? ugh.","postDate":"1232745828","msgId":38099,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdsZGNoNCs4MTY5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdsYWljbyt1aGdoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38088,"nextInTopic":38102,"prevInTime":38098,"nextInTime":38100,"topicId":38051,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My attitude <br/>\nwhen my daughter was deschooling was I was giving her a gift of time <br/>\nto get to know herself.  When she left school at 13 and spent a good <br/>\n9 months doing a lot of sleeping and then another year fliting from <br/>\nthis to that it was hard to see sometimes the value in it.  I felt <br/>\nvery strongly though that in the long run the discoveries she made <br/>\nabout herself and figuring out what she thought and felt and <br/>\nbelieved would serve her well.  Especially for older unschoolers I <br/>\nthink having that time to just be is really important. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been two years now since Lizzy left school and one of the <br/>\nthings I like the most about her is I know whatever she does, even <br/>\nif I don&#39;t agree with it, she is doing it because she wants to.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s not one to be influenced by peer pressure.  She WILL do what <br/>\nshe wants and WILL NOT do what she doesn&#39;t.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout money in particular though.  Lizzy has worked for money since <br/>\nshe was 12 and currently brings home about $100 a week and gets paid <br/>\nevery 4-6 weeks so she&#39;s dealing with big chunks of money.  I am not <br/>\ngreat with money and big surprise neither is she.  She has figured <br/>\nout that if she would rather spend all her money at once on <br/>\nsomething big than spend it here and there and feel like she has <br/>\nnothing.  I wish I could help her be better with money but am <br/>\nrealistic that I haven&#39;t given her the best role model her whole <br/>\nlife.  I focus more on doing better with our family money than <br/>\ngiving her a hard time about how she spend her money.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI suprised her the other day.  She wants to take a photography class <br/>\nso she wanted a good camera.  I took her to Walmart and she went <br/>\nstraight to the camera she wanted and I said ok looks good.

I, too, have younger children and my fears are that they will feel entitled and act like many of the kids in the area around us.  We live in a part of Ohio where the average income is triple digits (not us, others) and most of my friends send their kids to $10,000/child private schools.  I see these kids getting everything they want, so I want to make sure I don&#39;t act like their parents.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat you said - &quot;Mindful parenting takes alot more effort in the moment, but is so worth it when we put the relationship first and we and our kids can share a deep trust.  I really want my kids to know 100% that it&#39;s really important to me to help them get what they want!&quot;  makes a lot of sense to me after reading that and I am trying to listen and learn here.  Being an effective parent is not the same as being an efficient parent.  Thanks for bringing these thoughts to my attention.  I&#39;m still learning!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.comFrom\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.comFrom</a>: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jodibezzola@...\">jodibezzola@...</a>: Thu, 22 Jan 2009 21:40:32 -0800Subject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] Teaching son about money? ugh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~I guess on this one I might be the odd-ball out, but this is my perspective.  If I had already paid for it to be fixed than I would consider that a &quot;freebie&quot; and would tell him the next time it breaks down he will have to pay for it or it won&#39;t get fixed and then I would let him continue to hang with his friends.  If you paid for the car to be fixed and then tell him after the fact that he has to pay it back, I would consider that unfair (not that life is always fair).~~ I have to comment on this.  I don&#39;t have kids old enough yet to own cars, but they have stuff that has gotten broken, that&#39;s for sure.  I consider it my job to partner with them and discover *together* how to repair/replace it.  Telling them they have one strike that you&#39;ll pay for and then they&#39;re out and on their own isn&#39;t respectful in my opinion.  And it&#39;s taking the easy way out isn&#39;t it??  Mindful parenting takes alot more effort in the moment, but is so worth it when we put the relationship first and we and our kids can share a deep trust.  I really want my kids to know 100% that it&#39;s really important to me to help them get what they want!~~If it were me and I wanted my son to learn the value of having things and fixing them, etc etc, I would not have fixed it in the first place and would have let him figure out how to get places (bus, ride with friends, get a job to pay for it). But in fairness, if I felt it was more important that he have the car to get where ever it is he needs to get to than I would use this as an opportunity to explain how financially you will get involved the next time it happens and hold yourself to it if it breaks down.  That is real-life learning.  Of course, you should be a guide for him and explain some things and stick to them, but believe me he will learn.~~ How do you think your husband would feel if you decided to take this approach?  Mine would be resentful as hell.  It really helps me when I&#39;m wondering how to approach a situation/discussion/whatever with my child, to imagine how I or another adult would feel, and proceed accordingly.  Real-life learning isn&#39;t punishment.  Real-life learning is what happens *inspite* of you doing the best you can to partner and assist and guide and inform and trust.  I really cringe at the whole notion of &#39;be firm and they will learn&#39;.  It really is old school to believe that hard knocks promote learning.  Yuck.

Having fun and hanging out with friends can still occur even if he needs to get a part-time job.  At least he can save a few dollars a week in case of an emergency or another breakdown and should still have plenty of time to have fun and be a kid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.comFrom\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.comFrom</a>: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aenclade@...\">aenclade@...</a>: Thu, 22 Jan 2009 19:45:28 +0000Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Teaching son about money? ugh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp!
