If Simon and Linnaea are having a harder time dealing with one another unto the point of anger, I up the amount of time that I am with them. I try and make sure that all their other needs are taken care of, they aren&#39;t hungry or thirsty or tired. I do that not by making them eat or sleep or drink, but by making eating and sleeping and drinking easy, by putting food and drink that they like in easy reach and helping them to find a nice movie to watch, or to lie down with me and listen to a story, if they want to, or something else calming that will help them to rest and relax. All of those things together seem to get rid of much of the tension that occurs in our house. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:susdys@...\">susdys@...</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:susdys@...\">susdys@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, 15 November, 2007 4:12:26 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Not gentle parents<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 11/13/2007 5:26:24 P.M.

Guilt doesn&#39;t help you or the situation.  Give yourself a break and know that you have always done the best you could with the cards you were dealt and the knowledge and tools you possessed at the time.  As for children being formed in early childhood - poppycock.  Everyone can change at any point in their lives. Practical advice - make a book of positive aspects about you husband and each of your children.  List everything you appreciate about them.  Look for evidence of them being kind and or gentle with one another (I know at first you will have a hard time noticing them, but look carefully). If you pay more attention to the good things about your family, and increasingly less attention to what is wrong with them, you will soon find more to love about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd by the way - most children bicker, fight, and hit each other ocassionally, and most mothers find themselves wracked with guilt at some point in their lives - you are so not alone :) <br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nLisa<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Not gentle parents","postDate":"1195039493","msgId":27734,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJDQTBEMzEzLTg3MDMtNEIzRi04MTRFLUVDNUUwNTU4MEM2NkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZoY3A4NisxMGhqZkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGZoY3A4NisxMGhqZkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":27731,"nextInTopic":27749,"prevInTime":27733,"nextInTime":27735,"topicId":27725,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Kids fight, bicker and hit.  Even kids<br/>\nwho come from the most absolute of Zen parents do it.<br/>\nI&#39;ve laid the same guilt trip on myself, too, when they are icky to each<br/>\nother.  &quot;Oh, it must be because I&#39;m so _______ (fill in the blank with<br/>\nself-condemning word of choice).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not.  What you *can* do, is LOOOOOVE the pieces out of them, even when<br/>\nthey&#39;re being mean to each other.  Hold them, both, if there&#39;s a victim and<br/>\nan aggressor, silently.  Just hold them in your arms.  No lecture, no<br/>\ndissappointment, no wishing things were something they&#39;re not at that<br/>\nmoment.  Just love them with your whole heart, especially when you feel like<br/>\nyou&#39;d rather string them up by their toes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;ll be ok.<br/>\nLove *is* all you need...<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thewildtribe.blogspot.com\">http://www.thewildtribe.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n&quot;When the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know<br/>\npeace.&quot;<br/>\nJimi Hendrix<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":198023026,"authorName":"caradove","from":"&quot;caradove&quot; &lt;caradove@...&gt;","profile":"caradove","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Not gentle parents","postDate":"1194977350","msgId":27725,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZoY3A4NisxMGhqZkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":27728,"prevInTime":27724,"nextInTime":27726,"topicId":27725,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I need a bit of insight and support.

But what riddles me with<br/>\nguilt and frustration is that nearly all the interactions are<br/>\naggressive, loud,argumentative. <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel a complete absence of kindness, gentleness, even love. I have<br/>\ntried to do the right things. Natural births, long term nursing co<br/>\nsleeping, no school,etc. Went through a psychologically abusive<br/>\nrelationship when my first son was a baby and pregnant with second. <br/>\nEarly in current relationship Dh went through nervous breakdown,<br/>\ndepression and a short hospital stay from childhood issues, home and<br/>\nboarding school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like gentle parenting does not come naturally. And getting<br/>\nangry with DH all these years for his anger issues, even though he has<br/>\nworked at it and is definitely miles better, doesn&#39;t help anything. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am frustrated now that the children bicker, fight and sometimes hit<br/>\neach other.But I honestly don&#39;t know what to say anymore. I feel like<br/>\nwe caused it, and can&#39;t turn back time. I am in tears here,this is<br/>\nsuch a burden of guilt. That I have screwed up the children&#39;s ability<br/>\nto be kind and thoughtful with each other by not having that in our <br/>\nown married relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n We have been through some extremely stressful situations, including<br/>\nmy father in law evicting us from the home my husband built and moving<br/>\ninto a house that should probably have been condemned. We have worked<br/>\nfor six years to improve it, basics like no insulation, termites,<br/>\nserious water damage, and have twice had 7ft floodwater in the<br/>\nbasement.Dh works full time but we get food stamps and money is too<br/>\ntight for five kids and us.      <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone else struggle with guilt? What about the idea that your<br/>\nchildren are well formed by what they experience early in life?<br/>\nWhat can I do to turn around the children&#39;s fighting and hurting each<br/>\nother?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if I am rambling, any support is welcome<br/>\n<br/>\nCara, mom to Ebhann 11, Isa 9, Krsangi 6, Dharani 4, Nila 17mnth.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27739,"nextTopicId":27770}}
