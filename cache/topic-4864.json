I thought I had <br/>\nbroken some ground last year when my middle child said something <br/>\nabout unschooling and my mom didn&#39;t freak out, but I found out that <br/>\nwasn&#39;t the case.  Of course my mom is not happy with me because I <br/>\nquit my job at her church and started my own business (Pampered <br/>\nChef).  As much as I would love for them to support me and (mostly) <br/>\nmy children in their growing without schooling, I know I probably <br/>\nwon&#39;t.  My parents have totally bought into the &quot;school is best <br/>\nschool is the norm children *need* school&quot; line.  &lt;sigh&gt;  So what I <br/>\nhave come to realize is that *I* am raising *MY* children.  *they* <br/>\nhave no say in what I feed them, how I let them dress, and how they <br/>\nlearn all the things that they want to learn.  I&#39;m doing nothing <br/>\nillegal or detrimental to my children so there are no grounds for me <br/>\nto worry that they would try to take them from me.  (Besides, my <br/>\nmother has said on more than one occaission that she doesn&#39;t know <br/>\nwhy in the world I had THREE children let alone ONE!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBe a duck.  Let it roll off your back.  If they have their minds <br/>\nmade up, rarely does it change.  *Sometimes* grandparents can become <br/>\nwonderful advocates once they are proven that your methods work.  I <br/>\nmanaged to raise three beautiful (bias), healthy strong children and <br/>\nbreastfed them for extended periods of time, yet my parents still <br/>\ncan&#39;t equate breastfeeding to how they turned out.  They can&#39;t see <br/>\nthe &quot;big picture.&quot;  They can&#39;t imagine that &quot;the norm&quot; won&#39;t work <br/>\nfor everyone.  I&#39;ll never have those supportive grandparents.  It&#39;s <br/>\none reason that our wills are set up so that if Dan and I both die <br/>\nmy family is not getting custody of the children.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: family","postDate":"1107806155","msgId":4883,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNGRDdFQjI1LjY1OEMzOUUyLjBCOTdBM0ZCQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4882,"nextInTopic":4884,"prevInTime":4882,"nextInTime":4884,"topicId":4864,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m pretty loud and vocal about what we do.

(Or don&#39;t do.)  It doesn&#39;t come up<br/>\nvery often but once I wrote a long note to my father explaining unschooling<br/>\nto him after he question if they&#39;d ever learn math unless we sat down and<br/>\ntaught them.  I used all the things he&#39;s taught himself (wood working - and<br/>\nhe&#39;s great at it, ham radio, lots of other things)   as an example of how<br/>\npeople are motivated to learn something when it interests them and I think<br/>\nhe got it.  He wrote back a brief note that he understood and I haven&#39;t<br/>\nheard anymore.  That was maybe 2 years ago.  I used to send my mother<br/>\narticles on unschooling and things I wrote about unschooling and I assumed<br/>\nshe shared them with my father, but either I was wrong or he forgot.  Not<br/>\nsurprising.  They can have big communication gaps sometimes.  Once, my<br/>\nmother wrote back in response to one of my articles and said that she<br/>\nthought I was doing a great job with my kids.  She isn&#39;t one to lather on<br/>\npraise and that meant a lot to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy in-laws are great about it too.  Both of our families really value<br/>\nprivacy and not butting in where they don&#39;t belong, (an attribute of<br/>\nMainers, generally) so part of it is just that they don&#39;t want to be nosy<br/>\nmeddling in-laws.  The second part of the equation, I believe, is that they<br/>\nthink that we are both intelligent people who make good decisions overall<br/>\nand if we&#39;ve researched something (which we have and we can debate it pretty<br/>\nwell) and we believe it&#39;s good enough for our kids then they trust our<br/>\ndecisions.  We were both the rebellious type though and we&#39;d do it with or<br/>\nwithout their approval. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps that my kids are bright and curious.  We both come from families<br/>\nwho enjoy games and the girls can play any game with the best of them.  They<br/>\nrecently learned how to play Texas Hold &#39;Em and my 8 yo came away with $20<br/>\nafter a tournament.  She beat my whole family.  There were 11 people playing<br/>\nthat night and we&#39;d all put in $2.  I had put up her $2 for her, so her<br/>\nwinnings were $20.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth girls have taken to emailing  my mil who lives in Florida in the<br/>\nwinter.

With the inlaws, my Dad and even my sibs, I say homeschool.  I&#39;m pretty sure that no amount of explanation would result in my mother in law every accepting unschooling.  She&#39;s a retired K-3 teacher and my fil is a retired AF officer, and later gov&#39;t employee -- they just don&#39;t know how to live outside the box at all.<br/>\n <br/>\nI mentioned the concept to my sister early in our homeschooling years, and she totally freaked at the very idea -- things like &#39;so then what if your child never learns to read?  Will you still be reading things to them at 12 or 13 yrs old?&quot;  The sad part about that is that I think she&#39;d have made a great unschooler.  She was the very in-your-face non-conformist teenager who dropped out of high school at 16, but somehow in adulthood she&#39;s become very conformist -- I think it&#39;s fear-based.   It&#39;s really sad to see her become such a traditionalist parent, with her son in a &#39;pre-honors&#39; curriculum at the mid-school level. Even sadder, her daughter in the 1st grade was struggling, and finally earned a &#39;bug&#39; (bringing up grades) award at the end of the year.  What 6yo needs that kind of stress?  Ah well, maybe someday when she realizes how much her daughter is like she was.<br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!
