It<br/>\nis not a regular thing with this friend.  I think it<br/>\nmore had to do with feeling overwhelmed about some of<br/>\nthe reponses that our family is getting when we share<br/>\nthat we are unschooling and my &quot;stuff&quot; around it.   I<br/>\nam sooo grateful to be learning from all of you folks<br/>\nthat have gone before me and have shared that<br/>\nrespecting our children from the beginning is the only<br/>\nway to go.  This deschooling process is unraveling to<br/>\nmy core.   I have never sought knowledge and/of<br/>\nUNDERSTANDING such as this.  So many things happen<br/>\ndaily that I get to look at.  Trying to live in the<br/>\nmoment, say &quot;YES&quot; as much as I allow myself, and TRUST<br/>\nmyself.  So many things happen out in the world (with<br/>\nchildren).  I am trying to look at where it is coming<br/>\nfrom in regards to how I respond to my child and<br/>\nfinding a balance in saying &quot;yes&quot; more and being in<br/>\nharmony with our surroundings and some cases knowing<br/>\nwhen to change our sourroundings and some of the<br/>\npeople that we hang with.  I hope that I am not<br/>\nrambling too much.
