It was a gradual process for me and it <br/>\ntook a while.  I know a book that was a good starting point for me <br/>\nwas Living Joyfully With Children.  I would consider it the first <br/>\nstep towards being radical, as far as the philosophy spilling over <br/>\ninto other areas of my life.  It was the book that helped me shift <br/>\nmy thinking a little, give it a try!  I also recommend just reading, <br/>\nreading, reading, not just on the lists but any book on unschooling <br/>\nthat you can get your hands on.  I got onto half.com, using the <br/>\nrecommended list on unschooling.com, which doesn&#39;t exist anymore.  <br/>\nYou can get books for REALLY cheap there, most of mine I didn&#39;t pay <br/>\nmore than about $7 for.  Kelly, do you know where another <br/>\nrecommended book list is?  Maybe on unschooling.info?  Some that I <br/>\nenjoyed were The Art of Education, The Unschooling Handbook, Dumbing <br/>\nUs Down, any of John Holts books.  Maybe Kelly or some others would <br/>\nhave some book suggestions on ones that touched on the whole life <br/>\ninstead of just the school issue.  And if you didn&#39;t make it to the <br/>\nconference then maybe you could order tapes of the talks that took <br/>\nplace at the conference, they touch on just about everything.
