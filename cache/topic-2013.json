I wanted to put a few<br/>\nmore things out there that have helped me transform my thinking a lot<br/>\nregarding various things I feel like &quot;have&quot; to be done or that I &quot;have to&quot;<br/>\ndo them if no one else does.  This relates to what everyone is saying about<br/>\nfinding joy, and also to what is most fundamental to unschooling, &quot;it&#39;s all<br/>\nabout choice&quot;.  This is true for us parents as much as for our kids.  If we<br/>\nfeel enslaved to do things, rather than seeing how we are choosing to do<br/>\nthem, then our kids learn that dynamic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Marshall Rosenberg&#39;s &quot;Non-Violent Communication&quot; book he tells readers<br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t do anything that isn&#39;t play!&quot;  He means that it&#39;s important for us to<br/>\nmake choices &quot;motivated purely by our desire to contribute to life rather<br/>\nthan out of fear, guilt, shame, duty or obligation&quot;.  In other words, we<br/>\nshould be doing what contributes to joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis book really encouraged me to try to translate all my things I felt like<br/>\nI &quot;had to do&quot; into things I &quot;choose to do&quot; and to find out if there was<br/>\nanything life-affirming underneath.  He talks about a woman for example, who<br/>\ncame to his workshop and felt tremendous resentment that she &quot;had to&quot; make<br/>\ndinner for her family every night of the week.  He challenged her to<br/>\ntranslate this into &quot;choose to&quot; language and the result was that she found<br/>\nshe was choosing it out of obligation and guilt.  She stopped making all<br/>\nthose dinners and the result was that her kids were greatly relieved to have<br/>\na mom making joyful choices instead of a mom stamping around the house<br/>\nresentfully making this meal.  &quot;Thank goodness&quot;, they said, &quot;that mom<br/>\nstopped making dinner!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, changing to &quot;choose to&quot; can help us perform tasks that we<br/>\nare doing resentfully now with a different focus once we recognize the<br/>\njoyous reason we are choosing them.  One of the things that made Marshall&#39;s<br/>\nown list of &quot;have to&quot; things was driving the carpool.  He&#39;d get to his day<br/>\nand feel resentful that he &quot;had to&quot; do it again.  Once he translated this<br/>\ninto &quot;I choose to drive the carpool because I feel appreciation for the<br/>\nbenefits my children receive from attending their currrent school which they<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t get from the neighborhood school they could walk to&quot; it meant that<br/>\nhe drove the carpool with a different energy - that he could remind himself<br/>\nthat he was choosing to do this to benefit his children which was<br/>\nlife-affirming instead of feeling resentful that he &quot;had to&quot; do it.  (Okay,<br/>\nI know that&#39;s not a great unschooling example, but that&#39;s the one in his<br/>\nbook! and you get the drift...)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading Marshall&#39;s stuff on choice, I can see that personally, there<br/>\nis nothing that I &quot;have to&quot; do in life.  I make choices based on what I<br/>\nvalue, on what my needs are, on what&#39;s important to me.  I found it a<br/>\ntremedous exercise to sit down and &quot;free myself&quot; by making a list of all the<br/>\nthings I felt like I &quot;had to&quot; do and force myself to change my language to<br/>\n&quot;choose to&quot; and add why I was choosing that.  I got rid of some things I<br/>\nreally didn&#39;t want to choose.  I did many of the other things with a very<br/>\ndifferent feeling like Marshall&#39;s carpool.  And I was able to see that if I<br/>\nwant us to contribute as a family to doing something like cleaning the<br/>\nbathroom toilet, that the way it would work for me to go about that would be<br/>\nto approach them not in a way that says &quot;the bathroom has to be clean so we<br/>\nall have to do this&quot;, but in a way that says &quot;Mom chooses to clean the<br/>\nbathroom because I feel good when it&#39;s clean, my nose likes it better, and<br/>\nbecause hygeine is important to me.  Since we all use the bathroom, I sure<br/>\nwould like some help.  How do you all feel about the bathroom being clean<br/>\nand would you be willing to help me keep it that way?&quot;  And we&#39;d work it out<br/>\nfrom there.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan (still loving NVC and feeling it is SO compatible to unschooling<br/>\nphilosophy in many ways)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":171127956,"authorName":"G&M Contracting Inc., Kenneth Gillilan","from":"&quot;G&M Contracting Inc., Kenneth Gillilan&quot; &lt;gmcontractinginc@...&gt;","profile":"vermontones","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] guys and toilets","postDate":"1089898750","msgId":2083,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVBRUFJSkpKSURLSUFCTUVOT0hJTUVORENEQUEuZ21jb250cmFjdGluZ2luY0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzE1MDA0NTQ0LjQwNTY0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzODA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2077,"nextInTopic":2088,"prevInTime":2082,"nextInTime":2084,"topicId":2013,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... penis  Syl, Yes that it is the problem with my one uncircumcised boy here, but the true culprit is my oldest son who IS circumcised.

If I gave that impression, it was a <br/>\nmistake. They just don&#39;t like to clean the toilet. And maybe because <br/>\nI(and my daughter) sit all the time when we use the restroom, we <br/>\nnotice when it needs to be cleaned more often then my guys do. But <br/>\njust because they don&#39;t notice the toilet, it does not mean that it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t need to be cleaned. <br/>\nI grew up in a all female(5)household and we still needed to clean <br/>\nthe toilet on a regular basis. And there&#39;s where the job of cleaning <br/>\nit comes in. Who&#39;s job/chore is it in your house? Only Mom and/or <br/>\nDad? Why? The point I was trying to make about toilets is that I <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe that the only person in the household who has to do <br/>\nthat type of job is the person who would be bothered by it if it is <br/>\nnot done. <br/>\nAnd as a side comment, my husband and sons are very thoughtful about <br/>\nputting down the toilet seat after they use it. Not because I nag <br/>\nthem about it, but because it is one of the nice things they do for <br/>\nme, just like I always return their brushes back to the bathroom <br/>\nafter they have used them somewhere else in the house without <br/>\ncomment so that they can find them in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake Care,<br/>\nErika<br/>\n&quot;I am learning all the time, the tombstone will be my diploma&quot;- <br/>\nEartha Kitt</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141910957,"authorName":"Valerie","from":"&quot;Valerie&quot; &lt;valerie@...&gt;","profile":"valfitz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: guys and toilets","postDate":"1089825188","msgId":2035,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNkM3BqNCtlOGRsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJEMUFEMDQyLjI5MTE2JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":2034,"nextInTopic":2036,"prevInTime":2034,"nextInTime":2036,"topicId":2013,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We call them Cheerios! ... aiming at.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1435393056\">We call them Cheerios!<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve heard there are flushable bulls eyes for them to practice <br/>\n </span></blockquote>aiming at.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Maybe those would work for husbands too ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Joyce </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren","from":"&quot;Ren&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"guys and toilets","postDate":"1089822690","msgId":2034,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzE0LjA5MzEzNy4yOTU3My4zMDA1MDVAd2VibWFpbDA1Lm55Yy51bnRkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":2033,"nextInTopic":2035,"prevInTime":2033,"nextInTime":2035,"topicId":2013,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"As for that other important issue, raising the seat...I never harped  on mine to put it back down.
