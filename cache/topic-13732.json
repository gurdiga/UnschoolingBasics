They&#39;ve been on a soft food diet <br/>\nsince, which has been challenging and frustrating for them. They made a shopping <br/>\nlist for me earlier in the week, and we&#39;ve also run out for stuff as they&#39;ve <br/>\nthought of what sounded appealing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I had teeth removed I ate a lot of mushy canned vegetables, but my girls <br/>\nhave grown up loving fresh and frozen veggies and think canned veggies are <br/>\njust gross, so those didn&#39;t make it onto their food plans. They&#39;ve ended up <br/>\neating a lot of yogurt, pudding, canned fruit, bananas, mashed potatoes, some <br/>\nmushy pastas, plain bread. Yesterday they started complaining that they were tired <br/>\ntired tired of eating sweet stuff. Today they were able to handle chewing <br/>\nscrambled eggs and omelettes which thrilled them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13728,"nextTopicId":13634}}
