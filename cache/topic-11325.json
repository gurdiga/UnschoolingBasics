Am I expecting too much, too soon?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can really relate to you. (sorry if this is a bit long but I feel for you!) <br/>\nI was the same way when we first started. Our dd&#39;s are 11 & 12, we pulled <br/>\nthem out of school 17 months ago. (one was in 4th & one in 5th grade) We had <br/>\nintended on doing curriculum initially, decided to let them DEschool for a while <br/>\nand soon after that I got a bit freaked out that they weren&#39;t learning anything <br/>\nand began taking them on a lot of field trips with hs groups and by <br/>\nourselves. They very quickly began hating to go any where! I was so surprised! I <br/>\nfigured that they would want to get out and about but they were soooo drained from <br/>\nall those yrs. in school. I think they were &quot;tired&quot; and their brains were <br/>\n&quot;tired&quot; so we quit &quot;doing and going&quot; and we just let them &quot;be and do&quot; on their own <br/>\nand I watched them slowly start coming around. They seemed more relaxed and <br/>\nhappier as time went on. At the same time I had been reading more about <br/>\nunschooling and I could see that that was exactly what we needed in our lives and from <br/>\nthen on, we never looked back.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are definitely expecting too much, but I don&#39;t think you should kick <br/>\nyourself for wondering if you are, it&#39;s hard not to at first and I think it&#39;s all <br/>\na part of &quot;your&quot; learning and growing right a long with your son. (which, for <br/>\nme, was such a wonderful reality!:o) It can be sort of scary pulling your kid <br/>\nout and just letting him go, but we (and so many others here) are living proof <br/>\nthat it DOES work and all will be &quot;ok&quot;! <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids still sit at the computer a lot, watch tv a lot and play outside a <br/>\nlot, BUT, that is not all they do now! They are into 4-H with their <br/>\nanimals....dog obedience classes, horse shows and clinics, volunteering with their club, <br/>\n(all this is LOTS of learning, but they are doing it on their terms, nothing <br/>\nwrong with that, that&#39;s how I learn best too:o) They have just started their own <br/>\nbusiness selling eggs from their chickens. They are raising some new chicks <br/>\nthat they bought right now and are planning on mating one of last yrs. hens <br/>\nwith their new rooster so that they can hatch some out themselves in the <br/>\nincubator and also have one of the hens hatch a few. All of this will require that <br/>\nthey learn about how to do it, again they are doing it on their own and it&#39;s all <br/>\npretty much things they probably wouldn&#39;t have done when they were in school, <br/>\nthey would have been too tired, busy with school work and so turned off at <br/>\nlearning anything after sitting in a class rm. all day being forced) They are <br/>\nalso into figure skating and are able to do it way more now than if they were in <br/>\nschool. (they & their coach love going during the school day, they have the <br/>\nplace to themselves:o) They read books & magazines that &quot;they want&quot; to read, <br/>\nwhen they feel like it, which, for them is a lot, they both happen to like <br/>\nreading, but hated forced reading in school and who doesn&#39;t! Our oldest was told in <br/>\nthe 3rd grade by a teacher that &quot;she just wasn&#39;t good at math and that she <br/>\nbetter study a lot harder or she wouldn&#39;t be able to make it once she got up to <br/>\nthe 5th grade&quot; She always did great in school, but had a bit of trouble in <br/>\nmath. Ya know what that did to her? In her eyes it told her that she was dumb, <br/>\nthat she just wasn&#39;t capable of learning math, so, she ended up HATING math and <br/>\nall of her other grades went down hill that yr. Since unschooling, there are no <br/>\ngrades and we have never forced anything on them, including math and the <br/>\nother day, my Katie, the one who fought me tooth and nail about doing math when <br/>\nshe was in school said &quot;Ya know what Mom? I actually like math now, it&#39;s fun!&quot; <br/>\n(of course I about fell over) and she continued with,  &quot;I am good at it and I <br/>\nknow I always could have been.&quot; (she said that with a grin) &quot;I just didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto do it when I was in school. I was just like that because if I didn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand  something in math I always felt like they thought I was stupid. I hated <br/>\nbeing embarrassed about it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think at the beginning our kids had this huge & overwhelming feeling of <br/>\nrelief, they needed that time to just &quot;be&quot; without any pressures from anything or <br/>\nanyone.... what a liberating feeling that must have been for them. &lt;g&gt; You <br/>\nare doing such a great thing for your son and he will thank you for it and you <br/>\nwill thank yourself. Our whole family has benefited from unschooling. Our <br/>\nfamily is closer and we seem to have this unique bond between us now that I think <br/>\nschooled families unfortunately cannot obtain.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes to you on your journey, it is a fun one!<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Pampered Chef Michelle","from":"&quot;Pampered Chef Michelle&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Am I expecting to much?","postDate":"1144417178","msgId":11353,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA0MDcwNjM5bTI5ODk0MTM0cGUyM2M5NDRjYTM5YTA5ZGRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGUxNW9zZithdnQzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGUxNW9zZithdnQzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11352,"nextInTopic":11354,"prevInTime":11352,"nextInTime":11354,"topicId":11325,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If you want him to read, it needs to be something about his interests.  And he is already &quot;exploring things&quot; and &quot;taking on projects.&quot;  I wonder if you expected him to decide to study something more school-ish.  Maybe take on a project like building his own Egyptian pyramid from card board.  I know there are kids that are way into ancient Egypt, but it sounds like your kid is the more physical type.  And he is developing the interests that are important to him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I want to make sure you understand that unschooling is going to look a lot like what you are seeing right now.  This is your son without school.  You don&#39;t have a bookish kid.  You have your son, and he sounds fabulous just the way he is!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo unschool, you take those interests that you listed, and make sure he has what he needs to persue those interests--like other people that are also interested in those things.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI am always late on adding to the discussion here, but I really want to point out that other replies to this topic make it sound like after your son is finished deschooling, then he will do more things that look like what you were expecting.

A general guideline I&#39;ve seen is to allow one month of deschooling for every year spent in school.  Your son was in the 4th or 5th grade, so at least 5 or 6 months of time for him.  And how long were you in school?  Probably the usual 12 to 16, right?  So allow a year or more for yourself to get the hang of this whole unschooling life.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  For today -- and the rest of your days?  Breathe.  Read all you can here an at the favorite unschooling websites -- there are a bunch of links at this group&#39;s homepage.  Read at Sandra&#39;s site, and Joyce&#39;s, and Ren&#39;s and Danielle&#39;s.  See if you can get a copy of Rue&#39;s book, or Sandra&#39;s book.  Stay up late. Sleep late. Make a big, fun breakfast together. Watch your son ride his bike or play basketball.  Just for fun -- not to see if he&#39;s improved, or if he&#39;s &#39;had enough&#39; fun.  Go to the zoo, or the park, or anywhere he wants to go.  Learn to play his favorite video game with him. Read. Be silly.  Explore the real world around you.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Read about and consider attending the upcoming Live & Learn conference in Albuquerque. We&#39;ll be there (we live in Abq) with our 10 year old son this September.  It&#39;s at www.liveandlearnconference.org. Or find your way to the L&L conf yahoo group.
