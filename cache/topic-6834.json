I don&#39;t consider it<br/>\n&quot;studying&quot; because we don&#39;t set out to engage in<br/>\nactivity because of its educational value (there is<br/>\nnot a pursuit of knowledge).  We do things because we<br/>\nwant to, because we enjoy them, regardless of what we<br/>\nmight learn from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do you deal with the state?  I imagine it must<br/>\n&gt; be next to impossible to come up with a learning<br/>\n&gt; plan when you allow them to learn at their own pace.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Every state is different, so I encourage you to ask<br/>\nthis question of someone who is unschooling in VT<br/>\n(someone here might be).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not impossible to create a learning plan when<br/>\nyour state requires it and your are unschooling. <br/>\nUsually it just takes a bit of creativity on your<br/>\npart.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Regarding deschooling - if I use the formula below<br/>\n&gt; it would be YEARS before they were ready to learn<br/>\n&gt; again! LOL.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your children are learning now, all the time.  Even if<br/>\nyour son plays his gamecube from the moment he gets up<br/>\nto the moment he goes to sleep, he is still learning. <br/>\nLearning doesn&#39;t just happen when you are requiring<br/>\nschoolwork or schoolish activities. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; forcing huge amounts of bookwork anymore - it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; worth the headache, but I am trying to get through<br/>\n&gt; some of it each day or every other day.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But you are still forcing it.  It doesn&#39;t matter if<br/>\nyou are doing it a little or a lot.  Forcing is<br/>\nforcing.  Forcing, or requiring, bookwork isn&#39;t going<br/>\nto make them learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m trying<br/>\n&gt; to follow their cues - if it looks like a bad day<br/>\n&gt; for bookwork then I make sure they do their chores<br/>\n&gt; and try to keep them semi engaged.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by semi-engaged.  Do you<br/>\nmean that you try to keep them engaged in things that<br/>\nyou feel are worthwhile?  Even without your<br/>\nrequirement of bookwork, chores, etc., your children<br/>\nwill generally always be engaged in something -- maybe<br/>\nTV, gamecube, watching the weather channel.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some days are<br/>\n&gt; just gamecube days - <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would start letting them decide everyday if today is<br/>\ngamecube day.  Believe me, you&#39;ll be amazed at how<br/>\ngreat life will be with them if you let go of your<br/>\ncontrols on things like this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I didn&#39;t force him<br/>\n&gt; to sit down and work on it.  They have a list of one<br/>\n&gt; weeks worth of &#39;bookwork&#39; that is a framework for<br/>\n&gt; what they need to accomplish.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So, yes, he was forced.  Having a list of one weeks<br/>\nworth of bookwork, even when they get the choice of<br/>\nwhen, within that week, to do it, is still forcing. <br/>\nEven if you make subtle hints that they should do<br/>\nbookbook, that is still a form of force.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s hard for me because I really just want to set<br/>\n&gt; them loose but I&#39;m so tied to &#39;traditional&#39;<br/>\n&gt; education.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree, it can be hard.  Our family hasn&#39;t always<br/>\nbeen unschooling.  My two oldest children attended<br/>\npublic school for several years.  When I first learned<br/>\nof unschooling, I was intrigued.  But I joined lists,<br/>\nlike this, and thought that the unschoolers on it were<br/>\nnuts.  I mean, how could I not require schoolwork? <br/>\nHow could I just let them play the Playstation all<br/>\nday?  How would my kids learn if I didn&#39;t at least<br/>\nrequire them to do things that seemed &quot;educational&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI truly wanted unschooling to work for my children and<br/>\nour family, so I didn&#39;t give up.  I read everyday<br/>\nabout unschooling.  I read on websites, in books, on<br/>\nlists like this.  The more I learned, the more I could<br/>\nsee how unschooling does work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love how our life is now -- they love life more.  If<br/>\nyou truly want it to work, it will, but it take a lot<br/>\nof learning on your part, a lot of getting rid of your<br/>\ncurrent way of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandie <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tableforfive.blogspot.com\">http://tableforfive.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homemadeliving.blogspot.com\">http://homemadeliving.blogspot.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

Even if you <br/>\njoin a homeschool support group, you&#39;ll often find unschoolers there <br/>\ntoo.  Also, is one of the yahoo groups you recently joined <br/>\nNewEnglandUnschoolers?  (I&#39;m there too!).   They&#39;re not as busy <br/>\nsometimes, but someone there from VT might pop in to give you some <br/>\nstate specific advice (and here as well!).   Make sure you post your <br/>\ntopic specific enough to grab attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have 3 choices in MA of assessment-standardized testing, portfolio <br/>\nof dated work samples or a narrative report.  We decided to do the <br/>\nnarrative.    Here&#39;s a sample of an unschooling curriculum. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ben is a reader.  he loves Lord of the Rings and has shown an <br/>\n </span></blockquote>interest in history as well.  He HATES math.  He just told me he&#39;d <br/>\nlike to just sit here and read all day... sounds good to me!!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGREAT!  Let go and let him read all day!  My dd hates math too! (but <br/>\nalso doesn&#39;t like to read for pleasure, but I know she can read, she <br/>\nreads for necessity, ie the book of the computer game she&#39;s currently <br/>\nabsorbed with).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (yes we still have times when they aren&#39;t allowed to use it - <br/>\n </span></blockquote>either as punishment or because we&#39;d like to see them do something <br/>\nelse - I&#39;m learning to let go in baby steps).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, read as much as you can about unschooling.  Especially pay <br/>\nattention when respecting our children is discussed.  Children learn <br/>\nto respect when we treat THEM with respect, not punish them when they <br/>\ndon&#39;t do something the way WE think they should.   Learn to TRUST.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s a hard leap.   But I HAVE seen a tremendous change in my dd and <br/>\nin our relationship since we&#39;ve &quot;let go&quot; of traditional ways of <br/>\nlooking at education.

It <br/>\nnever felt right, so I kept researching and reading and now realize <br/>\nit&#39;s that her learning style (visual/spatial - picture thinker, right <br/>\nbrained, non-sequential learner) doesn&#39;t fit the way most teachers <br/>\nteach - sequentially (can look a lot like ADHD).   Plus the first <br/>\nyear of middle school was tough for her, changing classes, she needs <br/>\nmore time to transition and more time to finish work to completion.   <br/>\nBeing at home allows her to finish things (and I&#39;m NOT talking math <br/>\nworksheets!) at her own pace.   She really has a bad taste in her <br/>\nmouth about math because of last year, and we&#39;re not going to do <br/>\nanything remotely like what she was &quot;studying&quot; last year until she <br/>\nwants to or needs to.   She was getting migraine headaches quite a <br/>\nbit at the end of last year, none since she&#39;s been &quot;FREE&quot;!   And it&#39;s <br/>\nmade such a difference in her to be able to sleep as long as she <br/>\nneeds (they DO need a lot at this age) and pursue her passions as she <br/>\nheals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started looking into homeschooling 2+ years ago and about a year <br/>\nago came across the word &quot;unschooling&quot;.  At first it sounded WAY too <br/>\nloose for me, but I kept coming back to it, something about it <br/>\nresonated in me.

I&#39;m trying to follow their cues - if it looks like a bad day for bookwork then I make sure they do their chores and try to keep them semi engaged.
