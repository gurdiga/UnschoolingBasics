I wish<br/>\nmore families had your perspective!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m actually prelingually Deaf, was reading at age 3. Unfortunately<br/>\nbooks continued to be my escape because there, I could get 100% of<br/>\nwhat people said. I was mainstreamed until 8th grade. In that<br/>\nenvironment I still felt broken and incomplete despite being a &quot;poster<br/>\ngirl&quot; for mainstreaming. I scored well on tests and made the grade<br/>\nnever mind being very lonely and limping along signing English.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven today I get accosted by people asking abt the implant should I<br/>\never need a trip to the ear doctor or audiologist. It would be nice to<br/>\nbe asked if I want the services of an ASL specialist for my kids.<br/>\nBecause I do and have searched for that and it apparently doesn&#39;t<br/>\nexist in NC :,(<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for juggling and writing about it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAdrean<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 3/6/08, diana jenner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hahamommy@...\">hahamommy@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; On Wed, Mar 5, 2008 at 8:37 PM, Adrean Clark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adreanaline@...\">adreanaline@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; On 3/5/08, diana jenner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hahamommy@...\">hahamommy@...</a> &lt;hahamommy%40gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why a child that is blind from birth is not able to have those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bionicle eyes they&#39;re experimenting with now....the sight neural<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pathways never got developed, so the brain wouldn&#39;t know what to do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with that information.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Same hearing cannot be *restored* with a cochlear implant if someone is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pre-lingually Deaf.___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Diana&#39;s comment abt the cochlear implant is correct, except that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; implant does not &quot;restore&quot; hearing at all.
