Looking at things through unschooling eyes is starting to become more automatic.  For instance, today on our way home my younger dd said she wanted a lolipop.  I had gotten her one earlier at the bank and her older sister was having hers.  I explained she already had hers but she insisted she wanted another one. So I said, &quot;what color will you get next time?&quot;  We talked about different colors and flavors and which were our favorite and low and behold the tantrum ended.  I also took her to the park while the older one was at art class. When it was time to pick my older dd up I made a game of catch Mommy and ran to the car with my younger dd laughing and chasing behind me.  We still have tantrums, but I am finding that if I just sit back, relax and try to turn the situation into something fun it isn&#39;t so bad.
