Will tomorrow. DH found it . But Im very happy dh says it has a fenced in backyard and a concrete slab in back of the house. Of course we&#39;d have to be careful of how hot the concrete gets but Im thinking yes! the perfect place that I can give him whipped cream , pudding, peanut butter etc to play in. <br/>\n  Lol! Im sure the neighbors will think Im crazy when they see him and more than likely my 3 year old covered in peanut butter on a regular basis. <br/>\n  Sigh but if they only knew how much it reduces the amount of poop I have to clean off my walls! ( sorry to all those non autistic parents :) <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Courtney seems to really be leaning towards going to public school this year....at least for a while she says . I really wish she wouldnt but I feel like I need to give her room and let her go if thats what she really wants. <br/>\n  I think part of it *is* her needing more of a break from her brother and thats ok I understand.......Id just like to find a different way.

I wont ever and Im always searching for ways to help him . I do want to learn more about using aba.........Id love to see him get potty trained. However I came to the conclusion quickly after his diagnosis that I was much more interested in helping him be happy and content with himself and his own life than trying to force him to live up to society&#39;s standards. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nSee the all-new, redesigned Yahoo.com.

I think unschooling is about the best thing that has","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-404460885\">Nicole,<br/>\nI wanted to reply to this onlist, because I think it&#39;s a good  <br/>\ndiscussion to have for everyone. I think unschooling is about the  <br/>\nbest thing that has ever happened to our kids, autistic or not. We  <br/>\nspent five years in the public school arena, and what we saw was as  <br/>\nexpectations got higher, the supports for her did not get any better,  <br/>\nand her stress levels were greatly increased. As those levels  <br/>\nincreased, her coping mechanisms decreased, and it made her syndrome  <br/>\nappear much more severe. Her SIB&#39;s (self-injurious behaviors) were  <br/>\nmuch more violent, and her stims were more frequent. I would say  <br/>\nshe&#39;s moderate. She&#39;s functionally nonverbal, she&#39;s echolalic, she  <br/>\nengages in a lot of selfstim throughout the day. She has no social  <br/>\nskills or imaginative play. She hurts herself quite severely,  <br/>\nalthough once she was out of school that got to a point where she was  <br/>\nno longer making herself bleed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have made some big adjustments. We lived for so long believing  <br/>\nthat for Breanna to be &#39;healed&#39; we had to do 40 hours of intervention  <br/>\nevery week, sitting at the table, managing and teaching her stuff.  <br/>\nI&#39;m sure that just increased her stress levels. WHen I finally  <br/>\nreached the point where I decided that her autism was not as  <br/>\nimportant as who she is and the family, things got better. We still  <br/>\nhave expectations for her, the same ones as for everyone else. She  <br/>\nmight need more help getting there, and we provide a lot of supports.  <br/>\nWe realized it wasn&#39;t important for her to be able to imagine, if she  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t disabled we would just say she prefers to engage in other  <br/>\nthings, right? And as an adult, how many people sit around playing  <br/>\ndolls, so how functional is it to teach her that? lol! We&#39;ve accepted  <br/>\nher for what she is, and what she can do, and once we did that, she  <br/>\nstarted doing more. Instead of sitting at a table all the time, she&#39;s  <br/>\nlearning real world stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, things will get better. I know that  when Breanna was  <br/>\nyounger a lot of time went to her because she was still learning.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s probably still getting more on her bad days that the other kids  <br/>\ndo. My kids understood a lot because we talked a lot one-on-one (when  <br/>\ndh would watch the kids and I could take one out on a date) about  <br/>\nautism, about Breanna, about how they felt their lives were going,  <br/>\netc. They knew that even though she was getting bigger, her brain was  <br/>\nstill like a baby. So that helped, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve done that,  <br/>\nbut there are some good things online if you google &#39;kids autism&#39;.  <br/>\nThat one on one time is important, so try to set that up where  <br/>\nsomeone can just keep Nate, and you can take Courtney out to even  <br/>\njust get a soda and fries. Throughout the day I make sure Breanna is  <br/>\nset up with something she likes, and then be sure to spend that time  <br/>\nconnecting. One thing to do is have a dry erase board, so when your  <br/>\ngirls ask about something, be sure to say something positive, instead  <br/>\nof the maybe later, say THat sounds like a great idea. Lets write  <br/>\nthat down and we&#39;ll do it as soon as Nate is settled. Then give him a  <br/>\ntray with peanut butter to play in.
