Simon and Linnaea only really get to <br/>\nplay with other unschooled children when we go to the U.S. or when the U.S. <br/>\ncomes to us, or on-line. There are a few exceptions to that, but largely that&#39;s <br/>\naccurate. Finding folks outside of the unschooling world would seem to be a <br/>\nreasonable option. If the unschooling world isn&#39;t satisfying your child&#39;s needs <br/>\nI would find other means to that end. Quit banging your head against the <br/>\nunschooling wall, if there isn&#39;t a door, don&#39;t demand one be made for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry that there isn&#39;t a way in. I&#39;m sorry that your child is being kept <br/>\nout, not being allowed to play. I&#39;m sorry that you are seeing someone else as <br/>\nkeeping your child from getting what he/she needs. I would look for more than <br/>\none route to getting her access to his/her friends and the community that he/she <br/>\nwants. And look for ways that she/he can join in on the things that she/he feels <br/>\nexcluded from. Presumably there is only one gathering that this family is <br/>\nresponsible for, that leaves y&#39;all quite a few others to go to. Presumably there <br/>\nis only one Not Back to School Camp that the other child attends, if that&#39;s part <br/>\nof the access being disputed, that leaves another one open, with the excitement <br/>\nof travel and connecting with a whole other world of community to access. Or <br/>\nmaybe, just figuring out how to attend something when someone you don&#39;t get on <br/>\nwith is also in attendance wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing to explore. <br/>\n<br/>\nLook outside unschooling. Find other things to do, other people to do things <br/>\nwith. Don&#39;t necessarily look to children of the same age, find other folks. Have <br/>\ndinner parties with people you all enjoy. Find things to do together, cool and <br/>\nconnected things. Things that are all about joy and laughter. If you can afford <br/>\nit, go somewhere else for a few days. If you can&#39;t, figure out how to go <br/>\nsomewhere fun and different and away from all the thoughts of connection that he <br/>\nor she feels is missing from his or her life. Fill up his/her life with things <br/>\nthat he&#39;s/she&#39;s wanted to do but you&#39;ve not managed to make the time for or the <br/>\nfunds available for or the attention for. Get a book that you two can read <br/>\ntogether. Go to some nearby town or city for the release of Harry Potter and <br/>\ndress up as someone from the movie. Big it up! Whatever it is that makes your <br/>\nchild smile do more of.

Relational aggression in females is quite common...less so in<br/>\nmales. And it&#39;s important because if it&#39;s RA (and these are girls) then<br/>\nthere are more kids involved in this than just one. A Queen Bee has to have<br/>\nher support system to make RA work well. If that&#39;s the case, then there are<br/>\nMANY other parents you could speak to. Those girls who are supporting the<br/>\nQueen Bee are weak and complicit in the RA. As a parent, I&#39;d want to know<br/>\nif my daughter was so weak she would participate in this kind of<br/>\npsychological/emotional abuse. (Because not only is it not nice to the<br/>\ntarget girl, but that means my child will go along with anything and I would<br/>\nwant to know that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf these are boys, then it&#39;s traditionally called bullying but *usually*<br/>\nit&#39;s much less severe because boys are usually more open about their<br/>\nnegative feelings, they might have a fight and then it&#39;s usually over. (As<br/>\na parent I&#39;d still want to know if my kid was a party to this behavior too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think we toss the term &quot;teen&quot; around too freely. A 13 yr old is<br/>\ntechnically a teen but is MILES away from a 17 yr old developmentally. How<br/>\nold are these &quot;teens&quot;? Because if they are young teens, they really are<br/>\nmore like little kids than smaller sized adults. If they are older kids,<br/>\nsay 17 or so...then it&#39;s less about the parents and more about the kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;d feel like I wasn&#39;t being honest if I didn&#39;t put this in this post so<br/>\nhere goes. If your child has turned to self-injury and suicidal ideation<br/>\nover being snubbed by one kid/multiple kids but your child is unschooled and<br/>\nsupported in all other areas of their life, then you need to get your kid to<br/>\ncounseling because your child has WAY more going on that just this one<br/>\nsituation. Sure, no one likes to be snubbed/bullied but since this isn&#39;t<br/>\nschool and your kid isn&#39;t exposed to this situation 8 hours a day 185 days a<br/>\nyear, it seems to me to be a VERY extreme reaction to an unpleasant<br/>\nsituation. I&#39;M NOT SAYING YOUR KID HAS NO RIGHT TO BE UPSET!! I&#39;m saying<br/>\nthat talking about killing yourself and cutting is way too severe a reaction<br/>\nfor the situation AS YOU DESCRIBE IT. (And if these are girls we are<br/>\ntalking about I&#39;d be sure to look at your child for signs of an eating<br/>\ndisorder or BDD because this reaction is just too strong if your child is<br/>\nmentally healthy and robust at all other times.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLET ME REPEAT...that doesn&#39;t mean that your kid shouldn&#39;t be upset. That<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean that the kid that is doing this isn&#39;t a horrid human being.<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean that if her (I&#39;m assuming) parents know she&#39;s like this<br/>\nand they haven&#39;t done anything about it that they aren&#39;t complicit and also<br/>\nhorrible people. (Yeah that statement will likely get me in trouble but I<br/>\nthink if as a parent you support RA/Bullying in your kid...you are a<br/>\nhorrible person.) BUT I am saying that if your child has been pushed out of<br/>\ntheir primary social group but that group attendance was only say about 3%<br/>\nof your child&#39;s total yearly socializing time then trying to kill herself<br/>\nand cutting is a sign that there are other, perhaps much more severe<br/>\nmaladaptive behaviors in your child that you should be vigilant about<br/>\nattending to.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I&#39;d go straight to the parents of this precious darling and tell<br/>\nthem what&#39;s going on. And to support my child I&#39;d show her that if there<br/>\nare ugly people about...MOVE. Remove yourselves from the group. Gather all<br/>\nthe other kids this has happened to and start your own gatherings. BOOT the<br/>\nbully from the group. If, as you say, there are a bunch of kids this has<br/>\nhappened to then there are a bunch of kids looking for their primary social<br/>\ngroup back. Start it yourself. AND if there are a bunch of other kids this<br/>\nhas happened to, then go as a group of parents and say to the bully&#39;s<br/>\nparents....&quot;Darling Jane here has taken to terrorizing all of our<br/>\nchildren.&quot; If those parents, popular or not can look into the eyes of 8<br/>\nother families and see that everyone has had enough of this girl and her<br/>\nvenom, and they do nothing....then as I said it&#39;s time to start a new<br/>\ngroup. However...if those other parents won&#39;t speak up...then they are also<br/>\nweak and complicit. And they are willing to sacrifice their children to be<br/>\n&quot;popular&quot; with the &quot;popular&quot; parents. And should you really be a party to a<br/>\ngroup like that?

We have also encountered situations where a child was mean to other, and excluded others, without really having the sway of a queen bee.  Both situations are painful, and can leave you and your child feeling powerless.  It&#39;s the kind of scenario that tends to put us back into our high school roles, especially if we suffered the same slights as our child. <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that if your child is so upset as to be talking about self-injury or suicide, you may need more help walking thru this time than any online group can offer.  Some children are more sensitive than others.  Some adults are very sensitive.  I have two children who fit that description, and both quickly can devolve to reactions that are self-endangering, tho not specifically injurious, so I know that sometimes one stress is all it takes.  It&#39;s an intensity of feeling my children get from me.  For me and my children, the challenge is finding a solution that helps my child safe face (that&#39;s not really the best descriptive term, but it&#39;s the best I have right now. No one wants their private pain made public, and few children want Mom to make the other children be nice to them).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to talking to the parents of the child, it&#39;s likely you know better than anyone else whether this is an option.  I have seen parents who -- on principle -- will not involve themselves in responding to any of their child&#39;s social behaviors.  This has left me unwilling to speak to some parents, choosing instead to help my child move thru and beyond his loss and help him to find new friends. Only you can know whether or not speaking to other parents would help in your situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome thoughts I had....  <br/>\n<br/>\nSurely this child doesn&#39;t attend EVERY unschooling conference or gathering.  Are there gatherings -- online or in person -- where your child can find new friendships, either among homeschoolers, unschoolers or even mainstream kids with similar interests? <br/>\n<br/>\nHow about among the previously spurned friends? Do any of those children have anything in common with your child? <br/>\n<br/>\nOr you could start a new group, or just smaller gatherings with friends you know to be safe. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could explore other groups where your child may have a common interest.  Unschoolers don&#39;t have to be the only friend pool you draw from (tho I have one child who simply won&#39;t even try other sources, so I know that can be a challenge). <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, given how deeply this has upset your child, maybe it&#39;s time for a season of at-home family time.  With the holidays coming up, it might be just the time to snuggle in and provide your child with a safe, warm place to regain confidence and to find what she needs to move thru this pain; to learn about and appreciate her own value? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt it is so hard to see our children in pain.  We&#39;ve walked thru some unimaginable pain this past year with one of our sons, and in previous years with another son.  I know there is a brighter day on the other side. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Help needed with unschooling community issue","postDate":"1289233315","msgId":45263,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGliOTgzMytmdHY2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGliNzdvYSttdDA0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45262,"nextInTopic":45264,"prevInTime":45262,"nextInTime":45264,"topicId":45259,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *************** I m glad its getting better.

Keep in mind, though, that while all of this may have been a trigger, depression this serious doesn&#39;t just arise out of being snubbed socially. There are bigger and longer standing issues at work and its important to look for ways to help that are much more far reaching than this one issue. Don&#39;t let the social stuff be a &quot;scapegoat&quot; for other problems. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;we have also discovered that there are lots of kids this has happened to with this individual<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could start a support group. YOu could organize events and outtings to be inclusive of some of these other kids. By saying the parents of the one child are &quot;prominent&quot; I take it to mean they do a lot of organizing, and that may be part of the problem. Other people need to step up and redistribute the work load of setting things up for local unschoolers and give this family a break. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, keep in mind that its not necessary to include everyone all the time. That goes as much for your kid as other kids - every unschooling kid in the local community isn&#39;t going to get along with every other, or have the same interests. Especially as kids get older, that can mean that &quot;unschooling&quot; events are less appealing to kids who have nothing in common but unschooling itself. So orgainize activities that are interest based, not &quot;lets do something fun for/with unschoolers&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The parents seem to pay no attention to what their child does to other kids.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nDo they know? Its surprisingly common for people to not tell parents about issues with their kids and yet assume the parents know. Just because people are unschooling doesn&#39;t mean they haven&#39;t succumed to that particular mistake. Assume the parents don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. How can you let them know their teen is having some social problems and needs more support? Are you uncomfortable approaching these parents and starting a conversation with them?<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 17)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"Karen Swanay &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Help needed with unschooling community issue","postDate":"1289223101","msgId":45261,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlteUdfNE83X0dOOWZzN1VkcDd4MVFiSFFDM0JiYTJzOGRqX1I4SkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGliNzdvYSttdDA0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGliNzdvYSttdDA0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45260,"nextInTopic":45262,"prevInTime":45260,"nextInTime":45262,"topicId":45259,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think it s important to say what sex your child is as well as that of the bully.  Relational aggression in females is quite common...less so in males.  And","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1970147251\">I think it&#39;s important to say what sex your child is as well as that of the<br/>\nbully.  Relational aggression in females is quite common...less so in<br/>\nmales.  And it&#39;s important because if it&#39;s RA (and these are girls) then<br/>\nthere are more kids involved in this than just one.  A Queen Bee has to have<br/>\nher support system to make RA work well.  If that&#39;s the case, then there are<br/>\nMANY other parents you could speak to.  Those girls who are supporting the<br/>\nQueen Bee are weak and complicit in the RA.  As a parent, I&#39;d want to know<br/>\nif my daughter was so weak she would participate in this kind of<br/>\npsychological/emotional abuse.  (Because not only is it not nice to the<br/>\ntarget girl, but that means my child will go along with anything and I would<br/>\nwant to know that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf these are boys, then it&#39;s traditionally called bullying but *usually*<br/>\nit&#39;s much less severe because boys are usually more open about their<br/>\nnegative feelings, they might have a fight and then it&#39;s usually over.  (As<br/>\na parent I&#39;d still want to know if my kid was a party to this behavior too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think we toss the term &quot;teen&quot; around too freely.  A 13 yr old is<br/>\ntechnically a teen but is MILES away from a 17 yr old developmentally.  How<br/>\nold are these &quot;teens&quot;?  Because if they are young teens, they really are<br/>\nmore like little kids than smaller sized adults.  If they are older kids,<br/>\nsay 17 or so...then it&#39;s less about the parents and more about the kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;d feel like I wasn&#39;t being honest if I didn&#39;t put this in this post so<br/>\nhere goes.  If your child has turned to self-injury and suicidal ideation<br/>\nover being snubbed by one kid/multiple kids but your child is unschooled and<br/>\nsupported in all other areas of their life, then you need to get your kid to<br/>\ncounseling because your child has WAY more going on that just this one<br/>\nsituation.  Sure, no one likes to be snubbed/bullied but since this isn&#39;t<br/>\nschool and your kid isn&#39;t exposed to this situation 8 hours a day 185 days a<br/>\nyear, it seems to me to be a VERY extreme reaction to an unpleasant<br/>\nsituation.  I&#39;M NOT SAYING YOUR KID HAS NO RIGHT TO BE UPSET!!  I&#39;m saying<br/>\nthat talking about killing yourself and cutting is way too severe a reaction<br/>\nfor the situation AS YOU DESCRIBE IT.  (And if these are girls we are<br/>\ntalking about I&#39;d be sure to look at your child for signs of an eating<br/>\ndisorder or BDD because this reaction is just too strong if your child is<br/>\nmentally healthy and robust at all other times.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLET ME REPEAT...that doesn&#39;t mean that your kid shouldn&#39;t be upset.  That<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean that the kid that is doing this isn&#39;t a horrid human being.<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean that if her (I&#39;m assuming) parents know she&#39;s like this<br/>\nand they haven&#39;t done anything about it that they aren&#39;t complicit and also<br/>\nhorrible people.  (Yeah that statement will likely get me in trouble but I<br/>\nthink if as a parent you support RA/Bullying in your kid...you are a<br/>\nhorrible person.)  BUT I am saying that if your child has been pushed out of<br/>\ntheir primary social group but that group attendance was only say about 3%<br/>\nof your child&#39;s total yearly socializing time then trying to kill herself<br/>\nand cutting is a sign that there are other, perhaps much more severe<br/>\nmaladaptive behaviors in your child that you should be vigilant about<br/>\nattending to.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I&#39;d go straight to the parents of this precious darling and tell<br/>\nthem what&#39;s going on.  And to support my child I&#39;d show her that if there<br/>\nare ugly people about...MOVE.  Remove yourselves from the group.  Gather all<br/>\nthe other kids this has happened to and start your own gatherings.  BOOT the<br/>\nbully from the group.  If, as you say, there are a bunch of kids this has<br/>\nhappened to then there are a bunch of kids looking for their primary social<br/>\ngroup back.  Start it yourself.  AND if there are a bunch of other kids this<br/>\nhas happened to, then go as a group of parents and say to the bully&#39;s<br/>\nparents....&quot;Darling Jane here has taken to terrorizing all of our<br/>\nchildren.&quot;  If those parents, popular or not can look into the eyes of 8<br/>\nother families and see that everyone has had enough of this girl and her<br/>\nvenom, and they do nothing....then as I said it&#39;s time to start a new<br/>\ngroup.  However...if those other parents won&#39;t speak up...then they are also<br/>\nweak and complicit.  And they are willing to sacrifice their children to be<br/>\n&quot;popular&quot; with the &quot;popular&quot; parents.  And should you really be a party to a<br/>\ngroup like that?  I would think not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf these are girls I recommend a book called &quot;Queen Bees and Wannabes&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307454444/ref=sc_vs__Queen_2520bees\">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307454444/ref=sc_vs__Queen_2520bees</a> Also &quot;Odd Girl<br/>\nOut&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Odd-Girl-Out-Culture-Aggression/dp/0156027348/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_bAlso\">http://www.amazon.com/Odd-Girl-Out-Culture-Aggression/dp/0156027348/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_bAlso</a><br/>\n&quot;Queen Bee moms and Kingpin Dads&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Queen-Bee-Moms-Kingpin-Dads/dp/140008301X/ref=pd_sim_b_8And\">http://www.amazon.com/Queen-Bee-Moms-Kingpin-Dads/dp/140008301X/ref=pd_sim_b_8And</a><br/>\nfinally &quot;Mean Girls Grown Up&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mean-Girls-Grown-Afraid---Bees/dp/0470168757/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1289223057&sr=1-1\">http://www.amazon.com/Mean-Girls-Grown-Afraid---Bees/dp/0470168757/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1289223057&sr=1-1</a><br/>\nKaren<br/>\nFrom House, MD discussing parents of a child with Autism --<br/>\nDr Allison Cameron:Is it so wrong for them to want to have a normal child?<br/>\nIt&#39;s normal to want to be normal.<br/>\nHouse: Spoken like a true circle queen.
