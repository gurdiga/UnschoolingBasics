I put all the responses in a word document and printed them out <br/>\nto give to my husband.  He has questions about unschooling and many of you <br/>\nwrote such beautiful things I just had to share with him.  I have been <br/>\nworking on her room for 2 days now and it&#39;s going fine.  I just set a timer <br/>\nfor 15 minutes and keep telling myself that I am spending time with my <br/>\ndaughter, not trying to teach her anything.  It&#39;s been very nice.  Yesterday <br/>\nshe sat up in her bunk bed and gave me a news broadcast from stuffed amimal <br/>\nland and today she made up a song to sing and a dance to go with it to show <br/>\nher appreciation.  She has thanked me about 100 times and it&#39;s only been 2 <br/>\ndays.  She is so genuinely grateful it brings tears to my eyes.  I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure how to put it...she is thankful without the adult baggage...she is <br/>\nthankful in a way that shows that she does not expect me to clean up after <br/>\nher like a servant...ugghh, not easy to put into words.  I am also glad <br/>\nsomeone wrote in asking about learning responsibility....that was also one <br/>\nof my concerns.  I printed out all those responses as well.  I am planning <br/>\non giving Natalie a big huge room cleaning, but I think that will have to <br/>\nwait for a day when she is out doing something fun with Daddy, I&#39;m still <br/>\nworking to keep my cool for 15 minutes (grin). Thanks again for all the <br/>\nadvice.<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8318,"nextTopicId":8339}}
