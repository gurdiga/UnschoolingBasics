For my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-633021003\">My daughter is almost 2 ½ , and it seems that her friends who are not in<br/>\npreschool are enrolled in various classes, so I have tried a couple with<br/>\nher. For my daughters age and disposition we have only tried classes that I<br/>\ncan do with herfor instance a gymnastics class at the local Y where the<br/>\ntoddlers were working with their parent under a teachers guidance. Mayas<br/>\nfriend (not unschooled, though not in school) loves the class which is why<br/>\nwe decided to try that particular one outMaya had fun, but was not too into<br/>\nstanding in line or following group activitieskinda freaked the teacher<br/>\noutanyway, we were able to happily and successfully negotiate that class,<br/>\nbut I decided that it was not a great environment for her personality. I<br/>\nthink at such a young age (depending on the child of course) you should<br/>\nprobably be in the class with your child to monitor, observe, and help them<br/>\nnegotiate new situations (standing in line or choosing not to, ect) it can<br/>\nbe a nice activityif they seem to enjoy it. If not, maybe (for a dance<br/>\nclass for instance) you can find a friend who has a wall of mirrors in the<br/>\nhouse and wouldnt mind you guys dressing up in dance clothes and putting on<br/>\nsome music and dancing whenever the mood or desire for dance class<br/>\nentersMaya LOVES to dress up in something special and dance in front of a<br/>\nmirror where she can watch herself I guess Im trying to say that if you<br/>\ncant find the right class environment for your kids, you can creatively<br/>\nfacilitate their interests otherwise. Also, usually you can try out or<br/>\nobserve a class before paying for a whole session upfront.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, last summer I (regretfully) tortured Maya through survival<br/>\nfloating/swim classes where they would not let me be in the water with herI<br/>\nfinally convinced them to allow me to join her in the water (the classes<br/>\nwere free so I didnt feel like I had a bargaining chip to negotiate my<br/>\nterms better). She was not afraid of the water before, but is hesitant<br/>\nnowon the other hand she floats perfectlyand we live in Florida where<br/>\ndrowning is a statically huge risk for childrennone the less, I think I<br/>\ncould have DEFINITELY either passed up the free class (8 weeks daily) or<br/>\nadvocated MUCH BETTER for my child in the first placethe classes would have<br/>\ncost us 90 a week, a lot of money for us, but in retrospect I would PAY 90 a<br/>\nweek to not have her crying for those 15 minute daily classes. (on a side<br/>\nnote she later did fall in the bay, with me at her side, and swam to the<br/>\nsurface and floated as I jumped in to get her.i treaded water and screamed<br/>\nfor help to get out for about 10 minutes while she happily splashed beside<br/>\nme, not realizing the gravity of the situation) I guess the point of this<br/>\nlong-ish post is that there are a lot of ways to meet your childrens needs<br/>\nand interests if you do it creatively, and also in a class situation you<br/>\nhave to be very aware of properly advocating for your child<br/>\n<br/>\n-amanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39400,"nextTopicId":39376}}
