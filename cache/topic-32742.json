Arts and <br/>\ncrafts, too- my daughter likes best to teach things she knows. <br/>\nCooperative games, and other fun group games have been great- ideas <br/>\nbrought by kids and adults both. Also parents have brought lots of stuff <br/>\nsuch as large cardboard blocks, scooters(we have use of a gym and a <br/>\nplayground), those folding tent-like structures on wire frames that <br/>\nvelcro together, hula hoops, balls, etc, etc. which have been used in <br/>\ncreative group play. Having a dedicated space(office suite)that is all <br/>\nours all the time has helped SO much with mess issues, though noise is <br/>\nstill a concern as we share walls with other offices.

We have a similar  <br/>\nagreement for our usage of few facilities. We have a craft day,  <br/>\ncooking creations (wherein we make a snack and share), creative  <br/>\nmovement. What usually happens is that the adults set up everything  <br/>\nwhile the children play, and then the adults facilitate the children.  <br/>\nAbout half an hour before our time is up, we give the kids a ten  <br/>\nminute reminder to finish what they are doing, then they play while  <br/>\nthe adults clean up. The kids can help if they want, and some do.  <br/>\nKids can choose to be involved or not. we have a yahoo group, and  <br/>\nthere is a separate one for the kids (and all the kids have an  <br/>\naccount, even the toddlers. the parents help them, of course) and on  <br/>\nthat group we have polls about what kind of crafts and cooking they  <br/>\nwant to do, the kids voices count equally.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe yahoo group for kids was the best thing that&#39;s happened for our  <br/>\ngroup, because every child can post, even the two year olds have had  <br/>\ntheir parents send emails for them.
