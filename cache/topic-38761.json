I just wanted to make a comment about your neighbor. Don&#39;t let her get you into a panic. Her ignorance of your philosophy on life and learning should not get in the way of how you and your family are schooling your children. Your son will be fine. Just because this person has never heard of unschooling and it is so very different from the way these other homeschoolers she has supposedly spoken with approach learning in a more traditional method does not make your choice wrong nor are you endangering your son&#39;s chances of getting into college if he chooses to go that route. From the list of things you posted your son sounds like a &quot;well rounded&quot; individual (college speak for we want those types of students). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I sat in college lecture halls in 2001-2002 I had a fellow class mate who was 13 years younger than I was, she had been home schooled and started college at 15. She was accepted into the physician&#39;s assistant program at the school. Which is highly competitive and very intense. The last I heard she had graduated with honors and went on to become an excellent PA. She had never taken a test before college. She was also my calculus tutor. Thinking back that was probably the first time I had heard about unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nStand fast and know that it sounds as if you have made the right choice for you and your family. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for a portfolio it sounds as if you have started one with your post. I have been keeping my own personal records of what the kids have been doing, I live in SC as well. I also love to hold on to my kids projects. I think my refrigerator is white, I can&#39;t remember it is covered with works of art, short stories, poems and photographs. They get moved into shoe boxes that have a label with the list of contents. Eventually I will scan and make  digital scrapbook of everything. We have a shoe box full of envelopes labeled with any tickets/receipts from places we have gone to. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany colleges now have a spot on their application for home schoolers to check off and have adjusted their application process to make it easier for home schoolers to comply with their requests.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\nhttp://tammycurry. blogspot. com/<br/>\nhttp://crazy- homeschool- adventures. blogspot. com/<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n------------ --------- --------- ------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I want to focus on what he&#39;s &quot;doing&quot; rather than what &quot;should be&quot; done.<br/>\n<br/>\n- He&#39;s read tons of books on real estate and finances (no &quot;work&quot; to show for it though) from authors like George Carnegie, Robert T. Kiyosaki and Donald Trump.<br/>\n<br/>\n- He is avidly researching our family&#39;s ancestry<br/>\n<br/>\n- He has a virtual stock portfolio<br/>\n<br/>\n- He volunteers to help do work on the church of his best friend<br/>\n<br/>\n- He has been hired to do yard work for a friend<br/>\n<br/>\n- He volunteered at the library last summer<br/>\n<br/>\n- He plays video games<br/>\n<br/>\n- He&#39;s learned many things about the Navy <br/>\n<br/>\n- He occasionally does math books (that one is easy)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, do I need &quot;schooly&quot; language? If so, any advice on how to do that would be great. All I know is what report cards say and he really doesn&#39;t fit &quot;report card&quot; language in a lot of areas (science, no math grades, no grammar or language arts), that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is for &quot;just in case&quot; he proceeds with his plans to dual enroll when he is 16. Also, in case he runs into problems with no matter what he chooses to do, I&#39;d like to find a certified, unschool friendly teacher and be able to show what he has done.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, through the books he&#39;s read, he&#39;s learned history but it isn&#39;t the same as the &quot;school&quot; kids.

Most<br/>\ncolleges accept parental issued diplomas for homeschoolers - a &#39;diploma&#39;<br/>\nis simply a piece of paper indicating that a person has completed<br/>\nsomething.

There are several<br/>\nbooks out relating to preparing for college specifically for<br/>\nhomeschoolers. And there&#39;s a new yahoo group of teen/grown unschooled<br/>\nyoung people who answer these sorts of questions from their perspective<br/>\n- maybe track that down and ASK the young people who are preparing for<br/>\ncollege, in college, done with college how they handled these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

I&#39;ve actually never kept records because we&#39;re with a private school that doesn&#39;t require anything other than attendance. However, our oldest is 14 so I thought I&#39;d try to at least keep up a portfolio should he need one for anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you (or anyone) have any recommendations of how I can make one based on the following? I want to focus on what he&#39;s &quot;doing&quot; rather than what &quot;should be&quot; done.<br/>\n<br/>\n- He&#39;s read tons of books on real estate and finances (no &quot;work&quot; to show for it though) from authors like George Carnegie, Robert T. Kiyosaki and Donald Trump.<br/>\n<br/>\n- He is avidly researching our family&#39;s ancestry<br/>\n<br/>\n- He has a virtual stock portfolio<br/>\n<br/>\n- He volunteers to help do work on the church of his best friend<br/>\n<br/>\n- He has been hired to do yard work for a friend<br/>\n<br/>\n- He volunteered at the library last summer<br/>\n<br/>\n- He plays video games<br/>\n<br/>\n- He&#39;s learned many things about the Navy <br/>\n<br/>\n- He occasionally does math books (that one is easy)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, do I need &quot;schooly&quot; language? If so, any advice on how to do that would be great.
