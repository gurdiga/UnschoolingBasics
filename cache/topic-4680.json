She has broken 2 bones and had a very severe sprain in the last 3 years.  The most recent break was on a growth plate which could potentially disfigure her arm and hand.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFriends have been appalled that we continue to &quot;allow&quot; Adriane to compete in gymnastics...they feel we are neglecting her health.
