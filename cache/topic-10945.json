I got out of it for many reasons, but primarily, I was putting a lot of time and energy trying to being as loving and nurturing a teacher as the system would allow.  I worked hard to make learning as exciting as possible under the circumstances of school.  But I had to quit when I saw that others were not doing the same for my children.  The kids in my class would be happy, skipping along, no fear of missed recesses or any such thing, while MY children were being diminished in many subtle ways by other teachers.

My dilemma is when my children are grown, could I go back into the system and make school better for kids who will never get the chance to unschool.
