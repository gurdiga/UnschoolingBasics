Ren, you had a great idea re: letting each person have as much time as they want while reminding them that other people are waiting for a turn on the computer, while having interesting things going on for the others who are waiting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI considered giving each person a &quot;day&quot; when the computer is theirs when I&#39;m not using it...

I still had not gotten to a point where I figured out how to work things out so that everyone would have the time they want since we still don&#39;t have the other computer(s) we&#39;re hoping to get (and we still probably won&#39;t have enough computers, we&#39;ll still have to figure out how to share)... <br/>\n<br/>\nMy older son said that the youngest was going to turn out like Veruca, the little girl in Charlie & the Chocolate factory whose father gave her everything she wanted... and after he presented her with the golden ticket to go to the chocolate factory, she said &quot;Daddy. I want another pony&quot; or something like that... and later when she wants one of Willy Wonka&#39;s trained squirrels, the movie shows the squirrels deciding she is a bad nut, etc... <br/>\n<br/>\nI told him he won&#39;t turn out like Veruca! &lt;grin&gt; He just doesn&#39;t grok the concept of time yet...
