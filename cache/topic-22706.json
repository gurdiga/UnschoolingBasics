And,<br/>\nthey may choose to accept those beliefs, modify them some, go in a<br/>\ntotally different direction, whatever. Just as an omnivorous family may<br/>\nend up with some meat eaters and some vegetarians or vegans and a<br/>\nvegetarian family may end up with some omnivores. As the adults and<br/>\nkeepers of the money and car keys, you can readily limit what food items<br/>\ncome into the house. And, you can even to some extent regulate what your<br/>\noffspring eat when outside the house. But, at some point, your kids will<br/>\nbe making their own choices about what to eat and it may not be what you<br/>\nwould have chosen. We choose to have open communication about our<br/>\nbeliefs and choices, why we prefer to eat organic brown rice instead of<br/>\nUncle Ben&#39;s boiling bag rice or whatever. Sometimes I think the cashier<br/>\nat the market must think we&#39;re a little &#39;odd&#39; with a cart full of<br/>\norganic produce and half a dozen boxes of Pop Tarts and 3 lbs of hot<br/>\ndogs. lol Just as we trust DS with learning and with food choices, we<br/>\nhave to trust his choices in his beliefs as well - there WILL be a point<br/>\nwhen we have zero control of what he does. For now, yes, we could<br/>\nrequire it and force it, but in the long run, IMO, it&#39;ll work out better<br/>\nto start NOW giving him the freedom to explore and think and ponder and<br/>\nquestion. He may not end up with a choice we would have wanted, but<br/>\nthat&#39;s between him and God, we&#39;re here to try to help him make that<br/>\nconnection but it&#39;s not up to us to decide.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

And I would <br/>\nguess that anyone and everyone on this list is effected by their basic <br/>\nbeliefs. If I have a Christian worldview, I might consider the Bible as part <br/>\nof the basics. Or another religious book might equally effect my unschool if <br/>\nI have belief in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is a basic issue, if you have a belief system, it is probably <br/>\nthe foundation for you in your schooling choice. Or is it? So how do you <br/>\nshare your beliefs with your children and unschool? Or does unschooling <br/>\nimply that you don&#39;t set out to teach your children about your beliefs <br/>\nunless they desire that knowledge?<br/>\n<br/>\nI see this come up often on various unschool groups. If your a moderator, <br/>\ngoverning the group is expected at some level. Often people unknowingly <br/>\nassume that unschool equals no rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Summerhill school is part of my recent studies. This school allows <br/>\nnudity, profanity and cursing at any age, admittance is at about age 6-9. <br/>\nThe entire school is part of the government.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is almost a sense that an unschool group shouldn&#39;t have moderation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be curious to hear some responses to the questions above about <br/>\nbelief.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch Love,<br/>\nWildflower<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nIt�s tax season, make sure to follow these few simple tips <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Taxes/PreparationTips/PreparationTips.aspx?icid=HMMartagline\">http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Taxes/PreparationTips/PreparationTips.aspx?icid=HMMartagline</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22629,"nextTopicId":22762}}
