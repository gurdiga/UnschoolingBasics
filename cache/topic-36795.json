The big difference I saw between what I consider unschooling and what the Paskowitz&#39;s were doing is the choices.  According to the adult children, they could not choose a different lifestyle...or food...or anything.  It was their father&#39;s way or out of the family.  When they did leave, and chose different lifestyles, the father felt it was a personal attack and repudiation of his beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood movie, well directed, I did not see overt biases in it.

My daughter still can&#39;t get her head wrapped around how people treat each other <br/>\ndue to skin color or religion or country of origin... (neither can I completely to be honest).  <br/>\nShe didn&#39;t understand why the TV station didn&#39;t want to have &quot;negro day&quot; everyday when <br/>\nthey were the &quot;best singers and dancers in the group&quot;.  She wanted to know why Link was <br/>\nworried about going with his new friends on the bus to where they lived.  Explaining about <br/>\nbuses, and how people were treated due to skin color at that time (and unfortunately in <br/>\nsome places still today) and why marching on the radio station was such a frightening <br/>\nthing for Tracy&#39;s mom.  It all comes back to our perception and fears of other people. If <br/>\nyou are afraid of the unknown or misunderstood, you will take the same precautions or <br/>\nbehave in the same manner that has been an issue in our country for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not trying to pick on the person who wrote the above sentence, I just think that it has <br/>\nunexpected consequences when we toss around judgments in that way.

It was his way or the highway. Plus the sex stuff was very inappropriate in my opinion....as well as the tight quarters. I think they ALL turned out exceptionally bright and almost oddly successful and creative. I thought that there was definitely some ill feelings toward the dad (and the mom) which made me really sad. I am not sure how I feel about needing to be in society in order to fit in later to society. I Think when the kids said &quot;hey I want to do this...or that&quot; then the parents should have helped them achieve that. Instead, they continued to insist that they function as they saw fit. I think this is the problem in any household no matter if you are in the suburbs or in a van traveling the world.Kelli<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n EMAILING FOR THE GREATER GOODJoin me<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.comFrom\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.comFrom</a>: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:luvmy2gifts@...\">luvmy2gifts@...</a>: Mon, 27 Oct 2008 21:20:32 +0000Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Surfwise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you seen this movie?<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.surfwisefilm.com/(\">http://www.surfwisefilm.com/(</a>Rated R for language and nudity)<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Surfwise-Amazing-Odyssey-Paskowitz-Family/dp/B00180R040&quot;Paskowitz\">http://www.amazon.com/Surfwise-Amazing-Odyssey-Paskowitz-Family/dp/B00180R040&quot;Paskowitz</a> and his wife traveled anywhere on a whim for over a decade,surfing up and down the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of NorthAmerica, surfing, having lots of sex and making lots of babies.
