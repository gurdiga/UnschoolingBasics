But I can never remember when English rules corresponded with French rules and when they follow some other rationale. I remember feeling cheated when I realized that, despite years of spelling lessons, no-one had ever explained about all the various roots of English and how that affected spellings. It&#39;s the sort of thing that fascinates me, and has ever since I was a kid, but all I got was &quot;learn the rule and exceptions, memorize the list&quot; - and I&#39;d dutifully memorize the stuff, ace the test and imediately forget how to spell those very words. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does spelling things for them help them become good spellers? And <br/>\n&gt; since neither girl really enjoys reading books yet, how will spelling come <br/>\n&gt; along? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter has never had a spelling lesson and used invented spellings for years (she&#39;s 11). Now and then she&#39;d ask me to spell something - almost at random it seemed. Over the last year, she has discovered online friendships in a big way and all of a sudden she can spell as well or better than school and homeschool kids her age. She&#39;s a little sketchy on apostrophes and when to use them, but otherwise... wow. When did That happen? It&#39;s pretty amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s the one who likes graphic novels - she still doesn&#39;t have much interest in print-only books and rarely touches them, but she listens to audio books and lately she&#39;s been reading (and writing) for hours every day on fan-fiction sites. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I do believe that being able to spell correctly is an important tool in <br/>\n&gt; being an effective communicator as an adult<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not just as an adult! But context matters - the way people write in a quick-and-dirty text message isn&#39;t the same way people write stories, or reviews, or game walkthroughs, or invitations. People communicate So That they can be understood, and context is part of understanding. You don&#39;t expect a license plate to read like a brochure. One of the great disservices school does is it makes writing a mindless chore - no-one really cares what&#39;s in a 5th grade essay about anything, not the teacher who&#39;s going to grade a pile of them, and not the kids who write them. When Mo writes, it&#39;s real writing, not school writing: she&#39;s writing with the expectation that real people interested in the same topic are going to be reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Fun online games to learn letters/alphabet","postDate":"1361832641","msgId":49662,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNjE4MzI2NDEuOTg0NzIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwNC5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNjE4MjUxOTguOTYyNjYuWWFob29NYWlsUkNAd2ViMTgxMzA0Lm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGtnZ2MwZStyNWxjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MjIyNDIxMjMtOTcyOC00REUwLUEzMjAtQUE1NEJENEMzNzk0QHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8MTM2MTgyNTE5OC45NjI2Ni5ZYWhvb01haWxSQ0B3ZWIxODEzMDQubWFpbC5uZTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49661,"nextInTopic":49663,"prevInTime":49661,"nextInTime":49663,"topicId":49644,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son is 10 and a great speller.

My daughter could recognize letters for years but until her fingers knew where they were on the keyboard, that knowledge wasn&#39;t much help!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, maybe a typing program. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s loads of fun ones out there now. It could be he can learn the letters and where they are at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes he enjoy crafty things? You could make the letters out of cookie dough.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":171174582,"authorName":"lukesmama2003","from":"&quot;lukesmama2003&quot; &lt;karenandjoe2@...&gt;","profile":"lukesmama2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Fun online games to learn letters/alphabet","postDate":"1361805560","msgId":49644,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtnZnZkbytxNzBuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49645,"prevInTime":49643,"nextInTime":49645,"topicId":49644,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"First of all - it isn t me!

My 7 year old has mentioned several times that he doesn&#39;t know his letters and would like to.  We have always unschooled so there never been any curriculum or push to learn anything in particular.  He is very proficient at computer games and even knows some words, but doesn&#39;t read yet.  He asks me type for him a lot, which I do, but there are times  I am busy with his other brothers and try to give him the letters to type in.  That&#39;s when he says he doesn&#39;t know the letters so can&#39;t type them himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about playing some fun games to help with letter recognition and played around on star fall.com a bit this morning.  But it wasn&#39;t really that interesting for him and there was a lot of phonics stuff which I don&#39;t think is that helpful for *him* and what he is seeking right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions for fun ways to learn letters?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49624,"nextTopicId":49675}}
