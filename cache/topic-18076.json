In many of our opinions, unschooling (learning) unfolds best<br/>\nwhen children are given respect, autonomy (developmentally<br/>\nappropriate), lots of parental time and the ability to make their own<br/>\nlife choices (as they are capable).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not here to give anyone the recipe for unschooling. Each family<br/>\nhas to figure out what works for THEM. We can share how a more<br/>\nconsensual lifestyle has led to better relationships and better<br/>\nlearning moments, but how much of this is adopted will be up to<br/>\nindividual families. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t make sense in my world, to say &quot;I trust you to learn about<br/>\nmath and reading in your own time, but I don&#39;t trust you to learn<br/>\nabout household tasks in your own time&quot;...it&#39;s hypocritical to me. We<br/>\napply the philosophy of unschooling to our LIVES. Anything else feels<br/>\nstrange. But everyone will have a different comfort level and some<br/>\nfolks are just not going to believe it can (and does) work. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as disagreements, we have a lot of negotiation and discussion<br/>\nwhen needs conflict. Everyone does not get exactly what they want all<br/>\nthe time at every moment, but when the family is striving to balance<br/>\nall needs as important, they will get what they need/want in time.<br/>\nSometimes a need is not going to get met because the need is<br/>\ndestructive or harmful...so I DO step in as the parent and stop that<br/>\nactivity.
