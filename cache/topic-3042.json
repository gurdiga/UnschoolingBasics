Don&#39;t we all need <br/>\nsomeone to be more calm and kind when we&#39;re at our worst? I sure do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was feeling a bit of angst towards Markus tonight...he&#39;d been <br/>\nkinda grumpy at the kids last night over stupid stuff (while I was <br/>\nat work, which makes me even more frustrated with him). Today he was <br/>\nswamped with work stuff and pretty unavailable...the only times he <br/>\nsaid much was to complain about the messy house. ARgh.<br/>\nSo tonight, while he was working in his office, I slipped in and <br/>\ngave him a big hug and kiss and said &quot;I just want you to know I love <br/>\nyou and I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed but don&#39;t get bogged <br/>\ndown in it, this isn&#39;t your life and we love you.&quot;<br/>\nHe stopped and gave me a hug back, then a minute later he came out <br/>\nof his office, stopped me and said &quot;Thank you&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a really hard thing for me to do when I&#39;m not feeling in the <br/>\nwrong, but I&#39;ve found that the entire tone of the house can be <br/>\nchanged by one of us being willing to stop and say &quot;I love you&quot; or <br/>\ngive a hug. Powerful stuff really. And it pays off when I&#39;m feeling <br/>\nbitchy and PMS&#39;ing and he&#39;s the calm, sweet one.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] respectful partners","postDate":"1094595299","msgId":3046,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGNoa3FjOCtkNWo5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3042,"nextInTopic":3048,"prevInTime":3045,"nextInTime":3047,"topicId":3042,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Oh yeah - a real old lady - phooey!!
