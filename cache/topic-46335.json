Of course, it is possible to give something careful consideration and read all sorts of information supporting the ideas you want to believe and still be wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose it also rubs me the wrong way to be considered on the menu of out-of-the-mainstream choices. We&#39;ve been doing this so long and it has been going so well, it just doesn&#39;t feel like any sort of rebellion. And I don&#39;t have to fit into some category of vegetarian, alternative medicine, wanna-be hippie, ________ (fill in the blank with your favorite stereotype on the left) and rebel against everything else that&#39;s mainstream in order to unschool. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, in fact, we don&#39;t.

I have always enjoyed their uniqueness and parented to encourage their individuality. Having spent most of their education in a Monetessori we had a drastic change in finances and we placed them in the public school. Never being much of a believer in the public education we have been there for two years now but I have realized that it is not where my 12 year old belongs. He is very creative, think outside the box child and 6th grade in a traditional school has been rough. I am so excited about taking him out to homeschool him and terrified at the same time. Asking myself many questions like &quot;Am I making a awful mistake? What if it just doesn&#39;t work? what if he is not prepared for college? ect.&quot; But my heart is telling me that he needs out of the &quot;highly acclaimed&quot; public school. I have never been one to follow the crowd and am use to thinking independently about vaccines and a natural medecine but this is something that will effect my children&#39;s future forever. Can anyone offer words to of reassurance? Any reading suggestions are welcomed.
