Its so true.  I am having many ah ha moments  these days.  6 months through the deschooling process and I think my husband and I are just beginning to learn something.  I too have made more and more days just about the kids and have found them delightful and indeed have found how much energy I save doing so.  What is incredible to me is how much trusting is involved and the surprise to find that when I am directing and guiding I am not trusting.  I feel more involved with the adventure of parenting and less weary because of the work to be done.  I am wondering though what happens to all the years when lack of trust has forced us to make many parenting mistakes....what do our kids do with these errors....<br/>\n   <br/>\n  All in all it is an incredible journey so far.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Donna and Brian<br/>\n<br/>\nRen Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          ~~I made this trip all about him, and<br/>\nit felt great!
