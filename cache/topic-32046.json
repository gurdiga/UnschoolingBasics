For e.g. i started my day with 2 glasses of<br/>\nwater for 21 days (this was about a year ago).... and sure enough<br/>\nalthough its been so long... i&#39;m still reminded to drink water every<br/>\nmorning as i make my coffee pot ready. not that i always listen to my<br/>\nbrain. so as i really want to create a habit of stop and think before<br/>\nreacting (to messes or whatever)... then it takes consistent effort.<br/>\nand its paying off for sure :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOddly enough, 12 years of schooling doesn&#39;t form the &quot;habit&quot; of getting<br/>\nup early every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t want to live by &quot;habit.&quot; I want to make conscious choices<br/>\nevery single moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour water drinking isn&#39;t a &quot;habit.&quot; It&#39;s a choice.

Then I<br/>\nstopped myself and thought, bull****, I&#39;ll take whatever my children WANT to<br/>\ntake, and if it&#39;s goldfish crackers, so be it!  We&#39;ve got a whole group of<br/>\nvery good friends here who are way into nutrition, and some never, ever let<br/>\ntheir children have sugar in any form, things like that.
