It is about supporting<br/>\nmothers so that they are able to stay home to rasie their children instead<br/>\nof being forced to put them in daycare. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.change.org/ideas/view/support_for_mothers_and_children\">http://www.change.org/ideas/view/support_for_mothers_and_children</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(from Caren: just click the 56 vote on the left side of the page, and<br/>\nyou&#39;ll be prompted to register. When you get your confirmation, you&#39;ll<br/>\nneed to click to vote again, but it&#39;s quick and painless!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what her e-mail said:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The opportunity is urgent as now is the deadline (the 31st at<br/>\nmidnight):<br/>\nIf you would like to make your voice heard with the new president, please<br/>\nvote on my parenting recommendation and on my other posts at<br/>\nchange.org. You<br/>\nwill have to sign up but you will not get emails as a result of it and<br/>\nit is<br/>\neasy and quick. If we get enough votes by Wednesday midnight, it will be<br/>\nseen by Obama&#39;s management. It takes a couple of thousands votes so it<br/>\nwill<br/>\ntake a miracle to get enough votes since I just created it but there are<br/>\nmany thousands of us so it is possible. Feel free to pass it on.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.change.org/ideas/view/support_for_mothers_and_children\">http://www.change.org/ideas/view/support_for_mothers_and_children</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37502,"nextTopicId":37458}}
