That varies from state to state, so you&#39;d be better<br/>\nserved in asking on a FL local list, rather than an international list<br/>\nlike this one. Legally, unschooling IS homeschooling, so you&#39;d need to<br/>\ndo whatever is legally required in your state - each state&#39;s laws are<br/>\ndifferent, which you already know if you&#39;re homeschooling. I do know<br/>\nthat in FL there are a couple options to homeschooling laws - you can go<br/>\nthrough the local school district or you can use an umbrella. Umbrellas<br/>\nvary in what they require (and I&#39;d suggest checking them out to make<br/>\nsure the umbrella doesn&#39;t require MORE than the school district does).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne that is done, unschooling is like being on permanent vacation. Your<br/>\njob moves from being the driving force to being a partner and resource<br/>\nfor their exploration. You move from the driver&#39;s seat to the shot gun<br/>\nseat - they set the direction, you help them reach that goal (you&#39;ve got<br/>\nthe access to resources they don&#39;t have - car keys, checking account,<br/>\netc). it&#39;s a lot more like when they were toddlers, before school age,<br/>\nwhen you all explored the world together.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

Very similar to<br/>\nwhere you may be on your journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a treasure trove of unschooling resources on the web now.

It is my understanding that it really<br/>\nhelps if the parents deschool themselves as much as possible before leaping<br/>\nin with two feet :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of de-schooling most people recommend relaxing a lot when a kid<br/>\ncomes out of school. Giving them space to switch gears and heal from the<br/>\nexperience. This may take months or even years. A common way to describe<br/>\nthis is to treat it like a wonderful vacation. No agendas or pushing. Just<br/>\nhave fun and support whatever your child is into at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Dec 8, 2010 at 9:06 AM, Kevin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kirardy1@...\">kirardy1@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We currently homeschool our 6 and 7 year old daughters through FL K12.
