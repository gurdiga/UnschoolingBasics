She is 15 and <br/>\nfailing 9th grade in public school.  Technically she is my future <br/>\nstep-daughter, but I have been mom for eight years.  If I could have <br/>\nhad it my way I would have pulled her and her younger brother out <br/>\nyears ago, but we were very leary of bio-mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I am not in a position to be able to do a ton of research <br/>\nright now due to caring for my dying father.  What I would like to <br/>\ndo is put the ball in her court.  I have told her that I would back <br/>\nher 100% if she is serious about un/homeschooling.  This is a huge <br/>\nstep, and I know I wouldn&#39;t be able to be 100% unschoolish with her <br/>\nas I am with my son.  At least not right away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am thinking of doing is providing her with some books, <br/>\nfirstly THE TEENAGE LIBERATION HANDBOOK, and having her see if it&#39;s <br/>\nsomething she really could take seriously and would be interested in <br/>\npursuing.  I have also requested some other books from the library.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMore than likely she will have to finish out the school year.  Maybe <br/>\nnot, but I have a lot of convincing to do on the homefront.  This <br/>\nwill take time to make happen, if she so chooses to go that route.  <br/>\nWhat insight and wisdom can you all share?  What books would you <br/>\nrecommend?  What experiences are you willing to enlighten me with?  <br/>\nAnything that you can share from experience, thought or otherwise is <br/>\nmore than welcome.  In fact, I&#39;m begging...PLEASE SHARE YOUR IDEAS <br/>\nWITH ME!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks - Tina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4722,"nextTopicId":4730}}
