I&#39;ve seen the <br/>\nhurricane news and thought of you, tho I really don&#39;t know where Pensacola is. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely none.:)<br/>\nThe hurricane that is affecting our southern neighbors so severely, has made our lives more pleasant. It&#39;s pulled a cold front down, and we made a record low of 66 degrees last night. The high today was 83 degrees with LOW humidity...unheard of in mid-August. I just came home from work and it felt like OCTOBER out there. Totally awesome. I just wish it didn&#39;t come at such a high price for others. We&#39;ll get our turn eventually.....<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2757,"nextTopicId":2787}}
