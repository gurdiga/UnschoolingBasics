O&#39;Connell issued the following statement:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I have reviewed this case, and I want to assure parents that<br/>\nchose to home school that California Department of Education policy will not<br/>\nchange in any way as a result of this ruling. Parents still have the right<br/>\nto home school in our state.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Every child in our state has a legal right to get an education, and I want<br/>\nevery child to get an education that will prepare them for success in<br/>\ncollege and the world of work in the challenging global economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;As the head of California&#39;s public school system, I hope that every parent<br/>\nwould want to send their children to public school. However, traditional<br/>\npublic schools may not be the best fit for every student. Within the public<br/>\nschool system there are a range of options available. Students can take<br/>\nindependent study classes, attend a charter school, or participate in<br/>\nnon-classroom-based programs. But some parents choose to send their children<br/>\nto private schools or to home school, and I respect that right.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I admire the dedication of parents who commit to oversee their children&#39;s<br/>\neducation through home schooling. But, no matter what educational program a<br/>\nstudent participates in, it is critical that the program prepares them for<br/>\nfuture success in the global economy. I urge any parent who is considering<br/>\nor involved in home schooling their children to take advantage of resources<br/>\nand support available through their county or district offices of<br/>\neducation.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30803,"nextTopicId":30779}}
