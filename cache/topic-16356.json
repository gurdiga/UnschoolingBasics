Most towns have a 5 or 10 yr plan of what they intend as far as <br/>\ninfrastructure , attracting business, etc as well as things like how <br/>\nmuch property is required for a building lot - that is important since <br/>\nif there can be little 1/2 acre lots, you&#39;re more likely to get dense <br/>\ndevelopment than if, like the town we live in, building lots are <br/>\nrequired to be 2 acres minimum.
