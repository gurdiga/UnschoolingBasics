The mother&#39;s response to the crying was to keep trying to <br/>\nshove a pacifier into the baby&#39;s mouth and tell the baby to be quiet <br/>\ndespite the fact that baby kept spitting it back out.

In our neighborhood there<br/>\n&gt;is a handful of kids ranging in age from 4-6 who roam around playing<br/>\n&gt;with no adult supervision pretty much all day long. These kids are far<br/>\n&gt;from polite and have spent a lot of time in daycare or changing care<br/>\n&gt;situations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The difficulty for me is that my oldest (Sam, 5) sometimes asks to<br/>\n&gt;wander around with them. He is socially very easy going and is happy to<br/>\n&gt;play with just about anyone, be it a 2 or 8-year-old. I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt;comfortable with him being just anywhere within a two or three block<br/>\n&gt;area (this seems to be the range of these kids). And since I have<br/>\n&gt;Quinn, 2, I&#39;m not free to wander around with them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My boys and I spend a lot of time playing in our yard, sword fighting,<br/>\n&gt;reading, making mud pies, playing games, you name it. We also get out<br/>\n&gt;most days to play with little friends or have friends over. Our yard is<br/>\n&gt;really attractive to these kids (who live in a nearby apartment<br/>\n&gt;building with no green space).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I really don&#39;t want to end up with this particular group of kids in my<br/>\n&gt;yard all summer. A woman two doors down has ended up in that situation<br/>\n&gt;and she often seems to have five or six kids in her yard. She seems to<br/>\n&gt;be rarely outside with her five-year-old but I can hear her yelling at<br/>\n&gt;the kids in the yard occasionally or threatening to kick them all out<br/>\n&gt;of the yard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I feel kind of stuck. There are the in-between times when I&#39;m getting<br/>\n&gt;lunch ready or needing to make some phone calls and it&#39;s during these<br/>\n&gt;times that I&#39;m not available to play with Sam that if these kids go by<br/>\n&gt;he asks to join them. I&#39;ve always managed to suggest something else for<br/>\n&gt;us to do that interests him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is a new situation now that summer is here and everyone is outside<br/>\n&gt;all the time. What I really don&#39;t want is our yard turning into the<br/>\n&gt;local park with me supervising a group of difficult kids whose parents<br/>\n&gt;I have never even met. Or having Sam wandering around the neighborhood<br/>\n&gt;all summer and me not knowing exactly where he is. In another year or<br/>\n&gt;so I&#39;d probably be fine with this. But I don&#39;t have any confidence at<br/>\n&gt;this point that he&#39;d remember to tell me each time he changes location<br/>\n&gt;or that he would not go into someone else&#39;s home or apartment if<br/>\n&gt;invited (even if I had asked him not to, he&#39;s only five it&#39;s easy to<br/>\n&gt;forget when something looks interesting). He is great at crossing the<br/>\n&gt;street when he&#39;s alone but as soon as he is excited (with a group,<br/>\n&gt;following a cat or squirrel) he forgets to look for cars.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d love to hear if others have had similar situations and how you<br/>\n&gt;dealt with them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Warmly,<br/>\n&gt;Susan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNeed a break?

I think <br/>\nyour gut is telling you something important and it makes sense to <br/>\nlisten. <br/>\nIt is a really hard line to walk when allowing kids freedom to <br/>\nexplore and also keeping safety in mind.  I think it is easy to go <br/>\ntoo far in either direction.  Where we live my son has a hard time <br/>\nfinding kids his age to play with because almost none of them are <br/>\nallowed out of the yard to play, and since most of the families have <br/>\nboth parents working, when they are home they don&#39;t really want to <br/>\nget to know the neighbors, but instead have scheduled play/sports.  <br/>\nI finally started knocking on doors with play equipment and <br/>\nintroducing myself and my son to other parents hoping that if we <br/>\nclicked that we could exchange phone numbers and set <br/>\nup &quot;playdates&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also know what you mean about being the park, my neighbor across <br/>\nthe street has older children and her yard is always filled.  <br/>\nOverall she likes it that way and so would I, but at the same time <br/>\nshe does mention that between all the snacks, juice and accidentally <br/>\nbroken toys it can get expensive.  Plus there is the added <br/>\nresponsibility in always being &quot;on&quot; when it comes to making sure <br/>\neverything is going smoothly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like your yard is a great place to &quot;hang out&quot; and of <br/>\ncourse there is nothing wrong with telling the kids that today isn&#39;t <br/>\na good day or that you guys are busy but they can come back later.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA good way to meet the parents is that if they do come to your house <br/>\ninsist on calling the parents and making sure it is okay for them to <br/>\nbe over.  That way you can introduce yourself, ask how long before <br/>\nlittle &quot;Ricky&quot; should come home to check in, and get a feeling for <br/>\nthe parents.  You never know some of them might feel the same way <br/>\nyou do but just don&#39;t know what to do about it either. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;asmb65&quot; &lt;asmb65@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a situation that I&#39;d love comments on.

We have next door neighbors who are in <br/>\nday care/ ps all day.  They come to our house almost every day - <br/>\ncertainly every time they are home.  They want our home to be their <br/>\nhome.  But it is very hard for me when they are here.  They just <br/>\ndon&#39;t understand how to behave.  I guess they are so used to someone <br/>\nforcing strict rules on them or punishing them, that they don&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand the reasons behind the &quot;rules&quot; at home and at school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have had to make some peace about having them over because my son <br/>\nloves with a capital &quot;L&quot; this boy who is 7.  The biggest problem we <br/>\nhave had is about excursions into the neighborhood (neighbor kid on <br/>\nhis bike, my ds on his tricycle or scooter).  I have twin 2 yo, so <br/>\nit is difficult to scoop them up and follow.  I followed them as <br/>\nmany times as possible until I understood they follow the same <br/>\ngeneral paths.  They have even made up names for them. &quot;Mom, I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to Alabama,&quot; means they are riding down to the school <br/>\nplayground.  Now that I have given him the freedom to go, he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nfeel like he has to sneak or run off.  So he tells me every time.  <br/>\nSometimes he&#39;s going next door to play video games.  Other times he <br/>\nis going for a ride on his scooter.  I will wait 15 or 20 minutes.  <br/>\nIf they are not back yet, I&#39;ll load up the girls in their stroller <br/>\nand go meet him. They are never gone for long.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think your best bet is to get to know these kids better.  Find out <br/>\nwhere they live, who their parents are, if you can.  Be right there <br/>\nas much as you can - not in an invasive or obnoxious way.  But just <br/>\nbe there.  Kids this age still have some innocence and excitement <br/>\nabout ordinary things.  In a group, it may be hard to see because of <br/>\nthis sort or herd mentality.  Single one or two of them out and talk <br/>\nto them.  Answer their questions.  I would also be honest with your <br/>\nson if you don&#39;t want him to go with them.  And remind your son <br/>\nabout street safety.  We have talked about how our neighbor does <br/>\nsome stupid things in the street.  Sometimes he crosses without <br/>\nlooking and cars have to stop for him.  I ask my son not to cross <br/>\nthe street unless he has to to get somewhere - I mean not to cross, <br/>\nthen cross again and basically play in the street.  I&#39;ve noticed <br/>\nthat if I show trust in my ds, he is more willing to have some <br/>\nboundaries.  Not something that I impose arbitrarily, but something <br/>\nwe talk about first.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;outside influence&quot; of other kids has been such a challenge.  <br/>\nWhen it is just us, things run smoothly like our own little <br/>\nunpolluted ecosystem.  But I can&#39;t shelter my kids from the world.  <br/>\nThey are far more resilient than that anyway.  The truth is, it&#39;s <br/>\neasier and more peaceful for me.  So I tend to resist it.  They are <br/>\nlearning to socialize.  These are the people they will be running <br/>\nthe world with years from now.  These are their peers.  However, I <br/>\nwould ask them to leave if there is fighting or mean behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\nRachel (mom to Zane 8, Caleb almost 6, Greta and Carmen 2)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;asmb65&quot; &lt;asmb65@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a situation that I&#39;d love comments on.

In our neighborhood there <br/>\nis a handful of kids ranging in age from 4-6 who roam around playing <br/>\nwith no adult supervision pretty much all day long. These kids are far <br/>\nfrom polite and have spent a lot of time in daycare or changing care <br/>\nsituations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difficulty for me is that my oldest (Sam, 5) sometimes asks to <br/>\nwander around with them. He is socially very easy going and is happy to <br/>\nplay with just about anyone, be it a 2 or 8-year-old. I&#39;m not <br/>\ncomfortable with him being just anywhere within a two or three block <br/>\narea (this seems to be the range of these kids). And since I have <br/>\nQuinn, 2, I&#39;m not free to wander around with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys and I spend a lot of time playing in our yard, sword fighting, <br/>\nreading, making mud pies, playing games, you name it. We also get out <br/>\nmost days to play with little friends or have friends over. Our yard is <br/>\nreally attractive to these kids (who live in a nearby apartment <br/>\nbuilding with no green space).<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t want to end up with this particular group of kids in my <br/>\nyard all summer. A woman two doors down has ended up in that situation <br/>\nand she often seems to have five or six kids in her yard. She seems to <br/>\nbe rarely outside with her five-year-old but I can hear her yelling at <br/>\nthe kids in the yard occasionally or threatening to kick them all out <br/>\nof the yard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel kind of stuck. There are the in-between times when I&#39;m getting <br/>\nlunch ready or needing to make some phone calls and it&#39;s during these <br/>\ntimes that I&#39;m not available to play with Sam that if these kids go by <br/>\nhe asks to join them. I&#39;ve always managed to suggest something else for <br/>\nus to do that interests him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a new situation now that summer is here and everyone is outside <br/>\nall the time. What I really don&#39;t want is our yard turning into the <br/>\nlocal park with me supervising a group of difficult kids whose parents <br/>\nI have never even met. Or having Sam wandering around the neighborhood <br/>\nall summer and me not knowing exactly where he is. In another year or <br/>\nso I&#39;d probably be fine with this. But I don&#39;t have any confidence at <br/>\nthis point that he&#39;d remember to tell me each time he changes location <br/>\nor that he would not go into someone else&#39;s home or apartment if <br/>\ninvited (even if I had asked him not to, he&#39;s only five it&#39;s easy to <br/>\nforget when something looks interesting). He is great at crossing the <br/>\nstreet when he&#39;s alone but as soon as he is excited (with a group, <br/>\nfollowing a cat or squirrel) he forgets to look for cars.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to hear if others have had similar situations and how you <br/>\ndealt with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24686,"nextTopicId":24807}}
