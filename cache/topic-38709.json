I just got  <br/>\nthat in a newsletter.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings from Germany<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When I studied at NYU&#39;s Film School in the early 90&#39;s, there were  <br/>\nthings I really loved about it: detailed feedback from film literate  <br/>\nprofessors, hanging out with a few ambitious fellow film students,  <br/>\netc.. And things that bothered me: bureaucracy, EXTREMELY expensive  <br/>\ntuition, etc... And being a guy who had already made 50 short film  <br/>\nexperiments with friends before I turned 18, I knew there must be a  <br/>\nway to support the do-it-yourself path while still getting the fruits  <br/>\nof experienced filmmaker feedback and inspired camaraderie.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd after researching different models of on-line education programs,  <br/>\nI&#39;ve finally realized this dream of mine can come true by creating my  <br/>\nown On-Line Mentorship Program for Maverick Filmmakers.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn March 16, we&#39;re launching a 4-week Beta Session where students from  <br/>\nall over the world will be personally guided in creating 2 short film  <br/>\nexperiments, 1 larger short, or maybe even moving forward on a  <br/>\nfeature. Students can get support in: writing, producing, directing,  <br/>\nediting, and/or marketing their work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe connections will happen 4 times per week, on-line, via: web cam,  <br/>\nconference calls, and e-mail groups. Each student will be given in- <br/>\ndepth attention to set concrete personal goals - a process they can  <br/>\nturn into a habit, keeping them consistently productive the rest of  <br/>\ntheir lives. Every week, students will share work and receive  <br/>\ngracefully honest feedback . All this happens among a small number of  <br/>\ninspired peers - an electric group atmosphere that&#39;s both competitive  <br/>\nand genuinely friendly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody 16 years old and up with a burning desire to make or write  <br/>\nfilms is welcome to apply. They just need access to the web, the  <br/>\ningenuity to get their hands on a camera and editing software, and the  <br/>\ndrive to move to the next level of their career, no matter what.  For  <br/>\nthose who simply want to write films, they just need to be able to get  <br/>\non-line.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get more details, shoot us an e-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brooks@...\">Brooks@...</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, the Beta Session only costs $1! Before I charge premium  <br/>\nprices, I want to get a feel for how it&#39;s working, get feedback, and   <br/>\nthen fine tune it. So spread the word to the aspiring filmmakers you  <br/>\nknow because this program will get to their next level!  So spread the  <br/>\nword&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38531,"nextTopicId":38715}}
