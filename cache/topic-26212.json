Children (like adults) read if , and when, and <br/>\nwhat, and with whom, and as much as they want to.  But all the <br/>\nchildren know - it is not announced, just on of those things you find <br/>\nout by being in the school - that anytime they want, they can go to <br/>\nRasmus Hansen, a tall, deep voiced, slow speaking teacher (for many <br/>\nyears the head teacher of the school), and say, &quot;Will you read with <br/>\nme?&quot; and he will say, &quot;Yes.&quot;  The child picks something to read, goes <br/>\nwith Rasmus to a little nook, not a locked room but a cozy and <br/>\nprivate place, sits down right beside him and begins to read aloud.  <br/>\nRasmus does almost nothing.  From time to time he says softly, &quot;Ja, <br/>\nJa,&quot; implying &quot;That&#39;s right, keep going.&quot;  Unless he suspects the <br/>\nchild may be getting into a panic, he almost never points out or <br/>\ncorrects a mistake.  If asked for a word, he simply says what it is.  <br/>\nAfter a while, usually about twenty minutes or so, the child stops, <br/>\ncloses the book, gets up, and goes off to do something else.  One <br/>\ncould hardly call this teaching.  Yet, as it happens, Rasmus was <br/>\ntrained as a reading teacher.  He told me that it had taken him many <br/>\nyears to stop doing - one at a time - all the many things he had been <br/>\ntrained to do, and finally to learn that this tiny amount of moral <br/>\nsupport and help was all that children needed of him, and that <br/>\nanything more was of no help at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Rasmus how much of this &quot;help&quot; children seemed to need before <br/>\nthey felt ready to explore reading on their own.  He said that from <br/>\nhis records of theses reading sessions he had found that the longest <br/>\namount of time any of the children spent reading with him was about <br/>\nthirty hours, usually in sessions of twenty minutes to a half hour, <br/>\nspread out over a few months.  But, he added, many children spent <br/>\nmuch less time than that with him, and many others never read with <br/>\nhim at all.  I should add that almost all of the children went from <br/>\nthe Ny Lille Skole to the gymnasium, a high school far more difficult <br/>\nand demanding than all but a few secondary schools in the U.S.  <br/>\nHowever and whenever the children many have learned it, they were all <br/>\ngood readers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThirty hours.  I had met that figure before.  Years earlier, I had <br/>\nserved for a few weeks as a consultant to a reading program for adult <br/>\nilliterates in Cleveland, Ohio.  Most of the students were from <br/>\nthirty to fifty years old: most were poor; about half were black, <br/>\nhalf white; most had moved to Cleveland either from Appalachia or the <br/>\ndeep South.  There were three sessions, each lasting three weeks.  In <br/>\neach session, students went to classes for two hours a night five <br/>\nnights a week: that is thirty hours.  To teach the teachers used <br/>\nCaleb Gattegno&#39;s &quot;Words in Color,&quot; a very ingenious (I now think, too <br/>\ningenious) method.  Used well, it can be very effective.  But it <br/>\nmakes great demands on the teachers.  That is, it can be used very <br/>\nbadly.  Few of the volunteer teachers in the program had previously <br/>\nused &quot;Words in Color&quot;;  they themselves had been trained in an <br/>\nintensive course just before they began to teach the illiterates.  I <br/>\nobserved a good many of the teachers in one of the three sessions.  <br/>\nMost of them used the method fairly well, one or two very well, a few <br/>\nvery badly.  The students and classes themselves varied; some classes <br/>\nwere much more supportive, some students much more bold and vigorous <br/>\nthan others.  I don&#39;t know what, if any, follow-up studies of the <br/>\nprogram were ever made, or what the students did with their newfound <br/>\nskill.  My strong impression at the end of my three weeks was that <br/>\nmost of the students in the classes I had observed had learned enough <br/>\nabout reading in their thirty hours so that they could go on <br/>\nexploring and reading, and could become as skillful as they wanted to <br/>\nbe on their own.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this other bit:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Some years later I first heard of Paulo Freire, a Brazilian educator <br/>\nand reformer, who, until the army ran him out of the country, had <br/>\nbeen teaching reading and writing to illiterate adult peasants in the <br/>\nvery poorest villages.  One might say that his method was a kind of <br/>\npolitically radical, grown-up version of the method Sylvia Ashton-<br/>\nWarner described in her books &quot;Spinster and Teacher.&quot;  That is, he <br/>\nbegan by talking with these peasants about the conditions and <br/>\nproblems of their lives (this was what the army didn&#39;t like), and <br/>\nthen showed them how to write and read the words that came up most in <br/>\ntheir talk.  He too found that it took only about thirty hours of <br/>\nteaching before these wretchedly poor and previously demoralized <br/>\npeasants were able to go on exploring reading on there own.  Thirty <br/>\nhours.  One school week.  That is the true size of the task.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHolt doesn&#39;t say that after thirty hours everyone knew how to read, <br/>\nhe says they had enough information to explore reading on their own. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n(Typos and misspellings of quoted text are mine, dang it.)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Reading Research WAS Reading Question","postDate":"1190731425","msgId":26475,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOUNEOTk5QzI5MEE3QS0zNjgtNDExNEBGV00tTTA0LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwODM0QzkzLTIxRkMtNEI5Ri04NjMwLTY0NjRFQkU0QzE1Q0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDc1MzUwYTJjMDcwOTE1MDgyNnExOTRhZDA3NnU2NTM2OWY1MzIxNDM4NTczQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8ZmNndXRsKzdsb2dAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDw3NTM1MGEyYzA3MDkxNTEwMDdvMjVjMGZjOWJqODA4MTY3MTY4MDA3NzZiZUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDEwODM0QzkzLTIxRkMtNEI5Ri04NjMwLTY0NjRFQkU0QzE1Q0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":26233,"nextInTopic":26481,"prevInTime":26474,"nextInTime":26476,"topicId":26212,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
