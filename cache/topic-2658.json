I understand that they see - from the vantage <br/>\npoint of having done it - that it wasn&#39;t all they&#39;d expected. But, <br/>\nstill, as a parent, it has bothered me to hear Peter Kowalke, for <br/>\nexample, sound like he is persuading kids to not go to college. Peter <br/>\nis giving a talk at the HSC conference in Sacramento - here is his <br/>\nblurb:<br/>\nCollege Unschooling<br/>\n  - Peter Kowalke<br/>\n  Donâ€™t go to school just because you want or need a college education. <br/>\nUnschool your way through college! Peter Kowalke, a grown homeschooler <br/>\nwho has written extensively on the topic, discusses why college is not <br/>\nnecessary and explores several unschooler-friendly alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\n******<br/>\n<br/>\nNow - don&#39;t get me wrong - I AGREE with him about alternatives being <br/>\npossible. But he is very influential among the slightly younger kids <br/>\nand I feel a little &quot;annoyed&quot; as a parent that kids I think are going <br/>\nto LOVE college are being influenced to be &quot;cool&quot; (not Peter&#39;s word - <br/>\njust my sense of things) - to think of themselves as more radical in <br/>\ntheir unschooling - to sort of make a point - and not go to college. If <br/>\ncollege isn&#39;t for them - then alternatives are awesome - I&#39;m a big <br/>\nproponent of not going to college just because it is expected, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t like to see someone create (even inadvertently) a &quot;culture&quot; <br/>\nwhere going to college is considered an affront to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":31945013,"authorName":"Joan Labbe & Salvatore Genovese","from":"&quot;Joan Labbe & Salvatore Genovese&quot; &lt;salgenovese@...&gt;","profile":"jrl01760","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Sudbury Valley School","postDate":"1092058859","msgId":2658,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEhJRVBLT09FRUlBSUJISFBKRUJQSUVGQUNQQUEuc2FsZ2Vub3Zlc2VAd29ybGRuZXQuYXR0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":""},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2728,"prevInTime":2657,"nextInTime":2659,"topicId":2658,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Interesting.

I&#39;ll have to read that one.  I know four families who send<br/>\ntheir kids there and I also get some insider feedback from a former staff<br/>\nmember there who currently unschools his family in the town where I live.<br/>\nHe and his wife&#39;s criticisms were that firstly, the school views unschoolers<br/>\nas &quot;overprotective&quot; which is pretty sad since so much of the &quot;child led<br/>\nlearning&quot; philosophy is the same.  Secondly that he left primarily because<br/>\nhe felt there was actually a &quot;culture of leisure&quot; encouraged there...that<br/>\nis, so many of the teachers had been driven so hard by parents in their<br/>\nyouth that they were really challenging older kids who asked to do or learn<br/>\nsomething with &quot;Prove your parents didn&#39;t put you up to this!&quot; and thereby<br/>\ndiscouraging them.  He felt there were lots of kids who might be choosing to<br/>\ndo other things, but they were making friendship bracelets all day instead<br/>\nbecause that is what was promoted as &quot;culturally acceptable&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitely a place with question marks, but not your standard school either.<br/>\nIt&#39;s the only school I know of where the kids go to town meeting, vote to<br/>\nmake their own &quot;rules&quot; to run the school by, and regularly play outside all<br/>\nday if they want in the treehouses the older kids built, or sit around and<br/>\nchat, or mingle with kids of all ages freely, etcetera.  They can bring<br/>\nmovies to watch or video games of any kind with equipment to play.  The<br/>\nsocial code they have there really encourages kids to take responsibility<br/>\nand care for each other.  Where at other schools, &quot;telling&quot; about an<br/>\nincident of one kid picking on another for example, is often viewed<br/>\nnegatively, at SVS if you witness such an event you are required to report<br/>\nit (again, not a rule handed down by adults, but one proposed and agreed to<br/>\nby everyone).  I&#39;ve heard really touching stories about how the kids help<br/>\neach other and care about each other there more than a more normal school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say that if one of my kids decided they wanted to check out<br/>\n&quot;school&quot;, I&#39;d include it as an option for them to explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan<br/>\n<br/>\n************************<br/>\n&quot;I would rather live in a world where my life is surrounded by mystery than<br/>\nlive in a world so small that my mind could comprehend it.&quot;  ...
