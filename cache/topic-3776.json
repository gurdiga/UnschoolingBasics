(Sometimes I envision<br/>\nexactly when and where he&#39;ll die, but that&#39;s veering off topic,<br/>\nslightly.&lt;BEG&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Dylan was younger the thought of us dying and leaving him really<br/>\nworried me but I worry less now.  He&#39;s almost thirteen and I think no<br/>\nmatter which relative he went to there isn&#39;t a body on the planet could<br/>\nmake this child go to school. &lt;g&gt;   I had originally thought about one of<br/>\nDavid&#39;s sisters but Dylan says he&#39;d be happier with my brother Joe and<br/>\nhis wife or with my sister and her husband.  They would also be willing<br/>\nand happy to take our assorted critters.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why I worried about David and I dying at the same time, we<br/>\nhad almost no time together when Dylan was younger and certainly no time<br/>\ntogether when Dylan wasn&#39;t with us.  What ever could have gotten us could<br/>\nhave gotten him too.   Honestly I&#39;m with Dylan all the time so if I were<br/>\nin some kind of accident he&#39;d be there too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it could be illness, but like Kelly said, unless it&#39;s an epidemic it<br/>\nseems unlikely David and I would both go at once.  Could be food<br/>\npoisoning I guess, the way I cook. &lt;g&gt;   It might be hair balls if I<br/>\ndon&#39;t vacuum soon. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that Dylan is older and knows his relatives better and can quiz them<br/>\nabout which presidential candidate they&#39;re supporting and whether they&#39;re<br/>\nin favor of eliminating voting age restrictions, &lt;g&gt; he has a better idea<br/>\nabout who he could get along with and what changes would be acceptable to<br/>\nhim.   So I think for those who are making the decision now, keep in mind<br/>\nit may change when your kids are older and decide for themselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was an emancipated minor and at that time I had to show proof of<br/>\nemployment and I don&#39;t remember what else.  I don&#39;t know how it is now or<br/>\nhow much it varies by state but for some teens emancipation might be a<br/>\nchoice.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196090915,"authorName":"J.

Even then, though, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think it&#39;s  possible to make their continued Unschooling legally <br/>\nbinding, is it? It&#39;s  pretty much necessary to have someone who&#39;s willing <br/>\nto comply with our  wishes just because they are our wishes. It just <br/>\nseems so necessary to me  to find a way to ensure that the kids wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nlose their entire lifestyle  in addition to losing a parent--and I know <br/>\ntwo local homeschooling  families who have faced this exact dilemma.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither dh nor I have a  will, so it probably wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea to <br/>\nhave wills drawn up, and  I&#39;d like to be able to do it with this specific <br/>\nissue in mind. Any  ideas?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWell, FIRST of all, get a will! Ours is in our wills. Otherwise, our  parents <br/>\nand siblings would be fighting over the boys----and I don&#39;t want *any*  of <br/>\nthem to &#39;win&#39;!<br/>\n <br/>\nIf I were to die, -----well, the boys are old enough now, at eight and 16  to <br/>\ncarry on themselves with unschooling. I mean, Cameron could watch over Duncan <br/>\n while Ben worked----but at eight, he&#39;s right self-sufficient already. We&#39;ve <br/>\nhad  two au pairs, and we&#39;re comfortable with au pairs, so I think Ben would <br/>\nconsider  that if he felt Duncan needed daily supervision. We would also call <br/>\nher a  &quot;governess&quot; which should appeal to the powers that be. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nLosing Ben, I would sell the house and buy something much smaller. Again,  <br/>\nthe boys are old enough that I could work full-time if I needed to. (Or...  I <br/>\nwould go off to some fat farm, lose 40 pounds, buy a new wardrobe, start  <br/>\nhanging out at Saratoga, and marry me some rich horseman---at least that&#39;s  what I <br/>\ntell Ben! &lt;bwg&gt; )  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we were to both kick the bucket, the plan is that----before Cam is 18,  <br/>\nthe house would be sold, and the boys would go to live with Patrick and Gillian. <br/>\n After he&#39;s 18, the house is his to do with as he sees fit. Patrick & Gillian <br/>\n are still available for advice and such, but Cameron would make the  <br/>\ndecisions.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf Ben, Cam, and I all croak, Duncan goes to live with Patrick &  Gillian <br/>\nuntil he&#39;s ready to be on his own.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;re getting awfully close to the magic *18*, so our worries are slowly  <br/>\ncoming to an end. But the worry was very real only a few years ago.  Real enough <br/>\nthat we made these contingencies and put them in our wills. If I had  smallish <br/>\nchildren, I&#39;d be spending a few hours with good friends and another one  or <br/>\ntwo with an attorney.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3849,"nextTopicId":3867}}
