They try to make sure its happening from a place of connection  <br/>\n(so in the article you sent the family spent the day together before  <br/>\nthe limit was imposed), but still see it as an externally imposed event.<br/>\n<br/>\naletha solther in my opinion goes further along this path � she  <br/>\nencourages the practice of holding young children and allowing them  <br/>\nto cry in your arms (from memory up to the age of 6 but im not sure).  <br/>\nTo her credit Paddy Wifler tends to focus more on playful releases  <br/>\nbut still the idea of limits persists with both.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile not everyone agrees with &quot;holding&quot;... the idea of limits to  <br/>\nencourage releasing seems to be extremely common even in  <br/>\n&quot;alternative&quot;  circles.<br/>\n<br/>\ni really disagree with the limit/ release thing and had a similar  <br/>\nreaction to you about that article.... but that saidive found both  <br/>\nPaddy Wifler & Aletha Solther&#39;s stuff to be very useful. Their value  <br/>\nis particularly in identifying the value of expressing emotions and  <br/>\nironically both have quite a lot of unschooling themes in their  <br/>\nwriting (for example solther was one of the first writers i read who  <br/>\nargued that babies can regulate their own food and should be given  <br/>\nchoice to graze etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you read the stuff knowing you are not going to agree with chunks  <br/>\nof it but looking for the useful gems then the hand in hand site is  <br/>\nstill quite interesting.

I posted one below that made me cringe.  <br/>\n(Tried to find just a link, but couldn&#39;t.  So sorry for the long <br/>\npost.)  I can&#39;t believe anyone really thinks they are doing good for <br/>\ntheir child when they intentionally cause their child to suffer <br/>\nemotionally, cry and lose trust.  (Thank goodness for lists like <br/>\nthis one that promote empowerment, trust, acceptance, and <br/>\nrespectfulness for all family members!)    <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yesterday I saw for the first time ever the first part of Nanny <br/>\n911...I was totally shocked, shocked!! by how the Nanny wants <br/>\nparents to treat their kids!  My almost three year old said, &quot;The <br/>\nNanny is stupid!&quot;  We were all so upset at how the kids were being <br/>\nforced in their rooms to go to sleep and how the Nanny sat in the <br/>\ndoorway and blocked the poor child of about 2 or 3 yrs from <br/>\nfollowing the father while she was having a meltdown!  The worst <br/>\npart (aside from what it did to the child and family) is that people <br/>\nwatching might actually think this is how they &quot;should&quot; be treating <br/>\ntheir kids.  I wish compassionate, respectful and nurturing people <br/>\nwould be able to promote a healthier lifestyle for these families <br/>\ninstead!  Hey, maybe someday unschoolers will have a tv show!  Laurie<br/>\n<br/>\nPARENTING TIP <br/>\nPutting Limits on Fear<br/>\n <br/>\nI had about had it with not being able to go to the bathroom alone. <br/>\nMy normally independent and self-directed daughter was going through <br/>\na fearful stage where she would literally scream if she discovered <br/>\nshe was alone in a room, even if she could hear you right in the <br/>\nnext one. If she had to go to the bathroom, she wanted you to come <br/>\nwith her.  If she needed a toy from upstairs, she would insist she <br/>\ncould not possibly get it without adult company. I was sorry she was <br/>\nscared, but I wanted to find a way to encourage her back into living <br/>\nher life without her Mommy-as-security-blanket.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo one Sunday my husband and I spent the whole day with my daughter. <br/>\nWe took her out for the day with some of her friends and then the <br/>\nthree of us had a quiet dinner together at home.  When we were <br/>\ncleaning up the kitchen after our dinner, I asked my daughter to run <br/>\nupstairs and get the breakfast tray she had left at the foot of my <br/>\nbed that morning.  She refused, saying she was too frightened.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI took a deep breath.  It had been a really good day.  I thought <br/>\nmaybe it was time for us both to face this fear head on.  Setting <br/>\nlimits isn&#39;t my favorite part of parenting.  I&#39;m not always certain <br/>\nabout when to nurture and when to foster independence, what is an <br/>\nappropriate challenge and what is asking too much of my child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bent down and looked at my daughter. Then, softly but with <br/>\ncertainty, I told her that I knew she could do it and that I would <br/>\nstand downstairs, where I could see her go down the hall because <br/>\nthere&#39;s a balcony.  I reminded her that she was safe.  She began to <br/>\ncry and rant that she couldn&#39;t get the breakfast tray and she would <br/>\nnot get the tray.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was in a good place after a nice day together with my daughter and <br/>\nher stepdad, so I decided to hold the limit and let the feelings <br/>\ncome.  I touched her shoulder and softly told her I could see that <br/>\nshe was afraid but that I knew she could do it and I would watch <br/>\nfrom downstairs.  She insisted she would die of fright.  I told her <br/>\nthat I could see she was so scared it felt like she might die, but <br/>\nthat she could do it. We went back and forth like that for 45 <br/>\nminutes which built into shaking and crying and at one point she <br/>\neven screamed for &quot;Help!&quot; over and over.  I don&#39;t know where it came <br/>\nfrom but there was certainly a big pile of terror packed into that <br/>\nlittle girl. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut she eventually did it! When she finally made it down the hall <br/>\nand got the breakfast tray, she threw the tray as hard as she could <br/>\ndown the stairs, still crying heartily.  I gave it back to her.  She <br/>\nthrew it two or three more times before carrying it down into the <br/>\nkitchen.  Downstairs she let me hold her while she cried the rest of <br/>\nthe available fears out.  &quot;You did it,&quot; I reminded her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she sat up, got herself a glass of milk and said, &quot;I&#39;m going to <br/>\nwatch a show before bed.&quot;  Her stepdad and I stared at one another a <br/>\nbit shaken from all the emotion.  But she just walked off, into <br/>\nanother room, all by herself, without a backwards glance!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI felt so glad she could trust me with that big chunk of terror.  If <br/>\nI had rushed in to rescue her, comforted her, told her I would go <br/>\nwith her to get the tray, she wouldn&#39;t have been able to let the <br/>\nfeelings out and all that nasty stuff would still be stuck inside <br/>\nher festering.  This way is loud, shaky and messy, and I know I&#39;m <br/>\nnot helping her perfectly, but at least I know that we can both <br/>\nsurvive whatever it is she may need to feel and still be able to <br/>\nmove forward with both our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Juli Idleman</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32040,"nextTopicId":32165}}
