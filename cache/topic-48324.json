I am in the same room with Sam when he is raiding (although I am usually in bed earlier than him on raid nights).  I haven&#39;t played myself though.  This week I was around when Sam and another officer were interviewing a potential candidate for their guild - holy smokes, it was awesome - not sure how to explain it, but I certainly couldn&#39;t run an interview so well - so relaxed (I&#39;m a little on the nervous side in these situations), smart questions, polite....<br/>\n<br/>\nI have watched the Jane McGonigal Ted Talk&#39;s.  She&#39;s cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, lately, I am really realizing what a great group he has on-line.  They really seem to respect each other and have &quot;so&quot; much fun together!  I need to find some of this for myself!  But right now I need to split my time between my work and being available for Sam and doing what I can around home to make it a great place to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reinforcing all of the positives of WoW, gaming.

I currently work in an upholstery shop with a lady who really does spend most of her life upholstering and loves it. My partner&#39;s mom spends most of her time on the computer, as a graphic designer, even now that she&#39;s technically retired - she just can&#39;t get enough!<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Joyce&#39;s advice about planning outings - we&#39;re homebodies at my house, so now and then it helps me to remember to get the family out to do something fun. I&#39;m noticing a lot of anime and comic conventions this time of year, so look for one in your area, maybe - that could be fun for your son - or look for events or shows or shops related to things he does online. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Life on the computer","postDate":"1334059684","msgId":48325,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM4MjYyNUY4LUZBMzItNENCNS1CMTFFLTI3MkZENDFERDBDOEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGptMDhhcithaXQyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGptMDhhcithaXQyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48324,"nextInTopic":48328,"prevInTime":48324,"nextInTime":48326,"topicId":48324,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He is awesome.  But we (myself and my husband) get a little nervous sometimes about the fact that he has spent probably 90% of his time for the last few years on the computer with on-line friends, playing role-playing games or just talking He is very mature/serious.  He is now an officer of his WoW guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little background: We live in an area with no kids around, we aren&#39;t terribly social lately  no friends/families coming over here much lately, although we live with my parents.  I work 50% from home (on the computer) and 50% out.  I try to match my work from home time with his evening/night &quot;raid&quot; schedule, and try to be around and available to do other things with him if he is interested and try to find things that I think might be of interest to him.  But there isn&#39;t much that he is into lately.  We do support his computer interests  talk about what he&#39;s doing all the time, take him to the computer store  when he needs upgrades.  And we are &quot;side by side&quot; most of the time  our computers/desks are in the same room.  He likes to stay physically connected.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe homeschooled for 3 or 4 years prior and when we discovered unschooling, I was quite busy with my work from home and don&#39;t think that I made a big enough effort to find/offer interesting things to do.  I suspect that much his time on the computer then was filling a need  kind of a survival thing  not much else to do while mom was working.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur unschooling is a work in progress  I try to balance out everyone&#39;s needs; my husband is supportive, but hesitant, perhaps 70% on-board with unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of me thinks I should be working harder to make our home more interesting, and then part of me thinks I should just step back and trust that he is doing what he needs to be doing right now and not try so hard.  Sometimes I feel that when I keep offering other things to him, that I am suggesting that I am not o.k. with what he &quot;is&quot; currently doing, and I don&#39;t want to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts/advice is welcome.  Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48286,"nextTopicId":48345}}
