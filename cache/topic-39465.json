However, it is another thing to have seen war, to have lost people, or to have grown up in generations traumatised and devastated by it. 20 million Russians died in WWII alone - add to that the burnt villages and the starved during the Swedish or Napoleonic invasions, WWI, or the Tatar Mongol visits!

I am<br/>\ndoing my best to listen and support him. I speak honestly to him about my<br/>\ntendency to be judgmental. I&#39;ve told him that we need to take a break from<br/>\ntalking about it when I feel myself getting too full on the subject. I have<br/>\nfound some folks who know more about war than I do to talk to him (grandpas<br/>\nwho were in the war or in the navy, another home-schooling mom with a family<br/>\nhistory of armed forces) I am going to take him to visit an army base and<br/>\nmeet airforce guys. He says, &quot;I believe in war that is fought on open grassy<br/>\nfields.&quot; I say, &quot;War happens in communities and families get hurt.&quot; I try my<br/>\nbest not to inflict him with my opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\n***It sounds like you are trying to support his interest.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWould love to hear from you about how you support your child as he/she<br/>\nexplores something that you are firmly against.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I think that first I would try to examine my huge block against it. I<br/>\nmight ask myself why I am so closed. I had a similar circumstance when my<br/>\nraised vegetarian daughter decided to eat meat. I really had to stretch<br/>\n(STRETCH) massive metal yoga. It took a while. I faked it till I made it. I<br/>\nam sure she saw through my original guise but she knew I was trying. I even<br/>\nended up raising chicken for her :-) We butchered one...but that&#39;s another<br/>\nstory.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I am doing my best to wait through the TV obsession. I used to be a<br/>\nstrict limiter of TV. Now, there is no limit. Sweet son is sleeping until<br/>\n1pm and watching TV all day until 3 or 4 am. I miss him during the day. He<br/>\nplays with legos in the TV room. And, enjoys being naked and laying on the<br/>\nsofa with his dog, watching TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I would hesitate to use the word obsession, how about passion. It sounds<br/>\nnicer and less condescending. You can tell him you miss hanging out with him<br/>\nand offer options of things he may be interested in doing. But if TV was a<br/>\nhot commodity he may need time to reconnect fully with it. Can you sit with<br/>\nhim? Can you talk about his favorite shows? Bring him snacks and drinks?<br/>\nFind him cool thing that go along with his favorite programs? get a dvr (or<br/>\nsomething similar) so he can record his faves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my dd went through a TV passion I would try to watch as much as I could<br/>\nwith her. I would bring things to her. I even watched parts of shows (before<br/>\ndvr) so she could run to the bathroom without missing a second (maybe I<br/>\nshould have gotten a poyty chair {g}) we would get clothing items and books<br/>\nthat pertained to the shows or were interests sparked by the shows. She<br/>\nbecame passionate about mythology from Xena. So we did everything mythology<br/>\n(from Egypt to christianity). We lived TV with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuy loads of legos! Play legos!<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to be out and about once in a while, especially as east coast<br/>\nweather gets warmer. And, so would his big sister (11 years).<br/>\n<br/>\n***If you really need to get out get a baby sitter. Or consider leaving him<br/>\nhome. I have no idea how responsible your son is, but I started to leave my<br/>\noldest home alone for very short periods around that age. we started out for<br/>\njust a few minutes while I ran to the library (a 10 minute walk) and then<br/>\nprigressed to staying home while I did groceries. About 30-45 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do things that he loves he might come. Getting a recording devise<br/>\nwill really help as well.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==--==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==--<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanna hear from you... in a similar situation, how long until your<br/>\nkiddos felt full from TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I have a lot of great essays and stories on my blog.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/2008/10/tv.html\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/2008/10/tv.html</a><br/>\nhere is one specific about TV<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: need some emotional support","postDate":"1239661901","msgId":39485,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdzMGVnZCszN212QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdydjV0dSs3MGlrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39466,"nextInTopic":39486,"prevInTime":39484,"nextInTime":39486,"topicId":39465,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ********************** Its one of the ways kids explore ethics - they get all wrapped up in ideas of us-vs-them, good-vs-evil and need to play and think","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1235858339\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;sistergoddesselli&quot; &lt;elinorsparks@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I am a pacifist and my 8-year-old son has experienced an explosion in his passion for WAR - toys, video games, talk, daydreams - all about WAR.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nIts one of the ways kids explore ethics - they get all wrapped up in ideas of us-vs-them, good-vs-evil and need to play and think and read and watch movies about that. I grew up playing various &quot;war&quot; type games, even learned to shoot a gun as a kid, but I&#39;m a pacifist and have been since I was a teenager. I&#39;ve lived communnally and have some pretty good skills in the area of peaceful problem solving. My brother grew up in the same environment (he&#39;s just a year younger) and he&#39;s one of the gentlest men I know. There&#39;s No automatic progression of interest in war and fighting games to aggressive adult behavior. I Promise!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He says, &quot;I believe in war that is fought on open grassy fields.&quot;  I say, &quot;War happens in communities and families get hurt.&quot;  I try my best not to inflict him with my opinions.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile kids are exploring the various issues that underlie war and violence, they aren&#39;t necessarily ready to articulate that exploration in any way that makes sense to adults until the mid to late teens. Its a developmental thing. Work on listening to what he&#39;s saying and think about the ideas that he&#39;s pushing around in his mind, rather than offering too much adult-style discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would love to hear from you about how you support your child as he/she explores something that you are firmly against.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>************************<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Mo was little I went through some agonies over plastic toys. I wanted to fill her life with beautiful things, which at the time I defined as things that were handmade of natural materials. But she looooooved plastic toys. So I sat myself down and thought really hard about this idea of beauty - what did I really mean? And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I was defining &quot;beautiful&quot; as things that made me happy. It was an Aha moment for me - I had stumbled upon one of my guiding principles: Joy. Suddenly I had a whole new way to approach this dillema. Rather than asking &quot;is is beautiful?&quot; I could ask &quot;will this bring some joy?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are firmly against something, ask yourself what you are For, instead. What idea are you trying to cultivate? If its peace, think about that - what does it mean to be peaceful? My own peace depends entirely on myself - if I&#39;m trying to change the people around me, I&#39;m not at peace, I&#39;m fighting! But I can change myself. I can accept and cultivate joy and kindness. Amazingly, when I do that, my environment often becomes more peaceful, too. If nothing else, I&#39;m not adding my own drama to the mix ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And, I am doing my best to wait through the TV obsession. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It helped me to catch myself every time I thought or said or wrote &quot;obsession&quot; and change it to &quot;passion&quot; or &quot;love&quot; or &quot;enthusiasm&quot; or &quot;focus&quot;. There&#39;s a cultural phenomenon that children aren&#39;t supposed to be passionate - certainly not in any positive sense of the word. But they are! They are complete people, with passions of their own And That&#39;s A Good Thing. That idea is one of the most radical aspects of radical unschooling. It shocked me when I first came across it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;d love to be out and about once in a while, especially as east coast weather gets warmer.  And, so would his big sister (11 years).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************************<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you get a babysitter or mother&#39;s helper? You might find that if you are planning outtings without insisting he come all the time he starts being more interested. It may take awhile though, since he&#39;s recovering from limits. Alternately, can you get a portable dvd player or laptop so he can come along but still watch a movie/play a game if he wants?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just wanna hear from you... in a similar situation, how long until your kiddos felt full from TV.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************************<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can apply the deschooling formula... eight months of deschooling from tv limits might be what he needs. Now, obviously that&#39;s a guestimate, not a hard and fast, rule. Some kids need more time, some less. I think it took Ray a year to get &quot;full&quot; with computer games.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And, what did the transition back to doing other things outside of the house look like with your family? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*********************************<br/>\n<br/>\nSeasonal changes are most likely to bring on a spate of getting out of the house for both kids.

That being the case, be patient - this is a hard transition under the best of circumstances, and like all transitions you&#39;ll have periods in which it feels like it&#39;s going great, as well as periods in which you&#39;ll feel like pulling your hair (or someone else&#39;s) out by the roots. So remember to breathe and relax when you can, and trust that this is for the best and that all of the goodness may not be visible for some time. <br/>\n <br/>\nRegarding the war stuff, this has been a recurring theme for us. I grew up playing war, cowboys and Indians, cops and robbers, etc. My wife hates it. I served 8 years in the Army, and she served one year but hated every minute of it, I think. We have both since become pacifists, even joining some war protests and the like. For years, we prohibited fighting games and gun play for our two boys (now 10 and 7.) My wife still struggles with the overarching need of our boys to interact roughly and physically sometimes, and I sometimes wish it were different as well. But I do trust them to know when enough is enough, and I trust other kids to react strongly when my children do things that are out of line (which is actually pretty rare; they do self-regulate.)<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I was a kid, I enjoyed a very glorified view of what war was, with gallant charges in the face of enemy fire and long death monologues. Never once did I think about the realities of war - civilians starving to death, children mangled, disembowelments, etc - because that was beyond my ability to comprehend at the time. I did not play war for the violence of it, I played for the glory of it - heroically doing good and fighting the good fight, even if it lead to &quot;death.&quot; Now in retrospect, I realize that there is little (if any) &quot;glory&quot; in war, and I&#39;m actually not even sure what &quot;glory&quot; really means anymore.  As I grew older and was able to process more, I learned about the horrors and atrocities of war, and knew it was something that was not to be played at, but either avoided or practiced like a craft to be used only in the worst of circumstances. Either way, it was not something to be glorified.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBut I did learn a ton from those childhood fascinations. I learned about history, leadership, teamwork, brotherhood, living in the outdoors, the industrial revolution, first aid, and acting, to name just a few things. It was a way to explore the world, a vehicle through which to open many other doors, and a way to synthesize much of the information tucked away in different corners of my brain. It became, in some ways, a grand experiment of my imagination as I sorted out what was real and what was not. <br/>\n <br/>\nAt 8 years old, he is not really &quot;for war&quot;; he is &quot;for imagination&quot;, and is using war as a vehicle through which to explore. Are you not amazed at how much he&#39;s been able to learn, and focus, and enjoy, and expand? Think of your reaction if he had chosen a different vehicle through which to explore the world - music, or art, or Pokemon. Similar experiences, similar growth, but in a different vehicle, no? <br/>\n <br/>\nSo that brings me to the TV thing. I wish I could tell you that there is a strict time-table, but there is not - especially after just a few months! Again, TV is a vehicle that helps him learn, relax, or both - and learning and relaxing are good things! He won&#39;t watch it forever, but right now that is singing to him as it does for most new unschoolers. <br/>\n <br/>\nTry to be patient and recognize that your in the first steps of a journey that will provide you with a million opportunities to be amazed at your children, if you&#39;re able to breathe enough to enjoy the ride. <br/>\n <br/>\nJeff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Mon, 4/13/09, sistergoddesselli &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elinorsparks@...\">elinorsparks@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: sistergoddesselli &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elinorsparks@...\">elinorsparks@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] need some emotional support<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Monday, April 13, 2009, 3:59 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is the best thing yet!
