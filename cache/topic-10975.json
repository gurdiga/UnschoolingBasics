But imagine a child who hates school,<br/>\nfor any or all of the really good reasons there are to hate school, and<br/>\nthe child has no choice.  Can&#39;t stay home and do what he loves, can&#39;t<br/>\nhang out with mom, but has to go to a place he hates, with people he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like, and do things he doesn&#39;t care about.

Looking at *ourselves* is a good place to start.  It&#39;s<br/>\neasy in the sense that we have full, complete and constant access to our<br/>\nown brain and motivations.  We have a record of our past actions and if<br/>\nwe&#39;re willing to analyze you can correct our mistakes.  We don&#39;t get this<br/>\nkind of access to any other brain so starting within ourselves is the<br/>\nbest thing we can do.  It&#39;s difficult if that internal examination<br/>\nreveals things we&#39;d rather not know about ourselves but it&#39;s a good thing<br/>\nto do for our kids and for our journey closer to unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n***April 2005 saw an incident at school that brought us in the eyes of<br/>\nthe authorities. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you mean authorities as in the police?  <br/>\n<br/>\n***He is doing pretty great in light of no work for almost a year but it<br/>\nis taking my whole day and where is the joy of learning?

He asks me &quot;Mum, how does this<br/>\nlearn me?&quot; (Great grammar there, ha!) and I am buggered if I can<br/>\nanswer that.***<br/>\n<br/>\n***I am very very close to the unschool method but of course, the<br/>\nauthorities as such know about us... breaking the law.... so what?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think what you&#39;re doing is close to unschooling.   I&#39;m just<br/>\nputting this out there for you to do with what you will.  But there are<br/>\nhints in your writing  regarding what you&#39;ve been doing and how you&#39;re<br/>\nthinking on certain issues that reveal a lack of understanding of<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\nIf you think it&#39;s worth looking into there are lots of places to get<br/>\ninformation.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some writings on unschooling at the following links.  If you<br/>\nare working toward unschooling these writings may help. <br/>\nwww.sandradodd.com/unschooling<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info/articles.htm\">http://www.unschooling.info/articles.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy recommendation to you is read here and at the links provided.   Find<br/>\nan Australian unschooling list and join - they can give you ideas about<br/>\ndealing with authorities.

Stop doing &quot;school&quot; work with your son.  Instead, do things he<br/>\nloves to do.  Don&#39;t think about school.  Think about all the ways you can<br/>\nbring joy back into your son&#39;s life and then do that.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***He asks me &quot;Mum, how does this learn me?&quot; ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI like that! &lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s a good question.  How does it learn him to be<br/>\nmiserable and unhappy and stressed and worried and full of self doubt? <br/>\nVery good question.  You have a smart kid. <br/>\n<br/>\n***He is VERY obsessed with computer. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t use the word &quot;obsessed&quot; to describe his interest.  In the<br/>\nfirst place it&#39;s not a very respectful way to talk about someone&#39;s<br/>\npassion and second it implies the person with the interest is actually<br/>\nill.   It&#39;s an interest.   Support it and encourage it the way you hope<br/>\nyour friends will support and encourage your interest in beading.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***I have been looking hard at myself. I miss the me time to create my<br/>\nglass beads. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine that&#39;s similar to the way your son has felt, trapped in the<br/>\nschool system, no freedom to do what he loves or be the person he wants<br/>\nto be...<br/>\n<br/>\n***Am I considering this out of selfishness and laziness?***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not selfish or lazy to want a peaceful life of joy.   It seems to me<br/>\nit would be selfish and lazy to leave your unhappy son in the hands of<br/>\nthe others who&#39;ve orchestrated his misery.  You&#39;re considering the<br/>\nhappiness and emotional health of your family, which is what moms are<br/>\nsupposed to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***My options are so limited ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have a lot of options.  You get to decide which options you are<br/>\nwilling to live with.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***but then having my kids here all the time I<br/>\nthink of the long Xmas break and how relieved I am when they go back -<br/>\nthat last week or two is like cabin fever ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should change this even if you ultimately decide to leave your kids<br/>\nin school.  Your kids deserve a mother *delighted* to be with them.  <br/>\nIf circumstances keep you in the house make the house a joyful place to<br/>\nbe.   What do your kids love?  We&#39;ll help you with ideas about how to<br/>\naccommodate them. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it&#39;s hot is there a local pool you can go to, a lake, a river?   Can<br/>\nyou get their dad to help you get a pool for home?  We&#39;re lately having<br/>\nsummers with temperatures above a hundred degrees and the three foot<br/>\ndeep, eight foot pool we set up in the back yard (one of those inflatable<br/>\njobs with big squishy side walls) has been glorious fun for all of us.  <br/>\nWater gun fights, water balloon fights, sprinklers, all cooling fun<br/>\noutdoor activities for hot weather.   Maybe you have water conservation<br/>\nrestrictions so the sprinklers would be out but a trip to a campground on<br/>\na lake would be so worth the effort.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it cooler at night?   Stay up at night playing outside and sleep<br/>\nduring the hot day, watch movies, eat ice cream.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***For my own sanity I don&#39;t think I could handle Miss 6 but my<br/>\nvalues are opposed to my perceived personal limitations.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you can take encouragement from knowing that understanding the<br/>\nunschooling philosophy can help you be a person who feels really free to<br/>\nenjoy kids.  And will help your kids feel free to be people you will<br/>\nenjoy being around.   If an adversarial relationship exists between you<br/>\nand your kids, unschooling can help you repair it, quickly.   It will<br/>\ntake work on your part, a change in attitude and a real desire to live a<br/>\ndifferent kind of life with your kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nLots of women have gotten the message that they can&#39;t be really fulfilled<br/>\nwhen they&#39;re with their kids.  Not true.  Lots of moms get the message<br/>\nthat we&#39;re supposed to be driven nuts by our kids.  Not true.   How does<br/>\nthis learn you? &lt;g&gt;  Have you raised kids who are no fun to be around and<br/>\nwhy did you do that?  It&#39;s not a question you need to answer here but if<br/>\nyou think about it I believe you&#39;ll see your kids differently, and maybe<br/>\nsee ways you can be different (better) with your kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":218449772,"authorName":"zenmomma@comcast.net","from":"zenmomma@...","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] &quot;Mum, how does this learn me?&quot; Any Aussies here?

Unschooling really is so different from homeschooling with a structured curriculum. It&#39;s about living a joyful and interesting life and including your kids and their own interests and passions. The learning happens, just like you said you&#39;ve seen with your own son.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to read more about unschooling, try this site:  www.sandradodd.com/unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary, unschooling mom to Conor (16) and Casey (12)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>\n                            ~Ren Allen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":203677783,"authorName":"trektheory","from":"&quot;trektheory&quot; &lt;trektheory@...&gt;","profile":"trektheory","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: &quot;Mum, how does this learn me?&quot; Any Aussies here?

If he was reading ahead of <br/>\nage/grade level and now struggles -- that sounds like a red flag to <br/>\nme.  Are you using high-interest materials, things that he would find <br/>\ninteresting?  If you read the materials aloud to him, would he find <br/>\nthem interesting.  (Hey, I have a 14 yr old, and I still read some <br/>\nthings to him!)  I have a friend elsewhere who has talked about how <br/>\nvision therapy helped her son.  It wasn&#39;t the traditional glasses-<br/>\nneeding issues, nor dyslexia, but the vision therapy was a big help.  <br/>\nPerhaps someone else will be able to fill in the gaps there for you, <br/>\nsince I can&#39;t remember the specific type of opthomologist you need.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, to meet his needs, while still satisfying school officials who <br/>\nhave you in their radar, could you do some combination of <br/>\napproaches?  Define what you think they will need to see, discuss it <br/>\nwith your son (you might be surprised at what suggestions he comes up <br/>\nwith!), and give it a try.  Don&#39;t forget, there are some wonderful <br/>\nvideos to help with learning about history, science, all sorts of <br/>\nstuff.  Even literature -- find the movie, discuss it, maybe read the <br/>\nbook afterwards so he gains greater understanding of what the author <br/>\nwas doing, after already familiar with the story.  Or not, you need <br/>\nto evaluate what will work best for you two.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son is indeed Aspie, another good thing might be to work on <br/>\naffective skills -- things that will help him learn to &quot;read&quot; people <br/>\nand social situations.  Things that the average person picks up <br/>\nautomatically from observation, an aspergers kid needs to learn more <br/>\nformally.  From things I have heard, they WANT to understand, want to <br/>\ninteract, but just don&#39;t get it, on how to do that appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your 6 yr old -- if your ex wouldn&#39;t accept unschooling, would <br/>\nhe accept some other form of homeschooling?  The term may be off-<br/>\nputting to some, or many, and if you either call it child-directed or <br/>\ninterest-based learning, or eclectic homeschooling (that&#39;s what I do -<br/>\n- a mixed bag), perhaps you could figure out something palatable to <br/>\nhim, while saving her love of learning for her and you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck to you on your hsing journey.  (BTW, I&#39;ve got a &quot;high <br/>\nschooler&quot; and it isn&#39;t so bad!)<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Donni&quot; &lt;donni@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi there,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I did a search here for Australia, found one thread from 4 months<br/>\n&gt; ago... so thought I should post.
