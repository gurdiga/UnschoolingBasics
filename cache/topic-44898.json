How can I change my  <br/>\nkids so my (righter, more important) needs replace their needs?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat idea is so ingrained in people they don&#39;t even realize it&#39;s  <br/>\nthere. And that&#39;s the lens they see all problems through: The child is  <br/>\nwrong. How do I get him to change?<br/>\n<br/>\nRadical unschooling takes a totally different approach and sees the  <br/>\nchild has needs they&#39;re trying to meet. You can&#39;t make those needs go  <br/>\naway. Conventional parenting can sometimes succeed in squashing the  <br/>\ndesire to communicate a need so it *seems* like the need has gone  <br/>\naway. With enough punishment, a child knows not to ask. And some needs  <br/>\nare tied to age -- like the need to run in parking lots -- so over  <br/>\ntime when the child stops, it seems like conventional parenting  <br/>\ntechniques made the need go away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith respectful parenting, older kids, who have learned through loads  <br/>\nof experience that you *will* meet their needs when you can find safe  <br/>\nand respectful ways to do so, can be asked to wait. (Or, if you know  <br/>\nit will happen from experience, you can plan meeting the need into the  <br/>\nroutine (like going to the park before the store).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, bottom line, his actions, his inability to hold back his need, is  <br/>\nall communicating his inability to do so. He&#39;s too young. Better to  <br/>\nwait until he&#39;s older and *can* rein in his enthusiasm until it&#39;s safe  <br/>\nto do so. You probably won&#39;t be able to eliminate all trips through  <br/>\nparking lots and intersections with him, but the fewer you have the  <br/>\ncalmer life will be for *both* of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreat him as though he&#39;s doing the best he can with the tools,  <br/>\ndevelopment and understanding he has. Trust that he does want to hurt  <br/>\nhimself and others. But for now to do better he needs your help to do  <br/>\nthe better for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Pam Sorooshian says: &quot;Don&#39;t set your kids up to fail.&quot; If he can&#39;t  <br/>\ndo it, don&#39;t keep putting him in situations that you know he can&#39;t yet  <br/>\nhandle.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":29148328,"authorName":"t_guyonvarch","from":"&quot;t_guyonvarch&quot; &lt;titiskarweni@...&gt;","profile":"t_guyonvarch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Issues with 2 y/o","postDate":"1285981637","msgId":44911,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk4NjBrNSs0NHYwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk3djk2MytuNm5uQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44904,"nextInTopic":44912,"prevInTime":44910,"nextInTime":44912,"topicId":44898,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Agree with Meredith.

Since my son was 18 months, I never go shopping without my husband because otherwise I can&#39;t do shopping, only sticking to my son making sure he and other people are safe. Oh and we also only did shopping in the evening as it&#39;s much less busy. Now at 4.5 yr he starts to be able to stop himself when we tell him it&#39;s dangerous etc. though not every time as he often choose to activate his selective hearing.

I don&#39;t get to shop a much as I would like but I don&#39;t get stressed out and my 2 little ones can hang out at home and run in the yard. Even when I go out with another adult, it can be stressful because my 20 month old loves to run. My husband runs a lot of errands for me now.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a list of random things that I have tried or done:<br/>\n-Let the kids hold hands together with me close by. My younger ones don&#39;t seem to resist holding hands with big sister as much as they do me. 6 year old and 8 year old will be on the ends and the two little ones will be in the middle. <br/>\n-Make it into something silly. When we go out, we will do the family safety train where we all hold hands and make train noises. It looks funny when all 6 of us are chugging and beeping through a parking lot. <br/>\n-Sling or other baby carrier. A backpack can work really well to get through the more dangerous areas. My 20 month old will tolerate being worn for small bits of time so I try to wear her as much as she will allow. <br/>\n-Put the littlest one on my neck or back.<br/>\n-Stay close behind while she runs. <br/>\n-Make it into a game and enlist the help of the older ones. Our code word is &quot;runaway baby&quot;, which means that we all go on alert. The older kids will stand in her way so that I can get her.<br/>\n-Sometimes, my 20 month old gets picked up and we leave wherever we are because that is the nicest thing to do for me, her, and everyone else that is trying to shop. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I try all of the fun stuff and it doesn&#39;t work, then we leave. There is no point in endangering her or those around her. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Issues with 2 y/o","postDate":"1285765643","msgId":44902,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk3dmRtYitwbnUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk3dGtwNit2N3RsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44900,"nextInTopic":44904,"prevInTime":44901,"nextInTime":44903,"topicId":44898,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hold his hand.
