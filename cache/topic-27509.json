I have so many examples of  <br/>\nthis just from this past week, that I&#39;m giddy to share. Josh is a  <br/>\ntechnophile, and it is hard to support that while supporting a family  <br/>\nof nine. We&#39;ve gotten lucky, the local university often sells  <br/>\ncomputers and monitors for $35 to $40, so we have been able to pick  <br/>\nup several over the years. Josh has a computer, but really really  <br/>\nwants a laptop. We had just watched the Secret, and Josh turned to me  <br/>\nand said &quot;I&#39;m going to have a laptop by Christmas!&quot; I was thinking to  <br/>\nmyself, HOW?! But I didn&#39;t share that negativity with him...I just  <br/>\nlet it go through me. I tried to fret about the cost, the cheapest  <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen is $600, and there was no way we could do that while  <br/>\nmaintaining our debt free lifestyle. So I prayed about it, he&#39;s been  <br/>\nvisualizing it, and we just got a phone call from a waiver program  <br/>\nsaying that they&#39;ve decided to offer computers (desktop and laptop)  <br/>\non the program. We signed our agreement that we&#39;d like one, and ETA  <br/>\nis December 21st. Around the same time he decided that he wanted a  <br/>\nPDA. I just affirmed it, saying &quot;I don&#39;t know how that will happen,  <br/>\nthat will be GREAT!&quot; Just something to help keep him on track with  <br/>\nschedules and appointments, etc. Not just any PDA but a certain  <br/>\nmodel, with all the cables, connectors, and a keyboard. Lo and  <br/>\nbehold, Friday night my dad stops by with a box from my brother.  <br/>\nInside is TWO PDA&#39;s, with all the connectors, manuals, and software  <br/>\nto hook it up to his computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are things that the universe has just dropped in our laps, let  <br/>\nme share how Emily has worked on &quot;how can we make it happen?&quot; She  <br/>\nreally wanted a pair of heelies, and I told her that would be great,  <br/>\nbut I couldn&#39;t afford to buy them right now. So we tried to come up  <br/>\nwith some alternatives (ebay, knock-offs, etc) Well, one of her  <br/>\nfriend&#39;s dads overheard her saying that she was working on making  <br/>\nthat happen, and it just so happens that when he bought a pair for  <br/>\nhis daughter, he had bid on another and forgotten to cancel. So, he  <br/>\noffered to sell them to us for what he paid, plus shipping. She had  <br/>\nsome cash, sold her rollerblades, and negotiated with him to help  <br/>\npull his tomato cages off of his rather large veggie garden to work  <br/>\noff the rest. So she got a pair of heelies for $20 and three hours of  <br/>\nlabor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to share, that yes, cash can be tight, but there are so  <br/>\nmany options when you look at how you CAN do things, and be open to  <br/>\nletting the universe deliver.

The short term goal is to accept being  <br/>\nhuman and try to figure out how to make the next moment or next time  <br/>\ngo better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe long term goal is to treat our children with the respect we would  <br/>\nfellow human beings (even when they haven&#39;t figured out how to be  <br/>\nrespectful human beings yet!)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":208642734,"authorName":"asmb65","from":"&quot;asmb65&quot; &lt;asmb65@...&gt;","profile":"asmb65","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Video games","postDate":"1194152847","msgId":27533,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZnamsyZis0aG91QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEEzN0M4MjI5LTU1REYtNEMzQi05QUY5LTYzQzhGMDdCQTZCRkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":27532,"nextInTopic":27534,"prevInTime":27532,"nextInTime":27534,"topicId":27509,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My son <br/>\n(12yo) was a total addict when it came to video games. He spent every <br/>\nwaking moment that he could playing them, and nothing else would exist <br/>\nexcept as a deterrent to playing his beloved games. He came home from <br/>\nschool, plowed through his homework without taking a bit of it in, and <br/>\ndid whatever else was necessary to get to his games. I tried to limit <br/>\nhim as much as possible, but finally gave in realizing it was something <br/>\nthat was very important to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we decided to homeschool, and in the process found unschooling. I <br/>\nwrote here about it not long ago, and it hit me that his one ambition is <br/>\nbecoming a computer programmer and creating video games when he gets <br/>\nolder, and that is something that is deeply important to him, just like <br/>\nit was to me when I was growing up to stay up late at night learning to <br/>\ndraw (I&#39;m an artist professionally now). By limiting him on his video <br/>\ngames, I was keeping him from his one love.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him he was allowed to play them as much as he wanted to. If he <br/>\nwanted to stay up late at night he could, if it was important to him. I <br/>\neven told him I was wrong and related the story of my own youth when I <br/>\nwas fussed out by my mother for staying up all night on a school night <br/>\nbecause I was trying to learn how to draw horses. Then something amazing <br/>\nhappened...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son didn&#39;t seem to be as interested in playing his games anymore. He <br/>\nstill plays them, but not to the extent he did before. If he gets a new <br/>\ngame, he will play it for several days straight until he gets to a point <br/>\nwhere he burns out on it, or beats the game, but it isn&#39;t his whole <br/>\nfocus anymore. He has spent more time outside than ever before, has <br/>\nstarted using an anvil and scrap copper that my hubby brings in off the <br/>\njob (he&#39;s a plumber) and has started making jewelry (see the necklace he <br/>\nmade me! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://deschoolingcaleb.blogspot.com/\">http://deschoolingcaleb.blogspot.com/</a> ) and has become highly <br/>\ninterested in blacksmithing now. He also has taken a deep interest in <br/>\nmaking yeast bread with me, and is currently learning to sew.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, he may still spend as much time on the computer as he once <br/>\ndid once you take into account he is no longer spending hours upon hours <br/>\nin school and doing homework, but for the most part the addiction like <br/>\nbehavior is no longer there. He WANTS to do other things, learn other <br/>\nthings and explore areas he never really showed an interest in before. <br/>\nHe has (on his own) decided to stop watching as many cartoons and <br/>\nstarted watching other programs like Myth Busters, and Dirty Jobs and <br/>\nloves watching animal planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has shocked me with the things he has learned without my help at all. <br/>\nHe told me that pigeon poop can carry up to 60 different diseases, <br/>\nduring a conversation I was having with my daughter about birds. He <br/>\ncomes up with things I never thought he would pick up, but he has been <br/>\npicking things up and RETAINING the information! If he had been forced <br/>\nto remember those tidbits for a test in school, he would never have <br/>\nremembered it simply because he was so intent on getting to his games in <br/>\nthe little spare time he had.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t speak to every child out there, but my 12 year old son <br/>\ndefinitely has benefited from being allowed to play as many video games <br/>\nas he wanted and when he wanted. He did for a few weeks stay on WOW <br/>\npretty constantly, but now he has branched out and has explored many new <br/>\nthings that otherwise I NEVER could have forced him into in lieu of <br/>\nvideo games, he had to do that himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t have no hand in this of course, I helped him in every way I <br/>\ncould to be bale to explore things that interested him. He tried banging <br/>\nsome copper on an anvil and I went out and bought him some new tools and <br/>\nmade sure he had plenty of materials and encouragement. He took an <br/>\ninterest in baking breads and I looked up recipes and bought the <br/>\nnecessary supplies. He took an interest in sewing and I went out and got <br/>\na few patterns he liked and we are now working on sewing him some new <br/>\nclothes. I gave him the opportunities to do something other than video <br/>\ngames, but never forced or coerced him into doing something else, or <br/>\nforced him away from the video games at all. He did that all on his own!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still have great fun sometimes curling up and playing video games <br/>\ntogether, and he has started earning some money on his own to purchase <br/>\nsome of the games he really wants, but it didn&#39;t become an all inclusive <br/>\nthing once he had free rein, it took a back burner to learning other <br/>\nthings, and I have done all in my power to give him that opportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt works.

Is there anyone that has seen the end result of it?<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to be snarky, but... how can *you* controlling someone else teach<br/>\nthem *self*-control? I was &quot;disciplined&quot; as a child - meaning someone<br/>\nelse controlled my actions (around them, anyway) through coercion and<br/>\npunishment. I did *not* learn self-discipline. I learned distrust of<br/>\nand alienation from that parent. Perhaps most harmful, distrust of my<br/>\nown inner voice. It has taken years (and years and years) to regain<br/>\nthat. &quot;The end result&quot; of not limiting games, TV, etc. is that my kids<br/>\nare learning to listen to *their own* inner guidance about how much is<br/>\n&quot;too much&quot;. They are learning what *they* enjoy, not what I think they<br/>\nshould enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the end result, for me, is not that ultimately they&#39;ll watch or<br/>\nplay less. It used to be, before I really understood unschooling. (and<br/>\nwhen I still demonized TV) I used to think &quot;OK, if I &quot;let them&quot; watch<br/>\nall they want, eventually they&#39;ll tire of it and move on.&quot; Now, the<br/>\nphrase &quot;let them&quot; seems foreign to me, and I have the attitude of<br/>\nhoping what they&#39;re doing is bringing them joy, whether that&#39;s<br/>\nwatching TV, gaming, building a Lego city, or playing outdoors.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a bit difficult to explain how that shift occurred, but the word<br/>\n&quot;allowing&quot; comes to mind.

The 19 year old was never <br/>\nreally into gaming (but he watched a LOT of TV and played on the <br/>\ncomputer for hours & hours each day while deschooling!), but he&#39;s been <br/>\nimmersed in other things for extended times: Magic, skateboarding, <br/>\nfilming, drumming, cooking---to the exclusion of almost all other <br/>\nthings. That&#39;s the way he learns best---total immersion. It seems <br/>\nobsessive, but as son as he&#39;s mastered it to the point he&#39;s satisfied, <br/>\nhe moves on---but not without all the knowledge he&#39;s gained from each <br/>\nimmersion. Then he touches each in a cennected way with the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 11 year old is a BIG gamer. Unlimited. Some days, he&#39;s on the games <br/>\nthe entire day. It&#39;s what he loves. But because he *knows* he has <br/>\nunlimited access here, he&#39;s perfectly happy to do other things. Getting <br/>\nhim to help me or go out with me is easy because he knows I support his <br/>\npassion. Some of his schooled/limited friends refuse to do anything <br/>\nwhile they have their few hours of gaming each week. They rush through <br/>\ntheir chores, they rush through their homework, they rush through their <br/>\nmeals to that they can have the precious little time on the games <br/>\nthat&#39;s allowed after all the other requirements are met. When they are <br/>\nnere, all they want to do is to game. Duncan tries to get them to swim <br/>\nor play outside, but they only have eyes for the game systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe end result is that they *know* that their passion will be fed, so <br/>\nthey are willing to use their time for other things too. Including <br/>\nreading. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI sold our n64 because the boys were constantly fighting about using <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what was the lesson learned there? Might is right?<br/>\n<br/>\nWas it financially possible to buy another Nintendo64? and another few <br/>\ngames? Wouldn&#39;t that have also solved the problem?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t help that the oldest has a competitive streak in him and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t really want to encourage (it was learned, not ingrained, I <br/>\nthink).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHard to say---nurture vs nature.

In our house we have unlimited tv, computers and game systems.<br/>\nI think we have 4 tvs, 4 or 5 game systems and 4 computers. We have had<br/>\nunlimited access for at least 6 or 7 years now and we&#39;re heading in that<br/>\ndirection for a few years before that. I think I can safely say I have &quot;seen<br/>\nthe end result of it&quot;.  Yes, they watched a lot tv at first, at least the<br/>\nolder kids did since they had more limits when they were younger.<br/>\nInterestingly enough, my youngest who was raised with the fewest limits<br/>\nprobably watched less tv then the older kids did when they were younger.<br/>\nNow I probably watch more tv than the kids do. We have our shows we like to<br/>\nwatch together.  But it&#39;s really not something I even think about much now.<br/>\nWe lead a busy life. The older kids have jobs, we&#39;re involved in 4-H, we<br/>\nhave some homeschool activities we do, my youngest does Odyssey of the Mind,<br/>\nKarl has choir, the boys and I do church. TV just isn&#39;t the center of their<br/>\nworld. It&#39;s there and used a lot, but it&#39;s just one of the many things we<br/>\ndo. My youngest spends hours a day right now doing some RPG games on-line.<br/>\nBuilding characters, worlds, doing research for both. He loves it. Gaming<br/>\ncomes and goes. My 16 year old is saving for an x-box 360 so when we get<br/>\nthat, I&#39;m sure there will be lots of playing for a while.  One way we<br/>\neliminated the fighting was to be sure there were plenty of computers,  game<br/>\nsystems, controllers, games and tvs for everyone.  We get them used at the<br/>\nlocal game store. TVs are cheap at our local Salvation Army store. Games can<br/>\nbe rented. The other issue of the value of these things....I&#39;ve stopped<br/>\nlooking for &quot;educational value&quot; in what my kids do, I&#39;m quite convinced they<br/>\nlearn all the time.  I know what my kids have learned. (my youngest learned<br/>\nto read and type playing Rune Scape). If I were to try to explain all that<br/>\nmy kids have learned from games, tv, the computer....sheesh, I&#39;d be here for<br/>\nan hour....but alas, work calls...so suffice it to say that my kids are<br/>\ncompetent. They have jobs in the world, they can hold their own and they are<br/>\nhappy and content.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-21, (out on her own now), Lisa-18, Willis-17, Karl-16, & Ben-12.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reachhomeschool.com\">http://www.reachhomeschool.com</a><br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art www.artkunst23.com<br/>\n&quot;All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.&quot;<br/>\n Gandalf the Grey<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 2, 2007 5:26 PM, Adrean Clark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adrean@...\">adrean@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   I have been reading with interest all the comments about video games but<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I still find it hard to believe that allowing kids full rein of<br/>\n&gt; electronics for months on end will actually help them learn<br/>\n&gt; self-control.

It *does* make more sense that when given  <br/>\nfree rein that kids will do nothing but watch junk TV, eat junk food,  <br/>\nplay video games. It&#39;s what everyone says will happen.

So now I say that&#39;s a false  <br/>\ngoal. Self control suggests that the child will always want to play  <br/>\nall day but will decide to limit themselves to 1 or 2 or 5 hours of  <br/>\nplay and turn it off after that amount of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, what happens is that they play to their limit. The limit might be  <br/>\nhow much time they have to play (before a play date or going  <br/>\nshopping) or the limit might be how long they feel like playing. What  <br/>\nthey learn is not self control but to listen to the inner voice of   <br/>\nhow much they feel like playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to parents of children with limits &quot;as long as they feel like it&quot;  <br/>\n*sounds* like all day everyday. Parents may even have experienced all  <br/>\nday gaming sessions when they&#39;ve relaxed the rules so they &quot;know&quot; if  <br/>\nthere were no rules that that is exactly what their kids will do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what those parents have experienced is what their *controlled*  <br/>\nkids are like. They know what their *controlled* kids do when the  <br/>\nrules are relaxed.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who have freedom are totally different creatures than controlled  <br/>\nkids who are given moments of freedom. The difference is as stark as  <br/>\na school group of a field trip to the museum and a family on a visit  <br/>\nthe kids have planned.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor parents who have dropped the rules entirely so that the kids have  <br/>\ngained the confidence that the rules won&#39;t come back, &quot;as much as  <br/>\nthey want to&quot; *isn&#39;t* all day everyday. It might be all day initially  <br/>\nwhen the kids are trying to catch up on all the gaming they&#39;ve been  <br/>\ndenied. It might be initially while the kids try to cram as much  <br/>\ngaming in as they can before the limits return. But once the kids  <br/>\nknow they can turn off the game (or TV or computer) and come back to  <br/>\nit any time they want, they aren&#39;t playing desperately any more.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re playing because they want to in that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you scroll down the menu on the left at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nthere&#39;s lots more on video games and TV. It&#39;s probably one of the  <br/>\nmost frequent topics here! (Though my forte is helping people see why  <br/>\nthey think their beliefs are true and why those beliefs aren&#39;t true.  <br/>\nOther people here are good at explaining the practical  <br/>\nimplementation: what to do instead of what they&#39;re doing now.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I sold our n64 because the boys were constantly fighting about  <br/>\n&gt; using it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And when you step back and look at the problem solving technique you  <br/>\nmodeled for them, you&#39;ve told them through your actions that when  <br/>\nsomeone is doing something you don&#39;t like, it&#39;s perfectly okay to  <br/>\nsteal something of theirs. It&#39;s perfectly okay to ignore their  <br/>\nfeelings because your feelings are more important. You&#39;ve shown them  <br/>\nwith your actions that fighting is an insolvable problem and even  <br/>\nwith your 20 plus years on the planet you have no clue on how to  <br/>\nresolve conflicts. So the best method you&#39;ve come up with is to be  <br/>\nbigger and stronger and make someone do what you want them to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Is* that the model you want to give your kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you ask, mindful parents here can offer ways they&#39;ve respectfully  <br/>\nresolved conflicts between their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the traps that most parents fall into is they turn  <br/>\ntheir kids into the problem. Rather than focusing on ways to help  <br/>\nresolve the problem, they make the problem go away. It&#39;s lots easier!  <br/>\nIt solves a momentary problem but what they don&#39;t see are the  <br/>\nconsequences of momentary solutions. It&#39;s like sticking a rock in  <br/>\neach leak in the dike without being able to see the dike itself or  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s building behind it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you were to poll conventional parents to see how they rate  <br/>\ntheir relationship with their teens and what they think of their  <br/>\nteens as human beings, it would be pretty dismal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you were to poll unschooling, mindful parents to see how  <br/>\nthey rate their relationships with their teens and what they think of  <br/>\ntheir teens as human beings, it would be pretty high! (And if you go  <br/>\nto an unschooling conference you&#39;d see it with your own eyes.)<br/>\n<br/>\n*That&#39;s* the difference helping them versus controlling them makes.  <br/>\nHelping them be who they are versus shaping them into who we think  <br/>\nthey should be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It didn&#39;t help that the oldest has a competitive streak in him and I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t really want to encourage (it was learned, not ingrained, I  <br/>\n&gt; think).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Our kids are who they are. Unschooling and mindful parenting doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nwork with just &quot;nice&quot; kids. In fact it works far better than anything  <br/>\nelse with kids who would be labeled by others.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether learned or nature, preventing competition doesn&#39;t help him  <br/>\ndevelop the skills to handle the feelings he has inside. It just  <br/>\ndrives the need for competition inside where you can&#39;t see it. If  <br/>\nyou&#39;ve shown them that overt competition where you can see it is  <br/>\nsomething that will result in some kind of punishment, what you&#39;re  <br/>\nteaching him is to be sneaky about it. He&#39;s going to compete when  <br/>\nhe&#39;s out of your sight. And he won&#39;t have anyone to help him work on  <br/>\ndeveloping better skills. What could happen -- what you&#39;ve  <br/>\ndemonstrated is the best method you&#39;ve found -- is that being bigger  <br/>\nand stronger is the best way to get what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are plenty of parents here who have competitive children.
