In Aug. 2005, she received a<br/>\n&gt; BMT (bone marrow transplant) courtesy of my 4 year old<br/>\n&gt; daughter Kaylin.  We have been very fortunate and she<br/>\n&gt; is doing very well, though it has been a long road to<br/>\n&gt; travel.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My point here is that life is just too damn short. <br/>\n&gt; Despite all the precautions you may take, stuff<br/>\n&gt; happens.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***I am also happy to hear that your daughter is all right now. I can&#39;t even <br/>\nbegin to imagine what it was like to go through what your family has been <br/>\nthrough. <br/>\n.....and you are right &quot;stuff happens regardless of any precautions you may <br/>\ntake&quot; and life is too short to freak out over every little thing. My Mom always <br/>\ntook pretty good care of herself and it still didn&#39;t stop cancer from taking <br/>\na hold of her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe always tried not to ever limit or force our kids to eat anything and the <br/>\nkitchen is now open at any time, day or night, however, when they were in <br/>\nschool, the kitchen wasn&#39;t so open all the time because of things like bedtimes, <br/>\nearly morning rushes to get there on time, etc., those things that school sort <br/>\nof forces you into. Bringing unschooling into all aspects of life has been such <br/>\nan eye opener. I have actually started to hear our dd&#39;s say things like &quot;I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think I want any more hot tamales for a while (my dd favorite! after <br/>\neating who knows how much!:o) I&#39;m gonna have a salad.&quot; Wow.<br/>\nI always try to have lots of choices around for them, junk food and more <br/>\nhealthier choices so,  with the more healthier choices I usually try to get as <br/>\ngood as we can afford at the time. Although my dh always says that &quot;the <br/>\npesticides keep the bugs away and the preservatives make ya live longer by preserving <br/>\nyou!&quot; :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was growing up I lived in a home where &quot;you have to finish everything <br/>\non your plate before you can leave the table!&quot; (I was so thankful for my dog!) <br/>\nOf course that always made ya want more junk whenever you could get it cuz it <br/>\nwas restricted so much. <br/>\nI am so thankful we have found unschooling!
