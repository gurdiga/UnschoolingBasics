It may just that this boy hasn&#39;t gotten to the place of Empathy<br/>\nyet. Or he may turn out to be, in the fullness of time, the first documented<br/>\nfailure of the Unschooling process in this area...<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I do know how it feels to be around kids (and sometimes parents) who<br/>\nmake me feel out of whack with the combination of energies.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Does anyone else have an experience similar to this?  If so, how do/did<br/>\nyou handle it?  Do I &#39;go there&#39; with the mother?  Leave it be?  Limit our<br/>\ntime together?  <br/>\n <br/>\nA sticky situation, however, is that my 6yo son wants to hang out with him.<br/>\nAnd when they spend time together, both of my children usually end up<br/>\ngetting very frustrated, the 6yo usually teary, and the 4yo takes on many of<br/>\nsaid child&#39;s little mannerisms.  What to do, what do do? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is sticky....<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that limiting contact of someone that Jayn really loves even<br/>\nthough I don&#39;t, backfires. She just focuses even more on wanting to play<br/>\nwith the girl. I just work on keeping myself centered and Detached (in the<br/>\nZen way of observing my feelings without acting or making judgments as best<br/>\nI can) from feelings or irritation. I don&#39;t want to make it about me, if you<br/>\nknow what I mean. Either Jayn will come to care about the girl&#39;s character<br/>\ndefects that are obvious to me, or she won&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is another child, not a homeschooler (all the kids I see as less than<br/>\nideal amongst Jayn&#39;s play mates are schooled), that we play with regularly.<br/>\nIt seems that Jayn is often in a state of stress after we leave her,<br/>\nalthough it is not that they have fought or had trouble playing happily. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe will react by creating a conflict with me (eg demands to go to the toy<br/>\nstore when we are almost home already or some other excessive reaction). She<br/>\nneeds me to be a stalwart object to push against to get her good cry out.<br/>\nWhat I do is support her need to work through it, even though it is<br/>\nsometimes unpleasant. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact I had a lot of angst about these demanding outbursts until I<br/>\nrealized the pattern, and how this was one case when the real need was not<br/>\nwhat was being overtly expressed. After the storm Jayn returns to being her<br/>\nsweetest self.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have tried to do is expand the number of contacts Jayn has, although<br/>\ntbh recently Jayn has been in a hunker down at home phase, and has been<br/>\nreally reluctant to go to park days, our best source of contact renewal. She<br/>\nis also going through an anti-boy phase. <br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt that there is much you can say to the mother that she might not take<br/>\nas a criticism - &quot;Your son is rude and messy&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t ask more of visiting kids than I would ask of Jayn, although there<br/>\nare times when I feel that they take advantage of the aura of freedom that<br/>\npervades our home. I also don&#39;t ask less of them in most respects.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Depends.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut both my boys have always taken their plates to the sink. And we ask their guests to do the same.

It seems so counter-intuitive because it is so the<br/>\nopposite of conventional parenting and cultural expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is simply because children live up to what is modeled for them<br/>\nand how they are treated. What is being modeled (by the cleaning gifts and<br/>\npresumably parental courteous behavior when dining at friends&#39; homes) are<br/>\nthe Principles of Kindness, Giving and Consideration for Others, instead of<br/>\nthe idea of &quot;Every one *has to* take of themselves because no-one will help<br/>\nyou&quot; or &quot;You are a bad person if you don&#39;t do things for others, but no-one<br/>\nwill do things for you&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe children have the experience of Generosity, and end up wanting to give<br/>\nto others freely. They are not carrying resentments from being forced, or<br/>\njudged negatively or the feeling like they are held to a higher standard<br/>\nthan the adults in their lives. They are not waiting for the moment that<br/>\nthey are out from under anyone&#39;s thumb to behave as they would wish to. They<br/>\nare not acting from a wellspring of installed guilt.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

(My oldest is four.) But I have one concern that <br/>\nI&#39;m hoping you guys can clarify for me:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you regularly clean up their room and toys, etc, as a &quot;gift&quot; to <br/>\nthem, don&#39;t they grow up thinking that picking up is not their <br/>\nproblem or responsibility, that some one is always going to come <br/>\nalong and do it for them? <br/>\n<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t that lead to going to other people&#39;s houses, say, for <br/>\ndinner, and just walking away when they&#39;re done eating because, hey, <br/>\nputting away dishes and helping clear tables isn&#39;t something *I* do -<br/>\n- other people are supposed to do it for me? Or wouldn&#39;t it make <br/>\nthem have no qualms about littering, because, hey, at home, I make <br/>\nall kinds of messes and no one complains or expects me to clean it <br/>\nup? Wouldn&#39;t it lead to think of your parents as your personal <br/>\nservants and to treat them with a sort of &quot;I snap my fingers and you <br/>\njump&quot; kind of attitude?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously the answer to this is not &quot;Yes,&quot; but if someone would <br/>\nexplain WHY it doesn&#39;t work that way, (because to me it seems like <br/>\nit would), I would appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8209,"nextTopicId":8349}}
