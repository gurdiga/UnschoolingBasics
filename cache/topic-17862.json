It sounds like she might feel the same way. How are you<br/>\nwording it? It sounds to me like you want to *win* the argument as much as<br/>\nshe does.

This might make it feel safer for her to<br/>\nconcede your point. Our first reaction when we feel threatened is to fight<br/>\nback.

I imagine that a no to an always unschooled  <br/>\nor long time unschooled child is no big deal and is probably more  <br/>\naccepted than a no, even a respectful one, to a schooled child. I&#39;m  <br/>\ntalking about realy natural limits.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe topics were things like siblings fighting and being very  <br/>\ndisrespectful/unfriendly; hitting siblings or pets. Often have I read  <br/>\nthat it was ok to say &quot;I will not let you treat me like that&quot;, &quot;I  <br/>\nwill not let anybody speak to me/her like that&quot; or &quot;I will not let  <br/>\nyou hurt him/her/it&quot; or something like that. But I wonder how do you  <br/>\nenforce that then? (In case they continue?) What do you do if they  <br/>\nstill do it? How do you &quot;not let&quot; them? Do I go away? Do I take the  <br/>\nkid away from the pet? Do I take the pet? Do I raise my voice?<br/>\n<br/>\nI said it once to my daughter when because of &quot;nothing&quot; she was  <br/>\nyelling at me and being very very unfriendly. I calmly said I  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t let her treat me that way; but also tried to find out what  <br/>\nthe &quot;nothing&quot; was and we found out. I still wondered though what I  <br/>\nwould have done to &quot;not let&quot; her if she had continued. I scratched my  <br/>\nhead and hoped she wouldn&#39;t :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we first started unschooling/gentle parenting, she seemed so  <br/>\nextremely happy about her freedom, she seemed so grateful that she  <br/>\nwas really very friendly all of the sudden, she would help with  <br/>\neverything and was saying thank you and all kinds of nice things all  <br/>\nday. Now she&#39;s getting more and more unfriendly and demanding,  <br/>\ndisrespectful, if something doesn&#39;t work she&#39;ll yell and be angry and  <br/>\nblame you and even though I try to help her she is already extremely  <br/>\nunfriendly and yells at me. I sure think there is a reason and mostly  <br/>\nwe have figured out what the real problem was. I still have  <br/>\ndifficulties to deal with this unfriendlyness because it makes me  <br/>\nfeel angry after a while (when it has happened a lot during the day),  <br/>\nand then it&#39;s hard to stay calm. So I tried the &quot;I won&#39;t let you...&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would apreciate any ideas on how to deal with this better,  <br/>\npractical advice on what one could say instead. Btw, it&#39;s not that I  <br/>\nyell when I can&#39;t controle it, but I just say nothing and feel like  <br/>\ncrap for being treated that way and not knowing how to handle the  <br/>\nsituation. I feel that just letting her do it is not ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, sometimes she&#39;ll say something that isn&#39;t true. She&#39;s sure it  <br/>\nis how she&#39;s saying it but I KNOW she just wasn&#39;t attentive at the  <br/>\ntime and I&#39;m 1000000% sure it&#39;s how I&#39;m saying it.
