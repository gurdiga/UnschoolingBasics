I remember I was taking care of this 3 year old little boy.  He was taking swim lessons at the Y.  First day of swimming lessons the instructor grabbed him and shoved him in the water.  Of course this little boy freaked!  Not only was the instructor a stranger to him, but he was being put in the water against his will.  I took him, dried him off, and took him home.  When I told his Mother she freaked too.  It just felt so wrong.  When I took my girls in as foster children, I let them do the swimming thing on their terms.  Lexi (8) spent two summers just sitting on the side of the pool.  The third year she only went in occasionally.  Well now at 8 she is a fish, and loves to swim.  And I do not allow my children to hold anyone under water, it&#39;s a safety issue........no room for negotiation.  And I would never allow anyone else to hold my children under water, even if it meant<br/>\n me removing the child away from my child.  So you did the right thing where these friends were concerned, and you did the right thing with letting your kids learn to swim on their terms.  <br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:singdoula@...\">singdoula@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n          <br/>\n<br/>\nthank you everyone for making me feel better about the lost friendship <br/>\nthing!

What their kids are doing in school of course.  So I always end up feeling like the odd man out.  Even when our family gets together with friends inevitably people start talking about what their kids are doing at school.  Although with our really close friends it does not matter........they accept our lifestyle and they accept ours.  I also have a problem with the show off, bullying, competitive type kids.  One day the girls came in the house and told me that one of the neighborhood kids said that if you homeschool you are not learning anything.  It&#39;s one kid in particular that keeps saying these kinds of things to them......he is seriously misinformed.  So I&#39;ve discussed with my kids that they are learning!  And I just find it so beautiful and refreshing that we are not caught up in the game of Oh, my Billy got an A+ in Math, what did your Susie get?  Or Billy is the<br/>\n star of his soccer team, does your Johnny do sports?  And I think eventually my girls will effectively weed out the snobbish, bullying, competitive types and hang out with kids that love them for who they are.  <br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:singdoula@...\">singdoula@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n          <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone been really great friends with a family when all your collective <br/>\nchildren were little, then once the kids (from the other family) started <br/>\nschool you found that you couldn&#39;t socialize with them anymore?
