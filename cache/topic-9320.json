When I joined this list it is because I wanted to learn more about and receive support for my decision to help my children learn through unschooling.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1740860939\">Hey Cari!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I joined this list it is because I wanted to learn more about and receive support for my decision to help my children learn through unschooling.  However, once I arrived I found out that many people in this group have extended unschooling to all areas of their lives.  Of course we know that unschooling is all about allowing children learn in the way that is most comfortable to them with us as parents supporting them and connecting with them through their interests.  Unschooling is really all about trust.  So, why not trust the children in all areas of their lives to include what they eat?  I had hang ups about TV and junk food when I first joined.  What was told to me was to not control what your children eat and how much TV they watch.  I thought, WHAT!  All Khalfani, ds1, wants to eat is junk and all he wants to do is binge on TV.  It was right around Halloween that I met this great group of people so I started with Halloween candy we started because Khalfani was asking every few minutes if he could have some.  So,  I allowed Khalfani and Kamau to eat candy whenever they wanted.  I left the bag down and they came and went as they pleased. It was killing me but I figured that I had nothing to lose by trying out the suggestion of losing parental controls on TV and food.  Khalfani ate so much candy that day that he got sick.  I know it is because he has never had freedom to eat sugar however he wants.  As a matter of fact, I have always been anti sugar because I struggle to not eat so much of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom that day on though Khalfani has self-regulated.  I like the way I have heard others talk about sweets and junk, they place no value of it in comparison to other food.  As a result, it does not stand out to the child.  But by us controlling what they eat, it makes them hyperfocus on that particular food.  I also don&#39;t like controlling what children eat because I feel that it turns off their ability to self-regulate.  If they have to depend on us to decide what they eat for many years, then how can we expect them to know how to do so once we relinquish control back to them?  Since extending the unschooling philosophy to eating and TV, it is a nonissue.  Sometimes my children awaken and ask for ice cream.  I give it to them and don&#39;t think twice about it because in the same vein, they will also eventually ask for something that does not fall into the sugar or junk categories.  Some days they eat little junk and other days they eat a lot.  I no longer focus on it and they do self-regulate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor people who are particularly health conscious, it can make you crazy initially.  I don&#39;t try to limit the amount of junk or sweets that we have in the house.  It is almost impossible to do with Craig here, who by the way, does a great job of self-regulating.  I am the one who has eating issues.  But, I find that when we have junk and don&#39;t limit the children, the junk food stays around way longer and is now being thrown away because it spoils.  I do offer all types of food throughout the day which satisfies the health nut in me but I always ask them what they want to eat, especially Khalfani, because he has the most sensitive palate in the house.  Kamau is way more open to eating other foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that it has taken time for me to see how it all balances out when we allow our children to follow their own inner knowing.  The other benefit that I find is that is allows me more time to enjoy my children rather than trying to regulate areas of their lives that they are fully capable of  handling now.  These children were programmed with an infinite amount of wisdom and the only way we can fully see this wisdom is to allow them to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch Love to you<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: mamacari78 <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, January 19, 2006 7:28 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Food Controls?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am new to the unschooling way, so can you guys please give me an <br/>\n  overview of what the goals are of losing food controls?<br/>\n  My six year old would eat nothing but sugar if I allowed.

Whether it&#39;s about food or TV or sleep or later on sex or drugs, I want my kids to be comfortable making their own choices. I want them used to listening to their own body, mind,  inner voice and intuition. I want them to recognize me and their father as allies who are working in their best interests. I want them to learn to recognize when someone does not have their best interests at heart also.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one child who is a teen and one who is almost there. All those horror stories about teen rebellion have just not happened in our house. Sure someone will get moody or balk at the occasional request, but more often than not they&#39;re really nice to be with. We don&#39;t have big fights in our home. I really *like* them both. They&#39;ve had practice at making their own *real* choices for years. They&#39;ve been able to choose what and when to eat, when and where to sleep, what to buy, what and how much to read or watch on TV, etc. As such they&#39;re ready to tackle the big issues now with some reasoning tools in their emotional toolbox.

I want them to learn to recognize when someone does not have their best interests at heart also.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one child who is a teen and one who is almost there. All those horror stories about teen rebellion have just not happened in our house. Sure someone will get moody or balk at the occasional request, but more often than not they&#39;re really nice to be with. We don&#39;t have big fights in our home. I really *like* them both. They&#39;ve had practice at making their own *real* choices for years. They&#39;ve been able to choose what and when to eat, when and where to sleep, what to buy, what and how much to read or watch on TV, etc. As such they&#39;re ready to tackle the big issues now with some reasoning tools in their emotional toolbox.

This was following an evening where she fell asleep before getting her icecream dessert as planned.  When she woke up in the morning and realized she missed her icecream she was angry.  I told her she could have ice cream for breakfast.  Her eyes lit up and she said, &quot;really?&quot; - &quot;Sure&quot; was my response.  &quot;For breakfast, lunch and dinner and in between, if you want.&quot;  It was one of those really great joyful unschooling days.  From morning till night.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner and in between. By the time she got to dinner she declared she wanted &quot;real food&quot; - her words not mine.  This was two years ago at age 5.  She has asked if she could do this again.  The answer is of course yes.  She hasn&#39;t done this again.  I think just knowing she can is enough.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy older dd did go through a period where she asked me to assist her in her food choices.  She asked me to say no or yes to her.  So i did, based on my own understandings of healthy eating.  Her need for me to guide her on this was short lived.  She doesn&#39;t struggle with food and along with some food that is not nutritious she chooses for herself a very healthy balanced day.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Food Controls?","postDate":"1137725270","msgId":9322,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRxcGowbSsxMGhicEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRxcGVjYSttOWhtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9320,"nextInTopic":9358,"prevInTime":9321,"nextInTime":9323,"topicId":9320,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If he keeps hearing &#39;eating 3 cookies will make you <br/>\nsick&#39; and one day he eats 3 cookies and feels fine, then what? <br/>\nEverything else is in question. Rather, slowly remove the &#39;special&#39; <br/>\nstatus of sugar until it is simply one of many options. I have a 7 yr <br/>\nold DS who has never had food controls (so it&#39;s a slightly different <br/>\nscenario). I made 4 dozen cookies last night. He at 4 over the course <br/>\nof about 2 hours and stopped without my saying a word. They were just <br/>\nsitting there at the table, freely available. Another example from my <br/>\nDS: he discovered &quot;Swiss Cake Rolls&quot; a couple years ago. He just loved <br/>\nthem. So, I&#39;d buy a box each time I went grocery shopping and he&#39;d <br/>\nfinish them off in a few days. Then they were on sale one week - 5 <br/>\nboxes $5. So I picked up 5 (actually, he was with me so I told him to <br/>\ngrab 5 boxes - he was grinning ear to ear as he stocked our cart with <br/>\nthem). The first box disappeared in a couple days as usual. The next <br/>\nbox a little slower until *I* was taking them in my lunch because he <br/>\nwas done with them, he was satisfied and knew he could have them if he <br/>\nwanted them in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, definitely keep tasty nutritious stuff on handy and be proactive <br/>\nabout it - often sugary snack foods are a quick easy thing to grab <br/>\nwhen hungry. So, rather than let it get to that, bring some cut up <br/>\nfruit chunks, cheese, &#39;trail mix&#39;, whatever into his range while he&#39;s <br/>\nplaying or watching a movie or whatever. But &#39;healthy&#39; is a somewhat <br/>\nambiguous target &#39;healthy&#39; based on a vegan outlook or an omnivorous <br/>\none? for example - rather, maybe try for &#39;balance&#39; in all things, some <br/>\nsweets among all the other choices. Make cookies at home rather than <br/>\nbuying them to have more say over the ingredients (like no <br/>\nhydrogenateds or HFCS or dyes). And, of course, if there are allergies <br/>\nor food sensitivities, obviously those need to be watched. BUT not <br/>\nunilaterally. Provide information to your child &quot;let&#39;s get this juice <br/>\nbox because that one has ascorbozylifructiholamine and that often <br/>\ngives you an upset stomach&quot; My DS, having been provided information, <br/>\nconversationally, not as something to scare or rebuke him (&quot;NO you <br/>\ncan&#39;t have that it has additive MNOPQR in it&quot;) but rather &quot;I think <br/>\nyou&#39;ll feel more comfortable inside you if we get some protein before <br/>\nyou have more cake. How about I get a PBJ?&quot; By discussing, naturally, <br/>\nnot didactically, what various nutrients do, he has a very balanced <br/>\nidea of what things help him feel good, have energy, etc and what <br/>\nstuff he might want to go easy on sometimes - he&#39;s very particular <br/>\nespecially about sodium (DH is hypertensive)and potassium balances and <br/>\nabout cholesterol and fat levels in foods. We still buy ice cream and <br/>\ntortilla chips and salsa and I make cookies on a pretty regular basis <br/>\nand DS, of all of us, has the most balanced attitude of all because no <br/>\none food or type of food has been elevated or made forbidden.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, lots of rambling thoughts, hope something makes sense. I think I <br/>\nshould stop now - it&#39;s getting toward my bedtime<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237503734,"authorName":"mamacari78","from":"&quot;mamacari78&quot; &lt;mamacari78@...&gt;","profile":"mamacari78","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Food Controls?","postDate":"1137720522","msgId":9320,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRxcGVjYSttOWhtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9322,"prevInTime":9319,"nextInTime":9321,"topicId":9320,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am new to the unschooling way, so can you guys please give me an overview of what the goals are of losing food controls?
