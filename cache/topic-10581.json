It is something we all do<br/>\nto be safe. I did tell her that she needed to buckle her belt before we<br/>\nleft. Because my car usually carries more then my kids, I have booster seats<br/>\nand cool things that go on the buckles so that they don&#39;t choke the kids or<br/>\nchaff.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually, the most I ever have to ask a child is, &quot;Can you buckle your belt<br/>\nor do you need me to do it?&quot; When S said she didn&#39;t want to do it, I didn&#39;t<br/>\neven get a chance to say anything more because my son jumped up and buckled<br/>\nher in. She didn&#39;t object or shoo him away - she let him do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, March 10, 2006 12:14 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] RE:safety issues - seat belts<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t see anyone advocating NO seatbelts but rather more  towards peaceful<br/>\n<br/>\nchild led parenting. <br/>\nIs that not why we unschool?
