I would love to hear from<br/>\nmore people where both parents work and can still unschool their<br/>\nchild. We don&#39;t have family near us, so our options are limited.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, we&#39;ve both worked for most of our homeschooling and unschooling<br/>\njourney.  Most of the time, I was able to just pick up odd jobs<br/>\n(cleaning, babysitting etc..) where I wasn&#39;t gone for long, or I could<br/>\nbring the kids along.<br/>\nBUT, since &#39;01, I&#39;ve been working as a makeup artist for several<br/>\ncompanies and am now full-time with Lancome. I&#39;m not going to say it&#39;s<br/>\neasy, but I think about all the scheduling and stress of adding school<br/>\nto our lives and unschooling is the BEST choice hands-down.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids wouldn&#39;t be very easy to coerce at this point anyway!;)<br/>\nDh and I have always found a way to work our schedules around each<br/>\nother and be creative. I&#39;m just getting used to being gone almost 40<br/>\nhours a week, while he&#39;s home with them and it&#39;s NOT as fun as being<br/>\nthe stay-at-home parent!! wah...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut things will change, it&#39;s not permament and my kids get to maintain<br/>\ntheir very free lifestyle. Yesterday, they played outside almost all<br/>\nday and when I came home from work, dh was playing Monopoly with them.<br/>\nI know they&#39;re happy, loved and free. So it takes the sting out of<br/>\nmissing them so much.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10475,"nextTopicId":10454}}
