It felt very unnatural posing like that of<br/>\ncourse, but that&#39;s their call.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe actually had her using the saw for several pics, it was SO loud. I<br/>\nkept saying &quot;she could just act like she&#39;s using it!&quot; but I think he<br/>\nreally was fascinated with a 9y.o. girl that could handle a compound<br/>\nmiter saw like a pro.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter he got sawdust on his camera lense, he decided to stop asking<br/>\nher to cut with the thing!!
