It is different than nursing in public.

I had been trying to wean her since 12 months and was having trouble with it and that gave me the motivation to do what I had tried to do 5 months beforehand.  If someone thought it was an issue I was brestfeeding my 3 month old (which I do now) I wouldn&#39;t even give them a second thought. When they had an issue with my 17 month old nursing, it made me think because what happens when she turns two years old and then three years old and still nurses? I am just not comfortable with that. Maybe pumping would be another alternative (which I didn&#39;t do) but I just don&#39;t feel its appropiate to nurse a child that old. (Yes, I know I should duck and run now.. but I have tried to weigh the pros and cons of breastfeeding after a certain point and the cons have outweighed the pros for me.
