I have a dear friend whose children are in public<br/>\nschool.  Anytime one of her homeschooling friends even mentions something<br/>\nhomeschool related she becomes defensive and mentions that she is hurt by<br/>\nour judging her when we weren&#39;t judging at all.  It could be something as<br/>\nsimple as mentioning a homeschool activity such as a recent discussion about<br/>\na museum exhibit and mentioning that we had attended with our homeschool<br/>\ngroup.  Sometimes I think she feels like she could be doing more with her<br/>\nchildren so just the mention of what she sees as a lacking on her part feels<br/>\nlike criticism.  Not that we are criticizing, but that she is critical of<br/>\nher own decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother always questions why I am &quot;doing this.&quot;  She doesn&#39;t understand<br/>\nwhy I would want to do &quot;all this work&quot; when the school system can do it for<br/>\nme.  She has said to me before, &quot;School was good enough for you.&quot;  Ah, but<br/>\nhow much different would I be had I been homeschooled?  My mother is<br/>\ndefensive because I am doing something different, making different<br/>\ndecisions, than she did.  What she did wasn&#39;t &quot;as good.&quot;  I&#39;ve learned not<br/>\nto complain about anything to my mother.  Not lack of free time, feeling<br/>\noverburdened on weeks when we have a crammed full schedule, not sleeping<br/>\nwell, Dan working late hours, etc because it is all (in her mind) related to<br/>\nthe children not being in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12855,"nextTopicId":12921}}
