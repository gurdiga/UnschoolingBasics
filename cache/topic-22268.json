It doesn&#39;t bother me, but I know it <br/>\nbothers other people and he knows it bothers other people. So he doesn&#39;t say <br/>\nit around his grandparents or around new people or around some of his <br/>\nfriends parents. And that is because we&#39;ve talked about it. I&#39;ve talked <br/>\nabout what words and ideas some people might find offensive. And why. It is <br/>\npart of being the parent, helping your child to know what the social <br/>\nniceties are and what the potential consequences might be, ie, upsetting <br/>\ngrandma, not being invited back to a friend&#39;s, having others think badly of <br/>\nyou. I can&#39;t keep him from swearing or talking about Family Guy in front of <br/>\nothers, nor would I want to act as his censor, but I can help him to know <br/>\nwho is less likely to appreciate the information. That said, penis enlarges <br/>\nand fembots (with their machine gun jubblies) are pretty interesting topics <br/>\nof conversation. I googled fembots just now and wikipedia has an entry on <br/>\nGynoid (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynoid)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynoid)</a>, the female form of android, <br/>\nwhich includes fembots. I had forgotten the fembots in the Bionic Women, <br/>\napparently the first, with the robotic mechanism under their faces.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if you should tell your children not to talk about Austen <br/>\nPowers, but you could probably talk to them about what others might feel <br/>\nuncomfortable with and why.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side query, why are you sure your son would be talking about the penis <br/>\nenlarger or the fembots? A lot of those things aren&#39;t the things that Simon <br/>\nor Linnaea are paying attention to when they watch. Yesterday they were <br/>\nwatching Goldmember and were talking intently about how long they&#39;ve peed <br/>\nand how asparagus can make your pee smell differently. They weren&#39;t talking <br/>\nabout the name Dixie Normous or any of the other sex jokes in Austen Powers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Amy Mason&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:doodlemakers@...\">doodlemakers@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysUnschooled@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysUnschooled@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;; <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CrunchyUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com\">CrunchyUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 16, 2007 3:36 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] kids living without censoring and how that <br/>\naffects friends/neighbors<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re relatively new with unschooling (last fall) and have turned into<br/>\n&gt; radicals (how could we not have before because it is /just so right/,<br/>\n&gt; shame on me...(thank you Rue for your book and Danielle and Sandra and<br/>\n&gt; all of the other seasoned folk out there) but I still am working on<br/>\n&gt; releasing myself from a lot of issues.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One issue is in regards to not censoring what children want to watch on<br/>\n&gt; tv...not so much as how it affects my kids but how it affects those<br/>\n&gt; around them.
