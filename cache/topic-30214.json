I believe unschooling has  given <br/>\nher the wings and the courage and the desire to live each day as fully as  she <br/>\ndoes.  She would probably rather I didn&#39;t sing her praises but I love  the <br/>\nchance to talk about how &quot;neat&quot; she is..&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nBrenna has been homeschooled since she was 8 and unschooled since she was  <br/>\n13.  The unschooling has made all the difference in her life and in  ours.<br/>\n <br/>\n She takes classes at a community college, has been offered numerous  <br/>\nscholarships and has decided to go to New College in Sarasota, Florida, this  coming <br/>\nfall semester.  She sings, works at a Young Chefs Academy,  sings, plays the <br/>\nguitar, spends time with her boyfriend, enjoys her classes,  hangs out with us <br/>\nand I find her amazing and a joy to be around.  Did I  mention she sings?  :-) <br/>\n All the time.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe was a regional problem captain for Odyssey of the Mind yesterday, in  <br/>\ncharge of 11 adult judges that she conducted training for last weekend.  I  <br/>\nwatched some of the problems and was just amazed at her attention to detail and  <br/>\nability to coordinate and manage an all day event that rested on her shoulders.  <br/>\nShe received a scholarship from Odyssey of the Mind at the awards ceremony <br/>\nlast  night.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn two weeks, she is performing as Dorothy in a weekend long Wizard of Oz  <br/>\ncelebration.  In May, we going to the Life is Good Unschooling  Conference and <br/>\nthen she is going to travel a bit on the west coast.  In September, she is one <br/>\nof the speakers at the Live and Learn Conference  in North Carolina.  She&#39;s <br/>\nalready working on her speech.   Come  to that conference and you&#39;ll meet and <br/>\nhear another amazing young adult, Cameron  Lovejoy, who is also living his full <br/>\nlife and making a difference in the lives  of those he meets.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThese two young adults are not the exceptions.  Across the board, the  <br/>\nunschooled teens we know are interesting because they are interested in  life and <br/>\nlearning and they are fun to be around because they are  joyful,  kind and <br/>\nrespected and trusted by their families.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe unschooled teens we know each have stories to tell and are living  these <br/>\nlarge lives free of school.  So many accomplishments from them all,  but by <br/>\nfar their largest &quot;accomplishment&quot; is the thoughtfulness that  they bring to <br/>\ntheir relationships with their families and friends.  It&#39;s  easy to find teens <br/>\nanywhere who have a laundry list of things they&#39;ve  done.  It&#39;s how they&#39;ve done <br/>\nthese things and how they live  their lives that make these unschooling young <br/>\nadults unique.  They  live life from their hearts and that&#39;s what makes the <br/>\nbiggest difference.<br/>\n <br/>\n Gail<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nGail <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gail-hummingbirdhaven.blogspot.com/\">http://gail-hummingbirdhaven.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Ideas to please picky eaters.
