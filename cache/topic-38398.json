It is mostly taking turns that bothers them right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking about making a chart of who has done certain things to make sure everyone gets a turn. I hate charts so I was REALLY reluctant to do this. But unless someone has a better idea, I think it might help in this situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also thinking of doing the wrinkled heart activity. Has anyone done that or read about it before? I thought that might be a good way to see how what you say affects the person you say it to. I really want to girls to respect their own feelings/boundaries while respecting the others in our group. It is a really hard thing to do with so many different personalities and this age. Mostly I don&#39;t like how they are hurting each others feelings. A few parents have just said it is normal for this age but I don&#39;t think it makes it right. I don&#39;t really think most of them realize how mean they are being. They are all GREAT girls. I really cherish each of their uniqueness. I think if they could work out the kinks they will all get along great (as much as groups do) and we will have a really fun group!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":219090806,"authorName":"cindybablitz","from":"&quot;cindybablitz&quot; &lt;cindy.bablitz@...&gt;","profile":"cindybablitz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Girl Scout troop","postDate":"1235203301","msgId":38412,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdub2NkNStxZ3JyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdubDhlaytxOG5hQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38399,"nextInTopic":38742,"prevInTime":38411,"nextInTime":38413,"topicId":38398,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... http://www.amazon.com/Cooperative-Sports-Games-Book- Competition/dp/0394422155 By a Canadian author -- great resource.

I have <br/>\nbeen noticing as the year goes on that my girls are having some issues <br/>\nwith each other. I think it is in part due to school (my dd is the only <br/>\nhsing child let alone radical unschooled child!)I am the leader of the <br/>\ntroop and I am trying to find ways to help the children deal with each <br/>\nother. <br/>\nA lot of the girls are being really mean to each other. I think it is <br/>\nin part due to being around each other a lot. Secondly because of their <br/>\nown family dynamics. <br/>\nI think our next meeting is going to be about respecting each other and <br/>\nourselves etc. I am hopeing to show them that we should try and treat <br/>\neveryone respectfully. Such a hard thing at this age with children that <br/>\nI doubt are given much respect. My dd is having a hard time dealing <br/>\nwith a couple of girls because they are SO mean and she has never been <br/>\ntreated that way before. Tonight I talked her through some ways to <br/>\nproblem solve, one being to avoid them. (her idea) Another was to plain <br/>\ntell them they are being mean and she doesn&#39;t like it. Thankfully she <br/>\nisn&#39;t usually targeted (this is actually the first time) but it bothers <br/>\nher when they are mean to others because she is so in tune with others <br/>\nfeelings.<br/>\nSo really the answer I would like is how to help them as a group to get <br/>\nalong. Any fun games we could play to instill respecting each other. <br/>\nAlso how to explain to our dd how to deal with others in these <br/>\nsituations because it is part of life. Any good tips?? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nJessica:)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38668,"nextTopicId":38743}}
