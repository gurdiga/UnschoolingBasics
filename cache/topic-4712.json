When my kids were at school and I<br/>\nwas haveing to deal with problems there every week or so, I asked my husband<br/>\nto take a turn looking out for his kids, speaking to teachers and<br/>\nheadmaster, making sure the kids had what they needed for school, that sort<br/>\nof thing.  That was a nice way of telling him that if he wants those kids in<br/>\nschool so bad, then he need to help handle the situation, &#39;cause I had had<br/>\nenough of that stupid school and those hateful children my kids had to live<br/>\nwith all day long, every day, with no way out!!  I was impressed by how<br/>\nquickly my dear husband, (who is a loving daddy) came around to support<br/>\nhomeschooling!  Once he saw how stressful it really was for the children and<br/>\nfor me, (esp. not being able to help my son protect himself!!), he changed<br/>\nhis tune.<br/>\n    Also, as far as getting your 9 yo out of school immediately, maybe you<br/>\ncan find another homeschooling family for your son to hang out with while<br/>\nyou are at work.  Or two of them, on alternating days or something.<br/>\nPersonally, my kids would love to have some company, maybe there&#39;s a family<br/>\nlike ours in your area.  You just need someone to be with him during the day<br/>\nwhile you are at work, right?  You don&#39;t have to be with him yourself.<br/>\nAlthough that would be best, it&#39;s only for a few months.<br/>\n     And I agree with Ren:  Don&#39;t buy a house based on two incomes!  Bad<br/>\nidea even for people with no children.<br/>\n    Also, I have never heard of graduating from 8th grade.  But I guess now<br/>\nthat it&#39;s so important to your son, you can&#39;t really do much but be<br/>\nsupportive....<br/>\nDeirdre<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   From: &quot;Queana&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:queana7@...\">queana7@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n - if I quit to bring him home, I will not be able to afford my 8th<br/>\ngrader graduating with his class.  We will not be able to afford our new<br/>\nhouse.  My husband would be very unsupportive of this idea (and he just<br/>\nrecently became finally supportive of homeschooling).</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4709,"nextTopicId":4714}}
