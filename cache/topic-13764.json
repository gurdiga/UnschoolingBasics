Are the kids running around and being noisy?  Are they <br/>\ntaking over the television?  Are they asking for help in getting <br/>\nthings or doing things?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy downtime is time alone in the bath with a book.  I want to stop <br/>\nthinking about everything and just be absorbed in a good story.  <br/>\nSometimes I prefer sitting on my deck to read, but as long as I&#39;m <br/>\nalone so I can focus solely on my book, I can feel recharged after <br/>\nabout half an hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DH&#39;s downtime is that the kids stop making noise and stop asking <br/>\nfor things and allow him to just sit and veg out with his laptop for <br/>\na while.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went through a very busy phase last year when the kids were <br/>\nalternating requests.  It was crazy.  One would ask for a drink.  <br/>\nWe&#39;d ask if the other wanted something while we were in the kitchen <br/>\nand the offer was always declined.  Instead, the other child would <br/>\nwait about 10 or 15 minutes and then ask for something.  It was up, <br/>\ndown, up, down, up, down, from 6pm to 9pm and it was exhausting.  In <br/>\nan effort to save our sanity, we brainstormed solutions as a whole <br/>\nfamily.  We moved dishes around so they could be easily reached by <br/>\nthe children.  We taught them how to use the microwave.  We bought <br/>\nsimple containers to use for drinks, like CapriSun pouches instead <br/>\nof big jugs of juice, and small rubbermaid cups with lids for <br/>\nchocolate milks.  We make sure we have easy to eat snacks ready to <br/>\ngo, like cut up fruit, deli meat and cheese.  They enjoy doing <br/>\nthings for themselves.  They choose quieter activities in the <br/>\nevenings rather than loud playing.  It&#39;s all worked out well, but it <br/>\ndefinitely took us communicating well as a family so that everyone&#39;s <br/>\nneeds were met.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227479134,"authorName":"susan throssell","from":"&quot;susan throssell&quot; &lt;susanthrossell@...&gt;","profile":"susanthrossell","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"7"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Help with my Husband","postDate":"1148932516","msgId":13768,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEwNi1GNzBCM0EwNTlDNUFCRjNFNDc2QUJEREI5RDBAcGh4LmdibD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGU1ZmoxNytmYm1yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13767,"nextInTopic":13770,"prevInTime":13767,"nextInTime":13769,"topicId":13764,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"thanks joanne, that does help susan","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-433325588\">thanks joanne,<br/>\n<br/>\nthat does help<br/>\n<br/>\nsusan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Help with my Husband","postDate":"1148931943","msgId":13767,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU1ZmoxNytmYm1yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTEwNi1GMTk2MkM1MzNCMTM5NTFDRTM1REY1NURCOUQwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":13766,"nextInTopic":13768,"prevInTime":13766,"nextInTime":13768,"topicId":13764,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Susan, Your husband is deserving of his down time and maybe all of you could come up with some solutions to help him get it.
