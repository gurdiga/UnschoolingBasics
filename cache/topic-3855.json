For my daughter (now 8) we<br/>\nwould add the two numbers together and she writes on a<br/>\npad.  (Each person does the same on their turn, unless<br/>\nyour little one is only into counting the dots on the<br/>\ndice).

You can also use multiplication with<br/>\nthis game....it&#39;s a really fun way to get some<br/>\npractice with computation.  <br/>\nWe also have bought some Bicycle card games for 99<br/>\ncents a piece...we love these....one is Duo ( a<br/>\nstrategy/critical thinking game) and Ten Speed (a game<br/>\nwhere you make matches to equal ten....the basis of<br/>\nall)....I find that both my kids (8 and 5) can add so<br/>\nwell in their heads when they think in terms of ten.  <br/>\nI hope this helps....<br/>\nBeth (who loves math, without the worksheets!!)  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; vote.yahoo.com - Register online to vote today!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://vote.yahoo.com\">http://vote.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Digest Number 227","postDate":"1098294159","msgId":3861,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcwMDg4NDlGLTIyQkYtMTFEOS04NEZBLTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNsNjdoNitiYnByQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNsNjdoNitiYnByQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3858,"nextInTopic":3877,"prevInTime":3860,"nextInTime":3862,"topicId":3855,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
