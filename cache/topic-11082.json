The raised garden with &quot;Mel&#39;s Mix&quot; is perfect.  We also have<br/>\nrecently started a compost bin so future gardens won&#39;t rely so much on (very<br/>\nexpensive) organic compost.  We are starting everything from seed as well<br/>\nand purchasing (very expensive) organic seed.   I grew up doing (very long)<br/>\nrows of gardening when I was a kid.  Forced to pull weeds, hoe, plant,<br/>\nwater, pick off bugs and harvest (which was my favorite part except for<br/>\nokra).  I&#39;m glad I have the knowledge that I gained from that time but can<br/>\nthink of so many other ways that I could have been inspired to want to<br/>\ngarden rather than, &quot;Get up!
