The first thing we did was go to a homeschooling conference in Sacramento, Ca. We got there and she looked around and said &quot;you mean all these kids don&#39;t go to school?&quot; Then she commented &quot;you mean there&#39;s all these workshops and things to do and none of it is required? I can do what I want ?&quot;  Camp is also like that, unless you do second session in Oregon, where they have projects to choose from. But even those I think you can not show up for if you don&#39;t want. It sounds so wonderful there. i wish i could go!<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n -------------- Original message ----------------------<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Christy Putnam&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:personal_balance@...\">personal_balance@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ~~~~ NBTSC has some kind of work trade program so if you can&#39;t afford it<br/>\n&gt; maybe you can look in to that.~~~~<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; We will look into this.
