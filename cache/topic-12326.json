I&#39;ll brainstorm to see if I can come <br/>\nup with a home-based business I might enjoy.  I am a writer; maybe <br/>\nI&#39;ll start there.  I also thought about creating Living History <br/>\nWorkshops.  I love History and think I can come up with some kind of <br/>\nfun 1/2 for kids that would be entertaining and fun, something like <br/>\na day in the life of a pioneer.  Any thoughts on that? <br/>\nRen, your absolutely right about taking on too much.  I really would <br/>\nhave to find the right mixture of kids.
