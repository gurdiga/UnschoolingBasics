And the judge will, in all likelihood, send your children to school.  I have been through a divorce and know exactly what the judge can do.  In our case, the judge tried to send our child back to school even though we both wanted homeschooling even after the divorce.  And an ex spouse can, at anytime, change his or her mind, take you BACK to court, and get the children sent to school.  Living under the heavy hand of the law is not a pleasant place to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as to finding this new partner who is going to support you in your unschooling, please remember that step children have a much higher instance of abuse.

One of the options you have available to you is to make your home a haven of peace and joy and support, a place where your kids delight in being and learning. Do fun things and go fun places, plan adventures, play games, enjoy each others time and company. You can do all of that and still have school as part of the picture. Find some school families with rich, full lives and take in what makes that possible. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to keep in mind that your kids&#39; other parent cares about them and wants what&#39;s best for them, too. It helps a whole lot to see your kids other parent as someone They love - just as you would see a game or book or movie you&#39;re not thrilled with as something your child loves, and therefore something of value. That&#39;s hard, I know.

If the other parent is willing to give up all rights over education - or at least trust your judgement on the subject, unschooling Can work in a divorce, but I haven&#39;t seen it work in any divorce where there&#39;s contention on the subject. Best case scenario is a compromise - either a school or home-education program both parents can feel okay about.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few years back I did some hunting on the legal aspect of this subject, when my partner was finalizing his divorce (after more than 10 years) and found courts favor schools over homeschooling in custody cases. You might be able to claim a psychological need for a break, if you can provide some documentation and show you&#39;re planning on having her hit the books again come fall. But unschooling is challenging even for people who are interested in unschooling to wrap their minds around - it&#39;s not going to stand much of a chance in a legal battle. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;she is the lawyer that handled my divorce case in 2007 and may not know much about educational law and in particular, unschooling<br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************<br/>\n<br/>\nThere Is no educational law where unschooling is concerned. It&#39;s a type of home education. If you&#39;re meeting the state requirements where homeschooling is concerned and can prove it, that&#39;s a good thing. If you can prove you&#39;re doing a better job than the school by school standards, then you&#39;ve probably got a chance. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, he also wants custody, which is unlikely since he is abusive.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Courts also tend to favor some measure of joint custody. Depending on how badly he abused her, you might get that pared back to visitation and if you&#39;re lucky, supervised visitation.

To give some background info., I took her out of public school this past year to unschool her.
