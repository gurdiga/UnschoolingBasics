And I said to my dh that she was needing to feel<br/>\nincluded. So simple and yet sometimes it just takes so long to get it!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then at dinner, she went around the table and asked everyone what they<br/>\nwere thankful for, without anyone prompting her to, just her idea. It was so<br/>\nsweet.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are right I have to include her in things more.

Why couldn&#39;t she help with the Thanksgiving dinner? I <br/>\nknow it can be hard to have an extra person underfoot, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink there are many things more disrespectful or frustrating for <br/>\nchildren, than being told &quot;we have to do x,y,z, you need to go play&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren want to feel like they are welcome to do all the same <br/>\nactivities the adults in their lives are doing. If she&#39;s feeling <br/>\nrejection on any level, then I&#39;m quite sure that would account for <br/>\nsome of her behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking about this from her point of view. Mommy is not as fun <br/>\nas she usually is, being large (this baby is already intruding into <br/>\nher life) and tired. The adults are sending her off to do something <br/>\nelse, she&#39;d probably like to feel important and involved. Then when <br/>\nshe acts out, everyone is looking at her with &quot;that look&quot; or being <br/>\nupset and mad at her, poor dear is utterly confused, angry and <br/>\nfeeling rejected. I&#39;d throw some fits too!!!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe she needs to feel more welcome in the adult activities?
