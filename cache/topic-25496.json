I love this! I agree with Ren, what an uplifting post - <br/>\nthanks :) <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine <br/>\n(TCM), breaking glass is a really beneficial activity. Everything <br/>\nabout it - the action of throwing or smashing, the sound of the glass <br/>\nbreaking, allowing the &quot;chaos&quot; to flow, and taking responsibility for <br/>\nthe actions by cleaning up the broken glass so that no one is harmed <br/>\nby it - these are all extremely beneficial for the liver meridian, <br/>\nwhich is the organ that governs/relates to anger. (Breaking green <br/>\nglass is particularly recommended, as green is the color related to <br/>\nliver.) My TCM doctor and Qi gong teacher regularly &quot;prescribes&quot; <br/>\nbreaking glass to his students and patients. (Throwing eggs is also <br/>\ngood for the liver.) So good for you for helping facilitate your <br/>\nchild&#39;s need! Kids are so beautifully self-regulating!
