We go to Charleston for the day. Or Camden. Or Charlotte. <br/>\nAll are a bit of a drive, so we get that car-talking time in (which is <br/>\ngood for jump-starting other possibilities) and (when we get there) <br/>\nsome sight-seeing in and walking and inspiration---and lots of art, <br/>\narchitecture, and history.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a great place very nearby called the Congaree National <br/>\nSwamp---a boardwalk built through a swamp---absolutely beautiful, with <br/>\nall kinds of critters to hunt for. I have friends who have seen wild <br/>\nboar there, but we haven&#39;t yet---got my eyes peeled though! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBringing a friend over for an extended stay is helpful. Bo&#39;s here now. <br/>\nHe&#39;ll stay for a week. That always livens things up a bit. Visiting <br/>\nfriends too: Duncan will be flying up to Boston to visit Shaun next <br/>\nmonth (his first solo flight! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, when it seemed that we are stuck in the house too much, I <br/>\nasked Duncan whether there was anything he especially wanted to <br/>\nDO---active-wise. He surprised me by saying tennis. So I got him (and <br/>\nCameron) a few lessons with the local pro, and he and Cameron like to <br/>\ngo down and hit a few balls around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf *I* am feeling that we&#39;re not doing enough, chances are we aren&#39;t. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt; There are times I feel we&#39;re in a rut---and *I* can get VERY <br/>\ncomfortable in a rut. &lt;G&gt; At those times, I need to push myself to get <br/>\nout and do. But once that ball is rollling,....<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, if we&#39;ve been going and going and going, it can be <br/>\nreally nice to just hunker down and enjoy NOT doing for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nSooo, to *me*, if you feel that you need to be doing more, the solution <br/>\nis probably to do more. And maybe not more of the same thing, but <br/>\nsomething *different*.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":328141476,"authorName":"Adrean Clark","from":"&quot;Adrean Clark&quot; &lt;adreanaline@...&gt;","profile":"fuzzyellowduck","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Failing WAS: unschooling and taking classes","postDate":"1208804279","msgId":31967,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQwZGQzNGUzMDgwNDIxMTE1N3UxODcxZTczMm4xNGMxYzA4MWRiOGY1MjY4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDQTZEOUUzMkVERkFDRi1FNTAtMTU3RkBXZWJtYWlsLW1nMDEuc2ltLmFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGZ0cjVxdCtuYzcwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDhDQTZBRkFCNTYyRTFGNS1FRTAtMzAwNkBXRUJNQUlMLURHMDguc2ltLmFvbC5jb20+CSA8ZDBkZDM0ZTMwODA0MTMxMDU3aDNlMzZiZTE1aTE5MzIwMWY0NDgzM2Q4YzRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8OENBNkQ5RTMyRURGQUNGLUU1MC0xNTdGQFdlYm1haWwtbWcwMS5zaW0uYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":31885,"nextInTopic":31984,"prevInTime":31966,"nextInTime":31968,"topicId":31815,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry it took me so long to reply.

The <br/>\nprogram can be just about anything from very structured to very open <br/>\nended. We also just wait and see what other families come up with and <br/>\ntry things out to see if we have interest. Each family offers a program <br/>\nor contributes in some other way each session(3 a year)- this is the end <br/>\nof the third year. It is in no way an easy way out- I have personally <br/>\ndevoted a huge amount of time to organizing, scheduling, preparing for <br/>\nactivities, meetings, etc. My daughter loves to lead craft activities <br/>\nwith me so we do this often- she loves sharing skills with other kids. <br/>\nMy son mainly likes sports and hanging out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of the things that we do at the learning center are things that <br/>\naren&#39;t aren&#39;t as much fun(in our opinion) with three: basketball, <br/>\nsoccer, cooperative games, group games, dancing, board games, card <br/>\ngames, general playing outdoors. My kids have also been introduced to <br/>\nsome stuff by people who are truly excited about what they are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids do some things that they are interested in outside of the <br/>\nlearning center, other times they are just trying something that sounds <br/>\ninteresting- and sometimes it isn&#39;t, sometimes it is. They both really <br/>\nlove being out of the house and seeing other people- and this was <br/>\ndifficult for me to arrange enough of without the learning center, <br/>\nthough I tried and tried. Many families just weren&#39;t open to getting <br/>\ntogether often. In fact, I think my older child is likely to have <br/>\nattended public school if it weren&#39;t for the learning center. We could <br/>\ncertainly arrange other group things outside of this institution and do <br/>\nbut since most home schooled kids in the area attend and my kids want to <br/>\nbe with them often, we want to be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly my children might find themselves being coerced by another <br/>\nparent/leader. We read the descriptions carefully and avoid situations <br/>\nthat seem uncomfortable, and drop out of others that become <br/>\nuncomfortable, which is rare.<br/>\n <br/>\nJust my experience- don&#39;t know what your friend&#39;s is.  Classes or <br/>\nlearning coops that aren&#39;t organized by parents of course don&#39;t take as <br/>\nmuch effort- and their are many members of our own center that don&#39;t out <br/>\nmuch into it and use it in a very different way. I run into a lot of <br/>\npeople who have a very different definition of unschooling than I do- I <br/>\ncan feel a bit annoyed by that- but I don&#39;t own the word, after all. <br/>\nPeople say they unschool and force their children to work in a math book <br/>\nor are just so negative and disappointed about their children that even <br/>\nif they call it unschooling it isn&#39;t anything I recognize as such.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce an unschooling kid chooses to go to school- are they no longer <br/>\nunschooling? Once an unschooling kid chooses to take a lot of <br/>\nschool-like classes or buys some text books are they no longer <br/>\nunschooling? Maybe the parent in either case is not able to provide an <br/>\nunschooling life without these experiences that is satisfying- or maybe <br/>\nthis is what the child truly wants to experience of all that is out <br/>\nthere- you&#39;d have to look pretty close to tell. I would think this would <br/>\nmainly be important to determine about yourself and your own children. <br/>\nSome people really really want to experience group learning or are <br/>\nwilling to put up with the group learning to experience what they love <br/>\nabout the greater experience of being at school or other type of class. <br/>\nI have to face the fact that I am humanly unable to provide my children <br/>\nwith all experiences possible or even all that they desire- due to where <br/>\nwe live, our income level, other people&#39;s willingness and availability. <br/>\nWe can try and try harder, but there are limits though we work very hard <br/>\nat letting go of any arbitrary and invented ones.

It really depends on the kids though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like the idea of forcing the kids to do anything---and even if <br/>\nthe parents aren&#39;t forcing the kids to these classes, my guess is that <br/>\nthe children feel coercion from the &quot;teachers&quot; in some way.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how can you tell if it is an unschooler who loves the classes or<br/>\nif it is an ecclectic homeschooling  with co-op?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it doesn&#39;t really matter. &lt;g&gt; Do we really need to tell? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if they choose<br/>\nto go but show no other interest in the subject outside of the class?<br/>\nWhat if they would not be going if all of their friends were not<br/>\ngoing too?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThen *I* think the parents aren&#39;t working hard enough. &lt;bwg&gt; All that <br/>\ncan be accomplished withOUT classes and co-ops. Certainly getting the <br/>\nkids together often can be accomplished without classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you know, sometimes it IS what the kids want. Sometimes mom&#39;s not <br/>\nfeeling up to the job, and it may be the children&#39;s best option. <br/>\nSometimes children just like group dynamics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s good for unschoolers to place more value on <br/>\norganized classes and co-ops than on tv and games and playing in mud.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":241586873,"authorName":"barefootmamax4","from":"&quot;barefootmamax4&quot; &lt;barefootmamax4@...&gt;","profile":"barefootmamax4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: unschooling and taking classes","postDate":"1208032393","msgId":31825,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ0cjZhOStjYmIzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ0cWZyZSszczk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31824,"nextInTopic":31826,"prevInTime":31824,"nextInTime":31826,"topicId":31815,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I also know another unschooling family (in the same co-op group) that is working on trying to get use of an unused school building for holding classes and use","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1533034354\">I also know another unschooling family (in the same co-op group) that <br/>\nis working on trying to get use of an unused school building for <br/>\nholding classes and use if the gym.

She used the model of a <br/>\nSudbury school,free school. I am thinking that despite it&#39;s freedom for <br/>\nchildren to choose what classes to to take ,it is still a school, <br/>\nseparating learning from real life through classes.

It&#39;s not like the <br/>\nkid had an interest in woodcrafting or art so the parents set up an <br/>\nart class to help the kid follow thier own intersest. It&#39;s more like <br/>\nthe Seaport is offering classes once on month on these various <br/>\nsubjects (immigration, navigation, force and motion) and all the <br/>\nlocal homeschoolers take them,so my friend does too. They do they <br/>\nwork of the class because that is what everybody is doing, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t see her daughter just coming out with &quot;Hey, I want to study <br/>\nimmigration, is there a class for that?&quot; I suppose it could be being <br/>\npresented as the mom showing the kids all the classes available and <br/>\nasking if they want to take them. In that case  would the only <br/>\ndifference would be parental suggestion and not really following a <br/>\nparticular interest that was there first? Would this just be exposing <br/>\nthem to more of the world?  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is she calling the kids unschoolers?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, that is why I&#39;m trying to figure this out. She defines the term <br/>\nunschooling as they don&#39;t buy a curriculum or do a school at home. I <br/>\nam wondering about driving from class to class though. They are going <br/>\nsomewhere every day. I am trying to pin down the exact difference <br/>\nbetween using a class in a unschooling manner or using the class as   <br/>\ncurriculum (expensive tutoring) aren&#39;t you just paying someone else <br/>\nto teach you kids?

There is a nature science class,book club, <br/>\nchess club,Seaport(history), sports and Spanish currently being <br/>\noffered. It is true that the classes are hands on and we have done a <br/>\nfew of them, but we don&#39;t do all of the session or use it as a <br/>\ncurriculum. For example the Seaport had a class at the planetarium.At <br/>\nthe time we had just gotten a telescope and were learning to use it <br/>\nso the kids really wanted to do this one. Shortly after they lost <br/>\ninterest .<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Both of my boys have taken a class or two---and I know several <br/>\n&gt; unschoolers who LOVE co-op classes and other &quot;organized&quot; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>educational <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; stuff.

Many members use it as school, though <br/>\nwe and several other families unschool and treat it like anything else <br/>\nwe would offer our children- totally up to them day by day. We tend to <br/>\nsign up for sports, games, and art programs as that is what my kids are <br/>\ninterested in though they have also enjoyed some writing and science <br/>\nclasses at their own choice. It is a challenge to co-exist with the <br/>\nschool-at -home families but the kids love to be with the other kids and <br/>\nas long as I don&#39;t expect too much out of relationships with the other <br/>\nparents it is okay. My kids love it so much and feel very sad when there <br/>\nis a break between sessions (which is one school-like things about it <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t work so well for us.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have organized some meetings of a unschooling group at the center - <br/>\nthe interest is growing. I think having us be there and be confident in <br/>\nour choices really helps other families see unschooling as a viable <br/>\noption. I think there is a lot of pressure and contagious fear about <br/>\nmeeting state requirements that spreads among parents- especially those <br/>\nwith young children. Many families have joined specifically so that they <br/>\ncan use the classes at the learning center as a substitute for following <br/>\ncurriculum at home. Such a fearful way to live! I do see that our <br/>\nexcitement in following our own interests in learning and living can be <br/>\ncontagious also.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather M.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: barefootmamax4 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:barefootmamax4@...\">barefootmamax4@...</a> <br/>\n&gt; &lt;mailto:barefootmamax4%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a friend who does not purchase curriculum ,but they do take a<br/>\n&gt; lot of hands on classes for homeschoolers.
