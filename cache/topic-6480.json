It has been  difficult for <br/>\nus all but we are starting to feel connected with our new  community. I have <br/>\na 16 year old (tomorrow) daughter and a 12 year old son.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome things that seem to be helping:<br/>\n <br/>\nWe found a robotics club that meets at a science museum weekly.  It  has both <br/>\nhomeschoolers and schooled kids but most are boys my son&#39;s age that  share <br/>\nhis interest in robotics.  Just that once a week thing has given him  something <br/>\nnew to look forward to.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe is very interested in rock and gem collecting.  Florida was mostly  sand <br/>\nso he has been very excited to discover all the possibilities of finding  <br/>\ntreasures here in New Mexico.  We have visited rock shops, found books on  <br/>\ncollecting at local used book stores and gone out hiking and looking for rocks.  It&#39;s <br/>\nkept him busy and that has helped with this transistion of not having his  <br/>\ncousin to play with every day. I imagine it will lead to meeting some new people  <br/>\nas some of the rock shops have classes geared towards kids.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;re meeting up with a teen homeschooling group today to play games.   The <br/>\nkids are a bit older but interested in gaming which is an interest he shares  <br/>\nand as homeschoolers they don&#39;t seem too concerned that his is  younger.   <br/>\n <br/>\nIn general, I think the best connections with older kids come through their  <br/>\ninterests.  I&#39;d suggest just doing and seeing anything that might spark an  <br/>\ninterest. Go new places, eat at new restaurants, try cooking new foods.   What <br/>\ndoes he love to do?  What does he like to watch on TV?  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m happiest at home but I&#39;m trying to push myself to get out each day with  <br/>\none or both kids even if it&#39;s to go to a new grocery store or thrift shop  or <br/>\nlibrary.  The more you do, the greater the opportunities for meeting new  <br/>\npeople and you&#39;ll be having fun at the same time.<br/>\n <br/>\nGail<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":186995749,"authorName":"Mary Cimo","from":"Mary Cimo &lt;mary_cimo@...&gt;","profile":"mary_cimo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Loneliness","postDate":"1126015587","msgId":6486,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwOTA2MTQwNjI3LjUxNjQ1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUwMDE1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTcwMWM1YjJkMyQ5ODk3MTk1MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBob21lPg=="},"prevInTopic":6484,"nextInTopic":6487,"prevInTime":6485,"nextInTime":6487,"topicId":6480,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We re in Las Vegas. ... __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?
