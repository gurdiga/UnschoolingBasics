So I just say, &quot;They&#39;re <br/>\nopposites in most ways,&quot; and let them figure it out from there using <br/>\ntheir own observations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it drives me nuts when my mom compares my sister to me <br/>\n(unfavorably) always in the context of how smart I am or how I read so <br/>\nmuch (and learned how so early) and such. We&#39;re 1/2 sisters 17 years <br/>\napart! Of course we&#39;re different.

There is nothing wrong <br/>\nwith being a specialist. The important thing is to be true to yourself, <br/>\ndo what you love, and love what you do. Here&#39;s an excerpt from a cool <br/>\narticle in the washington post about happiness and flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who has slogged through a dead-end job counting the hours until <br/>\nquittin&#39; time already knows that the right job is a big part of <br/>\nday-to-day happiness. But finding good, meaningful work -- what Haidt <br/>\nrefers to as a &quot;calling&quot; -- is easier said than done. (That&#39;s why they <br/>\ncall it work, Grasshopper.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;People often think &#39;I&#39;ll be happy when,&#39; &quot; says Pete Cohen, a life <br/>\ncoach and co-author of &quot;Feeling Good for No Good Reason&quot; (How To Books, <br/>\n1999). But then we get whatever it is we&#39;re chasing -- a raise, a <br/>\npromotion, a good solid kick of the pigskin -- and it turns out we <br/>\nnever really find joie de vivre.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key is to tap into what Hungarian-born psychologist Mihaly <br/>\nCsikszentmihalyi describes in his book &quot;Flow: The Psychology of Optimal <br/>\nExperience&quot; (Harper & Row, 1990) as the total immersion that happens <br/>\nwhen &quot;people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to <br/>\nmatter.&quot; Instead of focusing on the destination, we&#39;d do better to <br/>\nenjoy the journey -- the work that leads to the raise rather than the <br/>\nraise itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot a 9-to-5 type? Don&#39;t fret. Debbie Gisonni, author of &quot;The Goddess <br/>\nof Happiness (Inner Ocean Publishing, 2005), recommends thinking back <br/>\nto childhood and remembering the things that made you happy then. Maybe <br/>\nyour pathway to &quot;flow&quot; is raising kids, painting murals, singing in the <br/>\nchurch choir -- anything that plays to your strengths and is rewarding <br/>\nfor its own sake, rather than for the end goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vijay<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"breaking news; doubt rears it&#39;s ugly head in CT","postDate":"1151442192","msgId":15001,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU3czZlZytrOG4yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15000,"nextInTopic":15006,"prevInTime":15000,"nextInTime":15002,"topicId":14975,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~So - he s been feeling guilty and awful about himself for being fickle.

I still don&#39;t equate that with &quot;spoiled&quot; or &quot;out-of-control&quot;<br/>\nthough.
