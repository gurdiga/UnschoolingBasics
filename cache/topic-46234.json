She has applied for graduate school in library and information sciences.<br/>\n<br/>\nJJ<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. Another teen-unschooler story I can offer is about her, although I wrote it up when she was only 14. Maybe Rose&#39;s kids wqould like it too; Sandra Dodd did. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/s/backstage\">http://sandradodd.com/s/backstage</a><br/>\n&quot;As DD tells it, someone mentioned what a brat one of the youngest dancers was, what a pain, why didn&#39;t her parents make her behave better, be quieter and less of a prima donna. DD helps work with the younger ones and knows them pretty well, so she said oh, no, really they&#39;re all great kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral of the others turned on her and said not this one, this one needs lots more discipline, her parents spank her but apparently not hard enough or often enough (shocking the few who it seems, like DD, had never been spanked or slapped or even given a &#39;time-out&#39;). . . &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Rose&quot; &lt;rosefurney1111@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is from another list I&#39;m on.
