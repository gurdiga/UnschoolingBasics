Although true in a way, it&#39;s NOT true in the way that<br/>\nthe proponents are trying to make it look.  Yes, when you have a job (for<br/>\nexample), you have a boss.  But you are *choosing* to have that job,<br/>\ntherefore *choosing* to have that boss.  You can do any number of things to<br/>\nget out of a boss situation which you no longer wish to have.  Children<br/>\ndon&#39;t have this option.  Stella doesn&#39;t have the option to say, &quot;I&#39;m going<br/>\nto find a new family that respects me.&quot;  She&#39;s stuck with the one she&#39;s got<br/>\n(at least for a number of years yet).  That, to me, is a world of<br/>\ndifference.  It&#39;s like trying to compare a job that you choose in the &quot;real<br/>\nworld&quot; with jail.

To answer a few","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-793791530\">My friend wrote me this in an email discussion about how her daughter<br/>\nscreams all morning before they leave the house about her clothes. To answer<br/>\na few questions first... She is not an unschooler, not even a homeschooler,<br/>\nbut she comes to me for advice and I can&#39;t help but to advocate for her<br/>\ndaughter. I watch her daughter while my friend works. Stella is 3 1/2. Oh,<br/>\nand she is sensory sensitive, but even that seems better when she is at my<br/>\nhouse than when she is with her mom.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\nWhere do you draw the line?  I honestly think it&#39;s a control thing.  She<br/>\ndoes have to learn that there are times when there will be authority...<br/>\nEveryone has bosses.<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you respond to that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t sent the email yet, but I wrote...<br/>\n<br/>\n*I don&#39;t draw the line. I don&#39;t even pick up the stick.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course it is a control thing. You are trying to control her. Probably<br/>\nbecause your parents tried to control you. Probably because that is what<br/>\nmainstream society says is right. It&#39;s not. What right do YOU have to<br/>\ncontrol HER? Would you like it if Dave said some of the things to you that<br/>\nyou say to her? How would this scenario go over in your house...<br/>\n<br/>\nDave walks into the bedroom in the morning and you are pulling out clothes<br/>\nfrom the closet to wear for the day. He tells you that you can&#39;t pick out<br/>\nnew clothes. You already picked out clothes last night. You HAVE to wear the<br/>\nclothes you picked out last night. This is non-negotiable.*<br/>\n<br/>\nI am pretty confident with those answers but not sure how to approach the<br/>\nthing about &quot;everyone has bosses&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I wonder if it is pointless to even be discussing this with her.<br/>\nMaybe I shouldn&#39;t, but we have been watching Stella for nearly 2 years now.<br/>\nShe is part of our family and I feel like I need to stand up for her.<br/>\nAdvocate for her like I would my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry to come to you folks with things like this. I find myself often<br/>\n(like every time we leave the house or every time my friend emails me with a<br/>\nproblem like this or every time I talk to my SIL, etc) getting aggravated by<br/>\nthe way they treat their children and feeling like I need to say something.<br/>\nMost of the time I leave it alone, but then I feel like I am doing a<br/>\ndisservice to their children. So silly. I want the whole world to see things<br/>\nfrom their children&#39;s point of view which I am pretty good at arguing.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAmanda<br/>\nWife to Roger (together 10 years)<br/>\nMum to Marti (7.5) and Lilly (4)<br/>\nBabysitter to Stella (3.5)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/\">http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What you give to your children enriches them.
