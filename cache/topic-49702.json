I *was* uncomfortable at the parties but I&#39;m an introvert so that pretty much goes without saying. ;-) The focus at parties wasn&#39;t on each other. It was on the activities, food, opening presents. In fact it felt uncomfortable when there were kids who knew each other because they&#39;d form comfortable groups that left others out. I at least felt connect with others in our lack of knowing others ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have activities planned they shouldn&#39;t be wandering off to play Minecraft. Unless the point of the party is to get together to play Minecraft. If they are all MInecrafters, there might be physical games you could play, like collect loads of cardboard boxes and create something together out of it. I&#39;m sure there are ideas on the internet from clever Moms :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; invite the kids from the two next door houses and get to know them<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Parties -- especially for kids -- aren&#39;t a great way to get to know people. It&#39;s more about entertainment than each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d invite them over maybe for some specific activity. Like building things with the boxes :-) Or Nerf play. Or decorating cookies.
