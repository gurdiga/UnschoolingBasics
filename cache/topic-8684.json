My","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2082935858\">Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am in UK, and have been broadly following the unschooling <br/>\nprinciple for 4 years with my 12 yo ds.  I have a 22 yo son who was <br/>\nnot homeschooled.  My husband sort of gets it, my eldest son is <br/>\noblivious which is to be expected.... but my husband&#39;s eyes glaze <br/>\nover when I have tried to explain some of the reasons behind the <br/>\nunschooling way, including chores.  DH is fairly laid back anyway, <br/>\nso his attitude is fine, and lets me &#39;get on with it my way&#39;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has a business which keeps him occupied, and he sees the results <br/>\nof my not following a rigid plan, and allowing ds to join in chores <br/>\nas and when they affect him.  It isnt easy for men to manage the <br/>\neveryday chores, even my eldest son admits to being able to cook, <br/>\nbut not get all the food out piping hot on a plate.... I do believe <br/>\nthey come from another planet you know (LOL)!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nI do feel for you at this time, with a new babe, and feeling rotten <br/>\nwith a cold.  It isnt easy to get your husband on board with your <br/>\nplans in your vulnerable state at present...you need to muster your <br/>\nenergy to be patient with your man, but most of all be patient with <br/>\nyourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isnt the best of ways, but it has worked for me....sometimes at <br/>\nhome we &#39;do what is expected from dh when he is around&#39; and &#39;carry <br/>\non with what we normally do when dh is at work&#39; the rest of the <br/>\ntime.  My son realises that tension can evaporate if we all muddle <br/>\nand muck in together to help with the chores so that we  can <br/>\nall &#39;have a sit down or space to follow our particular hobbies&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps with all the extra things your husband has taken on board, <br/>\nhe feels a bit cornered into trying to understand the unschooling <br/>\nway of doing things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my main concerns over the past few years has been to explain <br/>\nto my eldest son things that happened when he was young, that <br/>\nthankfully, since seeing the light, I dont do with my young son.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe went to school, was made to do homework, made to go to bed at a <br/>\nregular time, made to take up some form of interest or hobby or <br/>\nmusic, etc. (head hung in shame here....and I have smacked him and <br/>\npunished him) made him eat meals he didnt like &#39;for his own good&#39;, <br/>\netc. etc.  I cant believe how far I have come, since my son was <br/>\nbullied at school, and I extracted him from the state system.....and <br/>\nthankfully found the Unschooling.com site.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings will change, gradually at first....there is a book especially <br/>\nfor us wives/partners to read about husbands taking a greater role <br/>\nin child rearing and housework.  I will have to go look it up, and <br/>\nwill post here it soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, someone more experienced on this site will be able to <br/>\noffer some tips for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes...Sonia in England    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Message: 6<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   Date: Mon, 02 Jan 2006 04:34:03 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;multimomma&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:autismhelp@...\">autismhelp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Can I vent here? (long post w/ ?)<br/>\n <br/>\nI know I&#39;m new to all this, but I&#39;m trying hard. My hubby, however, <br/>\nis not. He is (sorta) okay<br/>\nwith the not schooling on purpose (he probably thinks it&#39;s a phase), <br/>\nbut everything else.<br/>\nUgh, I can&#39;t even begin to describe it, and maybe it&#39;s just newbaby <br/>\nhormones, but it<br/>\nhonestly seems like he&#39;s trying to make things *harder* for me! When <br/>\nI talked to him about<br/>\nnot forcing the kids to do chores, etc, he kind of laughed it off <br/>\nand said that he&#39;ll see how<br/>\nlong I last. I mean, I thought he understood all the lead up, agreed <br/>\nwhen we talked about<br/>\nhow when WE do chores we don&#39;t think twice about sitting down to <br/>\nrest or grabbing a soda<br/>\nor whatever. Every time I turned around today, he did something that <br/>\nhe totally would not<br/>\nhave done before though. Including hiding all the game pieces that <br/>\nwere accidentally left<br/>\nout when the kids (voluntarily!) cleaned up their games. His pet <br/>\npeeve is that he&#39;s a<br/>\nworkaholic (Iike me) but wants everyone else to bust their butts <br/>\nworking all the time<br/>\n(unlike me).<br/>\n <br/>\nI can deal with the kids, but I&#39;m about to kill my husband. I was <br/>\ngoing to talk to him<br/>\ntonight, but I think I need to rationally think for a day or two, <br/>\nand get advice from other<br/>\nparents who had to deal with partners who didn&#39;t back them up. (or <br/>\nmaybe purposefully<br/>\nsabotaged!) I&#39;m so tired anyway, I don&#39;t need this kind of crap. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t understand why he<br/>\nwas willing to split housework 50/50 before the kids were able to <br/>\nhelp, but isn&#39;t willing to<br/>\ndo it now. It&#39;s like his job is to make sure the kids do all the <br/>\nwork. grrr! Considering how<br/>\nmuch work they did when I was on bedrest, and they&#39;re still so young.<br/>\n <br/>\nDoes this make sense? I know it&#39;s late and I&#39;m still not asleep, AND <br/>\nI have a cold, so maybe<br/>\nI&#39;m not making sense. I just know that I&#39;m mad enough to lay in bed <br/>\nand stew, so I wanted<br/>\nto come and post here just to get it off my chest and see if someone <br/>\nhas some advice for<br/>\nme. I know it&#39;s hard on dh, I get frustrated too. Throughout this <br/>\npregnancy things have<br/>\nchanged significantly in our lives, our relationship with each <br/>\nother, with the kids, etc. He&#39;s<br/>\nhad to take on a lot of roles that I&#39;ve covered since marriage (Ha! <br/>\nI did everything until the<br/>\nbedrest, housework, yard work, car maintainance, bills, therapy, <br/>\nschoolwork) In less than<br/>\nnine months, he&#39;s doing much of this, we started homeschooling, I&#39;ve <br/>\nchanged my<br/>\nparenting, but doesn&#39;t it seem that he should be able to roll with <br/>\nthe punches? I&#39;m not<br/>\nasking him to do more work, just support me as I take on more. Or at <br/>\nleast be respectful<br/>\nof the what the kids do, and when they do it.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for listening, I hope this was ok to post such a long vent, I <br/>\nthink I&#39;ll go back and<br/>\nput that in my subject line as a warning!!!<br/>\n <br/>\nmelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8634,"nextTopicId":8683}}
