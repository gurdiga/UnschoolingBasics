Sometimes it feels that way -- his needs are pretty intense these days, and if they aren&#39;t met then some of the basic needs of the rest of the family aren&#39;t met either like safety of self and possessions.  The four year old did receive some comforting and explanation, but not until later by which point he&#39;d moved on to other things anyway.  Today the 4yo explained that he was afraid the castle would get hurt when he wasn&#39;t playing with, although he quickly acknowledged that he didn&#39;t think the 7yo would hurt it because the 7yo likes playing with it.  Not convinced that that was really what was going through 4yo&#39;s mind the other day though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any new suggestions from your own experience, I&#39;d love to hear them on or off list.  It&#39;s quite likely that both of my older boys are diagnosable on the autism spectrum, but we&#39;ve never gone that route.  Oldest is happy, focused, productive just highly energetic, impulsive, and socially immature.  Middle is more of a concern to me because of both the anger and the underlying sense that he&#39;s not really happy (although that&#39;s seeming better to me recently) -- he&#39;s also *really* shy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Melissa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:autismhelp@...\">autismhelp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 8, 2007 11:13:00 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: problem<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n            Can I ask a question (okay, a couple of questions)? &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask not because I&#39;m trying to be snotty, but because it sounds familiar. &lt;snip&gt;I&#39;ve also quite a bit of experience helping other families with extreme <br/>\n<br/>\nbehaviors, due to my position in the autism society.

I&#39;d read parts before, but I recently read Ross Greene&#39;s The Explosive Child completely and surprised myself by how much I appreciated his description of the different routes that can lead to inflexible-explosive reactions.  He really emphasized how important it can be to know which routes are causing a problem for your child.  Depending on the route you might respond in different ways to help minimize their frustration.  The therapist may be able to model different ways of approaching issues that I wouldn&#39;t think of in their interaction with my child.  Plus, while I know my child better than anyone else, my ability to describe that child so that they have a good image is not as effective as actually meeting him.

The reason for putting the castle away was because the fights get physical.  Actually, from a physical standpoint, they&#39;re more attacks than fights -- very one-sided.  This was the second biggie in the 24 hours since the castle had been opened.  What I told them was that we needed to put the castle away until we could figure out how we could play with it without anyone&#39;s getting hurt.  But I knew that during &quot;Quiet Time&quot; (which I explained in response to another post) the 4yo could play with his gift safely.  He was getting bitten (or would have if dh hadn&#39;t pulled 7yo off) *and* losing his present (for a little while -- but I knew it seemed forever in his mind).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t really happy with my putting the castle up but I didn&#39;t see a whole lot of in-the-moment alternatives -- which is why I posted.

There&#39;s no question that almost all of his anger is directed toward his younger brother, although he does have a low frustration level in general.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb:  If he got cool stuff for his fourth birthday could you show him those <br/>\n<br/>\npictures? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:   Hadn&#39;t thought of that.  Might help, though I&#39;m pretty sure that in his mind the castle/knights are the coolest thing that any of them have ever gotten.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb:  Can you spend time with him alone, going places and doing things he loves?  Can you find some time to be with only him during the day, every day,  and <br/>\n<br/>\nin that time talk about when he was born or when he was little and all the <br/>\n<br/>\ncute things he did and how much you loved being with him? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  We&#39;ve been trying to do more of this.  Doesn&#39;t sound very &quot;unschooly&quot; but we started having an afternoon &quot;Quiet Time&quot; a couple months ago, where each of the boys goes to a separate room with whatever toys he chooses and I cycle through and spend 20-30 minutes with each of them alone.  (Can&#39;t safely leave the younger two together unsupervised, so has to be each to his own space.)  The boys all love the time alone with me and the older two love the time by themselves as well; the younger one sometimes needs to come and play in the same  room when I&#39;m with the oldest.  We&#39;ve also been trying to have occasional &quot;dates&quot; with child and either dh or myself -- but the boys (including 7yo) also want to play D&D when dh is home so it&#39;s a bit of a balancing act.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb:  Can you get him a castle too?   Or, if that&#39;s not possible, could you pull <br/>\n<br/>\nthe castle out at nights when the four year old is asleep, so there&#39;s no <br/>\n<br/>\ncompetition, and just hang out with him and play with the castle <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  I did ask if he&#39;d like to use some of his money (he has plenty and no plans for saving it for something in particular) to buy some of his own knights or suggested we could build another castle, but he wasn&#39;t interested.  It&#39;s more about the first one&#39;s &quot;belonging&quot; to the little one (although all the toys are shared and in common space).  Actually, a friend just loaned us a Playmobile-like castle and pirate set thinking that might help diffuse the initial intensity over the birthday castle.  We&#39;ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at pictures and talking about when he was four is a good idea.  I do think he still feels displaced, and I think having the younger now be at an age where he wants to play with the others has made it even more difficult.  He&#39;s not only displaced, but he has a rival for toys and for the oldest brother&#39;s attention as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the thoughts,<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nEveryone is raving about the all-new Yahoo!

And I suppose there are also some that <br/>\nare willing to talk to a doctor about these things.  But knowing my <br/>\ndaughter, I knew that a doctor would be distinctly unhelpful and, as <br/>\nDanielle suggested, send her wrong messages about herself.  When she <br/>\nwas 7, she was just not able to talk about her rages.  She just <br/>\ncould not access those feelings when they weren&#39;t there, and when <br/>\nthey were, she was so full of them that she could hardly talk at <br/>\nall.

Food allergies have made a big difference in our household. In <br/>\naddition, finding replacements has been very important to us in terms of RU, because we <br/>\nwant our kids with allergies to have as many choices as our children without. We tried to have <br/>\nan allergen free home, but that wasn&#39;t fair to our other kids. It&#39;s a crazy balance! We did a <br/>\ntotal wheat-free and casein-free diet with our daughter, but in the long run, it was corn. Not <br/>\njust corn syrup, but corn meal, corn starch, dextrose, any sweetner with a corn base. Lovely. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are two different children in Breanna, one with corn and one without. They are <br/>\ncomplete and total opposites, and for the most part, once she was used to living without corn <br/>\nsyrup, she is happy not to have it.

To say that my 7yo, whose <br/>\nfrustration threshold is extremely low, is beside himself with jealousy is a gross <br/>\nunderstatement.  Yesterday I had to call dh home from work to help because he was so <br/>\nfurious (and it was lunchtime and I was expecting AAA to show up to tow the van any <br/>\nmoment).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This morning while I was in the shower something happened, I don&#39;t know what, but dh <br/>\nsent 10yo to get me and when I went down 7yo was shredding newsprint, kicking and <br/>\nscreaming at dh while 4yo was hovering anxiously over castle.  Now, an hour later, we&#39;ve <br/>\nput the castle in hiding although not before 7yo grabbed most of the figures (which he still <br/>\nhas).  So far I&#39;ve said that 4yo can have the castle (since it was his gift) later when 7yo <br/>\nwon&#39;t be here -- not to punish 7yo but to keep 4yo safe.  I also said that I want the castle <br/>\nto be something that brings joy and happiness and fun to our family and that we need to <br/>\nfigure out how we can play with it so that that happens before we bring it back out.  I also <br/>\nspent a long time sitting with 7yo, comforting and offering kisses and lots of reflective <br/>\nlistening.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At the moment I&#39;m thinking the castle simply has to be away unless an adult (or possibly <br/>\nonly a mommy) is available to supervise, because safety is a priority.  But I&#39;d love any other <br/>\nor additional suggestions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh, and yes, we know we need additional help with 7yo&#39;s anger.

It&#39;s a really heart-wrenching place <br/>\nto be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like your husband is really available and willing to help <br/>\nout--that&#39;s wonderful! I know we do so much better when dh is really <br/>\naround and available to spend time with Sam, and having that extra adult <br/>\nis invaluable! (Although sometimes Jim adds his own layer of issues. *g*)<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you be willing to offer more details? Because at face value, <br/>\nshredding newspaper doesn&#39;t sound like a bad thing to me; in fact, it&#39;s <br/>\na strategy we tried for a while to see if it helped release some of <br/>\nSam&#39;s anger. I know of other parents who&#39;ve successfully found a <br/>\n&quot;breaking place&quot; where the child could go and smash things like old <br/>\nchina from garage sales or bang things with hammers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose kinds of things have never really worked for Sam--he&#39;s just not <br/>\ninterested in redirecting his anger energy in that way. What we&#39;ve found <br/>\nto be most successful is finding a safe place where he can simply vent <br/>\nin his own in-the-moment way. I&#39;ve had to learn over the years how to be <br/>\npresent and calm for him while he&#39;s venting, allowing his anger to flow <br/>\naround me without taking it personally or trying to stop it. I&#39;ve found <br/>\nthat when I directly engage his energy with my own, that the situation <br/>\nescalates and spirals out of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nVisualization has worked really well as a tool for me. I try to sit, <br/>\nclose my eyes and imagine myself as a mountain of calm. Sam gets to a <br/>\nspace where verbalization--trying to talk to him, to rationalize with <br/>\nhim, to even validate him--is impossible. But, if I simply work at being <br/>\npresent without talking, without expecting resolution, just being a <br/>\ncalm, loving, available presence for him, he will move through his rage <br/>\nand get to a place where he can begin to process it. And with several <br/>\nyears of doing this, and him trusting that I will be there and trusting <br/>\nthat I am his partner in his process, I can honestly see a *huge* <br/>\ndifference from where we were three years ago. Part of that, certainly, <br/>\nis age, but there&#39;s a huge part of it that is Sam&#39;s trust in the process <br/>\nand trust that he *can* handle the incredibly intense emotions raging <br/>\nthrough his body, that *I* can handle those incredibly intense emotions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are absolutely times when this gets *exhausting*, and it&#39;s really, <br/>\nreally important that I keep up my own personal reserves and energy to <br/>\nbe available to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, too, is only one side of the process--the part that has to do with <br/>\nhow to handle situations once they&#39;ve gotten to this stage. There&#39;s a <br/>\nwhole &#39;nother, larger part of the process that has to do with <br/>\n*preventing* the escalation and *cultivating* calming and coping <br/>\nstrategies for dealing with and dissipating intense emotion as it&#39;s <br/>\nmounting. I also highly recommend what I call an &quot;autonomy inventory,&quot; <br/>\nwhich is an observational list of all the ways your guy is empowered/ <br/>\ndisempowered during his day. Not just the things he hears from you, but <br/>\nthe things the world hands him on his plate--too big, too small, too <br/>\nweak, etc. What can&#39;t he reach, what can&#39;t he do, all the times reality <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t match the vision in his head, the weather, the time, etc., all <br/>\nthe things out of his control. That will both help you see the world <br/>\nfrom his perspective and demonstrate the places where you can make <br/>\nempowering changes for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may have a different perspective on this process than what you&#39;re <br/>\ncomfortable with, however, and certainly, I can&#39;t know to what extent <br/>\nyou&#39;re dealing with anger from this one post.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, personally, am very opposed to outside intervention and therapists. <br/>\n*deep sigh* I think they send the message that a child&#39;s emotions are <br/>\nnot only too big for him to deal with, but also too big for mom and <br/>\ndad--that the child *himself* is too much for mom and dad. Sometimes the <br/>\nintense emotions *are* too big for mom and dad, absolutely, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve that added layer of labeling and intervention helps the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve done, instead, is to read as much as I can, to spend as much <br/>\ntime with my child, observing my child, and empowering myself as the <br/>\nexpert. I&#39;ve adapted lots of tools from books to our lives, and we&#39;ve <br/>\nfound them really helpful, but I&#39;ve been able to do this without Sam <br/>\nfeeling as if he&#39;s a &quot;problem.&quot; And, I think that&#39;s really crucial.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, this is long, and I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s been helpful or <br/>\nnot.

We eliminated dairy beginning in December.  Things seem better, but not better enough -- and it&#39;s hard to tell if it&#39;s the diet or other changes we&#39;ve made.  In any case it&#39;s not the drastic change I&#39;ve heard others talk about.   I&#39;ve been stocking up on gluten-free items, and need to figure out a gluten-free menu, and we&#39;ll try that elimination too after Valentine&#39;s I think.  If those don&#39;t do it, we&#39;ll probably try Feingold.  I&#39;d like to get him allergy tested, but at the moment that would involve serious coercion.  (The last time he had vaccinations required 5 nurses -- never again.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have become convinced that there&#39;s an organic basis of some sort to his anger and aggression.

The first would be to talk with the grands and ask them not <br/>\nto send anything at all to the kids without clearing it with the <br/>\nparents first, or to send it to dad&#39;s workplace. That gives you a <br/>\nwider range of options in terms of communicating with the kids <br/>\nbefore-hand and looking for solutions proactively. That&#39;s something <br/>\nyou can generalize to other situations, too, not just gifts: giving <br/>\neveryone in the family some advance notice of changes and talking <br/>\nabout the potential &quot;fallout&quot; from those changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thought I have is more general - what do each of the kids <br/>\nhave to say? Not just about this particular instance, but are the 4 <br/>\nand 10 yr olds interested in trying to help things go more smoothly <br/>\nwith their bro? I don&#39;t know your family situation, but my stepson <br/>\ncame to live with us from a household that was *much* more top-down <br/>\nthan our family, so I tend to approach these sorts of issues from <br/>\nthe perspective of &quot;enlightened self-interest&quot;. Rather than <br/>\nsaying &quot;how can we help your little sister?&quot; I start from &quot;lets see <br/>\nif we can brainstorm some ideas so she&#39;s not driving you nuts&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find involving Ray in the problem solving helps alot - his ideas <br/>\nare sometimes better than mine, and he appreciates that he&#39;s being <br/>\ntreated as a partner in the process. *That* makes him willing <br/>\nto &quot;put up&quot; with a bit more from a boistrous 5yr old when we can&#39;t <br/>\nfind any solutions in the moment. He at least feels like we&#39;re all <br/>\non the same team. <br/>\n<br/>\nKids are different, and sometimes one kid in a family needs more <br/>\nattention and energy than the others. Working towards an environment <br/>\nwhere &quot;everyone&#39;s needs are valued&quot; can create a more peaceful <br/>\nfamily than focussing on trying to be &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;balanced&quot;. That can <br/>\nbe a hard idea to get used to - most parenting advice tends toward <br/>\ngiving kids &quot;equal time&quot; or energy. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also check out Danielle&#39;s site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://danielleconger.organiclearning.org/index.html\">http://danielleconger.organiclearning.org/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96057767,"authorName":"Katharine Wise","from":"Katharine Wise &lt;katharinewise@...&gt;","profile":"katharinewise","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] problem","postDate":"1170868661","msgId":21256,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU5Njc0OS4zMTM0Mi5xbUB3ZWI2MDMyNS5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":21253,"nextInTopic":21259,"prevInTime":21255,"nextInTime":21257,"topicId":21238,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for your response, Alex.

I&#39;ve come to recognize he needs someone in addition to me to help him learn to manage frustration better and to help me recognize what his personal limitations and challenges are.

I took him to the ped and tried everything I could think of, then <br/>\nrealized one day that I&#39;d been increasing dairy in his diet w/out <br/>\nrealizing it--and I knew he was sensitive when he was younger, but <br/>\nthe symptoms of too much dairy had changed, and before this I didn&#39;t <br/>\nrealize that allergies could affect behavior.  Anyway, after getting <br/>\nall dairy out of his system (this took about 2 months) I noticed a <br/>\nhuge improvement.  Then periodically I would &quot;test&quot; to see if it <br/>\nstill affected him by giving him a little bit and seeing what would <br/>\nhappen.  We were able to figure out how much was &quot;too much&quot;.  <br/>\nEventually, he&#39;s been able to eat dairy again.  I had him allergy <br/>\ntested when he was 9 or 10 and found out that it didn&#39;t show up as an <br/>\nallergy anymore, but I personally think he still has a slight <br/>\nsensitivity and as he gets older is more able to manage it.  Also, <br/>\nthe whole process was a real education about food choices for him at <br/>\na young age, as well as me!<br/>\nJust something to think about...
