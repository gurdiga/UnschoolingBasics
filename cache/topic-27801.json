Those ideas are very helpful.  I do struggle, because<br/>\nthe older one looks forward all week to playgroup day and the little<br/>\none loves her yoga class (but that might be because she doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nto play with anyone - lol).  But focusing more on giving her things<br/>\nthat she can just do on her own, as you suggested, is a great idea.  I<br/>\ndo tell her that it is o.k. to not play with others or share if she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to.  I guess continuing to give her better words to use<br/>\nis the second part.  I just have to work on doing that part with<br/>\npositive not negative energy (because I&#39;m usually thinking negative<br/>\nthoughts when I tell her).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for some great suggestions!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarla  Mom to Amy (8 yo.) and Lily (4 yo.)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"Genant2@aol.com","from":"Genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Guidance without Guilt","postDate":"1195483467","msgId":27823,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5Yi4yMDgwMDNjNi4zNDcyZmI0YkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27804,"nextInTopic":27831,"prevInTime":27822,"nextInTime":27824,"topicId":27801,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/19/2007 9:19:44 A.M.

If you have any  ideas for how to deal with this, I&#39;d<br/>\nlove to hear  them.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI personally would try helping her find words like you suggested (I don&#39;t  <br/>\nfeel like playing right now) and help her practice those phrases before she goes <br/>\n to the park.   <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest had a period of time back along when he did  not want to go to <br/>\npark day because of a couple of children.  It is hard to  &quot;get away&quot; from those <br/>\nchildren.  You could try inviting families of your  choosing over to your <br/>\nhouse, for a play day or craft day or something.  I  know I have two children and <br/>\nmy oldest always wanted to go to the park, so I  would have other alternatives <br/>\nthat my youngest liked to do, when he did not want  to play.  Like we would <br/>\nbring books and I would read to him in the car or  at the picnic tables.  I <br/>\nwould bring DVDs and would sit in the car  with him to watch them, etc.  A couple <br/>\nof times I would bring Art Trading  Card stuff, everyone would get involved <br/>\nin making their own so it wasn&#39;t a  &quot;cooperative&quot; thing to do.  So that he <br/>\nwould not feel the pressure to play  and would not have to continually be asked to <br/>\nplay and why he didn&#39;t want to  play etc.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI am sure there are other alternatives so that your one  child can feel more <br/>\nsecure, and not have to use harsh words to get her point  across.  Remember to <br/>\nvalidate her and let her know that it is fine to not  want to play, she does <br/>\nnot have to play if she does not want to.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI know my youngest would resort to names like &quot;stupid&quot; if the other child  <br/>\nwere persisting.  KWIM.  Like his frustration level was building, so  having <br/>\nthings at the park that your daughter can do alone, or that comfort  her, might <br/>\nhelp with that frustration level.   Have a way that  she can let you know that <br/>\nshe is getting frustrated and needs help maybe.<br/>\n <br/>\nPam  G<br/>\n<br/>\nOur Blogs:<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/_\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/)\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/_\">http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/)\">http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77228268,"authorName":"Marla B.","from":"&quot;Marla B.&quot; &lt;marla@...&gt;","profile":"hilltowner4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Guidance without Guilt","postDate":"1195411561","msgId":27804,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZocTE5OStrMTY5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNjOS4yMTRlZDBmNC4zNDcxYWEyMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27801,"nextInTopic":27823,"prevInTime":27803,"nextInTime":27805,"topicId":27801,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"- ...
