Some kids just need a gentle <br/>\nreminder that other people don&#39;t want to get covered in sand.

Is she frustrated or exploring or exicited or just love the <br/>\nway the sand glitters in the air?<br/>\n<br/>\nMorgan (5) loves to throw things, so I look for ways to expand her <br/>\nthrowing options in general.

At <br/>\nthat age I would work to redirect her energy in a different way, <br/>\neither by getting closer to her and offering to play a point-blank <br/>\ngame of catch, if she wanted to throw something solid, or suggest -<br/>\nvia modelling- pouring or sprinkling the substance if it was <br/>\nsomething more like sand or gravel.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Any hints on how to look up posts?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you are looking for your own posts and replies you can type your <br/>\nemail address or screen name into the search bar.
