But I&#39;m<br/>\nclueless on  meditating, any suggestion on where to start?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********<br/>\n <br/>\nThere are others on this list that are more knowledgeable about such  <br/>\nsubjects, but I enjoy Eckhart Tolle.  He does not teach meditation, but  about <br/>\naccepting the present moment.  He has a couple of books and CD  series.<br/>\n <br/>\nRight this second, things are as they are.  You can&#39;t change that, but  you <br/>\ncan begin to let your mind quit trying to make it different than it is and  you <br/>\ncan begin to stop focusing on what is going to happen next.  When you  start <br/>\nto notice what your mind&#39;s thoughts are at any given moment, it is usually  in <br/>\nthe past or future, rarely right now.  &quot;This should have been taken care  of <br/>\nalready&quot; or &quot;I need to get the laundry started.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nSo my &quot;right now&quot; practice can be to just stop what I&#39;m doing and watch my  <br/>\nchildren.  Really watch them.  It is pretty neat.  I often find  my mind <br/>\nslipping in and out, other thoughts creep in.  That&#39;s OK.  I  accept that is as it <br/>\nis, too.  It is incredibly peaceful and creates a  stronger connection with <br/>\nyour children, I think.  Even just a few moments a  day or week of this makes a <br/>\ndifference.<br/>\n <br/>\nHere is a quote from Eckhart&#39;s new book, A New Earth.  &quot;How do  you bring <br/>\nBeing into the life of a busy family, into the relationship with your  child?  <br/>\nThe key is to give your child attention.  There are two kinds  of attention.  <br/>\nOne we might call form-based attention.  The other is  formless attention.  <br/>\nForm-based attention is always connected in some way  with doing or evaluating.  <br/>\n&#39;Have you done your homework? Eat your dinner.  Tidy up your room.  Brush your <br/>\nteeth.  Do this.  Stop doing  that.  Hurry up, get ready.&#39;  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat&#39;s the next thing we have to do?  this question pretty much  summarizes <br/>\nwhat family life is like in many homes.  Form-based attention is  of course <br/>\nnecessary and has its place, but if that&#39;s all there is in the  relationship with <br/>\nyour child, then the most vital dimension is missing and Being  becomes <br/>\ncompletely obscured by doing, by &#39;the cares of the world,&#39; as Jesus puts  it.  <br/>\nFormless attention is inseparable from the dimension of Being.   How does it work?<br/>\n <br/>\nAs you look at, listen to, touch, or help your child with this or that, you  <br/>\nare alert, still, completely present, not wanting anything other than that  <br/>\nmoment as it is.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8845,"nextTopicId":8797}}
