I also have <br/>\na rocky relationship with my mother. I&#39;m even going to read a book <br/>\ncalled Divorcing A Parent. I had it recommended to me by a friend. I <br/>\nagree when it starts to affect the kids that is when something has to <br/>\nchange. For me it seemed just the worry and stress about having to see <br/>\nmy mom contributed to me being less patient with my own children. I <br/>\nknow i need to own my feelings and not put the blame on my mother but <br/>\nshe just seems to have such a profound effect on me that it trickles <br/>\ndown and affects my own mothering. At this point i&#39;m not sure where to <br/>\ngo with our relationship. Therapy maybe? One of my biggest fears is <br/>\nthat my children will feel about me someday the way i now feel about my <br/>\nmom. I know i&#39;m a much different mother but she is still a huge part of <br/>\nme since she raised me my whole life. I want to find forgiveness in my <br/>\nheart for her but i can&#39;t seem to get past my anger to do that right <br/>\nnow. Anyway enough ranting. It is nice though to know i&#39;m not alone <br/>\nhere with the troubled mother relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nKendrah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19930,"nextTopicId":20064}}
