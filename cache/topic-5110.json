A lot of times when they say<br/>\nthey&#39;re full what they really mean is that they&#39;re<br/>\ndone eating as much of the whatever was served as they<br/>\nwanted. I have now started asking if they want<br/>\nsomething else instead. Sometimes I get a yes and<br/>\nother times it&#39;s a no followed by a request for snack<br/>\na few minutes later. <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of traffic on this list today and I&#39;m way<br/>\nbehind. So I&#39;m sure everything that I&#39;m going to say<br/>\nhas been said already. I&#39;m new here. I&#39;m unschoolish<br/>\n(Thanks Pam for that word) and not a veteran at this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too believed in family dinner times. Some of my<br/>\nfondest memories are of dinner times. We would sit<br/>\naround the table talking long after everyone was done<br/>\neating. So I tried to do the same. But it didn&#39;t work<br/>\nand too much energy was being wasted in getting them<br/>\nto eat &quot;properly&quot;, so that we didn&#39;t have much<br/>\nconversation anyway. Looking back at my childhood I<br/>\nrealized that the family dinner routine was<br/>\nestablished when we were all older - above 8 for sure<br/>\nand did not need help with eating. Also that was the<br/>\n_only_ time that we connected with our parents. So<br/>\nI&#39;ve dropped the family dinner for now. We feed the<br/>\nkids first if they&#39;re hungry or they eat whenever<br/>\nthey&#39;re hungry. The connecting still matters to me. I<br/>\nwork full-time and am not with them all day. But that<br/>\ndoes not have to happen over dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea I had was that food had to be eaten at<br/>\nthe table and not elsewhere. Mostly because of not<br/>\nwanting to clean up a mess everywhere. My kids would<br/>\nmuch rather be playing than eating and would not eat<br/>\nenough and then get up in the middle of the night<br/>\nasking for milk. I&#39;ve decided that my sleep is more<br/>\nimportant that rules about when and where to eat :-).<br/>\nSo I&#39;ve loosened my rule about eating at the table. I<br/>\ndecide based on the food item instead of it being a<br/>\nblanket rule. I also feed the younger one while he&#39;s<br/>\nchugging his trains or watching a movie. He eats more<br/>\nwillingly that way and I get a good night&#39;s rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso it helps me to acknowledge my own needs. So I let<br/>\nthem know when I&#39;m hungry or sleepy and hence likely<br/>\nto be impatient. Sometimes they nap and then are up<br/>\njumping on the bed at 10.30 pm. I tell them that I<br/>\nneed to go to bed, but I&#39;m willing to read to them<br/>\nright now and they don&#39;t have to go to bed<br/>\nimmediately, but won&#39;t get another book when they&#39;re<br/>\nready to go to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nManisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nYahoo!
