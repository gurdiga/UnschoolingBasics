First,,have you tried <br/>\n </span></blockquote>looking into the dietary issues that are known to cause autism in <br/>\nchildren..like the wheat and milk products. I have read articles <br/>\nthat for children with Autism..they have even CURED It by removing <br/>\nthem. I know this is not the same disorder..but you could look up <br/>\nautism on the curezone.com website. There is an excellent article <br/>\nabout a boy&#39;s parents who would not give up and cured their son <br/>\neventually. The mom also published a book. It seems in these <br/>\nchildren the milk and wheat actually pass through the blood-brain <br/>\nbarrier and act like a hallucenagenic drug not much different than <br/>\nLSD!!! In fact when some European DRs studied brains of these <br/>\nchildren..they actually found LSD compounds..knowing that the parent <br/>\nwere not giving the kids LSD ..they researched futher and found a <br/>\ndigestive disorder in the intestines..that allows for this....VERY <br/>\nINTERESTING STUFF!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second suggestion is to look into EFT (emotional freedom <br/>\ntechnique) I am currently studying it and it is AMAZING. It can do <br/>\nso much , so quick, and for sooo many different things...I can not <br/>\neven attempt to explain here. I will only say I was intrigued <br/>\nbecause I found Gary Craig&#39;s website where you can download the 82 <br/>\npage handbook on how to do it...completely FREE!!! WWW.emofree.com<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also contact an eft specialist and do it over the phone..but <br/>\nI would recommend finding someone in you local area and meet with <br/>\nthem at first. It is similiar to emotional acupuncture..but you tap <br/>\non meridians on your body while you verbalize...and that is it. I <br/>\nhave read about severely handicaped children with terrible <br/>\nbehavorial disorders..really improve with this!
