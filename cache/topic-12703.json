So she would only see dad about three <br/>\nhours.  So she always went to bed late with us and we slept in until <br/>\nwe felt like getting up.  I knew when she was born I was <br/>\nhomeschooling.  Sometimes her and I would be in bed still when my <br/>\nhubby came home for lunch at 12:00pm.  It was so cool.  We were <br/>\nnever outside playing until after 1:00pm.  Then when she was a few <br/>\nyears old and until now she would always sleep 12 hours so her norm <br/>\non waking up was about 10:30am.  Now she is 6 and these past two <br/>\nmonths her body changed her clock and started getting up 8:00 and <br/>\n9:00am.  My youngest daughter she has been my early bird and does <br/>\nnot require as much sleep as my oldest.  But she has gone back and <br/>\nforth on sleeping in because of myself and Jenna.  Its been amazing <br/>\nwatching them grow and see what happens naturally.  I think maybe <br/>\nthe &quot;bedtime&quot; was invented for all the kids that needed to go to <br/>\nschool?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing I loved having some time with my girls before bed and <br/>\nin the evening for the &quot;down&quot; time its my favorite part of our day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nsmiles~Angela</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12680,"nextTopicId":12682}}
