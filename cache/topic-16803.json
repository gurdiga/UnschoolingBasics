I am one year into unschooling but I believe that those who have more experience and comfort with this lifestyle would say that there are day when all is not as they would want it.  I think that the difference is how we look at it.  The situation with your dd could have unfolded the exact same in a different unschoolers home and they would not have thought twice about it because there is less to little judgment for the child&#39;s feelings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I am writing, it is really clicking for me why they say put yourself in the child&#39;s mind.  If you were some where and there was a big ugly bug and someone told you to just move past it but you were truly afraid, it would be helpful if someone came to get rid of the bug, kill it or whatever.  I believe that your dd was truly fearful.  THere is no judgment in that.  If your bf did not want to kill it and you had no problem with that, then that may have changed the situation totally.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling does not lead to a life where everyone is happy and blissful all the time.  I do think that there is more bliss and happiness in unshcooling than not.  But, unschooling is life.  Unschooling is conscientious living.  Unschooling calls for us to be very mindful as we live our lives and interact with our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that when parents who want to unschool release fear, then they too will find the joy and happiness that they hear other talk about.  But it won&#39;t because there children are doing exactly what they want to do.  THe joy and bliss that they feel will be internal and extend out to their children and really put us in a place where we love our children unconditionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you all the best.

I rather feel a bit discouraged and I dunno if I  <br/>\ncan go this way now. Exactly these things are the ones I am wondering  <br/>\nabout. We are not officially unschooling yet, I have just started  <br/>\nsaying &quot;yes&quot; way a lot more often. But we are also confused how to  <br/>\nhandle many minor issues. For instance, yesterday she wanted to go  <br/>\ndownstairs, but there was some little bug. It was a male mosquito,  <br/>\nthose that are bigger than the females but which do not sting. She  <br/>\n(7) knows that they don&#39;t but she panics. She wanted me to go  <br/>\ndownstairs with her. I didn&#39;t want to. My bf came and said he would  <br/>\nstand in front of it so she could pass &quot;safely&quot;. She wanted him to  <br/>\nkill it instead and brought a thingy (I dunno in English, these.. fly  <br/>\ncatchers or whatever). He said that the bug was harmless and didn&#39;t  <br/>\neven sting and he wasn&#39;t going to kill it, because he never kills  <br/>\nthese (he&#39;s vegetarian :-D). And then she started crying. Then I  <br/>\nstarted thinking that choosing between braking HER heart or killing a  <br/>\nstupid mosquito, maybe we should rather kill the stupid mosquito. But  <br/>\nthen, my old Johanna started thinking &quot;now she is learning that qhen  <br/>\nshe cries, she gets all&quot;... I said to my bf &quot;well I dunno&quot;... he  <br/>\nkilled it. And then she passed. And he said also he didn&#39;t know how  <br/>\nthese things would be handled.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read about unschooling I was rather encouraged, everything  <br/>\nseems to be so &quot;joyful&quot; and so on.

I do my best to be respectful of others, even those who I disagree with.  The main reason that I am that way is because I have had to work for a good while to stand in my power and not waiver because someone does not approve.  The last thing I want is for someone to persuade me that my peaceful parenting, unschooling approach to relating to my kids is wrong.  So, I have extended that same respect and courtesy to my hubby.  Like most hubby&#39;s on this list, my husband is a good person who is doing what he thinks is best for his children.  I have come to the place that he is going to have to figure out what works best for himself.  What I try to do is be true to how I deal with the children.  Do I cringe at some of the things that he says?  Sure I do.  Do I dislike some of his interactiong with our children?  Yes!  But I have learned that trying to &quot;correct&quot; him or convince him of how wrong or inappropriate I think his behavior is is futile and actually leads to more dissention than household harmony.  He is gone most of the time so most of the time my children are unschooled.  When he is home, I still am the main person that my children come to.  Because of my approach to interacting with my children, things tend to be kind of laid back anyway and he goes with the flow.  So when he does say something like, &quot;No, you just had chocolate.&quot;  EVen though the kids are seeing that he is having BOTH chocolate AND ice cream, I just let it be.  When he is gone they will get chocolate and ice cream if they ask me.  Nothing against Daddy I will simply say yes because that is what they requested.  Plus, my hubby is the type that is affected by our children&#39;s sensitivity.  He tends to be a fair and just person so if one of my children called him out on why he is getting both, he has come to a place where he will evaluate the situation and either nix what they did not have, give them what they requested or something that shows that he is listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I am rambling a bit now.  I don&#39;t know if it is just the messages that I am checking but there seems to be a theme running of mother is cool with unschooling and Daddy isn&#39;t.  For most of us we will not agree all of the time on how to relate to our children.  There is balance in it all, at least that is how I see it.  Because I KNOW that I do things that are completely and totally inappropriate with my children.  I don&#39;t need my hubby hovering over me to point out my mistakes.  What I feel most comfortable doing is checking my ownself.  And somehow, I don&#39;t know how, but by just focusing on making sure that I am relating to my children in a way that is respectful, loving, peaceful, kind, my hubby is doing the same thing.  Will he ever call himself an unschooler?  I doubt it.  But he sure is living the unschooling life.  Bless his heart, he has come into this kicking and screaming but it is all working out despite.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest to you and I hope that you pat you and your hubby on the back for striving to do the best you can to nurture your beautiful children.<br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\nTyra<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Cara&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:casonnier@...\">casonnier@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: 2006/08/26 Sat PM 07:44:36 CDT<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Will it ever be enough?!?!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also like to know this too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe food thing seems to be a dividing point for me and my hubby too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight - the girls wanted a brownie, so they had one.

I don&#39;t have to force my children to be<br/>\nrespectful!&quot;  Forced respect is not true respect.  It&#39;s like making a<br/>\nclass full of kids (or a stadium full or people) stand for the pledge<br/>\nof allegiance or national anthem.  Do all those people truly feel<br/>\nrespect for the flag or words of the song?  I doubt it.  But they do<br/>\nit because they have been taught the actions of respect without the<br/>\nmeaning of respect.  How often did you witness as a child other kids<br/>\nfidgeting, moving around, whispering with a neighbor when they should<br/>\nhave been saying, &quot;I pledge allegiance to the flag......&quot;?  That guy<br/>\nat the baseball game who is standing with his hand reluctantly over<br/>\nhis heart or the woman who continues looking at the pictures of the<br/>\nballplayers in the program rather than singing the national anthem?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Just let it go, and discuss later how your<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; opinion differs from his and see how the conversation goes.It is<br/>\n&gt; much easier to let it go-considering the issue is small-and if it<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t there is probably time to have a private discussion and change<br/>\n&gt; their mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Changing your mind later doesn&#39;t fix the problem now.  Even &quot;little<br/>\nproblems&quot; can be a stumbling block in building trust.  I think it is<br/>\nmuch better for parents to agree to work out differences NOW than<br/>\nlater.  And what is so wrong with children seeing parents work through<br/>\nthe process of figuring it all out rather than some clandestine jury<br/>\nthat suddenly comes out with a surprise answer?

Exactly these things are the ones I am wondering  <br/>\nabout. We are not officially unschooling yet, I have just started  <br/>\nsaying &quot;yes&quot; way a lot more often. But we are also confused how to  <br/>\nhandle many minor issues. For instance, yesterday she wanted to go  <br/>\ndownstairs, but there was some little bug. It was a male mosquito,  <br/>\nthose that are bigger than the females but which do not sting. She  <br/>\n(7) knows that they don&#39;t but she panics. She wanted me to go  <br/>\ndownstairs with her. I didn&#39;t want to. My bf came and said he would  <br/>\nstand in front of it so she could pass &quot;safely&quot;. She wanted him to  <br/>\nkill it instead and brought a thingy (I dunno in English, these.. fly  <br/>\ncatchers or whatever). He said that the bug was harmless and didn&#39;t  <br/>\neven sting and he wasn&#39;t going to kill it, because he never kills  <br/>\nthese (he&#39;s vegetarian :-D). And then she started crying. Then I  <br/>\nstarted thinking that choosing between braking HER heart or killing a  <br/>\nstupid mosquito, maybe we should rather kill the stupid mosquito. But  <br/>\nthen, my old Johanna started thinking &quot;now she is learning that qhen  <br/>\nshe cries, she gets all&quot;... I said to my bf &quot;well I dunno&quot;... he  <br/>\nkilled it. And then she passed. And he said also he didn&#39;t know how  <br/>\nthese things would be handled.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read about unschooling I was rather encouraged, everything  <br/>\nseems to be so &quot;joyful&quot; and so on.

So, the bill is climbing up there and my parents will <br/>\npick up the<br/>\n  tab (for the dinner AND the entire vacation rental—we’re there for a <br/>\nweek). The<br/>\n issue of dessert comes up. All the adults are stuffed (STUFFED!)<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Why would all this matter?

I would have asked him to stop, breathe, <br/>\nand ask *himself* why he said no.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;d also try to figure why she&#39;s whining---or is that just how you&#39;re <br/>\ncoloring the picture for us? Was she really whining? Why? Tired?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t like vanilla either---unless it&#39;s covering or covered with <br/>\nsomething *much* yummier. Would you have had the same reaction if I <br/>\nwere tagging along? Why/why not?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I’m the idiot (that’s how I feel right now in my bad attitude) who <br/>\nconsiders it<br/>\n  and the wishy-washy mom v. dad stuff starts (in front of my family <br/>\nwhich just<br/>\n  adds to things). So, DH says no and I’m quietly saying to him, why <br/>\nnot, I’ll<br/>\n  pay for it out of my money (DH has money issues and many things seem <br/>\nlike<br/>\n  splurges, which they probably are as we live hand to mouth on his <br/>\nteacher’s<br/>\n  salary, but I earn a bit of mad money with a very part time job). But, <br/>\nnow the<br/>\n  issue is more than money for him…he doesn’t understand why the ice <br/>\ncream at the<br/>\n cottage can’t be good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Because.<br/>\n<br/>\n That&#39;s the answer for some things.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I’m indulging some of the worried feelings of “am<br/>\n  I spoiling her by giving in” and feeling like crap. She’s whining and <br/>\ngetting<br/>\n  what feels to me like rude to my parents who just got us this <br/>\nincredible meal…I<br/>\n  want her to just be thankful for what she’s just had and not be <br/>\nfocused and<br/>\n crying over what she might not get.

It could have been about not enough time with you or not being <br/>\nSTUFFED or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Could be that she was overwhelmed with too much attention on her---or <br/>\nshe felt dismissed because there was no attention on her.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-===-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n So, we are in the ice cream shop<br/>\n  and now of course DD-4yrs also wants some – totally expected that…we <br/>\norder her’s<br/>\n  in a cup so she can eat it in the truck on the way back so we can get <br/>\nto<br/>\n  RockStar on time. Now it’s DD-8yrs turn and she wants a cone – if she <br/>\nhas a<br/>\n  cone DD-4yrs will want a cone and then we’ll end up with ice cream all <br/>\nover the<br/>\n  truck and them on the ride home, so we tell DD-8yrs we’d rather her <br/>\nget a<br/>\n cup…she’s annoyed and pouting now…<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Now who&#39;s whining???<br/>\n<br/>\n  Was all of this unexpected?

I made a decision long before I was an unschooler that I would not control my hubby&#39;s approach to parenting his children.  He has the same position.  So if my husband had said, no, then whatever the after math of that would be based on his actions.  Maybe I would try to help my child gain an understanding or find a way to not focus on what she is not getting and instead focus on all the other things that went well that day.  I do that often with my older son.  But I feel we do more harm than good by trying to convince someone who is just not there yet that unschooling is the way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow long does it take for those of us who say we are committed to radical unschooling to actually buy into it?  For some a while.  I did not even consider unschooling as a viable way of life for me until I needed.  No one could have convinced me, I was closed to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy position is that ours is a family unit.  I don&#39;t see how we can always get along all the time.  I don&#39;t expect my children to be happy all the time and when they are not I offer my assistance to help them find perspective if they are open to receiving it.  But as long as I am committed to unschooling, radical unschooling, this is what my children will receive from me.  I may not always agree with my husband&#39;s approach and his words but I don&#39;t need him to buy into unschooling for it to work for us.  I spend the majority of my day with my kids so the majority of their day is spent in unschooling.  The other thing I think about is that for every thing I dislike about my husband&#39;s approach to relating to our children, he has the same amount for me.  I would greatly dislike it if my hubby tried to change my peaceful parenting approach so I don&#39;t try to change him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if you try to work on your perspective, see the positive.  Acknowledge undesired situations for what they are but continue your commitment and positive outlook, you will eventually begin to see the fruits of your positive thoughts and positive energy.  The more firmly I stand in my belief and trust in this unschooling lifestyle, the more I am able to see the fruits of my position.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you much success.  I pray that you will soon stand in a better place because this really works despite what the outward appearance looks like.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch love and Peace<br/>\nTyra<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Aimee & Paul Bogush&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shaggyhill@...\">shaggyhill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: 2006/08/26 Sat PM 07:22:18 CDT<br/>\nTo: &quot;unschoolingbasics&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Will it ever be enough?!?!<br/>\n<br/>\nAl right, I&#39;m putting this out there....<br/>\n <br/>\nHelpplease, a fresh pair of eyes and an objective view are needed:</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8100313,"authorName":"Monica","from":"&quot;Monica&quot; &lt;GregMonica@...&gt;","profile":"gregmonica","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Will it ever be enough?!?!","postDate":"1156645001","msgId":16814,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVjcXZhOStlMnZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA4MjYxODAxZzI5OWVhYmMyaGYyNjRkYzdkMmU3MzUzYjdAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":16813,"nextInTopic":16816,"prevInTime":16813,"nextInTime":16815,"topicId":16803,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Though I am very new to unschooling and am not a radical unschooler, I firmly believe that unschooling does not mean un-parenting.

I <br/>\nbelieve that it&#39;s our responsibility as parents to help them <br/>\nunderstand that no one ever gets everything they want and occasional <br/>\ndisappointments are a natural part of life.  Could you perhaps give <br/>\nthe older child a certain amount of &quot;mad money&quot; each week to use as <br/>\nshe chooses?  We often do this with my daughter and she makes her own <br/>\nchoices about what to buy or save.  It gives her freedom but shows <br/>\nher responsibility as well.  Giving them everything they want is a <br/>\nfalse representation of the adult world and will create problems when <br/>\nthey grow up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also believe that you and your husband should come to some sort of <br/>\nagreement.  Has he read plenty of unschooling literature?  Have you <br/>\nboth explained your positions to each other?  If you have, and you&#39;re <br/>\nstill in disagreement, I believe a compromise is in order.  Your <br/>\nrelationship is very important, IMHO more important than doing <br/>\nabsolutely everything the radical unschooling way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to reiterate that I do not completely understand radical <br/>\nunschooling and some of my advice might not fly with those who <br/>\nembrace it.  I simply believe that children should be shown how to <br/>\nhandle not always getting their way, because I can&#39;t think of a <br/>\nsingle adult who can claim that they always do.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with your journey!

I&#39;m sorry!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I, too, battle with the &quot;When is it enough!?  When will you be happy, already?!&quot;. But, during this journey, these are a couple of things I&#39;ve learned.  Unschooling is not un-parenting.  Their behaviour is basically normal child behaviour (4 and 8, right?).  All they know right now is the here and now.  And. . . . .it is OK to say no.  Yes.  They may not like it.  But, it is ok.  Yes.  You may have to endure some whining.  But, you know, I get whining no matter what I do, so. . . . .<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Maybe get them involved.  Pick 2 or 3 or 4 things (you can afford and you know they like) and say, &quot;Which one?&quot;.  Have sort of a family meeting and keep them involved in what&#39;s going on.  Lay the $$ out on the table.  Tell them (as you move the $$ away) and show them that this is all there is - - - let them pick.  Mix and match, maybe.  Trade with someone, maybe.  Right now, my kids want to do something with horses (2 boys and 1 girl, 10, 8 and 4 yo, and they ALL just LOVE &quot;Saddle Club&quot;!  Go figure!), and I *know* I cannot afford it.  So. . .I&#39;m looking for someone to trade with. . .someone that will let them muck out stables or otherwise work their way to riding and dealing with horses.  But, in the meantime, we&#39;re still doing some of the other things they want to (bowling, skating, swimming, etc.)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  As far as dh. . . .well, he really doesn&#39;t have much of a clue that we&#39;re unschooling.  He works very hard.  . .. and as long as I use the correct verbage, he&#39;s ok with it.  But, I will say that if he makes a decision that I&#39;m not comfortable with, I will ask myself, &quot;What&#39;s the big deal if he makes that decision and I agree?&quot;  If it&#39;s a big deal, I will try and appeal to him (hopefully showing the kids the right way to do this), but, otherwise (as with the ice cream), I would agree with him.

I <br/>\nam a step behind you, in that I am starting to think about releasing <br/>\nsome control as a parent that I&#39;ve held onto. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing I see, that maybe you already know, is that if you <br/>\ndon&#39;t start radical unschooling from the second they are born-it may <br/>\nnot work. <br/>\nThey have learned some things about how to get what they want, and <br/>\nhow they don&#39;t really have to have responsiblity for anything or <br/>\nanyone-because Mom and Dad have always been there making them <br/>\napologize or not be rude or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also say that if Dad says no-then no. That makes it easier-<br/>\nkids will know the differences between Mom and Dad and there will <br/>\nalways be differences. When he&#39;s at work and when he&#39;s not-you can <br/>\nbe a radical unschooler. But when he says no-just let it go-and tell <br/>\nthem that Dad said no. They&#39;ll learn to ask you instead of him :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I don&#39;t know how radical unschoolers handle this-but you as a <br/>\nperson have boundaries- you shouldn&#39;t feel pushed around by your <br/>\nkids, it&#39;s your money, your time, your feelings. They need to learn <br/>\nto respect you. They need to know that you choose whether to spend <br/>\nyour money on them or not. They need to know that you are tired or <br/>\nsick or ???  I know that as a radical unschooler you will do <br/>\nanything you can to help your children have freedom and explore the <br/>\nworld, but you have to be real about it. One thing they will learn <br/>\nis to respect others-why not you too? It&#39;s hard to live with other <br/>\npeople-especially when they are bad roommates. :)<br/>\nThis is one thing that I struggle with-how do I get them to respect <br/>\nme and their siblings without forcing them to?

We’ve been","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-386096174\">Al right, I&#39;m putting this out there....<br/>\n <br/>\nHelp�please, a fresh pair of eyes and an objective view are needed:<br/>\n <br/>\nThis summer has been excruciating!  We�ve been unschooling all along in the �education� realm and began moving (somewhat rapidly) into applying it to all of our lives since the spring (when was that conference in Peabody?).  In some ways it has been a real blessing, but in others &lt;tears&gt; it has caused much misery.  Argh!  Here is an example of a day to day sort of occurrence where it doesn�t seem to be �working�, causing a disconnect in the family that has been extremely difficult to endure.  DH and I are further apart on this than we ever have been in any other area of our lives together and it�s really wearing on us &lt;tears&gt;.  OK, so here�s an example of what�s been happening around here for you to help diagnose the problem and suggest a solution � because right now I feel totally trapped�I can�t go back to a parental-control model, but this is ripping us apart � I feel like fleeing my family, it�s just too hard!<br/>\n <br/>\nWe are on vacation.  At a funky, cool, nice restaurant with my brother (Uncle) and my parents (grandparents).  We are having a blast, the food is phenomenal, the kids are able to get yummy things (calamari, clam chowder, potato latkes, two Shirley Temples) and are able to talk, move about, etc�not a stuffy joint, stuffy crowd.  So, the bill is climbing up there and my parents will pick up the tab (for the dinner AND the entire vacation rental�we�re there for a week).  The issue of dessert comes up.  All the adults are stuffed (STUFFED!) and DH, the girls and I are going to go back to the cottage to watch RockStar Supernova (which we watch weekly together)�time is running short, we have sundae makings back at the cottage so we (the adults) decide to forgo dessert.  DD-8yrs starts whining that all we have at the cottage is vanilla and she doesn�t want vanilla so can we go to the ice cream store on the way home.  DH knee-jerks with a no.  I�m the idiot (that�s how I feel right now in my bad attitude) who considers it and the wishy-washy mom v. dad stuff starts (in front of my family which just adds to things).  So, DH says no and I�m quietly saying to him, why not, I�ll pay for it out of my money (DH has money issues and many things seem like splurges, which they probably are as we live hand to mouth on his teacher�s salary, but I earn a bit of mad money with a very part time job).  But, now the issue is more than money for him�he doesn�t understand why the ice cream at the cottage can�t be good enough.  I�m indulging some of the worried feelings of �am I spoiling her by giving in� and feeling like crap.  She�s whining and getting what feels to me like rude to my parents who just got us this incredible meal�I want her to just be thankful for what she�s just had and not be focused and crying over what she might not get.  ARGH!  So, we manage to get out of the restaurant, but I�ve decided that I will take them to get the ice cream.  So, we go.  I think DH ended up paying � he and I don�t get any, remember we�re stuffed and there�s some back at the cottage anyway.  So, we are in the ice cream shop and now of course DD-4yrs also wants some � totally expected that�we order her�s in a cup so she can eat it in the truck on the way back so we can get to RockStar on time.  Now it�s DD-8yrs turn and she wants a cone � if she has a cone DD-4yrs will want a cone and then we�ll end up with ice cream all over the truck and them on the ride home, so we tell DD-8yrs we�d rather her get a cup�she�s annoyed and pouting now�and then she starts asking for all sorts of toppings, to which we final break and just say NO.  I get so annoyed I left the store with DD-4yrs so I don�t  take it out on DD-8yrs.  When she does come out, somewhat dejected that �all she got� was a scoop in a cup I did try to explain to her where I was coming from by saying that it just never seems like �enough is enough� for her and that if she focuses on the one or two things that she doesn�t get or don�t go her way instead of looking at ALL the other stuff that she got or had or did, then she�ll end up being a very unhappy person.  I pleaded with her to look at what she has instead of what she doesn�t.  These sorts of exchanges are really taking a toll on DH and I � the kids don�t seem affected, but I might just not see it.<br/>\n <br/>\nI also then spend a lot of energy examining these occurrences afterward � I know they are young and they want and want (and I don&#39;t want her to feel like a bad person if she wants stuff, argh!!!!), but I just don�t always have what it takes (energy, finances, time, etc) to give them all they want and want and want all the time!�.do we ever get to a place of enough?!?!?!<br/>\n <br/>\nI had hoped we would have had this mostly ironed out over the summer before DH goes back to his teaching job, but it hasn�t happened�so here I stand on the doorstep of another year and in some regards I�m afraid of my kids!!!  I�m exhausted from giving them everything even when we couldn�t afford it or I didn�t have the time or energy.  I�m exhausted from them wanting more and from them not seeming to notice what is being done for them or given to them (I know...this is MY problem, but argh!).  I�m exhausted from my 4yr olds tantrums (she�s having one right now with DH in the bedroom because he�s trying to get the girls to �settle in� a bit for the evening � we no longer do �bedtime�).  I�m exhausted from my 8yr old focusing on the negative.  I&#39;m exhausted from fighting with DH over control vs. unschooling.  What the #$%^?!  Where&#39;s the light-hearted fun??<br/>\n <br/>\nThis got long�I�d really like to present some of the other occurrences for a sort of �diagnosis- radical unschooling� response�.maybe in the near future.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo, with your clear eyes help please�<br/>\n <br/>\nOff to try to referee whatever is going on between DH and DD-4yrs�adding further problems to my relationship with him and putting a Band-Aid on the situation rather than finding an answer�<br/>\n <br/>\nI�m tired.  I&#39;m probably too focused on the negative myself.  There have been many, many wonderful exchanges, but these in between those are really trying and upsetting.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAimee<br/>\nIn Connecticut<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCommit random acts of literacy!
