You are so right about the constantly <br/>\nchangeing boundaries and a babies need and supply of boundaries.  I <br/>\nthink the play theropist must be coming from some school of thought <br/>\nregarding child development.  A behaviorist&#39;s point of view, maybe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI loved the way &quot;the unprocessed child&quot; twisted my brain the way <br/>\nhigher math used to do.  I think she&#39;d appreciate that ride, too.  I <br/>\nmay pick her up a copy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought about your baby example a lot and I am thinking about <br/>\ncommon practice in the USA compared to common practive on Earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are more family beds than cribs on Earth.  If, you consider all <br/>\ncountries in her unorganized baby question then, you may see American <br/>\nbabies&#39; brains are organized inferiorly.  Earth-wise, some kids <br/>\nbrains get more stimulation and organization by having no boundaries <br/>\non feeding, warmth, touch, sound, etc. as when a parent practices <br/>\nattachment parenting (which is more common in other countries than in <br/>\nthe USA).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe more boundaries (having to cry it out at night, fed on a <br/>\nschedule, stay in a crib all day and alone at night in a crib with no <br/>\nwarm body or breath or sound coming from that person who previously <br/>\ncarried you around 24/7 for 9 months) the more disorder and stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I barely remember a study comparing brain development (brain <br/>\nOrder?) in South American children (under 2 years) and USA children <br/>\n(under 2).  The South American children&#39;s brains were more developed <br/>\n(ordered) and had more synaps connections than the USA kids.  They <br/>\ndetermined it was because the children were carried and slept with <br/>\nand therefore given more stimulation than the USA kids that were left <br/>\nalone in a crib all day and night.  However after 2 years of age <br/>\nbecause of poverty, malnutritian (once weaned), and no healthcare the <br/>\nCrib babies win in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, unschooling was a continuation to attachment parenting.  And <br/>\nwe strongly believe that our son would be far worse (autistically <br/>\nspeaking) if we had bought a crib.  I hope what is true for a baby <br/>\n(unbounded learning) is true for a school age child and <br/>\nhighschooler.  We&#39;ll find out in about 20 years I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your answer!<br/>\nLex<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sylvia Toyama <br/>\n&lt;sylgt04@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;If we assume that all children come into this world<br/>\n&gt; with an unorganized brain, that only organizes itself<br/>\n&gt; with bumpming into boundaries, how does this<br/>\n&gt; organization take place without boundaries?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *****<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First, I think her assumption is flawed. An infant&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; brain may not work just as the adults would like, but<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s perfectly well put together for the needs of an<br/>\n&gt; infant&#39;s life -- his sense of smell allows him to find<br/>\n&gt; food; he cries when he feels pain, and calms when he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; embraced.  His needs are simple, so the organization<br/>\n&gt; required to meet them is simple. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here are some definitions of organized, copied from<br/>\n&gt; dictionary.com, along with my observations noted.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Functioning within a formal structure, as in the<br/>\n&gt; coordination and direction of activities; (a child&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; brain has a formal structure at birth, and as his<br/>\n&gt; needs  from the world around him change, the<br/>\n&gt; organization in his brain adjusts/evolves to meet<br/>\n&gt; those needs)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Efficient and methodical (a child&#39;s thoughts are<br/>\n&gt; efficient -- for meeting the natural environment of<br/>\n&gt; being a child, it&#39;s the unnatural demands of school<br/>\n&gt; that are inefficient)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Put together into an orderly, functional, structured<br/>\n&gt; whole;arranged in a coherent form;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; again -- coherent and functional for whom?  For the<br/>\n&gt; child, the evolving organization of his brain is<br/>\n&gt; perfectly functional and coherent for his natural<br/>\n&gt; needs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here is where definitions get schooly:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; systematized;  Arranged in a desired pattern or<br/>\n&gt; structure;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What makes it okay for any other person to devine<br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s a desirable pattern, structure or system for an<br/>\n&gt; individual brain?  Why do schools/teachers or even<br/>\n&gt; parents get to decide how another person&#39;s brain<br/>\n&gt; should work, and when?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; About boundaries -- those are constantly changing,<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t they?  I remember when people scoffed to ever<br/>\n&gt; think a computer could be made small enough to fit<br/>\n&gt; into a person&#39;s hand (then, they occupied entire rooms<br/>\n&gt; with cabinets of reel-to-reel tapes).  For thousands<br/>\n&gt; of years people believed flight was impossible, that<br/>\n&gt; travel in cars at speeds greater then 15mph would<br/>\n&gt; cause physical injury.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In earlier times we lived with other boundaries,<br/>\n&gt; expaned by things we take for granted today -- <br/>\n&gt; electricity, telephone, internal combustion engines,<br/>\n&gt; steam driven motors.  Many of those boundaries were<br/>\n&gt; overcome by people who were deemed to have<br/>\n&gt; &#39;unorganized&#39; brains, were eccentric or lived lives<br/>\n&gt; outside the norm.  Where would be if those people&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; brains had been organized within the boundaries of<br/>\n&gt; their time?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Life brings enough boundaries of its own, children<br/>\n&gt; with developing awareness don&#39;t need us to add<br/>\n&gt; unnatural boundaries.

To get a new toy, an m&m, a sticker, a hug.  None of <br/>\nthose things are contigent on putting the toy away.  The teacher might <br/>\nas well have demanded they touch their nose after they are done playing <br/>\nwith a toy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is just now understanding we brush our teeth so our teeth stay <br/>\nhealthy but only because his teeth hurt him now and he tolerates the <br/>\nbrushing 10% of the time because he wants that &quot;invisible sticky layer <br/>\nof harmful bacteria&quot; to go away.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s funny that my son is a &quot;Rule Boy,&quot; too.
