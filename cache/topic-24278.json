And while I did go and read some of the newspaper <br/>\narticles today, and I felt so sad for all the people involved, I don&#39;t think <br/>\nthat the story is applicable to me or my family. I&#39;m not going to set myself <br/>\nin opposition to Simon or to Linnaea. If Linnaea or Simon are dating at 14, <br/>\nthen I will invite their girlfriend or boyfriend over for dinner and to play <br/>\ngames with us in the evening and to be apart of our life. And I won&#39;t push <br/>\nthem into sneaking around and climbing in and out of windows.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight this very minute, Linnaea has just invited me to join a chat with her <br/>\nand her friend. Her friend would never dream of asking her mom to join, but <br/>\nLinnaea likes my company. And that is real, and that is true, and that is my <br/>\nunschooling life in action.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24244,"nextTopicId":24242}}
