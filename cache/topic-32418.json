I put a lot of soapy, bubbly warm water in a bowl and they stick their feet in. Sometimes they let me wash other areas as well in this way. Works great while watching TV. My boys (3 and 6) go through long periods of not bathing. In the winter, yes, months can go by. My little one still likes to play in the water though, mostly the bathroom sink. <br/>\nYesterday they came up with a fun game. They filled the sink with soap and water, pretended it was snow and put on a warm snowy coat as they called it with soap horns and soap hats on their hair. They played like that for a  good half hour with my older one exclaiming later: look how shiny we are now. And I have barely seen them so clean. Any type of outdoor water play works well for now too -<br/>\nI am always amazed as to how long they can go without them actuallly looking dirty. Even their hair does not get greasy or yucky. My 3 y.o. once put coconut oil all over his hair. After two days the oil had absorbed into his hair and it looked fresh and clean, without having to rinse anything out. Flour and water though was a bit trickier -<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nMara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: guideforthree &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:guideforthree@...\">guideforthree@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 6, 2008 3:15:47 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Bath strike<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Adrean Clark&quot; <br/>\n&lt;adreanaline@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jael is going through a bath strike now.

If he&#39;s over<br/>\nabout age 10 (I didn&#39;t notice an age mentioned), that&#39;s different than<br/>\nif he&#39;s only 6 or 7. My DS is almost 10 and he&#39;ll sniff his armpits<br/>\noccasionally to decide whether he needs a shower or not (which I find<br/>\nhumorous and a little tinged with &quot;My baby is growing up&quot;). There have<br/>\nbeen times when he&#39;s gotten really grubby (mud, grass stains, dust,<br/>\ndirt, you name it) and didn&#39;t want to bathe. So, I suggested a washcloth<br/>\nbath. While he watches his choice of TV show or movie, I (careful not to<br/>\nobstruct his view) wash one part of him at a time. He gets clean (which<br/>\nis nice since I don&#39;t like grubby feets on my sheets, when he&#39;s sleeping<br/>\nin my bed) and his time isn&#39;t interrupted. For hair washing, when he<br/>\ndoes bathe or shower, we have a shampoo that he chose (cherry vanilla<br/>\nscent) and I&#39;ll give him a folded over washcloth to cover his eyes so<br/>\nnothing gets in and we pat his face dry at the end just in case of<br/>\ndrips. Something that really tipped the scales with DS was a couple<br/>\nyears ago, we were at a KOA kampground and the cabin we got was actually<br/>\nhandicapped-accessible - there was a bench seat in the walk-in shower<br/>\nand it had dual shower heads so DS could sit and aim the lower shower<br/>\nhead at his chest. He loved it! When we got home, we went out as soon as<br/>\nthe budget allowed and got a kit to turn our standard shower into a dual<br/>\nhead setup - we can run the top, the bottom, or both and each head has a<br/>\nfew different spray settings. The bottom one doubles as a hand held too.<br/>\nDS is now more likely to shower than to bathe because he has this<br/>\nflexible arrangement (and sometimes we close the drain and set the<br/>\nhandheld down in the bottom of the tub and it acts as a fountain while<br/>\nit fills and DS plays in the water) [parenthetically, I like having the<br/>\nlower one for when I&#39;m shaving my legs in the shower, I can keep a nice<br/>\nflow of water over the area without having water cascading over my<br/>\nface].<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, long story longer, maybe a discussion (if he&#39;s open to it) of what<br/>\nkinds of things he&#39;d like (different soaps perhaps - DS likes the<br/>\ncucumber melon body wash we use and we have one of those puffs that soap<br/>\nup really fluffy). Perhaps offer, if he&#39;s grubby/stinky, to give him a<br/>\nonce-over with a warm washcloth some evening, even if he says to just<br/>\nwash his hands and feet.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
