I&#39;m printing out everyone&#39;s post to show to DH.&gt;&gt; I can&#39;t see any reason to leave him in school. In spite of health<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; issues you might have, would he not be happier at home?Yes, he would!  (My heart is breaking...)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Time to look at your son, not bend to pressure from school officials,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; other parents or anyone else. Your son needs to trust you to help him<br/>\n&gt;&gt; be happy.That&#39;s why I think unschooling is so good.  Thanks for all the wonderful reminders,and thanks for taking the time to read through my posts -- I really appreciate it!Shelley<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39199,"nextTopicId":39201}}
