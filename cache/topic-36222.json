This is one of those mental shifts. You want your<br/>\nkids to only eat as many sweets as you think are good for them. And<br/>\nyou want what you think to be right. So in your mind you do have a<br/>\nlimit. You just don&#39;t want to be the sweets Nazi. You want the kids<br/>\nto internalize what you believe is right and limit themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If my child wants to eat them all the day I made them, do I let him?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat will happen if he does eat them all in one day?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you make another batch and he eats that too? What will happen?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you buy ten bags of flour and keep making batches of cookies, how<br/>\nmany do you think he&#39;ll eat? All of them?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do that every day, do you think he&#39;d keep eating cookies<br/>\neveryday until he exploded?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; And he will, because *I&#39;VE* done it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you think he and you are the same person? Does he like the<br/>\nexact same things you do? Does he dislike the exact same things as<br/>\nyou do?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because something is possible, doesn&#39;t mean it will happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because we gave birth to them, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re our clones.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect you know all that. I&#39;m telling you the obvious *but*<br/>\nsometimes our fears can override our common sense. We&#39;ll set aside<br/>\nwhat makes sense to do some voodoo just to make sure some possible<br/>\nbad thing doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd questions make us squirm. We don&#39;t have the textbook and we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t study. What if we get the answer wrong???<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew I couldn&#39;t be trusted around candy. I had proof. I opened up a<br/>\nbag of Halloween candy before Halloween and in 2 or 3 days, 3 bags of<br/>\ncandy were gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut actually what I had proof of is how I react to deprivation. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t buy candy except at Halloween. It was the only time I could<br/>\nget it so *of course* I packed in as much as I could before it<br/>\ndisappeared for another year.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I gave myself permission to have candy. If I finished one bag<br/>\n(Almond M&Ms were irresistible at the time) I promised myself I could<br/>\nhave another. It did take 3 bags! but I did get over the craving. We<br/>\nnow buy bags of Dove milk chocolate miniatures and have Ghirardelli<br/>\nchocolate bits in the freezer. And I can go days without eating any.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Or do we just all dig in a finish it in a day and then wait for a few <br/>\ndays to make more?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy wait a few days? Make 4 dozen.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were thirsty would you have only one sip today then another<br/>\ntomorrow even though there&#39;s an unlimited amount coming from the tap?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou  *could* drink water by the gallon. Do you? *Is* it just because<br/>\nwater isn&#39;t as tasty as cookies? Most people would say that&#39;s true<br/>\nbut most people don&#39;t have a tap of running cookies freely<br/>\naccessible ;-) So they&#39;re making assumptions without actually<br/>\ntesting. They don&#39;t know what they&#39;re like when cookies are as easy<br/>\nto get as water. They only know what they&#39;re like when cookies appear<br/>\nlike an oasis in a desert.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And if the obvious conclusion was always the true answer, no one<br/>\nwould have ever questioned whether the sun goes around the earth,<br/>\nsince we can see that it does, plain as day! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My kids eat plenty of good stuff, but I don&#39;t know how to make sure <br/>\nthey don&#39;t get too many sweets.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t know because you&#39;re using your external monitor to judge<br/>\nwhat&#39;s going on inside of someone else. Of course you can&#39;t know. So<br/>\nparents make wild guesses. Or use their &quot;gut instinct&quot;. Or look to<br/>\nexperts to pass on their wild guesses or gut instincts so parents<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* we couldn&#39;t self regulate, *if* we needed experts to tell us<br/>\nwhat we should and shouldn&#39;t eat, how would our species have survived<br/>\nlong enough to create experts?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a mainstream article in the NY Times about eating that was<br/>\nactually very close to what we discuss here:<br/>\n<br/>\n6 Food Mistakes Parents Make<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/3m4lgf\">http://tinyurl.com/3m4lgf</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(You may need to register to view it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; do you only have a certain number of cookies available for that day <br/>\n(for everyone, not just the kids...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something Pam wrote about TV but it applies to food and<br/>\neverything else too. Which is the really cool thing about philosophy!<br/>\nThe principles that work in one area can make our view of another<br/>\narea clearer.<br/>\n<br/>\nEconomics<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/t/economics\">http://sandradodd.com/t/economics</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In other words, will they stop eating 5 at a time if the cookies are <br/>\nthere and available,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, what will happen if they eat 5 at a time? What if they eat a<br/>\ndozen? Your fears are stopping you from doing ... what exactly? Think<br/>\nabout it! Really. Do you fear that if you let them eat 5 dozen<br/>\ncookies that they won&#39;t ever eat anything else?<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect the questions are sounding snarky as though I&#39;m saying &quot;Are<br/>\nyou so dim as to believe what conventional parents believe?&quot; But they<br/>\naren&#39;t. They&#39;re honest questions. Most parents don&#39;t think. They<br/>\nfear. And they reach for answers that will soothe their fears. We ask<br/>\npeople to think! :-) And ask people to try it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat *will* happen if you make 5 dozen cookies every day for the next<br/>\n5 weeks? Why would parents be afraid to try it? What do they fear<br/>\nwould happen? (No one needs to answer that here. It&#39;s just something<br/>\nto ponder why it would seem a better idea to ask strangers than to<br/>\nreally think about something and try it out. It&#39;s just pure fear that<br/>\nmakes us imagine that opening the flood gate of cookies will make<br/>\nkids never want to stop stuffing them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m betting you can&#39;t even make it 2 days before the kids say &quot;STOP!<br/>\nLet me have something besides these darn cookies!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t trust them,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it is that you don&#39;t trust them! Clear thinking is helped<br/>\n*hugely* by honesty. Parents are trained to say things in a nice way,<br/>\nto cover up the truth. And it really muddies thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many parents have said &quot;I asked nicely and he still didn&#39;t do<br/>\nit.&quot; Well if you *asked* then one acceptable answer was no. If no<br/>\nwasn&#39;t an acceptable answer, then it was a demand in a frilly dress.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake off the frilly dress and let those thoughts run naked. It&#39;s lots<br/>\neasier to see what they really look like without their costumes on.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; but that if they&#39;re anything like me, then cookies it is, for <br/>\nbreakfast, lunch, and supper (and I DO eat them at every meal at this <br/>\npoint....)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you don&#39;t trust yourself either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m betting you can&#39;t make it through 2 days of nothing but cookies<br/>\neither!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; So help me - should I stop?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think? &lt;eg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTry it.
