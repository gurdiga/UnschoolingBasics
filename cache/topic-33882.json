It &quot;speaks&quot; <br/>\nfor all homeschoolers in SC.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was the most horrible experience. It was like a friend of mine, <br/>\nChristian Thee, described a social event years ago: He was in New York <br/>\nCity at a party. In an all-white apartment. White walls, white carpet, <br/>\nwhite drapes, white grand piano, with a white standard poodle. The <br/>\npoodle started vomiting right there in the middle of the white room. No <br/>\none moved. It was surreal---like a train wreck, no one could look away. <br/>\nDozens of people there, surrounded by *white* as this dog barfed all <br/>\nover the carpet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t leave. I was transfixed on this spectacle.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a Christian convention---but they don&#39;t say that <br/>\nspecifically---they just assume everyone who homeschools does it <br/>\nbecause they were called by the Lord.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the breakfast I attended, the speaker wanted us all to know that we <br/>\nwere no different than the women beside us. ALL of us hated our <br/>\nspouses. ALL of us wished our children had never been born. ALL of us <br/>\nworried that we were failing our children. ALL of us knew we were bad <br/>\nteachers. ALL of us thought everyone else had it all together. ALL of <br/>\nus were unhappy and miserable.<br/>\n<br/>\n******And it was all OK!*******<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren were kept separate from the adults. In different <br/>\nbuilding---*unless* they were glued to their parents&#39; sides. There was <br/>\nno light in these kids&#39; eyes. It was just awful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it weren&#39;t so awful, I&#39;d suggest you all go to one---that way you&#39;d <br/>\nknow that what you&#39;re doing is GREAT! You&#39;d certainly appreciate the <br/>\nLive and Learn Conference! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis experience will last me for a long, long time. I *know* that my <br/>\nhusband is wonderful and that my kids are incredibly special and adored <br/>\nand that my life is pretty damned sweet. I also *know* that I&#39;m the 1% <br/>\nthat loves her life and is LYING! (Yep---he said that!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway---it doesn&#39;t take much to remind me of this, but this convention <br/>\nwas like a huge shot in the arm of what I DON&#39;T want for my family. <br/>\nTheir whole lives are built on fear.

Turn out just fine i mean.  I knew it.  It took me an awful<br/>\nlong time to change it (6 years after my first son was born).  But i<br/>\nknew I wasn&#39;t fine and neither were my kids.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I&#39;ve spent a lot of my life trying to be better at a lot of things, <br/>\n&gt; and when I realized that I could be a better parent TOO---well, I just <br/>\n&gt; latched on to *that* idea! But I had no mental picture of what that <br/>\n&gt; looked like. My childhood was filled with spankings---and a good bit of <br/>\n&gt; sarcasm, so I spanked and was sarcastic. I never thought to do anything <br/>\n&gt; different.

The sarcasm thing?<br/>\n My whole family is one big sarcastic mess!  It&#39;s near impossible to<br/>\nget away from.  No one ever says what they mean.  Losing it has been<br/>\nan everyday struggle.  I have to consciously remember to speak clearly.   <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But we were all parented a lot longer than we were schooled. It takes <br/>\n&gt; time. If you &quot;see&quot; it early---WOW! But if you don&#39;t, it&#39;s not <br/>\n&gt; impossible; it just may take longer. &lt;G&gt; But as soon as you make that <br/>\n&gt; decision to BE kinder and gentler and more patient and more <br/>\n&gt; trusting...as soon as you know that&#39;s what you *want*, it gets easier <br/>\n&gt; and easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*sigh*  It&#39;s so true.

That&#39;s probably one I&#39;ll refer to a lot.  :-)  That&#39;s the<br/>\none thing I worry about the most I think.  Is having my family baggage<br/>\nspill all over the airport!  I think it used to.  Not so much anymore.<br/>\nI still say my mother was the David Koresh of parenthood.  I work<br/>\nHARD to not carry around HER baggage.  Guilt, control, lies,<br/>\nselfishness, etc.etc.etc.  Unschooling has brought an awful lot of<br/>\npositive change into my life.

I choose to move<br/>\n&gt; forward with what I need to create but the comparisons DO surface<br/>\n&gt; occasionally.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This has been really hard for me to get rid of too.  I want me AND my<br/>\nchildren to create freely without feeling like they to have to look at<br/>\nthe next person to see if theirs is better.  I was the<br/>\ndaydreamer/artist in school. Boy was all of that squashed in a hurry.<br/>\n I gave my kids a giant space on the wall in our media-room to<br/>\npaint/draw/color on.

That was the big piece I was<br/>\n&gt; robbed of in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess I was still sort of seeing deschooling as just an academic<br/>\nthing.  Maybe the word &quot;school&quot; had something to do with it.  I&#39;ve<br/>\ndescribed it before as the transitional period between when one lives<br/>\nas if school exists and when one begins to live freely as if school<br/>\ndidn&#39;t exist.  We got that.

AFTER you <br/>\nchange *your* paradigm.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took us 18 months, and Cam had only been in school eight years. But <br/>\nit took me a l-o-n-g time to quit worrying about things: to quit <br/>\nreading short stories to him every morning and asking for a summary <br/>\nafterwards, to quit pointing out that packing the car was geometry, to <br/>\nquit &quot;finding&quot; the &quot;academics&quot; in everything, to quit assuring him and <br/>\nmyself (and anyone who would listen!) that he *could* learn just fine <br/>\nwithout school or school-at-home.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs *soon* as I listened to the advice I&#39;d been given online (by Joyce <br/>\nand Pam and Sandra and Anne, and others), he (we) started to deschool. <br/>\nUp until that point, *I* had been hindering his deschooling by pointing <br/>\nout all the &quot;schooly&quot; things that he was doing everyday.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* had to get past that; and the second I *did*, we were on our way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the deschooling *begins* AFTER you quit worrying and nagging and <br/>\n&quot;teaching.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThings could be going along swimmingly, then you panic and start <br/>\nworrying and voice (or unconsciously give off signals) that this is not <br/>\nworking. Then you need to go back to zero to start counting the number <br/>\nof months it takes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could have done it in just a few months had I trusted Cameron and <br/>\nunschooling.
