What we&#39;re advocating, is<br/>\nequal freedom for children that adults have. What we&#39;re talking about<br/>\nis CHOICES and freedom, not no limits.<br/>\nLIFE has limits.<br/>\nSociety has limits that actually make sense. If they don&#39;t, I ignore<br/>\nthem. Like the idea that children have to go to school to<br/>\nlearn...that&#39;s an idea (a limiting one) I choose to ignore.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would a child WANT to jump off a high building or bridge? None of<br/>\nmy children have ever wanted to harm themselves knowingly. If they&#39;re<br/>\ntoo little to be aware of the dangers, it&#39;s your job to keep them<br/>\nsafe. That&#39;s what they&#39;d WANT you to do if they understood the<br/>\npotential for  harm.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;d keep an adult safe that was unaware of dangers, right? Providing<br/>\nsafety is a parent&#39;s job. Nobody is saying &quot;no limits&quot;. We ARE saying<br/>\n&quot;rid yourself of ARBITRARY limits&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nArbitrary limits are there only because an adult chooses to impose<br/>\ntheir will on a child. They don&#39;t necessarily make sense. If a limit<br/>\nmakes sense then by all means, impose it!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m truly exhausted, truly needing some quiet and calm, there are<br/>\nlimits to what I can assist my children with. That&#39;s a real limit and<br/>\nchildren are pretty understanding about that if you&#39;re generous with<br/>\nthem. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen one of my children chooses to ignore personal boundaries and hit<br/>\nor otherwise try to harm someone, I stop them. There are a load of<br/>\ngood reasons to limit a person from doing harmful things.<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic places have limits. If my children want to scream and run up<br/>\nthe aisles at the grocery store, making other people miserable, there<br/>\nwill be some creative problem solving to figure out ways to avoid that<br/>\nproblem. I wouldn&#39;t take my child to a restaraunt and expect the other<br/>\npatrons to put up with whatever my child felt like imposing upon them.<br/>\nThey have a right to peace also. One persons freedom ends where<br/>\nanother begins....we need to honor other human beings space and sanity<br/>\ntoo. That will create natural limits. <br/>\n<br/>\nLimits for real reasons that make sense....well, make sense.<br/>\nIt&#39;s our job to help our children figure out how to work with, and be<br/>\ncreative or honor those limits. Limits that are decided for the child<br/>\nbecause the parent has a set of values that aren&#39;t very flexible,<br/>\naren&#39;t helpful. The child can&#39;t figure out their own balance, feel<br/>\nwhat THEIR body needs and learn in their own way if the parent decides<br/>\nwhen they&#39;ll sleep, what they&#39;ll eat, when they should learn certain<br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12199,"nextTopicId":11818}}
