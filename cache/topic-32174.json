You just trust that they will <br/>\nlearn<br/>\nwhen they are ready.  Am I thinking about this the right way?

When they are ready to wean or sleep on their <br/>\nown, my<br/>\nchildren give definite signs of readiness, as opposed to saying outright<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m ready to wean now.&quot;  (Although I don&#39;t doubt that some children <br/>\nmight<br/>\nsay this.  But mine never did.)  So do I, then, look for similar signs <br/>\nfor<br/>\nreading readiness?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nKind of. But I remember when Duncan was just starting, he didn&#39;t really <br/>\nshow &quot;signs of readiness.&quot; It was more like showing &quot;signs of already <br/>\nreading,&quot; on a small scale---or maybe a lower scale. He started <br/>\npointing out McDonald&#39;s signs on the highway. Or saying &quot;stop&quot; at stop <br/>\nsigns. He&#39;d ask what something said or asked what does _ _ _ _ spell? <br/>\nIt was very obvious he was making connections. And the connections <br/>\nstarted to get overwhelming. Then they seemed to stop. Dead. Then <br/>\nslowly we saw more ability. Then nothing. Then reading short books. <br/>\nThen asking us to buy books. &lt;g&gt; Then seemingly no interest in words or <br/>\nreading or books. Then more. Then almost no asking for help on video <br/>\ngames or computer games. Eventually it snowballed, and he can read <br/>\nalmost everything. And he writes online to gamers or in emails. With <br/>\nhelp form us sometimes---sometimes he has it all just fine. Depends on <br/>\nwhat he has to say. It&#39;s been VERY organic and fun to experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when I see those signs, is that when it&#39;s ok to<br/>\npresent &quot;schooly&quot; looking things (as long as they are still <br/>\ninterested)?  Or<br/>\nis it never ok to present these things?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you feel the need to present &quot;schooly&quot; looking things? What kind <br/>\nof things?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would depend on the child. We certainly talk a lot about <br/>\nlanguage and words and grammar here &#39;cause I like to. &lt;g&gt; We *play* <br/>\nwith words.
