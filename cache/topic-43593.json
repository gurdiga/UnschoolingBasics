There was a time when most of the stuff on the list was Megan&#39;s, but now that she&#39;s older that need to aquire has lessened.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do remember it starting around age 5 and being a VERY big thing in our lives and it did take some adjusting. We discovered unschooling around that time and many of the suggestions were so helpful - but it seems that 5 or so is an age for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started Megan&#39;s allowance then - $30 per month, all at once.  She was really into Webkinz and my intention was that she could buy a Webkinz and still have some money left over for other things. <br/>\n<br/>\nOver the past year or so, I noticed that her allowance went entirely for one video game each month and then she&#39;d spend the rest of the month asking when she&#39;d get her allowance again. So we recently raised her allowance to $50/month. We&#39;re in a position to do it and I let her know that if finances get tight again, it may have to be reduced (as a last resort...but Dennis was laid off last year and spent 3 months unemployed...it is unlikely to happen again).<br/>\n<br/>\nLast month she bought a game ($40) and still had money left over. The leftover money lasted most of the month. I think she bought a stuffed animal with the last $10.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis month she bought $12 toys for herself, her sister & her dad.  She also bought two bags of Combos (a pretzel-type snack) - she still has $12 left and is holding onto it for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I&#39;d ever pay Megan to do chores or help with chores. It makes me feel like that would put make part of our relationship conditional. I could see getting her a present or a small surprise as a genuine thank you for helping...but I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d put a price on something before hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nGwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: &quot;allowance&quot; vs. extra work","postDate":"1270920262","msgId":43622,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhwcWM4NitkMmtxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhwbnN0aytvazNiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43620,"nextInTopic":43623,"prevInTime":43620,"nextInTime":43623,"topicId":43593,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... **************** That s a good point.

Also, I do like to get a lot of responses, because I do like to see what other people have to say and how they say it.  That&#39;s how I can find what speaks to me most.  Another reason I cross-post is because I&#39;m not very good at taking my thoughts and writing them down (which is pretty obvious), so it takes a long time to figure out what I want to say and even then it&#39;s never truly what I mean to say.

Cut out pictures of toys from a Toys R Us flyer or other flyers in the newspaper, mailings, etc. Sometimes it is just the wanting that needs to be expressed. I know this was true for my 7 y/o son during the Christmas season. He wanted everything he saw advertised on TV. So we made a list of all the things he wanted. When he saw a new toy/game he would ask me to add it to the list. There were at least 20-30 or more items. When it came time for me to go shopping I double checked with him what he wanted. We went thru the list together and he ended up saying, &quot;No, I decided I don&#39;t want that,&quot; to most of the items on the list. *Phew*, I thought to myself. Even some of the stuff we gave him, like an electric guitar, he only used once or twice. It seems it was more about the wanting. <br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\nSharon</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":302010303,"authorName":"sharon","from":"&quot;sharon&quot; &lt;1drflmthr@...&gt;","profile":"sharonjemerson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: &quot;allowance&quot; vs. extra work","postDate":"1270827248","msgId":43610,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhwbmhkZytnOHNzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEMxMjJDRDg2LTc3RTctNDY2NC1BMzcwLUEyOTExNjg1OUZCOEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":43608,"nextInTopic":43611,"prevInTime":43609,"nextInTime":43611,"topicId":43593,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for explaining this Joyce.

He wants things to fulfill needs of connecting with others and pretending (put he can pretend with paper and pencil...cheap!!!!). However, my middle son is more of the physical type. It&#39;s not enough to just look at or talk about a given item. He REALLY needs to physically interact with it. This is soooo difficult sometimes. But I feel like I&#39;m understanding him more every day. I have to provide PLENTY of physical outlets for him to curb some of his intensity towards things we can&#39;t afford at the time.  I don&#39;t bring him to the store unless I feel like his &quot;physical cup&quot; is pretty full. It&#39;s not easy for him to go into a situation feeling so &quot;needy&quot;. He has also started trusting me more that we will work towards buying things. We take pictures of what he wants on my phone and try to leave the store with something inexpensive and usually physical....sometimes just<br/>\n some gum will do for him.  He also enjoys handling money. We have rolled coins, folded money, bought rolls of tickets to play with, and made our own money (very soft...especially for extra sensory input)...oh, and he loves to play with receipts. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t do allowance.

If it was written down on<br/>\na list that he could look at (even before he could read), that was<br/>\nhelpful for him. Then, when we did have a bit of spare spending money<br/>\navailable, he could look at the list and prioritize things - maybe that<br/>\nX he wanted last month has been superseded by Y last week, then again<br/>\nmaybe Z from 3 months ago has risen in importance lately. That idea of a<br/>\n&#39;wish list&#39; and prioritizing things (and no priority was set in stone,<br/>\nit was all fluid) created a pattern for him - when he was about 6, he<br/>\ngot a BUNCH of spendables (cash, gift cards) for Christmas. We asked<br/>\nwhere he wanted to use them (VISA gift cards can be used anywhere!) So,<br/>\nwe went to the store he wanted to go to. He asked me to bring a pen and<br/>\npaper to make a list of the stuff he wanted while he shopped so he<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t miss anything. We browsed aisle after aisle. I&#39;d jot a note of<br/>\nthe item, price, any other notes he wanted. I figured at some point he&#39;d<br/>\ngrab a couple things and we&#39;d be good to go. I figured wrong. After we<br/>\nhad a list of about a dozen items, he said Okay, I&#39;m done, let&#39;s go. Uh,<br/>\nwait, you didn&#39;t actually BUT anything, I&#39;m confused. But out we went to<br/>\nthe car. Once we were there, we sat and prioritize the items, the<br/>\nprices, etc. I figured Oh, okay, he&#39;s going to figure out how much stuff<br/>\nhe can get, the best arrangement to get the most he can. Cool. Wrong<br/>\nagain mom-o. After we sorted the list and he was satisfied with it, we<br/>\nwent back in. He picked ONE item (and not the most expensive one either)<br/>\nand said let&#39;s go - so we checked out with that one item. Those gifts<br/>\nlasted probably 2 or 3 months as he gradually worked through his<br/>\npriority list and other things that came up along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been an interesting journey, with DS and money stuff.

I&#39;ll keep that in mind.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, unfortunately my husband just took a pretty significant pay cut (though he&#39;s leaving a job he has hated for the last 10 years and has really caused a lot of stress in and out of the home, so it&#39;s a good thing, too - LOL).

She just loves money - LOL.  She spends her days counting coins to see if she can get a dollar or two (her favorite is &quot;I&#39;ll give you 3 quarters for a dollar.&quot; and she knows all too well that there are 4 quarters in a dollar - LOL).  She also has free access to one of our extra coin jars, to dig around in for extra money.  I know a lot of this does have to do with me and my dh working out our money issues and with our recent cut in salary, so over time things should get better.

She asked if she did many things around the house (i.e. clean the fridge, etc.) could she get more money.  I told her that there were other ways she could make money, such as through selling her old toys or clothes on ebay or making jewelry or other things to sell at our local farmer&#39;s market or on ebay.
