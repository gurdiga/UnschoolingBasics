But<br/>\nI think more importantly, why do you feel the need to eat dinner together<br/>\nevery day?  All those studies done on families who eat dinner together<br/>\ngetting better grades, doing less drugs, or what-have-you are based on<br/>\nschooled kids who have limited time to spend talking with their parents. It<br/>\nis the kids who have some type of connection and communication with their<br/>\nparents who are less apt to do drugs as an escape and who are more apt to<br/>\nwork hard for good grades because their parents value it and they know that.<br/>\nAs an unschooled family we spend TONS of time together.  We connect in<br/>\nvarious ways through out the day.  I listen to my kids while we play a game<br/>\nor groom our horses or watch TV.  Dinner time isn&#39;t the only time we come<br/>\nface to face and talk and connect. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason that I write this is because I too felt the need to have family<br/>\ndinners and have everyone sit down at one point.  I think it was those<br/>\nstudies lurking somewhere in my head combined with the importance my family<br/>\nor origin placed on dinner time.  I didn&#39;t stop to think that those things<br/>\ndidn&#39;t apply to my family and I stressed a lot about it.   When I let that<br/>\ngo and stopped worrying about who ate what at what time and if they&#39;d be<br/>\nhungry for dinner, it made my home a more joyful place.  When I cook dinner<br/>\nmost often everyone sits down to eat it.  Sometimes they don&#39;t and that&#39;s<br/>\nok.  If they were busy on the computer someone might take theirs in to the<br/>\ncomputer room to eat.  Sometimes I will too and sometimes one of the kids<br/>\nwill ask me to eat with them.  I always do if they want to.  I put the left<br/>\novers in the fridge and I&#39;ll happily get some for anyone who wants some<br/>\nlater on.  (if I am not exhausted and heading up to bed.sometimes then I do<br/>\nit a little grumpily, but I&#39;m working on that.)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] re: food","postDate":"1154756202","msgId":16286,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU1MEE4QjVBLTYzRTItNEM0Ni1CRDc4LTAwNUJBQjM0OEVDOEBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwODA1MDExNTU0LjcyMTUyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzOTA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwODA1MDExNTU0LjcyMTUyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzOTA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16282,"nextInTopic":16287,"prevInTime":16285,"nextInTime":16287,"topicId":16262,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Our three yo sits long enough to play in the food and run.

The thing that I believe is important to you<br/>\nabout &quot;dinner time&quot; is that it is the mainstream &quot;family time.&quot;  In an<br/>\nunschooling household that doesn&#39;t have to be that way.  As he gets older<br/>\nand he sees those that want to sit at the table enjoying a family activity<br/>\nhe may sit with you at the table.  He might not.  He might eat with you and<br/>\nagain he might not.  Forcing him there even for 5 or 10 minutes may be very<br/>\ndifficult for him.  If being together as a family is important then find<br/>\nother ways that you can do that at other times.

We (my family) are <br/>\nfairly healthy eaters; mostly vegetarian with lots of vegetables, <br/>\nbeans, and whole grains.  My sister, who we are staying with at the <br/>\nmoment (Robin, not Ren), survives on frozen dinners, chips, sugary <br/>\ncereal, etc.  Let me preface though that even though we mostly eat <br/>\nhealthy I always keep chips, soda, poptarts, etc in my pantry for the <br/>\nkids if they want it.  Since being at my sisters I haven&#39;t stocked her <br/>\nfridge like I normally stock mine.  Yesterday Calista (7 years old) <br/>\ncame to me because she was hungry looking for something to eat so I <br/>\ngave her the choices that were in the cupboards and fridge.  She burst <br/>\ninto tears and said, &quot;Mom, I want something HEALTHY!!!&quot;  They are <br/>\ntired of eating processed food and her body is screaming at her to <br/>\nstop!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t monitor my kids choice of foods AT ALL!  We talk about what <br/>\nfood does after you swallow it and how it might make you feel but I <br/>\nhave plenty of junk food in my house.  I also have very healthy food <br/>\nout that is easy to get to; often leaving plates of fruits and <br/>\nvegetables out on the table to nibble on all day along with the M&M&#39;s <br/>\nand soda.  Most of the time the fruits and vegetables disappear and <br/>\nthe M&M&#39;s are still there.  They do learn to listen to their bodies <br/>\nbut sometimes it takes a little bit of time to figure it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember one time we made homemade dougnuts and Kevin ate 8 or 9 of <br/>\nthem and spent most of the night puking.
