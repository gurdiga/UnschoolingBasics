On the down side, it could end your hopes of homeschooling - after all if school goes well, why not just keep going? Of course, if your child has a bad experience with school you can always pull her out later, but that&#39;s something to think about. This is where a lot of &quot;unschooling from birth&quot; families stop unschooling - at the transition to school age. Its Why some unschoolers flinch at &quot;unschooling from birth&quot;. You don&#39;t really start until you cross this big, big hurdle. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; BTW, she has been going to a play-based preschool for this school year and last. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************<br/>\n<br/>\nThe downside of relying on these kinds of resources is they stop you from thinking. Its easy to simply use them and stop looking for alternatives to school, especially in terms of social connections. It does take some effort, living outside the system, to find ways for your kids to meet and connect with others. That&#39;s one of the reasons older kids sometimes choose school - lack of other social opportunities. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess my question is how might a school as I&#39;ve described  take away from the trust and connection developed by radical unschooling, not to mention whole life learning?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************<br/>\n <br/>\nSome school families have great relationships. You can certainly take a great deal of unschooling advice to heart on the subject of relationships without unschooling! Keep putting your relationship with your daughter first, and don&#39;t fret so much about whether what you&#39;re doing is unschooling. In another four years, the question of whether or not you are unschooling may have cleared up on its own ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;And, how much of her social being should I be considering in this decision?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can you find other ways for her to socialize? Does she prefer to socialize with kids as opposed to adults? Some kids have a strong preference for other kids, and that complicates things. If she doesn&#39;t prefer other kids, can you be more fun and engaged than you are? <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling AND going to school??","postDate":"1298385187","msgId":46230,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDMDlBMTA5LTM4NEEtNDBFNC1BNjAwLTcxQ0I4RkZDMjVGMkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJDQjJGODU2LTY1MTctNERFNC1BRUEyLTk0NDY5OTU0QTc0OEB5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGlqMHBhMCs0aWJtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RjFGMUIwQUEtNzVCRC00REFFLTg1NzgtODVBNUI3QzQ2NDVFQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8QkNCMkY4NTYtNjUxNy00REU0LUFFQTItOTQ0Njk5NTRBNzQ4QHlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":46229,"nextInTopic":46232,"prevInTime":46229,"nextInTime":46231,"topicId":46094,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The teachers there are facilitators more than teacher-y teachers.  Kids are not forced or required to do any activity at any given time, though there are options presented if they want.  Any interest shown in something is nurtured.  The kids are able to eat their lunches at anytime or go in or out into the edible organic garden at their whim.  We also never forced our daughter to go.  Any day she preferred to stay home, she could.  She is very social and an extrovert through and through.  Often on vacations whether to the beach or visiting relatives, she comments on missing her friends or wanting to know when she would get to go back to school.  She even told me that she liked me today which I took as a huge compliment as she often already says she loves me.  But, it&#39;s clear that I&#39;m not her playmate and that she likes having time with them.

It&#39;s a group of parents and kids that we&#39;ve known for a couple years and we do it in a home, and they know that our son needs to check out of activities and do his own thing, so it&#39;s fine.  And parents are always present, no drop off, which is really important to our family.    <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is a wonderful GDI but has many traits that I think would cause him to fail out of even the most liberal play based preschool.  He responds poorly to any expectation that he should do any one thing at any particular time, so if there was any of that expectation even at a small level, like that he should come in from playing for snack time, I think we would be talked to about him.  Let&#39;s just say that I&#39;m very glad to not have him in any official preschool.  I can see why boys who are placed into school often don&#39;t do well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess we are kind of unschooling and schooling, but the thing is that I don&#39;t consider this co-op we&#39;re doing to be school, and I&#39;m not expecting some sort of education from it.  It&#39;s just fun and my son is enjoying it at the moment and he gets to hang out with and form stronger relationships with other kids.
