The results are not important to the<br/>\nstate at all - only that you have administered the test. There&#39;s no<br/>\nminimum level the students need to reach, and you can actually<br/>\ndetermine for yourself which grade level they&#39;ll be tested at. It&#39;s<br/>\nreally easy, no stress at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do the test *with* my boys. And the PASS test isn&#39;t timed, but if it<br/>\nwas, I would not set a timer. Seems silly to me. My oldest is now past<br/>\nthe age level for PASS. I&#39;m not sure what we&#39;re doing this year, but<br/>\nwhatever it is, it won&#39;t involve him sitting in a room by himself,<br/>\ntrying to beat a timer! Full access to information is how we live our<br/>\nlives, so it&#39;s how we take the test.
