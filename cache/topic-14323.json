I&#39;ve been crazy busy this past week <br/>\nwith VBS at church and just haven&#39;t been online much which has felt <br/>\nvery strange for me!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t DO summer anymore than we DO any other traditional school <br/>\nbreak.  Life doesn&#39;t stop during the summer.  We live and learn <br/>\nevery day of every year during our entire lifetime.  The whole point <br/>\nof unschooling is to learn to step away from the nonsensical method <br/>\nof viewing learning as being able to happen only in certain places <br/>\n(i.e. classrooms, labs, etc.) or at certain times (from Sept to May, <br/>\nMonday through Friday, 8am to 3pm).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing I see most newbies to unschooling misunderstand is <br/>\nthat life and learning happen without us pointing it out to one <br/>\nanother, whether to our spouses, friends, children, or whoever.  New <br/>\nunschoolers expect their children to choose to do schoolish things <br/>\nlike work through a Math textbook, study a certain time period in <br/>\nHistory perhaps through reading regular books, set up a Science <br/>\nexperiment, etc.  It truly helps to focus YOUR thinking away from <br/>\nschoolish things.  All the things we do in life can be categorized <br/>\nin some manner if you speak educationlese, but one wonders WHY you <br/>\nneed to do that?  For example, when you prepare your grocery list <br/>\nand complete your shopping, do you award yourself a grade or some <br/>\nother form of external reward for doing something in Home <br/>\nEconomics?  Do you consider your Math lessons done for the day when <br/>\nyou balance your checkbook?  Adults do not, normally, separate <br/>\neverything into subjects but we sure expect that of our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first started unschooling, I had to genuinely believe that it <br/>\nwas OKAY that my children may never, never do anything that looks <br/>\nlike schoolwork.  Over time, I&#39;ve become so excited by that fact <br/>\nthat I now take a double-look when I do see them choosing something <br/>\nthat looks like schoolwork!  *lol*  <br/>\n<br/>\nI may repeat this alot and it&#39;s also for my sake, but I think <br/>\nthe &#39;unschooling&#39; term is more for us parents trying to let go.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think of my kids as unschooling because they aren&#39;t trying to <br/>\nundo anything.  Instead, they are living life... actually WE are <br/>\nliving together and that encompasses so very much if you truly stop <br/>\nand marvel at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92643757,"authorName":"Leslie530@aol.com","from":"Leslie530@...","profile":"lescather","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] How do you &quot;do&quot; summer","postDate":"1149977962","msgId":14347,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMS41ZmE3N2JmOS4zMWJjOWY2YUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":14346,"nextInTopic":14352,"prevInTime":14346,"nextInTime":14348,"topicId":14323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/10/2006 4:35:17 P.M.
