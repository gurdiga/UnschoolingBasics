I had to fight and fight with the school to make sure they understood that the kids had NEVER been in an academic setting before....that I wasn&#39;t sure if Michelle even understood that she really was expected to finish worksheets even if she thought they were boring, that Danny is used to writing however he likes.....to just give them time.  They did and the kids are now wowing them...but it was a fight to get the school to give them room to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just an aside....Michelle loves doing homework sheets and Danny hates them so Michelle talked Danny out of his last night and she did them for him while he rode his bike.
