My name is Jody and I just joined this loop last week and <br/>\nWow does it really give me cause to look at my children with <br/>\ndifferent eyes!  I have 4 children ranging in ages from 11 to <br/>\n15mos.  We have been learning at home now for 4 years (my 2 older <br/>\nchildren did time in PS before I realized what I was doing!!)  <br/>\nHowever, before my baby was born, I attempted to do *school* at <br/>\nhome!!  Until, one day I couldn&#39;t figure out what exactly a <br/>\npredicate nominative was or exactly why someone would need to <br/>\nknow??  Then my baby was born and, well the rest is history (I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t get her stay on my school schedule ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nSo now we are unschoolers, always have been at heart, just afraid to <br/>\nfollow my heart.  And still have days wondering what exactly is <br/>\ngoing on here.  I just feel so busy with regular ordinary things: <br/>\nhelping the two smaller children get dressed, nursing the baby and <br/>\nfeeding the rest, washing dishes, washing clothes, that sometimes I <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel like I have spent enough quality time with them. Some <br/>\ndays we don&#39;t even manage to read together and they resist reading <br/>\nalone.  We live with my in-laws and my MIL refuses to let the <br/>\nchildren do anything in the kitchen and does not really like for <br/>\nthem to have any paints or playdough or anything that will *ruin* <br/>\nthe carpet (I spend a lot of time picking up after them in order to <br/>\nkeep the peace).  But we take many field trips and go to the park <br/>\nevery week and they play on the computer and watch t.v., but most of <br/>\nall they just like to pretend play.  Lately, though, I&#39;ve been <br/>\nhearing &quot;I&#39;m bored, there is nothing to do!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I have really enjoyed reading the past week and am getting a <br/>\nsense that any reservations I am having really have to do with me <br/>\nand my hang-ups or false ideas. Thanks for the suggested reading <br/>\nlist and thanks for taking your time to help me stay focused and <br/>\ncontinue to gain clarity about what I REALLY want for my <br/>\nchildren....a happiness and a joy for LIFE!!<br/>\n<br/>\nJody</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12616,"nextTopicId":12638}}
