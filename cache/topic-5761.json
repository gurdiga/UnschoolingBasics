Life has been <br/>\nvery demanding this past year or so.  A lot has changed, and I&#39;m at <br/>\na new spot in my journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs some of you know, I have seven children.  We are now down to a <br/>\nmere four living at home.  Talk about noise reduction!  Man, is it <br/>\nweird.  The oldest at home is Tammi.  She is 17 and will likely be <br/>\nmoved out by the fall.  This leaves us with three children.  Two are <br/>\nPSers, Amie - 15 and Andrew - 13. Our youngest, Adrian - 11 years, <br/>\nis my only unschooler.  We try to impliment unschooling in our <br/>\ngeneral lives despite the mix of education styles.  How freeing it <br/>\nis!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the &quot;new spot&quot; I mentioned is in relation to &quot;chores&quot;.  We <br/>\nhave had a system in place for years that seems a little out dated <br/>\nfor our lifestyle and family dynamics as they are now.  We used to <br/>\nhave the home divided into rooms.  Each child was responsible for <br/>\nthe maintenace of one room with the room assignment switching <br/>\nweekly.  It worked well for years.  Now it seems inappropriate and <br/>\nunworkable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m hoping that you all can/will share with me your unschooling <br/>\napproach to this aspect of life.  I&#39;d love to hear both what has <br/>\nworked and what hasn&#39;t and maybe the whys of it all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy goal in this transition is to create a relaxed atmosphere <br/>\ninvolving the care of our home while instilling a sense of pride and <br/>\nfamily in the respect of others and our belongings.  This is good <br/>\ntiming due to the current dynamics of our life and the fact that I <br/>\nnever really got to &quot;train up&quot; the younger ones anyway.  I&#39;d like <br/>\nfor us all to be involved in the process together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, reading suggestions are always welcome as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHANKS a bunch!<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5734,"nextTopicId":5783}}
