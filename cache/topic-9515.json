I have one daughter, seven months old, and we plan<br/>\nto unschool her from the beginning. I&#39;m anxious about how my family is going<br/>\nto react, but I&#39;m determined to do it anyway, because I strongly believe in<br/>\nthe personal, social and political benefits. I&#39;m nervous though!<br/>\n<br/>\nSince becoming a new mother, I have not been part of any community or known<br/>\nany other parents besides my own and my partner&#39;s. I&#39;ve lurked in some<br/>\ncommunities, mostly message boards such as mothering.com and<br/>\nbreastfeeding.com, but felt I just didn&#39;t fit in. I shared some of the<br/>\nvalues of the general community, but not others, and some I felt a constant<br/>\nurge to argue with. I didn&#39;t want to argue, though, I just wanted a place to<br/>\ndiscuss the parenting issues I find interesting and important, and perhaps<br/>\nmeet likeminded people.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I&#39;m delurking because what I&#39;m reading here makes me feel like it&#39;s a<br/>\ngood fit for where my head&#39;s at right now, as I prepare to start this crazy<br/>\njourney. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI watch myself a lot, with my daughter, and I see that I try to control her<br/>\nfor no reason sometimes even now, when she&#39;s pre-verbal and just starting to<br/>\nexplore the world. I&#39;ll take her hand to show her how to do something. And<br/>\nnow I stop myself and say, no, she pretty much does exactly what she wants<br/>\nto do and immediately lets you know if she needs something to change. She<br/>\nlets me know if she wants me to help her do whatever it is she feels like<br/>\ndoing next, or just share it with her. And I learn to sit back and watch<br/>\nher, stop evaluating her, and let her grow unimpeded.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, it&#39;s just all so exciting! :-D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering - has anyone read the book &#39;Borderliners&#39; by Peter Hoeg?<br/>\nIt&#39;s translated from Danish. It&#39;s fiction, but kind of autobiographical, and<br/>\nit, along with my own school and life experience of course, had a great deal<br/>\nof influence over my thinking on the subject. I was carrying it when I quit<br/>\nschool myself at fifteen, eleven years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I&#39;m very glad to be here and I look forward to talking with you all!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--cthiax<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9547,"nextTopicId":9524}}
