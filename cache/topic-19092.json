We&#39;re <br/>\nall concerned with living well together.   There&#39;s no denial of rights. <br/>\nThere&#39;s no enforcement of rights.   As parents and the big people with power <br/>\nwe deliberately talked about rights because we were parenting differently <br/>\nthan almost all other parents Dylan knew.   When Dylan wondered why some <br/>\nparents took away a kid&#39;s X box, we talked about the ideas that allow some <br/>\npeople to comfortably control and coerce others.   There was no <br/>\nestablishment of rights within our home as an establishment of rights within <br/>\na system of government.  The rights always were.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe in a family with lots of kid things are different but I&#39;m thinking <br/>\nback to the days when we&#39;d get our nieces and nephews for three months in <br/>\nthe summer.   We went from a house with one kid to a house with six kids. <br/>\nWe got along well because everyone knew their needs would be addressed. <br/>\nAgain, there was no need for enforcement of rights because there was no <br/>\ndenial of rights.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe some needs have priority.  The need to be safe is a higher <br/>\npriority than the need to smack something with a stick.  The kid who was the <br/>\nsomething being smacked needs to be helped to safety.   The kid who needs to <br/>\nsmack then, needs help to find something that&#39;s ok to smack.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think basic needs are a priority.  Food when someone&#39;s hungry.  Sleep when <br/>\nsomeone is tired, a potty when someone needs to go, safety when someone is <br/>\nbeing injured,  those needs take priority but that doesn&#39;t mean other needs <br/>\nget ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***None of these represent the &#39;working together&#39; paradigm of a common<br/>\ngoal of all the needs being addressed.***<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think our common goal of working together to meet the needs of all <br/>\nfamily members is what helps us understand children have the same rights as <br/>\nadults.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n***If dh were to state, &#39;I<br/>\nneed someplace to sit&#39;; and ds is sitting in the chair that dh ALWAYS<br/>\nsits in, there are many solutions to the dilemma which don&#39;t involve<br/>\nenforcing a sense of entitlement. Do you see how &quot;rights&quot; obstuct<br/>\naccessing the multitude of solutions?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we don&#39;t mean the same thing when were talking about rights.  My <br/>\nright so sit on my chair is a general right because I was born in a country <br/>\nwhere people have the right to own property.  Under my philosophy of <br/>\nunschooling though, I don&#39;t have more right to a chair in a home I share <br/>\nequally with other people.   Anyone in my house would move from one chair to <br/>\nanother if anyone else said, &quot;I wanted to sit there.&quot;   No struggle over <br/>\nrights would ensue because no one has more right to any particular chair <br/>\nthan anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kid has the same rights his dad and I have in our house.  He doesn&#39;t have <br/>\nthe same rights we have in society.  I compensate for that as much as <br/>\npossible when I can, out in the world.   At home though, he&#39;s not desperate <br/>\nto get the last piece of cake in order to enforce his right to have the same <br/>\nnumber of pieces of cake his dad or I had.    It doesn&#39;t happen.  He&#39;s not <br/>\nfighting for anything because he&#39;s not in any danger of losing anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that a person might have more need to sit in a particular chair - <br/>\nmy mom needs a higher chair and the chair with the lift to help her stand <br/>\nup - and because it is our goal to live well together we don&#39;t push Grammy <br/>\nout of the chair. &lt;g&gt;  (she&#39;s little, I could do it)<br/>\n<br/>\n***Do you see how &quot;rights&quot; obstuct<br/>\naccessing the multitude of solutions?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that could be possible in a case were the people involved were used <br/>\nto having to fight for what they needed or where they felt things were often <br/>\nunfair.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur experience has been that because we believe our kid has the same rights <br/>\nwe do we are more able to see solutions that honor everyone&#39;s needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n***know you are joking here, but this IS how conflicts escalate<br/>\nwithin a blame/fault paradigm from my experience.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I was joking.  Other people seldom find me as amusing as I find myself. <br/>\nI can live with that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI mostly see conflicts in other families escalate when the people involved <br/>\nbelieve they&#39;re at risk of not getting what they want, or haven&#39;t gotten <br/>\nwhat they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe throw blame and fault around pretty freely and part of that might be <br/>\nresidual childhood fear of punishment stuff.  But generally speaking humans <br/>\nuse the concepts of blame and fault to learn about their world and to <br/>\nunderstand natural consequences.    Radically unschooled kids might be less <br/>\nlikely to use blame and fault as a means to manipulate others or to comfort <br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Creating Solutions","postDate":"1164145010","msgId":19184,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVqdnJoaSt2ZWt2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVqdm9xbys5bmozQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19182,"nextInTopic":19189,"prevInTime":19183,"nextInTime":19185,"topicId":19092,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~!

We<br/>\ncan see this two ways. We can see the right to safety vs. the right to<br/>\nhurt someone. That&#39;s easy - we don&#39;t have a &quot;right&quot; to hurt someone<br/>\nelse (except in self defense or possibly in defense of others) But the<br/>\nsecond child probably doesn&#39;t think he has a &quot;right&quot; to hurt anyone.<br/>\nHe probably just wants to have his need for physical play met. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are probably other ways to meet the need for rough, physical<br/>\nplay for that child without infringing on the rights of others to be<br/>\nsafe. So, we can recognize and protect the right of the first child to<br/>\nbe safe and we can recognize and facilitate the right of the second<br/>\nchild to have his need for physical play met, in a safe way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe moment of intervention on behalf of a child being hurt will<br/>\nprobably not look like consensual living. The solution to the<br/>\nunderlying problem can, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat: <br/>\nI agree that addressing the underlying needs of both parties is the<br/>\ngoal. However, in my experience when we create a sense of entitlement<br/>\nof &quot;rights&quot;, then individuals vie for the &quot;more important&quot;, or<br/>\npriority &quot;right&quot;. The focus on &quot;rights&quot; creates an obstacle to sharing<br/>\na *common goal*. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe discussion becomes &quot;I have a right&quot; and &quot;he violated my rights&quot;.<br/>\nThere becomes an either/or quality to the interaction, rather than<br/>\nspending energy on &#39;my needs are xyz and your needs are abc, how can<br/>\nwe solve for both?&#39; Most conflicts do seem to escalate when one person<br/>\nisn&#39;t hearing another person&#39;s needs, and then the unheard person<br/>\n&#39;takes matters into his own hands&#39;, as it were. The construct of &#39;I<br/>\nhave a right to xyz&#39;, seems to encourage &#39;enforcing my right&#39;, often<br/>\nin a physical manner. Or, the parent may &#39;protect the child&#39;s rights&#39;.<br/>\nNone of these represent the &#39;working together&#39; paradigm of a common<br/>\ngoal of all the needs being addressed. It seems derailed at figuring<br/>\nout who is in the &quot;right&quot;, and who is in the &quot;wrong&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf instead, we state our needs/wants/desires (rather than our<br/>\nentitlement) for xyz, the other person doesn&#39;t need to *defend* his<br/>\n&quot;right&quot; to xyz. To me it just seems more steamline to discuss needs,<br/>\nrather than get in a debate about whose &quot;right&quot; is more important. For<br/>\ninstance, if ds is sitting in the chair that dh ALWAYS sits in, dh<br/>\ncould claim &quot;I have a right to sit in MY chair&quot;. Then ds is left to<br/>\nDEFEND, or GIVE UP, what he has. Or else...what? Dh must enforce his<br/>\n&quot;right&quot;, or give up his &quot;rights&quot; to the chair? If dh were to state, &#39;I<br/>\nneed someplace to sit&#39;; and ds is sitting in the chair that dh ALWAYS<br/>\nsits in, there are many solutions to the dilemma which don&#39;t involve<br/>\nenforcing a sense of entitlement. Do you see how &quot;rights&quot; obstuct<br/>\naccessing the multitude of solutions?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the event of one person hitting another, I have found it more<br/>\neffective to Facilitate Safety by removing the injured person; and<br/>\nmodel empathy for the feelings and needs of the injured person, while<br/>\nalso validating the feelings and needs of the angry person. In the<br/>\nheat of the moment, it is A LOT to do! But, it is easier, in my<br/>\nexperience to remove the injured party than to remove the angry party.<br/>\nAnd in my opinion, it is much easier to discuss underlying needs, than<br/>\nto debate &quot;rights&quot; in the heat of the angry moment! Even very young<br/>\nchildren can identify with core feelings and needs, as those are not<br/>\nin dispute. It is often an &quot;infrigement&quot; on perceived &quot;rights&quot; that<br/>\nprecipitates conflict, ime. But, we have the choice to focus on<br/>\n&quot;rights&quot;, or not, in our home. We choose to focus on feelings and<br/>\nneeds instead. <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t heard ds say, nor he heard us say, &#39;I have a right to abc&#39;.<br/>\nHe is very quick to articulate his needs, and we ours; and then we all<br/>\nare trouble shooting together to create a solution which encompasses<br/>\nall needs. He is amazingly adept at it because he trusts that his<br/>\nneeds will be addressed, and just suggests alternatives which also<br/>\naddress our needs. We do the same thing; and generally, it is very<br/>\nquick that we find a solution which is preferable to everyone. No one<br/>\nis spending time defending their needs or qualifying or justifying<br/>\ntheir needs as &quot;more important&quot;. It is so, so much easier to reach<br/>\nagreement when everyone is working toward the same goal: everyone&#39;s<br/>\nneeds are addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDanielle:<br/>\n*** I&#39;m in the midst of figuring out for myself some very difficult,<br/>\nnuancy philosophical issues.

It give us all a chance to figure out what is really<br/>\nimportant in the moment and how to eventually get what we want.......<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Creating Solutions","postDate":"1164041735","msgId":19100,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVqc21tNytnaDJrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGMzNS44NzNjMzdlLjMyOTMyMDI2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":19093,"nextInTopic":19101,"prevInTime":19099,"nextInTime":19101,"topicId":19092,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It does mean being committed to finding a solution that meets the underlying needs to everyone.

Meeting underlying needs is<br/>\ngreat, but you still aren&#39;t getting exactly what you want initially. I<br/>\nstill want a dog, but I don&#39;t have one. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy love for Markus is greater than my need for a greyhound. So<br/>\neverything in my life is exactly what I choose. But that involves<br/>\ncompromise of some things we&#39;d like. Dh would like our house to be<br/>\nspotless....he realizes that the other family members have different<br/>\nideas so he meets that need in some creative ways, none of which<br/>\ninvolve having our home be ultra-tidy or nattering at the other people<br/>\nliving here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can think of SO many day to day solutions we&#39;ve come up with that<br/>\nwork great, but involve a bit of &quot;giving up&quot;......again, not a<br/>\nnegative thing to us. I see giving to and for others something that is<br/>\nhealthy when done for the right reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think parents SHOULD give up some of their own needs in order<br/>\nto meet the needs of their child. That&#39;s part of being a parent. My<br/>\nvery real NEED for sleep is not as important as a babies need to<br/>\nnurse. I see it as giving my child what they need, my CHOICE and yet I<br/>\nignore my biological need for sleep to do that. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"Genant2@aol.com","from":"Genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Creating Solutions","postDate":"1164035622","msgId":19092,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMzNS44NzNjMzdlLjMyOTMyMDI2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19093,"prevInTime":19091,"nextInTime":19093,"topicId":19092,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/20/2006 12:56:51 A.M.
