When he watches TV, because he&#39;s also a visual learner, he&#39;s probably learning about the use of color to create a mood, how to manipulate cartoon facial expressions to communicate nonverbally (though I bet he also learned that from living with other humans!), how to use visual contrast, etc. I could not say 100% for sure what he was learning, and I don&#39;t have the need to. I just know: he&#39;s learning. He&#39;s 17 now, and he knows SO MUCH about so many different things - and he did at 5 and 8 and 12, too! His learning didn&#39;t look like school learning at all, natural learning does not look like school learning.

Give up the need to teach. *Live* with your kids, truly be *with* them. Take some deep breaths when you start thinking schooly thoughts, and don&#39;t let those turn into words or actions! And if they do, take more deep breaths and start again.

Unschooling isn&#39;t about schooling. It&#39;s about a basic belief and trust that part of being human is wanting to explore the world you live in. Learning is a byproduct of exploration. <br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian has written that when she doubted that unschooling was working she kept a journal of all that they did, all that they discussed over the course of a few weeks. And she was stunned. So much learning was going on, so much information was being discussed and derived and disseminated, that she just couldn&#39;t doubt the efficacy of unschooling. Maybe that would help you to see what all they are learning and doing in the things you are dismissing. The Suite Life of Zach and Cody is very interesting in its caricatures of people that it creates. In the novel ways that the two boys invariably get into trouble. The suggestible of one versus the conniving of the other. If you approach Zach and Cody with an understanding that there must be value in it if your children find it valuable than you might find things to fascinate you as well. Video games, I can&#39;t even begin, or end, thinking about how amazing video games are. Just yesterday Simon was playing<br/>\n with a step-cousin he&#39;s never met. The connection, the social lives, the story-telling, the level grinding, the focus, the reading, the math, the, the, the,....<br/>\n<br/>\nYou write &quot;it&#39;s hard to be patient...&quot; what are you waiting for? What do you think learning will look like if you wait long enough. They are learning right now, all the time, and they are exploring the world so intensely. Get in there, don&#39;t wait, do with them, be with them. And be proactive about describing what you are seeing so that your husband doesn&#39;t feel so afraid. Find the moments that can illustrate the days when he isn&#39;t home. Talk about the discussions you&#39;ve had, the ideas they&#39;ve brought up, the things you&#39;ve done. And write them all down. See the learning that is inherent in their lives.

My dad once told me that whenever he balances his checkbook he remembers learning his times table as a boy at school. I&#39;ve never used a times table when balancing a checkbook, and actually, I don&#39;t have a checkbook anymore. But it was a story he told because he didn&#39;t want Simon to struggle without the ability to add or subtract or multiply and divide because we weren&#39;t teaching him, through rote memorization, those skills. He even sent flashcards. I think I still have them. I loved putting them in order, you know 1x1=1, 1x2=2, 1x3=3, 1x4=4 because that was the epiphany for me, seeing that it was additive, that there was a pattern. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Simon was 4 or 5 he loved typing math problems out on my old typewriter. He&#39;d ask me for numbers and I&#39;d give them to him and he&#39;d write out 6 + 7 = 13. He hasn&#39;t done that for a long time now, but I bet I still have pages of those self-created math worksheets. Dad is afraid of math in his own life and he really believes that without a memorized to death understanding of the times tables he wouldn&#39;t be able to cope with the simplest of equations. But I had sat with Simon predicting his score while he played Asterix and Obelix on the computer where you could get multipliers for damage, so if you got 10 multipliers, every point of damage you did garnered you 10x the points. So what would normally only get you 5 points would get you 50 and Simon, at 5 or 6 was absolutely grasping that relationship without a moment of study. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard when you know that something has been lacking in your own life, or pivotally important, to not want to take the steps that you believe are necessary to make sure that your children fathom it. But, maybe, if you can talk to him about his fears, and not be defensive or angry, and totally listen you can work out something other than worksheets that make your son so unhappy to help to allay his fears. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband will NOT read anything on unschooling.

Like the period right before a growth spurt, I suppose, lots of intake but very little going out until suddenly, whoosh, a few inches taller. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you ever had the flu? And you feel like you are finally done, all better, no longer snuffling and sniffling and vomitting or whatever, but you are really emotionally sensitive? You cry over the stupidest ads on television, or a paragraph in a book that would never have made you tear up usually, and you find yourself swallowing back the tears? It&#39;s called post-flu malaise. I think post-school might be kind of like that. You&#39;ve suffered a series of intellectual insults and even though they&#39;ve stopped, the idea of doing anything that had been required of you for no reason, none of the gains that school sort of offered like good grades or being allowed to be on a football team or whatever, well it is so not appealling. And then one day, your mom offers to go the science museum and play with the electrical currents or see how high and hard you have to jump to get the seismograph to respond and that sounds cool. Not like it did a few weeks back. Or the<br/>\n thought of coming in to the kitchen and seeing what happens when you put food colouring in milk and then add a couple drops of dishwashing detergent doesn&#39;t make you think of some kind of horrible forced march, but instead you are curious, you want to see and more than that, you want to hold on to the cool colour swirls by capturing them on paper towels. That&#39;s when deschooling becomes unschooling. That point at which going and doing something which may have otherwise felt like school now feels like exploring the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that can help to make that happen is if you hang out with them and watch the shows they are watching. And talk about things if they are open to talking about things. Talk about why on earth it is that Zach&#39;s and Cody&#39;s mom is such a killjoy or why Raven&#39;s friends like her when she is so dismissive of their needs and perspectives or whatever else it is that strikes your fancy on a given day of watching television. Make good finger foods and bring drinks and hang out with them and see what it is that those shows are adding to their lives. Listen to them talk about the relationships between people, think about what they are obviously learning. And dance to Phineas and Ferb, I love Phineas and Ferb. And shout &quot;Aye Aye Captain&quot; with the Captain on Spongebob Squarepants. Make this period of relaxing back into a more normal life a time of you reaching out to meet them where they are instead of you waiting around for them to finally get over<br/>\n school and be ready to do the things that you think they ought to be doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe talk to your mom about deschooling. Living with someone who isn&#39;t that keen on what you are offering must be very difficult. Do the research, find pages on sandradodd.com or joyfullyrejoycing or within this list that you know will speak to her fears and concerns and print them out and offer them to her so she can see more of your perspective, your thinking. My dad has never agreed with what we do, but he has always believed that we researched it mightily and are totally commited to our children&#39;s wellbeing. Talk about what made you change your mind, remind her of the disconnect you saw your children having. It helps to always remember that she, too, is concerned about your children&#39;s wellbeing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: b prince &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:flyingtwinsmom@...\">flyingtwinsmom@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 20 April, 2010 0:52:58<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] i&#39;m having a hard time<br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;ve only been deschooling/unschooling since February.
