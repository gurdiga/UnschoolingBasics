I have done dressage, show jumpers,  hunters, trail, etc...  And <br/>\nI have fallen on just about every part of  my body and seen just about every <br/>\ntype of horse related accident there is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, yes, cleaning up is part of the deal but  it shouldn&#39;t be <br/>\ncalled a 60 min lesson if 30 minutes is cleaning.  Generally, beginning lessons <br/>\nshould cost about $25 for each 1/2 hour.  So if you ride for 60 minutes it should <br/>\nbe $50 and then you should BE  THERE for about 2 hours total, saddling and <br/>\nbrushing for 30 minutes  before, and cleaning and giving a bath to the horse (if <br/>\nit is FL  where I live and warm enough) for the last 30 minutes. If it is 30 <br/>\nminutes  of riding, you should be there for 1 hour and 3 minutes but you <br/>\nshould  only pay for the time you are in the saddle and there should be barn  <br/>\nassistants who teach and help the child with all the cleaning stuff while  the <br/>\nteacher moves on to other riding lessons.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs far as safety and the helmet is concerned; the helmet  should be on and <br/>\nstrapped the entire time the child is near or on the  horse. So when picking <br/>\nhooves the helmet is on, when brushing, when  riding. All the time. A kick in the <br/>\nhead can be fatal without the  helmet. A lot of people only use the helmet <br/>\nwhen ON the horse. That is  total nonsense. I learned this while working with a <br/>\nBritish instructor who  said that in England children are never seen around <br/>\nhorses without their  hard hats. Your stable should not have to provide one. <br/>\nSafety regulations  on them are always changing. If they have one and someone <br/>\nfell while  wearing it, the helmet is no longer usable. They need to be CURRENTLY <br/>\n certified and up to all the highest standards.<br/>\n <br/>\nPersonally, I would not DREAM of putting my child near a  horse without a <br/>\nhelmet in the $175-400 range. There are  certain brands that are better than <br/>\nothers if you want to  email me privately. Yes, you can buy a certified helmet <br/>\n(the  only kind that protects you) for $40 but it will not help your child as  <br/>\nmuch as one that goes lower down toward the neck which aids in preventing  <br/>\nparalysis and brain stem injuries. I also would always use long  sleeve t-shirts, <br/>\nleather schooling chaps over breeches or jeans and boots  with a heal. All the <br/>\nthings I just mentioned can be found on eBay  sometimes for as little as a <br/>\nDOLLAR each! The helmet MUST be new.  Otherwise it could have been in an accident <br/>\nand of no use. <br/>\n <br/>\nAdriana<br/>\n <br/>\nPS my kids are not allowed to pick out hooves without my  help. I don&#39;t think <br/>\nit is safe.<br/>\n <br/>\nPPS a great way to teach horse safety to your  child is to study Parelli <br/>\nNatural Horsemanship. BTW Pat Parelli  homeschooled  his children. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;**************************************&lt;BR&gt; Check out free AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://free.aol.com/thenewaol/index.adp.\">http://free.aol.com/thenewaol/index.adp.</a>  Most comprehensive set of free <br/>\nsafety and security tools, millions of free high-quality videos from across the <br/>\nweb, free AOL Mail and much more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":285800846,"authorName":"SquishyMommyof2@aol.com","from":"SquishyMommyof2@...","profile":"steveshotwife2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] horseback riding...","postDate":"1172082964","msgId":21568,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMyYy5hZDRkZDNlLjMzMGRlYjE0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":21567,"nextInTopic":21571,"prevInTime":21567,"nextInTime":21569,"topicId":21556,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have been riding since i was 6 and competativly riding in A  class grand prixs (the stuff you see on ESPN) since i was 13.

I have  always riden at show <br/>\nbarns, so picking up after your horse (poop, brushing,  bath, blanket, put <br/>\naway) isnt an option. You either do it or you dont ride  there.  The frog is the <br/>\nsensitive part in the hoof, but really it&#39;s pretty  hard to damage it unless <br/>\nyou are stabbing the hoof cleaner into the frog.   Otherwise it is pretty <br/>\ndifficult to hurt the hoof if you are doing it  correctly.  The hoof of a horse is <br/>\njust like out nails.  They are made  in essence out of the same stuff and have <br/>\nno nerve endings.  Which is why  shoeing a horse doesn&#39;t bother them.  In <br/>\nregards to a helmet, i would  be very carfeful if you buy a used one.  There are <br/>\nreally 2 different types  of helmets.  Certified and uncertified.  If your <br/>\ndaughter might show,  she CANNOT wear uncertified helm&#39;s till she is 18 and it <br/>\nhas to have a chin  strap.   In the horse world we call them bubble helmets <br/>\nbecause they  are huge and look like a bubble.   <br/>\n <br/>\nIn a message dated 2/21/2007 9:16:57 A.M.
