It&#39;s clear that you did not<br/>\nread the guidelines before you joined this list. It can be frustrating<br/>\ngetting into these long threads about an individuals right to unbridled<br/>\nself-expression. Lists have guidelines for a reason. People come here for<br/>\nhelp and guidance from the UNSCHOOLING point of view. In that sense, all are<br/>\nwelcome, whatever your religious affiliation or lack thereof. This list has<br/>\nguidelines in order to keep it focused, productive, and growth-oriented,<br/>\nIMO. That is my experience of it. When people go off in this unbridled way,<br/>\nit takes time, effort, and energy to try and help the unbridled one see the<br/>\nreal purpose of this list and how it might actually benefit them to stay<br/>\nwithin list guidelines. When it becomes clear that a person will continue to<br/>\ninsist on their &quot;right&quot; to speak as they wish, taking up people&#39;s precious<br/>\ntime and resources, then, personally, as an extremely appreciative member of<br/>\nthis list, I have no problem seeing that person blocked from posting. If I<br/>\nwant to find God, a god, goddesses, or anything else under the sun, I&#39;m<br/>\npretty sure there&#39;s a list out there somewhere for just that thing.
