It&#39;s really not <br/>\nnecessary though, because school&#39;s structure must be scaled to handle <br/>\n20 to 30 kids in a classroom.  You know how much a child can learn <br/>\nwith an individual tutor, right?  So, our learning is understandably <br/>\nnot structured after a classroom environment.  The learning happens in <br/>\nmany bits and pieces throughout the day.  I find that just being with <br/>\nthe children and just talking lots about what&#39;s on everybody&#39;s mind is <br/>\nwhere the real value and joy is found.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nInvariably, I get a knowing nod from the person I&#39;m with.  From the <br/>\nresponses I get from most people, I believe that they feel that they <br/>\nhave a better understanding of how learning can happen outside of <br/>\nschool without the burden of setting up a miniature classroom (I <br/>\nrealize that this is a drop in the bucket to understanding what we do, <br/>\nbut hey, you got to start somewheres).  I also hope to leave them with <br/>\na nugget of hope that they too, could homeschool their children. I <br/>\nthink when I include the word joy in there, this kind of throws folks <br/>\na bit.  I&#39;d venture that they are thinking, &quot;Learning is work.  Where <br/>\nis this joy thing coming from?&quot; But, I also think that this is <br/>\nsomewhat compelling to them.  Sometimes they will enquire more about <br/>\nwhat we do if they get enough warm fuzzies and don&#39;t feel threatened.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wording in my response is always somewhat different, of course.  I <br/>\nam now trying to be careful not to use the word teach and rephrase <br/>\nthings to utilize the word learner as much as possible.  I&#39;m hoping, <br/>\nby using unschoolish wording without calling out unschooling directly, <br/>\nthat the person can experience the shift in thinking while not feeling <br/>\nalienated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny response is colored by the other person&#39;s openness though.  <br/>\nSometimes, I just change the subject.  I admit, other times I am not <br/>\nin a good enough mood to be patient and am more direct or even <br/>\nimpish.  When I am patient though, it is interesting seeing a glimmer <br/>\nof understanding in people&#39;s eyes, especially when I take the time to <br/>\nbuild a bridge from their view of the world to an unschooling world.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":213809267,"authorName":"jlh44music","from":"&quot;jlh44music&quot; &lt;jlh44music@...&gt;","profile":"jlh44music","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Answering Questions from non-unschoolers","postDate":"1149917430","msgId":14300,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU2ZGxkbStkMnAzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ0OEE0M0JDLjIwNDAwQGFkZWxwaGlhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":14298,"nextInTopic":14301,"prevInTime":14299,"nextInTime":14301,"topicId":14240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... dance for you and I and our one year of freedom!

When the kids and I were out, someone asked them if <br/>\nthey were excited about summer vacation.  And they just sort of stood <br/>\nthere kicking the dirt and finally my oldest says &quot;We homeschool&quot;.  So <br/>\nthen the lady turns to me and asks if we&#39;re &quot;taking a break&quot; for summer <br/>\nand admitted that she wouldn&#39;t be able to teach her kids anything <br/>\nbecause she would go nuts.  So then I am standing there with my mouth <br/>\nhanging open too and kicking the dirt trying to find a way to say &quot;We <br/>\nlearn all the time and love it!&quot; but for some reason it wouldn&#39;t come <br/>\nout of my mouth.  I think I ended up saying something to the effect that <br/>\n&quot;no, we don&#39;t take a break&quot; and that I consider myself a facilitator, <br/>\nnot a teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the third time this has happened to me in the past 2 weeks and I <br/>\nthink I need to rehearse some joyfully delivered answers.  Certainly the <br/>\nfoot in my mouth is not cutting it! There are lots of school-at-homers <br/>\nin my neck of the woods, so most of the people who have asked me about <br/>\nit are not negative about homeschooling itself per se.  But they do <br/>\nassume we do school work at home and stay on a school schedule, etc.  <br/>\nSome of these people homeschool themselves and others don&#39;t.  I feel <br/>\nlike I should at least plant a seed in their mind but I never know where <br/>\nto begin.  The questions come from a worldview that is so total alien to <br/>\nour reality that I don&#39;t even know how to begin to answer.  And I guess <br/>\nI am afraid of saying too much and freaking them out.  I&#39;ve noticed that <br/>\nI never ever say the word &quot;unschool&quot; in front of anyone except other <br/>\nunschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?  Or advice for a newbie?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Alice<br/>\n(who is joyfully celebrating her family&#39;s one year anniversary of <br/>\nfreedom from school- Yeehaw!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14297,"nextTopicId":14229}}
