Chocolate fountains are very &quot;in&quot; now and<br/>\nrenting one is pricey. You might try using a little<br/>\npump like the ones used for table size fountains. Just<br/>\nsoak it in some bleachy water (rinse and dry <br/>\nwell)before trying the chocolate. Make sure the<br/>\nchocolate is very well melted before putting the pump<br/>\nin. Chocolate does not have to be very hot to flow but<br/>\ncheck for lumps. Chocolate and water don&#39;t mix. While<br/>\nthe recommendation to melt is in a double boiler, my<br/>\nstove on low is actually low enough to melt straight<br/>\non the burner.
