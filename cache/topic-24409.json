And  reassure them that they are not giving up or failing!<br/>\nWell, sort of. Grace was in conventional hs this past year at her dad&#39;s  <br/>\nhouse, and is taking a summer school class because she failed math. James has  <br/>\nbeen doing, sorta, lol, an online high school called Global Village, which *I*  <br/>\nlove (but it&#39;s costing me too much right now, even though they are a good price <br/>\n I feel) due to it&#39;s unschooly feel and open program, but HE doesn&#39;t feel <br/>\nnormal.  He just wants to be &quot;normal.&quot; (his word, not mine) and he is also taking <br/>\na  summer school class. Maybe they&#39;ll both hate it wildly and decide to stay <br/>\nhome  next year... ;) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they go to school, continue to do fun things with them even  during<br/>\nschool hours - like say, pick them up early and head to the  beach<br/>\ntogether or whatever.  And YOU can stop worrying about  grades,<br/>\nhomework, attendance etc.  <br/>\nNever did. Was accused of being uncaring and not involved and even of being  <br/>\na bad parent - by them AND other family members (on their dad&#39;s side). But <br/>\nyes,  the fun things - yes, yes! Good point to add them into it all. Sometimes I <br/>\ncan&#39;t  see the forest for the trees, lol...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother  option, if they don&#39;t want to give<br/>\nup school entirely, is to just take the  classes of their choosing and<br/>\nleave the rest.  I know several  homeschooled kids that do this.<br/>\nI like that too, though I can only imagine the fun conversations with the  <br/>\nlocal high school...(I went there, I think I am holding a grudge, lol)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever they choose next year, you can continue to live  your life and<br/>\nlead your family in an unschooling direction.  Read  Grace Llewellyn&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;Guerrilla Learning&quot; so that if they do choose school,  you can take it<br/>\nnot so seriously.  Focus on having great relationships  with them and<br/>\nlistening to them.  Like someone else said, they will  choose whatever<br/>\nthey feel is better choice for them, so if they are still  choosing<br/>\nschool, you may have to do some deep thinking and talking to  them<br/>\nabout why.  <br/>\nYes, and I will get that book, too. I love her writing and her expression  of <br/>\nher ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy own  teen was very reluctant to leave school because he<br/>\nthought homeschoolers  were losers and he didn&#39;t want to be a loser.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT is it! YES!!! That is IT, 100%. They both are stuck in that horribly  <br/>\nwrong impression. So much so, that I couldn&#39;t get them to attend a conference or <br/>\n any outings or anything...unless I bribed them, lol...which I might do! But <br/>\nyes,  that is indeed the crux of the matter. And since it&#39;s totally untrue, <br/>\nbut hard  to show them...how do I show them that? And what does your son think <br/>\nnow? How  old is he? Does he live near me, lol..? Might he be willing to share <br/>\nwith me his  change in perspective? <br/>\n <br/>\nGee, thanks so much for that. It may sound silly, but even though they said  <br/>\nthose very words, I couldn&#39;t keep them in my head when discussing this with <br/>\nall  of you. <br/>\n <br/>\nThis is REALLY helping all.

But school is manipulative, so you can decide what you   <br/>\nthink...<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, you can&#39;t make them want something. You MIGHT be able  to make them  <br/>\ndo <br/>\nit (and at 17 and 15, that seems unlikely) but you  can&#39;t make them like it.  <br/>\nAnd at 17, if he&#39;s been traditionally  schooled all along and NOT hated it, <br/>\nyour  son may figure he may as  well finish up. But you can let him know he <br/>\nhas a  <br/>\nchoice, which is  cool.  Your daughter, a bit younger, seems a more likely   <br/>\nprospect.<br/>\nThat&#39;s the odd thing - he did HATE it. I mean HATE it...we have tried  <br/>\nvarious things this past school year and he is sooooo hesitant and untrusting of  <br/>\nunschooling. Too &quot;hippie&quot; for him, as am I a lot of the time ;) Grace loves the  <br/>\nsocial stuff from school - I see my &quot;job&quot; as showing them that social  <br/>\ninteraction doesn&#39;t really only come from school..in fact, Grace&#39;s best friend  she <br/>\nmet because they lived in the same neighborhood, not because they went to  the <br/>\nsame school, lol...go figure! ;) James has a VERY nice social life - busy  <br/>\nevery day with friends, despite not going to conventional school all this year.  <br/>\nHe has been at Global Village School - an online, wonderfully supportive <br/>\nschool.  But he hasn&#39;t liked it - he doesn&#39;t consider any of what he has been <br/>\ndoing  &quot;normal&quot; and he really just wants to fit in. I hope to help him see that he <br/>\ncan  and does fit in with a variety of types of people, in a variety of <br/>\nsettings. I  don&#39;t think either see their beautiful strengths and qualities that <br/>\nwell yet. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my second idea. Bribe &#39;em. Is there something either or  both would LOVE  <br/>\nto do, but school gets in the way? Or something they  want? Tell them you&#39;ll <br/>\nmake  it happen if they&#39;ll give unschooling  six month&#39;s chance. Take them on <br/>\nan  <br/>\namazing trip or buy them kayaks,  or whatever. Be clear that you KNOW you&#39;re  <br/>\nbribing them, and why,  and if they say no, accept gracefully and let them <br/>\nknow <br/>\nyou want to  support them in ALL their decisions. If they agree, and six <br/>\nmonths   later, want to go back to school, say thanks, and support  them.<br/>\nI actually like that idea, because they are thinking so conventionally,  <br/>\nperhaps a conventional way to get this moving isn&#39;t a bad idea. I can&#39;t bribe  <br/>\nthem with too much stuff however - I do mean &quot;stuff&quot; like tangible objects, or  <br/>\nhigh monetary value items - we are pretty much living to the penny as it is. <br/>\nBut  I will think on this...a trial sounds good...I also suggested to Grace that <br/>\nif  she is unable to do well enough in conventional high school here with me, <br/>\nthat  I&#39;d really like the option to do homeschooling with her - not as a <br/>\npunishment,  but as a way to help her get out of high school and move forward. She <br/>\nknows that  *I* care little about grades - that I care about her spirit and <br/>\nsense of self  first and above all else. We are becoming good friends :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is wonderful, but an even better gift is letting  them know that  <br/>\nthey have your support even if they make choices  different than yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\nYup, I agree. Thanks, Kathryn. I appreciate the help and advice! <br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7644358,"authorName":"Kidgie@aol.com","from":"Kidgie@...","profile":"mama_de_julian_y_julia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] again with the teen thing :)","postDate":"1181844410","msgId":24465,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJmMy4xMWJhODA2OC4zM2EyZGRiYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24454,"nextInTopic":24468,"prevInTime":24464,"nextInTime":24466,"topicId":24409,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/12/2007 11:26:59 A.M.

I want them out of school and unschooling, they  both want the <br/>\ntraditional/traditional/&lt;WBR&gt;conventional ways. Besides leaving The  Teenager<br/>\nLlewellyn around and available, what else can I do?  Should do? Thoughts on <br/>\nthis? &lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nTwo responses come to mind, and the second might strike people as  <br/>\nmanipulative. But school is manipulative, so you can decide what you  think...<br/>\n <br/>\nFirst, you can&#39;t make them want something. You MIGHT be able to make them  do <br/>\nit (and at 17 and 15, that seems unlikely) but you can&#39;t make them like it.  <br/>\nAnd at 17, if he&#39;s been traditionally schooled all along and NOT hated it, <br/>\nyour  son may figure he may as well finish up. But you can let him know he has a  <br/>\nchoice, which is cool.  Your daughter, a bit younger, seems a more likely  <br/>\nprospect.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, my second idea. Bribe &#39;em. Is there something either or both would LOVE  <br/>\nto do, but school gets in the way? Or something they want? Tell them you&#39;ll <br/>\nmake  it happen if they&#39;ll give unschooling six month&#39;s chance. Take them on an  <br/>\namazing trip or buy them kayaks, or whatever. Be clear that you KNOW you&#39;re  <br/>\nbribing them, and why, and if they say no, accept gracefully and let them know <br/>\n you want to support them in ALL their decisions. If they agree, and six <br/>\nmonths  later, want to go back to school, say thanks, and support them.<br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooling is wonderful, but an even better gift is letting them know that  <br/>\nthey have your support even if they make choices different than yours.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] again with the teen thing :)","postDate":"1181672552","msgId":24412,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOTdCMzVDNzREMjMwOC1CODQtMzhEN0BtYmxrLWQxMC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGQzMy5lYzFkZjJmLjMzYTAzNTQ4QGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGQzMy5lYzFkZjJmLjMzYTAzNTQ4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":24410,"nextInTopic":24436,"prevInTime":24411,"nextInTime":24413,"topicId":24409,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
