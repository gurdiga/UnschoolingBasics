I don&#39;t let it show to  him,<br/>\nbut it&#39;s really wearing on me. I love his hugs and holding his  hand.<br/>\nBut the &quot;having an extra body attached to me&quot; is wearing on  me...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOH! I miss that time so much!!!! But I remember feeling  a little like you <br/>\nare describing when things were &#39;crazy clingy&#39; and then  feeling guilty! One <br/>\nthing that worked so well for all three of mine was  *getting them* before they <br/>\nget me :-) so for example, if they were calmly  playing on the carpet with <br/>\nlegos at my feet while I was at the computer my  thoughts were &quot;oh good I can have <br/>\na second to myself&quot; but my actions were  to get on the floor for a few <br/>\nminutes and kiss, hug, hold cuddle and be  the instigator of all the mushiness. It <br/>\n&quot;filled them up&quot; with what they  needed and helped them be less clingy. It also <br/>\nhelped for me to  assume that EVERYONE was sleeping with me every single <br/>\nnight, then if they  didn&#39;t want to, they would go out to their own beds on their <br/>\nown. My  7 year old daughter still sleeps in my bed 90% of the time but she is <br/>\n always welcome there and encouraged. My boys LAUGH if I ask them if they  <br/>\nwant to sleep there (they are 9 and 11) and are totally independent now,  but <br/>\nthat wasn&#39;t always the case. If something sad happens (like when our  dog died) <br/>\nor if someone feels sick, they always end up with me. It is a  really nice way <br/>\nfor them to get comfort and security. I&#39;m so glad they  still feel like it is <br/>\ntotally ok to do so! Hang in there - it does  get better and then you will <br/>\nwant it all back again!<br/>\n <br/>\nAdriana   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19469,"nextTopicId":19579}}
