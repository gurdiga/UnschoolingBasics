I remind him that if he doesn&#39;t want to contribute to the <br/>\npeace and happiness of the other people in the room, that he should <br/>\nfind another place in the house to be.<br/>\nI can be quite forceful if someone is bent on hurting another human <br/>\nbeing in any way. :)<br/>\nI don&#39;t punish him, I DO try to maintain the comfort level of the <br/>\nother people that don&#39;t deserve his actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAllowing one child to make another child miserable, is ignoring our <br/>\nduties in my opinion. <br/>\n<br/>\nI try to get to the root of the problem, asking him if he needs some <br/>\none on one time, or to get out of the house, or some food...or <br/>\nwhatever. I think by dialoguing these things it will help him <br/>\neventually notice this behavior rising up and he&#39;ll have ways to <br/>\ndeal with it before it becomes a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemoving a problem person from the vicinity is how I&#39;d deal with <br/>\nanyone that was verbally or physically trying to harm anyone else in <br/>\nmy family. Heck, sometimes *I* am the one that needs removing, and <br/>\nmy dh steps in and reminds me to get away from everyone before doing <br/>\nsomething stupid. I have a temper, and I&#39;m not safe around anyone <br/>\nwhen I&#39;m really pissed....so it&#39;s good to have family reminding each <br/>\nother when it&#39;s time to take a break. Isolating oneself can be <br/>\nreally helpful...sometimes our children need a reminder that they <br/>\naren&#39;t safe around other people at that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1781,"nextTopicId":1590}}
