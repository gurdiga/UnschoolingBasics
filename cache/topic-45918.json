However, I think I&#39;ll jump in here. I can&#39;t really speak to how to handle your situation as far as unschooling goes, but I can answer some of the braille questions. I happen to be the legally, almost totally, blind mother of a sighted daughter. I&#39;d be happy to chat with you either on or off list about some ideas for working on the tactile part of braille fun. I&#39;d also be more than willing to talk with your daughter if she&#39;d like. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know exactly where in the process you are, but one thing that can be kind of fun is to use a peg board to create the braille letters. I think we used golf tees when I was little. Also, you can use different materials to make bigger dots to start with. My grandmother used to write me messages in puff paint. Even things like outlining a coloring page in glue so that it has a raised line and she can feel rather than see where to color can help with tactile recognition. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that gives you a starting point.

We have unschooled from the beginning but until about 2 years ago didn&#39;t really know it had a name. I&#39;m comfortable in our unschooling approach except in one area that a flounder around in.  My daughter is 7 and is legally blind. She has enough vision to see extremely large print but we assume braille will be her primary reading means.  She has expressed an interest in learning to read because her 5 year old brother is a fluent reader and she sees how it allows him to be more independent in playing on the wii and the computer. We discussed with her the avenues she has to learning to read, both print and braille. She would like to learn both. She is struggling to pick up reading print but I&#39;m not concerned about it. I know that 7 is still very young and she has some other issues (learning differences and speech issues) that may make reading print more challenging. Braille she has picked up on very quickly and is making great progress with. But she struggling with tactile discrimination, which is needed to actually read a braille cell.  The problem is that recently her interest in putting the time and energy towards learning Braille has diminished. Part of me is fine with this. The other part struggles with letting it go. Braille is not one of those things she is just going to stumble onto learning. Though we have lots of braille books and braille labels on household stuff, I don&#39;t believe it is enough for her to become even functionally literate by mere exposure, like one can do with print.  Typically she will ask what we can do on any given day and I always just threw in that we could look at learning some more braille and typically she&#39;d be interested. But about 2 months ago, the interest started to decline and I started gently pushing her to do it.  Adding it before or after something that she really wanted to do.  This isn&#39;t sitting right with me. I don&#39;t want to be pushing it but I have concerns over the &quot;what if she never wants to learn it&quot;.  She listens to audio stories all day and has a screen reader for the computer. I can easily slip into the mindset that she will never be &quot;motivated&quot; to do it learn it on her own.  But in this age of technology, is being literate in a format that is not easily accessible (Braille) even important?  I&#39;m just struggling to figure out how to fit braille into unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMichele</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45924,"nextTopicId":45956}}
