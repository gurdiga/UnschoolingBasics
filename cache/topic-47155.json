I&#39;ve tutored high school students in the past, it doesn&#39;t matter if he&#39;s &quot;at grade level&quot; in anything at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re caught between a rock and a hard place by not being a parent or guardian - you&#39;re the tutor, at best, and regardless of anyone&#39;s feelings on the matter that cuts you out of a good deal. I&#39;m a stepmom, so I can relate and empathize. It helps Me to see myself as a consultant to my stepson, but not his biological mother. I don&#39;t have any &quot;authority&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way, that&#39;s how unschooling works even with our &quot;own&quot; kids - we&#39;re their consultants, not their managers. When the child isn&#39;t &quot;ours&quot; we get to see just how tenuous a matter it is to be a consultant to a minor. They have few powers under law. As unschooling parents, we choose to uphold their decisions and support them, but the power is really still ours. It&#39;s something to keep in mind when thinking about things like &quot;rights&quot; - the rights of children are largely determined by their parents, for better or worse.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I could consider him graduated, but his mother isn&#39;t wanting to do that just yet (partly because he will loose his SSI if he isn&#39;t enrolled full time in school).

You could read the Teenage Liberation Handbook and suggest your nephew read it too. You can help Him negotiate with the school to some extent - give him ideas of what to say and ask and encourage him to take charge of his own &quot;education&quot;. You can talk about adapting to circumstances as a survival trait the way prisoners are counselled (when they receive any counselling) about adapting to incarceration. You can help him look into early emancipation. But none of those things are unschooling, they&#39;re about helping him bend to or work the system. You have few real choices to offer him at this time Because he&#39;s a minor and you&#39;re not a guardian.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I also think my nephew would like to see that someone does see the value of what he does and that it does translate to real learning.

If it really came down to that, your 17-year-old would be put in 11th grade (I would think) and then be tested and followed to see what adjustments need to be done along the way. At that grade level, there are different levels of reading/math/etc. classes and adjustments could be made.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, we also have the community/state college system. Again, it will be different for your state. Here, though, you stay enrolled wherever you are (umbrella school or county registration) and go to the community college for FREE* classes. There is a CPT (placement test) to see if you can handle college-level reading and math and placement is based on that. If you pass the English part but not the math, for instance, you can take certain classes that don&#39;t require math while you take remedial classes in math (or not). (Not sure the remedial classes are free. And the * by FREE means that textbooks and other supplies are not covered.) Still you have junior and senior year students who are homeschoolers and getting college credit (up to an AA&#39;s worth) at the local community college.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there is the online option -- FLVS.net -- also available in some other states. This is for high school credits only but does result in a transcript that might shut relatives up. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there is a page for the state&#39;s scholarship program -- Bright Futures -- this is the page that helps you find the right course name and code to put together a transcript -- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.osfaffelp.org/bfiehs/fnbpcm02_CCTMain.aspx\">https://www.osfaffelp.org/bfiehs/fnbpcm02_CCTMain.aspx</a>  Maybe your state has a similar thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not suggesting any of these options would be a fit for your son but staying enrolled while you figure out if there is anything out there you want to use is a good idea. Students can &quot;graduate&quot; when they are 16 here but it isn&#39;t necessarily a good idea because you lose access to all these choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Shannan Frohlich&quot; &lt;momfrohlich73@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I could consider him graduated, but his mother isn&#39;t wanting to do that just yet (partly because he will loose his SSI if he isn&#39;t enrolled full time in school).

In many states, a parent/guardian can simply fill out a form to say &quot;my child has graduated&quot; kind of thing - it&#39;s not dropping out but simply graduating early. Then he might, if he chooses, start with community college or vocational training classes or even (gasp) get a job even if it&#39;s the lowest entry beginner type job in an area that he&#39;s interested in exploring.
