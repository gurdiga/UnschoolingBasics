(Sometimes I&#39;ll ask, &quot;Is there anything I can do?&quot; but I usually <br/>\ndon&#39;t, and I usually don&#39;t get a positive response at those <br/>\ntimes.)  I have asked him during calm times what he would like me to <br/>\ndo (help or not) and he says it&#39;s different every time.  Even though <br/>\nI got no clarity into the situation from our calm-time talk, he did <br/>\nget the strong message that I care and I&#39;m here and I love him and I <br/>\nwant to help if I can.  I think it helps him just to know that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that he gets over his frustration unbelievably quickly <br/>\nif I just stay out of it.  So, I bite my lip and do just that!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, someone (ugh - I can&#39;t remember who, was it Mary?  I can&#39;t <br/>\nremember) said that she envisions herself as a &quot;mountain of <br/>\ncalm.&quot;  So, I don&#39;t do or say anything, and if I&#39;m told to go away I <br/>\ndo it, but I do keep a visual in my head of being a mountain of calm <br/>\nand calming energy.  Whether it helps him or not, I don&#39;t know; but <br/>\nit helps me not get in there and make things worse, and I guess that <br/>\nhelps in some way.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as Heather mentioned, I try to be a good frustration model for <br/>\nhim.  I realize that because he and I spend so much concentrated time <br/>\ntogether, he gets a ton of his cues from me, so I *try* to make sure <br/>\nI&#39;m modeling frustration for him in an honest, healthy way.  And, <br/>\nhe&#39;s really supportive of me when I&#39;m having a frustrating time of it <br/>\n(which happens from time to time when you do the work I do!).  It&#39;s <br/>\nwild to hear him mirroring back the supportive things I have said to <br/>\nhim around feeling frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that&#39;s helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marji<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  It also helps me to remember that I used to be just like him <br/>\nwhen I was a kid, and I know that whatever the thing was that I <br/>\ntrying to do that was getting me angry and frustrated was my row to <br/>\nhoe, as it were.  I really would have preferred the privacy to deal <br/>\nwith my demons without an audience.   As I listen to Liam rant in a <br/>\nloud whisper in the other room at his video game, I vividly remember <br/>\nthe double-whammy of being pissed at myself *and* feeling responsible <br/>\nfor my mother&#39;s anxiety as she witnessed my struggles.

He didn&#39;t want to give up, nor did he need my permission, he wanted to keep trying and any words from me were received as unsolicited advice.  He knew I didn&#39;t have any useful tips to offer so my efforts to help made him angry with me - I was keeping him from working it his way.  And not because I could really help him, but because I was uncomfortable with his struggle -- I felt a need to &#39;fix&#39; it for him.  He saw all this before I did, of course.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Finally, once I saw what was going on between us -- the dynamic I was creating -- I learned to just quietly watch and wait. It&#39;s his style to become frustrated, and the outbursts are a release for him that lets him continue working at something. I offered food and drinks, and when he wanted to celebrate successes, I was happy for him, asking questions about the game and the details of what had been required to move ahead.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Progress was slow, and gradually he found less angry-feeling ways (for me) to get thru the process.  And I spent a lot of time breathing, and waiting, and quietly knowing that he&#39;d work thru this all and come out on the other side.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Gary (dh)<br/>\n  Will (22) Andy (10-1/2) and Dan (6) <br/>\n   <br/>\n      A knowledge of the path cannot be substituted for putting one foot in front of the other. ~M.C.
