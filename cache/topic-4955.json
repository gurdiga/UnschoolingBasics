My son<br/>\nTyler is almost 13, and this is our first year homeschooling. We&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen enjoying the absolute freedom of deschooling, and learning how to<br/>\nbe together on a daily basis again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning he came to me and said that he&#39;s feeling concerned that<br/>\nhe&#39;s not doing enough for homeschooling and that he might need to go<br/>\nback to school. Truthfully we haven&#39;t been &quot;doing&quot; much in schoolish<br/>\nterms, which I explained to him. We&#39;ve been in a healing phase, and<br/>\nworking on letting go of thinking in school&#39;s terms. I asked what he<br/>\nfeels like he&#39;s missing, and he couldn&#39;t really articulate it, just<br/>\nthat he feels like he&#39;s not doing what he &quot;should&quot; be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about the things that made him and all of us so unhappy<br/>\nabout school, and that going back he&#39;d need to realize that those<br/>\nthings would still be present, that he wouldn&#39;t have the power to<br/>\nchange school, only his own reactions to school. Learning/living at<br/>\nhome and in the world, he has the power to change many things. He can<br/>\nstart something new. He can stop something that isn&#39;t fulfilling. He<br/>\ncan try different things that he might not have the time or energy to<br/>\ndo if he had to spend so much time in the classrooms and doing<br/>\nhomework again.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe seemed to understand what I said, but he&#39;s definitely getting to<br/>\nthe yearning phase. I want to help, but know from experience that any<br/>\nsuggestions I make are generally met with a negative response. We&#39;ve<br/>\nsigned up to get together with some other unschooling kids for 10<br/>\nweeks in April and May to do some round table civics type discussions,<br/>\nand to talk about creative ways math is a part of our lives. He&#39;s also<br/>\ndoing karate, but without much joy anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m encouraging him to make a list (with me) of things he&#39;s interested<br/>\nin, and the different ways we could go about getting involved, and I&#39;m<br/>\nputting my own desires on the list as well. Other than that, I&#39;m<br/>\nfeeling a bit at a loss. Maybe it&#39;s just the winter blahs that&#39;s<br/>\nmaking me feel stuck. Spring will hold all kinds of promise for new<br/>\ngrowth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m looking for some encouragement to keep on keeping on, and<br/>\nmaybe if anyone has any suggestions for how to help him without<br/>\npushing. My strewing so far isn&#39;t making any connections.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much,<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4654,"nextTopicId":4987}}
