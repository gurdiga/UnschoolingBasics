Then find places where that can have a <br/>\nwriting component. For example, writing a game review for Amazon or <br/>\nwriting an article and submitting it for publication on neopets <br/>\n(apparently it&#39;s a pretty tough thing to get published there because <br/>\nthere are so many writing so don&#39;t worry about whether it actually <br/>\nis published). Maybe suggest the two of you learn to blog rather <br/>\nthan a paper and pencil journal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, while this is happening, check the LAWS of the state. If you <br/>\nsubmit a one paragraph game review is that enough? is the reviewer <br/>\noverstepping the bounds of the requirements? can you change <br/>\nreviewers? Checking with others in your area might be more helpful <br/>\nalso - or see if there is a yahoo group for MD unschoolers (there <br/>\nprobably is). Also, it might be worthwhile to check with an umbrella <br/>\nlike Clonlara - at a quick glance it looks like if you&#39;ve got any <br/>\nkind of &#39;correspondence program&#39; going on, the district simply <br/>\nsays &#39;is this student following your rules?&quot; they say Yes and life <br/>\ngoes on...and Clonlara is fine with unschooling from what I <br/>\nunderstand (others can correct me if I&#39;m off base on this).<br/>\n<br/>\nI might simply sit down and discuss it - &quot;In order to keep living <br/>\nour life the way we want to, we need to give &quot;them&quot; some paperwork. <br/>\nThis is what they want to see (written essay). How can we give them <br/>\nthat without being too big an interruption in the rest of our life?&quot; <br/>\nHe might be willing to simply sit down and write a quick report in <br/>\norder to get it out of the way and done.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":142386995,"authorName":"amy_voltz","from":"&quot;amy_voltz&quot; &lt;cocobien@...&gt;","profile":"amy_voltz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"unschooling and &quot;writing&quot;","postDate":"1136479462","msgId":8745,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRwamlkNitsdnQyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8749,"prevInTime":8744,"nextInTime":8746,"topicId":8745,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Another new unschooler here, I ve been trying this with my 9 yo son since leaving the PS system last March.

Just had our first review with <br/>\nthe school system (we are in MD) where the requirements say you must <br/>\nshow &quot;clear evidence of instruction&quot; in Language Arts, Mathematics, <br/>\nScience, Social Studies, Art/Music, PE and Health. Our reviewer wants <br/>\nto see more &quot;written work&quot; from my son in Language Arts when we review <br/>\nagain in the Spring, and a &quot;written Project&quot; in Health. My question to <br/>\nyou, how do I provide these things to them while following an <br/>\nunschooling philosophy. What if my son doesn&#39;t want to do a written <br/>\nproject in Health or keep a journal (reviewer&#39;s suggestion)?  Do I <br/>\njust need to be creative about getting him to do these things....Any <br/>\nsuggestions welcomed.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nAmy <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cocobien@...\">cocobien@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8723,"nextTopicId":8750}}
