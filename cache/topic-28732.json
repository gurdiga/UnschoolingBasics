For me it&#39;s that worry that when they express an interest in<br/>\nsomething they hadn&#39;t mentioned before and I have a moment of panic in<br/>\nwondering if &quot;THAT&quot; is going to be their calling and unless I<br/>\nimmediately check out 10 library books, subscribe to 3 magazines and<br/>\nfind a mentor they are going to be behind in the game!     I want to<br/>\nbe supportive of their interests but I have to really fight the urge<br/>\nto saturate their environment with every resource on a topic they may<br/>\nmention ever so casually!    My husband and I are both &quot;hoarders&quot; of<br/>\ninformation in that when something strikes us we saturate ourselves in<br/>\nthat topic... two of our kids are like that and two are not.   I<br/>\nremember one of them wailing once after asking her dad a question<br/>\nabout something and having him go on and on for what seemed like<br/>\nforever &quot;I just wanted to know such and such!! I don&#39;t need a PhD in<br/>\nit!&quot;    <br/>\n<br/>\nI think also for alot of us that attended school and were parented in<br/>\n&quot;typical&quot;  60&#39;s and 70&#39;s fashion that even though our hearts know we<br/>\nare doing the right thing for our kids and that every moment they are<br/>\nlearning it&#39;s really stepping out of our comfort zone!    <br/>\n<br/>\n I just read a book titled &quot;Merle&#39;s Door  Lessons from a Freethinking<br/>\nDog&quot;  by Ted Kerasote.... just the best book I have read all year I<br/>\nthink!   Basically this fellow finds a stray dog while camping and<br/>\nadopts him ... since the dog has always had freedom it&#39;s quite a<br/>\njourney for Ted to figure out how to exist with this dog.  Basically<br/>\nan unschooling dog!   So many of the things really rang true with me<br/>\nas they relate to all relationships between people.    I am now<br/>\nreading a rather different book that caught my eye at the library by<br/>\nJane Isay titled &quot;Walking on Eggshells Navigating the Delicate<br/>\nRelationship Between Adult Children and Parents&quot;   The premise of this<br/>\nbook is that basically we are the first generation of children who<br/>\nwere parented in a more permissive time than our parents who were<br/>\nraised by WWII veterans and depression era folks.   It&#39;s really<br/>\ninteresting in that it gives a perspective of how parents interact<br/>\nwith their adult children and why there are so many issues (we all<br/>\nwrite about that sort of thing here all the time!).  Anyway that&#39;s my<br/>\nbook report for this week! HA! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway to get back to the topic... you probably are tired and grumpy<br/>\nand I think we return to our default setting on those days and that is<br/>\nto play the old tapes we have had since childhood that learning looks<br/>\na certain way to be valuable and the fear that someone will disapprove<br/>\nof what we are doing (which is funny given how little most of us care<br/>\nabout that sort of thing on a good day!)   <br/>\nTake a deep breath and know that he is learning and will be fine and<br/>\nanything he finds out he needs to know to be successful in something<br/>\nhe is passionate about he will also be passionate about learning in a<br/>\nvery short period of time when it&#39;s meaningful to him!  <br/>\nLisa Blocker</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Transition harder for me than my kid","postDate":"1199503108","msgId":28747,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZsbXN1NCtrZ2xkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZmZTliYzA2MDgwMTA0MDgyM3E2YTMwMWY5NnUyYWQzMDg1Y2E2MWU0MWZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":28745,"nextInTopic":28751,"prevInTime":28746,"nextInTime":28748,"topicId":28732,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~I can usually pick something out as a learning lesson~~ There is no need to pick out a learning lesson.

I have to say that the deschooling, at<br/>\nleast for me, is slightly more difficult than it was for my son. As for the<br/>\nvalue he is learning of himself, I can attest to that. My son has changed<br/>\nquite a bit in the fast few weeks. He used to be a very angry and defiant<br/>\nchild, now he laughs a lot easier and smiles more. He talks to me about<br/>\nthings that are not petty or about his recent fight with his brother. That<br/>\nhas been more than any school or institution has ever done. On that alone, I<br/>\nkeep reassuring myself this was the right thing to do. Also, knowing that my<br/>\nchild is an independent person, but with some insecurities and he was not,<br/>\nfor whatever reason out growing them, he is in a safe environment here at<br/>\nhome and he can express himself and try things without feeling like he is a<br/>\nfailure just because he did not catch on and do it right the first time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, his mother, my ex, is a &quot;professional educator&quot; and loves to tout how<br/>\nshe is one. Her whole self-esteem is wrapped up in that title, so even<br/>\nthough I know that she is not as good as she thinks she is, especially in<br/>\nwhat she has modeled at home in front of the kids, I am still pushing<br/>\nthrough all that in my journey of getting to the other side. What has made<br/>\nall this a little easier as well, besides the improvement in my child, is<br/>\nthe fact that I have always wondered to myself, why do I need to learn all<br/>\nthis stuff when I am not going to use a good bit of it on an every day basis<br/>\nin my career? So, slowly I&#39;m getting through. And, I did not make him do a<br/>\nworkbook, nor did I continue to stand over his shoulder and watch what game<br/>\nhe was playing on the computer. Or on his game cube, or DS. I could not do<br/>\nthat just because the gamer in my would not allow it.
