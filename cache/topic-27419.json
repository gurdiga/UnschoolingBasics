Dawn&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Dawn,<br/>\n<br/>\nHow old are your kids? That would be an important factor in this<br/>\nsituation. If they&#39;re real young, maybe just some redirection would work<br/>\nin the heat of the moment and then talking about it later on when the<br/>\nmoment has passed and everyone is calm.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are older so when they have a conflict, I help them through it<br/>\nif they can&#39;t come to a solution. In the beginning when we first adopted<br/>\nthem they had poor problem solving skills so I was there, helping them<br/>\nwork things out, but they&#39;re able to do more and more of that on their<br/>\nown now,  using skills they&#39;ve  learned over the last four years with<br/>\nus.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso...a big realization for me was what I was modeling. I really looked<br/>\nat how my husband & I handled conflict and we made some changes there<br/>\nalso.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo expect a child to know how to work out conflict without help is<br/>\nunrealistic. Even those of us who know how to do it sometimes need help.<br/>\nYou said that you feel like you make it worse. Maybe you could try a<br/>\ndifferent approach. Don&#39;t look at it as &quot;interfering&quot;. Look at it as<br/>\nbeing involved and connecting with your kids. Maybe tell that what<br/>\nworked for you in that situation. Maybe validate more and try to fix<br/>\nless.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Joanne ***<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":258070335,"authorName":"Nittany Lion","from":"Nittany Lion &lt;dsweeney@...&gt;","profile":"dawn_sweeney","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"sibling arguments","postDate":"1193675585","msgId":27419,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNTEwMWM4MWE0OSQ2MWY3NDkzMCQwMTAwMDAwYUBTd2VlbmV5Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGZnNHFiZSt0bG4wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":27421,"prevInTime":27418,"nextInTime":27420,"topicId":27419,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Do you fascilitate in any way arguments bw your kids?
