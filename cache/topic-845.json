Nor the point<br/>\neither. The list isn&#39;t to help people be &quot;good&quot; parents because &quot;good&quot; is<br/>\ntoo vague. People who make their kids do their curriculum each day are being<br/>\ngood parents (by their definition). People who spank their kids for<br/>\ndisobedience are being good parents (by their definition.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s important on a list is exchanging ideas in ways that are clear and<br/>\nwill help someone else get something the list is trying to offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone talks about how she needs to make her child do math every morning<br/>\nbecause he craves structure and she&#39;s a good mother and is giving him what<br/>\nhe&#39;s asking for, that doesn&#39;t help anyone understand the principles of<br/>\nunschooling nor help anyone apply the principles in their family.

(Maybe not.) But the<br/>\nsharing of it doesn&#39;t help anyone get closer to understanding unschooling.<br/>\nIt might help people understand the principle of doing what feels right and<br/>\nwhat works for their family. But parents who send their kids to school are<br/>\nusing that principle too. So it&#39;s not a very helpful principle when people<br/>\nhave come to a list to find a way to do something different, especially<br/>\nsomething that&#39;s bound to make them uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s more helpful to see the list as an information resource for<br/>\nthose who want to do what the list is offering to help people do. (What the<br/>\nlist offers is determined by Ren and Kelly and company.) People can come and<br/>\nsay &quot;I want to figure out how to let go of controls.&quot; And people can offer<br/>\nideas. But it&#39;s not a requirement that everyone should let go of controls.<br/>\n(Nor an invitation to discuss how we should all just do what works for our<br/>\nfamily.) There will be ideas and help in implementing those ideas that some<br/>\npeople won&#39;t have any interest in trying out. They can let that information<br/>\ngo by.

I&#39;d like to understand why some people see coercion<br/>\nand others see discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you equate being able to share and talk about what you do on a list as<br/>\npart of doing and learning about unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the problem is that people who love discussion lists (which this one<br/>\nis) see the sharing and talking on the list as separate from the practice of<br/>\nunschooling. The list is for ideas and information and things to think<br/>\nabout. It&#39;s like a book that talks back when they have a question :-) But<br/>\nonce they step away from the list, the ideas are theirs to do with what they<br/>\nwant. They can do them or not. Think about them or not. If they don&#39;t want<br/>\nto let go of bedtimes, they don&#39;t have to. If they want unschool except for<br/>\nmath, they can. They can adapt what they read to suit them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think talking about and sharing and trading what we do can be valuable but<br/>\nit&#39;s a separate thing from discussion. I think of that as support. And there<br/>\nare lists where the focus is support, where people kick back and share their<br/>\nhopes and fears and frustrations and get sympathy and support for who they<br/>\nare. There are face-to-face groups that are also for support.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, like unschooling, it&#39;s a matter of recognizing what we want and<br/>\nfinding a way to get it. Discussion *is* what many people want so people who<br/>\nlike discussion make lists so they and others like them can meet their need<br/>\nto discuss. Support is what many other people need. And there are separate<br/>\nlists for them. Support and discussion are different needs and those needs<br/>\nneed to be met in different ways. For someone to stay unhappily with a<br/>\ndiscussion list when what they need is support in order to unschool is like<br/>\na hands on child staying with books to learn about carpentry.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86288922,"authorName":"Sherri-Lee Pressman","from":"Sherri-Lee Pressman &lt;s-lp@...&gt;","profile":"sherrileepr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Supporting each other","postDate":"1088054145","msgId":938,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxZTYwMWM0NTlhYSQ0ZTE4MTUxMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBmbG9zc2llPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwNjI0MDUwMDM5LjU4MTQwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzODA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":937,"nextInTopic":949,"prevInTime":937,"nextInTime":939,"topicId":845,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hearing all of this really makes me feel validated.... and more and more convinced to home/unschool my kids (can t believe it is going to two this fall when I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1968425886\">Hearing all of this really makes me feel validated.... and more and more convinced to home/unschool my kids (can&#39;t believe it is going to two this fall when I think of it this way)<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic School was a horrible experience for me personally and I left there very damaged and today still work to heal from some of the damage inflicted on me while I was getting *socialized*.

My feeling is that children and adults go at their own pace no matter what anyone else says.  Personally, I wanted to know everything there was to know about unschooling as fast I could know it, but it was a painful growing experience.  Now, I seek out growth experiences because I know they are so amazingly great for my family.  Not everyone is the same.  So, every now and then there is a little grumbling about letting people progress at their own rate.  My feeling is that any step toward unschooling is positive for mom, dad, children, ..... world.  I am changing every day, trying to understand and communicate better/more effectively with people about unschooling and other things.  I am a radical unschooler and I want to help people where they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe both have the same goal in mind.  Mine approach is constantly changing, trying to get better.

Unfortunately, in parenting our children, we don&#39;t often have the luxury of taking babysteps in our own time.  We have to make our progress in our child&#39;s time, those early years that only come once and only last for a short time.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m speaking as the Mom of a grown child.  My oldest son is 19, and on his own now.  We didn&#39;t find homeschooling until he was 16 -- when he flat out told us he was not returning to school.  We registered him as a homeschooler, and let him learn on his own, with the requirement from us that he get his GED.  He did that, one year earlier than his scheduled graduation would have been.  A year later, we landed squarely into unschooling as a lifestyle, and the lives our younger sons (8 & 3) lead today are vastly better than the early years my oldest son lived.  I so wish I&#39;d known unschooling when my oldest was young.  He&#39;s living 19 better and happier than I did, but still there is so much he will have to undo and unlearn --  burdens I stuck him with because I was controlling in ways I have now given up.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt isn&#39;t always comfortable or easy to give up the controls, to let go of our timetable and cherished plans for our children, but it&#39;s essential if we&#39;re ever to recognize that their lives are their own.  In the grand scheme, it&#39;s much easier to just never set up those timetables and plans, sit back and watch our children&#39;s lives unfold, in their time.  Being a parent isn&#39;t about doing things in a way and time that meets our needs.  Being a parent, especially an unschooling parent, is about making sure our children have all the freedom and love they need to live their own lives.  It&#39;s about trusting that what the life they will live for their own soul will be so much more than we could have ever planned for them.  When our children are born, we don&#39;t know who they are or what they&#39;ll become, but if we plan it all out for them, we&#39;ll also never know what they could have become.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSorry if it&#39;s not always gentle to hear, but our kids don&#39;t have time to wait for us to feel comfortable in our own time.  It&#39;s not about us -- it&#39;s about them.<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nWe don&#39;t, imo, need to be pushed. We need to be allowed to get where we need to go in our own time. <br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

You don&#39;t <br/>\ndecide FOR the child that he/she is going to study American history <br/>\nthis year and Ancient History next year or chemistry this month and <br/>\nastronomy next month and so on. You do not have a little &quot;schoolhouse&quot; <br/>\nat home with you as the teacher and all the usual trappings of school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you do INSTEAD is going to be different in every family - and <br/>\nchange over time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the purpose of this list to talk about what unschooling is - to <br/>\nexplore answers to questions like: &quot;What is unschooling? How does it <br/>\nwork? How do unschooled children learn? Do they learn traditional <br/>\nschool subjects? Are they successful? (What IS success?) Without <br/>\nstructured lessons planned for them, how do they know what they should <br/>\nlearn? How do you know they HAVE learned, if they don&#39;t take tests? Can <br/>\nthey go to college? How do they learn to follow directions? How do they <br/>\never learn to do things they might not &quot;feel like&quot; doing? What does it <br/>\ntake to unschool? Can all parents unschool? Are there kids for whom <br/>\nunschooling is a mistake? How do we get started? What if my child has <br/>\nbeen in school or we&#39;ve been doing a formal school-at-home format? Is <br/>\nit unschooling if ---- I don&#39;t make my child learn anything? We use <br/>\ntextboooks?  I only make my child do math? We use a curriculum, but use <br/>\nit flexibly? My CHILD wants to use a curriculum?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the above and more are truly questions directly about <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT -<br/>\nThe other stuff talked about by unschoolers - not having fixed <br/>\nbedtimes, not having fixed limits on tv, letting kids choose their own <br/>\nfoods, etc., are all topics that can be seen more as &quot;potential side <br/>\neffects&quot; or &quot;possible repercussions&quot; of living an unschooling <br/>\nlifestyle. They don&#39;t define unschooling and there are plenty of people <br/>\nwho unschool and continue to impose limits on their kids in these and <br/>\nother areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason they come up in unschooling discussions so often is that <br/>\nonce people let go of control over their child&#39;s learning, and they <br/>\ncome to have confidence and trust in their children and themselves in <br/>\nthat<br/>\narea, it seems they naturally begin to experiment with &quot;letting go&quot; in <br/>\nother areas as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - when you&#39;re on an unschooling list, you are likely to run into <br/>\nquite a few people who have questioned all these other kinds of control <br/>\nover other aspects of children&#39;s lives, not just educational control.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel the need to repeat, over and over, these are things that many <br/>\nlong-time unschoolers have discovered to be the natural result of <br/>\nunschooling, but you certainly do NOT have to adopt them in order to <br/>\nunschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou unschool by dropping SCHOOLING - most especially the coercive <br/>\naspects of school!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care what we&#39;re called. My older kids think of themselves as <br/>\nunschoolers even though they both take community college courses in <br/>\nwhich they are clearly not &quot;unschooled.&quot; I don&#39;t think they are <br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; anymore - but unschooling is what they identify with - <br/>\nthey feel like, having been unschooled, they are now permanently <br/>\ngranted that particular identity. I don&#39;t care. If somebody said, &quot;But, <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t unschooling anymore!!&quot; I&#39;d agree. If somebody said, &quot;They <br/>\nARE grown unschoolers, still, because they were unschooled and now they <br/>\nare taking those college classes by choice,&quot; I&#39;d say, &quot;Yeah, okay.&quot; It <br/>\nSO doesn&#39;t matter to me what they are called. I don&#39;t have a strong <br/>\nurge to identify &quot;people&quot; by a particular title.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when I want to talk about unschooling - I want to talk about kids <br/>\nNOT going to school and not being taught in a school-like way by their <br/>\nparents at home. I want to know that THAT is what we&#39;re talking about - <br/>\nthat it doesn&#39;t make sense to say, &quot;We unschool using Calvert <br/>\nCurriculum.&quot; I want the term to be useful in discussions about how <br/>\nchildren learn without schooling of ANY kind. I don&#39;t want the <br/>\ndefinition so watered down that self-proclaimed unschoolers are sharing <br/>\ncurriculum tips and lesson plans with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople ask, &quot;Is it okay if.....?&quot;  I dunno. That&#39;s the best answer I <br/>\ncan give. Do people want my permission? Why on earth would they ask a <br/>\nlist of complete strangers if something is okay? I cringe when I see <br/>\nquestions starting that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if they ask, &quot;Is it unschooling if....?&quot; I think that is usually a <br/>\nquestion worth exploring.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it still unschooling if we impose bedtimes? Yes you could still be <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it still unschooling if we have limits and restrictions on tv or if <br/>\nwe don&#39;t have a tv at all? Yes you could still be unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it still unschooling if I make my kids eat their vegetables or <br/>\nfinish what they take or try a bite of anything new? Yes, you could <br/>\nstill be unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152271008,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"ruekream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Supporting each other","postDate":"1087952940","msgId":878,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMTUwMWM0NThiZSRhYjk1Mzc1MCQ2NDAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGJiLjQxODVjYWY1LjJlMGEyNmJlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":876,"nextInTopic":881,"prevInTime":877,"nextInTime":879,"topicId":845,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... **You can post in the way that you think is going to be most helpful.

New people like myself who are interested in an <br/>\nunschooling/gentle parenting lifestyle should be treated with the <br/>\nsame respect we give to our children.  I love to read about everyones <br/>\nviews on unschooling and parenting.  I came to unschooling by reading <br/>\npositive accounts of unschooling families.  The freedom to choose <br/>\nwhat is best for my children is what I love most about homeschooling. <br/>\nIf I ask for advice I have the freedom to take what works for me and <br/>\nleave the rest.  I choose to leave the negative stuff behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd anyway, doesn&#39;t it seem that there is a continuum involved here.  <br/>\nCan only the most radical unschoolers call themselves unschoolers?  I <br/>\nfeel like in my case I am easing into the waters instead of jumping <br/>\nin head first.  We still have certain controls in our house like <br/>\nbedtime for 3yo ds.  It&#39;s not set in stone, but there is a time range <br/>\nwe shoot for to have him in bed.  But 11 yo ds goes to bed when he is <br/>\ntired and wakes up when he is rested.  Someday my 3yo will do the <br/>\nsame as my 11yo.  But not before it feels right.  That doesn&#39;t mean <br/>\nI&#39;m not a gentle parent.

My name is Andrea, and my son is<br/>\nTobin (4).  I have belonged to other homeschooling/unschooling groups,<br/>\nand am not surprised that there are some purists screaming for purity.<br/>\nThis is, after all an unschooling group where we are talking about the<br/>\nbasics of unschooling.  However, the term &quot;unschooling&quot; has so many<br/>\ndifferent meanings to so many different FAMILIES.  Since the time John<br/>\nHolt began, unschooling has evolved and changed (just like any theory or<br/>\nreligion).  I&#39;m sure John Holt, after spending another 10 or so years,<br/>\nwould have said things that conflicted with original thoughts.  Is there<br/>\na rule book for unschooling?  Unschooling is very organic according to<br/>\neach family, and would not be unschooling if there were a rule book.  I<br/>\ndo believe we all have wonderful things to offer to this group.  Some<br/>\nmay be more aggressively purist in their posts, and some may get their<br/>\nfeelings hurt.  We probably can all agree that as the parent, we have a<br/>\nlot to learn.  There are ways to influence people without being<br/>\nnegative, or righteous.  There are also ways to hear criticism that<br/>\nwon&#39;t leave you feeling stupid.  This is not a religion.  This is a way<br/>\nof raising our kids to be confident self-learners.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTruly! Can&#39;t we take it down a notch on this list? If someone wants to <br/>\nconsider what they are doing is unschooling, who am I to tell them it&#39;s<br/>\nnot. I may <br/>\nnot be completely and radically unschooling according to some. But it&#39;s<br/>\nthe <br/>\ncategory I feel comfortable in.
