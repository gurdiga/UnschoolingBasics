Shift your agenda to helping things be more <br/>\npleasant for her when she&#39;s tired. Use the energy you have early in <br/>\nthe day (maybe before she&#39;s awake, even) to set things up for later - <br/>\neasy snacks, drinks in individual containers, that sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the day, look for ways to help her rest when she&#39;s tired. Its <br/>\nprobably better at this point to look for that during the day, so she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get the idea that you&#39;re trying to get her to sleep. People <br/>\nhave natural ups and downs during the day - part of what&#39;s going on <br/>\nwith your dd right now is she&#39;s learning about what that feels like <br/>\nand how to deal with it. What do adults do when they run out of steam <br/>\nat 2 o&#39;clock in the afternoon? Snacks help.

And here&#39;s is why I am posting... I am by nature a morning person. I<br/>\nfeel so much better and more patient in the morning and early parts of the<br/>\nday.

By the time<br/>\ndinner rolls around, I am winding down myself (as much as a workaholic can<br/>\n:-) and eager to do things like get the dinner food in the fridge and do<br/>\nsome things that will make the next day smoother. My patience wanes when<br/>\ntrying to help her in the evenings these days. Tonight I have a rare<br/>\nopportunity as her brother (10) will be away camping and I can plan better<br/>\nto focus on her tonight. Any suggestions for what to do differently to help<br/>\nher rest well tonight?
