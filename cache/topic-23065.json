The flip side is<br/>\nthat it takes a lot of willingness on our part to actually PLAY.<br/>\nFortunately, DH is a gamer from way back (original Atari and such) which<br/>\nsuits DS just fine since he LOVES videogames - PS2, GBA, and now the new<br/>\nDS systems (we have two GBAs and two DS&#39; so that DH and DS can link up<br/>\nto do stuff as well as play separately). We also need to be willing to<br/>\nbalance stuff like cleaning, cooking, bill paying, et al with things<br/>\nlike board games, videogames, imaginary play (such as &quot;Bionicle battles&quot;<br/>\nwhere my team of Bionicles &quot;battles&quot; DS&#39; team of Bionicles - requires<br/>\nlots of imaginary work because each Bionicle can have different &#39;powers&#39;<br/>\nand &#39;attacks&#39; - DS was pretty impressed at some of the tactics I<br/>\n&#39;invented&#39; here and there since I&#39;m &quot;just a Mom&quot; not a kid! lol) <br/>\n <br/>\nSome days are packed with activity, other days are pretty mellow.<br/>\nSometimes we propose ideas, sometimes DS expresses a desire to see, do,<br/>\ntry something so we work on meeting that. For instance, this past<br/>\nFriday, I had the day off from work (I WOH fulltime, DH is home<br/>\nfulltime, works out great for us this way). Last weekend DH had<br/>\nmentioned he had never been to Dinosaur State Park here in CT. So, I<br/>\nsuggested (weather permitting) that we do that on my day off just for<br/>\nfun. Time spent was open ended - their site says to allow about 1 1/2<br/>\nhrs but we were willing to spend anywhere from 1/2 an hour to all<br/>\nafternoon until they close there. We had a GREAT time - spent about an<br/>\nhour inside (20 minute video plus walking around looking at the<br/>\npreserved in situ trackways) then went outside and despite the chill air<br/>\nwalked the nature trails for probably an hour. Then we headed home, ate<br/>\ndinner, and headed out to Starbucks for an after dinner &quot;treat&quot; (and I<br/>\nuse that word loosely since we are at Starbucks at least once a week if<br/>\nnot more lol). Then back home again to unwind with some favorite TV<br/>\nprogramming (which I usually watch while the guys watch and play their<br/>\nhandheld games as well). <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m usually the &quot;activity finder&quot; - I keep my eyes out on town parks &<br/>\nrec events, local homeschooling activities (we have our hand in 3 or 4<br/>\ndifferent groups), movie theater schedules, and so on. I winnow through<br/>\nthe piles of options and introduce the stuff that looks potentially<br/>\ninteresting. Lots of discussion ensues. Plans occur. Some things that<br/>\nlook interesting might be scheduled for a time when we know we&#39;ll<br/>\nalready be pretty &quot;activitied out&quot;, other things might not be as<br/>\ninteresting as they initially looked once we investigate further, and<br/>\nother stuff gets put on the calendar. In the process, other things might<br/>\nbubble up that get checked into and around we go again. For instance,<br/>\nthe trip to the dinosaur park this past week might (or might not)<br/>\nproduce a request to (a) go back there (b) find similar places to visit<br/>\n(c) find closer to home hiking/nature trails to try out (d) something<br/>\nelse entirely that is off on a tangent from one or more threads.<br/>\n <br/>\nI like what Kathryn said about the whole family being learners, not<br/>\nsolely the child (or children - this one applies to pretty much all<br/>\nfamilies). We all have stuff that we are interested in, stuff that<br/>\noverlaps each other, stuff that is an individual interest, etc. Both DH<br/>\nand DS are gamers - I get dizzy playing most of the videogames they<br/>\nlike, and they know it. *However* I make a point to learn at least the<br/>\nrudiments of what they&#39;re talking about (character names, abilities,<br/>\ngood things, not so good things, and so on). I know, for instance, that<br/>\nelectric type Pokemon are good against Water types but not against<br/>\nGround types. Not earth shaking stuff by any means BUT it is important<br/>\nto DS. That&#39;s *my* learning - I&#39;m willing to learn about it from DS<br/>\nrather than brush it off. He was quite proud of me the other day when I<br/>\nstarted playing a Pokemon game on the GBA and actually *captured* a wild<br/>\nPokemon! <br/>\n <br/>\nDS goes in and out of times he plays alone and times he wants to play<br/>\ntogether. There are a few folks that we get together with regularly to<br/>\nplay and hang out - one family of homeschoolers particularly (they have<br/>\n3 kids, one is a tad younger than DS and twins a tad older than DS), for<br/>\nthem it is nice because the younger one and DS hit it off particularly<br/>\n(we met up at a homeschool park day and after several weeks of DS and N<br/>\nplaying together the whole time, we arranged a separate time to get<br/>\ntogether - it&#39;s been close to 4 yrs now) which &quot;evens&quot; things a bit<br/>\nsince the older twins tend to play together much of the time, and the<br/>\nyounger sometimes is left out slightly. And sometimes, at home, DS wants<br/>\nto play in parallel rather than together - he just wants someone nearby<br/>\nto talk to while he&#39;s doing something.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

We<br/>\nseem to have cycles of being busy away from home and cycles of being<br/>\nhomebodies. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe kind of fly by the seat of our pants. I think that is easier with one,<br/>\nbut I have no experience with more than one so I don&#39;t really know. I know<br/>\nif I had multiple children I would be stretched to pay for all the things ds<br/>\nlikes to do plus other children&#39;s ideas BUT I also know a few people who are<br/>\nquite inventive at trading and bartering to help their kids pursue their<br/>\ninterests. Most of the people I know who have multiple kids are ALWAYS on<br/>\nthe go. I get tired just listening to one day of what they have. There seems<br/>\nto be less flexibility to just drop everything and go on an adventure. If I<br/>\nget a wild idea to head down to Washington DC to go to the National Mall for<br/>\nthe day or into Philly or NYC I can do that because there aren&#39;t a lot of<br/>\nobligations we carry, ds is pretty easy going about stuff like that and the<br/>\ncosts are generally pretty reasonable. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI like the flexibility and freedom I feel like I have with just one child to<br/>\nfacilitate experiences for. I like that I can just be fully present with ds<br/>\nwithout having to juggle the needs/emotions of other children. I like that<br/>\nmany of our interests are the same so we have lots of time together and many<br/>\nof our interests are different so we have lots of time to pursue something<br/>\non our own. I like the balance we have achieved in our interactions and<br/>\ncommunication. I like being able to have a smaller vehicle. I like having<br/>\nenough monetary resource that I can buy the quality of food that I can and<br/>\nfocus on one child&#39;s eating habits/needs instead of trying to juggle<br/>\nmultiple. I like that I will not have a child that feels like I play<br/>\nfavorites with a sibling when I am doing my very best to meet everyone&#39;s<br/>\nneeds. I like that I will only ever have one sick child at a time to deal<br/>\nwith, especially when I have been sick too. Plus unless I adopt there won&#39;t<br/>\nbe any other children in our family. So I kind of just got used to the idea<br/>\nof one child. I enjoy his company and with the health challenges I have<br/>\nfaced I don&#39;t think I would be very effective as a parent of more than one<br/>\nchild.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other side of it that I see from my perspective though is that with more<br/>\nthan one child, if they get along, share common interests etc., they have a<br/>\nready made playmate. I am sure there are a great number of other reasons too<br/>\nthat I am not aware of. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I can see that there might be parts of each situation that could be a<br/>\nbenefit. I am sure there are things he will feel he missed out on. We are<br/>\nfriends with a family that he tells me he wants to live with so he can have<br/>\na brother. (He wants us to live in their basement). I know sometimes when we<br/>\ngo to places like the Franklin Institute he wishes there were other kids<br/>\nwith us for him to share the experience with. So we try to invite others to<br/>\ngo with us as often as possible. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not quite sure what the meaning of &quot;only child syndrome&quot; is here<br/>\nthough. I have only heard that in a negative connotation meaning a child is<br/>\n&quot;spoiled&quot; because they haven&#39;t been &quot;made&quot; to learn to share their parents,<br/>\ntoys, resources or whatever and will never learn to get along with others in<br/>\nthe real world. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nlisa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:Help!

It just seems to me families with 2 or 3 or even <br/>\n4  kids, their kids seems to be doing so much more. They seems to go <br/>\noff and  occupy each other. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI have one unschooled kid, Julian, now 17. I always read about these lovely  <br/>\nfamilies with seven children off writing screenplays together, etc. after  <br/>\nfeeding and milking the goats. (If you have a family of seven screenplay-writing  <br/>\ngoat farming, note that I&#39;m sort of jealous. Not being sarcastic at all.)<br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooling an only kid is awesome. Repeat after me: no sibling fighting.  No <br/>\nstresses when the kids have extremely differing needs. More resources for the <br/>\n kid. Certainly there are advantages to having a bunch, but the only <br/>\nunschooled  kids I know are amazing. They are SOOO lucky!  -- no school, and you don&#39;t <br/>\n have to share the parents. I mean, come on!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;1.

Where do you go? What do you do? Do you go  <br/>\nseeking for activities Or do you create them? &lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s gonna depend on the kid. I can see unschooling parents of kids who  need <br/>\nlots of constant attention wishing for days like you probably have every  <br/>\nday. It sounds like you have a happy, maybe introverted kid who has lots to do.  <br/>\nI have one of them. It can feel like you&#39;re not important, but you are. It&#39;s  <br/>\njust more subtle.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen Julian was little we joined a local group run by a friend of mine that  <br/>\nplanned lots of &quot;field Trips.&quot;  Each few months we&#39;d read the newsletter  and <br/>\nsign up for the stuff that sounded cool. It gave Juls and me a chance to  <br/>\nconnect with some other homeschoolers (even some unschoolers) and gave us stuff  <br/>\nto look forward to. I mean, the chances of it&#39;s occurring to us top go to the  <br/>\nPlastics Museum was slim, but it was really cool! If it will interest both of  <br/>\nyou, do something like that....sometimes it&#39;s nice to have things to do that <br/>\nyou  don&#39;t have to think up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;2.

He&#39;s very lucky that he has some awesome people that  mean <br/>\nso much to him.  Think about getting to an unschooling conference so  he can <br/>\nstart making connections now. You too. <br/>\n <br/>\nDon&#39;t worry.
