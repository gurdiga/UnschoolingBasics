It includes many of the things that you voiced a concern<br/>\nabout.

I&#39;m quite proud of myself, actually!  I have seen firsthand how stress has really dissipated from our home and how the relationship between Tristan and I has improved.  I do have a question, though, when it comes to safety related issues.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an example that&#39;s arisen over the past day or so....Right now there are a number of folks who are setting up their trampolines in our neighborhood, and Tristan is wanting, of course, to be a part of the fun.  To be honest, I&#39;m not comfortable AT ALL with him playing on one in our neighborhood.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know trampolines aren&#39;t inherently dangerous.  I remember as a kid playing on them, and they are darn fun, I admit!!  The thing is, there is absolutely NO adult supervision of any kind in our neighborhood (I&#39;ve seen 2-yr-olds wandering around ALONE for long periods of time).  It&#39;s not uncommon to see 8-10 people at a time on these tramps.  Tristan (9) actually helped construct one today (with a 12-yr-old).  No adults even bothered to check it over once the KIDS put it together....<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I knew there were certain principles regarding safety and supervision at these homes, I wouldn&#39;t have much of a problem.  Now I know if I give Tristan a resounding &quot;NO&quot; in regards to trampolines, they are bound to become an irresistible forbidden fruit to him.  Should I simply talk to him about the safety issues I&#39;m concerned about?  What if he still doesn&#39;t see the potential dangers?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know my best bet is to try to find a safe environment for him to play on one, but I don&#39;t know of ANYONE who has a trampoline where he can safely bounce to his heart&#39;s content.  Talking to the parents who own these trampolines isn&#39;t much of an option either.  Most are quite hostile and really don&#39;t see anything dangerous about the situation.  Unfortunately, we can&#39;t get our own trampoline, as our yard just couldn&#39;t handle its size (we all have teeny, tiny yards...some of these tramps are mere inches from the street).<br/>\n<br/>\nAny insight from y&#39;all would be greatly appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nMalinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12738,"nextTopicId":12743}}
