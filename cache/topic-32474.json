And then my very schooled brain gears up and says, but maybe they&#39;re right to be setting limits, blah blah blah, even though I KNOW in my heart of hearts that giving my girls true freedom and completely trusting them is the right thing, and it&#39;s what is making Ryan and I grow and grow and grow like we&#39;ve never grown before.  I just so want to have the experience of hanging out with parents who don&#39;t set limits, and to experience for myself firsthand that the kids are turning out just fine, and are in fact<br/>\n great kids.  I mean I&#39;ve read about lots of your kids here and in books and on websites, and I&#39;m sure they ARE great, but it&#39;s all still so far-removed from my in-the-flesh reality that my crazy brain still engages with bullshit about whether I&#39;m doing the right thing or not.  I would LOVE to make it to a conference, but they&#39;re just too darn far away, and we just don&#39;t have the money to do it this year, so for now, I just feel lonely in radical-unschooling land!  I was so excited today about meeting some long-time unschoolers, and it turned out so differently than I expected.  Thanks for listening, I honestly don&#39;t know where else to pour out this discouragement.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi  <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

I thought it&#39;s fun to clean your teeth when there&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; visual of colors, it&#39;s like washing off paint. you can also show<br/>\n&gt; pictures of the tooth structure, when its just the enamel part, it<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t hurt yet, but when it goes deeper then you&#39;d feel it. then<br/>\n&gt; kids are somehow become self motivated. I thought, it&#39;s loving to<br/>\n&gt; encourage children to care for their teeth for some prevention than<br/>\n&gt; just let them experience the dental work needed. sorry, I, myself<br/>\n&gt; still shed a tear or two when I&#39;m on a dental chair, so it&#39;s hard for<br/>\n&gt; me to see kids screaming during drill time. I believe genes,<br/>\n&gt; nutrition, injury & hygiene determines teeth conditions. If you got<br/>\n&gt; good genes, happy you. If you don&#39;t, it&#39;s nice to care about the 3<br/>\n&gt; other ones. I didn&#39;t say, you have to force or scare. you explain it<br/>\n&gt; in a fun way, you can even sing while the child is brushing. when a<br/>\n&gt; child have colds or cough, you don&#39;t say that they&#39;re monsters in<br/>\n&gt; their nose or hands, they&#39;re just germs that needs to be washed away<br/>\n&gt; or get rid off, & careful not to spread it around.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Plus, a mom told me, she went to a community dental clinic for her<br/>\n&gt; son&#39;s dental work. She was told that they will eventually report her<br/>\n&gt; to CPS for neglect, if the lack of hygiene continues. I thought, it<br/>\n&gt; was absurd, but that happened to her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;a scary lie, malicious & evil!&quot; Oh, my goodness! That just makes me<br/>\n&gt; feel so welcome in this group! I thought, with suggestions, if<br/>\n&gt; someone finds it good or helpful...then great. If not, oh well...next.<br/>\n&gt; my first reaction was, &quot;WOW!&quot; I guess, that&#39;ll also be my last.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lorelei<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt; <br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But that is a lie, and a scary lie at that..

I&#39;ve been around for only about 10 months, so I consider myself a newbie too.  On the description and suggestions on the yahoo group when you signed up, it is suggested to read for a few weeks or more to find out the tone of the group, find out more, and definitely wait awhile before offering suggestions.  To protect the integrity of the group and unschooling principles, there are those here that will take umbrage to any talk that doesn&#39;t fully embrace trusting our kids, and not parenting by fear, punishment, bribery, or scare tactics.  So I would encourage you to read, read, read, because there really is tons of wisdom and insight on this list.  I for one have learned TONS.  And it&#39;s not personal, that&#39;s what took a month or so for me to get.

The bacteria in your mouth don&#39;t destroy your teeth, it&#39;s the acids the bacteria produce that destry the enamel on your teeth. I wasn&#39;t a good brusher and didn&#39;t have any tooth decay until I was an adult, so brushing my teeth didn&#39;t seem to be necessary to guard my teeth from caries. Yes there are bugs on your teeth, but they aren&#39;t there digging into your teeth until a child screams. That&#39;s just so malicious and evil. They are just making a living eating the food that you eat. And no matter how hard you brush you won&#39;t get rid of all of them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is interesting, I&#39;ve just been doing a quick and cursory exploration of the world of oral bacteria via google and found this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.db.od.mah.se/car/data/kohlermut.html\">http://www.db.od.mah.se/car/data/kohlermut.html</a> which shows that the earlier you get mutans streptococci the more prone to caries/cavities you are, with absolutely no discussion of how much you brush or floss your teeth. Here&#39;s an abstract about the natural history of  Streptoccus sanguinis (a benign oral bacteria) <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/7/4018\">http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/7/4018</a> I think I like it most because it refers to oral bacteria as &quot;indigenous biota of the human oral cavity&quot;. Oh, how I love science!! There is this talk abstract: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://iadr.confex.com/iadr/2002SanDiego/techprogram/abstract_18332.htm\">http://iadr.confex.com/iadr/2002SanDiego/techprogram/abstract_18332.htm</a> which found no difference in colonization of mutans streptococci in caries free Swedish teenagers and caries prevelant Swedish teenagers. Similar finding here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jdr.iadrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/77/10/1851\">http://jdr.iadrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/77/10/1851</a> with the added<br/>\n comment that it isn&#39;t diet that is doing it. Oh, I could do this for a long time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really cool. It isn&#39;t scary, or something to be used to scare a child with, they are cavities, holes in your teeth caused by acids. The bacteria, the indigenous biota, are just living there, they are indigenous. Well, they are indigenous from about 30 months old, on average. Yes, toothbrushing makes a difference <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowAbstract&ArtikelNr=16503&Ausgabe=225458&ProduktNr=224219\">http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowAbstract&ArtikelNr=16503&Ausgabe=225458&ProduktNr=224219</a> (an old paper, 1999, but cool for the British social class stuff -- I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s what the manual versus non-manual mention is about).  A big difference. But it isn&#39;t going to keep you clear of caries if you are prone to getting them. Hard cheese is supposed to be quite good for regulating the population of mutans streptococci, quick search shows that lactobacilli tends to keep populations of mutans streptococci in check. Xylitol has been shown to reduce plaque and when mother&#39;s chew it for the first couple of years of<br/>\n their child&#39;s life the colonization of the child&#39;s teeth by mutans streptococci is delayed and thus caries are less likely to occur. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want monsters in my mouth, it would scare me. I&#39;d much rather indigenious biota sharing my body with me, I can enjoy that, while doing a bit of culling to keep the population for getting out of hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--try the pink chewable tablet that shows all the bacteria, ask your <br/>\ndentist about it. explain to the child that the sugarbugs loves to dig <br/>\nholes & hide inside the tooth. the toothbrush/toothpaste brushes/washes <br/>\nthem out, make sure not to miss any tooth & spit out all the sugarbugs <br/>\nin the sink or else, the bugs stays to dig & dig until child screams <br/>\nbecause of pain or the dentist has to do it. hope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nLorelei<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":238795563,"authorName":"Lisa","from":"&quot;Lisa&quot; &lt;jlblock01@...&gt;","profile":"jlblock01","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Teeth brushing","postDate":"1210247957","msgId":32500,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ2dXB1bCt0dWIyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ2dDFkdCtwbmJrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32494,"nextInTopic":32507,"prevInTime":32499,"nextInTime":32501,"topicId":32474,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a child in the exact situation....
