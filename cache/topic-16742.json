I did find out a little more regarding the GED and ranks. He said the army treats diplomas and GEDs the same, but he thinks the army is the only branch that will accept a GED. Regarding rank, there are several ways for an army recruit to start out higher than an E-1 (lowest rank). The more college credits you have, the higher the rank you can start at. JROTC or Civil Air Patrol experience (not sure if these are available outside of public schools or not), being an Eagle Scout, or participating in the army&#39;s &quot;new recruit&quot; program are other ways to advance in rank before actually leaving for training. <br/>\n <br/>\nTina, if you need any more info regarding the army, please feel free to email me anytime.

He says a person needs one of the following: a diploma, <br/>\ncertificate of completion, GED or 15 credit hours from a community <br/>\ncollege. He&#39;s still new at recruiting so he&#39;s not exactly sure what is <br/>\nacceptable and what&#39;s not, but he&#39;s going to ask his station commander <br/>\nand get back to me. Personally, I have a hard time believing they&#39;d <br/>\nturn anyone away that scored well on the ASVAB just because they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have one of the above. They seem to really be hurting for <br/>\nrecruits right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nStacy Murphy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":263883708,"authorName":"camden","from":"&quot;camden&quot; &lt;ccoutlaw@...&gt;","profile":"ccoutlaw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: records- military","postDate":"1156515406","msgId":16742,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjYwMWM2Yzg1MSRiNDhjMmYzMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBob21lPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVjbXVlbCtiaWVpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16754,"prevInTime":16741,"nextInTime":16743,"topicId":16742,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"****What about a military minded child? **** We just went thru this.

Our oldest (still at home) wants to go into the army. The recruiter said the Army&#39;s requirement is ....... a high school diploma.  And yes, you the parent can issue the diploma.  We asked him if ds would be better with a GED and they said no, a parent issued diploma along with a very basic transcript is perfectly fine.  I don&#39;t know about the other branches but this is what the Army says.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16731,"nextTopicId":16780}}
