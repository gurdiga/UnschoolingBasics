I guess I just don&#39;t understand the <br/>\nwhole ideology of &#39;pushing the baby birds out of the nest as soon as <br/>\npossible&#39; that seem to be the mindset very popular now.

I don&#39;t mean to offend anyone by writing that, but I just am <br/>\nso GLAD and RELIEVED to read posts from people who are choosing the <br/>\nsame things I am and ENJOYING it. I am still nursing my Lil&#39; Miss <br/>\nwho turns two next month... I am reticent to give it up but I am <br/>\nbeing pressured to do so from many who think she is much too old for <br/>\nit anymore... So reading your posts about children much older than <br/>\nthat still nursing did me some real good! Thanks so much for all the <br/>\nlovely stories. I, too, think I will really miss my kids sleeping <br/>\nwith us when they go on to thier own beds. I think I sleep better <br/>\nfor having them close by as well. Attachement parenting is really, I <br/>\nthink, the natural human continuum and I feel sorry, really, for <br/>\npeople that don&#39;t allow themselves to experience it.

He was 4 at the <br/>\ntime.  He still came in with us now and then but now sleeps so hard through <br/>\nthe night that he never does this anymore.  My now 6 year old still climbs <br/>\nin with us in the middle of the night now and then, but generally starts out <br/>\nthe night in the bed he shares with his older brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a disability, and insomnia is a big part of it.  It is hard for me to <br/>\nhave my son come in with us in the middle of the night and then sleep <br/>\nbecause he&#39;s a flopper.  I&#39;ve found that if I take him back to his bed and <br/>\nlie with him for a while, he&#39;ll go back to sleep quite quickly and be happy. <br/>\nI can then go back to my bed and TRY to fall asleep.  I also find that if I <br/>\nlie with the boys for a bit when they go to bed, they will tend to stay in <br/>\nbed all night.  Maybe it&#39;s that they had the closeness they needed when they <br/>\nfell asleep and sleep better.  I don&#39;t know.  I can see the 6 year old <br/>\nstarting to sleep harder, like his brother, and the times he comes in are <br/>\ngetting less and less often.  But I make no issue of it when he comes in and <br/>\nactually give him some props when he makes it through the night in his own <br/>\nbed, only because it makes such a huge difference in my sleeping.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s probably not all that helpful, but all I can say is that I know they <br/>\nwill be off, sleeping completely on their own, soon enough.  While I do <br/>\nappreciate the empty bed now and then, I just remind myself how soon they <br/>\nwill be gone and how much I will likely long for that nighttime cuddle.  It <br/>\nmakes me appreciate it all a bit more and be MUCH more patient with the <br/>\nwhole thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":280852700,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"&quot;Schuyler&quot; &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyler_waynforth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] cosleeping","postDate":"1163612071","msgId":18923,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYjkwMWM3MDhkYyQ1MTQ5YjIwMCQ0MDAxYThjMEBEYXZpZD4=","referencesHeader":"PGVqZmVmOCt2YmxjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18922,"nextInTopic":18924,"prevInTime":18922,"nextInTime":18924,"topicId":18920,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Simon stayed in our bedroom, not in our bed, until he was 7 or 8.

If there were more room I imagine he would return occassionally. Actually, recently, we moved to the biggest bedroom briefly and he came and joined us for a little while. He sleeps on the couch most nights. Never in his own room. <br/>\n<br/>\nLinnaea, who is 6, still sleeps with us. She has spent nights away and nights in her own room, but mostly she sleeps with us. I have no idea when that won&#39;t be. But, than, I have no aspirations for her to leave. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose the most limiting aspect of our sleep arrangements has nothing to do with where anyone sleeps. It is more about when. David (dh) goes to sleep between 9:00 and 11:00 most nights. Simon and Linnaea tend to stay up &#39;til closer to midnight. Both like me to cuddle them to sleep. So, by the time I get to bed David is deeply asleep and I&#39;m tired. That is far more limiting on my night-time freedom than sharing a room. <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid has just put together a paper on child stress and co-sleeping. Apparently children who co-sleep have lower stress levels, and return to a more normal level after a stressful encounter than do their non-cosleeping peers. I&#39;ve always liked having those sorts of stats in my head so that I can answer any of those little niggles or naysayers whenever I feel required to do so.

With my first I was a single Mom until he was almost 10.  He always started the night in his own bed, then usually moved to mine in the very-early morning hours, until he was about 8-ish.  Andy shared our bed every night, until his younger brother came along when he was 4.5.  For the first few months, he continued to sleep with us, tho it eventually got crowded.  Until he was 7 or so, dh would lie down with Andy, often falling asleep and spending most of the night with Andy, while I slept with Dan.  Somewhere around 8, Andy started staying up late watching TV to fall asleep, after reading with dh, and he wouldn&#39;t dream of climbing into our bed now at 10.  Dan, at 5.5, is still in our bed every night.  About half the time, he will ask to snuggle with me or dh in bed and fall asleep that way, the other half, he passes out on the couch, and we move him to our bed later.  He weaned just shy of his 5th birthday, so until that time,<br/>\n he nursed to sleep with me.  Rarely, he&#39;ll fall asleep in his own bed watching TV.  When he does that, we usually leave him there -- unless we know dh won&#39;t feel like waking to get Dan at 3am! -- he&#39;s not made it all night just yet.  He blames it on the dog or cat making too much noise.....<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So, based on my experience 8 is the average age for the end of co-sleeping, but your mileage may vary.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Mom to<br/>\n  Will (21) Andy (10) and Dan (5-1/2) <br/>\n   <br/>\n  www.ourhapahome.blogspot.com<br/>\n   <br/>\n    Life is what happens while youre busy making other plans. ~ John Lennon<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nCheck out the all-new Yahoo!
