After much <br/>\ndeliberation and looking at alternatives, it seems the 2005 <br/>\nconference would be better off in a city other than Pensacola. I <br/>\nhave been looking forward to this and planning for months, so it&#39;s <br/>\nreally hard to let this go, I hope you&#39;ll all understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nHurricane Ivan did so much damage, I don&#39;t believe Pensacola is any <br/>\nlonger the best location for 2005. Before I could get information <br/>\nfrom the beach, I believed we could still pull it together. After <br/>\ncontacting the hotels last week, it&#39;s very apparent that nothing <br/>\nwill be resolved in time for me to put on a wonderful event. Several <br/>\nhotels, including the Clarion, were so badly damaged they don&#39;t even <br/>\nthink they will rebuild...ever.<br/>\nThere is only one hotel that can handle our needs and it is <br/>\nexpensive (even by beach standards) and not interested in helping me <br/>\nmuch due to their new monopoly. I don&#39;t think I can get anyone a <br/>\ngood rate in this circumstance and you all deserve the best.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly and Ben have agreed to host the 2005 conference in St. Louis <br/>\nand will have details for you shortly. I plan to host the 2006 <br/>\nconference here in Pensacola, which is really exciting, as it will <br/>\nbe the Live and Learn five year anniversary conference!! I promise <br/>\nit will be an exciting event.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, please spread the word about next year and I hope <br/>\neveryone will get on board in supporting Kelly by volunteering! I <br/>\nwill be in charge of the raffle this time around, so you KNOW I&#39;ll <br/>\nbe bugging you all.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance for your understanding in this situation. I <br/>\nknow it&#39;s not an easy thing to change plans midstream, but I know <br/>\nSt. Louis will be very exciting and Live and Learn will continue to <br/>\ngrow and evolve as the BEST unschooling conference ever!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Feel free to pass this along to other lists.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4277,"nextTopicId":4288}}
