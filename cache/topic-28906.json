By presuming this kind <br/>\nof positive intent on their part it becomes easier and more <br/>\ncomfortable to communicate with them; you are no longer trying to <br/>\njustify yourself, but rather simply seeking to reassure them. And <br/>\nsince the person you will be dealing with is likely to have <br/>\nrelatively little experience with unschooling, they may actually be <br/>\nquite fascinated by whatever experiences you would be willing to <br/>\nshare with them. This then could actually become an experience you <br/>\ncould look forward to - its an opportunity to practice expressing <br/>\nwhat the philosophy of unschooling is to someone unfamiliar with it, <br/>\nand perhaps succeed in bringing one more person into the unschooling <br/>\ncommunity. Personally I often begin with the analogy: think of a <br/>\npublic school classroom being improved by dramatically reducing the <br/>\nclass sizes, and introducing individualized instruction, while <br/>\nproviding much greater access to the world and time for uninterrupted <br/>\nmusing, pondering, and reflection. Put it that way and everyone will <br/>\nfind it attractive, but seemingly impossible to provide.Then point <br/>\nout how similar that is to the kind of learning environment that you <br/>\nare attempting to provide for your own children, together perhaps <br/>\nwith other homeschooling parents. They&#39;re not likely to &quot;get&quot; <br/>\nimmediately the distinction between teaching and sharing/facilitating <br/>\ninterests, but you don&#39;t need to bring them quite that far to feel <br/>\nthat you&#39;ve met a possible friend rather than an adversary.<br/>\nI might add that many people who are not unschooling experience the <br/>\nword as rather negative and challenging or threatening - I choose to <br/>\nexplain it by saying that it just means the process of letting go of <br/>\nharmful assumptions about education and harmful attitudes toward <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\nI very much doubt that this was your main source of anxiety and <br/>\nconfusion, but by addressing this one issue fully and completely I <br/>\nthink you may be more able to tune in to the nature of your anxiety <br/>\nconnected to learning and teaching arithmetic.<br/>\nI might add that I once saw on Oprah three adults who had successful <br/>\ncareers and lives and who were now confessing that they never learned <br/>\nhow to read. The audience applauded them for finally confessing their <br/>\nshame and for somewhat painfully submitting to the process of being <br/>\ntaught, and happy that they reported making progress. Somehow no one <br/>\nsaw fit to comment that apparently one can become perfectly <br/>\nsuccessful without knowing how to read!<br/>\nIf your daughter can sing like Madonna and is a good judge of people, <br/>\nshe can always hire someone else to manage her finances and to do any <br/>\narithmetic that might be necessary. ^_^.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Mark V.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tina Bragdon&quot; <br/>\n&lt;jamesandtina942@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi, I am asking these questions as I know many of you have older <br/>\n&gt; children than mine and the benefit of time and experience, and also <br/>\n&gt; asking them in light of &quot;strewing&quot; and if it is manipulative, about <br/>\n&gt; teaching vs being a facilitator, and of having faith that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>unschooling <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; will be &quot;enough&quot; if that makes any sense.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am having a hard time overcoming my math fears and trying to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>relax <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; about it, especially now that dd is of mandatory school age in my <br/>\n&gt; province and I have to submit progress reports (no <br/>\n </span></blockquote>actual &quot;evidence&quot;) <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; twice a year.

How very true!  I was a teacher for<br/>\n12 years, and ultimately left the profession because I couldn&#39;t reconcile<br/>\nwithin myself the huge gap between what my expertise (and research, and<br/>\n-yes- college education) had taught me about how children learn and what the<br/>\nschools did to &quot;teach&quot; the various subjects!  And it isn&#39;t like I don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand the huge difficulty that is place before the teachers when they<br/>\nhave 30+ kids to a classroom.  But I don&#39;t think that excuses doing what is<br/>\n*easy* over doing what is right  (I actually had an administrator scold me<br/>\nfor creating a curriculum that was individualized to each student-because it<br/>\nwas *too much work* --for ME, not the kids!  Ugh!).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this post came at a great time for my family.  My husband and I are<br/>\nin the process of deschooling ourselves and entering into unschooling our 3<br/>\nof our children.  My husband and I talk about this topic of unschooling math<br/>\noften.  His concern is what if Jonah (8- and the oldest who will be<br/>\nunschooled) in his teens (or pre-teens-or whenever) decides on a career path<br/>\nthat he did not consider in his *early years* and now he is without the<br/>\nbasics he needs to follow that path later on.  Now understand-my husband is<br/>\nan engineer and knew he wanted to be an engineer pretty early on in his high<br/>\nschool years.  I, on the other hand, have been a retail manager, a teacher,<br/>\na graphic artist, and now a massage therapist and reiki practitioner-and I<br/>\nstill haven&#39;t *decided* what I want to be when I grow up!!!!  In most cases,<br/>\nreminding him of that I have repackaged my own career(s) as the interests<br/>\nstrike me, and that I had no medical/science basics when I decided on this<br/>\nlast career-and yet here I am!-has helped him understand that life and goals<br/>\ndo not look a certain way.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: ???&#39;s, how to develop faith about unschooling math....","postDate":"1200924428","msgId":28942,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1Mzk1MEFBQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":28941,"nextInTopic":28944,"prevInTime":28941,"nextInTime":28943,"topicId":28906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Exactly - it s about strewing things that are interesting in and of themselves, not strewing subjects .

They&#39;re trapped  <br/>\nusing methods that make real learning very difficult but allow them  <br/>\nto show learning happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In fact, it seems from all the math phobia, that what schools teach  <br/>\nkids best is that math is hard and boring and something to be  <br/>\navoided. And by avoiding math in real life, they miss out on  <br/>\nopportunities to understand how numbers work.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: ???&#39;s, how to develop faith about unschooling math....","postDate":"1200802938","msgId":28932,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZtdWk5cStsMnBxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZtcWlnMStuaDNlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28927,"nextInTopic":28941,"prevInTime":28931,"nextInTime":28933,"topicId":28906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One of the issues of Unschooling Voices (the unschooling blog carnival) was on unschooling math.

I am like a poster-child to show that we probably will all learn the kind of math we need or want when we find that we need or want it. That totally played out in my life. And the math I do know sure didn&#39;t come from school, just the fear of it.  So I am not tempted to think that my kids need formal lessons.  However, I am having trouble with strewing their path with math.  Like Tina says below, my kids can smell anything meant to teach them immediately, and of course I don&#39;t even want to sneak anything by them.  So if I suggest any games (like those from Pam Sorooshian&#39;s site) they refuse immediately.  And I honor their right to refuse, and it just passes on.  But they really never even let me show them any of it.  I guess my question is....it&#39;s my perception that with this situation, the right thing to do is let it drop, figuring that if and when they need this knowlege they&#39;ll search it out.  OK, that&#39;s great.  As<br/>\n long as I am not letting them down by failing to figure out how to gracefully strew their path. That&#39;s part of what I thought Tina was asking...how hard do you try to strew a path when they aren&#39;t looking at the path?  Isn&#39;t the answer that we must let them look where THEY are looking? I hope this was clear!  Thanks....

It has just made my fears hit more close to home. <br/>\nIt&#39;s <br/>\nnot that I am trying to relax from a curriculum I have imposed (we <br/>\nhave <br/>\nnot used any), it&#39;s that I feel so confused and unsure trying to sort <br/>\nout the whole math thing in my mind that I feel I haven&#39;t done near <br/>\nas <br/>\nmuch as I could in helping my kids discover the patterns, <br/>\nrelationships, games, etc that so many unschoolers say math is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am in the process of reading Math Power by Patricia Kenschaft after <br/>\nhearing Pam Sooroshian talk about it on tape. It has been great in <br/>\nshowing me about the &quot;language&quot; of math, incorporating it in real <br/>\nlife, <br/>\netc, and doing this seems so &quot;easy&quot; with ds as he has recently become <br/>\nvery interested in counting everything, the clock, obviously DELIGHTS <br/>\nin numbers/quantity and how it can change, all that sort of stuff, <br/>\nand <br/>\ndue to reading this book I feel more able to &quot;facilitate&quot; an explore <br/>\nthis with him. It feels &quot;natural&quot; to point it out to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith dd however I feel like I missed that boat in a way as (ok, I <br/>\nknow <br/>\nit is a schooly comparison but it is for puroposes of illustration <br/>\nfor <br/>\nyou all) she would maybe have a kindy-gr 1 level of understanding in <br/>\nmath, I know it is just from talking about what we see in everyday <br/>\nlife, cooking, reading a book, she knows &quot;intuitively&quot; somehow what <br/>\nis <br/>\nbigger, which thing is 3rd in line, etc and that has all &quot;gelled&quot; <br/>\nover <br/>\na period of the last few years, but I guess I have nothing &quot;ongoing&quot; <br/>\nat <br/>\nthe moment to show me how unschooling math &quot;works&quot;, or how she can <br/>\nget <br/>\nfarther along in it. With reading for example, I can see how all the <br/>\nplaying Starfall she was attracted to and being read to and fiddling <br/>\nwith alphabet letters <br/>\non the fridge and CONSTANTLY asking what things say has led to her <br/>\nreading, and the same now slowly with writing and spelling, because <br/>\nshe &quot;needs&quot; them to for the things she wants to do (write on her <br/>\npictures, do a comic strip and such) My faith in her reading without <br/>\nlessons developed at the same time I could see reading happening, one <br/>\nfeeding off the other y&#39;know?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is all because dd is &quot;school age&quot; now. I also have a <br/>\nhard <br/>\ntime not fretting about the arithmetic/4 basic operations aspect of <br/>\nmath. Yes I know dd ps&#39;ed peers play with blocks and rods, etc BUT <br/>\nwith the agenda and learning objectives the teacher expects of them <br/>\nI <br/>\nremember drill and being expected to memorize and crying becuse I <br/>\ncould not understand the &quot;why&quot; of borrowing! Does a gr 2&#39;er need to <br/>\nmememorize addition facts or just understand what it is? I have in <br/>\nall <br/>\nmy reading online about unschooling math rarely seen the whole <br/>\ncompetency and speed at &quot;computing&quot; issue addressed, especially with <br/>\nolder unschoolers. I guess I am thinking does playing dice for YEARS <br/>\nteach you enough math to get by as an adult (the everday consumer <br/>\nmath, <br/>\nnot algebra or anything!) <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, you hear stories of unschoolers being shown what &quot;long division&quot; <br/>\nis at 13 because it just &quot;came up&quot; and then they &quot;get it&quot; without all <br/>\nthose years of school math drill, but does being shown it once or <br/>\ntwice <br/>\nlead to skill? Does it need to? I just remember all those years of <br/>\nbeing made to practice over and over again. Again this is something <br/>\nI have never <br/>\nseen addressed online by my fellow unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nDD can sense any sort of &quot;this is meant to teach you...&#39;this&#39; &quot; I <br/>\nthink. I have so many sites bookmarked, I have so many books like <br/>\nFamily Math for Young Children, Games for Math by Penny Kaye sitting <br/>\non <br/>\nthe shelf pretty much unused because I can&#39;t balance the just doing <br/>\nit <br/>\nwith her because it is &quot;neat&quot; and a fun game, with the fear that if <br/>\nshe <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t &quot;practice&quot; or do the &quot;dice game&quot; enough she won&#39;t &quot;have her <br/>\nfacts down&quot;. I see so many math things like computer games, <br/>\nworkbooks, <br/>\netc that are thinly disguised drill, like those dollar-store- books <br/>\nthat <br/>\nhave comparing numbers of 3 types of toys and drawing a circle graph <br/>\n(gr 2 curriculum in my province BTW), or adding 45+3 in picture <br/>\nform. <br/>\nMy dd would look at something like that and thing &quot;what the heck <br/>\nfor?&quot; <br/>\nIs that even relevant to a 7 yr old? LOL even a writing workbook <br/>\ngiven <br/>\nto her by my MIL turned her off, I didn&#39;t care and just let her go at <br/>\nit on blank paper and she learned to write, it&#39;s like she sees <br/>\nthe &quot;expectations&quot; of workbooks and the more structured stuff loud <br/>\nand <br/>\nclear.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere does introducing stuff fall into place in light of being an <br/>\nunschooler? What about strewing? I know bigger numbers have come up <br/>\nin our lives, do I get Cusinaire rods or something, not to do <br/>\nthe exercises &quot;everyday at the same time&quot; like my structured hs-ing <br/>\nfriends do but to <br/>\nhave as a resource around to show her place value or comparing 10 to <br/>\n100 say if it came up, just to &quot;have it there?&quot; OR would that be too <br/>\nmuch manipulation and expectation? I guess I am having a hard time <br/>\nhaving &quot;resources&quot; around without the fears and concerns she is <br/>\nnot &quot;using&quot; it if that makes any sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so long and so jumbled as I pour this out. I am so <br/>\nconfused in this area. I am looking for personal stories especially <br/>\nfrom you with older kids, and for a kick in the butt, and for <br/>\nsuggestion as to how to relax.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina, dp James, dd Stephanie (7) and ds Jonathan (4) here in Manitoba <br/>\nCanada<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] ???&#39;s, how to develop faith about unschooling math....","postDate":"1200708064","msgId":28914,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxRTY0NzE5LTFGNDEtNDEyQi1BMkZGLTMxNTI1OUJEQkQzMEBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZtcWlnMStuaDNlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZtcWlnMStuaDNlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28910,"nextInTopic":28920,"prevInTime":28913,"nextInTime":28915,"topicId":28906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... 13 years of drill doesn t lead many of schooled kids to skill.

Does a gr 2&#39;er need to<br/>\nmememorize addition facts or just understand what it is? I have in<br/>\nall my reading online about unschooling math rarely seen the whole<br/>\ncompetency and speed at &quot;computing&quot; issue addressed, especially with<br/>\nolder unschoolers.<br/>\n==========<br/>\nOthers may give their opinion of the importance of computing speed, <br/>\nbut if you look at how you do math in your own life, you may be able <br/>\nto answer your own question.  Your fear of math or fear of your <br/>\ndaughter learning math or both seems to be clouding your own <br/>\nobservation of how YOU use math now, today.  Do you have to have fast <br/>\ncomputing speed in anything you do?  What depth of understanding do <br/>\nYOU have about borrowing?  Does this knowledge or lack thereof affect <br/>\nyour daily life?  Does your daughter&#39;s knowledge of addition facts <br/>\naffect her daily life, today, at age 8?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn high school I worked at a fabric store.  Something was always on <br/>\nsale and invariably some little old lady would come in wanting fabric <br/>\nfor a quilt.  She would want an eighth of a yard of the lovely blue <br/>\ncalico for 4.99/yd at 30% off and a quarter yard of the chintz for <br/>\n3.49/yd at 25% percent off.  After cutting about five different types <br/>\nof fabric like this, she would remember at the last minute that she <br/>\nhad her frequent buyer card that would give her an extra 10% on the <br/>\nwhole lot.  I would have to do all this calculation without a <br/>\ncalculator, while the customer chatted with me and three others <br/>\nwaited in line.  I learned how to take percentages in school, but <br/>\nnothing could have prepared me for doing that job, short of doing <br/>\nit.  I quit my job at the fabric store when I went off to college.  <br/>\nIn college I decided to get a degree in math.  I did some pretty <br/>\nabstract stuff. Addition facts and my skills I had learned at the <br/>\nfabric store were useless.  When I got out of school and became an <br/>\nengineer, I used some pretty sophisticated math which still didn&#39;t <br/>\nrequire any addition facts, nor any facility at computing numbers <br/>\nquickly.  Fast computation was the computer&#39;s job, thank you very <br/>\nmuch.  When I left work to be home full time, I no longer needed the <br/>\nabstract/sophisticated stuff.   Much of it is long forgotten (Fancy <br/>\nnumerical analysis is somehow lost on that laundry. LOL )  Recently I <br/>\nhave been cooking a lot.  I just got a cook book from Australia which <br/>\nhas metric measurements.  I&#39;m learning to do conversions again, <br/>\nsomething I haven&#39;t done since high school.  Throughout my life, I <br/>\nhave always learned and used the math I needed at the time.  The <br/>\ndrilling preparation in school really wasn&#39;t useful for me.  The <br/>\nfabric store was definitely the biggest example of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.that&#39;s why I suggest asking yourself how you have learned and <br/>\nused math in your own life.  If you can remember back when you were <br/>\nyour daughter&#39;s age, besides the drilling in school, what kind of <br/>\nmath did you use?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, by the way, if you are thinking that I&#39;m just one of those lucky <br/>\nones who just `got&#39; math.  I was put in a remedial math group in <br/>\nsecond grade.

They seem to go along<br/>\nwith your questions, perhaps we can come up with some answers together. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe more I embrace the idea of my kids just *living*, as opposed to them<br/>\nconstantly learning, the easier the whole thing becomes for me.  I think the<br/>\nunschooling community talks about natural math in order to illustrate what<br/>\n*can* be learned naturally (which is everything!), instead of it being a<br/>\nchecklist of things that your child *should* be learning naturally.  If you<br/>\ndaughter doesn&#39;t care about measuring cooking ingredients in order to pick<br/>\nup fractions and volumes and such, so what?  If there comes a time in her<br/>\nlife when she needs to know those things in order to do something she wants<br/>\nto do, she&#39;ll learn it.  If she doesn&#39;t ever need it, why should she know<br/>\nabout it?  I imagine there are oodles of math concepts which I know nothing<br/>\nabout, but it doesn&#39;t hinder my life currently.  If it ever came up, I&#39;d<br/>\nlearn the new stuff I needed to know.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as drilling and memorization, again, if someone finds that they would<br/>\nlike to have faster access to number results than they currently do, they<br/>\ncan easily find ways to speed their thinking.  But why make those<br/>\ncalcuations quickly if you don&#39;t need to?  I memorized the times tables as a<br/>\nkid (ugh!!!) but I often do not remember what a certain answer is for a<br/>\nmultiplication question in real life.  Certainly I understand what<br/>\nmultiplication is and how it works, so it&#39;s quick work to figure out what I<br/>\nneed to know.  If I had an activity (job, hobby, etc.) that used<br/>\nmultiplication often, I&#39;d likely put some effort toward speeding up my<br/>\ncalculating skills.  No difficulty there, no stress or feeling bad that I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do it before.  Just something new to figure out.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also want to cut yourself some slack on the differing interest in<br/>\nnumbers between your son and daughter.  Some people love numbers and working<br/>\nthem, some don&#39;t.  Something very funny just happened with my kids (while I<br/>\nwas typing this!) that illustrates this perfectly.  They are playing a game<br/>\non the Xbox, and on that system many games have &quot;achievements&quot; which you can<br/>\nearn for doing certain parts of the game in certain ways.  My older son (8.5<br/>\nyears) adores this and finds it very important to play just the right way in<br/>\norder to unlock the achievements.  My 4.5yo son doesn&#39;t care at all, doesn&#39;t<br/>\neven really understand what it&#39;s all about.  So they are playing together<br/>\nright now, and screaming at each other about what characters to play.  Turns<br/>\nout the 8.5yo wanted to unlock an achievement for the 4.5yo, and was being<br/>\nvery insistent about doing the game a certain way.  I pointed out to him<br/>\nthat not everyone is interested in the same things, and what is of paramount<br/>\nimportance to him might be meangingless for someone else.  He was stunned.<br/>\nWe don&#39;t all want the same things?  Wow, that&#39;s hard to grasp.  I think we<br/>\nall fall into that trap of thinking on occaision. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTo make it all more complicated, when you are required to report a child&#39;s<br/>\nlearning to an authority figure this becomes more stressful than it really<br/>\nneeds to be.  That&#39;s where the fear based thinking comes up, and we start<br/>\npushing for our kids to live in ways that are easily documented and<br/>\nconvenient for other people.  But life isn&#39;t like that.  It&#39;s like when my<br/>\nkids were babies and I breastfed them to sleep.  This drove my mom crazy<br/>\nbecause when they stayed with her for a few hours, she found putting them<br/>\ndown for a nap (which she felt they needed at a certain time) was very<br/>\ndifficult, since they were accustomed to nursing to sleep.  She made a big<br/>\nargument for why I should teach them to fall asleep on their own, trying to<br/>\nmake it sound like it was for the child&#39;s benefit.  When really it was for<br/>\n*her* convenience!  I made that clear to her, and she eventually got the<br/>\nidea.  I think reporting our children&#39;s learning is very much like this.  If<br/>\nthey would just do seatwork in a planned way, it was make the reporting so<br/>\nmuch easier!  But that&#39;s for someone else&#39;s convenience, not for my child&#39;s<br/>\nbenefit.  So I figure out the little subject chart as best I can, making it<br/>\na game for myself.  But I work very hard on my own thinking so that I won&#39;t<br/>\nforce my kids into something &quot;educational&quot; so that I can write it on the<br/>\nchart.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy lord, I&#39;ve written a novel here!  But hopefully this will open more ideas<br/>\nfrom everyone on how we think about all of this and how to calm down about<br/>\nit!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShell<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Tina Bragdon<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 18, 2008 8:01 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] ???&#39;s, how to develop faith about unschooling<br/>\nmath....<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHi, I am asking these questions as I know many of you have older <br/>\nchildren than mine and the benefit of time and experience, and also <br/>\nasking them in light of &quot;strewing&quot; and if it is manipulative, about <br/>\nteaching vs being a facilitator, and of having faith that unschooling <br/>\nwill be &quot;enough&quot; if that makes any sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am having a hard time overcoming my math fears and trying to relax <br/>\nabout it, especially now that dd is of mandatory school age in my <br/>\nprovince and I have to submit progress reports (no actual &quot;evidence&quot;) <br/>\ntwice a year.

It has been great in <br/>\nshowing me about the &quot;language&quot; of math, incorporating it in real <br/>\nlife, <br/>\netc, and doing this seems so &quot;easy&quot; with ds as he has recently become <br/>\nvery interested in counting everything, the clock, obviously DELIGHTS <br/>\nin numbers/quantity and how it can change, all that sort of stuff, <br/>\nand <br/>\ndue to reading this book I feel more able to &quot;facilitate&quot; an explore <br/>\nthis with him. It feels &quot;natural&quot; to point it out to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith dd however I feel like I missed that boat in a way as (ok, I <br/>\nknow <br/>\nit is a schooly comparison but it is for puroposes of illustration <br/>\nfor <br/>\nyou all) she would maybe have a kindy-gr 1 level of understanding in <br/>\nmath, I know it is just from talking about what we see in everyday <br/>\nlife, cooking, reading a book, she knows &quot;intuitively&quot; somehow what <br/>\nis <br/>\nbigger, which thing is 3rd in line, etc and that has all &quot;gelled&quot; <br/>\nover <br/>\na period of the last few years, but I guess I have nothing &quot;ongoing&quot; <br/>\nat <br/>\nthe moment to show me how unschooling math &quot;works&quot;, or how she can <br/>\nget <br/>\nfarther along in it. With reading for example, I can see how all the <br/>\nplaying Starfall she was attracted to and being read to and fiddling <br/>\nwith alphabet letters <br/>\non the fridge and CONSTANTLY asking what things say has led to her <br/>\nreading, and the same now slowly with writing and spelling, because <br/>\nshe &quot;needs&quot; them to for the things she wants to do (write on her <br/>\npictures, do a comic strip and such) My faith in her reading without <br/>\nlessons developed at the same time I could see reading happening, one <br/>\nfeeding off the other y&#39;know?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is all because dd is &quot;school age&quot; now. I also have a <br/>\nhard <br/>\ntime not fretting about the arithmetic/4 basic operations aspect of <br/>\nmath.

Does it need to? I just remember all those years of <br/>\nbeing made to practice over and over again.

I see so many math things like computer games, <br/>\nworkbooks, <br/>\netc that are thinly disguised drill, like those dollar-store-books <br/>\nthat <br/>\nhave comparing numbers of 3 types of toys and drawing a circle graph <br/>\n(gr 2 curriculum in my province BTW), or adding 45+3 in picture <br/>\nform. <br/>\nMy dd would look at something like that and thing &quot;what the heck <br/>\nfor?&quot; <br/>\nIs that even relevant to a 7 yr old?

I see so many math things like computer games, <br/>\nworkbooks, <br/>\netc that are thinly disguised drill, like those dollar-store-books <br/>\nthat <br/>\nhave comparing numbers of 3 types of toys and drawing a circle graph <br/>\n(gr 2 curriculum in my province BTW), or adding 45+3 in picture <br/>\nform.  <br/>\nMy dd would look at something like that and thing &quot;what the heck <br/>\nfor?&quot;  <br/>\nIs that even relevant to a 7 yr old? LOL even a writing workbook <br/>\ngiven <br/>\nto her by my MIL turned her off, I didn&#39;t care and just let her go at <br/>\nit on blank paper and she learned to write, it&#39;s like she sees <br/>\nthe &quot;expectations&quot; of workbooks and the more structured stuff loud <br/>\nand <br/>\nclear.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere does introducing stuff fall into place in light of being an <br/>\nunschooler?  What about strewing?  I know bigger numbers have come up <br/>\nin our lives, do I get Cusinaire rods or something, not to do <br/>\nthe exercises &quot;everyday at the same time&quot; like my structured hs-ing <br/>\nfriends do but to <br/>\nhave as a resource around to show her place value or comparing 10 to <br/>\n100 say if it came up, just to &quot;have it there?&quot;  OR would that be too <br/>\nmuch manipulation and expectation?  I guess I am having a hard time <br/>\nhaving &quot;resources&quot; around without the fears and concerns she is <br/>\nnot &quot;using&quot; it if that makes any sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so long and so jumbled as I pour this out.  I am so <br/>\nconfused in this area.  I am looking for personal stories especially <br/>\nfrom you with older kids, and for a kick in the butt, and for <br/>\nsuggestion as to how to relax.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina, dp James, dd Stephanie (7) and ds Jonathan (4) here in Manitoba <br/>\nCanada</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28945,"nextTopicId":28985}}
