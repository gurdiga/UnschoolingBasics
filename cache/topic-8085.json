It&#39;s not the curriculum, it&#39;s <br/>\nthe words like &quot;nasty&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; they are picking up from peers.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s that my son (5 yr old) when I ask what he did today, instead <br/>\ngives me a &quot;police report&quot; on who got their clip pulled and who did <br/>\nwhat to whom.  That isn&#39;t fun, and it certainly isn&#39;t what I want <br/>\nhim concentrating on!  So I&#39;ve decided to withdraw them both (don&#39;t <br/>\nreally need full time care anymore anyway!) and try home schooling, <br/>\nwith emphasis on unschooling.  My 5 yr old reads well, so I figure <br/>\nwe&#39;ll start with some library excursions and see where it leads us.  <br/>\nThis is all new to me and I have a doubting husband in the wings.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t picture myself as a &quot;school at home&quot; type person, so <br/>\nunschooling is very appealling to my spirit.  We&#39;ll see if it works <br/>\nfor my boys!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have read through a few of the posts and am wowed by how open and <br/>\nhelpful everyone is.  I hope that I can offer some tokens along the <br/>\nway in recompense!<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to getting to know you.<br/>\nPamela <br/>\nin Memphis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8239,"nextTopicId":8263}}
