We live  <br/>\ntwo blocks from a five lane road and four blocks in every other  <br/>\ndirection from five lane, 40 mph traffic (mostly college kids late  <br/>\nfor class, so think 50 mph)<br/>\nI told him that crossing those roads weren&#39;t an option for a while,  <br/>\nbecause *I* was not comfortable with it (he was nearly run down  <br/>\nwalking home from school once, because he honestly didn&#39;t think to  <br/>\nstop when a car was coming...and then froze when they honked instead  <br/>\nof running as they expected)  But he has a cell phone specifically  <br/>\nfor those purposes, and I have had to pick him up. He has had to  <br/>\nknock on someone&#39;s door to ask for directions because he had no idea  <br/>\nwhere he was and I didn&#39;t recognize the cross streets (in our own one  <br/>\nmile section!) But he survived and learned. I survived and learned.  <br/>\nThe funniest thing was that he found a ditch that went under the  <br/>\nroad, and when he came home an hour late, was wet up to the knees. I  <br/>\nwas very concerned, and he grinned and said, &quot;Remember how you said I  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t cross any major roads? You didn&#39;t say anything about going  <br/>\nUNDER them!&quot; So that was our concession. He still gets lost walking  <br/>\nto his friend who lives over there, and that&#39;s part of his brain as  <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaivety is something that they share, and I had to let go of my fear.  <br/>\nEven if someone did something that *I* perceived as advantageous  <br/>\n(poor video trades, Josh spending all of his money to buy food for  <br/>\nthose kids etc), he had to do it. He had to realize that 1) those  <br/>\nkids were using him and 2) that doing it left him with less cash and  <br/>\nnot more friends.  We talked about that too, with me being supportive  <br/>\nand offering ideas on what to do and what to say (&quot;Sorry guys, I&#39;m  <br/>\nsaving this for x,y,z&quot; or just not take more than two dollars, or  <br/>\njust be happy buying for someone else) It also meant that I went out  <br/>\nand built up relationships with all of those other parents (hard for  <br/>\nme), so we could say to the kids or the parents, &quot;You know, Josh is  <br/>\nreally regretting trading this game for that.

He may leave the yard to defy<br/>\nyou and prove you wrong.  Many of the spectrum kids I know will rely<br/>\non fact.  &quot;If I leave the yard, play safely, and return safely, then I<br/>\nhave proven that she was wrong and I was right.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that I don&#39;t know your situation or feelings on the matter, I<br/>\nwould do one of two things.

And I say we were between houses, but really we were just on the<br/>\nstreet, on the go, and only sometimes in someone&#39;s house or yard.  There was<br/>\na steak restaurant on the boulevard a few blocks from home that had a<br/>\nsoft-serve vanilla ice cream dispenser for patrons.  The manager would let<br/>\nmy bicycle gang (about 6-10 of us, usually, age 8-11 or so) get cones for 10<br/>\ncents, and we&#39;d do that a couple times a day.  We&#39;d have contests to see who<br/>\ncould make their cone tallest without it falling off.  I can still taste<br/>\nthat ice cream. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe made ramps to jump our bicycles over garbage cans and curbs and whatever<br/>\nelse we could find.  We&#39;d beg for scrap lumber at a nearby lumber yard to<br/>\nbuild our ramps and clubhouses and treehouses (or steal, a few times, if it<br/>\nwas Sunday and we needed wood...but one time we told them about it and they<br/>\nsaid it was OK...it was only scraps).  We let Jimmy hang out with us (even<br/>\nthough he was pretty mean sometimes) only because his dad had subscriptions<br/>\nto several nudie magazines and would drop them in the trash where Jimmy<br/>\ncould grab them.  Jimmy had a stack about a foot tall hidden in his bedroom,<br/>\nand we&#39;d take a few to the clubhouse sometimes but Jimmy usually preferred<br/>\nthey stay indoors.  We had about 4 different clubhouses, one of them in the<br/>\nfield next to my house.  I&#39;d usually go home for lunch, but not always.  And<br/>\nsome days I&#39;d be in and out of the house several times, retrieving ball<br/>\ngloves or other gear, or getting a band-aid.  But mostly I&#39;d just be gone,<br/>\nplaying, and get home around dusk.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy free ranging summers are among my fondest memories of childhood.  After<br/>\nage 11, we moved around a lot and there was only one other summer when I had<br/>\na bicycle gang to hang with.  It saddens me that my 3 y/o DS isn&#39;t likely to<br/>\nhave similar experiences...or not as many of them, at least.  With everyone<br/>\nworried about injury liability and predators and related adult crap/fears,<br/>\nroaming days are mostly history except in the small towns like where you<br/>\nlive.  Enjoy it!  When I see bicycles in my neighborhood these days, it<br/>\nappears to be a family &quot;going for a ride&quot;.  My parents had bicycles, and<br/>\nwe&#39;d all &quot;go for a ride&quot; as a family sometimes on a Sunday, but that was a<br/>\ndifferent thing altogether from the true intended purpose of MY bicycle,<br/>\nwhich was a ticket to Freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have zero experience/opinion about how autism would factor into<br/>\nthis...just wanted to reminisce about my own free range years.  <br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBrad in Boulder, CO</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa Gray","from":"Melissa Gray &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Free range children","postDate":"1210777955","msgId":32820,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZEQjM3QUU3LUEzOEItNEFBMC1CMTQ2LUVBMTAyQkNEMTZCQkBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGcwZWNkOCtiYmFlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGcwZWNkOCtiYmFlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32819,"nextInTopic":32821,"prevInTime":32819,"nextInTime":32821,"topicId":32819,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, being in a similar situation with Josh, I ll share what we did to make both of us happy.

Funny, although I grew up like this, I actually<br/>\n&gt; found this quite shocking! On the plus side, our yard has been<br/>\n&gt; regularly full of kids who often stop in to play with my son for a<br/>\n&gt; while. The friendships my son has made in the safety of his backyard<br/>\n&gt; have been the best he&#39;s made to date and he&#39;s very excited about his<br/>\n&gt; new popularity.

My son is 8<br/>\n1/2 and on the autism spectrum.  Coming from a big city, we were quite<br/>\nsurprised to find that many kids here wander from house to house,<br/>\nunsupervised, playing in the houses or yards of other kids that they<br/>\npick up as they go.  Funny, although I grew up like this, I actually<br/>\nfound this quite shocking!  On the plus side, our yard has been<br/>\nregularly full of kids who often stop in to play with my son for a<br/>\nwhile. The friendships my son has made in the safety of his backyard<br/>\nhave been the best he&#39;s made to date and he&#39;s very excited about his<br/>\nnew popularity.  He is feeling a confidence in himself that is brand<br/>\nnew to him and that he is very proud of.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet I knew it had to happen - my son now wants to &quot;roam&quot;  with the<br/>\npack.  Besides me not being okay with this in principle, I also know<br/>\nthat he still relies heavily on my constant availability to help him<br/>\ndeal with situations that are out of his comfort zone.  I think he has<br/>\nforgotten that he still does this, as he feels like &quot;them&quot; when<br/>\neveryone is playing in our yard.  Yet now he says  he wants to try<br/>\n&quot;going out on his own&quot; so he can &quot;make his own mistakes&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can see he is really growing and starting to feel like he belongs<br/>\nfor the first time in his life and his enthusiasm is absolutely<br/>\nwonderful to see.  Yet only two days ago he told me he was terrorized<br/>\nby his friend&#39;s 3 year old little brother that was bullying him<br/>\n(pulled his hair), while he was on a playdate at his friend&#39;s house<br/>\nand he spent the last half hour there hiding in the back yard until I<br/>\npicked him up, while his friend played video games in the house.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI can talk to him about many things, but he does not want to hear<br/>\nanything but &quot;be free&quot; when it comes to the subject of his new<br/>\nfriends. I suspect he is going to slip out of the yard one of these<br/>\ndays to test his new confidence in himself... Any suggestions as to<br/>\nhow I can prevent myself from having a major coronary when I can&#39;t<br/>\nfind him would be most welcome.  And perhaps a better approach to<br/>\ndiscussing why &quot;roaming&quot; is not appropriate at his age when everyone<br/>\nelse is apparently doing it and are all fine (besides fear-based ideas).  <br/>\n<br/>\nPat</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32741,"nextTopicId":32848}}
