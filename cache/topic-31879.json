Nothing makes<br/>\nme feel worse then doing something  stupid to make my sons cry, just because<br/>\nI was stressed.  Thankfully they have really short memories, even is we<br/>\ndon&#39;t.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy wife also travels some for work.  The stress really builds because I<br/>\ndon&#39;t get any down time.  I have since learned that I really really REALLY<br/>\nneeded to find a way to release that stress when she is gone.  Part of my<br/>\nproblem too, was just adjusting to being home and not working.  I was a<br/>\nworkaholic in my former life.<br/>\n <br/>\nStill have trouble believing how things turned out, but I love being home.<br/>\nMy youngest took his first steps today without support. I got to see that<br/>\nand be home for it.  How cool it that!! Okay sorry I digress ;)<br/>\n <br/>\nI saw a list like this a while back in one of my wifes parenting magizines<br/>\nshe reads and it really helped me. Of course the list was geared towards<br/>\nstay at home moms and not practical for me so I have developed my own list.<br/>\nThese are a few things that I do to release some stress<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope this helps you some or gives you some ideas.  Hang in there.<br/>\n <br/>\n1) I get a time out and we watch Star Trek.<br/>\n <br/>\n2) My sister comes for a visit<br/>\n <br/>\n3) I play Guitar Hero and they all dance while I play<br/>\n <br/>\n4) Video game really really help me calm down, so after the kids go to bed I<br/>\ndo this first, before doing any work. I will be doing dishes tomorrow anyway<br/>\nso its not like they are going there. I am sort of a reformed neat freak.<br/>\nFind something that relaxes you.<br/>\n <br/>\n5) I once wrote a LONG love letter to my wife and emailed it to her while<br/>\nshe was on travel.  It was like we were dating all over again and she got a<br/>\nbig kick out of it.<br/>\n <br/>\n6) Watch a Laurie Berkin DVD. Some of the songs have motions or we made some<br/>\nup.  We will just dance around and sing.  This is great for bad weather.<br/>\n <br/>\n7) We go to the park and I play some basketball while they ride their toys<br/>\naround the court. Exercise always helps reduce the stress, but its hard to<br/>\ndo when I am by myself.<br/>\n <br/>\n8) I go move into my mom&#39;s house for a bit sometimes.  I know my friend<br/>\nhighly recommends this as its the way she copes with having her husband<br/>\ngone.<br/>\n <br/>\n9) I get some babysitting if nothing else. I trade with another stay at home<br/>\nmom. We both get desperate to get out.  I also have a retired friend from<br/>\nchurch who is like a third grandma to my kids who comes over for a few<br/>\nhours.  Then I usually hit the coffee shop or Barnes and Nobles for a couple<br/>\nof hours.<br/>\n <br/>\n10) We have a movie night.  We have been watching  My Neighbor Totoro and<br/>\neating some special snacks.<br/>\n <br/>\nHang in there Chrissy<br/>\n <br/>\nCheers<br/>\nChad<br/>\n <br/>\nOn Mon, Apr 14, 2008 at 10:32 PM, Chrissy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrissymomto2@...\">chrissymomto2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   How do you do it??? Today I took the award for horrible mom. Just<br/>\n&gt; when I was feeling like ok this listening... being mindful, honoring<br/>\n&gt; of my children was becoming natural to me as opposed to being<br/>\n&gt; something I had to think about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not that they whys excuse the actions but Im stressed to the hilt...<br/>\n&gt; we are going on the 4th week of hubby working out of state. Im very<br/>\n&gt; lucky to have a very involved hands on kinda husband so being alone<br/>\n&gt; is a shocker too me. The kids have been awesome, I was a bit afraid<br/>\n&gt; of the woo hoo moms all by herself lets mess with her head but its<br/>\n&gt; been the exact opposite. Today though I had a total meltdown. Larry<br/>\n&gt; had come home sat for the weekend and was less than stellar IMO, the<br/>\n&gt; kids were edgy and sensing his and I&#39;s stress over him leaving again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jacob who is 8 had hugged me at least 20 times finally the 21st time<br/>\n&gt; I snapped, I was trying to get something finished that larry needed<br/>\n&gt; to leave, and instead of taking the nano second to hug Jacob, I put<br/>\n&gt; up my hand to push him away.... that in and of itself is bad enough<br/>\n&gt; but when he started crying I Yelled I just dont want to hug you right<br/>\n&gt; now.......<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; UGGGGHHHHHH I have cried off and on all day. He of course is over<br/>\n&gt; for the most part although since then when he walks up to hug me he<br/>\n&gt; has been asking feel like a hug? I have said im sorry to the point<br/>\n&gt; where he bluntly told me Im annoying him with it.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know it just happened today so its very fresh but HOW could I do<br/>\n&gt; this???? Sorry I guess this is more of a ramble post!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chrissy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!
