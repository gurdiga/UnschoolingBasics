The lodge (with bunk beds) has been reserved for staying over. There are also camp sites available. (More information at the website.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you sign up at the website you&#39;ll receive updates by mail.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allinmay2012.blogspot.com\">http://allinmay2012.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Sandra and Meredith are taking requests for what you&#39;d like to hear :-) (Such a deal!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than a conference with loads of speakers and kid activities to choose from -- for which there is the really awesome Northeast Unschooling Conference each August!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/\">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-- the symposium is small and focused primarily on talks and discussion. The main speaker is Sandra Dodd with the other speakers drawn from her Always Learning list, thus Always Learning Live :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeakers are:<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd<br/>\nMeredith Novak<br/>\nBrie Jontry<br/>\nJoyce Fetteroll<br/>\n<br/>\nDo note that the camp is right next to a lake -- but no one will be allowed to swim in it! (The lifeguards would be prohibitively expensive unfortunately.) So if you think it would be torture for your kids (or you or your spouse! :-) to be that close to water and not be able to go in, the Northeast Unschooling Conference would be much more fun for you :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48078,"nextTopicId":48109}}
