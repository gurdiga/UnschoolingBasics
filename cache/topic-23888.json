It&#39;s what  <br/>\n(seemingly) everyone who has decent kids does. But conventional  <br/>\nparenting also turns out criminals and keeps therapists and self-help  <br/>\nwriters in business. So it feels like parenting is a crap shoot and  <br/>\nyou do the best you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny that when conventional parents claim their kids are loving  <br/>\nand kind and so forth, and then dig deep to explain what they&#39;re  <br/>\ndoing with their kids beyond the punishment, it always turns out that  <br/>\nin addition to conventional parenting, they&#39;re connecting and bonding  <br/>\nwith their kids through dialog, actually listening to their kids  <br/>\nrather than talking at them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the relationship that&#39;s allowing conventional parenting to work,  <br/>\nnot the conventional parenting itself. Because if it was conventional  <br/>\nparenting that worked it would always turn out great kids. But it  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just skip the conventional parenting and go for the part that  <br/>\nworks! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nParents can do better than a crap shoot by applying the principles  <br/>\nthat help humans thrive: love, trust, respect, partnership.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost parents would claim they do that. But in conventional parenting  <br/>\nthose principles are far down the list of what&#39;s important. The  <br/>\nunderlying principle of conventional parenting is getting the child  <br/>\nto behave in ways the parents feel is acceptable to create kids who  <br/>\nare happy, healthy and thoughtful. Parents may employ what feels to  <br/>\nthe parent like love and respect in their molding but the goal is  <br/>\nimproving the child&#39;s behavior, getting the child to think in the  <br/>\nright way: stop the raging, stop the tantrums, do their chores, clean  <br/>\nup after themselves, say please and thank you, close the door, come  <br/>\nhome on time and so on and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we applied the goals and techniques of conventional parenting to  <br/>\nany other relationship we wouldn&#39;t have relationships at all!  <br/>\nConventional parenting is so disrespectful of children, that it&#39;s a  <br/>\ntestament to the parent child bond that it ever works at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the foundation of conventional parenting is the idea: &quot;I know a  <br/>\nbetter way for you to be and I&#39;m going to employ various techniques  <br/>\nuntil you catch on.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the foundation of mindful parenting is the idea: &quot;I know you&#39;re  <br/>\ndoing the best you can. Let&#39;s see if we can figure out together an  <br/>\neven better way to get what you want.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKids don&#39;t want to rage. They don&#39;t want to hit each other. But they  <br/>\ndo want to get their needs met. And mindful  parenting focuses on  <br/>\nbeing the child&#39;s partner in finding a better way to meet their needs  <br/>\nwithout stepping on other&#39;s toes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMindful parenting is about assuming that kids don&#39;t want to do wrong  <br/>\nthings.  Mindful parents assume kids want to be kind and thoughtful  <br/>\nbut just don&#39;t have the knowledge, skills or understanding to do so  <br/>\nalways. We help them, and trust that they&#39;re doing the best they can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was not clear, and you, and others, misunderstood.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>On this list we need to be as crystal clear as we possibly can about  <br/>\nwhat part of what we&#39;re doing is working. &quot;This works for us,&quot; isn&#39;t  <br/>\ngood enough.

But if the parent decides for the child that they will clean it<br/>\nup because it&#39;s THEIR mess, then it does become punishment. And<br/>\npunishing other human beings isn&#39;t mindful in my book. It&#39;s coercion<br/>\nand not at all gentle.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is some information on mindfulness: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.parentcoachinginstitute.com/articles/normand_MindfulParenting.html\">http://www.parentcoachinginstitute.com/articles/normand_MindfulParenting.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMindfulness has such meaning, but most of all it means being fully<br/>\npresent in the moment. When I am fully present for my child, there is<br/>\nno judgement of who deserves to clean up a mess or placing blame on<br/>\nanyone or anything. When I am fully present, I can simply be in the<br/>\nmoment, noticing both my feelings and the situation. I can choose<br/>\nactions more clearly in that place of being fully present.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we see our children as human beings doing the very best they can<br/>\nin each and every moment, it frees us to be their partners without<br/>\njudgement, without guilt or blame or punishment of any kind. Thats a<br/>\ngood place to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly, whose mess it is no longer matters at all and one can act<br/>\nwith compassion.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Doing something right","postDate":"1179887115","msgId":23936,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYzMDhtYityM2ZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYzMDZwMCs3NDU4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23935,"nextInTopic":23937,"prevInTime":23935,"nextInTime":23937,"topicId":23888,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~Once again, I must point out that since my children are thriving and happy and learning, I must be doing something right.~~ If that s as far as a person","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-919894911\">~~Once again, I must point out that since my children are thriving<br/>\nand happy and learning, I must be doing something right.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s as far as a person wants to take it, then they might not be<br/>\ncomfortable with deeper examination.

That is why I offer, from my own experience, what <br/>\nhas worked for me.  It&#39;s just an option for someone to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nViewing a mess that someone makes as his/hers to clean up does not <br/>\nfall outside the borders of gentle, mindful parenting.  I never said <br/>\nyou had to be ugly about it, like some of the sample quotes <br/>\nindicated.  You just start early with picking up toys with your child <br/>\nand grow into an understanding that my mess is mine to clean up and <br/>\nyour mess is yours.  But that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t help each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Telling a child, &quot;You made the mess, YOU clean it up!&quot; isn&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>meeting the child Where He Is Right Now, nor is it understanding that <br/>\nhe needs MORE tools, not fewer.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;No child *wants* to be angry and frustrated: he *wants* to be calm <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and happy. When he&#39;s not (due to things beyond his immediate <br/>\ncontrol), he may lash out. Punishing him by making him &quot;Clean that <br/>\nmess up!&quot; will not be the best way to get him to a calm and happy <br/>\nstate. He didn&#39;t *want* to be angry and destructive, he just had no <br/>\nother tools.&lt;&lt; <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course children do not want to feel angry and distressed.  And <br/>\nmany adults don&#39;t even have tools to handle it, so why would anyone <br/>\nexpect a child to?<br/>\n<br/>\nI never said or intimated that a child be *required* to clean up a <br/>\nmess they made while they are still in the midst of an emotional <br/>\nstorm. Nor should they be told (because it&#39;s ugly), &quot;You know you&#39;re <br/>\ngoing to have to clean that up later.  It&#39;s your mess, you have to <br/>\nclean it up.&quot;  That, as you pointed out, would only exacerbate the <br/>\nanger.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not indicate that a child should be punished at all for an <br/>\noutburst of anger.  I said that no one else should clean up his <br/>\nmess.  I never even said that he should be *told* to clean up the <br/>\nmess because he made it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Punishing him for the lack of tools will only make him <br/>\n </span></blockquote>disrespectful and resentful ...and probably angrier.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree.  That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t mention punishing the child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;My goal is to help him learn how to handle anger.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mine, too!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Making him angrier doesn&#39;t do that.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sometimes there comes a point when anything you do or don&#39;t do makes <br/>\nthe child angrier.  By handling your own intense emotions in a <br/>\nproductive way, you are role modeling a tool the child can learn.  <br/>\nGoing into another room, when my daughter is raging and even looking <br/>\nat me makes her scream more, is productive.  It gets at least one <br/>\nsource of frustration out of her way for a while.  It isn&#39;t <br/>\nabandonment.  She knows I&#39;m there.  She knows she&#39;s welcome if she <br/>\nwants me, or that I will go right to her if she calls.  If the <br/>\nseparation becomes irrelevant, or causes further distress, of course <br/>\nI respond to her need for support.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd every time she gets through something like that we don&#39;t have <br/>\na &quot;you-shouldn&#39;t-act-like-that&quot; talk.  I just ask, &quot;Do you feel <br/>\nbetter?&quot; and &quot;Do you want something to eat?&quot; and take cues from her <br/>\nabout what to talk about from that point.  Usually she ends up asking <br/>\nquestions (that I&#39;ve answered a thousand times) about hypoglycemia <br/>\nand managing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Helping him clean up the mess he made while talking about how <br/>\n </span></blockquote>frustrating it can be to be eight or twelve or 39 *can*. &lt;g&gt; &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I can also use that time to let him know how much I love him even <br/>\n </span></blockquote>when he&#39;s so angry, and we can talk about what&#39;s making him angry and <br/>\nabout other ways to deal with his anger.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I certainly agree that assisting him to clean up the mess shows <br/>\ngrace, and love and provides an excellant opportunity for <br/>\nconstructive conversation.  I&#39;ve done that many times.  But it&#39;s <br/>\nstill not my mess to clean up, I help because I have love for my <br/>\nchild.  Many times my son would quietly clean up the mess without <br/>\neven letting me know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Although your advice would be accepted on a mainstream, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>conventional parenting e-list, I *do* find your &quot;advice&quot; out of line <br/>\nwith the goals of this list.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that some assumptions were made about me and my parenting that <br/>\nare not true.  Perhaps, in trying to keep my post to a reasonable <br/>\nlength I left too many questions open about how we do things around <br/>\nhere.  I would welcome the opportunity to clarify anything I post, if <br/>\nneeded, rather than endure being told publicly that my parenting is <br/>\nnot appropriate, when it is appropriate and effective.

So I&#39;ll just share:  <br/>\n<br/>\n1) I have three 15yo boys that live around me, one of which is mine.  Each one began having rages around the ages of 10-12 and lasting until ages 13-15.  With each of them, hormonal shifts were the initiating cause; but each case was exacerbated by situational difficulties such as a father not being present in the home, diagnosed psychological problems, or fighting parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see a boy going through these ages but having no situational circumstances but having extreme rages if he has never experienced a lot of anger, so he doesn&#39;t know what to do with it.  Or there can even be secondary circumstances that are not clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, if hormones are the initial cause all you can do is keep on providing a good role model, talk calmly to him if you have to at all during one of those rages, and wait until he gets older.  Also, if he destroys something during a rage, no one should fix it or clean it up but him. That&#39;s not punishment or coercion, it&#39;s life - you are responsible to clean up your own messes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2) My 11yo daughter and I have difficulties with hypoglycemia.  If we do not eat every 3-4 hours, the blood sugar drops WAY down and one of the symptoms of hypoglycemia is irritability - only with my daughter it shows as unreasonable displays of anger and rage.  Even when she knows her blood sugar is low, she will, in a rage, refuse to eat anything that will help her (as in NOT candy), as well as throw things, scream and cry, etc.; she&#39;s totally unreasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution here is reminding her to eat in a timely manner, and offering her something with a sugar, protein combination when she starts getting cranky.  If she gets to the rage stage, we remove the audience by sending her to her room, or going where she&#39;s not present, and letting her get it out of her system.  Eventually she knuckles under to what her body is trying to tell her and will get something to eat.<br/>\n <br/>\n~~ When the first baby laughed for the first time, <br/>\nthe laugh broke into thousands of pieces <br/>\nand they all went skipping about, <br/>\nand that was the beginning of fairies ~ Peter Pan ~~<br/>\nCheck out my website at www.KellyLee.info  and my favorite photos at www.KellyLee.info/photos<br/>\nYours Truly,       <br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________Pinpoint customers who are looking for what you sell. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com/\">http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Raging kids without violent households","postDate":"1179837914","msgId":23891,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0M0IxNDY0LUNCMDYtNDFGOC04NjY0LUJDQTBBNTAxNTM0NkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYyc29tZCs0Z2pqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGYyc29tZCs0Z2pqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23890,"nextInTopic":23895,"prevInTime":23890,"nextInTime":23892,"topicId":23888,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
