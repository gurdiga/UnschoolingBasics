I agree<br/>\nDisney has some of the worst offenders. We watched a movie yesterday that<br/>\nwas rated PG (unusual for us) called Mad Hot Ballroom, and it was wonderful.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a documentary about a ballroom competition held in NYC for public<br/>\nschool 5th graders.

A parent ALWAYS dies or leaves in order to create dramatic tension in<br/>\n&gt; their live action movies. In their animated stuff the violence and intensity<br/>\n&gt; can really go over the top. My kids still haven&#39;t seen Bambi. Neither one<br/>\n&gt; wanted amovie that leads up to the beloved mother dying.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s why it&#39;s a good idea to examine movies and shows as they come up. The<br/>\n&gt; name Disney or an animated presentation does not guarantee a happy movie. In<br/>\n&gt; that same vein, an adult theme or monster premise is not automatically too<br/>\n&gt; intense in every situation. It depends on the child, the situation, the<br/>\n&gt; parents, and the movie. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12517,"nextTopicId":12378}}
