I have twin daughters who are 17.  When we decided to get them <br/>\na phone we checked and compared prices and found the best price for us <br/>\nas a family was through Cingular.  We have to pay 69.99 for the main <br/>\nphone and then 10.00 for each phone after that so we pay 125.00 a month <br/>\nfor 4 phones once you add in taxes, etc.  We share 1500 minutes between <br/>\nus but we have free mobile-to-mobile, free long distance, free nights <br/>\n(9:00 pm-6:am) & weekends so it is worth it for us to always be in <br/>\ncontact with one another.  One of my daughter&#39;s has a boyfriend who just <br/>\ntransferred to California...we are in FL and due to the time differences <br/>\nfrom there to here she talks to him after 9:00 every evening and they <br/>\ncan talk for hours and there is no charge.  When we get our bill in the <br/>\nmail we have 15-17 pages of phone numbers dialed to and from all of our <br/>\nphones but we NEVER use all the minutes since we are calling other cell <br/>\nphones within Cingular&#39;s plan or each other or during free times.  The <br/>\n$125.00 may sound like a lot but for us it has been a lifesaver since we <br/>\nall have our own phone now and can be reached at any time of day or <br/>\nnight.  Our home phone bill ran 50.00-60.00 a month easily and there was <br/>\n&quot;arguing&quot; over who needed to use the phone, not answering call-waiting <br/>\ncalls, having to wait around the house for a call, etc.  My 9-yr-old <br/>\nkeeps asking when he is going to get a phone!! LOL, I told him as soon <br/>\nas he was a teenager and started doing stuff away from us (he is ALWAYS <br/>\nwith us!)<br/>\nElisa<br/>\n<br/>\nSandrewmama wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Aug 19, 2005, at 7:58 AM, soggyboysmom wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; With the current inexpensive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cell phones and pay as you go plans (no big commitments), it might<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be well worth it to both help him maintain the friendship AND have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; safety outlet.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My 14 yo will be flying alone, in a week, to NYC (we live in the <br/>\n&gt; midwest) to explore the city for four days with his Nana & Grappa.  <br/>\n&gt; Nana & Grappa have a cell phone but only turn it on when they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; expecting someone might call them (ie. they told me they&#39;ll have it <br/>\n&gt; on during my son&#39;s travel time).

This can be taken in many <br/>\ndirections.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m getting to the point that I just detest public school.  It makes <br/>\nmy stomach go in knots when I hear about children having to be <br/>\nlocked up in a room, some without windows, all day long.  It&#39;s part <br/>\nof society.  It&#39;s what we are raised to do.  Unless something <br/>\nhappens to change our minds and our circumstances that is the <br/>\nlifestyle we lead.  It&#39;s the same with spanking.  It&#39;s the same with <br/>\nimmunizations.  It&#39;s the same with food choices.  It&#39;s the same with <br/>\neverything we do that effects our lives and the lives of our <br/>\nfamilies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of are not blessed to know kind and gentle parenting before <br/>\nwe&#39;ve had our babies.  Some of us have to arrive there.  Some of us <br/>\nnever will.  I&#39;d have to say that I know way more people that <br/>\nparent &quot;main stream&quot; than embrace the unschool philosophy.  Even for <br/>\nthose of us that come to unschooling it&#39;s the unschooling in <br/>\nrelation to everything school that comes first.  The parenting is <br/>\nmore of a biproduct of the choice to unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that we are in a vast society filled with many different <br/>\ntypes of people and belief systems.  I believe one benefit of <br/>\nunschooling is that we learn how to co-exist and interact with all <br/>\ndifferent types of people.  We are not self-limiting in who we can <br/>\nassociate with.  It is very possible that someone who believes in <br/>\nspanking may disagree with our decision to unschool and find it <br/>\nequally reprehensible that we are willing to &quot;damage&quot; our children <br/>\nin such a way.  We do what we know to be good and true at whatever <br/>\npoint we are at.  We can only do what we know.  Period.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince when have we needed to worry about whether someone that <br/>\nbelieves in spanking (no matter how they believe in it) is going to <br/>\nbe a physical threat to our children, especially at the age of 14 <br/>\nyears?  Most people that believe in spanking don&#39;t even spank <br/>\nchildren of that age.  Also, it is very unusual for anyone who <br/>\nspanks their children to spank anyone else&#39;s children without prior <br/>\npermission.  In my personal opinion this seems to be a bit of an <br/>\nover reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this is just my personal opinion on this type of situation.  <br/>\nIt is not directed at anyone in particular.  Just my opinion on the <br/>\nsubject at hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92643757,"authorName":"Leslie530@aol.com","from":"Leslie530@...","profile":"lescather","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] spanking","postDate":"1124461913","msgId":6109,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNmLjJmMzRmZDMyLjMwMzc0NzU5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6108,"nextInTopic":6110,"prevInTime":6108,"nextInTime":6110,"topicId":6080,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I meant  the boy who is visiting his friend does not have anything to worry about  himself.

It outrages him.  <br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you scared and riled him about this mom and now he&#39;s thinking of ways<br/>\nhe can fight back?  That probably wasn&#39;t the kindest thing you could have<br/>\ndone for him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people hit their kids.  Lots.  Your doctor might have hit her<br/>\nkids, your vet, your letter carrier.  You just don&#39;t know and if you&#39;re<br/>\ngoing to declare war on everyone who has or is your son&#39;s world will be<br/>\ngetting smaller instead of bigger. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did you feel you had to tell him about his friends mom?   To warn him<br/>\nin case something happened at their house?   Are you going to warn him<br/>\nagainst the possibility that at any friends house or at any moment in<br/>\npublic he might witness a child/parent interaction that&#39;s less than<br/>\nideal?   Creating fear and suspicion in him won&#39;t help him have<br/>\nfriendships.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***He does feel that their friendship will be limited if he doesn&#39;t go<br/>\nover though.***<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, he wants to go.  But now he&#39;ll go, looking for a reason to be angry<br/>\nat that mom, with the possibility of tension between him and his friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I guess you didn&#39;t read the posts very thoroughly. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I read was that from an e-mail conversation you found out this mom<br/>\nis like millions of moms out there who spank their kids, and yes, even<br/>\nuse a stick.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve written many times about spanking and I believe even one open handed<br/>\nswat on the behind is assault.  I believe this because if I hit any adult<br/>\nthat way they could press charges against me.   My son was never spanked<br/>\nor punished in any way and like you I believe hitting another person,<br/>\nespecially our own kids, is abuse. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut from what you read about her spanking you&#39;ve concluded she&#39;s a raging<br/>\nout of control lunatic who might go off at any minute and beat her<br/>\nchildren in front of your son and maybe even beat your kid too.   I think<br/>\nthat&#39;s unlikely. <br/>\n<br/>\n***Deb, what would you say about all of this if <br/>\nthese people had admitted that they fondle their children, but we had<br/>\nnever seen <br/>\nit happen.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThey didn&#39;t.  She admitted to a legal and widely accepted practice that<br/>\nour society is so comfortable with they call it &quot;parenting.&quot;   Equating<br/>\nher bad choice/ignorance to spank with deviancy is not going to help you<br/>\nthink about this rationally.  Creating a wild scenario is not a good<br/>\npractice and won&#39;t do anything to help your son maintain this friendship.<br/>\n That is your goal, right?  Typically parents who hit their kids do not<br/>\ndo so under the watchful eye of house guests and do not randomly hit<br/>\nhouse guests/other people&#39;s children.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I can tell you for sure that being concerned for his safety will not <br/>\nbe as traumatizing ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t write that being concerned for his safety would traumatize him. <br/>\nI said being a barrier to this friends could.  Being a barrier to his<br/>\nexploration of the world and his own good judgement could.   You are<br/>\ntrying to protect him from your fear, not from any situation that has<br/>\nactually happened to or is likely to happen to your son.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSince you live so far from the other kid is part of the reason his mom<br/>\nisn&#39;t letting him come to your house that she has little kids and can&#39;t<br/>\ngive her older kid a ride?  Have you offered to go pick him up?  Maybe<br/>\nthat will help. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if you just drove over there with your son and said, &quot;Can Bobby<br/>\ncome with us to the music store?&quot; or some such she&#39;d be less rigid, face<br/>\nto face.  Take her a pie.   Have the whole family over for dinner or game<br/>\nnight.   Bridge the gap that was created out of your e-mail discussion if<br/>\nyou can.

I<br/>\nhave a great example of this in my own life with regard to religious.  I<br/>\ngrew up in a very conservative Christian rural area.  I was always<br/>\ninterested in religion and church.  My mother was not conservative at<br/>\nall, but was very supportive of me finding my own way.  I lived on a<br/>\nranch about 20 miles from the nearest small town.  Every so often a<br/>\nchurch bus would drive out to pick me up and take me to the church I was<br/>\nmost curious about at the moment.  I was proselytized by every church in<br/>\nthe area.  Our public school would even let kids out of school to go to<br/>\nthe Baptist tent revival!  My mom would just share her views, but not<br/>\nmake a big deal out of my exploring.  I think because she was so willing<br/>\nto let me explore that I turned out having a very healthy view of<br/>\nspirituality and am now comfortable in my views and spiritual practice.<br/>\nAs a matter of fact, I finally landed on a religion that my mother<br/>\nintroduced me to when I was about 17 years old.

If <br/>\nthese parents were pedophiles no one would think my son should be in their <br/>\nhome just because he&#39;s big enough to fight back.  To me physical abuse is <br/>\nsomething as horrible as sexual abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs always, our children  are going to interact with<br/>\npeople who think and act differently than we do,  and<br/>\nit is through discussing this with them and helping<br/>\nthem to understand  and process what they see and hear<br/>\nand do that they will form their own view  of the<br/>\nworld.  So, lots of discussions with him, and then at<br/>\n14 I  think he is old enough to decide whether or not<br/>\nhe wants to hang out at their  home.<br/>\n<br/>\nEthan interacts with people that have very different beliefs than he does.  <br/>\nEven in our own family (myself and youngest son are vegetarians and he is not <br/>\n:), he is so much more of an environmentalist than I am--things that I don&#39;t <br/>\nfind objectionable he does, we have friends that run the gammet from Christians <br/>\nto Pagans, friends who are main stream and others who are environmentalist and <br/>\nback to the earth types,etc, etc.)  We have had many discussions.

She gives great advise to those  that <br/>\nare dealing with these sometimes conflicting ideas.<br/>\n <br/>\nHere are her thoughts....<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nWell the thing is, even if it is morally reprehensible<br/>\nto many of us,  spanking, even with a switch or &quot;rod&quot;,<br/>\nisn&#39;t illegal in *any* state, and  doesn&#39;t fall under<br/>\nthe legal category of abuse.  It is even still  legal<br/>\nin 22 states for school officials (principals,<br/>\nteachers, etc.) to  paddle students.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, I used to spank my kids, and  now<br/>\nfirmly believe that spanking is useless as a form of<br/>\ndiscipline and is  totally wrong, and it was<br/>\ndiscussions on unschooling.com and other  unschooling<br/>\nlists that helped me see it for what it was...a sorry<br/>\nattempt  to make my children conform to my needs of the<br/>\nmoment or to assuage my own  embarrassment at their<br/>\n&quot;unacceptable&quot; behavior, and need for approval  from<br/>\nother parents that I was &quot;training&quot; my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly don&#39;t  think she needs to worry about the<br/>\nsafety of her 14yo.  A 14yo should be  able to<br/>\nunderstand that if he witnesses something that makes<br/>\nhim  uncomfortable in their home, he can come home and<br/>\ntalk to his mother or  father about it.  He should also<br/>\nunderstand that if anyone ever tried to  harm him<br/>\nphysically, he is legally allowed to defend himself,<br/>\nso I  wouldn&#39;t worry about those people spanking him!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs always, our children  are going to interact with<br/>\npeople who think and act differently than we do,  and<br/>\nit is through discussing this with them and helping<br/>\nthem to understand  and process what they see and hear<br/>\nand do that they will form their own view  of the<br/>\nworld.  So, lots of discussions with him, and then at<br/>\n14 I  think he is old enough to decide whether or not<br/>\nhe wants to hang out at their  home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196090915,"authorName":"jnjstau@direcway.com","from":"jnjstau@...","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] parenting question","postDate":"1124391383","msgId":6087,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwMTZkYzUxMDE3YTY0LjEwMTdhNjQxMDE2ZGM1QGRpcmVjd2F5LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":6084,"nextInTopic":6088,"prevInTime":6086,"nextInTime":6088,"topicId":6080,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would talk with my 14yo about my concerns, any concerns they might have, how things are handled, etc., then I would let my 14yo make up their own mind.

I have a question for you. <br/>\nLike you and Chick, I do not believe in spanking either. But many of my<br/>\nother Christian friends keep telling me about &quot;sparing the rod and<br/>\nspoiling the child.&quot; Surely God doesn&#39;t want us to hit our children,<br/>\ndoes He? I believe in a God of love. What do you make of all this? <br/>\nThanks in advance, <br/>\nBeth Jerry <br/>\nSaginaw, MI<br/>\nDear Beth, Lori, Unsigned, and others, <br/>\nAs you know, in our last parenting newsletter, Chick and I shared our<br/>\nbeliefs on spanking in the article, &quot;This Is Going to Hurt Me More Than<br/>\nIt Is Going to Hurt You.&quot; In it, we challenged the readers to examine a<br/>\nwidely accepted view of spanking from a different perspective. We<br/>\nchallenged conventional wisdom and asked parents to consider how hitting<br/>\nchildren as a form of discipline may actually be hurting the parent in<br/>\nways they were previously unaware of. <br/>\nWe greatly appreciate your willingness to share your comments with us as<br/>\nyou examine your own parenting style and are challenged by different<br/>\nviews on raising responsible, caring, confident children. While it is<br/>\nnot our desire to tell you how to parent your children, we do want to<br/>\nprovide readers with techniques and strategies for raising children with<br/>\ngrace, integrity, and love. <br/>\nSince you asked, my personal thoughts about the Biblical issue follow. <br/>\nAs an ordained minister I spent 8 years learning the Hebrew and Greek<br/>\nlanguage so as to study the Bible in its original language. Since that<br/>\ntime, almost 20 years ago, I have spent many laboring hours preparing<br/>\nsermons and writing Bible studies on topics of marriage, love, money,<br/>\nmiracles, gifts of the Spirit, parenting, and most importantly the Grace<br/>\nof God as seen through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It was with<br/>\ngreat respect for the scriptures that I undertook a call to raise the<br/>\nconsciousness of parents throughout the world. It is with this same<br/>\nrespect and conviction that I offer a look at a Biblical perspective on<br/>\nspanking. <br/>\nChristian parents frequently seek the Bible in their effort to raise<br/>\ngodly children. They believe that there is a biblical mandate to spank<br/>\nand they fear that if they don&#39;t spank, they will commit the sin of<br/>\nlosing control of their child. They believe that God has commended them<br/>\nto spank and they take &quot;spare the rod and spoil the child&quot; literally. In<br/>\ndoing so they misunderstand the concept of the rod. The following are<br/>\nthe biblical verses which have caused the greatest confusion: <br/>\n&quot;He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to<br/>\ndiscipline him.&quot; (Proverbs 13:24) <br/>\n&quot;Folly is bound up in the heart of a child. But the rod of discipline<br/>\nwill drive it far from him.&quot; (Proverbs 22:15) <br/>\n&quot;Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish him with the rod<br/>\nhe will not die. Punish him with the rod and save his soul from death.&quot;<br/>\n(Proverbs 23:13-14) <br/>\n&quot;The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to itself<br/>\ndisgraces his mother.&quot; (Proverbs 29:15) <br/>\nAt first glance these verses seem to be in strong support of the use of<br/>\ncorporal punishment. But are they really? A closer examination of the<br/>\nHebrew word for &quot;rod&quot; (shebet) sheds more light on the subject. In the<br/>\nHebrew dictionary &quot;rod&quot; has various meanings: a stick for walking,<br/>\nwriting, fighting, ruling, and punishment. The word &quot;shebet&quot; is most<br/>\nfrequently used when referring to shepherds who are tending their<br/>\nflocks. The shepherds used the stick to fight off predators and to<br/>\ngently guide wandering sheep, not strike them for being out of line. <br/>\nThe verses that contain this material were written in poetic form.<br/>\nWriters of poetry typically use familiar words of the day to represent<br/>\nconcepts and create imagery of what they are writing about. The &quot;rod&quot;<br/>\ncan as easily be interpreted as a gentle guide as it can a stick for<br/>\nhitting children. <br/>\nThe image that I believe we are to extract from these verses in Proverbs<br/>\nis one of creating a culture of accountability in our families. The<br/>\npoint that God is making here is that we as parents are to hold our<br/>\nchildren accountable for their choices and actions. That is His desire. <br/>\nThere are many ways to hold a child accountable, and corporal punishment<br/>\n(spanking) does not have to be one of them. <br/>\nReread the passages above and replace the references to punishment and<br/>\nthe use of the rod with the word &quot;accountability&quot; and notice what<br/>\nhappens. <br/>\nFor example: <br/>\nProverbs 13:24 would read, &quot;He who spares accountability hates his son,<br/>\nbut he who loves him is careful to discipline him.&quot; <br/>\nProverbs 22:15 would read, &quot;Folly is bound up in the heart of a child.<br/>\nBut holding him accountable will drive it far from him.&quot; <br/>\nProverbs 23:13-14 would read, &quot;Do not withhold discipline from a child;<br/>\nif you create a culture of accountability he will not die. Create<br/>\naccountability and save his soul from death.&quot; <br/>\nProverbs 29:15 would read, &quot;The culture of accountability imparts<br/>\nwisdom, but a child left to itself disgraces his mother.&quot; <br/>\nAs Christians, we believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God.<br/>\nYet some Christians hold fast to interpreting the &quot;rod&quot; in the Proverbs<br/>\npassages as a mandate to spank. They interpret the passages written many<br/>\nyears ago in the language of the time with today&#39;s words and context.<br/>\nThey take the passages literally, staunchly claiming that that&#39;s what<br/>\nthe Bible says. <br/>\nBut what about these passages? <br/>\n&quot;Anyone who attacks his father or his mother must be put to death.&quot;<br/>\n(Exodus 21:15) <br/>\n&quot;If anyone curses his father or mother, he must be put to death. He has<br/>\ncursed his father or his mother, and his blood will be on his own head.&quot;<br/>\n(Leviticus 20:9) <br/>\nAlmost every parent would admit that their child has said, &quot;I hate you,&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;You&#39;re not the boss of me,&quot; at one time or another. But no one<br/>\nargues that their child should be put to death in these cases. <br/>\nNo, children don&#39;t need to be put to death and they don&#39;t need to be<br/>\nspanked either. They do need to be held accountable for their actions<br/>\nand choices, however. The Bible simply does not support spanking. It<br/>\nsupports holding children accountable. It says, &quot;Train a child in the<br/>\nway he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.&quot;<br/>\n(Proverbs 22:6) &quot;Training&quot; does not mean spanking, hitting, or any other<br/>\nform of corporal punishment. <br/>\nChick and I believe that creating a culture of accountability is the<br/>\nmost loving thing you can do for your children. We believe in holding<br/>\nchildren accountable within a model that Jesus gave us. In the New<br/>\nTestament Jesus modified the Old Testament by providing us with a model<br/>\nof gentleness and love. He changed the eye-for-an-eye approach and<br/>\ncalled for turning the other cheek and forgiving seven times seventy. <br/>\nConsider these inspired words of God in your parenting: <br/>\n&quot;Fathers do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the<br/>\ntraining and instruction of the Lord.&quot; (Ephesians 6:4) <br/>\n&quot;Fathers do not embitter your children, or they will become<br/>\ndiscouraged.&quot; (Colossians 3:21) <br/>\n&quot;What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a whip, or in love with a<br/>\ngentle spirit?&quot; (Corinthians 4:21). <br/>\nBecome an enlightened parent, one who is moved and inspired by the word<br/>\nof God that calls for grace, gentleness, forgiveness, and love in all<br/>\nthat you do. Challenge yourself to create a Christ-like approach to<br/>\nparenting. Seek strategies and techniques that enable you to parent to<br/>\nthe soul of your child. <br/>\nRefrain from using the Bible as an excuse to spank. Use it instead to<br/>\nhelp you create a higher vision of yourself as a parent and to become<br/>\nthe parent you always wanted to be. <br/>\nWarmest regards, <br/>\nThomas Haller <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196291069,"authorName":"Daniel MacIntyre","from":"Daniel MacIntyre &lt;daniel.macintyre@...&gt;","profile":"macintyred","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] parenting question","postDate":"1124375772","msgId":6083,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxMmNiNDRlMDUwODE4MDczNjI4ZTdlNDUxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFmYi5lZWQ5YTc0LjMwMzVlZTk2QGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDFmYi5lZWQ5YTc0LjMwMzVlZTk2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6082,"nextInTopic":6084,"prevInTime":6082,"nextInTime":6084,"topicId":6080,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Proverbs 13:24 He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to discipline him. and Proverbs 23:13-14 Withhold not correction from a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-857681935\">Proverbs 13:24 &quot;He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves<br/>\nhim is careful to discipline him.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nand<br/>\n<br/>\nProverbs 23:13-14 &quot;Withhold not correction from a child: for if thou<br/>\nstrike him with the rod, he shall not die.

My oldest son (now 24) had a good friend in h.s. and went to his house to play alot until.............. I found the dad was not just having a beer after work but driving home drunk and drinking more when he got home.  I also found out he kept a loaded shot gun next to his bed.  Well you can bet the moment I found these well kept &quot;secrets&quot; my son wasnt allowed over there anymore.  His friend was welcome at my home anytime day or night.    Once I explained the safety reasons to my son he understood and made a point of having him over here more.   <br/>\nAbout a month later his friend came over and said guess what &quot;mom&quot; ? my dad isnt drinking at home anymore.  Well the thing that got me was &quot;at home&quot;  which led me to believe he was still drinking somewhere else.  But all in all, my sons safety came first & I did what I could to give his friend a safe haven to escape to.  <br/>\nI dont blame you for putting your childs safety first and foremost.  Hopefully the other family will see there are other ways of dealing with issues.

A couple of months ago on another homeschool <br/>\n  list the issue of spankings came up (needless to say it&#39;s not an <br/>\n  unschooling group)and from these post I found out the mother of my <br/>\n  fourteen year old&#39;s friend does indeed spank and even has used sticks <br/>\n  on her children.  She believes the bible gives her this right. You <br/>\n  know the whole spare the rod spoil the child philosphy to justify <br/>\n  child abuse.  We kind of got into it because that totally goes <br/>\n  against anything I believe in and I&#39;m really scared for these <br/>\n  children.  I tried to reason nicely with her and others that have <br/>\n  this philosphy, but they aren&#39;t reasonable when they feel it&#39;s their <br/>\n  God given duty to beat their children.  I, also, pointed out using a <br/>\n  stick on the child is considered child abuse by the State.  This <br/>\n  person turned around and now says that she doesn&#39;t even spank her <br/>\n  children.  I think I scared her--not my intent. Now I think she&#39;ll <br/>\n  hide it and the children might even be more abused.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  My child and this other child are still friends.

A couple of months ago on another homeschool <br/>\nlist the issue of spankings came up (needless to say it&#39;s not an <br/>\nunschooling group)and from these post I found out the mother of my <br/>\nfourteen year old&#39;s friend does indeed spank and even has used sticks <br/>\non her children.  She believes the bible gives her this right. You <br/>\nknow the whole spare the rod spoil the child philosphy to justify <br/>\nchild abuse.  We kind of got into it because that totally goes <br/>\nagainst anything I believe in and I&#39;m really scared for these <br/>\nchildren.  I tried to reason nicely with her and others that have <br/>\nthis philosphy, but they aren&#39;t reasonable when they feel it&#39;s their <br/>\nGod given duty to beat their children.  I, also, pointed out using a <br/>\nstick on the child is considered child abuse by the State.  This <br/>\nperson turned around and now says that she doesn&#39;t even spank her <br/>\nchildren.  I think I scared her--not my intent. Now I think she&#39;ll <br/>\nhide it and the children might even be more abused.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy child and this other child are still friends.  I have tried to <br/>\nhave him over numerous times since the discussion, but they always <br/>\ndecline.  They have however invited my child over, but I&#39;m not <br/>\nfeeling too comfortable with this idea.  Am I being overprotective by <br/>\nonly wanting the child to come to my house?
