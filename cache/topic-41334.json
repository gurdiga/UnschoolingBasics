What I&#39;ve observed (totally<br/>\nunscientific) is that a big sound blast yell (a) requires lots of muscle<br/>\ninvolvement (b) requires a large intake of fresh oxygen all the way to<br/>\nthe bottom of the lungs (c) expels lots of CO2 - all of which contribute<br/>\nto a decrease in stress feelings and help clear the brain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also learned that the airplane guidelines regarding cabin pressure<br/>\napply to everyday &quot;pressures&quot; as well - make sure you put your own<br/>\n&quot;oxygen mask&quot; on first and then deal with the kids. For instance, I used<br/>\nto get really frustrated trying to get DS out the door for a morning<br/>\nevent (stuff where we had little control over the timing). It kept<br/>\nhappening over and over. So, I talked with DH about it first (to get<br/>\nsome feedback on what it &#39;looked like&#39;) and realized that I was trying<br/>\nto get DS moving before I had breakfast. Bad move. I backed things up a<br/>\nlittle, so that I had time to shower, dress, eat breakfast, and gather<br/>\nwhatever &#39;gear&#39; we needed before I even went to see if DS was awake.<br/>\nThen  I could calmly and completely focus on him and his needs instead<br/>\nof trying to get his clothing on him AND gathering stuff AND getting<br/>\nmyself dressed. It was the idea of a &#39;bottleneck&#39; that I gleaned from<br/>\nRaising Your Spirited Child.

Taking deep breaths helped, but for awhile I&#39;d have to take a deep breath somewhere about ten seconds into yelling - you know, that first time I&#39;d run out of air, I&#39;d take a deep breath and think &quot;this isn&#39;t what I want to be doing&quot; and then stop. And appologise and start over. <br/>\n<br/>\nA little further along my process I would start by yelling an &quot;I&quot; statement. Like &quot;I am sooooo frustrated right now!&quot; That helped shift the dynamic from me yelling At someone to me just yelling.

Something that helps is being sensitive to my own needs and moods.

I&#39;m Dee & I have 5 out of 8<br/>\nchildren at home right now. I took 3 out of 4 publicly schooled children out<br/>\nof school back in December &#39;04 (the 4th wanted to stay & he was happy & well<br/>\nadjusted, so I let him. He&#39;s just gone off to college this fall.) We are on<br/>\nCape Cod.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have done &quot;school at home&quot; with little success for most of this time.<br/>\nHowever, I did notice that they seemed to learn more when they were <br/>\nneglecting&quot; their assigned work. But I still hesitated on dropping it<br/>\nbecause of fear of what &quot;others&quot; would say. You know, &quot;they don&#39;t DO<br/>\nschool??&quot; *gasp*. Anyway, after much research & prayer, I really feel led to<br/>\nchange our lives in many areas, including dropping all formal curricula. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have read articles from Christian perspectives (we have been since &#39;06),<br/>\nboth pro and con, and am even more sure that this is the right path for us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI subscribed to this list a few days ago and have already learned quite a<br/>\nbit about general attitudes towards parenting (mostly positive!). I am<br/>\nworking diligently on my own temper. I am ashamed to say that I am a yeller.<br/>\nI let the little things get under my skin. But I&#39;ve read so many helpful<br/>\narticles (lots from Joyfully Rejoycing) that are helping me redefine my own<br/>\nattitude about housework & parenting in general. I do believe we need to <br/>\ntrain up our children&quot;, but more by modeling (aka discipleship) than by<br/>\nforce. If they see me working hard at cleaning things up, they MAY decide to<br/>\nhelp (which they have been, realizing that the less I have to do, the more<br/>\nfree time we have together) more. Much less stress than the old scheduled<br/>\nlists. But, I still get the occasional attack of &quot;OMG! Look at this mess!&quot;.<br/>\nGuess I&#39;m still learning, too. Now I apologize for any outbursts. The kids<br/>\nhave been great.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I went off track a bit there....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, at home I have Melissa (14), Sarah (13), Molly (almost 10 - Oct. 22)<br/>\n Michael (4) and Abigail (20 months). I also have a 21 year old (not at home<br/>\n no real contact - long story) son, 16 year old son (lives with Dad -<br/>\nanother long story) and my 18 year old son that just started college. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJustin (the 16 y.o.), Melissa & Sarah were the original 3 I took out of<br/>\nschool. Justin (at his Dad&#39;s) is back in P.S. Melissa tried (her request)<br/>\ngoing back last year for 7th grade. She lasted a month & wanted home again.<br/>\n:) Molly is my first to never be in a public school and God-willing she or<br/>\nthe others never will be again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for &quot;listening&quot; and I look forward to learning more from you all and<br/>\ngetting to know you better.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Dee<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDiary of a Mad Crafter <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41429,"nextTopicId":41464}}
