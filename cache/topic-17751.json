I feel more relaxed about the unschooling since I found this community. I belong to another homeschooling list, and I am finding that the unschoolers are more in line with my thinking. It helps to read this list because it is a constant reminder or shall we say affirmation that allowing my daughter time to &quot;deschool&quot; is the right thing to do. Sometimes it is difficult when I am not surrounded on a daily basis in real life with people who share my values on this, and have to deal with the parents of her schooled friends, the neighbors, family, etc. <br/>\nOne thing I did do was what someone else sugessted on this board: document in &quot;schooled terms&quot; everything she does that can be considered educational or schoolish, and I have a good list of documentation so if anyone pokes their nose into our business, I have stuff for show and tell. <br/>\nAs for Not Back To School Camp, she attended this past summer and had a WONDERFUL time!

I would suggest she or you read Grace Llewelyn&#39;s books - Teenage Liberation Handbook or Real Lives: 11 teenagers who don&#39;t go to school, etc. Better yet, just get the books from your library and leave them laying around so that she can pick them up if she wants to. I am 36 and I feel that it took me a solid 18 years to get over being institutionalized. It won&#39;t take her so long with all your love and support but remember that she IS an amazing person and she WILL find her way. Trust her and trust what she wants to do. We have a 19 year old young woman in our lives (she lives with us off and on) who was taken out of school when she was 11. She deschooled for about a year (thanks to her cool, cool mom) and in the last three years has (completely on her own initiative) gone to Not-back-to-school-camp in Oregon (also a Grace Llewelyn thing), spent 3 months working on an organic farm in Japan, worked lots of jobs - scraping money wherever possible, travelled with us<br/>\nand other friends taking care of small children, gone to a midwifery conference in Denmark then spent 5 months working on organic farms in Spain, learned to sew and to garden and to play the piano, read countless books, had a romantic relationship, worked this year at Not-back-to-school-camp as a cook, and many, many other things. And just let me say that she is not an exceptional person other than in the way that we all are if left to do as we should. Congratulations to your daughter and to you/your family for supporting her.

I feel that she <br/>\n&gt;would have been a fabulous unschooler, and should have been unschooled from <br/>\n&gt;the start, but I had reasons why I had to go to work full-time and could <br/>\n&gt;not stay home and unschool. Consequently, and sadly, she spent 9 years in <br/>\n&gt;school and I watched the life get sucked out of her until she just could <br/>\n&gt;not take it any more and voluntarily announced that she was not going to <br/>\n&gt;High School.<br/>\n&gt;My question is: How does one start unschooling a child who has had an <br/>\n&gt;institutionalized education and is turned off to anything that reeks of <br/>\n&gt;having to learn something? Does anyone else have a teenager that is new to <br/>\n&gt;unschooling? I am battling the family scrutiny (she isnt DOING anything!) <br/>\n&gt;and the parents of her friends (she will never go to college!). I really <br/>\n&gt;dont give a horses you-know-what about their opinions, I just need some <br/>\n&gt;suggestions about how to inspire my daughter. She is admittedly more <br/>\n&gt;relaxed these days, and I am not pushing her, but what does unschooling <br/>\n&gt;look like given this situation?<br/>\n&gt;Kathryn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________________<br/>\nFind a local pizza place, music store, museum and more�then map the best <br/>\nroute! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://local.live.com\">http://local.live.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Does anyone else have a teenager <br/>\nthat is new to unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a 14 yo daughter.  This is her 2nd year out of school <br/>\n(she left after 6th grade, she&#39;s at the older end of her class age <br/>\nrange).  I, too, wish I had found unschooling long ago, but I&#39;m at <br/>\nleast glad to have found it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI came across the word unschooling when researching homeschooling.  <br/>\nThe thing that helped me the most was to read (and I&#39;m STILL <br/>\nreading!) anything and everything I could get my hands on about <br/>\nunschooling, learning, forgetting, education, whatever called to <br/>\nme.  Actually, the first book I read that was like a slap upside the <br/>\nhead was &quot;Dumbing Us Down:  The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory <br/>\nLearning&quot; by John Taylor Gatto.   &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; by <br/>\nGrace Llewyllyn is good (my daughter won&#39;t read it, I&#39;ve talked <br/>\nabout it with her), another by the same author is &quot;Guerilla <br/>\nLearning:  How to give Your Kids a Read Education with or without <br/>\nschool&quot;.  Anything by John Holt.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is our 2nd year and even though I know this is the right path <br/>\nfor her, I still have my moments of doubt.   I can&#39;t offer as many <br/>\nwords of wisdom as well as so many of the seasoned unschoolers on <br/>\nthis list can, but I can share that there are others who pulled an <br/>\nolder child from school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has to deschool and heal (how long has she been out of <br/>\nschool?).   The general rule is to allow one month of down time for <br/>\nevery year your child was in school (and I included daycare, so <br/>\nthat&#39;s most of her life!).   This is not a hard and fast rule, it <br/>\nmight take less, it may take longer.   YOU have to deschool as well <br/>\n(I call it &quot;dework&quot; sometimes!  I always worked full time).  Give <br/>\nher lots of space.  My dd loves computer and video games.   She&#39;s on <br/>\nmost of the day (unless we have something planned).  Sometimes she <br/>\nwatches a favorite TV program.   She dislikes reading for pleasure.  <br/>\nHer typing and spelling has improved dramatically from playing her <br/>\nonline games.   She loves to draw.   She just started taking a dance <br/>\nclass after being inspired by a summer theater camp.  We&#39;re <br/>\nexploring places to take horseback riding lessons and working with <br/>\nthe animals, after going horseback riding this summer during a <br/>\ncamping trip.   She wants to do something with animals for her <br/>\nlife&#39;s work.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was getting frequent migraine headaches towards the end of her <br/>\nlast year in school.  She frequently was stressed and anxious.  She <br/>\ngave up because the teachers didn&#39;t understand how she learns and <br/>\nthinks (despite my attempts to educate *them* - they thought she <br/>\njust wasn&#39;t trying hard enough).   Now she gets as much sleep as she <br/>\nneeds and is much more relaxed and confident.  No migraines.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not expressing myself very well tonight.  If you&#39;re interested <br/>\nin reading some of the things I&#39;ve posted about as someone new to <br/>\nunschooling with a teenager, search the archives under my name <br/>\n(jlh44music).   There are others in a similar situation as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead.   Absorb.   Ask questions.  Expect that your concept of school <br/>\nand learning will be challenged and thrown out of wack.  Be open to <br/>\nnew ideas.  Stop trying to inspire her.  She needs time to find her <br/>\nown way.<br/>\nJann (who still says all these things to herself!

The fact that you say do nothing makes me feel more relaxed. She wanted to take a Digital Photography course so we enrolled in that at the Community College, but I am wondering if she is not mature enough for that yet. She is skipping tonight to hang out with friends. I just told her the decision was hers to go tonight or not but to remember that whatever she decided, it reflected on her.  I also took her to the bookstore last night at her request and she picked out a couple of books to read.  I guess I just need to relax. Its just hard sometimes to separate out the teenage issues from the deschooling issues and there is other stuff going on as well like we are in the middle of a move and her Dad is recovering from back surgery, so I cant quite quit my job yet.

Watch T.V., listen to her <br/>\n&gt; radio, talk on the phone, nd whatever else she might do during the day. You <br/>\n&gt; have to give her time to de-school. It may appear that she is doing nothing, <br/>\n&gt; but she is! When your home take her with you to the store or bank or <br/>\n&gt; whatever if she wants. If not, let her have some down time. I wouldn&#39;t do <br/>\n&gt; anything to her or for her as far as academics go unless she ask. Maybe get <br/>\n&gt; her few subscriptions to whatever magazines she likes if you want her <br/>\n&gt; reading. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the mean time, start reading up on unschooling, look at web sites, read <br/>\n&gt; the blogs, and stay on these type list. It will take a natural course. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wasn&#39;t &quot;Unschooled&quot; until my freshman year of highschool and I went to <br/>\n&gt; college. It was a waste of my time for the most part. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I started unschooling It didn&#39;t look like I was doing anything for <br/>\n&gt; almost a year, and even then it was slow. I had to learn a new thinking <br/>\n&gt; pattern and redefine my own image of education. My parents had tried to show <br/>\n&gt; me how to unschool, it was annoying. But when they showed me by example that <br/>\n&gt; they were still students of life, I learned to become a student of my own <br/>\n&gt; life. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope that helps! <br/>\n&gt; Wildflower <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:airokat@...\">airokat@...</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [unschoolingbasics] New and with a teenager <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 02 Oct 2006 21:45:04 +0000 <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hi, <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have a formerly conventionally schooled daughter aged 14.

My son is almost 14 (in 8th grade--sounds <br/>\nlike your daughter is in 9th), and this is his first year out of <br/>\nschool. We also are new to unschooling/homeschooling, and it was not <br/>\nsomething that we set out to do, as I and my husband both work full-<br/>\ntime.  Our son, like your daughter, is just not cut out for the <br/>\nstructure of schooling, and it took a crisis (major meltdown and <br/>\ndepression starting last spring) for us to realize that school was <br/>\nkilling him slowly.  We came to unschooling really because no other <br/>\noption seemed right for our son... but I was extremely reluctant... <br/>\nwondering what the family would think, wondering how I could <br/>\npossibly handle this with a full time job (but I work at home which <br/>\nhelps)... and not really feeling cut out for this AT ALL.  But to <br/>\nour son, unschooling sounded like salvation, and it just felt like <br/>\nthe right thing to do for him.  It&#39;s really hard on me I must admit, <br/>\nbut in a good way, and he is definitely a much happier person now... <br/>\nWe are still finding our way though, trying to rid ourselves of all <br/>\nof the &quot;shoulds&quot; that really can screw things up!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few things that have helped so far which I&#39;ll just share <br/>\nin case they may be helpful to you:<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;ve heard that does seem to be true is that when a kid <br/>\nstarts unschooling at a later age, it may take months <br/>\nof &quot;decompression&quot; until they can even begin to see what they&#39;d like <br/>\nto pursue.  So, your daughter probably needs time to just do nothing <br/>\nfor a while (or to do whatever she wants to do, even if it&#39;s to <br/>\nwatch TV all day). I don&#39;t think you can rush this (that&#39;s what I <br/>\nkeep having to remind myself of all day long). <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the relatives and friends, you can perhaps tell them (and <br/>\nyourself) that the mental health of your daughter is far more <br/>\nimportant than missing a few months of &quot;school&quot;.  In the larger <br/>\nscheme of things, taking a few months of her life to chill out from <br/>\nwhat was a very damaging experience, will not sentence her to a life <br/>\nof working in McDonald&#39;s... probably just the opposite.  We are just <br/>\nstarting too, and definitely do NOT have this figured out, but I can <br/>\nsay that I have seen my son come back to life, and that is far more <br/>\nwonderful to see than A&#39;s on a report card.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we decided to do this, I sent a long e-mail to all the family <br/>\nand friends to explain what homeschooling/unschooling was, I laid <br/>\nout all the reasons for doing it, all the plusses, as well as all <br/>\nthe concerns... and how great our son was doing as a result... and <br/>\nsomehow this seemed to not only appease everyone, but everyone was <br/>\ncheering us on!!  Even my father (and believe me, this is EXTREMELY <br/>\nout of character for him).  So, I only mention this because it might <br/>\nbe a way to address everyone&#39;s concerns all at once, and might even <br/>\nclarify your own thinking, and it might quiet them down a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast thing:  I was really afraid that my son would be isolated <br/>\nsocially, even more so than fearing that he wouldn&#39;t get the proper <br/>\nacademic education, so I really tried hard to find a couple of group <br/>\nactivities around his interests.  (We found a chess club and a <br/>\ncomputer animation group)  This was a great move---it made him feel <br/>\nlike there were others like him out there, and I met some like-<br/>\nminded parents who are helpful and supportive.  I&#39;ve had to make <br/>\nadjustments to my work schedule to accommodate getting him to these <br/>\nclasses, but it&#39;s worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to have gone on so long... I should add that we also have a 16-<br/>\nyr-old daughter in 11th grade in public school, and she&#39;s doing just <br/>\ngreat there.  She wouldn&#39;t consider unschooling if I paid her a <br/>\nmillion dollars... so, to each their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps....<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, airokat@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; I have a formerly conventionally schooled daughter aged 14.

She deschooled for about a year (thanks to her cool, cool mom) and in the last three years has (completely on her own initiative) gone to Not-back-to-school-camp in Oregon (also a Grace Llewelyn thing), spent 3 months working on an organic farm in Japan, worked lots of jobs - scraping money wherever possible, travelled with us<br/>\n and other friends taking care of small children, gone to a midwifery conference in Denmark then spent 5 months working on organic farms in Spain, learned to sew and to garden and to play the piano, read countless books, had a romantic relationship, worked this year at Not-back-to-school-camp as a cook, and many, many other things.  And just let me say that she is not an exceptional person other than in the way that we all are if left to do as we should.  Congratulations to your daughter and to you/your family for supporting her.  She has a strong inner voice that will serve her well I&#39;m sure!<br/>\n  Meadow<br/>\n  life learner with daughter Indigo (9), son Tashi (5), and lovely husband Kirk<br/>\n<br/>\nWildflower Car &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolfool@...\">unschoolfool@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  I think you should let her do what she wants.
