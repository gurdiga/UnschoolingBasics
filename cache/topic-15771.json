When I turn on my iPod after he has been listening<br/>\nto it, it&#39;s about four settings louder than I would listen to it.  (It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t blast my ears out, but it is noticeably louder than just<br/>\naudible.)  There have been recent articles that extended listening<br/>\ntime from an iPod or other in-the-ears device can cause hearing loss.<br/>\n (And some lawsuits against Apple, I think.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, 49, is already showing some amount of hearing loss that<br/>\nmay affect his ability to hold down a job (as a classroom teacher).<br/>\nHowever, his hearing lost is likely not from exposure to loud noise as<br/>\nhe has never worked at a noisy job and didn&#39;t go to concerts or own a<br/>\nstereo as a teen, or listen to loud music as an adult.  So like heart<br/>\ndisease, some disfunction may just be an inevitable byproduct of age,<br/>\nat least for some people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve discussed with my son (12) the possibility that listening to<br/>\nmoderately loud music for long periods can damage hearing.  What else<br/>\nshould I do?  More reseach to figure out more precisely the volume<br/>\nlevels that can cause trouble?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe may listen 3 plus hours a day, probably less than enough to cause<br/>\n&quot;overuse&quot; problems.  Music has mood-elevatng effects and he sings and<br/>\ndances when listening.  One can&#39;t say that the health effects of the<br/>\niPod are all negative, because of these positives.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I give too many reminders about volume, that&#39;s gonna backfire,<br/>\npossibly?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160045678,"authorName":"seccotine_ch","from":"&quot;seccotine_ch&quot; &lt;seccotine@...&gt;","profile":"seccotine_ch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: fear and food (cross post from AU)","postDate":"1152948506","msgId":15772,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5YTVlcStibnZmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU5OWgycit1YXBlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15771,"nextInTopic":15778,"prevInTime":15771,"nextInTime":15773,"topicId":15771,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That s really a great post !

Sometimes they forced me to taste, but I never had <br/>\nto finish my plate, and my father thought that a child always <br/>\ndeserved a desert if she wants one, no matter what she ate before ...<br/>\n<br/>\nI became more curious with food as I was growing up, and now I eat <br/>\npretty much everything (still don&#39;t like fruits, though, except for <br/>\na few of them) and I am always willingly to taste something new <br/>\n(there are a few &quot;textures&quot; that repell me). I feel good (don&#39;t know <br/>\nhow to say that : my body and I are good buddies)<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of my example, my sister is very relaxed with food issues <br/>\nand has never forced her daughters to eat anything. She even kept <br/>\nplenty of sweets at home with no restricted access and for a while <br/>\nmy younger niece really ate a lot of them and not very much of <br/>\nanything else ...

I&#39;m sorry this got so<br/>\nlong, I kept trying to revise it and pare it down, but kept adding<br/>\nstuff instead. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole food issue for me comes down to trust. People don&#39;t believe<br/>\nthat a 3 y.o. (or younger, since we&#39;ve basically been unfooding almost<br/>\nright from the beginning) can be in charge of their own food choices<br/>\nbecause they don&#39;t know about carbs, protein, good fats, bad fats,<br/>\nfiber, cholesterol, atherosclerosis, etc. But I have seen first hand<br/>\nthat even though my DD is drawn to chips and cookies sometimes, she<br/>\nconsumes them in moderation even though she is not limited by me.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if she *only* wanted to eat chips and cookies we&#39;d find a way to<br/>\nmake that work. It would cut into our current food and time budget a<br/>\nbit to make and buy healthier versions, but if DD was even more<br/>\nselective than she is now about food we&#39;d work it out without<br/>\ncompromising our RU beliefs. We&#39;d drive the 45 minutes to Whole Foods<br/>\nto buy the premade foods and the ingredients we needed. It would cost a<br/>\nlot more, and it would be a lot more trouble, but I&#39;m not about to let<br/>\nmy kid subsist solely on the brands of chips and cookies that we can<br/>\nbuy at our local supermarket. That would be irresponsible. Luckily for<br/>\nme, that&#39;s not what she wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we never went to the store together, or if we never went to<br/>\nrestaurants together she might never ask for fries or chips, but she<br/>\ngoes wherever I go. I&#39;m not going to keep her in an artificial bubble<br/>\nat home. I want her to experience life as fully as possible (time,<br/>\nbudget, and other restrictions permitting). She lives a healthy active<br/>\nlifestyle, stays well hydrated, and is basically a very happy healthy<br/>\nkid. Someday when they serve &quot;monkey platters&quot; at restaurants for kids<br/>\nthat&#39;s what I&#39;ll order, but for now fries are just about the only thing<br/>\nthey serve that she will eat. We of course always put bits of our<br/>\nchicken, fish, veggies, etc. on her plate but she doesn&#39;t eat them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case my point is getting lost, let me stress what is important to<br/>\nme. That she go through life maintaining the healthy active lifestyle<br/>\nthat she has now, learns to trust herself in the food choices that she<br/>\nmakes, as in everything else. And that she trusts me to be her partner,<br/>\nnot her boss. That she doesn&#39;t feel sneaky or guilty about &quot;bad&quot; foods.<br/>\nThat she looks at food as what it is: fuel that keeps us going, that<br/>\ncan be enjoyed, but isn&#39;t the end all and be all of the universe. You<br/>\ncan enjoy growing food, preparing food, eating food, and the act of<br/>\n&quot;breaking bread&quot; with your friends and family. And we enjoy all of<br/>\nthose things! But food is not love. Food is not a way to stuff your<br/>\nshame and low self esteem down inside. Food should not be used as a way<br/>\nto numb yourself to whatever stress and pain life sends you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter will never have to know the shame of having to stuff her<br/>\nchunky self into an unflattering gym uniform and struggle to take her<br/>\nbody -- a body that is forced to sit in a chair, hour after hour, day<br/>\nafter day -- and put it through ridiculous paces. Climbing ropes is FUN<br/>\nfor her because she&#39;s not being forced to do it while 30 other kids<br/>\npoint and laugh. Running is done for the sheer joy of it, not because<br/>\nyou are being tested on how fast you can run the mile.<br/>\n<br/>\nI trust that my daughter will learn more and more about food as she<br/>\nmatures, and it may not be about calorie counts, or grams of fat. It<br/>\nmay simply be based on how different foods taste, and how they make her<br/>\nfeel. How wonderful if I can give that gift to her by merely butting<br/>\nout! For her to be able to maintain a healthy weight without dieting or<br/>\nobsessing about grams of carbs! For her to feel good about herself even<br/>\nwith a few extra pounds (though she seems very lean now) and not<br/>\ndevelop anorexia or bulemia as so many young girls do.<br/>\n<br/>\nControlling what she eats now, and then having her suddenly be on her<br/>\nown without me there to police what she eats doesn&#39;t seem like the<br/>\nright path to me. We all have to find our own way, and this is my<br/>\napproach. The trust approach to food. Unfooding always sounds to me<br/>\nlike &quot;not feeding&quot; so maybe I&#39;ll just coin a new term: &quot;the total trust<br/>\napproach to toddler food and nutrition.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there an acronym in there? LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t read much about modeling in this discussion, but it&#39;s so<br/>\nimportant. These unschooled kids aren&#39;t making decisions in a vacuum.<br/>\nActually just writing that, I think someone *did* say it, but it bears<br/>\nrepeating. DD sees me eating fruit, veggies, chicken, salad and other<br/>\nhealthy stuff and she is always offered whatever I am eating, whatever<br/>\nDH is eating. She is simply not interested in many fruits or vegetables<br/>\nnow. She likes blueberries and that&#39;s fine with me. She likes peas, and<br/>\ncarrots, and that&#39;s fine too. She doesn&#39;t have to eat lettuce or<br/>\nbananas to be healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not like she NEVER eats healthy stuff, she just picks and chooses<br/>\nand some of it is healthy and some if it is a little on the sugary or<br/>\nsalty side. That&#39;s okay with me! She often asks for new foods and<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t eat them, but the tenth time I put it in front of her, she will<br/>\noften try it and then ask for more. She did this with strawberries. She<br/>\nsaw me buy them, she saw me wash them and slice them for Violet and for<br/>\nmyself and DH. She was often offered some and always declined. Then she<br/>\nasked for some and didn&#39;t eat them. This happened several times. Each<br/>\ntime she asked I just put a few on her plate with no expectations.<br/>\nMaybe the 5th or 6th time, she ate them and asked for more. That&#39;s an<br/>\napproach anyone can try and see what happens. When they ask for 3<br/>\nthings, just always add a 4th, and just keep doing it with the same 4th<br/>\nfood until they eventually try it. You don&#39;t even have to say anything!<br/>\n<br/>\nMealtime right now looks like this: if DD knows what she wants, cool.<br/>\nBut if she doesn&#39;t, I take one of those plates with the partitions and<br/>\nI put something protein-y like meat or pasta or cheese, some kind of<br/>\nveggie that she likes, and some kind of fruit that she likes. Then I&#39;ll<br/>\nadd one more thing that she normally doesn&#39;t like (I don&#39;t know, beans<br/>\nor something) that I&#39;d like her to try and I put the whole thing in<br/>\nfront of her. If she just eats one food, or just a few bites of each,<br/>\nfine, the rest goes back in the fridge for later. No stress, no bribes,<br/>\nno ultimatums, no pressure, no guilt. Just here you go. All done? Okay,<br/>\nlet&#39;s go play. Simple, no?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll buy cookies or make cookies, usually oatmeal, and when we run out<br/>\nI just tell her we&#39;ll put it on the list (if I&#39;m not feeling up to<br/>\nmaking them) and she&#39;s satisfied with that because she knows I mean it.<br/>\nSame with popsicles. If we run out of her favorite we go down the line<br/>\nuntil we&#39;re working on the least favorite kinds and she knows when we<br/>\ngo to the store soon her faves will be replenished. Trust. I don&#39;t hold<br/>\nup cookies or popsicles as being a reward, or a &quot;naughty&quot; food, or<br/>\nsomething that she can&#39;t eat for breakfast, or only after she finishes<br/>\nher peas.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter studying journalism and biology as an undergrad, I was *this<br/>\nclose* to going to grad school for nutrition science. I was going to<br/>\nbash my brains in trying to find the TRUTH in all of the half-truths,<br/>\npropaganda, and lies out there when it comes to diet and nutrition, and<br/>\nthen translate all of the science-speak into normal terms for normal<br/>\npeople. For rates that the average person can actually afford! I<br/>\ndecided against it only because I hate school! It&#39;s so expensive, and<br/>\nall they do is set you loose with a textbook and then test you on it.<br/>\nOh, and boring lectures that are basically the same info as the text.<br/>\nFor this they want tens of thousands of dollars? Hmpf. Maybe it&#39;s<br/>\ndifferent at the grad level but I&#39;ll never know!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole cigarette analogy is absurd, IMO. I can&#39;t remember if it was<br/>\nhere or at UB or both, but someone basically asked would you put a bowl<br/>\nof cigarettes out for your kids to smoke and equating that to parents<br/>\nwho give their kids &quot;junk&quot; foods. Smoking is a combination of modeling,<br/>\nrebellion, and addiction. Kids whose parents smoke are more likely to<br/>\nsmoke. Kids who are more susceptible to peer pressure are more likely<br/>\nto smoke to fit in with the &quot;cool&quot; kids. Kids who want to say to their<br/>\ncontrolling parents, &quot;FU! This is my body and I&#39;m going to desecrate it<br/>\njust to piss you off!&quot; are more likely to smoke. Kids who try smoking a<br/>\nfew times for whatever reason, curiosity or whatever, who have<br/>\naddictive personalities are more likely to keep smoking. There are so<br/>\nmany factors at work here that have nothing whatsoever to do with food<br/>\nthat it makes no sense to compare the two. Especially since most of the<br/>\nfactors I named above don&#39;t even apply to most unschooled kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vijay</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15777,"nextTopicId":15797}}
