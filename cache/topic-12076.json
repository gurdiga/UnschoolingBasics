It&#39;s<br/>\npossible I&#39;ve been drinking coffee for forty years.   Every other week<br/>\nthere&#39;s some report contradicting the last report about coffee being<br/>\nhealthy or unhealthy.  I think stress over what&#39;s healthy or unhealthy is<br/>\nmore unhealthy than coffee. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend and I each have colds.
