Though there are plenty of distinctions she has hit upon that are relevant--she does impose more rules and limits than her radical unschooling peers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been there before and it&#39;s not easy.  She has probably spent as much time (if not more) beating herself up as she has spent putting others down. It&#39;s all about her trying to feel ok about her choices, while realizing there are better choices out there.  That&#39;s a really scary concept!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, Ren, your comment to this woman was beautiful and inspiring, as it referenced the joy and freedom your family has.  Nothing angry or belittling.  As an unschooler, growing more radical, I appreciated reading it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Paige McKinney<br/>\nMom to 3 boys...unschooling me!<br/>\nHunter (9), Skyler (6) and Jasper (3)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Ren Allen <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, April 26, 2007 5:18 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [SPAM] [unschoolingbasics] Anon post--failing at unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This was sent to me today, with a request to post anonymously:<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://love2bhomeschoolerscommentary.blogspot.com/\">http://love2bhomeschoolerscommentary.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  This blog is from an unschooler who has lived the life and is now<br/>\n  bashing unschooling.
