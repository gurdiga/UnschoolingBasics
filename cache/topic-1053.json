","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-761801078\">Hi everyone<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m Helen, from Geneva, beginning her second year of unschooling with <br/>\nSylvain (almost 7 yo) and his 2 sisters, Cyrielle and Circé (5 <br/>\nand ... 2).<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I would like to thank you once again. Reading you is really <br/>\ninspiring. What you say makes so much sense and is so liberating. <br/>\nWhen I feel a bit down, puff, I come back to UB and read a few posts <br/>\nand it makes me feel soooo much better. I used to be part of a list <br/>\narond non-violent education, which doesn&#39;t exist anymore, and it is <br/>\nthe first time that I feel like that since then. THANKS.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy questions are :<br/>\n<br/>\n- how do you manage to keep the balance between being there for them <br/>\nand still doing what you love (I mean : the OTHERS things that you <br/>\nlove) and, on the other hand, between not *teaching* them things but <br/>\nstill sharing with them, between letting them free and proposing <br/>\nthings, etc. Very often, if I only propose things, they are not <br/>\nreally interested and would rather stay at home and play - but if we <br/>\ndo stay at home, after a certain while, we&#39;re not having such a great <br/>\ntime. It&#39;s like they really need to move and see other things and be <br/>\na little &quot;led&quot; ... I find the balance difficult to find - I know you <br/>\ndon&#39;t have any miraculous recipe, but I&#39;m still interested in how you <br/>\nare doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n- the other thing is around &quot;curricular&quot; activities (not very sure of <br/>\nmy English, there). I don&#39;t know how to phrase my question, there are <br/>\ndifferent levels in it : first, my son wants me to make lessons with <br/>\nhim, and asks me for them; second, it is something I like, playing <br/>\nwith words, with numbers, with nice plastic material etc. - and I <br/>\nlike doing that with him and his sister; third, here in Geneva, <br/>\nhomeschooled kids are tested in French and mathematics every year and <br/>\nmust keep up with the school level (same progression, same order, <br/>\nsame rhythm). So if I want to be authorized to go on <br/>\nwith &quot;unschooling&quot;, well, I have to ... not really unschool. I have <br/>\nto train him for the tests, somehow, which means making these <br/>\nactivities - or at least a minimum of them. Any advice here ? Do you <br/>\nthink that curricular activities could be &quot;harmful&quot; for them - and <br/>\nfor our unschooling journey ?<br/>\n<br/>\nHoping you understand me :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards from this side of the Atlantic ocean ...<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152271008,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"ruekream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] A few questions","postDate":"1088337645","msgId":1162,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyNWQwMWM0NWMzZSQ2MjFhMzkzMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFkOC4yNTBiYjJmZC4yZTEwMGQ1YkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":1160,"nextInTopic":26223,"prevInTime":1161,"nextInTime":1163,"topicId":1053,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... address handy? **Homeschool Social Register: http://www.homeschoolmedia.net/register/index.phtml [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1090122199\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;There&#39;s a national register.
