I have to agree here with the &quot;own money&quot; idea, and will <br/>\n&gt; point out that the amount of that money isn&#39;t important. If it&#39;s only <br/>\n&gt; a little, well, then, that&#39;s realistic for your family and he&#39;ll find <br/>\n&gt; the challenge is to be economical enough to use what he&#39;s got. Also, <br/>\n&gt; the driving around could be an issue, like you said, so I think the <br/>\n&gt; suggestion others made to limit how often you&#39;ll go out to get stuff <br/>\n&gt; is a good idea, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do think sometimes kids get really excited when they realize they can <br/>\n&quot;save&quot; money for their family by buying inexpensive stuff or finding <br/>\nfree stuff. They often forget to pay attention to whether or not they <br/>\nactually need it! Gee, where do they get that, I wonder?;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck! (p.s. If you really have that uncomfortable feeling about <br/>\ncompulsiveness, try reducing as many stress factors as you can in his <br/>\nlife and seeing if it also reduces the drive for stuff -- it could just <br/>\nbe an expression of some underlying anxiety, same as it often is for <br/>\nadults...).
