Although we have always respected our <br/>\nchildren&#39;s right to learn in their own time, it took me a bit longer <br/>\nto completely &quot;see the light&quot; and respect the children&#39;s ability to <br/>\nLIVE without my (and my husbands) telling them exactly HOW to do <br/>\nit.  We were always more &quot;lenient&quot; than most parents.  For example, <br/>\nwhen they were younger, we would not eat or drink in front of them <br/>\nand tell them they could not eat or drink the same thing.  We also <br/>\nwould assume the child knew his/her comfort level and didn&#39;t force <br/>\nthem to wear coats (or any other clothing item an adult would feel <br/>\nis necessary depending on the weather).  In these small, everyday <br/>\nitems, we backed off (much to grandma&#39;s chagrin!) and let the <br/>\nchidren make their own choices.  We still don&#39;t dictate bedtime, <br/>\nmealtime (other than a sit-down together dinner), etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...I feel many things are being handled in a positive, respectful <br/>\nmanner.  My struggle in this quest is applying a lot of <br/>\nthe &quot;unschooling in life&quot; principles that I admire to a family with <br/>\nfive children.  I don&#39;t have five different-aged children, I had a <br/>\nset of quadruplets (they are 8) and a single child 18 months later <br/>\n(he is 6).  So basically, I have a small classroom in my house.  I <br/>\nunderstand most people here are not in the same position, but <br/>\nperhaps there are a few on this list who have 3+ children who are <br/>\nclose in age?  The problems I run into basically stem from one <br/>\nsource: peer pressure and/or distraction of peers.  Five children <br/>\nall the same age distract each other.  They are not abnormally <br/>\ndistracted for their age, they just multiply it times 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I love the idea of not requiring chores, of leading by example, <br/>\netc.  But here is a common scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nMom:  Hey guys, the house is getting trashed, and we need to go to <br/>\nchess class (for two of the boys). Could you help me pick up a room <br/>\nor two before we go?<br/>\n<br/>\nKids:  We&#39;re in the middle of playing Pokemon, just started a book, <br/>\netc....can we do it in a little bit?<br/>\n<br/>\nMom:  Sure.  How about in 20 minutes we do it?<br/>\n<br/>\n(In these 20 minutes, I may start picking up, hoping to teach by <br/>\nexample...)<br/>\n<br/>\nMom:  OK guys, its been 20 minutes.  Could you help me now?<br/>\n<br/>\nKids:  OK!<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo minutes later, two are arguing over who gets to pick up Lego&#39;s <br/>\n(which I let them deal with - they actually are fairly good at <br/>\nconflict resolution among themselves, but of course, this takes time <br/>\naway from cleaning), one found a transformer he is playing with and <br/>\ntwo are doing all the work themselves.  Of course, these two are not <br/>\nthat happy about the situation because they want to help out, but <br/>\nothers are not so they get angry and stop helping.  I defer to the <br/>\ntime, we leave for chess class and nothing really was cleaned.  Not <br/>\na big deal by itself, I can let the room stay messy, but it is a <br/>\nmetaphor for how EVERYTHING gets done in our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother situation:<br/>\n<br/>\nOne child REALLY wants to take choir.  I find her a choir class, but <br/>\nthe parents have to stay on the premises.  It&#39;s a co-op, so I ask <br/>\nthe other kids if they would like to take a class, too.  They all <br/>\npick a class, enjoy themselves for a few weeks, then one decides he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like it anymore.  We talk about it and he makes the decision <br/>\nto stop attending the class.  Now one of his brothers, who was in a <br/>\ndifferent class and liking it, doesn&#39;t want to &quot;have&quot; to go either.  <br/>\nNot because he doesn&#39;t enjoy the class, but because its not fair <br/>\nthat his brother isn&#39;t and he is.  OK.  Two are not in classes.  <br/>\nThis is fine, except these two don&#39;t like going to the co-op now <br/>\nbecause they don&#39;t have anything to do.  They will bring things <br/>\nwith, but get bored easily because they have to stay in a certain <br/>\narea quietly until their siblings are done with class.  We don&#39;t <br/>\nmake them sit quietly at home, so this is hard for them, even though <br/>\nthey &quot;get&quot; why they could be disruptive to other people who are <br/>\ntrying to enjoy their classes.  Now its three who want to be there, <br/>\ntwo who don&#39;t, and me trying to respect everyone&#39;s needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis co-op situation is not the end of the world, and we are working <br/>\non their ability to quietly entertain themselves.  They will find a <br/>\ncomfortable arrangement in time, I know.  BUT it is a good example <br/>\nof how hard it is to balance everyone&#39;s needs without &quot;making&quot; some <br/>\nof the kids do something they don&#39;t want to do.  I have considered a <br/>\nsitter, but we don&#39;t have a daytime sitter available, and even if I <br/>\ndid, I couldn&#39;t afford to pay a sitter every time one child wanted <br/>\nto take a class and the others did not.  One may not want to go to <br/>\nthe library, but four do. They have to learn some give and take, <br/>\nbecause that&#39;s how large families function.  Does anyone have any <br/>\nadvice on this front?  How did you balance everyones needs?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother big concern is keeping the house clean and the chores done.  <br/>\nI used to make them do chores, and although they never really <br/>\ngrumbled about doing them (they were so used to it - they had been <br/>\ndoing chores since they were 3 and they were fun then!), I backed <br/>\noff from this in an effort to reduce my being an authority figure.  <br/>\nIt has been a year now, and here is the problem.  The odds of the <br/>\nkids WANTING to help me clean are really low, because they would <br/>\nmuch rather play with the kids who are doing something else.  Even <br/>\nif they do start to help, something exciting happens and the <br/>\ncleaning never actually gets done.  The idea of &quot;I (Mom) am the one <br/>\nwho wants it clean, so I have to clean it if they don&#39;t want to <br/>\nhelp&quot; is a hard one for me to swallow, because seven people in one <br/>\nhouse makes things extremely dirty.  Yes, we will live in stench if <br/>\nthe toilets aren&#39;t cleaned (four boys &lt;g&gt;), and everything will be <br/>\ncluttered to the point of distraction if we don&#39;t work together to <br/>\nclean it up. So the idea of leading by example is lost because the <br/>\ndistractibility level in the house is so high, they don&#39;t notice <br/>\nand/or hear Mom&#39;s needs.  When they do, they help.  It&#39;s just few <br/>\nand far between.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same problem lies in the TV and video games.  This is the one <br/>\narea in which I have not given up control, and here is why:  If one <br/>\nchild watches TV or plays a video game, they all watch.  Taking <br/>\nturns takes ALL day if they are unlimited.  Literally.  One child <br/>\ndoes not appreciate video games, and can entertain herself for <br/>\nawhile, but then can be reduced to tears because her brothers ignore <br/>\nher ALL DAY.  I can find things to do with her to a point, and she <br/>\ncan entertain herself to a point, but she gets depressed because she <br/>\nreally just wants to do stuff with her brothers.  Two of the boys, <br/>\nthen, get really crabby and depressed when they &quot;do media&quot; all day.  <br/>\nThey don&#39;t eat well (they do if they don&#39;t play games), don&#39;t sleep <br/>\nwell and become really disrespectful to everyone else in the house.  <br/>\nHow do other people balance this?  I tried letting it run its course <br/>\nabout 6 months ago, and it was one of the worst two months we have <br/>\never had as a family.  My husband finally put an end to it and I am <br/>\nso happy he did, because our lives literally turned around in many <br/>\nways once we limited the boys to 1/2 hour a day (so two hours total <br/>\nof &quot;media time&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo basically, and I am sorry for this being so long and more a <br/>\nstoryline than questions, I would like to hear other people&#39;s <br/>\nsolutions to radical unschooling with large families.  I admire many <br/>\nof the ideas and solutions I see on this sight, but it seems they <br/>\ndon&#39;t always work in my house.  I feel like I have to place some <br/>\nlimits that I don&#39;t want to be placing and make the kids do some <br/>\nthings they don&#39;t want to be doing.  Has anyone else tried methods I <br/>\nmay have not thought about?  I see how well unschooling has worked <br/>\ntowards their academics and brain development, but it doesn&#39;t seem <br/>\nto be applying in all regards of life like I want it to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone needs me to be more specific, please ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen, tired but happy Mom to Dakota, Connor, Sage, Cheyenne and <br/>\nArizona</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26180,"nextTopicId":26156}}
