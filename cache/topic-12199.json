The money is <br/>\nnon-refundable and there is no extra money to put them in another sport. Do <br/>\nyou just let them quit & explain that you cannot pay for another <br/>\nsport/activity at this point?

(Somewhere, <br/>\nI&#39;ll have to find it.)<br/>\nFirst thing, I would find a way for them to experience the sport without a <br/>\nbig investment. That&#39;s a lot of pressure on a little one. There are two <br/>\nhomeschool soccer teams within a 30 mile radius. $15.00 a season, bring a <br/>\nball and wear shin guards. Total of about 35 dollars. If there weren&#39;t any <br/>\nteams I would send an email out to my local list and find others who are <br/>\ninterested in starting one.<br/>\nEasy. No big investment.<br/>\n2.  I would list the equipment on Ebay and sell it. Once it has sold, I <br/>\nwould say This is what we have to work with, what can we do with it?  I <br/>\nwould also ask for some of the money back from the team, it may not be <br/>\nrefunded but I would try.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also LOADS of interesting things to do other than Football in the <br/>\nfall, baseball and soccer in the spring.
