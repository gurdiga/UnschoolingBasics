I haven&#39;t found ANYONE<br/>\n&gt; unschooling in<br/>\n&gt; Germany, HOMEschoolers are only 1000 in whole<br/>\n&gt; Germany and it might<br/>\n&gt; well be that none of them is unschooling, because<br/>\n&gt; already<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling is illegal and the ones who are<br/>\n&gt; tolerated by the state<br/>\n&gt; are probably only tolerated because they show some<br/>\n&gt; kind of progress<br/>\n&gt; in their studies and do tests and such. I guess<br/>\n&gt; there are others who<br/>\n&gt; &quot;unschool&quot; with school as I&#39;m doing it, but so far I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t found<br/>\n&gt; anyone. I came to unschooling because I read &quot;The<br/>\n&gt; Continuum Concept&quot;<br/>\n&gt; â the ones who have read this around me either<br/>\n&gt; think it&#39;s crap or are<br/>\n&gt; limiting what they learned to the baby time and<br/>\n&gt; carry their kids,<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s all. They think it&#39;s impossible to implement<br/>\n&gt; any of the ideas<br/>\n&gt; presented in tcc, because it we just aren&#39;t living<br/>\n&gt; in tribes anymore.<br/>\n&gt; Trying to find a way to do in spite of these<br/>\n&gt; arguments, I found<br/>\n&gt; unschooling, and it appeals to me even more than tcc<br/>\n&gt; did. It will be<br/>\n&gt; harder, but so far I have only confronted my best<br/>\n&gt; friend with<br/>\n&gt; unschooling (and she doesn&#39;t get it :-( but she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; very respectful and<br/>\n&gt; she accepts I do it my way, we&#39;re still friends) and<br/>\n&gt; have avoided<br/>\n&gt; telling anyone for fear of negative discussions<br/>\n&gt; which will make me<br/>\n&gt; doubt again before I even get unschooling myself<br/>\n&gt; :-D.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s actually a mom in Germany who was working on<br/>\n&gt; starting a group <br/>\n&gt; there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe she found herself in hot water because of the<br/>\n&gt; laws. I can&#39;t find <br/>\n&gt; her anywhere now. I&#39;ve asked Sandra: maybe she&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; chime in soon with a <br/>\n&gt; name or address. I know that info used to be on<br/>\n&gt; Sandra&#39;s site. I can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; find it now though. If she has it, I&#39;ll forward the<br/>\n&gt; info on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I sent my old au pair (in Bodenheim---Stadtteil<br/>\n&gt; Mainz) a copy of Rue&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; book and a sling for her new baby. &lt;g&gt; I don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; she used the <br/>\n&gt; sling---those Kinderwagen are so nice! &lt;G&gt; And I<br/>\n&gt; doubt she read the <br/>\n&gt; book. She thinks I&#39;m a bit nuts. &lt;g&gt; Plus, her<br/>\n&gt; spoken english is so <br/>\n&gt; much better than her written/reading of it---books<br/>\n&gt; are hard for her. <br/>\n&gt; But we have talked about it on the phone and when<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s visited. So <br/>\n&gt; there *ARE* Germans who have heard of it!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You might want to consider finding homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; *Americans* in the <br/>\n&gt; military. They *are* allowed to homeschool. A few<br/>\n&gt; might even be <br/>\n&gt; unschooling---although quietly. What city/region are<br/>\n&gt; you in?

You might <br/>\nthink that forcing yourself to do these things (or other things that <br/>\npeople suggest) is doing unschooling `right&#39;.  So many things in our <br/>\nculture are about doing it `right&#39;, so it&#39;s very easy to slip into <br/>\nthat mindset.  I believe that being genuine in what you do -- in <br/>\nwhatever you do -- is the most important.  Your daughter will smell <br/>\nsomething in those cookies a mile away, if she senses that her mom, <br/>\nwho is not a cookie maker, is trying to bake up something that looks <br/>\nlike someone else&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was working so hard to get the unschooling thing, I think the <br/>\nabsolute best thing that helped me was actively seeking, finding and <br/>\nholding JOY in my heart.  Well, that certainly isn&#39;t very concrete, <br/>\nis it?  Quite honestly, I&#39;m more of a, just-the-facts-mum kind of <br/>\nperson, so even uttering the word gives me twinges of <br/>\nembarrassment.  But, whenever I put joy as THE priority, things <br/>\nreally opened up for my kids, my relationship with my husband and <br/>\nthe whole unschooling experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpening up to joy is hard in some ways, thrilling in others and <br/>\ndefinitely freeing.  On one hand it seems like you are doing <br/>\nsomething wrong to enjoy yourself so much.  On the other hand, you <br/>\nexperience the same thrill that you get say, when you are on top of <br/>\na roller coater just about to go down.  In a way, I think that it is <br/>\nmore comfortable to hold our fears close to us.  Letting go seems <br/>\nunreasonable - dangerous.  We MUST protect ourselves from the <br/>\nthreatening world, right?  But when we finally find a way to let go, <br/>\nthe world is not as threatening/dangerous as we otherwise thought <br/>\nand what is left is empowerment.  The feeling is quite heady.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that helped me along with the unschooling process <br/>\nwas asking `why&#39; a lot.  Why is he watching TV?  Why is he still <br/>\nwatching TV?  Why am I worrying about him watching TV?  Why don&#39;t I <br/>\nget off this couch and stop worrying and get on with my own <br/>\ninterests?  Why do I fear some things and not others?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I seriously pondered these questions, I began to see better <br/>\nwhat my children were experiencing and learning.  The why&#39;s go even <br/>\ndeeper than this, but I&#39;ll leave that for another post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So I guess this feeling that it is not &quot;enough&quot; makes me feel<br/>\n&gt;the urge to suggest more things which I wouldn&#39;t normally do, but<br/>\n&gt;just to provide a richer spectrum of possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe that the richer spectrum comes when you begin to be open <br/>\nto the possibilities and not force the possibilities.

That is when I say something like: &quot;hey, I&#39;m going to bake some bread, anyone want to help?&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s a great day outside, want to go out and play with me?&quot; or &quot;I saw an advertisement for a cool museum, want to go?&quot;  This way it offers them a choice of things to do. If they say, &quot;no, not now&quot;, I drop it and wait. When they are ready, they come back and ask to do whatever I had mentioned, or ask to do something else. There are days (while de-schooling) that they didn&#39;t even want to pause long enough to go to the bathroom. It&#39;s all ok. Their brains are still<br/>\n working in there. Also, about the computer, how many of us need to actively pull ourselves away?  How old are we? and Can we expect more from our kids? I remember getting bored of tv and going off and doing other things. I didn&#39;t have one in my home growing up, but we did at Grandma&#39;s house and it was on all the time.  We even had one of our own if the grownups were watching something we didn&#39;t want to watch, we just went into the other room. It got boring, though. Just be patient and wait. Things take time. This also gives you the opportunity to just be with her, too.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Keep listening to her, and she will let you know what she needs. Sometimes they just need to know they have some control over their world - and when it is confirmed, they will be more willing to add variety, rather than just that &#39;prohibited&#39; passtime.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  In peace,<br/>\n  Ginger<br/>\n<br/>\nSolé &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:solelokuai@...\">solelokuai@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Keep in mind that we were also once where you are now!

I know that I have to &quot;do&quot; it (&quot;learning <br/>\nby doing&quot;)  but then I sometimes need to know HOW to do it. For <br/>\ninstance, the suggestions question  of course I have tried to do it <br/>\nall by myself for several weeks but I still don&#39;t get it, so I ask. I <br/>\ntry to keep in mind all the new things I know now and believe in, but <br/>\nsometimes I don&#39;t know how to &quot;do&quot; it. I have observed that the more <br/>\nI just do it, I internalize the new principles better then just by <br/>\nmemorizing or reading about it, obvious. But sometimes I need <br/>\nconcrete examples on how to do it  this might be examples of how you <br/>\nwould do it and somtimes concrete answers whether or not something is <br/>\n&quot;allowed&quot;.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I STILL think about it a LOT! I STILL try to make the right<br/>\n&gt; decisions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is it *confusing*? Or just difficult?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I struggled, but I wasn&#39;t confused. I just had a hard time making the<br/>\n&gt; adjustment. Giving up old ways versus the new. It was hard, but I<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t confused. Is that the word you mean to use?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah it is really confusing  it is actually both, difficult AND <br/>\nconfusing, and then again even more difficult because of the <br/>\nconfusions. For instance, the recent post of Talia (taliasafa) is <br/>\nvery confusing: I find (no offense, Talia, and maybe I&#39;m wrong!), <br/>\nthat what she&#39;s doing is quite manipulative and I thought that these <br/>\nthings are exactly what we are not &quot;allowed&quot; to do, what unschoolers <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do, and then I&#39;m huh?? I thought.... Just when I thought &quot;I <br/>\ngot it&quot;, someone will write something that completely confuses me  <br/>\nand sometimes I also get confused when I try to implement the ideas <br/>\nof unschooling in real life and I get stuck in loops. Like hm, she&#39;s <br/>\nwatching TV right now. She&#39;s actually watching TV all day. When would <br/>\nbe the right moment to suggest other things to do? should I suggest <br/>\nanything at all, she&#39;s happily watching TV all day, why should I <br/>\ninterrupt her? But maybe she&#39;s just watching tv for lack of better <br/>\nthings to do! But TV isn&#39;t bad, so nothing is &quot;better&quot;. Ok, then I <br/>\nshould suggest something. I suggest something, she doesn&#39;t want to. <br/>\nHm  but maybe she wants to do something else. Should I suggest <br/>\nanother thing? But then I interrupt again. But maybe she needs more <br/>\nimput! and so on and on  I find it confusing that on the one hand I <br/>\nwant to allow her to watch TV whenever and all the time she wants and <br/>\non the other hand I want to do things with her, but have no real <br/>\nspace to tell her because she is watching all day and I don&#39;t quite <br/>\nknow when to suggest anything and if I should suggest just one thing <br/>\nor more or just leave her alone until she&#39;s bored even if this means <br/>\nin five months. :-)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; We can give you examples of what has worked for us in a similar<br/>\n&gt; situation, but we&#39;re not you.

So I <br/>\nwhen I asked if &quot;postponing is allowed&quot;, I asked if there were any <br/>\n(to me unknown) arguments against postponing. Maybe you would have <br/>\nsaid oh nooo, we never ever postpone things because of X, and maybe <br/>\nthat X I just couldn&#39;t think of myself even though it seems obvious <br/>\nafter hearing about it  just as almost all of what unschooling is <br/>\nabout. Now I find everything so self evident and I feel like &quot;duh, <br/>\nwhy didn&#39;t I think of this before?&quot; &quot;how could I possibly think that <br/>\ncoercive methods could work even if I saw each day that they kinda <br/>\ndidn&#39;t?&quot; :-) But before, I couldn&#39;t think of these things and &quot;felt&quot; <br/>\nthat my methods were the &quot;best&quot; one can do.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I haven&#39;t found ANYONE unschooling in  <br/>\nGermany, HOMEschoolers are only 1000 in whole Germany and it might  <br/>\nwell be that none of them is unschooling, because already  <br/>\nhomeschooling is illegal and the ones who are tolerated by the state  <br/>\nare probably only tolerated because they show some kind of progress  <br/>\nin their studies and do tests and such. I guess there are others who  <br/>\n&quot;unschool&quot; with school as I&#39;m doing it, but so far I haven&#39;t found  <br/>\nanyone. I came to unschooling because I read &quot;The Continuum Concept&quot;  <br/>\n– the ones who have read this around me either think it&#39;s crap or are  <br/>\nlimiting what they learned to the baby time and carry their kids,  <br/>\nthat&#39;s all.

Because if I could<br/>\nchoose what *I* want to do than it would mostly be chatting, surfing<br/>\non the internet, reading emails and actually I&#39;m most of my free time<br/>\nand work time at the computer and I really enjoy it. Some other times<br/>\nI cook or clean the house, which I both enjoy and can ask her to<br/>\naccompany me, rarely I will do some &quot;gardening&quot; at our balcony, I&#39;ll<br/>\nread something... but I will almost never ever do any handcrafting or<br/>\npainting or sewing or knitting or baking cookies. So all the variety<br/>\nof things you seem to be doing are things that I have to &quot;force&quot;<br/>\nmyself to do in order to provide a &quot;I will bake cookies now wanna<br/>\njoin?&quot;, to provide a wide spectrum of things one can do. Maybe you<br/>\nthink &quot;get a life!&quot; but I quite like what I do and have absolutely no<br/>\nproblem with it for myself, except for not being able to naturally<br/>\nprovide a rich environment for my children.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe not &quot;get a life!&quot;---but what does your *daughter* like??? You may <br/>\nactually have to step out of your comfort zone here.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may find that she may have the same interests as you---and that <br/>\nwould be easy. But if she&#39;s a &quot;crafter/artisan&quot;-type, you may need to <br/>\nmake some changes---or at the very least, find her someone with the <br/>\nsame interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron made my life easy in that he and I shares many of he same <br/>\ninterests: art, food, magic, music. But when he got into skateboards, I <br/>\nhad to do some fancy footwork! &lt;g&gt; It was hard to make myself pay $100 <br/>\nfor new trucks and wheels (or whatever). I had no desire to cart him to <br/>\nskate parks all over the state. His hobby did nothing for *me*. But it <br/>\nwas important to HIM. I swallowed my dislike, and I learned to <br/>\nunderstand tricks and recognize big name skaters. We visited all the <br/>\nskate parks and sent him to Woodward Skate Camp twice. I bought clothes <br/>\nand boards and was on a first-name basis with the owners of the two <br/>\nskate stores in town! I fed that passion!<br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan&#39;s passion now is anime and manga and all things Japanese. How I <br/>\nwish Joyce lived next door! &lt;bwg&gt; I could just close my eyes and wish <br/>\nthis phase away, but instead, I embrace his passion. We painted all the <br/>\nmajor YuGiOH! characters on his walls and bought a YuGi bedspread. We <br/>\nthrew a huge YuGiOH! birthday party. We buy all the newest anime movies <br/>\nand manga books. I supply endless reams of paper and pencils for <br/>\ndrawing his own manga characters. We eat Japanese often (not much of a <br/>\nhardship for me! &lt;G&gt;). He has a real kimono and sandals. Ben&#39;s taking <br/>\nhim to their first Anime Convention soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are not things we would choose for ourselves, but our children <br/>\naren&#39;t mini replicas of *us*. Often we need to step outside what *we* <br/>\nwould rather do and embrace what makes *them* tick. You&#39;ll learn a <br/>\nlot---and you may even find a new passion yourself! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe older they get, the more their passions may vary from what *you* <br/>\nfind interesting. Putting down their passions or dismissing them as <br/>\nstupid or as not important is damaging. You really need to be <br/>\ninterested and interesting. Some things are harder than others to <br/>\nstomach. But if you DO show interest in her passions, you will see the <br/>\ndo amazing things!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n With my bf it&#39;s the same,<br/>\nwe LOVE computers and internet and we use this medium for many things<br/>\n(being creative, reading and writing, contacting people, organising<br/>\nthings, working etc.) I used to think I was &quot;addicted&quot; to my computer<br/>\nor to Internet, but all these texts about tv and video games not<br/>\nbeing addictive for unschoolers I&#39;ve read have made me realize that<br/>\nthis is just what I need, use and enjoy. Since we are unschooling we<br/>\ndo ask her each (rare) time we stand up from it if she wants to join<br/>\nus cooking/cleaning/playing/reading/bathing/going out – I just don&#39;t<br/>\nknow if this is &quot;enough&quot;. We do sit with her while she watches TV<br/>\n(sometimes with sometimes without our laptops) now and she plays with<br/>\nher own computer right next to us in our &quot;office&quot; so we are always<br/>\nthere to help and talk about it and someitmes play with her if she<br/>\nwants. So I guess this feeling that it is not &quot;enough&quot; makes me feel<br/>\nthe urge to suggest more things which I wouldn&#39;t normally do, but<br/>\njust to provide a richer spectrum of possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really good that you&#39;re comfortable with what makes you happy and <br/>\nthat you&#39;ve quit seeing it as an addiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what are your daughter&#39;s passions? I DO think that you need to <br/>\nprovide a &quot;richer spectrum of possibilities.&quot; (nice way to put it!) <br/>\nWhat does she love? It *may* be only the TV for now. If so, go with it. <br/>\nBut be ready to explore new territory as she grows older---and to step <br/>\nout of your comfort zone!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.

Yeah - how about multiplayer online gaming? Or <br/>\nsomething like Neopets where you can send messages to each other and <br/>\nbuy stuff in each other&#39;s shops and all like that? Do you blog? <br/>\nWould she like to try having her own website? There&#39;s a million <br/>\nbillion things online that can lead to other things and other things <br/>\nand other things... DH saw some large inexpensive focusing lenses <br/>\n(fresnel lenses) while surfing for something else. They were cheap <br/>\nso he ordered 2. That led to playing with focal length of the lens <br/>\n(and almost setting the dining table on fire!). One thing led to <br/>\nanother over time (long stretch, like two years or so) and now we <br/>\nhave a tidy little firepit area in the backyard for making small <br/>\ncampfires and toasting marshmallows. He wasn&#39;t looking for it, it <br/>\njust happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does SHE want/wish/desire to try? What have you &quot;always wanted <br/>\nto try&quot;? Anything from A to Z - from &quot;gee what&#39;s the difference <br/>\nbetween regular tuna and Albacore tuna?&quot; to &quot;will Zinnias grow in a <br/>\nwindow box?&quot; (see I got that a-z in lol). Listen closely when you&#39;re <br/>\nwatching TV together and when she&#39;s on her laptop - what is she <br/>\nsearching on, commenting on, etc? Have a James Bond movie marathon <br/>\nor start from James Bond and watch all of Sean Connery&#39;s movies or <br/>\nget all the spin off type parodies of Bond movies (the old Casino <br/>\nRoyale, for instance) and maybe compare various secret <br/>\nagent &#39;styles&#39;. Or, just compare the different actors who played <br/>\nBond. (do you get the idea that my guys like Bond? I just like <br/>\nthe &#39;scenery&#39; lol) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, too, expand your whole household&#39;s world sometimes just for <br/>\nfun. For instance, we&#39;ve gotten to really enjoy fondue - I&#39;ve liked <br/>\nit for a long time but neither DH nor DS had ever tried it. So, we <br/>\nlooked up recipes and made some - now it&#39;s a favorite fun thing to <br/>\ndo with just us or with guests. DS also likes sushi because he asked <br/>\nabout it when we walked past a sushi restaurant next to his favorite <br/>\ngame shop. So, next time we planned on going out to eat, we went <br/>\nthere. We even one time went in search of raclette cheese because I <br/>\nhad had it on a trip to Switzerland and I just got a hankering for <br/>\nit. So first I had to explain that it&#39;s a cheese AND a dish. Then we <br/>\ntracked some down at a local Wild Oats store - they actually had <br/>\nseveral varieties of raclette! Then we got the rest of the <br/>\ningredients and had ourselves a cheese feast with raclette and <br/>\nboiled potatoes and other assorted &#39;toppings&#39;. It was fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nBe curious about life. Don&#39;t &#39;suggest&#39; things just to get her to do <br/>\nthem but go for things you are interested in yourself and then offer <br/>\nthem. If you do nothing else but simply sit and watch people off <br/>\nyour balcony or check out a sunset (or a sunrise), that&#39;s something. <br/>\nTry a different flavor of tea if you&#39;re a tea drinker. Go grocery <br/>\nshopping at a store clear across town just to see what that store is <br/>\nlike. Make pancakes for breakfast and put more than just the <br/>\nstandard maple syrup on the table and see what happens (we typically <br/>\nhave chocolate chips, jam, syrup, and honey on the table for <br/>\npancakes; oatmeal has butter, milk, syrup, honey, sugar - brown & <br/>\nwhite, chocolate chips, cinnamon or cinnamon chips, raisins, <br/>\npecans, ... whatever sounds interesting...)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, in some ways you are going to end up stretching yourself - <br/>\nI never anticipated knowing much about James Bond, Pokemon or <br/>\nNeopets but now I do. It&#39;s not a one way street - I&#39;ve been <br/>\nintroduced to new things by DS and I&#39;ve introduced new things to <br/>\nhim. I&#39;d always wanted to be able to pick out a few tunes on the <br/>\npiano, so I went after it - not to &quot;get&quot; DS to do it but simply <br/>\nbecause I was interested. Now, DS will go in and sit and invent <br/>\nmusical pieces just for fun and I can play a couple pieces fairly <br/>\nfluidly (and DH plays by ear). DS was interested in where words came <br/>\nfrom, so I found him a website (put the link in his favorites) so <br/>\nthat he can look them up at will. <br/>\n<br/>\nGo do something wild and crazy just for fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] confusing (postponing, suggestions)","postDate":"1159280451","msgId":17599,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOEFGOEUxQTk3NDc1OC1GNUMtMUZDQFdFQk1BSUwtREMwOC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQzOTg4M0RFLUZCQ0UtNDE5Qi04QUU3LTJCMjlCRjNBQzMwREBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGVmMjE0YytoMDU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NjE4NEY4OTMtQTYxMi00NzA0LUFDODMtM0MyMEU3RTQ3NDQ0QGdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDhDOEFGMzFFNkRGQTFFMS1CNTAtMjE5MUBXRUJNQUlMLURDMjAuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+IDw0Mzk4ODNERS1GQkNFLTQxOUItOEFFNy0yQjI5QkYzQUMzMERAZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17598,"nextInTopic":17601,"prevInTime":17598,"nextInTime":17600,"topicId":17542,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I know that I have to &quot;do&quot; it (&quot;learning<br/>\nby doing&quot;) – but then I sometimes need to know HOW to do it. For<br/>\ninstance, the suggestions question – of course I have tried to do it<br/>\nall by myself for several weeks but I still don&#39;t get it, so I ask. I<br/>\ntry to keep in mind all the new things I know now and believe in, but<br/>\nsometimes I don&#39;t know how to &quot;do&quot; it. I have observed that the more<br/>\nI just do it, I internalize the new principles better then just by<br/>\nmemorizing or reading about it, obvious. But sometimes I need<br/>\nconcrete examples on how to do it – this might be examples of how you<br/>\nwould do it and somtimes concrete answers whether or not something is<br/>\n&quot;allowed&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never considered *things&#39;* being &quot;allowed&quot; or &quot;not allowed&quot; in <br/>\nunschooling---more of what&#39;s the better option at the time. Trust and <br/>\nrespect and patience, on the other hand, are kind of requirements! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you get the feeling from us that some things are &quot;allowed&quot; or not? <br/>\nLike what? And who would have the authority to allow it?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah it is really confusing – it is actually both, difficult AND<br/>\nconfusing, and then again even more difficult because of the<br/>\nconfusions. For instance, the recent post  of Talia (taliasafa) is<br/>\nvery confusing: I find (no offense, Talia, and maybe I&#39;m wrong!),<br/>\nthat what she&#39;s doing is quite manipulative and I thought that these<br/>\nthings are exactly what we are not &quot;allowed&quot; to do, what unschoolers<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do, and then I&#39;m huh?? I thought.... Just when I thought &quot;I<br/>\ngot it&quot;, someone will write something that completely confuses me –<br/>\nand sometimes I also get confused when I try to implement the ideas<br/>\nof unschooling in real life and I get stuck in loops.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are newer and give advice---maybe not *contrary* to what I <br/>\nwould give, but not exactly on the money---or not what I consider the <br/>\n*best* option. If things are hectic here (and these past few weeks, the <br/>\nconference was in Albuquerque---a lot of us were travelling), sometimes <br/>\nit just floats out there without being questioned. Mostly <br/>\nthough---something not quite there yet WILL get questioned and <br/>\nquestioned aand questioned! &lt;G&gt; I don&#39;t remember Talia&#39;s suggestion. <br/>\nSorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter. What do YOU think would have been the best course of <br/>\naction? Do you not think you handled it well? What could *you* have <br/>\ndone better? Do you have any more tools in your toolbox?<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it kind of funny that you&#39;re struggling so much with this. You <br/>\nseem to have really grasped the concept---I mean REALLY grasped it! <br/>\nMore than most people new to this---AND considering your Teutonic <br/>\nheritage! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Like hm, she&#39;s<br/>\nwatching TV right now. She&#39;s actually watching TV all day. When would<br/>\nbe the right moment to suggest other things to do? should I suggest<br/>\nanything at all, she&#39;s happily watching TV all day, why should I<br/>\ninterrupt her? But maybe she&#39;s just watching tv for lack of better<br/>\nthings to do! But TV isn&#39;t bad, so nothing is &quot;better&quot;. Ok, then I<br/>\nshould suggest something. I suggest something, she doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>\nHm – but maybe she wants to do something else. Should I suggest<br/>\nanother thing? But then I interrupt again. But maybe she needs more<br/>\nimput! and so on and on – I find it confusing that on the one hand I<br/>\nwant to allow her to watch TV whenever and all the time she wants and<br/>\non the other hand I want to do things with her, but have no real<br/>\nspace to tell her because she is watching all day and I don&#39;t quite<br/>\nknow when to suggest anything and if I should suggest just one thing<br/>\nor more or just leave her alone until she&#39;s bored even if this means<br/>\nin five months. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Cameron first came home from school, I would had had to have set <br/>\nfire to the house to get him to do anything other than watch tv or play <br/>\non the computer. He had NO interest in anything else. Now he&#39;s too busy <br/>\nto join me in almost anything---we struggle to get time together any <br/>\nmore! Duncan hasn&#39;t needed that because he was never in school, but to <br/>\nget Duncan to do *anything* all I have to do it go do it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe loves to bake, so I&#39;ll set the ingredients out the night before to <br/>\nget to room temperature. That way he knows we&#39;ll be making a cake when <br/>\nhe wakes up the next morning. If I pull out the cards and art supplies, <br/>\nhe&#39;ll come in and join me at the table to make some ATCs. If I scatter <br/>\nbeads on the table, he&#39;ll join me as I string a few. If I start a <br/>\npuzzle, he&#39;ll inevitably find that piece I&#39;m been searching for for <br/>\nhours! &lt;G&gt; He&#39;s always up for a game of chess---which he always wins! <br/>\n(So far he still can&#39;t beat Ben. Cameron has recently won a few games <br/>\nagainst him---he read a book with some chess tips! I&#39;m a sure-fire <br/>\nloser! &lt;g&gt;) Sometimes we leave the TV on while we do these things; <br/>\nother times, we&#39;ll put a new or an long-lost CD in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I&#39;ll suggest a new movie---if I pop popcorn, he&#39;s THERE! The <br/>\nnight before, I&#39;ll often tell him I&#39;m going somewhere the next <br/>\nday---like to the library or Party City or the zoo. He always has the <br/>\noption of staying or going (he&#39;s ten and comfortable staying home <br/>\nalone). I can sweeten the pot by suggesting that we go out for lunch. <br/>\nOH! Stopping by the Korean market can *always* get him to join me. <br/>\nSometimes we buy all it takes to make sushi---sometimes we just get <br/>\nsome new ramen and those itty bitty yoghurts and Pocki candies.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh--and PAINT brings everyone out of the woodwork! Open a can of paint <br/>\nwith enough paint brushes, and everyone wants to paint a wall! &lt;G&gt; <br/>\nIsn&#39;t there a room in your house that could use a new paint job?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest mistake would be to be afraid of the TV. Make it your <br/>\nfriend too! While she&#39;s watching, sit next to her. Knit. Or rub her <br/>\nfeet while she&#39;s watching. Ask her questions about the characters <br/>\n(during a commercial or if you can pause the action with TiVo).<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions should be made the day before---or at a time when it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t appear that you are trying to pull her away. Maybe when you&#39;re <br/>\nin the car. But LOTS of things can be done *while* she&#39;s <br/>\nwatching---like the beads or ATCs or baking. *YOU* go DO them. She&#39;ll <br/>\nfollow you or not, but *you* should have a good time doing things *you* <br/>\nwant to do. Don&#39;t do them *for* her or because you want to pull her <br/>\n from the TV. Do them because *you* want to. She&#39;ll eventually feel your <br/>\nexcitement and join in.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just that I can&#39;t know if there might be some arguments for<br/>\n*not* doing something which I &quot;feel&quot; is right in that moment. So I<br/>\nwhen I asked if &quot;postponing is allowed&quot;, I asked if there were any<br/>\n(to me unknown) arguments against postponing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nPostponing things happens because we&#39;ve run out of time or because <br/>\nsomething else came up or because someone&#39;s not feeling well. Things <br/>\nget postponed all the time because of real reasons. I think as long as <br/>\nit&#39;s not arbitrary or punitive, it&#39;s just fine. It&#39;s a natural part of <br/>\nbeing---of doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you would have<br/>\nsaid oh nooo, we never ever postpone things because of X, and maybe<br/>\nthat X I just couldn&#39;t think of myself even though it seems obvious<br/>\nafter hearing about it – just as almost all of what unschooling is<br/>\nabout. Now I find everything so self evident and I feel like &quot;duh,<br/>\nwhy didn&#39;t I think of this before?&quot; &quot;how could I possibly think that<br/>\ncoercive methods could work even if I saw each day that they kinda<br/>\ndidn&#39;t?&quot; :-) But before, I couldn&#39;t think of these things and &quot;felt&quot;<br/>\nthat my methods were the &quot;best&quot; one can do.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as soon as you knew better, you started to DO better, right? &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nThe more you think about it, the less you&#39;ll &quot;need&quot; us! &lt;G&gt; It will ALL <br/>\nmake sense! After a while, when you see others make less than the best <br/>\nchoice (in your mind), you&#39;ll cringe! ANd you&#39;ll wonder why it&#39;s not so <br/>\nevident to them too! &lt;G&gt; That&#39;s just part of the growth and <br/>\nunderstanding.

Some other times  <br/>\nI cook or clean the house, which I both enjoy and can ask her to  <br/>\naccompany me, rarely I will do some &quot;gardening&quot; at our balcony, I&#39;ll  <br/>\nread something... but I will almost never ever do any handcrafting or  <br/>\npainting or sewing or knitting or baking cookies. So all the variety  <br/>\nof things you seem to be doing are things that I have to &quot;force&quot;  <br/>\nmyself to do in order to provide a &quot;I will bake cookies now wanna  <br/>\njoin?&quot;, to provide a wide spectrum of things one can do. Maybe you  <br/>\nthink &quot;get a life!&quot; but I quite like what I do and have absolutely no  <br/>\nproblem with it for myself, except for not being able to naturally  <br/>\nprovide a rich environment for my children. With my bf it&#39;s the same,  <br/>\nwe LOVE computers and internet and we use this medium for many things  <br/>\n(being creative, reading and writing, contacting people, organising  <br/>\nthings, working etc.) I used to think I was &quot;addicted&quot; to my computer  <br/>\nor to Internet, but all these texts about tv and video games not  <br/>\nbeing addictive for unschoolers I&#39;ve read have made me realize that  <br/>\nthis is just what I need, use and enjoy. Since we are unschooling we  <br/>\ndo ask her each (rare) time we stand up from it if she wants to join  <br/>\nus cooking/cleaning/playing/reading/bathing/going out – I just don&#39;t  <br/>\nknow if this is &quot;enough&quot;. We do sit with her while she watches TV  <br/>\n(sometimes with sometimes without our laptops) now and she plays with  <br/>\nher own computer right next to us in our &quot;office&quot; so we are always  <br/>\nthere to help and talk about it and someitmes play with her if she  <br/>\nwants.

And very <br/>\nlikely it won&#39;t look exactly like what works for my family. Here, an <br/>\nexample from our house:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a basic principle of being safe. For me, that means I have <br/>\nto really concentrate when I&#39;ve got a sharp knife at hand (I just <br/>\nhistorically have tended to get injured if I don&#39;t - I can even <br/>\nslice my hand open with nothing more than a frozen bagel!). For DS, <br/>\nhe chooses not to use certain knives so he knows he&#39;ll be safe. DH <br/>\ndoes just fine with even the big huge butcher knife, so we defer to <br/>\nhim when something (like a large watermelon) needs slicing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m saying is that there are basic principles of <br/>\nrespect and trust that are foundational to unschooling but how that <br/>\nlooks (and changes over time) will vary from relationship to <br/>\nrelationship. That&#39;s why you aren&#39;t getting concrete answers on what <br/>\nis &quot;allowed&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the original scenario (bf needs food, baby needs food, you <br/>\nneed food, picking up DD at 7 pm), I think I probably would have <br/>\njust eaten/fed everyone else BEFORE going out to pick up DD and <br/>\nprobably have toted along a water bottle and a snack mix for her<br/>\n(lately our favorite is a mix of pecans, raisins, and chocolate <br/>\nchips). That would have alleviated the urgent need for food part of <br/>\nthe equation. It also sounded like your bf needed you to get home to <br/>\nbe with the baby in order to head off for work (but maybe I&#39;m <br/>\nmisreading that). If that was the case, then I&#39;d probably have said <br/>\nsomething like &quot;I need to get home so bf can go to work but once we <br/>\npick up the baby, we could go to &lt;park nearer to home perhaps or <br/>\nplay in the yard or whatever&gt;&quot;. If there was no urgent need to head <br/>\nhome (keeping in mind I&#39;ve been fed and I have food available for <br/>\nDD), then yeah I might&#39;ve said okay to the playground and discussed <br/>\nen route that I&#39;d like to get home by 8:00 because I&#39;m starting to <br/>\nget tired (if that was true). <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the TV example, instead of interrupting, sit and watch until the <br/>\nend of the program and then say something like &quot;I&#39;m going to go make <br/>\ncookies - wanna help?&quot; and you might get a yes, maybe a no, maybe <br/>\na &quot;call me so I can lick the batter bowl&quot;, lol.

There is no central HQ that sets the <br/>\nrules for unschooling. &quot;Postponing&quot; can&#39;t be allowed or not allowed, <br/>\nwe don&#39;t make the rules for you. However, if spending 20 minutes <br/>\ntaking a walk was okay but 20 minutes at the playground isn&#39;t, then <br/>\nI might want to consider why that is.

For instance, the recent post  of Talia (taliasafa) is  <br/>\nvery confusing: I find (no offense, Talia, and maybe I&#39;m wrong!),  <br/>\nthat what she&#39;s doing is quite manipulative and I thought that these  <br/>\nthings are exactly what we are not &quot;allowed&quot; to do, what unschoolers  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do, and then I&#39;m huh?? I thought.... Just when I thought &quot;I  <br/>\ngot it&quot;, someone will write something that completely confuses me –  <br/>\nand sometimes I also get confused when I try to implement the ideas  <br/>\nof unschooling in real life and I get stuck in loops. Like hm, she&#39;s  <br/>\nwatching TV right now. She&#39;s actually watching TV all day. When would  <br/>\nbe the right moment to suggest other things to do? should I suggest  <br/>\nanything at all, she&#39;s happily watching TV all day, why should I  <br/>\ninterrupt her? But maybe she&#39;s just watching tv for lack of better  <br/>\nthings to do! But TV isn&#39;t bad, so nothing is &quot;better&quot;. Ok, then I  <br/>\nshould suggest something. I suggest something, she doesn&#39;t want to.  <br/>\nHm – but maybe she wants to do something else. Should I suggest  <br/>\nanother thing? But then I interrupt again. But maybe she needs more  <br/>\nimput! and so on and on – I find it confusing that on the one hand I  <br/>\nwant to allow her to watch TV whenever and all the time she wants and  <br/>\non the other hand I want to do things with her, but have no real  <br/>\nspace to tell her because she is watching all day and I don&#39;t quite  <br/>\nknow when to suggest anything and if I should suggest just one thing  <br/>\nor more or just leave her alone until she&#39;s bored even if this means  <br/>\nin five months. :-)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; We can give you examples of what has worked for us in a similar<br/>\n&gt; situation, but we&#39;re not you.

There is no list of<br/>\nunschooling &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;right and wrong&quot; to follow. There is a mindset<br/>\nthat you have to internalize in your very being and it takes time. I<br/>\nhate to say &quot;do what feels right&quot; because for some people, smacking<br/>\ntheir kids feels right!

The part about television took my kids almost a full year<br/>\n(for my oldest anyway...the younger ones had much less damage to undo)<br/>\nbut it is now just another option among many.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you can simply make the focus of your lives all about<br/>\nbringing joy and feeding the relationships, then all the rest becomes<br/>\nsecondary.

How much postponing is allowed? Sometimes she  <br/>\nwill suggest to do something at 10 pm and I&#39;m reaaally not up to it,  <br/>\ntired and everything. Is it ok to promise to do it another day, and/ <br/>\nor should I persuade her with good arguments why I wouldn&#39;t do it  <br/>\nnow? Real life example: I went to pick her up the other day from her  <br/>\nfriend&#39;s place, at 7 pm. We had plans for that evening and also my bf  <br/>\nhad to work and was waiting for me, we had not eaten yet, I had to  <br/>\ntake care of my son (1 yr) who also hadn&#39;t eaten yet and would be  <br/>\nhungry soon, and well other &quot;schoolish&quot; things I had in mind as well,  <br/>\nlike she has to get up early next day for school so we should start  <br/>\nto cook in time and such. At the car she suddenly suggested to walk  <br/>\nhome alone. I thought it was kind of late to walk alone – I told her  <br/>\nmy concerns but also said that if she was sure she could handle it,  <br/>\nshe could go. But then she changed her mind and wanted to go to the  <br/>\nplayground with me instead, but because of the above reasons I didn&#39;t  <br/>\nwant to and explained. I then offered to do it tomorrow or another  <br/>\nday and even asked if she had time next day and so on... she finally  <br/>\nagreed (not like the conversation was very long though) on going  <br/>\nhome, but not on doing it tomorrow, but she said &quot;hmmmmmmmm you  <br/>\nALWAYS have to persuade me... oookeeeeyyyy let&#39;s go *big sigh*&quot;,  <br/>\nthough not crying or lamenting all the time as she did before, when I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know yet that anything like unshcooling even existed. Do you  <br/>\nthink this was no respecting her? Is it allowed to say &quot;yes, tomorrow  <br/>\nwe can do that&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to follow the principles &quot;don&#39;t do anything you wouldn&#39;t want  <br/>\nto be done to you&quot; (and I wouldn&#39;t mind to be convinced by someone,  <br/>\nif it wasn&#39;t lies, so that one is ok, I thought), &quot;don&#39;t say anything  <br/>\njust to manipulate her&quot;, (and I didn&#39;t, I stated the true facts  -  <br/>\nbut then again, one could argue that since any argument is never said  <br/>\nwithout any intention (at least it is thrown out to give &quot;food for  <br/>\nthought&quot;, but mostly it is to convince someone or explain why you  <br/>\nchoose x or y), this is manipulative too!) and &quot;be respectful&quot; (and I  <br/>\nwas, I think, unless the act of not going to the playground was  <br/>\nalready disrespectfull).
