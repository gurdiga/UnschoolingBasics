Treat your kids kindly - in front of the other kids. Help them work out a problem - in front of the other kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I like the idea of making your house the fun house.

Make your home the place where fun things happen so the kids want to be there and there&#39;s plenty of things for everyone. That probably won&#39;t be something you&#39;re up for every day, but its something you can build: hold &quot;parties&quot; once a week to start - movie parties, make-up parties, lego parties, pokemon parties, littlest pets parties... whatever is interesting to the kids. And rather than &quot;supervising&quot; be involved in the fun as much as you possibly can so that you can steer dynamics before they get ugly. It&#39;s not a perfect solution, but then again there won&#39;t be One perfect solution, you need a set of tools to make things better, not a one-size-fits-all solution. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When our daughter plays with the neighbor girls she comes home acting<br/>\n&gt; differently than her usual sweet self:  her words are sarcastic and snotty<br/>\n&gt; and rude, lots of eye-rolling and door slamming.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Another tool is to separate your feelings from her behavior - its not about You, its about her decompressing from a very different environment. Be gentle and easy. Play along if you can - turn on your best tween self and roll with it, but kindly. Show her how you can be ironic and have attitude without being rotten and mean. If you need to draw a line, draw it at rotten and mean, not snotty and rude - be a grownup and have the grace she&#39;s momentarily lacking. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Pretty much every time they are over I have to<br/>\n&gt; intervene over some exclusionary thing <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, you don&#39;t have to do that at all - you can be sensitive to the fact that the girls don&#39;t want to play with the brother and youngest sister and do something with Them instead. Make it a special opportunity to connect with your kids so they feel warm and special and wanted *without* foisting them on the girls. That&#39;s kinder to All of them - its just as ugly to have someone foisted on you as to be the foistee. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Neither of us likes it, and we&#39;ve talked to her about it being<br/>\n&gt; unkind and hurtful.

She wants connection, but can&#39;t get the connection she wants when she&#39;s &quot;playing by the rules&quot; and &quot;being nice&quot;. Help her change the rules. Rather than run her down when she&#39;s unkind, be the kinder one, help her find more options so she has better choices to make. Realize that every time you&#39;re dismissive of her behavior you&#39;re showing her how to be dismissive of others. I&#39;m not saying to overlook it when she&#39;s obnoxious, but be sensitive to the fact that she&#39;s trying to get her needs met but can&#39;t figure out how to do that any better way than what she&#39;s doing right now. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209361242,"authorName":"JJ","from":"&quot;JJ&quot; &lt;jrossedd@...&gt;","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Social growth","postDate":"1307836293","msgId":46860,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGl0MHYyNSs0cWdzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGltTVJRMjRpaGV1eWFHZDBiPWlWWkxrVnljV1VnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46859,"nextInTopic":46861,"prevInTime":46859,"nextInTime":46861,"topicId":46856,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Quite so.

The other alternative seems<br/>\nto be that either Ryan or I supervise when they play.  The kids don&#39;t like<br/>\nthis though - they want to run free around the neighborhood.  Or we could<br/>\njust let the chips fall - we let her know when her behavior is unkind, and<br/>\nif she treats her friends this way they probably aren&#39;t going to be friends<br/>\nwith her anymore.  I don&#39;t want to see that happen either.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure we&#39;re not the only ones who have had to go through guiding their<br/>\nchildren on appropriate social behavior, helping them grow in positive ways.<br/>\nWhat can we do to help encourage our daughter to be kind to others besides<br/>\ncontinuing to be kind ourselves?  Do we ban them from playing with kids who<br/>\nhave negative influence over their behavior?  Continue to point it out?<br/>\nSupervise?  Make a plan to spend a lot more time with other unschooling<br/>\nfamilies so our kids don&#39;t feel left out if we don&#39;t let them play with the<br/>\nneighbors?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any thoughts/suggestions - this is pretty long and I&#39;m not sure<br/>\nI&#39;ve completely captured the scenario so feel free to ask questions.  Both<br/>\nRyan and I were pretty geeky and shy growing up and so don&#39;t have a lot of<br/>\npositive social experience from our childhoods to draw on.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-Renee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46806,"nextTopicId":46863}}
