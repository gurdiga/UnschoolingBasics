This isn&#39;t by<br/>\nchoice, it&#39;s just the way things are. We live in a 650<br/>\nsquare foot, one bedroom house. Dh and I sleep on a<br/>\nMurphy bed in the living room and the kids share the<br/>\nonly bedroom. A couple of years ago we built loft beds<br/>\nfor them. With them on opposite sides of the room, her<br/>\nhalf flowery and pink, his... well... boy messy with<br/>\nbuy stuff hanging everywhere. They have their own<br/>\nprivate spaces and they use the floor space between<br/>\nthem as shared play space. We have a plan for<br/>\nseparating the room in half with sliders so they can<br/>\nhave privacy yet open for when they want to play<br/>\ntogether on the open floor. I have been collecting the<br/>\ndoors from Craigslist but they aren&#39;t interested in<br/>\nputting them up. I&#39;m sure there are lots of people out<br/>\nthere who think their sharing a room is awful and I<br/>\ngenerally do not share that information with people<br/>\nfor fear of their reaction. I would love for them to<br/>\neach have their own room because I always wanted my<br/>\nown room when I was a kid, but no one is unhappy with<br/>\nthe way things are. In actuality, they revel in their<br/>\ntogetherness. He puts up with her singing half the<br/>\nnight and she never complains when he has the light on<br/>\nto read. And they laugh, be prepared, they laugh<br/>\nLOTS!!! It works for us. Personally, I think your kids<br/>\nhave a great plan and when they are ready for more<br/>\nprivacy and want their own rooms back they will tell<br/>\nyou.
