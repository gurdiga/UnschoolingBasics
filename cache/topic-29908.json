It&#39;s important to my husband that our son learn and stay <br/>\ncurrent with what a &quot;typical 5th grader&quot; is learning in the schools. <br/>\nHe comes from a strong collegiate background, and his point is that <br/>\nhe wants us to approach education so that our son will be able to get <br/>\ninto the college of his choice someday, if he chooses. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other big challenge is ME!  I feel like I need to present <br/>\nlearning in more creative ways to our son.

School does damage - even to kids who","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-408290488\">Age matters, but not in ways you might think.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere IS going to be some healing that has to take place in an older  <br/>\nchild. School does damage - even to kids who are seemingly successful  <br/>\nin school and even more so in kids who have had negative schooling  <br/>\nexperiences. So you have to expect to be patient, there can be some  <br/>\nnegative stuff that comes up in the first year or so after getting  <br/>\nthem out of school. It might sort of break your heart, but if you  <br/>\nexpect it, you can recognize it and be prepared to handle it with  <br/>\nequanimity. I&#39;m talking about things like a child who just stops  <br/>\nreading altogether - doesn&#39;t pick up a book on their own, for example.  <br/>\nParents will come here and say, &quot;At least when he was in school he did  <br/>\nread. Now he just wants to play video games all day and night.&quot; Or,  <br/>\nthey&#39;ll complain that the kids fight too much or want to watch tv too  <br/>\nmuch, etc. Kids that never go to school and are not schooled at home,  <br/>\nnever have to go through the deschooling process.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, my oldest daughter was in school through 4th grade  <br/>\nand she&#39;s now 23. She says that taking her out of school was the most  <br/>\nempowering thing I could have done and that that experience made her  <br/>\nrealize that her life is HER life - that there is always a choice,  <br/>\nthat it is always up to her to be in charge of her own life. Up until  <br/>\nwe said, &quot;No more going to school,&quot; she says she felt like, as a kid,  <br/>\nher life path was not her own responsibility. And she has an awareness  <br/>\n- she KNOWS what we got her out of and she is extremely grateful and  <br/>\nappreciative. In other words, there can be more conscious awareness of  <br/>\nwhat they&#39;re getting with unschooling, and that&#39;s kind of nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are most definitely some things the schooled kids have to  <br/>\nunlearn, though, and it takes time and experience. For example,  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve usually got the idea that learning only happens when they do  <br/>\nlessons. They often think learning only counts if it is &quot;hard.&quot; Or if  <br/>\nit is tested and graded.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can help to give them some input about unschooling, if they are at  <br/>\nall interested. Teens might want to read the first half of Grace  <br/>\nLlewelyn&#39;s book, &quot;The Teen-Age Liberation Handbook.&quot; (The second half  <br/>\nis more of a reference - ways to learn things they might want to learn  <br/>\n- great ideas.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBe aware that they might have weird ideas about why you&#39;re unschooling  <br/>\n- I&#39;ve heard lots of people say they found out later that the kids  <br/>\nthought they were not smart enough for school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, be really sensitive to their concerns - make sure they have  <br/>\nplenty of chance to let you know what they are worried about. Take the  <br/>\nconcerns seriously even when you know that the things they&#39;re worried  <br/>\nabout won&#39;t end up to be a problem. If a kid says he&#39;s worried he  <br/>\nwon&#39;t ever be able to go to college, respond with real information,  <br/>\ndon&#39;t just brush it off saying, &quot;Oh, you will, don&#39;t worry.&quot; Social  <br/>\nconcerns are common - take those serously, too - don&#39;t brush them  <br/>\naside. Make a calendar, set dates for getting together with friends,  <br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, finally, what other option do you really have? If you&#39;ve come to  <br/>\nrealize that schooling is harmful, are you going to leave them in just  <br/>\nbecause you didn&#39;t figure that out sooner? Get them out before there  <br/>\nis more harm done.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, to reassure you, some of the most awesome unschooled teens and  <br/>\nyoung adults I know were kids who were taken out of school in later  <br/>\nchildhood or in their teens. You&#39;re setting them free - how can that  <br/>\npossibly not be a good thing?<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 17, 2008, at 2:39 PM, katherinesaund wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Like Beth, (her message was: Does age matter when moving into<br/>\n&gt; unschooling lifestyle?), any insight, ideas, and wisdom that can be<br/>\n&gt; shared relative to beginning the unschooling journey with a child at<br/>\n&gt; 10 and above would be so helpful to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":318609587,"authorName":"katherinesaund","from":"&quot;katherinesaund&quot; &lt;ksaund@...&gt;","profile":"katherinesaund","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Note from a moderator","postDate":"1203287974","msgId":29925,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZwYWQzNitubWNoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNmYwMWM4NzE5MSQxZjdlMGJkMCQwMjAxYThjMEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4="},"prevInTopic":29908,"nextInTopic":29928,"prevInTime":29924,"nextInTime":29926,"topicId":29908,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you, Deb.
