I didn&#39;t want to<br/>\nexpose the boys to standardized testing at 6 years old.  When we moved to<br/>\nWV, the rules here aren&#39;t terribly different (though here, parents are not<br/>\nallowed to administer testing to their own child) and I found a friend of a<br/>\nneighbor who had met the boys at a party and was happy to review their<br/>\nportfolios.  She&#39;s very laid back and I actually keep my blog mainly for<br/>\nher, in lieu of putting together a binder every summer.  Very easy on the<br/>\nboys, easy on me, and we&#39;ve never had word from the school board.  Being on<br/>\nVaEclectic for a few years, I don&#39;t recall anyone reporting having a review<br/>\ncontested, but that might be a question to ask.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJenniffer in Harpers Ferry<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://octopigarden.blogspot.com\">http://octopigarden.blogspot.com</a><br/>\nListen, are you breathing just a little, and calling it a life? ~Mary Oliver<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 4/20/06, Kristie Cochran &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kristiecochran@...\">kristiecochran@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Ladies,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the info on Va Eclectic.
