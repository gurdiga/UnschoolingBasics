Do you all have any<br/>\nideas?  I was thinking about suggesting getting him like a<br/>\nmini-recorder and perhaps interviewing people on the street or set up<br/>\nrelaxed interviews (not suit, tie, etc.).  I want to help him because<br/>\nhe is so sincere in desiring to know this information but yet I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to scare him away from it, KWIM?  Maybe if I asked him if he&#39;d<br/>\nlike to interview someone we know first?  Maybe I shouldn&#39;t ask him at<br/>\nall and just let him keep it all in his head?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, a couple of the grandparents who lived in cities happen to be a<br/>\nbit on the prejudice side.  He really wants to know how they felt<br/>\nabout segregation, the fact is I already know.  I&#39;ve told him that if<br/>\nhe wants to delve in here that he&#39;ll have to keep in mind how people<br/>\nare raised and not to make judgements on the grandparents or any<br/>\nnegatives they may have had against black families rub off on him.  My<br/>\ndad, step-dad, MIL and FIL were raised in big cities where segregation<br/>\nand bussing were issues, I&#39;m almost worried but at the same time, in<br/>\nmy mind am trying to think of how you as unschoolers would think.  I&#39;m<br/>\nguessing that you believe Zak would be fine and that me not allowing<br/>\nthis questioning, if the grandparents agreed to questioning, would be<br/>\nsheltering him from life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m excited for him, just at a loss with creative ways to help him<br/>\npursue this interest.  Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy Winn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10998,"nextTopicId":10986}}
