Seems like this chapter may apply even if you  <br/>\nhad a blissful childhood and don&#39;t feel the need of self-examination.<br/>\nGordon Neufeld&#39;s book on attachment Hold onto your kids was pivotal  <br/>\nfor me, and I also bought (online) the audio of his presentation on  <br/>\ncounterwill.<br/>\nMy friend the therapist also recommended Daniel Hughes as an author  <br/>\nwho writes about ways to maximize your attachment(s) with children. I  <br/>\nhaven&#39;t read any of his stuff yet.  I see he has a new book coming out  <br/>\nthis fall Principles of Attachment-Focused Parenting: Effective  <br/>\nStrategies to Care for Children. His other books seem to focus mainly  <br/>\non traumatized and/or adopted/foster children. I may wait for the new  <br/>\nbook; I haven&#39;t decided.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;If you have a sling or patapum or something that might really help  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI second this comment on the sling. I try to wear my 6 month old dd as  <br/>\nmuch as possible. It does free me to play more with my two older  <br/>\nchildren than when I carrying her in my arms. One of the added  <br/>\nbenefits is my dh or MIL can wear her too, and it&#39;s a source of comfort.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kimberlee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa Gray","from":"Melissa Gray &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"graymamacita","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Breaking Mama/Son Bond","postDate":"1217946010","msgId":35139,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUyMkY5NEE1LTMyNEItNEJEQS05QUZGLUVBRkJCRTdFOEU0NUBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc3OTYwcys3YWRmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc3OTYwcys3YWRmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35137,"nextInTopic":35222,"prevInTime":35138,"nextInTime":35140,"topicId":35135,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Would you leave her for an hour? it doesn t have to be every day, but once a week take him to the grocery store.

I also have a 5ds and 11dd. I found shortly<br/>\nafter 10month dd was born ds5 felt rather rejected by me and acted in<br/>\nrejecting ways towards me and was very angry (I even wrote on here about his<br/>\nhitting). Fortunately we have reconnected and we are all good friends again.<br/>\nHowever, it took work. I had to regain his trust and &quot;prove&quot; that I loved<br/>\nhim, in his way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is all about papa so when dh comes home ds5 will usually get his<br/>\nattention first. After a while we &quot;trade&quot;. I take ds5 and papa takes dd10<br/>\nmon. We also take turns at ds5 bedtime (by this I mean when he is ready for<br/>\nbed) he generally wants a story or to play Pokemon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also use baby&#39;s nap time to read or play DS or chat with ds5. dd11 is<br/>\nusually still sleeping during the baby&#39;s morning nap. For a couple weeks I<br/>\njust rarely cleaned to make sure I was giving ds5 every moment I could.<br/>\nAfter a like while he would clean with me or do his own thing. He wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&quot;starved&quot; for attention. I realize it was my doing that undid us and that I<br/>\nneeded to make great efforts to repair it. I still didn&#39;t feel like I was<br/>\npaying my dd11 much attention, so I go and hang out with her several times a<br/>\nweek after both the smaller ones go to sleep. Its hard to stretch myself but<br/>\nworth it. I still give them all I have during the days but I had to<br/>\nconsiously carve out personal time with them. I just want to put it out<br/>\nthere that it took time and energy to regain that connection.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the weekends I will leave dd10mon with dh and take a small walk or<br/>\nsomething with one of my older kids. Or I can throw her in a backpack and<br/>\ngive most of my attention to ds5 or dd11 depending on what we are doing. If<br/>\nyou have a sling or patapum or something that might really help you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found it helpful to engage him on his level with his interests. I<br/>\nhave become quite the pokemon fan because of his interests. We read, play<br/>\nand watch pokemon together. I have learned all the ins and outs of it so I<br/>\ncan intelligently discuss it. With my dd11 I read many of the same books as<br/>\nshe does so we can talk about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took about 30 minutes to write this. I read and the played then wrote<br/>\nthen played then wrote then played. I built a castle, threw fratiles,<br/>\ncleaned up a set of toys to make room, helped ds findsomething, nursed the<br/>\nbaby, built the baby a tower or three to knock down, spun a wooden top<br/>\nrepeatedly...you get the idea. I didn&#39;t just sit here and do email. I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow if you have or have space for a playroom. It has been great since we<br/>\nmoved and have the space. It is set up baby safe and fun. SO I can play with<br/>\nds5 at the times the baby is occupied. My computer is up here so I also can<br/>\nget an email or two in every once and again. I can take 5 minute mini-breaks<br/>\nwithout the kids feeling like I even left.
