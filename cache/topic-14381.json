Let me tell you a little background.<br/>\n I had been a (non-certified) teacher in parochial school for about <br/>\n15 yrs.  My ds was having some anger management and emotional <br/>\nproblems so the school recommended I have him evaluated.  <br/>\nThe &quot;Doctor&quot; said he was disturbed and showed signs of trauma and <br/>\npsychosis!  He had never been traumatised by anything that I could <br/>\nthink of!  Well unless you count being accidentally left on the <br/>\nplayground at headstart or being accidentally locked in the bathroom <br/>\nand left there while everyone else in the class went outside - <br/>\nTWICE - once in kindergarten and again in 2nd grade!  I was floored -<br/>\n my sweet little boy? NO WAY!  So I tried to get the schools <br/>\nassistance with this!  What a waste of every one&#39;s time!  So, after <br/>\ndoing some research I decided to homeschool him.  With my teaching <br/>\nbackground I was the last person to think that homeschooling was a <br/>\ngood idea - I thought only extremist wackos did that! So, I withdrew <br/>\nhim from school and loved having him home so much that I soon <br/>\nwithdrew my dd. I took my now 12 yo ds out of PS a little over a <br/>\nyear ago, then a few months later my my 7 yo dd.  I still had one dd <br/>\nin HS (10th grade - she did not want to leave her friends). So, I <br/>\nleft her there.  Since then we have moved to another state and she <br/>\ndecided to hs. YAY!!!  I have looked into unschooling (obviously <br/>\nsince I am on this board) since the beginning but my husband is <br/>\nTOTALLY not into the whole idea of homeschooling.  I have had to <br/>\nfight every step of the way.  I even had to take them out of ps <br/>\nwithout his blessing (I don&#39;t ask permission for ANYTHING - lol!).  <br/>\nNeedless to say that was a rough patch to get through - but here we <br/>\nare none the less!  I tried the school at home thing for a while - <br/>\nmostly to please dh but when we we getting ready to move -  shucks - <br/>\nthere was just no time for &quot;school&quot;.  It has now been about 6 months <br/>\nsince the move and I just keep putting off school.  I keep finding <br/>\nexcuses to start. Thinking to myself that we will just stay like <br/>\nthis and lean more towards unschooling.  But - lately I have been <br/>\ngetting worried about my dd and going to college.  I talked to her <br/>\nabout it today and she says that she wants to go to college <br/>\nbecause &quot;she knows she should&quot;.  I told her that she didn&#39;t <br/>\nnecessarily have to if her interests took her elsewhere (and now I <br/>\nfeel like I am being selfish because I am almost trying to talk her <br/>\nout of it!).  She is very interested in art especially photography.  <br/>\nI am going to arrange that she volunteers at our local little <br/>\ntheater working behind the scenes (she says she is too shy for <br/>\nanything to do with acting).  When I told her about the opportunity <br/>\nshe was really enthusiastic about it and said she wanted to do it!  <br/>\nI know her attitude towards college comes from my dh. Who by the way <br/>\nhas two degrees and a certificate which aren&#39;t worth the paper they <br/>\nare printed on because he doesn&#39;t use them or the &quot;education&quot; they <br/>\ncame with in any way and never has.  But anyway, I am just so scared <br/>\nthat with only 2 years left (technically speaking), if I <br/>\ndon&#39;t &quot;school&quot; her she won&#39;t be able to get into art school or <br/>\ncollege at all.  Get ready for this! ------ I have been looking into <br/>\ngetting a unit studies curriculum to begin in the fall.  I am so <br/>\nconfused right now from reading so much info that my head is <br/>\nspinning.  <br/>\nThen I read your post!<br/>\n  Thank you for your analogy  - I was moved to tears because I <br/>\nreally do feel exactly that way inside but these superficial fears <br/>\nand of course my husband breathing schooling down my neck are about <br/>\nto drive me insane!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and by the way - my son is no longer &quot;psychotic&quot;, &quot;angry&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;disturbed&quot; in any way!(in my eyes never was) I believe <br/>\nwholeheartedly it was the school which made him act like he was!  <br/>\nTemporary insanity if you will - brought on by a system which was <br/>\nstifling and oppressive.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so there you have it.  So sorry for such a long post but it has <br/>\nbeen a long time coming!  Thanks to all who have listened.

She is majoring in recreation and leisure  <br/>\nstudies - her dream is to run a fine arts/outdoor life camp that  <br/>\nhelps people engage in deep self-examination into their own passions  <br/>\nand their place in creating social justice in the world. She  <br/>\nabsolutely totally thoroughly LOVES what she is doing. It is a  <br/>\nperfect fit for her and it has already opened up many many  <br/>\nopportunities. She&#39;s a dreamer, clearly, but here she is taking  <br/>\ncourses in everything from child development, outdoor skills,  <br/>\nenvironmental issues, financial management, grant writing, research  <br/>\nmethods, facility design, and administration, so her dreaming is not  <br/>\nidle head in the clouds - but is being grounded in real skills and  <br/>\nknowledge. She sees her college courses as a fantastic opportunity to  <br/>\nsqueeze every bit of useful knowledge and information out of her  <br/>\nprofessors, to help further her own goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 21 she has a passion - a dream - AND she&#39;s working in concrete  <br/>\nways toward that dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 21 I was drifting along, going to school for lack of knowing what  <br/>\nelse to do.

I&#39;ve known people with a similar story to yours.  My <br/>\nstory is a bit different.  My mom did not encourage me to go to <br/>\ncollege.  She believed that college was for wealthy people and she <br/>\nflat out told me I couldn&#39;t go.  I graduated high school a semester <br/>\nearlier than everyone else because I got a job, got a car, <br/>\ninsurance, and moved into a new apartment with my mom so we could be <br/>\nroommates and share the rent and utilities.  Then she encouraged me <br/>\nto get married as quickly as possible and then nagged me about <br/>\ngrandchildren because she believed that ALL women really wanted to <br/>\njust be married and have kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny thing is that my husband decided to finish his Bachelor&#39;s <br/>\nDegree and we moved to a college town.  I got a clerical job on <br/>\ncampus and after working there for about a year, I realized that the <br/>\nstudents were not special like my mom told me.  I realized I could <br/>\nactually go to college.  I had my husband&#39;s support as long as we <br/>\ncould manage.  That meant that anytime we got really low on money or <br/>\nbehind in payments, I had to quit shool and go back to work full-<br/>\ntime while he continued on to graduate school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLong story short -- that marriage didn&#39;t survive and I never did <br/>\nearn a college degree.  After I was divorced, I asked my mom why she <br/>\npushed me into marriage at such a young age and she said she grew up <br/>\nbelieving a girl needed a husband to make her happy and support <br/>\nher.  But my mom was divorced when I was 4 yrs. old and didn&#39;t <br/>\nremarry until I was 30 years old!  *lol*  She was doing fine on her <br/>\nown but she wasn&#39;t happy about it.

I am about one year ahead of you.  I was in the exact same place a <br/>\nyear ago with my then 12 yo nephew who had just moved in with us (april <br/>\nof 2005).  He had attended public school since Kindergarten. &quot;Failing&quot; <br/>\nmiserably by the school&#39;s standards.  He would completely shut down when <br/>\nit came to any and all of the following (even if the word was just <br/>\nmentioned his body would get all tight and defensive): homework, school, <br/>\nlearning, reading, tests, studying, etc.  He would continually say, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nDumb!  I hate (fill in the blank)!&quot;  He would hunch over and cry.  We <br/>\nwould try to reassure him but to no avail.  I was planning on <br/>\nhomeschooling my own children so I figured I may as well &quot;teach&quot; him at <br/>\nhome too because that was my plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily, I had the common sense to see that teaching at home would just <br/>\nreplicate all the pointless busywork that he absolutely hated from <br/>\nschool except now it would be my job to make sure he did it.  And I <br/>\ncould easily see that I would never get anywhere.  I wanted him to do it <br/>\nhimself, to read, to learn, to strive to better himself.  I wanted him <br/>\nto enjoy his life, be happy and feel successful.  That was the real goal <br/>\n- in my mind anyway.  The schoolwork was just a means to the end.  <br/>\nMemorize your multiplication table, get a happy life.  But his life <br/>\nwasn&#39;t happy right now and I could really see that the very act of <br/>\nforcing him to learn was actually guaranteeing that he would never get a <br/>\nhappy life.  So for all my good intentions, I was doing the exact <br/>\nopposite of what he needed me to do.  I had to let go - let go of my <br/>\nfears for the future, let go of my fears of what others may think, let <br/>\ngo of trying to control him in an effort to avoid what I feared.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent the summer reading everything I could get my hands on.  All the <br/>\nbooks everyone has already recommended.  I had to dismantle the whole <br/>\nlearning paradigm that was in my mind.  Everything that I had never even <br/>\nquestioned before like &quot;You have to get a diploma&quot; or &quot;You have to read <br/>\non your own by age 6&quot; or &quot;You have to follow a curriculum&quot;.  All that <br/>\nschool stuff.  I had to look at it with fresh eyes and use my own <br/>\nexperience, and the books, and other people to debunk all of that <br/>\ngarbage.  Because that is what it was: garbage filling up my mind and <br/>\nkeeping me from seeing the real learning that was happening.  There is <br/>\nplenty of evidence that none of this stuff is true but you have to be <br/>\nwilling to accept that reality before you can move forward.  It is <br/>\nharder than you think!  Because what does it mean if it isn&#39;t true?  <br/>\nThat I just spent my whole life investing in a system that was <br/>\nabsolutely false?  That every &quot;A&quot; I received in school was meaningless?  <br/>\nAnd that I could have been so much more and better if I had been just <br/>\nleft alone?  There is a lot of anger that comes with acknowledging the <br/>\ntruth because that means that all of us (except of course those who were <br/>\nunschooled) are victims of an awful, mind-debilating system that robs us <br/>\nof our natural birthright and keeps us imprisoned through guilt, shame, <br/>\nfear and doubt.  Are you ready to break out of that box?  Every fear you <br/>\nhave needs to be dismantled and only you can do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo take the summer off.  Even with your fears intact, you can do this.  <br/>\nLuke is on summer break and, just like every other kid in America, he <br/>\nshould not be expected to accomplish/learn/do school during the summer.  <br/>\nEverytime a fear pops up and you want to make him do something, say to <br/>\nyourself, &quot;He is on break!&quot;  Don&#39;t do anything for three months!  Just <br/>\nenjoy yourself.  Enjoy him. Do whats fun, follow your heart not your fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you have an assignment: READ, READ, READ.  Start with the books that <br/>\ndismantle formal learning such as Gatto, Llewellyn, Smith and Holt.  <br/>\nThen dive into the unschooling books: Mckee, Kream, Fitzenreiter.  And <br/>\nwrite down every fear you have and then research, research, research.  <br/>\nHow much of your own schooling do you use in your own life?  How many <br/>\npeople can you find who are successful despite not being successful in <br/>\nschool stuff?  Challenge all those preconceptions, dismantle them and <br/>\nfind the truth.  That is your job and no one, not even the good people <br/>\non this board, can do it for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd back to my nephew:  He wouldn&#39;t read anything for himself but he <br/>\nloved for me to read out loud to him.  so I did.  And I did.  And I <br/>\ndid.  I have now read 15 novels outloud to him.  Sometimes I would read <br/>\nfor 4 hours straight.  He loved it!  I loved it!  We shared something so <br/>\nspecial with that.  I often thought, &quot;How will he get better at reading <br/>\nwithout actually reading?&quot;  But I kept that to myself and figured time <br/>\nwould tell.  Well, I still read outloud to him - just because it is <br/>\nsomething we enjoy together.  But he now spend hours studying his D&D <br/>\nmanuals.  If I was stuck in school mindset, I would not have seen the <br/>\nvalue in this but now I am just happy to see him happy and doing <br/>\nsomething he loves.  And then lo, and behold, he went and wrote a <br/>\nnovella and is now working on a second one.  Who would have guessed <br/>\nthat???  If I had continued to focus on what he was *not* doing and had <br/>\ntried to force him do things that I thought he *should* be doing, I <br/>\nwould have taken away his oppurtunity to many other things, such as <br/>\nwriting a book.  Luke may never write a book but I can guarantee you <br/>\nthat by worrying about and taking up his time with things he dislikes <br/>\ndoing, you are actually preventing him from finding what he loves.  By <br/>\ntrying to keep his so-called opportunities open through schoolwork, you <br/>\nare actually narrowing them.  I know, it is counterintuitive but it is true.<br/>\n<br/>\n-alice<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Reading/ Research Skills","postDate":"1150055795","msgId":14401,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1M0E2QTIwLUM1NEMtNDk2NC1CQzg2LTk1N0UyNUE2MUYzQkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU2aG9mMys5bGcwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU2aG9mMys5bGcwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":14397,"nextInTopic":14407,"prevInTime":14400,"nextInTime":14402,"topicId":14381,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

(In fact  <br/>\nyou say he&#39;s already researching his own interests. Don&#39;t down play  <br/>\nthat just because he isn&#39;t researching something he would learn in  <br/>\nschool. The skills to find out the names of the newest Pokemon are  <br/>\n*exactly* the same as the skills to find out the natives of Jamaica.)  <br/>\n*The* most important thing -- in research and learning -- is wanting  <br/>\nthe information.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can help him learn how to suppress his desire to learn by  <br/>\npressuring him to do research in order to learn how to do research.  <br/>\nIn the process he&#39;ll learn how to do something that he won&#39;t want to  <br/>\ndo. Schools are infamous for forcing in information in a way that   <br/>\nmakes the subject so unpalatable that kids make sure they never come  <br/>\nin contact with a need to use that information or those skills. How  <br/>\nmany adults don&#39;t read for pleasure because they were pressured to  <br/>\nlearn to read &quot;at all costs&quot;? The cost, being, the desire to read!<br/>\n<br/>\nStop looking at the world of information and skills you want to get  <br/>\ninto  him. That&#39;s going to stop you from understanding how  <br/>\nunschooling works and you&#39;ll get in it&#39;s way.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about living life, and learning skills and information  <br/>\nas a side effect. Don&#39;t assume that because unschoolers aren&#39;t headed  <br/>\ndirectly towards something -- research, alphabet, math, writing ...  <br/>\n-- that it isn&#39;t important. We know it&#39;s so important, so integral to  <br/>\nliving that kids will learn it as a side effect of living because  <br/>\nthey have to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just don&#39;t have to teach it. My daughter picked up knowledge of  <br/>\nfractions as a side effect of wanting to cook. Fractions got used and  <br/>\nshe got better at them the more she cooked. She picked up percentages  <br/>\nas a side effect of video games (and art programs and sales and tips  <br/>\nand ....) It made no difference if she understood them completely as  <br/>\nshe played. It made no difference that she learned from playing Paper  <br/>\nMario or calculating something &quot;important and academic&quot; like sales  <br/>\ntax. Percentages work the same.) Her understanding of percentages  <br/>\ngrew as her understanding of the games grew. Side effect and yet  <br/>\nintegral and vital.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnglish is a much more useful means of communicating than crying and  <br/>\n*just by living life* kids pick English up effortlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning a language *because someone thinks you should* is very very  <br/>\nhard.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it goes with the skills taught in school. Having a great desire to  <br/>\ncommunicate with other kids, kids IM each other and as a side effect  <br/>\nlearn to type and learn to translate thoughts in their heads into  <br/>\nwords so that others can understand. Just because those skills are  <br/>\nlearned as a side effect doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re inconsequential.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re integral to what the child is trying to do. Kids just don&#39;t  <br/>\nhave to be competent at the skills before they start IMing and  <br/>\nemailing. It&#39;s the desire to IM and email that drives the kids to  <br/>\nkeep IMing and emailing.

I think you really have to go slowly here.  Take each moment,<br/>\nand try not to project too far into the future.  Think of him as<br/>\nhealing now.  Imagine if someone breaks their leg, they need to stay<br/>\noff it, depending on the kind of fracture it is, for as long as six or<br/>\neight weeks.  So, if you try to walk on it, it will seem impossible,<br/>\nand you might think to yourself, &quot;Hmmm.  How will I ever walk again on<br/>\nthis leg normally; it hurts so much.&quot;  But, you&#39;re healing now and<br/>\nyou&#39;re not supposed to try to walk on it.  After it has had a chance<br/>\nto heal properly, you can begin to put weight on it, and *eventually*<br/>\nyou can find yourself walking around as though it had never been broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s healing from his school experiences.  After he has had a chance<br/>\nto heal and regain his trust in his world, he&#39;ll be able to resume<br/>\nbeing the learning machine that he actually is.  Right now, he can&#39;t<br/>\ndo that.  So, my suggestion is not to worry so much about how he&#39;ll<br/>\ndevelop reading/researching skills in the future.  Just get him<br/>\nthrough this healing period so he can regain that part of himself that<br/>\nloves to read the dictionary for fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think I am irritating people here, but these are sincere <br/>\n&gt; questions....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Erin, I&#39;m truly impressed with your questions!
