I have an undiagnosed Aspie.  We are in the process of getting her diagnosed.  She SOOOO fits the criteria though.........Terrible Social Skills, Hand Flapping, Rages, Anxieties and Fixations, Sensory Processing Disorder, the list goes on and on.  Anyway my daughter is 6 and has Oh, so many issues we are dealing with right now.  She flies into rages where she kicks and punches the walls, screams bloody murder.......I&#39;m sure the neighbors will be calling the cops and or social services on us.  She can&#39;t control her impulses......etc. etc.  Now I know any number of parents also that say Oh, I can&#39;t deal with that, let the school system come up with a way to deal with that.  NO WAY!  I pulled my girls out of school in September and it&#39;s one of best darn decisions I ever made.  My daughter hated school......both of my daughters actually.  School put my daughter into sensory overload and she would come home after school and rage for two hours<br/>\n everyday.  She learns differently than other kids.  The school system was not going to honor that.  My daughter was expected to sit in a desk for long period.  That just did a number on her sensory issues.  Here at home she does not have to sit in a chair or desk.  Often she eats while standing at the table or writes in her journal while standing.  At school she was constantly in trouble, and for things I saw as non-issues.....but the school saw them as issues.  I remember her  coming home one day and saying she got in trouble because she was reading a book and would not put it down.  OK, I get that the class was moving onto something else, but OMG it was a big eye opener for me.  If my child wants to read for two hours why not?  My daughter was also bored to tears in school.  She was so far ahead of the other kids.  It just was not gonna work.  As far as classes/services/therapies etc. well that is up to each individual.  We will probably get Mariah some Occupational<br/>\n Therapy for her Sensory Issues.  She has had it in the past and it&#39;s helped a lot.  Other Therapies I am not sure yet.  Now I have a friend that is an adult aspie.  She to this day can&#39;t stand anything social.  If you think you are going to her house for a BBQ......no way.  But anyway she total functions in society.  She has worked for the US Government for 20 years.  She is extremely intelligent, has a advanced degree.  She has two kids (one of them an aspie) and a husband.  Her husband is kind of anti-social like her so it works out fine.  She is happy and life is fine.  Anyway my point to that is she tells me all the time about how school was pure hell for her.  College and beyond were fine, because then it was on her terms.  She sends her kids to an excellent private school for special needs kids, but she is strongly in favor of homeschooling.  So I love having the adult aspie perspective on this one.  So if you ask my opinion, Yes, an aspie can be homeschooled and/or<br/>\n Unschooled.  I love my daughter and I know I am doing the best thing for her.  She loves being home and she loves learning in freedom.  She&#39;s six, and just last night wrote a book about gardening with illustrations and all.  She did it because she wanted to and enjoyed it, not because it was being forced on her.  I am amazed at the wonderful things she does everyday.  I hope I&#39;ve eased your mind.  I think you are doing the right thing.<br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nthisismaggiesemailaddress &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thisismaggiesemailaddress@...\">thisismaggiesemailaddress@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Hi, <br/>\nIs there anyone out there unschooling a child with Asperger&#39;s <br/>\nsyndrome?

It sounds as if something is working right.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is it you feel he would be missing by going to traditional<br/>\nschools?  What do you think he would gain from such a venture?  Can<br/>\nyou meet his needs yourself?  Unfortunately, I have met many parents<br/>\nwho have the attitude of &quot;This is too hard for me so I am going to let<br/>\nsomeone else deal with this.&quot;  (This being their child.)  I ran into a<br/>\nhigh school friend the other day.  She is a local &quot;celebrity&quot; in that<br/>\nshe had a set of quints 11 years ago (they are the same age almost to<br/>\nthe day as my 11 year old.)  We chatted for a while as I watched her<br/>\nboys reading books and loving being in a bookstore.  She asked me what<br/>\ngrade the kids were in now and I said, &quot;Um, I don&#39;t know.  We<br/>\nhomeschool and I don&#39;t keep up with grades.&quot;  She then went on about<br/>\nhow hard it was to raise 5 children and how she was SO glad that there<br/>\nwas free public education so she didn&#39;t have to &quot;deal&quot; with her<br/>\nchildren all day and how she could never homeschool because her<br/>\nchildren are so vastly different with IQ&#39;s from 95 to 170 and it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be fair to homeschool them since the smart one would make the<br/>\nnot-so-smart one feel stupid all the time.  Yet she has her children<br/>\n(all age 11) in three different grade levels and in two different<br/>\nschools.  Yeah, that&#39;s fair.  All I could think about was how cool her<br/>\nkids are and how much fun it would be to set out on an adventure with<br/>\nthe five of them and explore the all the world had to offer.  All she<br/>\ncould see was work.  She thought I was &quot;wonderful&quot; to be able to<br/>\nhomeschool my three vastly different kids.  I just had to chuckle to<br/>\nmyself because she just didn&#39;t get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m betting your friend doesn&#39;t get it either.  The system has made<br/>\nraising a child with different needs seem more difficult than it is.<br/>\nI bet with some gentle parenting and some reevaluation as to what is<br/>\nimportant that the arguments and such would diminish greatly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: unschool an aspie?","postDate":"1163701657","msgId":18969,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVqaWFpcCtpOGw5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVqaTljZys4b2dhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18968,"nextInTopic":18970,"prevInTime":18968,"nextInTime":18970,"topicId":18968,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~My concern, is it ok to give such a child all the freedom I m giving him?
