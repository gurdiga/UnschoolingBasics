To many unconnected facts in school for<br/>\nme.  In CA, we are now in NM, I had to write down everything dd did.  I came<br/>\nacross so many problems trying to find how to categorize something.  For<br/>\ninstance...as you put it...wave motion..physics.  Do you or does anyone know<br/>\nof anywhere where this type of information is spelled out easily for me.<br/>\nKind of like you were so kind to do it below.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I do not need to do anything here in NM....but it&#39;s just<br/>\nsomething I want to know for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any input.<br/>\nCrystal<br/>\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; In a message dated 9/21/2005 5:07:11 P.M.
