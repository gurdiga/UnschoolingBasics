Working as an Au-Pair...<br/>\n<br/>\n... you pay your flight here and back yourself<br/>\n... you eat with the host family and have an own lockable room (has to  <br/>\nbe at least 8qm) in the family&#39;s home (both of which you don&#39;t have to  <br/>\npay)<br/>\n... you help with household whenever it is related with the kids<br/>\n... you help with the care of the kids, so the parents can work, also  <br/>\nyou babysit 1-2 times in the week if necessary<br/>\n... you don&#39;t work more than 6 hours a day and 30 hours a week  <br/>\n(babysitting included)<br/>\n... you get an allowance of 260 € per month, also during vacation<br/>\n... you have a vacation of 4 weeks if you stay 1 year, or else 2 days  <br/>\nper month if you stay less than a year (one has to stay at least 6  <br/>\nmonths, but we&#39;d like someone who stays a year if possible)<br/>\n... you pay your own language course (in Germany German), the host  <br/>\nfamily has to allow you time to go there<br/>\n... you have at least one free day in the week, at least one of those  <br/>\nin the month has to be a sunday<br/>\n... you&#39;d have a real contract. All the formalities would be taken  <br/>\ncare of by an agency (which we can choose together), normally, the  <br/>\ncontact making through the agency doesn&#39;t cost anything for the Au- <br/>\nPair (but for us).<br/>\n... the host family pays your health insurance, also an insurance for  <br/>\nthings you break or loose, and also in case you damage the kids or the  <br/>\nhost family in some way<br/>\n... the agency normally offers cheap city tours in Europe for the Au- <br/>\nPairs and meetings with other Au-Pairs (like Rome for 175 € I don&#39;t  <br/>\nknow how many days, though, I guess for the weekend)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAn Au-Pair does NOT:<br/>\n... clean up the whole house or wash underwear of the host family :)<br/>\n... take care of the kids the whole time<br/>\n... make ALL meals for the whole family<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest will have to be accorded between us (for example, how much  <br/>\ntime to spend on the phone, which kinds work to do in the household  <br/>\netc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can find a lot more information on the internet of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in Leipzig, which is a thriving city 2 car hours from Berlin.  <br/>\nWe&#39;ve got two kids now, 8 (she&#39;s in a school wich unschools,  <br/>\nunfortunately we can&#39;t fully unschool because it is illegal in  <br/>\nGermany, so it has to be in a building), and 2, a boy. I&#39;m pregnant  <br/>\nnow so there would be another one around end of May 2008. We both  <br/>\nparents work mostly at home so you wouldn&#39;t have to stay with the kids  <br/>\nthe whole day alone, but rather with us. We enjoy being with our kids  <br/>\nbut we also really do have to work, so this is the solution we&#39;ve come  <br/>\nup with :-) We don&#39;t know if you&#39;d also have to take care of the very  <br/>\nlittle one, this depends one how well he or she would accept you,  <br/>\nthough you could surely carry it around in a sling :-) We are NOT very  <br/>\ntidy and clean, rather messy. We don&#39;t smoke, and we wouldn&#39;t want  <br/>\nsomeone who smokes :-) We eat in parts organic food, but only what we  <br/>\ncan afford. My partner is vegetarian, the rest of the family is not,  <br/>\nwe eat a lot of fish and don&#39;t cook much meat because it&#39;s just too  <br/>\nmuch work to cook two dishes, but we wouldn&#39;t mind if you did cook  <br/>\nyour own meat. We have internet :-D and a WII and a (old) playstation.  <br/>\nWe do family activitites in the weekends and we especially have rather  <br/>\nlittle time to go out with the kids during weekdays, which is what  <br/>\nwe&#39;d expect you to do especially with the two year old (as long as he  <br/>\nwants to :-)). At nights we like to watch Star Trek or Seinfeld or  <br/>\nScrubs or Frasier or My name is Earl or The Office or anything like  <br/>\nthat in English, sometimes movies as well. We&#39;d be looking forward for  <br/>\nyour input in anything you&#39;d like to do here in Germany.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to speak German in Level A1 according to regulations. With us  <br/>\nand the kids you can speak English or Spanish if you feel more  <br/>\ncomfortable with (though  you&#39;d probably want to improve your German).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone can help us, thank you very much!<br/>\n<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGeflüstert wird nicht! - UNERZOGEN<br/>\nwww.unerzogen-magazin.de<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27463,"nextTopicId":27481}}
