DH and I <br/>\nhave really been having difficulties as far as conflicting parenting <br/>\nstyles - he was raised with &quot;the Fear of Dad&quot; if Dad says &quot;do this&quot; <br/>\nyou do it, if Dad says &quot;eat this&quot; you eat it, no questions, no <br/>\nnegotiation, all dissenters will be punished. Dad was the boss, <br/>\neverything went Dad&#39;s way. So now dh has a serious need to be &quot;in <br/>\ncharge&quot; Whenever a kid questions his authority he hits the roof! He <br/>\nsees all the problems as my fault, I am not running a tight enough <br/>\nship. And naturally with that idea planted in my head I feel totally <br/>\nconflicted and overwhelmed. I find myself trying to make my <br/>\nkids &quot;toe the line&quot; but I want them to be independent thinksers who <br/>\ncan make their own decisions. I hate being a mom who uses threats <br/>\nand guilt to get people to eat their vegetables or clean their room!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this is the case in your home, but it may be, and if your like me, you may not even be aware of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis very thing has been happening with us. Jason so gets unschooling, he got it before me, as long as it pertains to school. And he has no problem with food restriction, because he wasn&#39;t raised with any. But the rest, has been a battle between us for years. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were spankers, and yellers. I&#39;ve moved past spanking and I&#39;m trying to move past yelling. Jason is trying to let go of the spanking but is haveing a harder time with it than I am. He had pretty much gotten past it, until we moved. (A move that was for him to go to school-as per my request for a more finanical stable future-he was not interested in going to this school very much) Last week I started reading Wishcaft and something hit me that I honestly hadn&#39;t noticed before. <br/>\n<br/>\nJason isn&#39;t happy. He hasn&#39;t been happy in years. And his need to control the kids is directly related to his unhappiness. And the reason he isn&#39;t happy is me. I&#39;ve been forcing him to live a life that I keep thinking that I want and he, out of his love for me, is doing everything that I ask of him, even when it makes him misrable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started talking about this this weekend. And the more I can come to terms with my part in his unhappiness and we figure out what we need to do to help him find his happiness, he is starting to let go of his control. He&#39;s finding his way to let go of his control over the kids, as I let go of mine over him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may not have anything to do with you and your husband, but htis has been such a revalation to me, and sometihng that 2 weeks ago I never would have concidered, I wanted to share it with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand where you are, I&#39;ve been there, and just now starting to climb my way out of it.

This is VERY similar to what is being <br/>\ndiscussed on another thread, and it is EXACTLY what I am dealing with <br/>\nin my personal situation at home.  It is beyond frustrating!  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, I can offer no real advice at this time being that I&#39;m <br/>\nin the same exact situation myself.  All I can say is to be <br/>\npersistent.  I have tried the letter writing thing for communication <br/>\nthat was suggested previously by someone else.  I say it&#39;s worth a <br/>\nshot, but don&#39;t get your hopes up too high.  In my experience, <br/>\nsometimes it works a little, sometimes it doesn&#39;t work at all and <br/>\nother times it may make a difference temporarily and other times it <br/>\nmay make no difference at all.  In my personal experience it never <br/>\nmade a huge difference.  Everyone is different, so definately try it. <br/>\nIt is worth a shot. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt really is much easier to communicate on paper.  The difficulty <br/>\ncomes in when the other person doesn&#39;t like to write.  If nothing <br/>\nelse, it has the potential to be a good thought provoker and <br/>\nconversation starter.  I just wanted to caution you to not have your <br/>\nexpectations set real high.  In my experience, it&#39;s easier to go into <br/>\nit knowing that it may have little to no effect on the situation than <br/>\nit is to have these grand expectations, having it flop and facing <br/>\nmajor disappointment. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne other helpful bit, that you probably have figured out already <br/>\ngiven your situation, is to be aware of timing.  With your husband&#39;s <br/>\npersonality timing is everything.  Definately be aware of his day and <br/>\ncurrent mood before handing him a letter or starting up a serious <br/>\nconversation about the topic at hand.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s all of my wonderful wisdom and experience.  I really <br/>\nfeel for you and am right there with you.  If/when you learn anything <br/>\nalong the way please do share.

Now I need advice!! Here&#39;s <br/>\nmy story ...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is okay with us not &quot;doing school&quot; anymore. I have talked <br/>\nto him about throwing out the curriculum and providing our family <br/>\n(Mom and Dad included) with a rich environment to learn from, and <br/>\nwe&#39;re both on the same page with that. But to be quite honest, until <br/>\nthe food discussion started on this list I hadn&#39;t really thought <br/>\nabout how to incorporate the unschooling philosophy to our whole <br/>\nlife - thus far the only thing that we&#39;ve changed is I&#39;m not forcing <br/>\nthe kids to do math workbooks or write sentences, and I&#39;m not <br/>\nlooking for &quot;teachable moments&quot;. But in all other aspects of our <br/>\ndaily life not much has changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now that I look at the big picture I realize that all of <br/>\nour &quot;problems&quot; with the kids are really control issues. DH and I <br/>\nhave really been having difficulties as far as conflicting parenting <br/>\nstyles - he was raised with &quot;the Fear of Dad&quot; if Dad says &quot;do this&quot; <br/>\nyou do it, if Dad says &quot;eat this&quot; you eat it, no questions, no <br/>\nnegotiation, all dissenters will be punished. Dad was the boss, <br/>\neverything went Dad&#39;s way. So now dh has a serious need to be &quot;in <br/>\ncharge&quot; Whenever a kid questions his authority he hits the roof! He <br/>\nsees all the problems as my fault, I am not running a tight enough <br/>\nship. And naturally with that idea planted in my head I feel totally <br/>\nconflicted and overwhelmed. I find myself trying to make my <br/>\nkids &quot;toe the line&quot; but I want them to be independent thinksers who <br/>\ncan make their own decisions. I hate being a mom who uses threats <br/>\nand guilt to get people to eat their vegetables or clean their room! <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my house Mom and Dad tried to accomodate everyone&#39;s needs as much <br/>\nas possible - if Mom made lamb for dinner, she knew I didn&#39;t like <br/>\nit, so I got a PB&J sandwich instead. I honestly don&#39;t remember ever <br/>\nhaving conflicts with my parents about food, tv watching, room <br/>\ncleaning. After I had kids I asked my Mom how she did such a good <br/>\njob raising her kids, her answer: &quot;I led by example.&quot;  This sounds <br/>\nso simple, yet for me it is a very HUGE idea!<br/>\n<br/>\nI will admit that I have not always been the best example for my <br/>\nkids. I have yelled, I have spanked, I have even thrown temper <br/>\ntantrums! I don&#39;t make my bed everyday, sometimes I go to bed <br/>\nwithout brushing my teeth, sometimes I watch tv all day and eat too <br/>\nmuch junk food, I have been known to talk with my mouth full of <br/>\nfood... Dh has done all of these things too. So how can we expect <br/>\nour kids to be &quot;perfect&quot;? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo here&#39;s my problem... I understand that changes need to be made. <br/>\nThat we need to stop being dictators and be role models. We need to  <br/>\ncome up with more creative solutions to address everyone&#39;s needs <br/>\ninstead of making everyone conform to what Mom and Dad say <br/>\nis &quot;right&quot; and &quot;good&quot;. But how do I get my darling husband with his <br/>\nhumungous control issues to see this point? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any advice you might have,<br/>\nSarah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49900,"nextTopicId":49912}}
