This was our first and definitely not<br/>\nlast conference ever, though we&#39;ve been unschooling our dd her whole<br/>\nlife.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so glad! The conferences are life-changing!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOur reasons for going:<br/>\n1) My 12yo dd was contemplating going to school for the first time in<br/>\nher life.<br/>\n2) I had a really hard time explaining RUS to my dh.<br/>\n3) 15 yo stepson, who lives with his mother and is in school, just<br/>\nhappened to get suspended a few days before the conference so we<br/>\nbrought him with us to explore the option of unschooling. (We believe<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t just coincidence. He was meant to be there)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThings we came home with:<br/>\n1) dd is still comtemplating school, but has a new found sense of<br/>\npride in being an unschooler.  She understands that it means not being<br/>\njudged (at least by other unschoolers).  She has a real sense of<br/>\nbelonging with a group of kids that she really thinks are &quot;cool&quot;. (I<br/>\nthink they are too!)  One quote I liked of hers was &quot;Unschooled kids<br/>\nare all different, but schooled kids are the same&quot;.  She realized it<br/>\nwas a generalization, but I feel it was an accurate take on school and<br/>\nconformity. It was a lightbulb for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Thanks to Ren :) dd&#39;s favorite phrase all this week has been &quot;Yeah,<br/>\nMom,why not?&quot;   We haven&#39;t found a reason &quot;Why not&quot; for anything yet!<br/>\n<br/>\n3)DH completely agrees with unschooling.  He had so many &quot;wow&quot;<br/>\nmoments.  His main concern right now is his son, as he&#39;s at a critical<br/>\ntime in his life.  DH was so impressed and genuinely touched by the<br/>\nadvice and real concern he received from the other guys, especially.<br/>\nHe said after we left &quot;I miss them already&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIs he on Ben&#39;s dads&#39; list? They still keep in contact. They&#39;re nowhere <br/>\nnearly as busy as *this* list, but it&#39;s nice for them to keep in touch.<br/>\n<br/>\n--=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Stepson realized that he now has a choice, providing he&#39;s allowed<br/>\nto go to school after his hearing, which in itself is enormous<br/>\nempowerment.  He also realized that school shouldn&#39;t define him and<br/>\nall that goes with that knowledge.  He attended some of the talks with<br/>\nhis dad and liked Ben&#39;s &quot;Dad&quot; talk especially.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s very empowering to go to school when you know you have a choice!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n6)We all made connections with interesting, positive, passionate<br/>\npeople and are really hoping to go to NM.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was so worth the money spent.  Thanks you to the organizers. Thank<br/>\nyou to the speakers.  Thank you to everyone we had the true pleasure<br/>\nof meeting.  It was a life changing experience for all of us and I<br/>\nmean that with all sincerity.<br/>\n<br/>\n--=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to see you all again in NM!<br/>\n<br/>\nI know well how much work Kathryn put into this conference.

This was our first and definitely not<br/>\nlast conference ever, though we&#39;ve been unschooling our dd her whole<br/>\nlife.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur reasons for going:<br/>\n1) My 12yo dd was contemplating going to school for the first time in<br/>\nher life. <br/>\n2) I had a really hard time explaining RUS to my dh.<br/>\n3) 15 yo stepson, who lives with his mother and is in school, just<br/>\nhappened to get suspended a few days before the conference so we<br/>\nbrought him with us to explore the option of unschooling. (We believe<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t just coincidence. He was meant to be there)   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThings we came home with:<br/>\n1) dd is still comtemplating school, but has a new found sense of<br/>\npride in being an unschooler.  She understands that it means not being<br/>\njudged (at least by other unschoolers).  She has a real sense of<br/>\nbelonging with a group of kids that she really thinks are &quot;cool&quot;. (I<br/>\nthink they are too!)  One quote I liked of hers was &quot;Unschooled kids<br/>\nare all different, but schooled kids are the same&quot;.  She realized it<br/>\nwas a generalization, but I feel it was an accurate take on school and<br/>\nconformity. It was a lightbulb for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Thanks to Ren :) dd&#39;s favorite phrase all this week has been &quot;Yeah,<br/>\nMom,why not?&quot;   We haven&#39;t found a reason &quot;Why not&quot; for anything yet!<br/>\n<br/>\n3)DH completely agrees with unschooling.  He had so many &quot;wow&quot;<br/>\nmoments.  His main concern right now is his son, as he&#39;s at a critical<br/>\ntime in his life.  DH was so impressed and genuinely touched by the<br/>\nadvice and real concern he received from the other guys, especially. <br/>\nHe said after we left &quot;I miss them already&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Stepson realized that he now has a choice, providing he&#39;s allowed<br/>\nto go to school after his hearing, which in itself is enormous<br/>\nempowerment.  He also realized that school shouldn&#39;t define him and<br/>\nall that goes with that knowledge.  He attended some of the talks with<br/>\nhis dad and liked Ben&#39;s &quot;Dad&quot; talk especially.   <br/>\n   <br/>\n5) I learned that solar flares are one of the causes of the northern<br/>\nlights, which are like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen (but will someday) in<br/>\nAlaska. This only stuck with me because my stepson was doing a report<br/>\non solar flares as part of the school work he was missing while<br/>\nsuspended. True to Ren&#39;s &quot;Chocolate&quot; talk. Connections.<br/>\n<br/>\n6)We all made connections with interesting, positive, passionate<br/>\npeople and are really hoping to go to NM.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was so worth the money spent.  Thanks you to the organizers. Thank<br/>\nyou to the speakers.  Thank you to everyone we had the true pleasure<br/>\nof meeting.  It was a life changing experience for all of us and I<br/>\nmean that with all sincerity.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynne, Kevin, Sarra and Tyler.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Northeast Unschooling Conference","postDate":"1134678352","msgId":8379,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZiLjdlODU4OGMzLjMwZDMyYjUwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":7231,"nextInTopic":13937,"prevInTime":8378,"nextInTime":8380,"topicId":7231,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi folks!
