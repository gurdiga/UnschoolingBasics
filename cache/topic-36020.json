She had spent the weekend with Pa-Pa and well he curses like a drunken sailor. I got cut off, surprisingly enough by an off duty state policeman, as I was taking an exit towards our house. She let loose out the window. He flashed the blue lights and asked her to repeat what she had said. I was mortified. He probably never laughed so hard and told her she was right he was very stupid for what he did and apologized. Then looked at me and said that I needed to teach her not to say those things because of verbal assault. I started laughing and asked who would press charges against a 3 yr old. Apparently it would be mommy&#39;s fault because I should control everything that comes out of her mouth. I told him then I would have to control everything went in and all kids have to taste test stuff to determine its worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for phrases you will hear around our house, &quot;Einstien&quot; for those lacking in intelligence, &quot;shitfire and damnation&quot;, &quot;son of a bean bag buccaneer&quot;, tartar sauce, poopdeck, poppycock, we have discussed numerous times using appropriate words at appropriate times. Cursing still occurs and with daddy moving in next week, it will be interesting to see what new words the kids can learn this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, anyone within a 100 mile radius be forewarned spitting contests shall commence, daddy thinks it is an appropriate education for a young boy to know how and when to spit and distance counts. This among other things he would never have allowed his kids to do. Most of it is aimed at irritating mommy and daddy, which it doesn&#39;t.
