So I<br/>\n&gt; was just wondering if there was a push on to reverse the antiquated<br/>\n&gt; idea of school as we know it or a group actively promoting unschooling<br/>\n&gt; as a legitimate and legal way of &quot;educating&quot; a child?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you mean pushing to change the law to specifically support  <br/>\nunschooling - the answer is no. First, that would be a state-specific  <br/>\nendeavor. Second, it would largely be a waste of time given the  <br/>\ncurrent mood in this society to in the opposite direction - toward  <br/>\nmore standards and more testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you mean helping people learn about and understand unschooling, you  <br/>\nare talking to people who have devoted large amounts of their personal  <br/>\ntime to that endeavor through establishing unschooling groups, email  <br/>\nlists, websites, publications, blogs, conferences, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nNHEN does have a media presence and does a considerable amount of work  <br/>\ninforming journalists and, to some degree, legislators and other  <br/>\npublic officials about the diversity of homeschooling styles,  <br/>\nincluding unschooling. Our approach is to slowly get the idea across  <br/>\nto the public that learning can happen in a wide variety of different  <br/>\nways and that homeschooling is not only the stereotype of mom sitting  <br/>\nthe kids down at the kitchen table to do their workbooks. We&#39;ve had  <br/>\nsuccess in that there has been a very clear shift in news stories -  <br/>\nmany more articles about unschooling and a lot fewer articles that  <br/>\nmake ignorant assumptions about homeschooling. NHEN doesn&#39;t usually  <br/>\nget directly quoted in the articles, but we&#39;re almost always consulted  <br/>\nby journalists and we provide lots of background information and we  <br/>\nhelp journalists find real (and diverse) homeschoolers/unschoolers to  <br/>\ninterview.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany states have active state organizations that monitor proposed  <br/>\nlegislation and respond to it when they deem it appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA more direct involvement at the state level by a national  <br/>\norganization would not be welcomed by the inclusive state  <br/>\norganizations. The Christian organizations usually welcome HSLDA&#39;s  <br/>\ninvolvement, but HSLDA has caused lots of problems over the years by  <br/>\ngetting involved at the state level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":298762478,"authorName":"cocoandmia","from":"&quot;cocoandmia&quot; &lt;cristina-pertierra@...&gt;","profile":"cocoandmia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling PAC?","postDate":"1203533444","msgId":30104,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZwaHNxNCs1OHZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwMjIwMDkxNms3YmQ2YzM4Y3I1OGE4OWQzN2FjMTZhZWNjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30103,"nextInTopic":30106,"prevInTime":30103,"nextInTime":30105,"topicId":30061,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m in Florida as well, and I ve decided, for simplicity s sake, to enroll in an umbrella school.

Thus, if you run into a problem during an<br/>\naudit/investigation (whatever you want to call it) you&#39;ll have to find<br/>\nyour own representation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy reasons for using an umbrella school are in large part due to my<br/>\njaded view of the government and their employees, especially when it<br/>\ncomes to education.  In addition, I find it time consuming, and quite<br/>\nfrankly just don&#39;t want, to translate our lives into pigeon-holes of<br/>\n&quot;learning&quot; .  If I had to, I would.

Like an umbrella school? I <br/>\nknow a bunch of FL unschoolers who don&#39;t do what all you&#39;ve described. <br/>\nAny FL unschoolers want to chime in?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there was a group here in SC that worked HARD to push the laws <br/>\nto where we are now. They are always watch-dogging and sending us <br/>\nupdates whenever there&#39;s a new bill working its way through--both <br/>\npositive and negative for homeschoolers. Often they have rallies at the <br/>\nState House and send out petitions. But it&#39;s important to understand <br/>\n*exactly* what you&#39;re signing/supporting &#39;cause some of the time, it&#39;s <br/>\nthe Christian Right School-at-Homers (doh!) wanting *more* regulations, <br/>\ndisguised as &quot;good for homeschooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as for a national *unschooling* watchdog group---no, not that I <br/>\nknow of. Homeschooling is legal in all 50 states, so technically <br/>\nUNschooling is also legal in all 50 states.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do what *I* can to get the word out about unschooling as a good <br/>\noption (the best! &lt;g&gt;), and I hope that as it becomes more and more <br/>\npopular/common, it will just kind of smoothly float into mainstream. <br/>\nIt&#39;s gotten lots and lots of press recently---and GOOD press! Parents <br/>\nare getting more and more disillusioned with the school system and are <br/>\nlooking for options. Unschooling is looking better and better!<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to say that I wish there were a stock option on unschooling: <br/>\nhomeschooling has grown sooo much these last ten years, and within <br/>\nhomeschooling, unschooling is ZIPPING along! &lt;g&gt; If I could have bought <br/>\nstock when we first started, I would be one RICH bitch by now!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMore new features than ever.
