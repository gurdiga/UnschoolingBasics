I am Mary - wife to David and mother to Sadbh (pronouced like a five but with an s). We live in Ireland - and while I do know some unschoolers, none of them are radical unschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd (who will be 4 in March) is not that into leaving the house at the moment. I am running out of ideas of things to do and thought I would post and ask for your input. I am not very creative or innovative - we tend to bake, do jigsaws and colouring, free paint, free play with her dolls (though as I said in another post I struggle with this as all we play is hide and seek). We also watch DVD&#39;s and stuff on UTube like Donald Duck cartoons - we dont&#39; have a cable TV (for financial reasons). She is starting to get into playing games on the computer - we discovered Nick Jnr the other day and they have great Dora games which she is currently enjoying. She also plays games on my iPhone. Our internet connection is crap though and the games frequently freeze or just fail to connect which is very frustrating for her. We also read books and have a number of sticker books we can work with. She often gets bored though and I wonder if I am offering her enough - I am struggling to be in with her for days on end esp when the sun is shining outside (we had an awful summer here in Ireland - rain, rain more rain and the autumn/winter has actualy been sunny). I do work 10 days a month and I try to use this as my release and get outdoors on my breaks as much as I can so I am not putting Sadbh under pressure when I am home. <br/>\n<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42064,"nextTopicId":42083}}
