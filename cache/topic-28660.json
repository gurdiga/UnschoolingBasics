And he used to get overly excited and just spin out of <br/>\ncontrol. We came up with &quot;Beep Beep&quot; from Stephen King&#39;s _It_. When one <br/>\nof the character&#39;s has gone too far, his friends say &quot;Beep Beep&quot; to <br/>\nbring him down.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe say it quietly to Duncan, and that&#39;s his cue to understand he&#39;s <br/>\ngoing too far and needs to reel it in a bit. It doesn&#39;t embarrass  or <br/>\nfrustrate him &#39;cause he was part of the solution. It&#39;s just his cue, <br/>\nand he likes it because he doesn&#39;t want to bore others or get too out <br/>\nof control. He just needed help in these situations, and it seems to <br/>\nwork really, really well for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMore new features than ever.
