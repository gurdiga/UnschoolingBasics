I&#39;ve never pushed or <br/>\neven &quot;coaxed&quot; her to talk to strange adults. Once she&#39;s familiar <br/>\nwith the layout of a store, for example, she&#39;s happy to go off on <br/>\nher own, and she does speak to select store clerks who she&#39;s gotten <br/>\nfamiliar with, but cautiously.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis same kid, if brought to a play group will hang back for a <br/>\nwhile, staying close to me.

In adult social <br/>\nsituations she takes longer, but does essentially the same thing: <br/>\nshe observes from a place of &quot;safety&quot; and then all at once dives <br/>\ninto the scene. We went to a couple parties over T&#39;giving and I <br/>\ncould practically hear jaws dropping all around the room when <br/>\nthe &quot;shy kid&quot; suddenly turned into the life of the party. She just <br/>\nneeded to get comfortable first. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;d encourage you to consider the possibility that its not <br/>\na &quot;push&quot; your kids need, but some time to take in the environment <br/>\nand develop a personal understanding of the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also encourage you to compare the way your kids relate to other <br/>\nkids vs adults, to quiet kids vs boisterous kids, to animals vs <br/>\npeople and see what there is to see. There may be clues there to <br/>\ntheir inate abilities and sensitivities that you are missing due <br/>\nto &quot;pushing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Otherwise I&#39;d be doing everything for them in life and where does <br/>\n&gt;that lead?

Her &quot;shyness&quot; isn&#39;t preventing her from <br/>\nlearning. If anything, I would say it is the process *by which* she <br/>\nlearns.

IMO that  leads to kids who grow up not knowing how to<br/>\nfunction in society.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a big assumption which hasn&#39;t been true in our family at all. I<br/>\nthink the prevailing message in society is that you have to &quot;teach&quot;<br/>\nresponsibility, you have to &quot;make&quot; kids do certain things or they&#39;ll<br/>\njust become useless blobs. That&#39;s not showing a lot of trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll tell you where it really leads....it leads to confident, happy<br/>\nkids that have a very trusting relationship with their parents that<br/>\neventually grow into all of these things in their own time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning to converse with total strangers is something that makes a<br/>\nlot of young children nervous. GOOD! That&#39;s a natural way for them to<br/>\nstay SAFE! Why do parents feel a need to override their natural<br/>\ninstinct for safety?<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually they grow older and more confident and they won&#39;t think<br/>\ntwice about approaching people at the bookstore or library or<br/>\nwherever. In the mean time, I view my job as a companion, a<br/>\npartner....a willing adult that is here to help them get to what they<br/>\nwant and stay in their comfort zone. Even my very loud and intense 5<br/>\nyear old does not like to talk with people he doesn&#39;t know. That&#39;s<br/>\npart of his growing and learning...I trust that process.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, you can&#39;t separate different kinds of learning. Learning is<br/>\nlearning. Learning is best done with an adult that you can trust to<br/>\nhelp you get what you want. Learning unfolds best in an atmosphere of<br/>\ntrust and respect. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s respecful to make my child do <br/>\nthings they aren&#39;t comfortable doing.<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics]Talking to strangers was  I just watched the Dr. Phil show on Unschooling!","postDate":"1164622483","msgId":19335,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ0NDE3MEZGLTMzOEMtNDM3RS1BNzI4LTE4REM5MUE5NkMyRkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNWUwMWM3MTFiMCQ3OTcwMDgxMCQyYzk2NGQ0N0B2YWxlcmlldTd3czZ5Zj4=","referencesHeader":"PDY2NjkzMC42NTQyNy5xbUB3ZWIzMTQxMC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDwwMDBjMDFjNzExMGEkZTQ3N2NjNzAkMmM5NjRkNDdAdmFsZXJpZXU3d3M2eWY+IDwwMDgwMDFjNzExNjEkOGNiZmZhMDAkMDFmZWE4YzBAc3F1aWQ+IDwwMDVlMDFjNzExYjAkNzk3MDA4MTAkMmM5NjRkNDdAdmFsZXJpZXU3d3M2eWY+"},"prevInTopic":19333,"nextInTopic":19347,"prevInTime":19334,"nextInTime":19336,"topicId":19308,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If you don&#39;t get your <br/>\nkids to go the counter and asks for books from the librarian you will be <br/>\ndoing everything for them in life? Simon and Linnaea have shy days. I have <br/>\nshy days. Actually, they are both more likely to go to the counter to ask <br/>\nfor help than I am. I am getting better at asking for help by watching them. <br/>\nBut I have never pushed them to ask for help, or made them go talk to a <br/>\nstranger when they didn&#39;t want to. In my experience, letting them decide <br/>\nwhen they were ready  to do something, and never holding them to that <br/>\nreadiness--so if Linnaea doesn&#39;t want to go find something out this time, <br/>\nwell, I&#39;ll go do it--means that when they are ready they don&#39;t have any <br/>\nweird feelings associated with something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, I hate doing it. And I probably hate doing it because I was forced to <br/>\ndo it. Because if I didn&#39;t do it how would I know how to function in <br/>\nsociety? It makes me feel stupid and obvious. It makes me feel like everyone <br/>\nis looking at me. And if I let that feeling build, if it takes me a while to <br/>\napproach someone for help, than I feel more and more embarrassed and more <br/>\nlike I did when I was little, a big butterfly filled stomach and a slight <br/>\nechoing sound in my ears. And it doesn&#39;t make me feel less like a hermit to <br/>\npush through that fear and embarrassment. It just makes it feel more so the <br/>\nnext time. But if I don&#39;t have to deal with it in that moment of <br/>\nfearfulness, well, it is so much easier the next time, when I&#39;m not feeling <br/>\nbad or tired or whatever made me more vulnerable the first time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think by pushing your kids to do something that they aren&#39;t necessarily <br/>\nfeeling confident about doing on their own, you are putting them in a <br/>\nfearful situation. And you aren&#39;t alleviating that fear. If you demonstrated <br/>\nthat going and asking for help wasn&#39;t a big deal and was just some other <br/>\nthing, you wouldn&#39;t need to prod your children to do it. It would just be <br/>\nsome other thing. But, instead, you&#39;ve made it not only a big deal, but a <br/>\nritualized one, where you stand behind the curious child at some distance to <br/>\noffer moral support. How would you feel (to use a Joyce-esque approach) if <br/>\nevery time you asked your husband a question in a store he sent you to the <br/>\ncounter to find out, standing 2-3 feet behind you to help you feel more <br/>\ncomfortable? If he said &quot;well, I can&#39;t do everything for you in life?&quot; <br/>\nDavid, my husband, doesn&#39;t like to call and order things on the phone. So, I <br/>\ntend to do that. I don&#39;t like to call and arrange for plumbers or roofers or <br/>\ncar mechanics on the phone, so he does that. Not being willing to do <br/>\nsomething as a child hasn&#39;t meant that I can&#39;t function in society. I mean, <br/>\nexcept for the not putting my kids into school and not schooling them at <br/>\nhome and living a life that is rich and free, I seem to function really well <br/>\nin society.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; To each his own.
