My child<br/>\nwould spend hours and hours playing MarioKart on his Nintendo DS.  I<br/>\nthought it was a waste of time but for reasons unrelated to anything, I<br/>\nlet him spend his time that way.  Turns out he wasn&#39;t just playing, he<br/>\nwas exploring and learning.  He learned how to modify the program so he<br/>\ncould manipulate his game his way.  Things like unlimited jumping or<br/>\n300x speed or Rainbow Mario were, I thought, foolish wastes of time<br/>\nhowever clever it was to figure that out.  He then moved on (like all<br/>\npeople do, I think).  For him it was moving on to programing his kindle.<br/>\nHis blog was mentioned a couple times in ebooks and bigger blogs which<br/>\ntotally made his day.  I suspect one day he&#39;ll be a programing wiz.  All<br/>\nthis started with a love of physiology.  What&#39;s the connection?  In my<br/>\nopinion, he really gravitates towards understanding the mechanics of how<br/>\nthings work.  Not spending time on text books gave him the time to learn<br/>\nthe details of those things I thought were silly past times.  He was<br/>\nabout 14 at the time.<br/>\nI&#39;m learning - for me myself and I - that &quot;unschooling&quot; is uncomfortable<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m looking for the practical solution to problems such as How<br/>\nWill This Lead To A Career (or, Will He Ever Move Out Of My Home).  When<br/>\nI stop wondering about what will happen in five years, I can reflect on<br/>\nthe last five years and I can see they were anything but stagnant.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this will help at all. My daughter doesn&#39;t seem to have<br/>\nany interests except for reading books and hanging out with friends (of<br/>\nwhich we have precious few).  So in a way, I&#39;m whistling in the dark<br/>\nhere myself and perhaps this is just to make me feel better, but I think<br/>\nthere&#39;s something to this idea that in allowing a child to focus on<br/>\ntheir interests, they will naturally learn what they love to do (just<br/>\nlike toddlers do without a curriculum).  At the same time, I try to<br/>\nteach my kids the kinds of skills they&#39;ll need to live independently one<br/>\nday - keeping the house orderly, paying bills, organizing our time, etc.<br/>\nWhether or not your son ever has his &quot;dream job&quot; is separate from having<br/>\nthe skills he&#39;ll need to live independently.

I just want to say that I am completely facinated by the &quot;unschooling concept&quot; and am enjoying reading these posts, especially this one because it raises many questions that I have as I am very new to this concept. I just ordered the Life Learning book and I am eager to read it. I can see that this group is a wonderful support and offers so much valuable information. I am eager to learn more. My son taught himself how to use scratch and has thoroughly enjoyed it (he is 12). I hope to learn more and in doing so unprogram myself from the ways of thinking that a formal education is required and college is a must.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent 13 years in little prominant private schools and then went right off to earn a 4 year degree in business, yet it really is not what I was meant to do. Now I see what a love of learning I have, enjoying books of subjects that interest me. I love to read and learn more, forming my own opinions. I see my husband who spent 13 years in the public school, 2 years in college before leaving and starting a successful DJ business. Now he is shooting his screenplay into a full feature independednt film (no film degree or formal education in that field) and we will see what that brings. But my point is he had a desire to study and learn independently and he did it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am happy to have removed my oldest from the public school and I hope to remove my other 2 children and to have the confidence to unschool and know that they will find their passion naturally. <br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea     <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:plaidpanties666@...\">plaidpanties666@...</a>&gt; <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Sunday, March 20, 2011 8:26:01 PM <br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: 16-yr-old -- is unschooling the best choice?

It&#39;s learning specific pieces of <br/>\ninformation that give him difficulty or learning using more generally applied <br/>\ntechniques of instruction.  I would assume that he, like everybody else, learns <br/>\nfrom the world around him via the things that engage him. The idea that someone <br/>\nwould have difficulty learning puzzles me. Really. I&#39;m not being sarcastic. I <br/>\nunderstand how dyslexia can make reading a bigger hurdle or how dyscalculia can <br/>\nmake numbers harder to deal with, but I&#39;m not at all sure that I see how those <br/>\ndifficulties are truly obstacles to learning. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________<br/>\nI&#39;m  most concerned about my oldest child (age 16) who has special needs.

How long have you been supporting his <br/>\ninterests and helping him to engage with the world in the way the he wants? You <br/>\nstart this e-mail with &quot;I feel as though I&#39;ve been `dabbling&#39; in unschooling, <br/>\nbut am wondering  if I&#39;m doing it right. I love the philosophy and really think <br/>\nthis is  best for my kids.&quot; If you keep starting and stopping, if you keep <br/>\nlooking for measures of success, if you are confused about how much learning is <br/>\ninvolved in game playing and tv watching, you may not have gotten to a point <br/>\nwhere you&#39;ve stopped deschooling and started unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________<br/>\nI&#39;ve never given tests and really encouraged my kids to follow their interests.<br/>\n________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nis contradicted by: <br/>\n<br/>\n________________________<br/>\nWe&#39;re required to test yearly and my children have never done well on them. <br/>\n________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nI recognise that the testing is something that you are legally bound to do, but <br/>\nyou don&#39;t have to read the test scores, do you? You don&#39;t need to recognise the <br/>\ntests as valuable pieces of information or reasonable measures of your children. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________<br/>\nWhatever their interests were, I made sure I had anything on hand that they <br/>\nmight . . . books, activities, etc. and would take them wherever they wanted to <br/>\ngo. For example, my youngest loves dinosaurs so he loves going to the museum. I <br/>\nwould make dinosaur excavations in our yard, get dinosaur models, etc.<br/>\n________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nComputer games? Video games? Cool television programmes? Walkthroughs? New games <br/>\nthat your 16 year old may not have heard of that are similar to one&#39;s you know <br/>\nhe liked? Videos of parodies of things he may enjoy? Do you help create those <br/>\nconnections as well as the ones that look more academic? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s cool to be doing the dinosaur stuff. Could you also see your son&#39;s interest <br/>\nin media like video games and computer games and television as serious learning?<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son wants to be a videogame programmer. We sent away for info on what <br/>\ncolleges required. He saw that math was one of subjects, but it didn&#39;t motivate <br/>\nhim.

He could create new areas on Roblox. Explore it. Look for ways for <br/>\nhim to create a video game right now, not after jumping over some hurdle. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe, too, he doesn&#39;t really want to be a video game programmer, maybe he just <br/>\nwanted to have something to answer you and his dad when you asked him what he <br/>\nwanted to do.

There are a huge amount of hurdles <br/>\nto overcome. They take attention and reflection and thought and learning and <br/>\nthinking and interest and engagement. Play one, or watch him play one. I used to <br/>\nplay a lot of video games with Simon and Linnaea. The other day I tried to play <br/>\nSuper Mario Galaxy 2 and I had to spend a bit running through levels just to get <br/>\nback up to almost speed on how to play. Simon was very tolerant of my inability <br/>\nas he partnered with me. <br/>\n<br/>\n___________________<br/>\n<br/>\nHis new career goal is to test video games, but only the ones that he likes to <br/>\nplay. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;ll have to try a lot to figure out which one&#39;s he likes... Simon and Linnaea <br/>\nhave beta tested a few different games, but in mass beta testings, not as paid <br/>\ntesters. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DH has been supportive, but we&#39;re both concerned about his future.<br/>\n____________________<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a bumper sticker, somewhere, that says &quot;Unschooling for a better today&quot;. <br/>\nIt reminds me of the cliché &quot;to mind the pence and the pounds will take care of <br/>\nthemselves.&quot; Take care of right now, look for ways to make it good and engaging <br/>\nand fun and interesting. The more right now is good, the more pleasure his today <br/>\noffers, the more he will learn from it how to make the next day good and <br/>\nengaging and interesting and fun. It also reminds me of the mayor of Asterix and <br/>\nObelix&#39;s village in the Asterix and Obelix comic book series.

","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1188256062\">I feel as though I&#39;ve been `dabbling&#39; in unschooling, but am wondering if I&#39;m doing it right. I love the philosophy and really think this is best for my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m most concerned about my oldest child (age 16) who has special needs. He only wants to watch tv and play video and computer games. He has learning disabilities, so I know that learning is difficult for him. With two years left of &quot;official&quot; high school, I&#39;m worried about his future.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never given tests and really encouraged my kids to follow their interests. Whatever their interests were, I made sure I had anything on hand that they might . . . books, activities, etc. and would take them wherever they wanted to go. For example, my youngest loves dinosaurs so he loves going to the museum. I would make dinosaur excavations in our yard, get dinosaur models, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re required to test yearly and my children have never done well on them. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son wants to be a videogame programmer. We sent away for info on what colleges required. He saw that math was one of subjects, but it didn&#39;t motivate him. He wanted to take a community class in programming, but after a few days, he dropped out because it was too hard. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe just doesn&#39;t seem to have the discipline to stick with anything other than playing video games (which he is good at).<br/>\n<br/>\nHis new career goal is to test video games, but only the ones that he likes to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy DH has been supportive, but we&#39;re both concerned about his future. I&#39;m totally fine with keeping him home a few extra years, but I&#39;m starting to wonder if my son will ever have that love of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nDH is putting pressure on me to start forcing some &quot;book learning&quot; so that he&#39;ll be prepared for some sort of a career. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking for any advice and suggestions you have.
