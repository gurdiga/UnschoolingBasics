Sierra had <br/>\ncome out to help, and he grabbed an old kiddie pool and suggested <br/>\ntrying to make baskets with the pine cones (to make the clean up <br/>\nmore fun).<br/>\nThis proceeded nicely and pretty soon Jalen and Jared had ventured <br/>\nout and decided it looked fun. After getting a small section of the <br/>\nyard looking nice, Jared was totally inspired. He stayed and help <br/>\nrake for over an hour and started talking about cleaning up another <br/>\narea, planting things and creating a little oasis.<br/>\nWe all sat down for a break. He was sweaty and dirty, but smiling.<br/>\nHe said &quot;This is fun, I like working in the yard. When you and Dad <br/>\nmade us do it, I hated it, but when you can choose to do it, it&#39;s <br/>\nfun.&quot;<br/>\nWords of wisdom from my (then) 10y.o.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4102,"nextTopicId":4105}}
