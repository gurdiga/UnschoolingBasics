That&#39;s not mandatory.  The primary focus here is educating <br/>\nfamilies on the signs and symptoms of post-partum depression.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, under the screening section, it specifically states that <br/>\nscreenings are to be OFFERED.  There is no mandate here.  If, the <br/>\nscreening indicates a risk of post-partum depression, the mother is <br/>\nto recieve a referral to a mental health care center.  She is still <br/>\nin control of which she chooses and what services to accept.  She is <br/>\nable to decide for herself if medication is acceptable and if not she <br/>\ncan choose a provider that uses therapy.  The other services to be <br/>\nprovided include: transportation services, attendant care, homemaker <br/>\nservices, day or respite care, and providing counseling on financial <br/>\nassistance and insurance.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOWHERE in this act does it even mention drugs or pharmaceuticals, <br/>\nlet alone mandate.  Please, try to keep your facts straight and give <br/>\nvalid reasons for asking our assistance.  Critical thinking is what <br/>\nwe teach our kids in homeschooling.  Please, understand that those <br/>\nlessons come from parents who are capable of critical thinking <br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Are you affiliated with CCHR?
