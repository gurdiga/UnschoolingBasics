Although inherent to some  <br/>\nessays, the book does not really delve into non coercive parenting  <br/>\nissues relating to radical unschooling in much detail.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not mention this as a criticism, just a description. I actually  <br/>\nfound the emphasis quite useful given the context of other  <br/>\nunschooling books out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway if this interests you, find out more:<br/>\n<br/>\nby reading the full review at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theparentingpit.com/reviews/hunt_unschool_unmanual/\">http://theparentingpit.com/reviews/hunt_unschool_unmanual/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand/ or ordering the book from jan&#39;s site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.org/unmanual/\">http://www.naturalchild.org/unmanual/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand no, i dont get a commission...<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers,<br/>\narun<br/>\n_____________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theparentingpit.com\">http://www.theparentingpit.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28906,"nextTopicId":28963}}
