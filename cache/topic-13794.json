He was the person i fell in love with 25 years ago (way before kids).   Exactly why we came to the first conference two years ago - hoping that what he has in his heart would resurface.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing around so many thoughtful folks is soooo important.  As an unschooling family, going to conferences are as important as putting gas in our car.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Pamela Sorooshian <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, May 30, 2006 2:32 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] conferences<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Robin and Ron, who left all their fears in the hotel wastebasket.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Next conference theme?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Live and Learn Unschooling Conference: Leave All Your Fears in the  <br/>\n  Hotel Wastebasket!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Awesome!<br/>\n<br/>\n  -pam<br/>\n  Unschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\n  Live Love Learn<br/>\n  UNSCHOOL!<br/>\n  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS Secondary school education  Graduate school education  Home school education  <br/>\n        Graduate school education online  High school education  Chicago school education  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!
