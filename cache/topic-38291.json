It is most likely genetic, although that does not mean that environmental factors won&#39;t come into play. It seems a minor thing to be concerned about. Eyes change fairly frequently. Pregnancy can change your eyesight. One thing you could do to lessen the effect might be to set up comfortable seats and pillows and cushions a bit further back from the tv, or get a bigger screen. In 1974 screen sizes would have been smaller and the reception would have been grainer than in modern television. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180097986,"authorName":"Ellen","from":"&quot;Ellen&quot; &lt;ellen@...&gt;","profile":"livnsimply","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: TV,  unschooling and vision","postDate":"1234495456","msgId":38295,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGduMnA1MCtsYWY5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGduMXMzditnYWtkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38291,"nextInTopic":38299,"prevInTime":38294,"nextInTime":38296,"topicId":38291,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There is so much written on the topic of media to scare parents.

That being","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1799566785\">Just to preface this question, we began unschooling (radically) in <br/>\nOctober 2008 and have found it to be amazing and we love living this <br/>\nlifestyle.  That being said, I decided to read a book that I&#39;ve <br/>\nalways heard about: Better Late than Early by Raymond and Dorothy <br/>\nMoore.  I&#39;m sure most, if not all, of you know this book :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, as I&#39;m reading this book, I&#39;m enjoying it because it all <br/>\nmakes sense.  And then, while reading about visual development in <br/>\nchildren and doing &quot;close work&quot; and how this can have an negative <br/>\nimpact on their ability to suceed in later years (meaning that all <br/>\nthe reading, close up busy work, focusing on blackboards, etc is not <br/>\nhealthy for the developing eyes in the early years (schooling) until <br/>\nthe child has developed maturity in developmental, emotional, <br/>\nphysical ways) they mention that tv watching in the early years is <br/>\nalso considered &quot;close work&quot; and has been shown to influence sight <br/>\nrelated disorders in later years i.e. nearsightedness. This book was <br/>\nwritten in 1974 and of course, since then, computers are now in the <br/>\nmix. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, since unschooling, we&#39;ve not been restricting TV watching and <br/>\nhave watched our 2 kids go from watching a lot of tv (as expected) to <br/>\nwatching more sporadically and also engaging in others things while <br/>\nthe tv is on in the background. They also go on the internet at times <br/>\ntoo.  My issue and question is not related to how much <br/>\ntv/computers...we are fine with that issue.  They claim that this <br/>\nissue becomes less of a concern as the children develop maturity <br/>\nusually after 8-10 years old. My kids are 2.5 yo and 7 yo. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just wondering if others have read anything about this as well?  <br/>\nDo you have any concerns about this?  If anyone has read this book, <br/>\ndid you get hung up on this idea? I&#39;m not about to restrict my kids <br/>\ntv watching and computer use.  However, reading this just really made <br/>\nmy heart sink.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome ideas I have is that although they do watch tv and go on the <br/>\ncomputer, they are making this choice...they are not being forced <br/>\ninto doing this &quot;close work&quot; like the kids at school are and that my <br/>\nkids always have the option of focusing their eyes far away and <br/>\nresting them if necessary.  Perhaps, naturally they become involved <br/>\nin other activities to give their eyes a rest.  Also, they do a lot <br/>\nof other things while the tv is on so they are often moving their <br/>\neyes around.  My son does get headaches on occassion that now I&#39;m <br/>\nwondering if it might be related to this idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, at the same time, they also look at magazines, books, play <br/>\nwith toys, figures, legos, etc.  Wouldn&#39;t all this be <br/>\nconsidered &quot;close work&quot; as well?  Especially in the winter, when we <br/>\nstay indoors more, there is more &quot;close work&quot;.  The authors say that <br/>\noptimally, looking more at distance things is best for kids up to 8-<br/>\n10 years old.  However, really, how can a little one be more distance <br/>\noriented visually at this age most of the time?  Especially during <br/>\nthe winter months? Am I giving this paragraph more attention than it <br/>\nneeds?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anything, I think this will make me more mindful about offering <br/>\nother activities throughout the day but I still need to hear what <br/>\nothers think about this because now, of course, I&#39;m thinking that all <br/>\nthis tv and computer watching is...gasp...bad ;) Just kidding...</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38301,"nextTopicId":38172}}
