Steiner the creater of this curiculum <br/>\nsaid kids really should not begin school at all until at least 12 <br/>\nyears of age, but that the waldorf method was a compromise with the <br/>\ngerman govt requirements. as a former class teacher I found waldorf <br/>\nhas deteriorated into a mere art tinged venture.<br/>\n some one wrote about college for unschoolers and asked for replies; <br/>\nwe have been unschooling for 2 years now , my son is 13 and the whole <br/>\nconcept of college as a given has crashed for me as of late. I have <br/>\n13 years of college level education and my wife 12. these have given <br/>\nsome oppurtunities and plenty of debt. My experience is that income <br/>\nproducing structures shift throughout ones lifetime. Many things are <br/>\ncaged out requiring degrees and other formalized hoops, but many are <br/>\nnot. <br/>\nI am hoping my son will find some way to make a living at some time <br/>\nin his 20&#39;s , but I am more interested that he engage his experience <br/>\nof life with a level of intent constructed by him and less as a <br/>\nreaction to what the &quot;others&quot; dictate as a necessity. I feel I have <br/>\nwasted too much of my decision making on finding a way to live within <br/>\na defensable posture of what a man is supposed to do in life. College <br/>\nseems to be a &#39;working world lite&#39; indoctrination, offering a taste <br/>\nof the good life, and hooking one on the anxieties of our culture, <br/>\nlearning to figure out where you fit in and honing an ability to be <br/>\nperjoritive to others as a defense to feeling vulnerable and needy. <br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t seem to have much difference to the lower levels of <br/>\neductional rigidity. <br/>\nI think if you have to go through an experience that is unpleasant <br/>\ndue to an artifice designed with little  validity, just to get to the <br/>\nother side, then your likely to be infected with a veiw of reality <br/>\nthat will continue to propogate. its hard to turn paradigms around, <br/>\nwhat you think is important now will determine how you understand <br/>\nlife. Our constructions of life , of our past influence our <br/>\nconstructions of the present and future. I think every step is <br/>\nimportant and college seems pretty loaded with a labyrinth of <br/>\ncompromise solutions that it is going to be incredibly difficult to <br/>\nanalyse, deconstruct and create a reality that isn&#39;t stifling. <br/>\njust an opinion at the moment<br/>\npatrick</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] after school","postDate":"1137849159","msgId":9439,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDN0VDQTM3RDgyNTY5QS0xMzY4LTE3MkBGV00tTTE1LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTIxMDQ0OTExLjM5NTg0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMwMTA4Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":9428,"nextInTopic":22189,"prevInTime":9438,"nextInTime":9440,"topicId":9428,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He used up every bit of his energy being a model <br/>\nstudent during the day, so that by the time he got home there was nothing left? Yet he still knew you <br/>\nwould love and accept him, so he could blow off steam and take things out on you and his siblings without<br/>\nbeing sent to the principal&#39;s office?<br/>\n <br/>\nPoor kids in school. I think that&#39;s a common problem. They try to be on their best behaviot there because<br/>\nparents ask them to and because it&#39;s what&#39;s expected. But they are given no time to wind down and get rid <br/>\nof all the pent up anger and frustrations they have. The younger sibling, the dog, and Mom become the <br/>\nresipients because they&#39;re safe and they&#39;ll love him anyway.<br/>\n <br/>\n   ~KellyKelly LovejoyConference CoordinatorLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158523003,"authorName":"Sandra Zires","from":"Sandra Zires &lt;sandralzires@...&gt;","profile":"sandralzires","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Digest Number 720","postDate":"1137818951","msgId":9428,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTIxMDQ0OTExLjM5NTg0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMwMTA4Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMzc4MDI4NzAuMTM5My44MTI0NS5tMzJAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9439,"prevInTime":9427,"nextInTime":9429,"topicId":9428,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Good evening all, I am new to this group, Nashville, homeschooling and unschooling.

I have three children, 7, 5, & 2.  I pulled my 7 yr old from ps after the winter break.  He had been in various public and private PT schools since he was 2 1/2 and hated EVERY moment. His behavior at home was TERRIBLE, at school, however, he was an angel.  When I inquired about his behavior his teachers always raved that he was a model student.  I knew that he hated it though.  Deep down I feared that he was better off in school due to the fact that I had such trouble with his impulsiveness and aggression toward his smaller siblings. <br/>\n  To make a LONG story short I started some serious work on my own spiritual growth.  I devoured all the books that I could that pertained to Peace, parenting and the journey of the soul.  I learned quite a bit.  I am now strong and feel ready to unschool my children.  I handle our conflicts & challenges with a sense of patience I never knew.  My son is LOVING life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So am I.  Thank you all for participating on this site. I have finally found a place I can talk about my beliefs without fear of ridicule.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Good night.<br/>\n  Peace & Blessings, <br/>\n  Sandra <br/>\n   <br/>\n  PS... I found The Family Virtues Guide: Simple Ways to Bring Out the Best in Our Children and Ourselves.  (Linda Popov) a wonderful tool. I highly recommend it.  It helps parents and children learn and use the language of the virtues.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21868,"nextTopicId":22191}}
