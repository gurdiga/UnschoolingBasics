Hell, you <br/>\nalready have three hour trips to see the girlfriend! &lt;G&gt; USE them! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Stay calm and QUIET and let him talk---you don&#39;t need to say much at <br/>\nall. Just nod and bite your tongue unless he asks a direct question. <br/>\nMaybe an occasional &quot;Why?&quot; or How?&quot; to keep it moving.

I think that adopting is a very important emotional time for everyone as it would be with the birth of a new child. I think it is very important to be aware that stressing that HOW a child came to be in the family can make a difference in how the child views themself and how others may view them. <br/>\nMy parents are my parents. I happened to be born out of another woman&#39;s uterus. I have different genes, different medical history. Those are facts and can&#39;t (and shouldn&#39;t) be denied.<br/>\nIn discussing unschooling, we talk about the power of words and changing the way we speak of things in order to change our outlook. I think that blending the family to one whole requires the awareness of how certain words affect our outlooks.<br/>\n&quot;These are my 4 children, Mary, Mark, Luke and John.&quot; is different than<br/>\n&quot;These are my children Mary, Mark, and John and this is my adopted son Luke.&quot;<br/>\nLuke is different, other.<br/>\nIf one uses a surrogate and donated eggs for example, one doesn&#39;t say, &quot;This is my son Luke who was born via a surrogate with no genetic material from me.&quot; He&#39;s a son.<br/>\nMy parents (who did an awful lot wrong) did me a huge favor. They NEVER differentiated between my brothers and me by pointing out my adoption.  I&#39;m very grateful that I had a safe place to always feel a part of and not different, since there were so many other people in my life who would question me about being adopted, asking stupid questions like &quot;Do you know who your &quot;real&quot; family is? (I lived with my &quot;real&quot; family)<br/>\nOur society itself is very quick to point out adoptees, it still has a sort of stigma attached.<br/>\nMany articles about TomKat are sure to point out that he also has two adopted children with Nicole Kidman. It&#39;s usually somewhere at the end of the article, almost as an after thought.<br/>\n Another example is &quot;They couldn&#39;t have children of their own, therefore they decided to adopt&quot; Second choice. Not as good.<br/>\nI think there is a world of difference between  &quot;Luke, who came to us when he was seven&quot; and &quot;Luke, my Adopted son&quot; Capital A, labeled and different.<br/>\n<br/>\nElissa Jill<br/>\nA Kindersher saychel iz oychet a saychel.<br/>\n&quot;A Child&#39;s wisdom is also wisdom.&quot; ~Yiddish Proverb<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Really struggling with a teenager :(","postDate":"1160748827","msgId":18153,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZGRERDQkYxLTFFNzQtNEVFQy1BMUU3LUQ0OUJEMzIzQjg4QkBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVnbnVwNCtrbm10QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVnbnVwNCtrbm10QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18150,"nextInTopic":18154,"prevInTime":18152,"nextInTime":18154,"topicId":18144,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t have much experience parenting a teenager, but I remember being 13 and totally in love with a guy.

What I remember is my mom  <br/>\ntelling me for the longest time, that &#39;love was a beautiful thing&#39;  <br/>\nand &#39;we all make our own choices&#39;, but when it came down to it, what  <br/>\nshe meant was that you can make your own choices as long as she  <br/>\nthought it was okay. When you are talking with him, try to keep in  <br/>\nmind that he is feeling attacked. So how else can you solve the  <br/>\nproblem? Esp since there are  younger kids in consideration, etc,  <br/>\nthere needs to be some work in finding a middle ground. Sitting down  <br/>\nover coffee and talking isn&#39;t usually a guy brain way of solving  <br/>\nproblems....some guys are like that, but some aren&#39;t. Talking at them  <br/>\nmakes them feel attacked. Maybe he&#39;d work better problem solving  <br/>\nwhile you guys are playing video games, or fishing, or hiking, or  <br/>\nshopping. Just saying &quot;You know, I&#39;m so glad you feel so much love  <br/>\nfor X. I can tell you&#39;re happy to be with her and that makes me  <br/>\nhappy. I am having trouble helping you though, what can we do to get  <br/>\nXYZ?&quot; Build up to it though, don&#39;t expect to solve all the problems  <br/>\nin one hike, he&#39;s got to know that it&#39;s a safe topic to talk about  <br/>\nwithout you getting emotional, and it&#39;s good practice for you as  <br/>\nwell. Maybe once ask what makes him so happy to be with her. Use  <br/>\nnoncommittal responses...&quot;Wow, I didn&#39;t know that&quot;, or &quot;I remember  <br/>\nwhen I was 13 I felt that way about a guy&quot;. If he says you don&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand, be willing to say &quot;You&#39;re right, I can&#39;t know exactly how  <br/>\nyou&#39;re feeling, but what I see is that you are happy to spend time  <br/>\nwith her&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs mentioned he&#39;s still deschooling, and I&#39;ll bet you are too.

I think the &#39;month per year of school&#39; may  <br/>\nbe optimistic, because when you are working on your own issues as  <br/>\nwell, you can&#39;t put your full energy into deschooling him, kwim?

He is <br/>\nheavily into a relationship with a 15 yr old girl he met at school <br/>\nbut who now lives three hours away by car.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have tried to be as supportive as possible - he speaks to her all <br/>\nthe time via msn or the phone.  We bought him an internet phone so <br/>\nthat he can get free calls, arranged a weekend away so that he could <br/>\nvisit her on the way (he stayed overnight at her parents, came back <br/>\nwith a neck covered in lovebites (hickies?) and sobbed the whole way <br/>\nback and into the next day bcos he didn&#39;t want to leave her).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis relationship in itself is throwing up all sorts of issues for me <br/>\nand I&#39;m trying to talk things through with him calmly - issues about <br/>\nemotional needs, physical needs, taking other people into <br/>\nconsideration, etc- but I am emotional and so is he so we each feel <br/>\nattacked and not heard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI expected some deschooling but all this on top is just stressing me <br/>\nto the max.  He&#39;s gone away with my mother for the weekend so I&#39;m <br/>\nhoping to get some perspective and advice in the meantime.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading if you&#39;ve got this far-sorry its a bit long (and <br/>\nprobably garbled !).<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice ?<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18120,"nextTopicId":18247}}
