When we see it IS all a<br/>\nchoice, that shifts the entire feeling of everything. Christmas is one<br/>\nof our favorite times, but I don&#39;t feel the whole &quot;obligation&quot; thing<br/>\nanymore. That was self-induced.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a common preference with our extended family that the focus is<br/>\non the kids. I really, truly don&#39;t want a bunch of gifts (though I&#39;m<br/>\nhappy if I receive them too) because it makes me so happy to focus on<br/>\nthe children. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe adults don&#39;t worry about buying for each other. We mostly just<br/>\nsend cards and photos. The people we make things for are people we<br/>\ntruly adore. We would send them these things with or without a holiday<br/>\nas an excuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I&#39;ve released is doing all our favorite traditions by<br/>\na certain date. I LOVE making the traditional gingerbread houses, but<br/>\nif things are busy we just make them after Christmas. Heck, we&#39;ll make<br/>\nthem in July if we feel like it. We can do it whenever it feels like<br/>\nfun!  We&#39;ve done a Christmas meal that was Mexican themed before,<br/>\nsimple and delicious. :)  We decide exactly what works for all of us<br/>\nand let the rest go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one of the healing aspects of unschooling for me...there are no<br/>\n&quot;rules&quot; or &quot;right&quot; way to do anything. Holiday is what we choose and<br/>\nwe choose to make it fun and soul-nourishing. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151505017,"authorName":"carenkh","from":"&quot;carenkh&quot; &lt;carenkh@...&gt;","profile":"carenkh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Christmas","postDate":"1189780252","msgId":26182,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZjZTV1cyttcjEwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNlMS4xYWM0Y2Q1MS4zNDFiZWU3YkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26180,"nextInTopic":26194,"prevInTime":26181,"nextInTime":26183,"topicId":26180,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pam, thank you for this post.

Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me  it&#39;s the trying to figure out what to get the long list of people.  <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nFor Christmas (and all year long really) the best gift that our  family gives <br/>\nitself is the gift of doing, being, giving, visiting exactly who,  what, <br/>\nwhen, where we WANT.  I don&#39;t have a list of people to &quot;give&quot;  to.  I have a list <br/>\nof wonderful, caring, important people in my life.   No NOT all family members <br/>\nmake it onto that list, I will probably still send  them a little note <br/>\nletting them know I am thinking of them.  But my time is  valuable and giving of my <br/>\ntime is a special thing.  Making or buying gifts  for people I really care <br/>\nabout is a JOY, I love thinking about the person, what  they would truly enjoy, <br/>\nwhat would bring a smile to their face etc.  I do  not feel the obligation of <br/>\nChristmas that so many people feel.  It doesn&#39;t  bother me if someone questions <br/>\nwhy I didn&#39;t give them a gift.  Probably  deep in their heart they already <br/>\nknow why.  I don&#39;t try to be &quot;fair&quot; by the  standard terminology.  To me fair <br/>\nmeans giving people exactly what they  want/need.  And that INCLUDES myself.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy boys, Jackson and myself get what we want all year  long.  No we are not <br/>\nmade of money, and we do a lot of saving and  budgeting, but wanting something <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t just happen at Christmas.  We also  get and give each other gifts at <br/>\nChristmas, with that extra something...the  extra thought that goes into <br/>\npicking out a gift.  I haven&#39;t really thought  about it but for us maybe the <br/>\ndifference is that at Christmas it is about  getting the gift the person never knew <br/>\nthey would enjoy so much, along with some  from the &quot;Christmas list&quot;.  Finding <br/>\nthat perfect something for someone so  very special.  I LOVE THE SEARCH.  I <br/>\nlove the thought. <br/>\n <br/>\nSince letting go of the typical Christmas, we have  enjoyed Christmas so much <br/>\nmore, we also have a solstice celebration as  well.  It did take a lot to rid <br/>\nmyself of the feelings of guilt, the  &quot;should have&quot; done &quot;should have given&quot; <br/>\nwhoever etc.  But it has made a  tremendous change in the holiday season, for <br/>\nthe better, for us.<br/>\n <br/>\nPam  G<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit my blog:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26077,"nextTopicId":26144}}
