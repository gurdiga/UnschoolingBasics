One of the things that has brought me so much joy this week is watching my children enjoy their gifts.  I got them the things they asked for but I also added several items just to see if they would like them.  My son, Jared usually doesn&#39;t like craft type stuff, but he got a wood burning kit and has been having a great time with it.  He and my daughter have also been having a good time with their new air hockey table and have been &#39;inventing&#39; new ways to play outside of the typical rules.  I love that they do this!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We had fairly nice temps for this time of the year so we met our local unschooling group for an impromtu play at the park.  Most of us shared that we are sick of holidays (or maybe sick of relatives would be more precise:0).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I find myself wishing I had the money to go out and get them several new toys like this each month so they would have a constant flow of new stuff to explore and enjoy.

Yesterday<br/>\nwas spent watching new movies and playing new games. Karl discovered Kate&#39;s<br/>\ncollection of Manga (Get Backers series) and has been reading through the<br/>\nseries. I looked high and low for a copy of a computer game we used to have<br/>\ncalled Droidworks that Ben vaguely remembered and really wanted for<br/>\nChristmas, so he&#39;s been playing that a lot yesterday and today. Today,  I<br/>\ntook everything out of my kitchen cupboards and totally reorganized them.<br/>\nThey&#39;ve been driving me crazy for weeks and this week I have time to tackle<br/>\nthese kinds of projects.  At the moment, the older three have a bunch of<br/>\nfriends over (at last count there are about 14 teens here). Some are playing<br/>\nImaginiff and the rest are upstairs watching a movie.  Lisa fixed lots of<br/>\ngood food for everyone and everyone is having a good time. Well, everyone<br/>\nexcept Larry, our iguana. He climbed on the kitchen table and tried to eat<br/>\noff the veggie tray. Now, he eats lots of veggies and I&#39;m not particularly<br/>\nfussy about animals eating off the tray, but he needs them chopped smaller<br/>\nthan the ones on the tray.

He can be<br/>\nquite determined! He was not very happy with me. So all in all, a very nice<br/>\nweek so far. We are so involved in 4-H and Odyssey of the mind and other<br/>\nactivities that I really enjoy the break.

In most cases, Graham and I sit down and discuss our mutual interest and see if we want to collaborate together. I offer opportunities and he decides. Sometimes his interest lags halfway into the project or when it gets to a point where his skills and abilities are stretched. At this point there can be more gentle nudging onward on my part as I have worked with oodles of kids and I have learned that many have needed that extra external structure and support to get through difficult spots. Its later then upon the projects completion that the children have great pride in accomplishing those difficult tasks, they see it as their victory not mine.  I am all for  a child to be self internalised in all that they do, however we may disagree on the methods for getting there. For example I have spent endless hours working with kids and adults in challenge adventure education. When a person decides they want to say rapel off a cliff and we have taught them everything they need to know and they really want to do it and now they are at the edge of cliff and fear has frozen them up(as it is not a natural feeling to lean backward into space over a cliff) we don&#39;t force them over the edge but we incorporate our knowledge of this child and then utilize what support we can. We try to work them through their fear to a place of trust and safety, sometimes they go over terrified and sometimes crying. It can be the scariest most difficult thing they have ever done and when they are done they are on cloud nine...watch out world here I come. I don&#39;t know if that is a good illustration or not however knowing a child and their thinking process and beliefs allows a caring adult to taylor their  learning opportunities and sometimes I have found an external structure to be exactly what is needed. I really respect many things about unschooling which is why I am here though honestly I am more of a hybrid unschooler/experiential/challenge educator.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; We expect him to eat healthy and excercise each day. We<br/>\ndon&#39;t impose any learning situations&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you don&#39;t mind me pointing out the contradiction here....if <br/>\nyou make him eat a certain way and exercise, that is an imposition <br/>\non his learning in my book! You can still be an unschooler, and hang <br/>\nonto those kind of parenting styles...<br/>\n***I am certainly comfortable with how we are proceeding with our approach to health and fitness. We don&#39;t force him to eat anything though we do expect him to eat for example two vegatables with each meal. He can decide what those veggies are. We expect him to exercise each day. Currently we are offering a whole body workout which represents some of the most current research on fitness and health. We do it together as a family, he takes pride in his gaining strength and flexibility. He is not always gun hoe in starting it each day, however by the end of the session he is alert, more fit, and happy and proud to have accomplished it. I have seen plenty of unfit homeschoolers and frankly I believe we have a responsibility to raise our children to be fit and healthy as well as self directed and confident in their abilities. My son gets about one cold per year and it doesn&#39;t hang around long. He doesn&#39;t get cavities. He has come to enjoy eating healthy, the only time we get flack is when one of his friends are over for dinner and this friend doesn&#39;t value eating healthy, then that unhealthy peer dynamic can play out, but its mostly noise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s up to all individuals to take what they want from any list of <br/>\ncourse, but the advice is geared towards applying unschooling <br/>\nphilosophies to all areas. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know Ren in my marriage we longer give advice as we have found that neither of us want it. We have come to see that its more interesting and respectful to inspire each other. Believe me this has been a journey to get here and we slip(mostly me) once in awhile. We might share ideas that we are excited about for example when I shared about the plants in my previous posts. However if I determine this to be an advice list I won&#39;t be around long.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings,<br/>\nChuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Another introduction","postDate":"1135576414","msgId":8534,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRvbzBndSs1MjFlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8540,"prevInTime":8533,"nextInTime":8535,"topicId":8534,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Welcome Chuck.
