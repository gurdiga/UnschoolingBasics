There are so  many similarities to my  family.  My <br/>\nson left school at the end of the sixth grade, actually we  didn&#39;t wait for <br/>\nthe year to end.  I remember telling his teacher that I was  going to homeschool <br/>\nhim and thinking that was a threat..lol.  I never  thought I would actually <br/>\ndo it.  I can just imagine what she would think  about unschooling.  She was a <br/>\nvery controlling woman..&quot;he has to conform,  we all have to so he might as <br/>\nwell get used to it now&quot;...  that kind of  thing.

I&#39;m especially glad that he won&#39;t have to  DEschool.<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;That deschooling thing is hard----it&#39;s really, really hard. He  needs to  <br/>\nknow <br/>\nyou&#39;re there. He needs to know you care. But he needs to  be left to heal. I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t mean just left alone. There&#39;s this incredibly  fine line between <br/>\nleaving  <br/>\nhim alone and letting him alone. I don&#39;t  know how to explain it. But you&#39;ll <br/>\nknow  it AFTER you&#39;re through it!  &lt;G&gt; Go figure!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you so much for admitting how hard it was.  I know it&#39;s OK for  him to <br/>\nspend his time pursuing his interests but when I see how fast the  time seems <br/>\nto fly by I start getting anxious.  I know it&#39;s OK for him to  play video <br/>\ngames, or whatever as much as he wants, but I have to keep  reminding myself that <br/>\nI know it&#39;s OK, if you know what I mean. &lt;G&gt;   And sometimes when I read the <br/>\nboards you guys who&#39;ve been at it for a while  sound so sure of yourselves and <br/>\nI wonder if I lack something-- trust? in my  kids? in myself?  <br/>\n <br/>\nBut I am definitely commited to unschooling.  And knowing that it was  hard <br/>\nfor others and that they made it definitely helps me to keep going.   And I <br/>\nknow what you mean about that fine line.  I think I have been good  about erring <br/>\non the side of caution, trying to offer variety and fun stuff  to do without <br/>\nturning into &quot;teacher-mom&quot;. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It gets better!
