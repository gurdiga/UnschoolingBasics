He has always been like this. He&#39;s much <br/>\nmore content to play by himself or with one or two other friends. <br/>\nThat&#39;s about it. It took my until this year to figure out the whole <br/>\none or two friend thing. It&#39;s just his personality. He told me just a<br/>\ncouple of weeks ago that he does not like parties. I don&#39;t know why<br/>\nI didn&#39;t figure it out sooner, but the signs were there. At least<br/>\nhe&#39;s in tune with himself enough to know. Large groups of people<br/>\njust stress him out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice is to not fret over it. Let your son lead the way. He<br/>\nknows where his comfort level is. It used to really bother me that<br/>\nAdrian wasn&#39;t more active in groups, but it&#39;s just not his bag. I&#39;m<br/>\nokay with that now. I should have learned from myself. Once I paid<br/>\nattention I realized that I&#39;m very similar to his personality, just<br/>\nnot quite as extreme. BUT, I don&#39;t like parties either...  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nThe part that jumped out at me was this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  At least he&#39;s in tune with himself enough to know.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the beauty of unschooling.  Here is a 10yo who is in tune <br/>\nwith himself enough to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wouldn&#39;t be in tune if his Mom made his choices about<br/>\nsocializing, (or TV or math or chores . . . .)<br/>\n<br/>\nLucky kid - that.  In tune with himself at 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nMercedes<br/>\nwho hates to admit how old she was before she even realized how much <br/>\nNOT being in tune with herself was affecting her relationships</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3026,"nextTopicId":3028}}
