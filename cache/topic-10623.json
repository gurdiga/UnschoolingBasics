I don&#39;t think I did an Intro <br/>\n anyway...<br/>\n <br/>\nWe are unschoolers and we follow many things that were listed as  neglect. We <br/>\nare a totally normal family with friends who unschool and  not.<br/>\nWe have four children, I own a business and run a state  unschooling list <br/>\nwith over 80 families and maintain two web sites.  <br/>\nWe own 4 dogs with champion lines and we sell pups 1-2 times a year.  My dh <br/>\nis a technician, can build houses and has many normal hobbies like  hunting, <br/>\nbuilding,cars and dogs..<br/>\nOur son 14.5 enjoys his friends of 6 years (mostly ps),computers, surfing  <br/>\n(water), biking, cooking (makes chili for events we attend and family  <br/>\nmeal)shopping,travel and has plans to build his own house when he gets  older.<br/>\nOur daughter 6 loves to draw, play, cook, help  mom,dolls, shopping,creating <br/>\nany thing, writing and travel.<br/>\nOur younger sons 4 (May 28th)and 2 (April)love cooking, outdoors,  snuggle <br/>\ntime, Thomas and creating.<br/>\nAll the kids help care/play with the puppies and dogs. They meet  our <br/>\ncustomers and are why we are successful in everything we do.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve worked out side the home for a newspaper and have owned a successful  <br/>\nhigh end toy store and.com. I choose to be home, it was a sacrifice income wise  <br/>\nbut worth it. We have found a happier/more peaceful life at home and our  <br/>\nchildren are free to choose to be home or not, food, tv ,bed  times,friends , <br/>\ncomputer time or whatever else they choose(which never  falls under free for all).<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve added links below..
