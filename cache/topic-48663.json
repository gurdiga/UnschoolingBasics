If you look around your area for an amateur astronomers association (just google that plus your place name) they will usually have a website/blog/Facebook and will inform you of stellar events coming up. Many also have events and activities for the entire family that can help grow your knowledge. Sometimes they will even help you with your equipment. It&#39;s a great place to find expertise. Even if you don&#39;t want to attend meetings or want to interact in person, usually they are also helpful via online means (at least in my experience with various groups in our state). <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Allyson &lt;rainbowartistally@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oops, I meant to say we do have a couple apps that show us what&#39;s in the<br/>\n&gt; sky.
