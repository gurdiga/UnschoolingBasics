THANK YOU, REN!  I am so inspired by this article and feel that I am so on the right track with unschooling and my relationships with my children in general.  I have truly received the greatest amount of healing from past childhood hurts since becoming a mother.  Unschooling is continuing that process and I am getting better and better as a result.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I have thought about is the story about the mother who acquired a horse for her children.  When I heard that the next Conference would be in AZ, I thought that chances of me and my family attending would be slim as I live in TN.  However, I am going to use creative thinking and figure out how I am going to make it there.  The discussion between Ren and Sandra Dodd made me realize that I NEED to attend the conference.  I will definitely be ordering a few of the CD&#39;s from the 2005 conference!<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch Love<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8693,"nextTopicId":8676}}
