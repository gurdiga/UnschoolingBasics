The ones who join the list not to explore  <br/>\nunschooling, but to try to question and criticize others&#39; choices in  <br/>\nan attempt to break them down.

When someones is &quot;asking for help&quot; then they should be able to read what helps them and delete what does not!  I have been to another group where I was not asking for help and posted &quot;curriculum for sale&quot; and that started a whole topic of debate.  Of Course I felt bad for pulling out all this advice and it seemed it was a &quot;sore spot&quot; in some of the responses with people too.  Even though it wasn&#39;t directed at &quot;me&quot; it was from what I posted.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I am sensitive and seems I need everything suggested in a &quot;sweet&quot; or &quot;polite&quot; manner.  I am working on that part. BUT I still don&#39;t understand why when people respond it has to be sounding like a &quot;pointing finger&quot; discussion.  Example: the &quot;you&quot; messages.  Instead of telling their opinions with a suggestive manner.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have enjoyed this groups readings so far and have seen this type of discussion and am amazed at all the different parenting styles.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Question:  IF someone is exploring Unschooling and is not on the same page as others should that person stay on this list? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Reason for this question is that I myself have been homeschooling and changing to &quot;unschooling&quot; since I had my two girls and always had the idea of parenting with respect and treating them like &quot;humans&quot; BUT (never in my dreams could imagine it turning into such a beautiful thing and how nice our days go and how easy most are with living our lives and enjoying time, play, exploring together.) I still have &quot;workbooks&quot; and coloring books and etc on my shelves........No we have not done them in a very, very long time its just where we were in that time and path of feeling out where we wanted to go?  Maybe this is what people talk about when parents have to &quot;deschool&quot; themselves.  So it is hard to ask questions and knowing where &quot;you&quot; are as you are writing it then to get a response back from someone who is SO confident doesn&#39;t quit respond with &quot;ideas&quot; it sounds like &quot;stone&quot; instead.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  smiles~ Angela<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13101,"nextTopicId":13078}}
