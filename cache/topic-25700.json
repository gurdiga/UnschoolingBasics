The email turns up every August.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something from Space Weather:<br/>\n<br/>\nSpace Weather News for August 4, 2007<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://spaceweather.com\">http://spaceweather.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBEWARE THE MARS HOAX: It&#39;s August, which means it&#39;s time for the  <br/>\nannual Mars Hoax. An email is going around claiming that Mars will  <br/>\napproach Earth on August 27th; the encounter will be so close, the  <br/>\nemail states, that Mars will rival the full Moon in size and  <br/>\nbrightness. (Imagine the tides!) Don&#39;t believe it. The Mars Hoax  <br/>\nemail first appeared in 2003. On August 27th of that year, Mars  <br/>\nreally did come historically close to Earth. But the email&#39;s claim  <br/>\nthat Mars would rival the Moon was grossly exaggerated. Every August  <br/>\nsince 2003, the email has staged a revival.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something that is true: Mars is having a close encounter with  <br/>\nthe Pleiades star cluster, easily seen in the eastern sky before  <br/>\nsunrise. Especially good mornings to look are August 6th and 7th when  <br/>\nthe crescent Moon joins the planet and the cluster to form a pretty  <br/>\ncelestial triangle. Set your alarm!<br/>\n<br/>\nMANMADE NOCTILUCENT CLOUDS:  This morning in Florida, NASA&#39;s Phoenix  <br/>\nMars lander blasted off from Cape Canaveral aboard a Delta II  <br/>\nrocket.  The rocket&#39;s exhaust created a beautiful display of  <br/>\nluminous, night-shining clouds.
