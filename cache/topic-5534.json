(heh, I can imagine just that<br/>\nstatement will spark all kinds of angry argument from y&#39;all).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there is such a continuum between just doing whatever you want all the time and having someone else telling you what to do and you resenting it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt our house, we tried many, many ways of doing things before we found one that works, at least for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was planning to do most things myself and simply be satisfied if the kids chose on their own to help, I was worked into the ground, the house was a mess and the kids were bored senseless because I didn&#39;t have time to do fun stuff with them.  The kids were making messes faster than I could clean them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I simply asked the kids to help when I needed it, we had a mixed response.  I got lots of &#39;no&#39; answers because the kids were busy and didn&#39;t want to stop to help.  I felt angry and resentful and the house was still a mess and I was still to rushed to have fun with my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe finally sat down and talked, all of us (5 kids and 2 adults), with everyone talking about what they like, don&#39;t like, priorities, etc..  The kids were able to understand that I need help around the house if I am going to have time to run to the library, park, friends&#39; houses, club activities, etc..  They could hear that laundry still needs to be done, dishes washed, animals fed, grass mowed, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nI was able to understand that the kids felt like I was nagging at them to pick up throughout the day, that they didn&#39;t want to stop a game to do a mundane task. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were all able to understand that dh, who is slightly compulsive, poor dear, would feel very frazzled walking into a messy, crazy, knee deep in projects house.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we worked the idea of &quot;the list&quot;.  It took lots of tweaking to make sure everyone was happy. Basically, I make a &quot;to do&quot; list each night for everyone in the family.  It consists of all the things we need to take care of the next day, fun stuff mixed with menial stuff, just things that need to get taken care of.  If Adriane is needing to call a friend about a party, it is right on the list next to straighten the living room.  I ask each kid to straighten one room each day and they are willing to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis way all of our needs are being met.  Does that mean that when Adriane straightens the living room she is doing it because she would rather do that than anything else?  Probably not.  But she was willing to compromise with me, to listen to me because I listen to her.  She was able to see that she contributes to the straightening that needs to be done and is willing to be a part of the solution.  She is happy because she knows what needs to be done first thing in the morning (ok at the crack of noon which is when she usually gets up&lt;grin&gt;) and is able to plan her day around that without interruptions from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, June 08, 2005 10:44 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Ideas for word play<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: jmr1290 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jomarex@...\">jomarex@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling, in *some* ways, seems like a direction we need to go, but<br/>\n  I know from long experience that most of the time, he wants to<br/>\n  skateboard or watch TV more than anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  What do YOU want to do more than anything else?

Often<br/>\npeople are so entrenched in the way they speak to *children* that they don&#39;t<br/>\neven see it as negative.  Think to yourself, would you speak to a good<br/>\nfriend that way?  Or even a perfect stranger?  If you are trying to be<br/>\noverly controlling, your kids will call you on it.  IF you aren&#39;t being<br/>\nreasonable to them, they will call you on it.  Do you have good reasons for<br/>\nthe things you ask him?  Can he understand them?  I also don&#39;t see you<br/>\nbacking down from an argument yourself, if you are saying to your child,<br/>\n&quot;you always have to argue with everything I say, don&#39;t you?&quot;.

Sometimes<br/>\nJayn, even now still at 5.5 and certainly at 4.5, gets confused about some<br/>\nwords and tenses. She will say things like &quot;bigger&quot; when she means<br/>\n&quot;smaller&quot;, or &quot;yesterday&quot; when she means &quot;tomorrow&quot;. Sometimes she hasn&#39;t<br/>\nthe vocabulary for detail, but will find she wants to clarify and searches<br/>\nfor the phrase. In those instances she often reacts negatively to my<br/>\nsuggestions of other ways to express.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;m looking at this story in the context of some of the other stuff<br/>\nyou were saying, and I have a theory - it may be bunk, but it may be<br/>\nsomething to consider. Maybe Mikey feels that he is not getting sufficient<br/>\namounts of your attention because of his siblings, so he wanted to &quot;pretend<br/>\nthem away&quot; in this instance rather than have a conversation with you about<br/>\nCaroline. In this way by saying he &quot;hadn&#39;t seen them&quot; maybe he was trying a<br/>\ncode for, &quot;I wish you hadn&#39;t seen them and gotten distracted from me&quot; or<br/>\nsomething similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I can&#39;t support Jayn in her version of &quot;facts&quot; because she is incorrect,<br/>\nI still try hard not to make her feel in the wrong. I will be non-committal<br/>\nin my response. In something like the above situation I would probably have<br/>\nsaid &quot;Oh&quot; and moved on to the other topics. Jayn would be likely to then say<br/>\n&quot;Only kidding, I did see them&quot; with a great giggle, but if she didn&#39;t it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t really change the conversation right then. The best time to ask her<br/>\n*why* she said she hadn&#39;t seen them would be later at night while having a<br/>\nsnuggle together.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Before I let go of tv controls, he would get upset at the end of a <br/>\nshow and say &quot;I want to watch something else.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you mean he would want to change the channel because he wasn&#39;t pleased<br/>\nwith whatever the next program was, or was he upset that the prior show had<br/>\nended? <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn has only just recently become interested in using the remote control<br/>\nherself, since she now recognizes all the numbers. Usually she still prefers<br/>\none of us to change the channel for her. (&quot;I&#39;m too floppy&quot; is her code for<br/>\neither &quot;I&#39;m tired&quot; or &quot;I just want some pampering for a moment&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The more positive and gentle we are with him, the more we interact <br/>\nwith him before he really really NEEDS it, the more pleasant he is. <br/>\nBut with the baby and a 2 yr old struggling with the existance of <br/>\nsaid baby, he&#39;s not getting enough attention and yes, really does <br/>\nturn to behaviors more likely to get a response from us, even if <br/>\nit&#39;s negative. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYour response does not have to be negative.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jayn in a sudden fury calls me &quot;you bitch&quot; - usually because her sock<br/>\nhas gotten tangled or some other minor glitch absolutely not related to my<br/>\nactions - saying &quot;that hurts my feelings&quot; hasn&#39;t penetrated. So I decided<br/>\nevery time she did that she would get (&quot;oh no, look out&quot;) a raspberry blown<br/>\non her tummy. Frustration instantly becomes hilarity. We have had a couple<br/>\nof &quot;bitch&quot;/raspberry festivals, and now I see her visibly stop and hold back<br/>\nfrom calling me the name. Hugs ensue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must say that in the throes of feeling annoyed was *not* when I came up<br/>\nwith the raspberry idea. It was an inspiration that came to me in a quiet<br/>\nmoment of reflection on the problem. I was basically asking myself, &quot;what<br/>\nloving (as in showing love) action can I take when Jayn does this particular<br/>\nunlovable thing?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that I am more serene if I have a plan. What are the specific<br/>\nbehaviors that seem to call out a negative emotion and response from you? If<br/>\nyou are stuck, maybe we can all brainstorm some positive loving actions<br/>\ninstead. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

It seems to have popped up a couple of times<br/>\nrecently on different lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly it seems like you are choosing to ascribe a negative desire or<br/>\nnegative character trait to you smart, witty, verbal, humorous son. A lie is<br/>\nonly a lie if he is actually trying to deceive rather than say, entertain or<br/>\nfantasize - if he expects you to believe it and thus act on it. Jayn talks<br/>\nabout her imaginary friend, Googly, a lot - but she and I know Googly is<br/>\npretend (or maybe a non-corporeal spirit guide)....  <br/>\n<br/>\nAre you really trying to say that he wants a negative response - to make you<br/>\nangry or irritated or impatient? If that is the case, I would say that that<br/>\nis a call for *you* to give him a positive and loving response and to get to<br/>\nthe bottom of why he is feeling that need.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr looking at &quot;negative attention&quot; as a parental choice, instead of a<br/>\nchild&#39;s desire, you can still choose neutrality or compassion. &quot;Whine&quot; is a<br/>\nnegative word. Does he even realize that he sounds unpleasant, or is it a<br/>\nsign that he is close to overwhelmed, or tired, or hungry, or lonely, or<br/>\nleft out, or something else specific to his situation? When Jayn sounds that<br/>\ngratingly high pitched way, I choose to regard it as one of the above,<br/>\nrather than a deliberately chosen strategy for attaining some goal. You can<br/>\nchoose to respond neutrally, to the underlying need, without taking it<br/>\npersonally.

But he <br/>\nplays lots of games with language at our expense. He&#39;s more interested <br/>\nin telling a good story than telling the truth sometimes, he&#39;ll argue <br/>\nfor the fun of it quite often, he&#39;ll whine about what&#39;s on tv instead <br/>\nof changing the channel himself, etc. All ways of getting <br/>\nattention...negative attention, unfortunately. He&#39;s gotten so in to <br/>\nthe habit of doing these things that I want to try to find some <br/>\nalternative games for him to play. (Reading this over, I know it <br/>\nsounds like normal kid stuff. It&#39;s the quantity of it that overwhelms <br/>\nme. And it&#39;s waaay past my bedtime, so I&#39;m probably sounding more <br/>\nnegative than I normally would...)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe went through a period of telling lots of jokes, esp. knock knock <br/>\njokes. We&#39;ve looked at web sites for them and I just bought a book, <br/>\nbut it seemed like a lot of them were over his head. I thought he <br/>\nwould like tongue twisters, but he gives up very easily on them. I <br/>\njust got a book of nursery rhymes with lots of pictures. He&#39;s reading <br/>\na few words now and starting to guess at what words might be, so I <br/>\nthought he might want to read/recite the rhymes to his little brother <br/>\nand sister. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m looking other ideas of things to do with him while I&#39;m <br/>\nchanging lots of diapers or ploughing a path through the toys in the <br/>\nliving room! We haven&#39;t played &quot;I spy&quot; in a while, so I&#39;ll give that a <br/>\ntry.
