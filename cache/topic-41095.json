The more proactive you can be the happier you&#39;ll be - look for ways to meet his needs *before* he&#39;s hitting you. Observe carefully what kinds of big muscle movements he enjoys and look for ways for him to use those muscle groups that don&#39;t include hurting people. If he likes punching, encourage him to punch pillows and other &quot;safe&quot; things - I don&#39;t just mean when he punches you to try to redirect him. I mean fill his day with offers and suggestions for the kind of fun he likes. Give him sticks to whack down weeds, soft things to pinch in his fingers, hold a couch cushion and encourage him to head-butt it. Brainstorm a list for yourself and hang it up somewhere you can see it. Any time he&#39;s not all wrapped up in something, offer some new, big muscle action. Some kids need a lot of big muscle stimulation - either as a phase or as an aspect of their temperament. Ray *still* needs big muscle stimulation... as I&#39;m typing he&#39;s in the workshop downstairs pounding something on his new anvil!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he&#39;s punching/kicking/hitting/pinching/head butting<br/>\n&gt; me: auggie, that hurts, please stop. please give me nice touches.<br/>\n&gt; auggie: &lt;smirks, stares me in the eye and keeps doing it&gt;<br/>\n&gt; me: you are hurting my body and my feelings.  please stop<br/>\n&gt; auggie:&lt;same, possibly worse&gt; it doesn&#39;t hurt you<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*Does* it hurt you? If he&#39;s actively hurting you, then saying &quot;stop&quot; in a nice voice isn&#39;t helpful. You&#39;re giving him conflicting messages. If you&#39;re hurt say &quot;hey, that hurts&quot; in a loud, firm tone right off the bat. Learn to block punches safely if you need to, until you can figure out the proactive part of dealing with his needs, but don&#39;t let him hurt you. That&#39;s not good for either of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids, even adults can smirk or smile under stress. I have a strong impulse to laugh under stress that I&#39;ve learned to control bc its just soooooooo socially inappropriate. I once read that smiling has evolved from an expression some mammals use to show submissiveness - which may or may not be true, but I find it interesting in this context. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so i try to redirect, he escalates in the severity and frequency of his aggression.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i then change to demanding<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Part of the problem may be that you&#39;re using an approach that&#39;s too verbal. Shorten the whole interaction down to: &quot;stop, do this instead&quot; and then *give* him something else to hit, right then and there. Or wrap him up in a big playful hug and wrestle him so he gets the big, physical stimulation he needs in a different way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the important part is the proactive part. If he has poor impulse control, then by the time he&#39;s hitting he has none at all - so redirecting is going to be hard, at best. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; having him screened for sensory disorders<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whether or not he has a sensory delay/disorder, being proactive is the most important thing you can do for him. And either way, I totally recommend you read &quot;The Out of Sync Child&quot; for its wonderful lists of activities. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: pinching, hitting etc Re: [unschoolingbasics] +Re:unschooling and toddlers","postDate":"1250636187","msgId":41101,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2MDA2RDAxLTNGNDktNEI4RC04QkUxLTEwODkyRUE1RUVCMEBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGg2ZTRrNCtmMGZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg2ZTRrNCtmMGZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41098,"nextInTopic":41102,"prevInTime":41100,"nextInTime":41102,"topicId":41095,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Chrissy, that s hard.
