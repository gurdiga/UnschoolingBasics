If we can show them compassion and understanding at those times, we <br/>\ncan teach them by example some of the most essential ingredients of a happy <br/>\nlife: the capacity to love others unconditionally, the willingness to offer <br/>\nhelp and express empathy at all times, and not just at those times when <br/>\nothers are making life easy for us. If we can teach this to our children, we <br/>\nhave given our child a priceless gift, one that will continue through the <br/>\ngenerations. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;One of the most important principles of parenting is that the feelings <br/>\nbehind a child&#39;s behavior must be recognized, accepted, understood, and <br/>\nopenly dealt with, before the behavior can change. Until that happens, the <br/>\nunwanted behavior - or behavior even less welcome to the parent - will only <br/>\ncontinue. How could it be otherwise? It is the same with adults, after all. <br/>\nIf we &quot;misbehave&quot; toward our partner, but he or she makes no effort to <br/>\nunderstand and accept the feelings which brought about that behavior, and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t hear the message we are trying to send, we will continue to try to <br/>\nexpress those feelings in the same, or even less effective and less welcome <br/>\nways.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Feelings are not &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;; they are normal, valid, and important. I <br/>\nlove you enough to stop and really pay attention to what it is you&#39;re trying <br/>\nto tell me, in the only way you can tell me in this moment, at this age, and <br/>\nin these circumstances. I do not like being bitten any more than you would <br/>\nlike it. At the same time, I understand that you would not have done this <br/>\nunless you were feeling angry/ sad/ upset/ worried/ disturbed about <br/>\nsomething. I take your needs and feelings seriously, and I&#39;ll help you to <br/>\nfind better ways to express your feelings so that everyone&#39;s needs are <br/>\nmet.&quot;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;One of our Natural Child Project Parenting CardsÂ© sums it up this way: <br/>\n&quot;Look past the behavior... what is your child feeling?&quot; When we focus on a <br/>\nchild&#39;s needs and feelings, rather than the specific behavior we wish to <br/>\nchange, we can then truly communicate our love for our child. That the <br/>\nbehavior will then improve is almost a side issue. As Mozart wrote, &quot;Love, <br/>\nlove, love, that is the soul of genius.&quot; It is also the soul of parenting.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;and this article;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.org/jan_hunt/misunderstand.html\">http://www.naturalchild.org/jan_hunt/misunderstand.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAlex</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13400,"nextTopicId":13389}}
