He would spout off all<br/>\nsorts of interesting factoids about weapons at the darndest times.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s been a pretty serious gamer for many years now...I haven&#39;t seen<br/>\nany &quot;waning&quot; of the hours he spends on games and computers, but that&#39;s<br/>\nhis life.  He&#39;s mega into technology, has learned to build and repair<br/>\ncomputers and loves the complicated games. He&#39;s also very willing to<br/>\nwalk away if we have interesting plans, or to help me out if I need it.<br/>\nSo while there is no &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; syndrome going on, that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily mean a waning in time spent on an activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think if a parent is waiting around for a child to spend less<br/>\ntime on ANYTHING, that is the wrong attitude.
