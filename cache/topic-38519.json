Please please  <br/>\nconsider dropping us a few lines on how you manage to reconcile  <br/>\nfinances/your job with unschooling (because of time or finances).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answers will be translated into German and printed in the German  <br/>\nmagazine &quot;unerzogen&quot;, which is about unschooling, democratic education  <br/>\nand respectful parenting. Please not that I will NOT change your  <br/>\nquotes (maybe I&#39;ll have to<br/>\nshorten them, then I&#39;ll ask for your permission). I&#39;m fully supportive  <br/>\nof unschooling and promise not to twist any answers as to depict  <br/>\nunschooling as &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; or anything. So far, we have printed  <br/>\narticles/interviews from: Joyce Fetteroll, Kelly Lovejoy and Sandra  <br/>\nDodd.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow you&#39;ll find more details!

Did you<br/>\nchange or quit your job? do you get help? what about your partner?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are willing to give me quotable answers, please write to me to<br/>\ndialog @ unerzogen . de<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your support! Unschooling (homeschooling even) is illegal<br/>\nin Germany. Please help us contribute to inform people about<br/>\nunschooling ideas by sending me answers that I can use :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case my questions are not clear, here are possible answers, so you<br/>\ncan see what I&#39;m looking for:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I quit my job and my husband works. We&#39;ve cut back and live in a<br/>\nsmaller flat so we can finance unschooling&quot;.<br/>\n&quot;We both work and do this in different shifts so that most of the time<br/>\nsomeone is at home with the kids&quot;<br/>\n&quot;We have a problem and have not come up with a solution yet, but we&#39;re<br/>\nworking on it&quot;<br/>\n&quot;We have an network of unschooling friends and try to help each other<br/>\nout&quot;<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I&#39;m not looking for people who fit my answers -- these were<br/>\nrather jus examples. I&#39;m looking for real solutions that you&#39;ve come<br/>\nup with. Or maybe even different ways to approach this &quot;problem&quot; (like<br/>\nnot seeing it as a problem?..) The answers should not be too long, so<br/>\nI can quote many different unschoolers on one page.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38471,"nextTopicId":38490}}
