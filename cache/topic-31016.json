I&#39;ve been in this situation because <br/>\nmy kids can always outlast me when we&#39;re staying up late.  Since you <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel he is safe alone perhaps in the living room (?), then <br/>\ngive him a safe space to be in.  Does he share a room with his <br/>\nbrother?  My two daughters, ages 10 and 15, share a room by choice.  <br/>\nNoise and lights don&#39;t bother either one of them so it&#39;s okay that <br/>\nthey don&#39;t keep the same hours.  My dd10 regularly stays up until <br/>\n1:00am or 2:00am, way beyond when I&#39;ve dropped off.  She has <br/>\neverything she needs in her room though.  She has a tv with cable, <br/>\nher own computer and a desk where she can do art.  I&#39;m not saying <br/>\nevery child needs these particular things, but they are things that <br/>\nmy dd10 enjoys.  She also reads or plays her Nintendo DS in bed.  <br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t mind staying up in her own room, though we&#39;re fine with <br/>\nher being in the living room if she chose to do so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy ds11 doesn&#39;t like being up at night if my DH or I are not awake.  <br/>\nHe reads in bed for a short while and then goes to sleep.  He also <br/>\nhas a tv, computer, all his toys, and a desk, but he doesn&#39;t like <br/>\nbeing out of bed.  He and his younger sister wouldn&#39;t mind staying <br/>\nawake together but they know they tend to get loud and they don&#39;t <br/>\nlike to disturb their dad&#39;s sleep.  DH wakes early in the mornings.  <br/>\nOccasionally, I&#39;ll stay up later and the three of us (two kids and <br/>\nmyself) will do quiet things.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you can talk with your son to see what he&#39;d like to do when <br/>\nyou are ready for bed.  If he wants to watch tv but there isn&#39;t one <br/>\nin his room, can you give him a small tv that plays DVDs if he can&#39;t <br/>\nhave cable?  Does he have a handheld game system that he&#39;d like to <br/>\nplay?  Does he like puzzle books?  How about a deck of cards to play <br/>\nsolitaire?  A sketch book and drawing pencil?  A set of magnetix or <br/>\na small lego kit?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo his hours bother you?  If he&#39;s entertained in bed, he might stay <br/>\nup later and sleep longer in the morning.  My dd10 sleeps until <br/>\nabout 12 noon nearly every day.  It used to bother my DH because he <br/>\nfelt like she was sleeping away the day.  I had to help him see that <br/>\nshe is getting the sleep her body needs and it doesn&#39;t matter if <br/>\nit&#39;s 1:00am to 12 noon or 9:00pm to 8:00am.  I too need 10 - 11 <br/>\nhours of sleep per day but I do it in two shifts.  I sleep from <br/>\nabout 11:00pm to 7:00am, and take a nap in the late morning around <br/>\n10:00am.  I know my dd10 actually enjoys the quiet hours at night to <br/>\nfocus on things for herself.  I feel the same way about my morning <br/>\nhours from 7:00am to 10:00am.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Newbie with questions about unschooly bedtimes and food","postDate":"1205890142","msgId":31086,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk1QUQ1NjQxLTcwRUUtNDgwQS1CQjBFLUNFQTlGQkRFQkUzNUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMDMxNi43NjQ3Mi5xbUB3ZWI1MjQwMS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDEzMDMxNi43NjQ3Mi5xbUB3ZWI1MjQwMS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":31082,"nextInTopic":31087,"prevInTime":31085,"nextInTime":31087,"topicId":31016,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I could find no research linking beta casein<br/>\nto sleep disturbances and I wonder if perhaps a link was made in the<br/>\nwrong place.  Often (when I was a vet tech) people would tell me their<br/>\ndog knows when it&#39;s been bad.

At ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-615392698\">I have to argue that choosing &quot;no milk&quot; will come<br/>\neventually. My son loved milk.. he&#39;d drink it all day<br/>\nlong. But he also never slept a night in his life. At<br/>\nfirst, the doctor (and everyone else) said that he was<br/>\na baby and needed to settle down to a schedule. But<br/>\nthis went on for 5 years.. he&#39;d wake up 4-8 times a<br/>\nnight crying. A sip or two of milk would put him right<br/>\nback to sleep, only to wake up again another hour or<br/>\ntwo later. Eventually, the doctor blamed me.... trying<br/>\nto insist that I was doing something wrong that was<br/>\nmaking my son wake up so frequently.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter 5 years of this, I took away all milk products.<br/>\nYes, my son was unhappy. And no, he didn&#39;t adjust to<br/>\nany of the &quot;alternative milks&quot;. But you know what?<br/>\nThree nights later, he was sleeping through the night.<br/>\nAnd he sleeps soundly through the night, every night<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year, we decided to try milk again. You&#39;d not<br/>\nbelieve how happy my son was. But all it took was a<br/>\nfew days. Each night got a little worse. From restless<br/>\nsleeping, to moaning and groaning in his sleep.<br/>\nFinally, he woke up screaming one night and threw up<br/>\nall over. That is what milk does to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I understand that normal children can be talked to<br/>\nand have things explained. But my son is autistic, and<br/>\ndid not understand that cow milk makes him sick. He&#39;s<br/>\n9 now, and has been told that cow dairy makes him sick<br/>\n(he repeats it to me all the time), and I think he<br/>\nunderstands. I learned, after researching, that my son<br/>\ncannot digest the fat globules of cow milk. He is,<br/>\nhowever, fine with goat milk. Hence, I allow him all<br/>\nthe goat dairy he&#39;d like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like unschooling, and I firmly believe that children<br/>\nneed to be allowed to make their choices. But this is<br/>\none area, for us, that got dealt with in this manner.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure I could have used a better approach, but I&#39;ve<br/>\nonly started unschooling for a little over a year,<br/>\nwhereas my son has been off cow dairy for 5 years. I<br/>\ndid what I thought of at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Sorry if this comes across as aggressive. I really<br/>\ndon&#39;t mean it to be.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and <br/>\nknow-it-all with Yahoo!

We pulled out DS1 7 weeks ago and three weeks ago<br/>\nwent to unschooling. I have read tons and am slowly &quot;getting it&quot; but<br/>\nstill have many moments where I don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you get an 8yo, who is still awake when the parents need to<br/>\nsleep, to go to bed ?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe removed limits to TV watching three weeks ago and it&#39;s been pretty<br/>\nmuch wall-to-wall TV since then. That&#39;s OK. Last week, I decided to<br/>\ntry removing the bedtimes, letting them watch TV until they were ready<br/>\nto go to bed. The limit I put on it was that it was to be quiet time<br/>\nin preparation for bed and they had to go to their rooms when we (the<br/>\nadults) wanted to go to bed as it wasn&#39;t safe for them at their age to<br/>\nbe up with no adults around. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first night, I wanted to go to bed at 10pm and they went to their<br/>\nrooms and read until they were sleepy. A success. Second night, I<br/>\nturned the TV off at 8:30pm because they were rough housing and they<br/>\nwent to their rooms to read quietly until they were ready to sleep.<br/>\nThird night, DS2 took himself off to bed but DS1 was still awake at<br/>\n10:30pm and refused to go to his room when I needed to go to bed. This<br/>\nset up a power struggle with me staying firm with the limit and him<br/>\nlying on the floor refusing to move. It was really unpleasant at that<br/>\ntime of night. I want to respect his need to choose but also he needs<br/>\nto be safe and I don&#39;t feel he is when I am in bed. He&#39;s also waking<br/>\nup later and later which makes it harder and harder for him to go to<br/>\nsleep earlier than his parents so I feel I need to do something<br/>\ndifferent before things get worse. <br/>\n<br/>\nIfeel like I&#39;m doing something wrong here. Are my limits reasonable?<br/>\nToo reasonable for kids their age? Do I just need to keep reinforcing<br/>\nwhat is acceptable/safe to me? Perhaps I&#39;m doing something wrong<br/>\nearlier in the day? And what to do when he struggles with me? <br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice would be much appreciated, thanks for listening..<br/>\n<br/>\nAlison</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31078,"nextTopicId":31008}}
