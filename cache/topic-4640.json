For <br/>\n  those of you that don&#39;t know me, my name is Tina.  Adrian, 11 next <br/>\n  month, and I have been unschooling for the past year.  Before that <br/>\n  he did school at home and before that public school.  It&#39;s been an <br/>\n  interesting journey to this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Life has gotten complicated for us.  He suffered a trauma this past <br/>\n  summer.  I believe (know) he is depressed.  On top of everything my <br/>\n  dad is dying of male breast cancer.  I am his only biological child <br/>\n  and his primary care giver.  This takes up a tremendous amount of my <br/>\n  time.  I managed to get Mondays &quot;free&quot; from going to my dad&#39;s, and <br/>\n  Thursdays I only have to go at night.  So, I make it a point to be <br/>\n  as available as possible on those days.  The other, more hectic, <br/>\n  days I make myself available as much as possible.  With demands of <br/>\n  children in public school, my &quot;fiance&#39;&quot;, six other children, two of <br/>\n  them continuing their education beginning this week, things are just <br/>\n  crazy.  Oh, and I just found out that I&#39;m going to be a grandma this <br/>\n  year at the ripe old age of 34!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, given the above information, I tend to get a case of the <br/>\n  guilts and second guessing how well I&#39;m doing what I &quot;do&quot; with my <br/>\n  unschooled son.  Are there any of you out there that have words of <br/>\n  wisdom to share?  I try to take comfort in knowing that he&#39;s totally <br/>\n  into PS2, Adult Swim, Fresh Prince, movies, etc.  These are all <br/>\n  solitary things that keep him alone in his room most of the time.  I <br/>\n  know it&#39;s okay, but I do worry sometimes.  Yes, I do join him in his <br/>\n  room to watch movies, check out his hamsters, prepare for his <br/>\n  leopard gecko or just watch him play GTA San Andreas.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  These are the things that I wonder:  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Is there ever a time when it&#39;s not &quot;normal&quot; anymore?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  He&#39;s going to counseling in regard to his trauma and depression <br/>\n  beginning February 3rd.  What should I be concerned about in <br/>\n  relation to unschooling and this situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Is there something that I should be doing more of given that I&#39;m so <br/>\n  pre-occupied with caring for my father?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve not been restricting his viewing or game playing, and I&#39;m okay <br/>\n  with that.  BUT, what about the colorful vocabulary he&#39;s learned at <br/>\n  such a young age and his rather synical attitude?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  What about friends?  Is it okay that he doesn&#39;t have a single one?  <br/>\n  He doesn&#39;t really do or participate in anything so there&#39;s no <br/>\n  opportunity to meet anyone and form relationships?  Does it really <br/>\n  matter?  He is, I believe, highly sensitive.  It fits his <br/>\n  personality to not like crowds and things like parties.  When should <br/>\n  I be concerned?  Should I ever?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, I hope someone out there can make sense of my ramblings.  <br/>\n  It&#39;s just a VERY tough time right now, and without being around <br/>\n  experienced unschoolers and others living this lifestyle, heck Pat <br/>\n  doesn&#39;t even know what I&#39;m doing, it can be a bit daunting at <br/>\n  times.  Normally, I try to read a lot, but time is just not <br/>\n  available for that right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for your insight...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
