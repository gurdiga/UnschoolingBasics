My kids spend a lot of time *working*, spending, <br/>\nredecorating, building and playing with others.  They love the Wheel of WOW and Gem <br/>\nHunt. From the many hours I&#39;ve spent on Webkinz, I see no threat of danger.  My <br/>\nonly problem with it is the burger making job.

He can&#39;t strip her <br/>\nwebkin of its bathing suit or drive to your house.

As  <br/>\nfar as I can tell, it is a craze around here.  Every child I meet  <br/>\nlately has multiple Webkinz animals.  Anyway, it&#39;s a &#39;beanie baby&quot;- <br/>\ntype stuffed animal that you buy at the store.  It comes with a tag  <br/>\nthat has a code that you can use on the internet.  Once you register  <br/>\nyou can take care of your animal - feed it, bathe it, buy items for  <br/>\nit, etc.  You generate &quot;money&quot; to buy these things by playing games  <br/>\nand winning points.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, based on many of the recent threads on this list, I&#39;ve been  <br/>\ntrying really hard to be relaxed about this game, as well as computer  <br/>\nuse in general, which I have made some strides on.  So, I decided to  <br/>\ntry to appreciate certain benefits of the game, and I found some.   <br/>\nFor example, it has been a very social outlet for her, enabling her  <br/>\nto talk to some children she had a harder time with in the past.   <br/>\nAnother example would be the day she came to me and was telling me  <br/>\nabout someone who had 500,000 points and I realized that she had seen  <br/>\nand understood that number.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne aspect of the website is that you can email friends on your  <br/>\n&quot;friends list&quot; (it&#39;s essentially an Instant Messaging training  <br/>\nsystem).  I was fine with this because she was getting the names of  <br/>\nher friends and putting them on her list.  But now I found out that  <br/>\nyou can go to a &quot;Tournament Arena&quot;, play games against others (that  <br/>\nyou don&#39;t know) and &quot;meet&quot; them.  She was telling me about someone  <br/>\nshe was playing against (a game involving putting on dress-up clothes  <br/>\non your animal) and that this person asked Tess to be on her friends  <br/>\nlist.  Tess said, &quot;I said no, but I hope she asks me again because  <br/>\nI&#39;ll say yes next time&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I realized that she is imagining this person as a &quot;girl&quot;,  <br/>\nprobably as a 7 yo girl just like her, and that this is a friend  <br/>\n(just like a 7 yo girl that she might meet in the park and become  <br/>\n&quot;instant friends&quot; with for the moment that we are at the park).  But  <br/>\nI started thinking that we really have no idea who this person is  <br/>\n(when it&#39;s the park situation you really do know that the stranger is  <br/>\na 7 yo girl because you can see her, and become her &quot;friend&quot;, but on  <br/>\nthe internet this person could be absolutely anyone.  But, she has an  <br/>\nimage in her mind of safety.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I told her that talking to people on the internet is just like  <br/>\nmeeting someone in the store or the park (for example Tess will not  <br/>\ntell someone her name when she meets them unless she checks with me  <br/>\nfirst) and that I would like to explore this part of Webkinz with her  <br/>\nbefore she adds anyone to her list.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, I saw her list and it&#39;s got a lot of people on it.  Some  <br/>\nof them are strangers she has met online (she told me), some of them  <br/>\nare our neighbors and other friends.  I decided not to say much,  <br/>\nbecause she was in the middle of a playdate, but I would like to talk  <br/>\nto her about this more.  I didn&#39;t get a chance to talk to her before  <br/>\nbed and now I&#39;ve woken up in the middle of the night and I can&#39;t go  <br/>\nback to sleep because it&#39;s on my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should say that the only email communication that I see on this  <br/>\nwebsite is from pre-programmed lists of messages that you choose  <br/>\nfrom.  But, I don&#39;t know the website well enough, yet, to know if she  <br/>\ncan type in her own messages.  Even if the communication is strictly  <br/>\npre-programmed, I am concerned about a slippery slope effect.  I  <br/>\nworry that this is dulling her to the idea that she can talk to  <br/>\nanyone on the internet, and making it feel very safe for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any advice/comments you all have!<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie (in NJ)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23226,"nextTopicId":23202}}
