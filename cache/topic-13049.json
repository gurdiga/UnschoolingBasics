However, the law does<br/>\npermit, for example, the administering of a 2nd grade level test to a 13<br/>\nyear old who is functioning academically at the 2nd grade level.  Note that<br/>\nthe science and social studies sections of the test are *recommended* but<br/>\nare *not required* *by statute*.  In addition, North Carolina home school<br/>\nlaw does not mandate that the student achieve a certain minimum score on the<br/>\nnationally standardized test in order for the parent/guardian to be legally<br/>\npermitted to continue to home school that student during the following (or<br/>\nany future) school year.  Non-reader test editions are permitted and are<br/>\navailable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich makes me ask, &quot;WTF?????&quot;  OK, special needs children in public school<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to take annual tests.  A homeschooled child can be tested at any<br/>\nlevel (apparently), tests scores do not limit a parent&#39;s right to teach (so<br/>\na child could &quot;flunk&quot; the test and still continue to homeschool) and the<br/>\ntest scores are only required to be turned if asked.  So what&#39;s the<br/>\npoint?  This is, oh please let me say the word, stupid!
