The raw milk law is about money pure and simple <br/>\n&gt; (large <br/>\n&gt; dairies must pasteurize because their milk is old by the time it <br/>\n&gt; gets <br/>\n&gt; to the store, I sell it within 24 hours of being milked out).  <br/>\n&gt; Large <br/>\n&gt; dairies can pay for lobbyists, I don&#39;t have the time or energy to <br/>\n&gt; raise those kinds of funds or to raise that kind of awareness.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So I do what I think is best for me and mine and leave it at <br/>\n&gt; that.  <br/>\n&gt; If other people are happy with the laws, they should follow them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Julie S.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree with you on this Julie.  But I have to say that, to my <br/>\n&gt; knowledge, selling raw milk is not against the law--at least not <br/>\n&gt; here <br/>\n&gt; in Maine.  My ex-husband and I did it, his parents did it, and I <br/>\n&gt; know <br/>\n&gt; of several dairy farms that sell directly from their bulk tank <br/>\n&gt; before <br/>\n&gt; they ship it.  (Well that&#39;s against the law if they have a <br/>\n&gt; contract)  <br/>\n&gt; But beyond that, I know of at least one local dairy that still <br/>\n&gt; bottles, ships AND delivers their own UNpasteurized milk.  It has <br/>\n&gt; been my experience that it is more difficult to educate people <br/>\n&gt; regarding the pros and cons of pasteurization vs non because of <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; propaganda (scare tactics) that have been pushed by big <br/>\n&gt; comglomerates.  Like you said, I don&#39;t have the time or energy either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Public school has been used to indoctrinate so much into this <br/>\n&gt; society, and to perpetuate so many myths, it is scary IMHO.  <br/>\n&gt; (pasteurization, radon, and the list is endless.) And I don&#39;t have <br/>\n&gt; much faith in the system either.  I have watched too many people <br/>\n&gt; run <br/>\n&gt; around in circles trying to change things within the system to <br/>\n&gt; little <br/>\n&gt; or no avail...It SEEMS like it was all set up to keep us busy, and <br/>\n&gt; thinking we can make a change, but it is all just a diversion. <br/>\n&gt; (Not <br/>\n&gt; that change CAN&#39;T be affected--it&#39;s just damned difficult)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; just my $.02<br/>\n&gt; Marge<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

But I have to say that, to my <br/>\nknowledge, selling raw milk is not against the law--at least not here <br/>\nin Maine.  My ex-husband and I did it, his parents did it, and I know <br/>\nof several dairy farms that sell directly from their bulk tank before <br/>\nthey ship it.  (Well that&#39;s against the law if they have a contract)  <br/>\nBut beyond that, I know of at least one local dairy that still <br/>\nbottles, ships AND delivers their own UNpasteurized milk.  It has <br/>\nbeen my experience that it is more difficult to educate people <br/>\nregarding the pros and cons of pasteurization vs non because of the <br/>\npropaganda (scare tactics) that have been pushed by big <br/>\ncomglomerates.  Like you said, I don&#39;t have the time or energy either.<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic school has been used to indoctrinate so much into this <br/>\nsociety, and to perpetuate so many myths, it is scary IMHO.  <br/>\n(pasteurization, radon, and the list is endless.) And I don&#39;t have <br/>\nmuch faith in the system either.  I have watched too many people run <br/>\naround in circles trying to change things within the system to little <br/>\nor no avail...It SEEMS like it was all set up to keep us busy, and <br/>\nthinking we can make a change, but it is all just a diversion.
