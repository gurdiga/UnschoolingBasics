So I explained it to him, but we have talked about it for<br/>\n&gt; nearly 2 years but just have not made that final leap yet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I made a split second decision on feb 1st 2010 and he has never returned,<br/>\n&gt; he has not wanted to and you cant even mention anything about returning<br/>\n&gt; either, its traumatic for him, like an abused victim. school words are a<br/>\n&gt; traumatic meaning for him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; with gabriel he is my 10 year old, since i have 4 children ages now 14, 10,<br/>\n&gt; 6 and 2 lol he didnt want to be the only in school and felt left out being<br/>\n&gt; in ps so he asked to hs so i said yes of course yay! lol no more other<br/>\n&gt; peoples schedules for me i have enough with many dr appointments and<br/>\n&gt; therapies with all the boys and myself, they have special needs, i call<br/>\n&gt; challenges, but anyways.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; with gabriel i asked him when he would like to leave he said let him finish<br/>\n&gt; out the year and so i did, so now he has started hus (home<br/>\n&gt; unschooling) since august 2010.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; sebastian has not gone to school yet and has no desires yippie and the<br/>\n&gt; school told me they cant even accomodate him even if i needed to put him in<br/>\n&gt; there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; so thats our expirience, my boys new about it, and with alfredo i made the<br/>\n&gt; decision to remove him because i think if i didnt that day he would have had<br/>\n&gt; a mental nervous break down and that is his health involved so thats where i<br/>\n&gt; needed to step in. with gabriel he chose to finish the year, but he has had<br/>\n&gt; no issues besides being super bored becuase they dont allow the advanced<br/>\n&gt; learners to move ahead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mari<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":88200716,"authorName":"onskates","from":"&quot;onskates&quot; &lt;onskates@...&gt;","profile":"onskates","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: taking my girls out of ps this week","postDate":"1292790805","msgId":45699,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGllbHE2bCtxcHViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluMTdaNGJBTXNibzRmOTdXTHpyaUtyNVpUSnZieGk4S2gycURQTUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":45698,"nextInTopic":45700,"prevInTime":45698,"nextInTime":45700,"topicId":45668,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"yur probably right. but i am not going to. i am doing my best though. i know for a fact they would just quit right out the minute i told them. then i think","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-349142814\">yur probably right. but i am not going to. i am doing my best though.<br/>\ni know for a fact they would just quit right out the minute i told them. then i think they would regret that. i know them. <br/>\n<br/>\ntrust is good. i get the drift of trust.  i may be a little messy about what i am doing here but the choice is a good one.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, kmlewpea &lt;kmlewpea@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Could you just ask then if/when they would like to transition back home?<br/>\n&gt;  Let them know the earliest day that you feel available for that and then<br/>\n&gt; let them pick a day (or not) from that day on?
