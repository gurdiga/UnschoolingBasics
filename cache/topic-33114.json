( I think we could sort of get a second channel but more fuzzy and without audio.) <br/>\nThen we got satellite, which was lovely. <br/>\nThen one year David took a different job to be closer to home and his ailing Dad and we couldn&#39;t afford the satellite TV so we went back to our one fuzzy channel.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe asked friends and family to record a few things they enjoyed if they were watching anyway and share with us.  We borrowed movies from friends.  We&#39;d invite people over to dinner and say &quot;Bring a movie!&quot; &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have cable now, happily, and a Netflix subscription and a change jar for renting movies from our local video store or for a night at the drive-in. <br/>\n <br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33100,"nextTopicId":33074}}
