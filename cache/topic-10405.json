If the <br/>\nquestions are coming from nosey strangers or well acting, intrusive, judgmental <br/>\nfamily or friends I offer very little if any response.  Sometimes a chuckle is <br/>\nenough of a response to end invasive questioning.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I was at the grocery store and the check out lady said dont you kids have <br/>\nschool today and they said we dont go to school  we learn at home and she said <br/>\nwow then why are you at the store in the  middle of the school day. I (who <br/>\nusually can get pretty rude if needed)  just ignored her. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe get a lot of questions, too.  My children are 8, 6 and 2 and I have <br/>\nnoticed that this year more than ever we are getting asked by all kinds of <br/>\nstrangers.  Almost daily.  The older they get the more people wonder why they aren&#39;t in <br/>\nschool.  If one is rude enough to ask beyond the initial &quot;No school today?&quot; <br/>\nquestion, like the lady did to your daughter, my favorite response is:  The <br/>\nchildren have a highly contagious infection so we have been banned from attending <br/>\nour usual activities.  Its called inquisitivitis.  Then we all giggle and <br/>\nsneeze.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA quick response to no school today is -- I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my children are made to feel even the slightest bit uncomfortable by an <br/>\ninquisitive stranger I usually protect them by pulling them close and sometimes <br/>\ngetting between them and the interrogator.  An elderly lady bugged my dd so I <br/>\ngrabbed my daughter and praised her for not talking to strangers.  We both <br/>\nsmiled and I thanked the lady for bagging.  I think some people just don&#39;t <br/>\nrealize what they are doing.  For a milder approach to the not-so-bright I respond - <br/>\nOur family homeschools.  If someone asked us why we were in the store in the <br/>\nmiddle of the day I might say - We&#39;re shopping.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to keep a sense of humor about it.  As my kids get older they are coming <br/>\nup with their own responses.  No school today?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI love &quot;I&#39;m too cool for school&quot; that someone posted.  My kids will love that <br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it all with a grain of salt.
