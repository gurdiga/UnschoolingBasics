She raised me to find a husband who would <br/>\nsupport me and let me stay home with the kids.  She just doesn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand women who choose to work if they have the option of <br/>\nstaying home because all she&#39;s ever wanted to do is stay home.  But <br/>\nshe was never the type of involved parent I am.  She did her own <br/>\nthings, either watching television all day, or chatting with her <br/>\nfriends, the moms of my friends.  She&#39;s perfectly content if she has <br/>\na tv, cable box and a refrigerator.  That&#39;s not my style, though I <br/>\nlove being home with my children.  She&#39;s in awe that I am so <br/>\ninvolved in their lives but she worries I won&#39;t be able to let go <br/>\nwhen they are ready to &quot;leave the nest&quot;.  I hate that term.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFinding my interests is more overwhelming than curriculum decisions <br/>\nwhen I was doing strict school at home!  *lol*  The only passion <br/>\nI&#39;ve had since being a child was becoming a mom.  I&#39;d love to have <br/>\nmore children but my DH is done, done and done.  But no worries, I <br/>\nlook forward to being a grandmother.  But I&#39;ve been in baby-<br/>\nmaking/wanting mode for so long that I don&#39;t recall ever having any <br/>\nother desire.  My college days were kind of cool.  I loved being in <br/>\nclass.  But I was working toward a degree because I remember my <br/>\ndaddy telling me that if I wanted to be somebody, I needed to get a <br/>\ncollege degree.  He passed away 17 years ago and I am still playing <br/>\nthat record in my head even though I don&#39;t believe it from a logical <br/>\npoint of view.  I feel like the whole world is open before me and I <br/>\nonly need to take a step forward to begin, yet I hold back <br/>\nbecause ... I don&#39;t know why to be honest.  Nothing sounds <br/>\ninteresting enough but that sounds like an excuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy latest passion is beating Paper Mario The 1000 Year Door for <br/>\nNintendo Gamecube.

Unschool yourself.  Find your passions.  Indulge in<br/>\nyour passions.  Find that thing in life that brings you joy!  Look<br/>\nback at your life and ask yourself if you are doing the things that<br/>\nwere schooled to do.  Ask yourself if you are doing anything with all<br/>\nthe schooling that you took.  Look at all the things that you are<br/>\ndoing and ask if they are a result of schooling or passion.  I can&#39;t<br/>\ntell you the number of people I meet who have a degree in &quot;thus in<br/>\nsuch&quot; but they are working in a totally unrelated field.  They did<br/>\ntheir obligatory four years (or for some of us it was  more like 5 or<br/>\n6 LOL!) and got out and realized that they really didn&#39;t want to be an<br/>\naccountant, a history teacher, a biologist, a sociologist, an<br/>\nengineer, a school teacher, etc etc etc.  I knew a girl in college who<br/>\nwanted to study math.  She loved numbers.  She loved solving puzzles.<br/>\nHer parents pushed and pushed her to get a teaching degree because<br/>\n&quot;there is no money in mathematics.&quot;  She got her teaching degree,<br/>\nlasted 3 weeks in the classroom and promptly went back to college and<br/>\ntook all the math classes she could.  She didn&#39;t finish a &quot;degree<br/>\nprogram&quot; but she took math classes.  I lost track of her for a number<br/>\nof years but I ran into a mutual friend recently who hears from her<br/>\nregularly.  Guess what she does?  She&#39;s a mathematician with the<br/>\nFBI!!!!  If you have seen the show Numb3rs, that&#39;s the sort of work<br/>\nshe does.  She LOVES it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy co-parent is another prime example of someone who unschooled<br/>\nhimself.  He&#39;s a self-taught computer geek (and he finds that term a<br/>\ncompliment!)  He&#39;s doing that thing that he is passionate about.  He<br/>\nloves all the different aspects of computers and reads programming<br/>\nbooks and tech manuals like my kids read manga!  I&#39;ve watched his eyes<br/>\nlight up and get all excited when he learns a new way to manipulate a<br/>\nprogram or piece of hardware.  No degree and he says that he just<br/>\ncannot think of quitting his job because it is so multi-dimensional<br/>\nfinding another job that pays what this one does would be nearly<br/>\nimpossible.  Secretly I think he likes it because they let him have<br/>\nall the newest gadgets, toys, OSes, and he has 6 (or maybe it is 8)<br/>\ncomputer monitors in his office all hooked to 4 conjoined computers.<br/>\nYes; totally unschooled since he barely squeaked out of public school<br/>\nand living his passion!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244909672,"authorName":"freepsgal","from":"&quot;freepsgal&quot; &lt;freepsgal@...&gt;","profile":"freepsgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"When we mistakenly look for &#39;schoolish&#39; things...","postDate":"1150903689","msgId":14829,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU3Ym9pOSttMmU2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14830,"prevInTime":14828,"nextInTime":14830,"topicId":14829,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been thinking alot and discussing unschooling as a lifestyle with my husband.
