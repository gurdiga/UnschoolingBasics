It freaked me out <br/>\na bit. *I* translate it as &quot;feral.&quot; It brings up very negative gut <br/>\nreaction from me---but I *think* that was the point. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUn-schooled *can* seem very negative---in that &quot;well schooled&quot; is <br/>\nconsidered a good thing here. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut since my car is a rolling advertisement for unschooling, I get <br/>\nasked a LOT about it (one of the bumper stickers actually *says* &quot;Ask <br/>\nMe About Unschooling&quot;---so...you know...I&#39;m...ummmm... *asking* for it! <br/>\n&lt;BWG&gt;). And I like describing it---and after eight years of describing <br/>\nit, I&#39;m pretty good at it. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since it&#39;s been in the news a lot lately, it&#39;s important to *me* <br/>\nthat folks don&#39;t get the wrong idea about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t met anyone in these last five or six years who doesn&#39;t walk <br/>\naway at least a *little* more...ummmm....&quot;schooled&quot; about it. More <br/>\neducated. More informed. More knowledgeable. Wiser.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor *me*, it&#39;s important that I inform. I don&#39;t *want* all the <br/>\nmisinformation that swirls around unschooling. I d<br/>\non&#39;t want people <br/>\n*afraid* of it. In fact, I usually open with &quot;Yeah---we scare people.&quot; <br/>\nMost folks think they&#39;re too &quot;big&quot; to be scared, so they&#39;re <br/>\nautomatically more open to hear more about it cause they want to *show* <br/>\nme that they&#39;re tougher than that. That unschooling doesn&#39;t scare <br/>\n*them*! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin a short bit of time---they may not &quot;buy&quot; it, but they aren&#39;t as <br/>\nfearful either. And they&#39;ve met someone who is confidently <br/>\nunschooling---and proud of it. Even better is if one of the boys is <br/>\nwith me: I can show that they don&#39;t grow more three heads or anything. <br/>\nThey&#39;re not &quot;sheltered&quot; or &quot;stupid.&quot; They can hold conversations and <br/>\nlook you in the eyes. That&#39;s pretty impressive for some folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting here and at the other lists before GAVE me that confidence. At <br/>\nfirst, it&#39;s hard to do in person; but if you take the time to formulate <br/>\n*your* words in writing, over time, it starts flowing more easily when <br/>\nyou&#39;re speaking too. Reading was one thing. But writing online helped <br/>\nme *understand* unschooling better, so I could explain it better. <br/>\nLike----if I can make my fingers write the words, I must have a better <br/>\ngrasp of what I&#39;m thinking. That translates to the spoken word too. <br/>\nIt&#39;s easier to explain when it&#39;s solid in your head. Maybe it&#39;s just <br/>\nme---but I&#39;ve seen it happen again and again on these lists (Katherine <br/>\nis the most recent example! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s certainly not up to everyone to be a spok<br/>\nesman for unschooling! <br/>\n&lt;G&gt; But I&#39;m comfortable talking about it to strangers---and DO---a lot! <br/>\nAnd I want them aware that it IS an option---and a GOOD one. And to not <br/>\nbe afraid of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: &#39;Explaining unschooling&#39;","postDate":"1218486662","msgId":35340,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc3cTdpNythcGlsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUwNTAzMy42ODI0NS5xbUB3ZWI1NDEwNy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35335,"nextInTopic":35345,"prevInTime":35339,"nextInTime":35341,"topicId":35335,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... refrain from using the word unschooling .  He said the term gave him images of child neglect even though he knows it to be a positive way for children","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-279709029\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Vickisue Gray <br/>\n&lt;vickisue_gray@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; This post hit home for me as my doctor recently &#39;suggested&#39; I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>refrain from using the word &#39;unschooling&#39;.  He said the term gave him <br/>\nimages of child neglect even though he knows it to be a positive way <br/>\nfor children learn.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t use the term unschooling much outside the homeschooling <br/>\ncommunity most of the time.
