I&#39;ve had some delicious cookies in my time :) But <br/>\nsometimes I find myself compulsively going back for cookie after cookie.  I can <br/>\neat a lot of cookies!  And then I feel awful, physically.  Sometimes I find <br/>\nmyself eating cookies that don&#39;t even taste good to me.  Or, like last night, we <br/>\nhad a box of jelly beans and I was eating the flavors that nobody else would eat <br/>\nand I didn&#39;t like them either.  Passion Fruit: yuk!  Also, I don&#39;t really drink <br/>\nanymore because I used to do the same thing with beer.  I seem to be missing an <br/>\n&quot;off&quot; switch.  If there&#39;s food in front of me I will eat it until it&#39;s gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried various things and I&#39;ll keep working on it.  Reading unschooling <br/>\nlists is very good therapy! I&#39;ve made a lot of progress in the last few years of <br/>\nletting go of the emotional part of &quot;mistakes&quot;.  I don&#39;t feel shame for eating <br/>\nthose jelly beans, for example, I am just puzzled!  I said to my kids, &quot;these <br/>\npassion fruit jelly beans taste like smelly armpits to me, why am I eating <br/>\nthem???&quot;  and we all laughed and decided to find all the flavors we didn&#39;t like <br/>\nand throw them out.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling encouraged:  the fact that I posted something on a yahoogroup <br/>\nindicates that I&#39;m itching for a change.  Perhaps my period of low energy and <br/>\nmotivation has run it&#39;s course.  I think I will start some lists, as suggested, <br/>\nof things to do and things other people are doing.  I got a ukelele over the <br/>\nholidays but haven&#39;t been playing much because my poor fingers hurt.  Piano is <br/>\nmuch kinder on dry skinned fingers :)  We also are getting supplies for needle <br/>\nfelting, have been making finger puppets, making recipes and all the usual <br/>\ndriving the kids to their various activities.  So there&#39;s a lot of good <br/>\nhappening, too.  Maybe I also need to make a list of all the things we HAVE been <br/>\ndoing.  When I was getting comfortable with unschooling, when my kids were <br/>\nlittle, I would write down all the stuff we did.  It was reassuring, because <br/>\nit&#39;s so easy to notice all the things I&#39;m not doing and forgetting what we have <br/>\ndone.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Schuyler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:s.waynforth@...\">s.waynforth@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Fri, January 14, 2011 2:30:25 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: responsibility to our kids<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"s.waynforth@btinternet.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: responsibility to our kids","postDate":"1295001025","msgId":45814,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkzMTI4NS4xMTM4Ni5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDkyNDczLjMzMDA0LnFtQHdlYjEyMDYxMy5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDMzLkRCLjA3MDg3LjcwQjdGMkQ0QGNkcHRwYS1vbXRhbGIubWFpbC5yci5jb20+IDw5MjQ3My4zMzAwNC5xbUB3ZWIxMjA2MTMubWFpbC5uZTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45813,"nextInTopic":45815,"prevInTime":45813,"nextInTime":45815,"topicId":45808,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Cookies are good.

I like cookies and brownies and cakes and these little bars my <br/>\ngrandmother got the recipe for off the back of an can of Eagle Brand sweetened <br/>\ncondensed milk. Eating a lot of them can be fun too. I like dipping cookies in <br/>\nmilk or tea, and the cookie sludge at the bottom is an added boon. I had a <br/>\nreally good brownie last night when David, Linnaea and I got home from dancing. <br/>\nOh, that was good. I left half of it for David to take to work with him so that <br/>\nhe could have that serious pleasure in the middle of a not so seriously pleasant <br/>\nday. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour concerns about your habits becoming your children&#39;s habits suggest that you <br/>\nneed to look at your habits in a different light. For example, if I notice, and <br/>\nthis isn&#39;t something I&#39;ve seen for a long time, but if I noticed say Linnaea <br/>\ngoing and getting bag after bag of lunch box sized (the standard size for UK <br/>\nchips) cheese puffs I might ask if that was what she was hungry for or if it was <br/>\njust what was easy to access. Are you eating cookies because that&#39;s what you are <br/>\nhungry for or is it because it&#39;s what is easy to access? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just cancelled our satellite provider subscription. The money was better than <br/>\nthe service. We still have quite a few satellite channels, just not so many. The <br/>\ntelevision is almost never turned to any more. And I was the one who turned to <br/>\nit the most. But not having such easy access to okay programmes has changed my <br/>\nhabits. Instead I sit and play ukulele or watch a Hercules dvd with Simon or <br/>\nfelt a scarf for David or play Bananagrams with Linnaea or play fetch with the <br/>\ndog. It wasn&#39;t the television that kept me from doing any of those things. And I <br/>\ncertainly don&#39;t recommend that others get rid of their cable or satellite in the <br/>\nhope that they will be inspired to do different things. Downsizing our <br/>\ntelevision access was a long discussed decision and if any one of us wanted to <br/>\nresubscribe we&#39;d find the money to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as I don&#39;t recommend throwing out your television, I don&#39;t recommend <br/>\ngetting rid of cookies, just thinking about them before you eat. Are you eating <br/>\nthem as a passive response to hunger and boredom or are you eating them because <br/>\ncookies can be amazing and wonderful and glorious and good? Are you sitting at <br/>\nthe computer because it is what you want to do or because you can&#39;t really think <br/>\nof anything worth the greater effort it may take to do something more? Sometimes <br/>\nthat is an absolutely fine response, sometimes reaching for an easy option is a <br/>\ngood way of spending time, but maybe it isn&#39;t always the better option. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLists can help. I think I just wrote this. But lists of things to do can help. I <br/>\nhave lists on the fridge of things to do near us. Having a list of things to do <br/>\nat home could be a good reference for you. Things that you like to do, things <br/>\nyou want to try, things you&#39;d like to have to try. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it&#39;s hard to see a way out, the only way out of a kind of inertia is a <br/>\nsingle step forward at a time. Look for small changes you can make to your day, <br/>\nlook for different ways to embrace doing things with your kids, look for <br/>\ndifferent options for snacks, bake some things, make some things, go out for <br/>\ncookies somewhere. Do something a little different, look at things a little <br/>\ndifferent. Small steps, small changes will build to big differences. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: jennifer huck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danajeh@...\">danajeh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, 14 January, 2011 0:01:17<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: responsibility to our kids<br/>\n<br/>\nYes I think I am someone who got fully involved in my family (by choice, and I <br/>\nlove it!) and kind of forgot about myself.

Do you think your personality is no more than the sum of your impulses? <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the marvels of being human is we get to decide who we are - that&#39;s an idea that&#39;s at the root of unschooling, that we can create an environment that gives kids a wider ranges of choices for deciding who they are at any given moment. It applies just as well to adults - you can actively choose who you are from minute to minute, rather than running on autopilot. You can&#39;t always choose how to feel (although to a large extent you can do that, too) but you Can choose what to do about it - hunker down or forge ahead, look for ways to shift your thinking, or call a friend, or get out of the house so your mood isn&#39;t affecting the people around you so drastically. None of those involved &quot;pretending&quot; anything at all, they&#39;re different ways of dealing with a sour mood. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing, if your kids follow along with what you do, that they&#39;re pretty young. It&#39;s normal for kids to do a lot of that when they&#39;re little. They also likely have a lot of need for attention, connection, and socializing - also normal. So doing what you do is how they&#39;re learning about the world right now, and that includes both the positive and negative aspects of human behavior. Its intimidating to realize just how much of the world you&#39;re &quot;showing&quot; them!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;What if I go through a period of depression or burn out and am really struggling to get the minimum done,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>************<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that happening or is it a worry? If it&#39;s happening, call on whatever support network you have to come and do things with the kids, or take them out. If its a really serious issue, and you&#39;ve no-one to help you put them in school, that&#39;s what its there for. You don&#39;t have to be the limits of your child&#39;s world! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re just worrying, though, don&#39;t fret that a few off days now and then will somehow ruin your kids forever. Human nature has ups and downs, good moments and bad. How you handle those in the moment - the choices you make - is what&#39;s important. You get to choose to choose who to be. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":69128708,"authorName":"danajeh","from":"&quot;danajeh&quot; &lt;danajeh@...&gt;","profile":"danajeh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"responsibility to our kids","postDate":"1294943911","msgId":45808,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlnbmdyNytucnA3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":45809,"prevInTime":45807,"nextInTime":45809,"topicId":45808,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, There is something I ve been thinking about and would like to hear your thoughts.

If I go to bed at 9pm so do they.  If I stay up until 1am, so do they.  If I reach for cookies, they want cookies.  If I get busy with other things and don&#39;t have cookies, they also just get busy with other things and don&#39;t think about cookies. If I spend all day at the computer, they spend their day at the other computer or watching tv.  But if I stay away from the computer and keep busy with other things they magically do too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;ve just hit the big three: sleep, food and screen time ;-) but it seems to apply to everything in my house:  If I get inspired to do something arty, they follow right behind.  If I&#39;m in a crummy mood, they quickly catch it. If I get inspired to clean up the house, my kids join right in (really! :) <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a lot of responsibility! <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the very beginning it just didn&#39;t seem fair for me to inflict my own lifetime accumulation of habits upon these young people.  Or at least not the ones I consider &quot;bad&quot;, the ones that I&#39;ve struggled with about myself.  If I have some issues and tend to overeat (not in a joyful way, but in a &quot;I started with two cookies and now somehow the whole box is gone and I feel awful&quot;)  what do I do about my kids who are looking at me as a role model and copying everything I do?  What if I go through a period of depression or burn out and am really struggling to get the minimum done, and there is a lack of joy and inspiration in their lives that they seem to need me to provide or else they themselves don&#39;t have it?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy thinking goes like this:  I&#39;m human, I&#39;m not perfect!  And that&#39;s OKAY :-) But, when I&#39;m doing X it affects my kids negatively.  Oh no! I love my kids and don&#39;t want to be the one to inflict crummy stuff on them.  Wait -I could pretend!  I could *act* in a good way, even if it&#39;s not what I really feel like at that moment.  But then I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m being authentic. I feel like a hypocrite.  And manipulating! And I feel like we have missed an opportunity to learn something about being human, making mistakes, loving each other, etc.   <br/>\n<br/>\nTalk me down, people!!! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nJen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45783,"nextTopicId":45823}}
