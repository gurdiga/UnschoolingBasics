I think sometimes people tend to believe that the out loud reading proficiency in some way reflects the internal reading proficiency, so we can judge the one by observing the other.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sense is that when reading to oneself, the brain does a lot of interesting things in order to make the words make sense.  Internal reading isn&#39;t necessarily linear, so the brain can stop, turn back, revise in mid sentence, correct mistakes as new information comes along, drift off into images, re-read, whatever.  But when reading out loud, the reader is confined to a strict linearity, one word at a time and no opportunity to correct along the way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo when I listen to my 8 yr old son read out loud, what I hear is someone who isn&#39;t familiar enough with the structure of the sentence to anticipate what is likely to happen next.  He has to read each word flatly, because he cannot anticipate its relative importance in the sentence to know where to place emphasis.  Typically, he has to get almost to the end of the sentence before he can comprehend how all of the parts were supposed to fit together.  I can often practically hear the &quot;aha&quot; in his voice as the movement of the sentence itself suddenly makes sense.  So that&#39;s just a skill that requires a lot of time and practice, a lot of experience with words and sentences and texts before it comes naturally.  When he&#39;s reading something that he&#39;s familiar with, something that he&#39;s heard read out loud before, he&#39;s very fluent at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read out loud a lot and love reading out loud.  And one thing I&#39;ve found is that there&#39;s a tremendous difference between prose that can easily be read out loud and prose that can&#39;t.  And a great many things that read wonderfully in the mind are nearly impossible to read well out loud, simply because of the way the sentences unwind structurally.  I&#39;m a writer, too, and have a fascination with orality as a means of learning and knowing, and am actually trying to learn to write history and science books for children that are designed to be read out loud by parents.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry that went on so long!
