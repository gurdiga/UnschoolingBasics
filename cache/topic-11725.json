We do not<br/>\noften go the NE side of town but my husband says that the past few<br/>\ntimes he&#39;s seen them that that is what is done each time.  None of the<br/>\nwomen or children were dressed up although a couple of boys had on<br/>\nknight type gear, however, there were quiet a few men dressed up as<br/>\nknights.  Is that pretty much it for the Pensacola chapter? <br/>\n<br/>\n~Respectfully, Sandy<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW...I completely understand that this is a WONDERFUL organization<br/>\nand didn&#39;t take your comments Michelle, as a slam on the SCA,<br/>\nafterall, you said how great it was elsewhere.  Thank you for your<br/>\ninvite to seek more information, I&#39;ll let Zak know that that&#39;s pretty<br/>\nmuch it and see if he&#39;s still interested.  He hasn&#39;t spoken about it<br/>\nat all since Sunday, may have just been a fleeting thought.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11556,"nextTopicId":11698}}
