Florida has a little used<br/>\nhomeschool clause that allows parents to &quot;enroll&quot; their children in a<br/>\n&quot;private&quot; school (called 600 schools) which act as an umbrella.  Under<br/>\nthe umbrella school I use I only need to turn in our &quot;attendance&quot;<br/>\nevery year.  That&#39;s it.  I&#39;m not required to test nor to have my<br/>\nchildren&#39;s work evaluated each year.  The only downside that I have<br/>\nseen to this is that my children are not *technically* homeschooling -<br/>\nthey are registered at a private school (roll eyes!)  so they cannot<br/>\nparticipate in extracurricular activities (football or band) through<br/>\nthe school system nor take individual classes (say a language or arts<br/>\nclass).  This is total bogus because our being in a &quot;private school&quot;<br/>\ndoes nothing one way or another to impact the financial structure of<br/>\nthe county school system.  It&#39;s just a way of punishing the students<br/>\nwho have a particular interest because their parents chose to<br/>\nhomeschool them using an alternative form.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle - radically unschooling in NW Florida</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":274177100,"authorName":"Vickisue Gray","from":"Vickisue Gray &lt;vickisue_gray@...&gt;","profile":"vickisue_gray","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Florida unschooling was Unschooling in Idaho","postDate":"1160342851","msgId":17995,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYxMDA4MjEyNzMxLjgyNDg3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjU0MTA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMjcwMWM2ZWIxZiQxNDA1OGYyMCRmYzY4OTA0NUBkZWJvcmFoNzZhNzlodj4="},"prevInTopic":17993,"nextInTopic":18010,"prevInTime":17994,"nextInTime":17996,"topicId":17993,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks!
