And I do offer to do things<br/>\nwith him by asking him what he would like to do if anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your husband were up only 13 hours/day (let&#39;s say his job is <br/>\nmentally or physically exhausting---he needs that sleep) and he spent <br/>\nthree hours each day eating, chatting with you, and playing with the <br/>\ndog... He&#39;s *working* intently at his job for ten hours. (I&#39;ve had work <br/>\ndays that regularly lasted 12 hours, so I know this is possible.) He <br/>\nlikes his job. He&#39;s fulfilled. He gets to spend several hours each day <br/>\nwith his family. Would you be worried about *him*?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s wonderful to be able to focus that clearly on something <br/>\nyou&#39;re so passsionate about. I think it sounds OK.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet him know you think it&#39;s OK.
