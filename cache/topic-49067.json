There IS","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-289793036\">Jumping off of Meredith&#39;s reply-<br/>\nAnd if you do decide school would be worse... it&#39;s time to make a conscious effort to find the good that is there.  There IS good.  There is always good.  A child&#39;s smile.  30 seconds of quiet while you pee.  Make a gratitude practice into a mantra.  Look for the good.  Train yourself to see it.  Catch your kids doing awesome things and appreciate yourself for noticing.  Instead of becoming complacent when things are okay and freaking out when they aren&#39;t ( I think we all do this from time to time ) use the time when things are okay to increase your store of &quot;what&#39;s good&quot; examples, to dig in and connect MORE with your children so you know them that much better, and truly relish every drop of time and enjoyment you have that is just yours.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there is no shame in getting help.  If you can&#39;t afford to hire childcare help, public school makes fine daycare and the price is right.  Just do it on your own terms.  There are plenty of really responsive connected parents who put their kids in school.  Some are able to maintain that responsiveness and connection *because* they have that space.  24/7 responsive connected parenting isn&#39;t workable for everyone.  Frankly I&#39;d say a large number of those for whom it does work, aren&#39;t actually doing it 24/7 alone.  They have a tribe...whether it&#39;s a partner, friends, family....who help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThrowing one more thing out there....something I&#39;m seeing repeatedly among attachment parents/unschoolers is a tendency to make themselves responsible for their kids&#39; feelings.  Which means that if your kids aren&#39;t happy at every moment in the day, you blame yourself....&quot;if I were a better parent, they&#39;d be happy&quot;.  It&#39;s a lie.  And then it spirals out into something that looks like &quot;what else can I do?&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m trapped&quot; &quot;I hate this, I can&#39;t take it anymore&quot; and sometimes turns into &quot;this unschooling stuff (or ap stuff) is bullshit, it doesn&#39;t work&quot;.  When it&#39;s not unschooling at all that&#39;s not working.  It&#39;s the making yourself responsible for their feelings.  You are responsible TO them, not FOR them.  They WILL feel unhappy sometimes.  They WILL express it.  They WILL, if it&#39;s part of their innate personality, be loud about it, or lash out physically.   Sure, prevent it when you can....lists like this are full of great ideas for that...but there WILL be times when they aren&#39;t happy.  When there is conflict you need to have your resources in place to not take it personally, to be their resource, to help them....but it is not your job to MAKE it better.  It&#39;s your job to provide them with the support and resources to find better for themselves...to draw their own conclusions, try out their own solutions (which may or may not be ones you&#39;ve suggested)- to make space for them to try things their way....as long as that way is not harming anyone else.  <br/>\n<br/>\nComplaining is also a really easy habit to get into.  But it doesn&#39;t serve you.  It takes your energy away from what you *can* do to change the situation.  It sounds harsh, but it comes down to asking yourself &quot;what am I willing and able to do about it&quot;- even if the answer is that you&#39;re no longer willing or able to do it this way.  Then do what you have to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously though, you have a 3yo and 5yo.  That&#39;s life.  They&#39;re not polite.  They demand, often unpleasantly, that their needs be met.  They grow out of it.  (And they&#39;re also REALLY awesome at this age... look for that!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d edit this more....but my kids need food.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLesley <br/>\n<br/>\nEuphoria Life Design Studio<br/>\nJoin the Rest âˆž Play Project <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":66989399,"authorName":"Marieke Hensel","from":"Marieke Hensel &lt;marieke@...&gt;","profile":"mhvdgraaf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] I need some help.","postDate":"1348163068","msgId":49073,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRSt0bzdCaXd5MWdpZy1vQ1NSZ2h1SEpIbjM5MTlmMTl0MWNOTFJEQUxrc09lYXdod0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGszZmcyNytyMmJpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGszZmcyNytyMmJpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49071,"nextInTopic":49075,"prevInTime":49072,"nextInTime":49074,"topicId":49067,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is it possible to get some help?
