This past week, the kids and I met Gary at the Explora (kids&#39; museum) and both Andy and Gary explained to someone there that we unschool.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  A volunteer asked Andy where he goes to school, he said &quot;I don&#39;t go to school.&quot;  She said, &quot;Oh, so you homeschool?&quot;  He answered &quot;We unschool.&quot;  Moments later, I showed up (he&#39;d been exploring on his own) and she greeted me with &quot;so, you unschool?&quot;   I said yes, and when she asked I answered that unschooling is homeschooling without a curriculum, following our own interests.  Her only question was whether it was harder than schooling with a curriculum.  I said not really, but it is more fun!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Later, as I was telling Gary about the unschooling conversation with the volunteer, he related his own conversation with another volunteer where he told her we unschool.  Always before he starts out saying we homeschool, tho he often gets caught up in definitions of unschooling anyway, since folks always assume we school-at-home. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia  <br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nGet your email and more, right on the  new Yahoo.com <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":184269211,"authorName":"rebecca de","from":"rebecca de &lt;rebeccadehate@...&gt;","profile":"rebeccadehate","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] run-ins, and unschooling","postDate":"1158437696","msgId":17275,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwOTE2MjAxNDU2LjE2MzkyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjU2MTEyLm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUwMUI2QkE5LUM2QTktNDkxOS04RjhELTE3QzhCMTk5MjQwNUBjb3gubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":17268,"nextInTopic":17276,"prevInTime":17274,"nextInTime":17276,"topicId":17268,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Melissa, Don t be to hard on yourself!

Lesson learned -- I bet next time you&#39;ll stand a little taller and say something profound to the person.  For instance when you said the lady said there was no such thing as being unschooled -- then I suppose you could have said &quot;your right -- my children are always learning.&quot;   Geez, I am never to quick on things.  For instance I should have made the bus driver let me hug my child when he asked for last week when I tried sending him to headstart/preschool -- instead I let them dictate that he needed to just get on the bus because he would stop crying as soon as they drove away.... But I suppose if that incident hadn&#39;t of happened I wouldn&#39;t have been pushed quicker to say -- forget he&#39;s not going.....<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n         <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

The kids and I were at Home Depot buying a new light (of  <br/>\ncourse, can you say swirl? Then we looked at tiles, then tile  <br/>\ncleaners, then comparing products, then flooring samples, which the  <br/>\ngirls walked away with a few for ATC&#39;s, etc) Anyway, we ran into one  <br/>\nof the aide&#39;s from Emily&#39;s kindergarden class, gosh, maybe two years  <br/>\nago?<br/>\n<br/>\nShe asked how things were going, and when I mentioned how much fun we  <br/>\nwere having, she realized that the kids weren&#39;t in school anymore.  <br/>\n&quot;OH! So you&#39;re homeschooling?&quot; Josh pipes in really LOUDLY (his  <br/>\nnormal volumn) &quot;Yeah, we&#39;re unschoolers!&quot; She looks at him, and says  <br/>\nthat there is no such thing as unschooling, and that he shouldn&#39;t say  <br/>\nit because people will think he&#39;s ignorant. Oh man, one thing Josh  <br/>\ncannot tolerate is people thinking his ignorant, so the argument  <br/>\nstarts. Maybe two exchanges before I glance at him and make our  <br/>\nuniversal silence sign, and he quits (although I will say that he  <br/>\nmuttered one more &#39;I&#39;m too cool for school&#39; logo). I mention that we  <br/>\nneed to get home, and install the light before it gets dark, so we  <br/>\nscram.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were walking away, I told Josh that sometimes it&#39;s not about  <br/>\narguing, it&#39;s about recognizing that some people will not understand,  <br/>\nand a 60 year old teachers assistant is going to be one of those. And  <br/>\nwe talked about Sandra&#39;s example of where you live...and he totally  <br/>\nunderstood that and I am still kicking myself for being too much of a  <br/>\ncoward to stand up for my son and say that we ARE unschooling. Sigh.  <br/>\nNext time for sure.<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (9), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (5), Dan  <br/>\n(3), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17234,"nextTopicId":17284}}
