She enjoys when we run errands and would be in the car all the time to do so if she could LOL. She and my 5 year old share the third row seat in the van. I have a basket of toys in between their car seats filled with toys that we change out to keep it interesting. And movies are something they enjoy, actually the Lego Star wars movie LOL. My 2 year old also has a tray in the car where she can play with things like model magic or those little foam ball type things that stick together (the name which escapes me right now), none of which would stick on car interior. We attend church weekly and there she likes snacks and cutting playdough to keep her attention when she&#39;s not watching the band play. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the places you go, while there you can add a blanket for him to have with some toys to play on or even a play yard set up to let him have a place to himself for playing and napping. And he might enjoy you taking him outside so he can run and stretch his legs during their classes and playing things like tag or using a hippy hop. (I think that&#39;s what they are called : ). <br/>\nAs I think Sylvia mentioned, if he&#39;s really not happy with all the car time even with him having lots of things to switch between, try to find a way to make it so he can be home with you more. Maybe the other children can catch rides with some of the other parents, or another family member. Or possibly you could pay a Mother&#39;s helper who can drive and run your older kids back and fourth some of the days. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I never say no to them because I feel like I am helping them follow passions, but the balancing act is getting difficult so I am a bit lost.

But vacillating &quot;yes, no, yes, no, maybe, no, okay, no way...&quot; is worse because no one knows where anything stands. Each time a question/situation arises, stop and take a breath. Then another. Then maybe a third if you need to. Actually CONSIDER the situation or request - obviously, someone in the path of a speeding bus needs to be MOVED but there aren&#39;t a lot of those situations day to day really. You can even say &quot;give me a minute to think about that&quot; and then take a minute, think, then respond. Most of the time, we&#39;re conditioned to react rather than act and we think parents should have every answer on the spot. Sometimes it takes thinking because your childhood prompted response may not be in context with your children&#39;s lives. Give an answer then move forward, be willing to apologize and say &quot;sorry guys, I reacted badly there - I&#39;d like a do-over so I can think about it more before I answer&quot;, really LISTEN to what is being asked or said because all too often we THINK we know what someone is saying but often we&#39;ve shorthanded it &quot;this sounds like those other 6 things so NO&quot; when they may have reconsidered and come up with an altered plan that is just fine but sounds similar. If it helps, stop and think &quot;How would I have wanted my mom to act in this situation when I was this age?&quot; A lot of times, the &#39;wild child&#39; is looking to get attention - any attention even bad is better than no attention at all.

Sometimes it is hard to remember that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have gradually come to unschooling because my children have so many interests outside the home I just felt like being home to do school work was a waste of time. I think I just need to focus on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again everyone.

And do the Mom&quot;s or the two year old&#39;s feeling count<br/>\nfor anything?  Sure it is important that the kids are happy but they are<br/>\nstill part of a larger group of people.  My daughter who is nearly 8 really<br/>\nwould like to be out going and doing and seeing people.  My son who is<br/>\nnearly 6 would prefer to be home and does not do well in big groups at all.<br/>\n We have to balance these competing desires.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would take the two year old&#39;s feelings into consideration.  If he does<br/>\nnot like being in the car maybe try to consolidate the lessons and meetings<br/>\nto 3 days a week and maybe try to have people over to play on one or two of<br/>\nthe other days.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if the Mom is feeling like she is never home that should be taken into<br/>\nconsideration too.  Here in the US a lot of activities (even homeschool<br/>\nactivities -weird right?) are winding down for the summer. Maybe some of<br/>\nthe things the kids are involved in are drawing to a natural conclusion and<br/>\nyou can spend the summer months with a more relaxed schedule.  After<br/>\nseveral weeks of a more relaxed schedule everyone might be ready to gear up<br/>\nagain in September or maybe they might be more open to having more days at<br/>\nhome.  Also as the two year old gets bigger you will get a better sense of<br/>\nwhat his interests are.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New with schedule questions","postDate":"1336487078","msgId":48496,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzY0ODcwNzguODM4MzYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA4Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpvODl1OStvbDZuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpvODl1OStvbDZuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48494,"nextInTopic":48497,"prevInTime":48495,"nextInTime":48497,"topicId":48494,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Are the kids unhappy with the schedule?

I just feel that my children are amazing and wonderful and they deserve a life that is as equally as wonderful and amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have LOTS of questions on how to transition my family but my biggest one is the children&#39;s schedules.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DD is 9yo. and loves to dance. We are there 4-5x&#39;s a week. I takes up a lot of our time and sometimes she gets a bit tired of it, but when asked if she would like to cut back or try something new she is devastated that we even ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DS is 12yo. and is involved with drama, DI, katare, nature classes and any other small activities he thinks willbe fun. We are constantly driving him here and there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I have a very energetic DS who is 2yo. The poor thing is carted around all the time. We have started leaving the kids at some of their classes so he doesn&#39;t have to stay but he often gets stuck at boring classes and driving around. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also feel that with all this running around we are lacking in down time to explore things together or just have fun as a family. When we are home the kids just plop on the couch because they are exausted. We also belong to an all day co-op on Monday&#39;s which they (all 3)LOVE but it is just more time away from home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never say no to them because I feel like I am helping them follow passions, but the balancing act is getting difficult so I am a bit lost. We are really only home 2days a week :(<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp<br/>\nMiriam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48504,"nextTopicId":48525}}
