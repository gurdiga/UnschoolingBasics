Children don&#39;t see<br/>\nright and wrong so much as the need or wish for something.  Right/wrong is<br/>\nculturally induced thinking.  It can be useful but with children it helps to<br/>\ntake each individual instance and (this is why unschooling is so great) find<br/>\nsome way for what they want to happen at least to some degree.  Right/wrong<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help much until after certain stages of development occur.  Children<br/>\nmay &quot;seem&quot; to understand the concepts because they can say the words &quot;right&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no.&quot;  At first, children see the world as full of<br/>\npossibilities.  They tend to ignore obstacles and plunge in.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually children begin to experience some options as better than<br/>\nothers... as in, such and such works better for what we&#39;re trying to do in<br/>\nsome situation, but in some other situation, another option might work<br/>\nbest.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a learning process for all of us.  Maybe one of the greatest things<br/>\nthat happens to people is to have children who wake them back up to the<br/>\nworld of wonder and possibilities, which many of us have long forgotten.<br/>\nRight and wrong are not the only important options that work well.  There&#39;s<br/>\na whole lot more to it than than and having only right/wrong to choose from<br/>\nis a very limited set of options.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if we were to see everything as a range of available options, a<br/>\nspectrum if you will, that yields infinite degrees of &quot;gray&quot; and other<br/>\n&quot;colors&quot; ...not just the &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; of right/wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 6/30/08, swissarmy_wife &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heatherbean@...\">heatherbean@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Did anyone read Scott Noelle&#39;s Daily Groove this morning?
