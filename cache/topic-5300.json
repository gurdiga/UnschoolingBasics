Or the eggs or the potatoes or whatever - <br/>\nwho cares? Kids at home will get the chance to use a spoon. Guaranteed. <br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to set up a &quot;learning center&quot; for this. And mom can be <br/>\nthere to help clean up - to give him/her a bigger spoon if he/she needs <br/>\nit. And the kid will spoon his/her own stuff IF and WHEN he/she wants <br/>\nto do it and NOBODY else except the child knows when the right time is <br/>\nfor him/her to spoon things - when the challenge will be fun and <br/>\nsatisfying and beneficial versus too-difficult and frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if you happen to eat Chinese food and you get some <br/>\nchopsticks and your kid seems interested in using them - you might put <br/>\nsome cotton balls in a bowl and let him/her try to move them to another <br/>\nbowl with the chopsticks.

If you son seems wistfully wishing for more play <br/>\ntime with other kids, do something to make that happen. Go to <br/>\nhomeschool groups - they have younger kids, too, you know. You can go <br/>\nto more than one group. START a group. Get out a calendar JUST for play <br/>\ndates and make the effort to schedule them and write them down so he <br/>\nknows they are coming up.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And you can eventually stop worrying and thinking about what he&#39;s <br/>\nlearning - because you&#39;ll just know that he&#39;s learning all the time - <br/>\nbut just for this time maybe it&#39;ll help you to realize that by using a <br/>\ncalendar to keep track of play dates - something important to him - <br/>\nhe&#39;ll be learning all the calendar &quot;lessons&quot; that are commonly &quot;taught&quot; <br/>\nin kindergarden and 1st grade and 2nd grade. This is the kind of thing <br/>\nthat &quot;just happens&quot; when parents are supporting kids&#39; interests. <br/>\nLearning happens.

We are in Florida by<br/>\n  the way, so I have been checking into the &#39;laws&#39; of unschooling. It<br/>\n  seems to me that Florida is pretty relaxed, am I right?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ok, our story is this.... we have 2 children, Ethan just turned 4 and<br/>\n  his sister is 18 months. I&#39;ve been a SAHM since Ethan was born. I&#39;m a<br/>\n  very hands-on mommy, the kids are always with me and we spend lots of<br/>\n  time together. We are Attachment Parents and practice Gentle<br/>\n  Discipline.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Ethan is extremely smart, he learns very quickly and asks lots of<br/>\n  questions. I guess you can say we&#39;ve always unschooled, he&#39;s learned<br/>\n  so much through everyday life. He&#39;s never been away from me, meaning<br/>\n  he&#39;s never been in any sort of school setting and has never shown any<br/>\n  interest in going. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I do feel guilty at times when Ethan&#39;s begging for kids to play with<br/>\n  (such as the neighborhood kids) and they are all at school. But then<br/>\n  again, he never says he wants to go to school, too. I have asked him<br/>\n  if he&#39;d like to go to school and he says &quot;No, I want to be home with<br/>\n  you, Mommy&quot; which makes me very happy! But he doesn&#39;t know what school<br/>\n  is and has nothing to compare being home to. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve always, always planned on keeping the kids home and<br/>\n  unschooling/homeschooling them. My husband and I both had awful school<br/>\n  experiences and hated school! I cried through K and some of 1st grade,<br/>\n  and I do believe that made me despise school somewhat! I just wasn&#39;t<br/>\n  ready and wanted to be at home with my mother so bad. And even later<br/>\n  on in school when I was considered &quot;popular&quot; I<br/>\n  hated going and would&#39;ve chosen to stay home if given the chance. I<br/>\n  ended up quitting school in the 10th grade and getting my GED.<br/>\n  Ironically, my husband has a similar experience in school that ended<br/>\n  the same way. <br/>\n<br/>\n  So, having said all that, I do worry that I(WE) don&#39;t have enough<br/>\n  education to teach/help our kids through their school years. Do any of<br/>\n  you worry about this? <br/>\n<br/>\n  And to top it off, there&#39;s a great Charter school opening near us for<br/>\n  K-8. It&#39;s basically the result of our Montessori/Waldorf schools only<br/>\n  going to 1st grade. It sounds like a great opportunity and now has me<br/>\n  questioning my decision to keep Ethan home. NOT because I want him to<br/>\n  go off to school (the thought gives me a panic attack) BUT I don&#39;t<br/>\n  want to sell him short either and this school will be offering The<br/>\n  arts (music, movement, physical arts(pottery, drawing, etc) Waldorf<br/>\n  handworking and rhythm, Montessori self-directed, self-correcting<br/>\n  materials, and unschooling techniques of letting kids learn through<br/>\n  everyday life with Multi-age groups so kids can feel comfortable<br/>\n  working above or below their grade level.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Since it&#39;s a charter school, it&#39;s considered public (free) but very<br/>\n  parent-led. It&#39;s probably going to be very hard to get accepted into<br/>\n  this school since spots are limited. I&#39;m just not sure if I should try<br/>\n  or not. I would never leave Ethan at school (or anywhere) that he<br/>\n  didn&#39;t want to be. But he enjoys other children so much that I wonder<br/>\n  if he&#39;d enjoy it?<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you had a chance at what sounded like a great school, do you think<br/>\n  it&#39;s woth it or is it always better to homeschool/unschool?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Any advice for me?  I just want to do the right thing and I realy<br/>\n  stress out about the &quot;school&quot; issue!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n  Tricia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

But I also don&#39;t believe school is  inherently evil <br/>\nor wrong for every family.  That said, I have very simple  advice for you.  <br/>\nYour son doesn&#39;t want to go to school and you don&#39;t want  to send him.  Don&#39;t!!!!<br/>\n <br/>\nYou&#39;re worried that you&#39;re not smart enough to help your bright child  learn. <br/>\nThink about this: are the most important things you&#39;ve learned in life  <br/>\nthings you learned in a classroom setting? I bet not! You learned about  parenting, <br/>\nfunctioning as an adult, and probably many other things. You&#39;ve read,  you&#39;ve <br/>\ntalked to people, explored. You had enough curiosity about parenting, for  <br/>\nexample, to discover approaches your mom had never heard of!<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd you and and your husband are not going to be the only people who help  <br/>\nyour son learn. There&#39;s a whole world out there you can explore together. You  <br/>\ncan help him find his passions and nurture them and help him find resources. If <br/>\n he discovers a passion for nuclear physics at age 8, you&#39;ll find people who <br/>\nare  thrilled to share their love for nuclear physics with so young a child.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou&#39;ll find people of all ages, not just age-peers, who will become Ethan&#39;s  <br/>\nfriends. Ultimately that matters more than becoming friends with someone just  <br/>\nbecause they sit next to each other in school and are both exactly six years  <br/>\nold.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou can do this. We&#39;ll help!<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n <br/>\n***********************<br/>\nIn a message dated 3/26/2005 10:05:52 AM Eastern Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nHi  folks,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m new to the group and would like some advice.
