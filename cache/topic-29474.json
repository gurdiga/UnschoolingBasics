If it&#39;s carried by the military pharmacy, it&#39;s free. There is almost always more than one type of med for any given ailment, if not generic than maybe a different drug that treats the same thing. The doc may be able to find a more affordable option if you explain the situation. There&#39;s the mail order, where you have to pay but it&#39;s something like $3.00 for a 3 month supply for the same thing that would cost $3.00 at a civilian pharmacy. The price goes up a bit depending on where the drug is on the list, formulary and what not. I can never remember what all those terms are. Then there&#39;s using a civilian pharmacy, which is the most expensive.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Maybe it depends on which type of insurance you have. I use Standard rather than Prime so I have to pay for everything (unless I use the military services) but everything is covered. If you have Prime and a med is not on the Prime list, maybe you have to pay for the entire thing out of pocket?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Alysia<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
