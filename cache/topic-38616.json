I can tell you how we live as unschoolers, how my children are doing,<br/>\netc., but that doesn&#39;t really mean a thing until you do it. Because unschooling isn&#39;t a &quot;system&quot; or a &quot;plan&quot; with definite goals and measures along the way. It is an individual process.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you aren&#39;t willing to take a chance on a life that people can talk to you about but never really promise you much about, if you need an FAQ to unschooling with definite answers about most things, then no amount of reading about unschooling will satisfy.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to sound too mystical because that surely isn&#39;t my way, :) but it does take a certain leap of faith to try something as amorphous as unschooling must sound to almost every newbie. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope the original poster is up for the adventure but I would completely understand if she is not -- very little about unschooling is definite. If you need those definite answers and lots of resources giving the same definite answers, it may not be for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38609,"nextTopicId":38622}}
