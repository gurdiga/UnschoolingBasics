He was a literal kind of guy. &lt;g&gt; So, as a good wife (but <br/>\nagainst my better judgment), I started buying and using margarine <br/>\n(ugh!). For 12 years!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he got a job as a sales rep for a restaurant food distributor. At <br/>\na seminar (probably sponsored by the dairy industry! &lt;g&gt;), he was told <br/>\nthat margarine was one hydrogen atom away from plastic. Overnight we <br/>\nwere back to BUTTER! I did a happy dance! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;d like to know whether anyone else has dealt with this, or a<br/>\nsimilar food (condiment) issue, and how you handled it.

It says, what if he eats it and wants another, and<br/>\nanother, and another. Is it OK to let them eat butter or drink salad<br/>\ndressing until they have had their fill? Or would I somehow be<br/>\nnegligent to support this desire. Please help.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think Ben would appreciate my keeping these things from him. I <br/>\nasked him whether he&#39;d always done that. He said yes. I asked what his <br/>\nmom said to it. He said he never did it in front of her---and he never <br/>\ngot caught! &lt;g&gt; He also added that he used to drink A-1 sauce from the <br/>\nbottle, but now it&#39;s too expensive. But he *will* drink BBQ sauce, soy <br/>\nsauce---basically any condiment. I&#39;ll have to start watching him at the <br/>\nfrig!
