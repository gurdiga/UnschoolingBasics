Then with the &quot;help&quot; of my friends-LOL- decided that there was absolutley no way unschooling would work for us. This time I decided that it will and with my hubby&#39;s blessing we are commited to a year of trial. For the sake of family we are saying that we will reevaluate at the end of 2008. BUT since I evaluate my life at the end of every year it was an easy statement to make.<br/>\nI have been lurking here for a week or so and the posts in answer to Karen&#39;s questions have really been a blessing to me. She has asked questions that i was afraid to articulate in my own mind! <br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking forward to chatting with you all and gleaning from you. Any words of wisdom on adapting to this lifestyle are appreciated and welcomed.<br/>\nMy children still at home are ranging from fifteen down to almost three.
