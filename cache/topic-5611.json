I <br/>\nam under<br/>\nthe impression that we will have to be keeping track of what looks <br/>\nlike, at<br/>\nleast, credit hours.  And that if the girls want to attend college, <br/>\nthey will<br/>\nhave to have those, and at least some textbooks listed in their <br/>\ntranscripts that<br/>\nthe college applications office recognizes (I have spoken to University <br/>\nof MD so<br/>\nfar.)  Is it just more work on the parents&#39; part to make what the <br/>\nchildren do<br/>\n&quot;look&quot; like school?<br/>\n<br/>\nOur state requires two reviews a year--where portfolios are examined.  <br/>\nI belong<br/>\nto an Umbrella group, however, which only reviews me once a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust looking for ideas on what unschoolers&#39; portfolios look like for<br/>\npresentation purposes and how unschoolers pull together transcripts for <br/>\ncollege.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNot avoiding you---just slammed.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst---each college is different. I&#39;d look around a bit for one that <br/>\nis more unschooling friendly---there are a lot of them. Unfortunately, <br/>\nstate schools tend to be the least accomodating---they&#39;re just so far <br/>\nbehind the more progressive private schools! Most of the smaller <br/>\nschools are going after unschoolers and don&#39;t require what they do of <br/>\ntraditionally schooled kids---the transcripts and grades and such. Real <br/>\nlife experiences and portfolios are MORE than acceptable---plus, the <br/>\nunschooled kids stand out as &quot;diverse&quot; &lt;G&gt;!<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it&#39;s more work for the parents. The schools take on that role when <br/>\nyou hand your children over to them, so now that you are the &quot;head of <br/>\nthe school,&quot; you&#39;ll have to take on that duty too! &lt;g&gt; I&#39;d say that <br/>\nit&#39;s not necessary to make it look like school as it is to make it look <br/>\ninteresting and different---DIVERSE! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 17 year old is a drummer and is very intersted in music.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *could* label that as just &quot;Music&quot;---but it&#39;s so much more than that: <br/>\nhe&#39;s really into the music of the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s, so he gets credit for:<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory/Geography/Social Studies: travel  to different parts of the <br/>\ncountry to attend music festivals and meet folks from all over; civil <br/>\nrights; Viet Nam war;  presidencies of Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, & <br/>\nCarter;  British invasion<br/>\n<br/>\nArt: music, fashion, album covers, Warhol, posters (art is not even <br/>\nrequired in my state of SC)<br/>\n<br/>\nMath: half notes, 3/4 notes, etc. all that music is just math in sound<br/>\n<br/>\nScience: drug culture (chemistry & biology--grandfather is a Dr and <br/>\nworked in Haight-Asbury in the late 60&#39;s---lots of stories to tell <br/>\nabout al that!&lt;g&gt;), drumming (physics), tie-dye (chemistry!)<br/>\n<br/>\nLiterature & Composition: lyrics (reading other & writing his own)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has a busy life *other* than music as well, so that&#39;s not where all <br/>\nhis learning takes place, but that&#39;s what I get *just* out of <br/>\nmusic!---and that&#39;s not any where complete---just a sampling for right <br/>\nnow for you!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t break our lives into subjects---that antithetical to <br/>\nunschooling! But when you have to report to the state in any way, it <br/>\nhelps to be able to break it down that way!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for transcripts: I would just break what he&#39;s done into semester <br/>\nblocks (which is what the local high schools do here) and figure out <br/>\nhow much time he&#39;s spent doing something. He would probably have *many* <br/>\nmore than the required number of credits than any local high school <br/>\nstudent!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you need to take a deep breath and think hard about what your <br/>\nchildren have covered over a few months.

Why are you doing this stuff?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nYour description here sounds like Unschooling to me.

I would like to take it further with the idea that your<br/>\nkids are also like the water itself - carving out the path of the stream -<br/>\nnot just following someone else&#39;s pre-made path.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Trust behind them... I am understanding this statement to mean that <br/>\nI am trusting they are learning what they need to learn, not what I <br/>\nthink they need to learn. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is what I understand it to mean also - along with Trusting them to know<br/>\nthe *way* they wish to learn something as well as the *what*.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

SOOO here I go.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nClearly you lead a full and interesting life. However really only you can<br/>\nanswer whether you are Unschooling. I can suggest some ideas to think about,<br/>\nsince you were asking the question.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list of (fabulous) activities, taken alone, could easily apply to<br/>\nsomeone schooling-at-home or using unit studies or being an eclectic<br/>\nhomeschooler, or even someone at school whose parents are really committed<br/>\nto extra-curricular activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of Unschooling is not the activities (which all sound absolutely<br/>\nwonderful) but the how they are chosen and the why and the Trust behind<br/>\nthem. The point is the how the parents and children are interacting. These<br/>\nare issues you could think about if you wanted another way to *describe*<br/>\nyour life to others in Unschooling terms, rather than only as a catalog of<br/>\nhow you spend your time (which is also very interesting, and useful to<br/>\npeople who might be wondering if our lives can be rich and full).<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling kids formulate their own goals, and engage in activities for<br/>\nreasons of their own, rather than because some external person, such as Mom,<br/>\nhas some kind of educational *or* life lessons agenda. They generate their<br/>\nown criteria for success.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling kids are free to stop doing anything that they have lost<br/>\ninterest in at any time, even if it has been fun in the past, without being<br/>\npressured by an external source to continue.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of the activities the family is undertaking, the parents Trust<br/>\nthat their children are getting something meaningful *to them* out of any<br/>\nthat they choose to pursue. Parents don&#39;t set arbitrary time limits, or<br/>\nquiz, or check up that some milestone or goal has been reached.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling children have privacy of thought - they are not required to<br/>\nreport what they have learned, even if they could quantify it which seems<br/>\nunlikely, and they are not required to share or publicize their writings or<br/>\nart works - unless they choose to.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling families tend to handle conflict resolution without making one<br/>\nperson&#39;s needs subservient, or without reference to any judgment that one<br/>\nperson&#39;s desires are more worthy or educational than another&#39;s. Playing<br/>\nvideo games is not considered more or less valuable than exploring through<br/>\nthe microscope.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling families tend to see all of their activities and pursuits as<br/>\ninterconnected and forming connections, as part of a greater concept of<br/>\nunderstanding how the world works and out place in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this just touches on the Un*school*ing part, not the rest of the Whole<br/>\nLife Unschooling - the other life issues like Bedtimes, Food, Chores,<br/>\nPersonal Hygiene.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am enjoying my family, we are learning together, loving together <br/>\nand living together.

We look at things under the microscope <br/>\nwe have tried to cross pollenate flowers, we make all kinds of huge <br/>\nmesses with gooey science type stuff and alike. We play games <br/>\nindoors and out, we run throught the sprinklers, do slip and slide <br/>\nand have water balloon fights. We visit with neighbors, DD helps a <br/>\nneighbor with her kids, we play guitar and piano. We listen to <br/>\nmusic, make up silly stories, we lay in bed and laugh. We love one <br/>\nanother. DD runs track and is the SC state champ in shotput(as of <br/>\ntoday!!) she also plays soccer and I have had a hard time with the <br/>\norganized sports, but she loves it sooo I honor that. We take care <br/>\nof our pets, a bird, a turtle and 2 guenie pigs (one just died) we <br/>\nlearn about life, death and god. We play with friends, go to the <br/>\nmovies and watch TV.

We bird watch, spider watch etc...We go out on <br/>\nour boat and see all kinds of fun stuff like, <br/>\ncrabs,fish,jellyfish,dolphins,seagulls,pelicans and we play at the <br/>\nbeach. We dig holes at the beach, we make sandcastles, we boogie <br/>\nboard on the waves. We google everything!!!
