Young teens often need a good bit of privacy. If he&#39;s been needing that, having to share a room could be grating on his nerves in a big way!<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk it over with the 11yo first, maybe, so you can let him know you&#39;re looking for ways to ease the tension with his brother, and think it might help if the 14yo has more privacy. If you talk to him first, you have the chance to frame that all gently so it doesn&#39;t come across as &quot;your brother doesn&#39;t like you&quot;. But also ask the 14yo if this is something he wants - does he want his own room or would he rather have one of the younger kids move in with him?

And an eldest child can feel very crowded out - any child in a big family, but the eldest has had the experience of being an only child, even if for only a few years. Do you tend to ask/expect him to help with his siblings? It might help a Lot to step back from that. If asked for his help a lot in the past, he might not realize he can say &quot;I don&#39;t want to take care of the littles&quot; - it could help to outright tell him. When Ray first came back to us, at 13, he had been expected to help with his mom&#39;s second child, who&#39;s just a little younger than Morgan. He didn&#39;t realize he wasn&#39;t expected to do all the same things at our house - didn&#39;t realize if I left the room he wasn&#39;t &quot;in charge&quot;. It helped him to come right out and tell him he didn&#39;t have to do that any more. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237699340,"authorName":"messy_boys","from":"&quot;messy_boys&quot; &lt;messy_boys@...&gt;","profile":"messy_boys","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"My 14 year old","postDate":"1341502193","msgId":48721,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp0NGJ0aCtmcTZuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48722,"prevInTime":48720,"nextInTime":48722,"topicId":48721,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would appreciate your input and ideas on my 14yo.

He seems tired and stressed and has for a while.  Things improved when I started moving towards an unschooling life.  We dropped formal studies.  He absolutely hated schoolwork of any kind.  I relaxed my time limits on his TV and video games.  I also have relaxed my &#39;control&#39; on his day, such as telling him when to go to bed, when to eat, etc...  He is very happy about all these changes and in many ways our relationship is better than ever! <br/>\n<br/>\nBut - he is very impatient with his siblings, who are all younger than him.  My 11 yo in particular is a regular target of his anger.  If the computer crashes, it&#39;s D&#39;s fault.  If a cup spills, it&#39;s D&#39;s fault.  He huffs and puffs whenever D needs help with something.  D is a quiet, sensitive type and I know this hurts him.  (I do try to be proactive and intervene as much as possible before these things happen.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, they share a room...and I am wondering if I should change this and give B (my 14 yo) his own room.  ???  I could set D up with his younger brothers (who look up to him).  Is this a good idea?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, any other ideas on helping my 14 yo with his emotions?  We have a very open relationship, but I get the feeling that he mostly just wants to be left alone, so I honor that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKristie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48708,"nextTopicId":48673}}
