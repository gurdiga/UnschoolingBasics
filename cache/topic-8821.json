You will notice that issues come up cyclically. <br/>\n<br/>\nWithout intending to discourage you from reading all that you want, you<br/>\ncould save yourself some time by going to www.sandradodd.com/unschooling for<br/>\na lot of writings by many of the posters handily organized into topics (as<br/>\nthe boards are, but more distilled.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon you will come to the realization that the &quot;fear of teaching&quot; will<br/>\nbecome irrelevant since Unschooling is not about &quot;teaching&quot; at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is about Trusting, facilitating, relationships and connections.

I am so happy to have found ya&#39;ll!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a brief introduction, I am from Michigan, found the man of my <br/>\ndreams the second time around, and we are raising our 3 children.  <br/>\nMy dd was homeschooled until the age of 7.  She attended 2nd grade <br/>\nin public school last year, and is in the middle of 3rd grade this <br/>\nyear.  My oldest ds is in public school half-day kindergarten, while <br/>\nmy youngest ds is 6 months old TODAY and doing just fine with <br/>\nhomeschooling, thankyou very much!  :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor various good reasons, I put my children into public school, but <br/>\nnow I am questioning that choice.  One of the big reasons being the <br/>\nfight over education with my ex, who was concerned that the two <br/>\noldest were lagging behind, learning nothing.  I will have to <br/>\novercome this hurdle first before returning them home, but dh and I <br/>\ndefinitely do not want the baby in the public school system.  It&#39;s <br/>\nNICE to be agreed on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I had heard about John Holt back when I was homeschooling my <br/>\ndaughter, but it seemed too &quot;scary&quot;.  But recently, I came across <br/>\nunschooling again when I learned that my dear friend, a long-time <br/>\nhomeschooler from my church, had unschooled ALL her children (her <br/>\ntwo oldest sons are electrical engineers.)  It was like a lightbulb <br/>\nwent off in my head, saying, &quot;THIS is it!  And YOU can do it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m here, to sit at your feet and unlearn the fear of teaching my <br/>\nown at home.
