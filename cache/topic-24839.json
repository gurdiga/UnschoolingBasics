Well, instead of taking that as a cue that she has a fear of some kind, I plop my infant son in her lap and tell her that&#39;s the best way to get over it! Ha! How very sensitive of me! The good new is, she now spends her days here doing nothing BUT holding the baby (voluntarily:). <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I am terribly shy in social situations, but would like to describe it as &#39;overstimulated&#39;. I can&#39;t handle much noise, much interaction with more than 2 people...I shut down. You&#39;ll either see this glazed look in my eye, or sheer panic. I spend a lot of time in the bathroom at social events (even family events), decompressing and trying to center myself. I&#39;ve gotten better at it over the years, thanks to meditation, but I still fear groups of chatty people.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I watch my son respond to groups as if he&#39;s overstimulated, too. Alone, or with 1-2 kids, he&#39;s charming, thoughtful, gentle and considerate. But as soon as the number of kids increases, he&#39;s like a spinning top. He doesn&#39;t listen (to me or them), won&#39;t stop annoying games, even when asked by the kids...just goes into a mania, of sorts. When my nieces came to spend a week for Spring Break I was able to observe his behavior in full force for a week solid. I thought he would slow down, or atleast pace himself after a few days, but nope. From the moment he awoke to the time he crashed at night, he was someone else&#39;s rambunctious kid. The day I took the girls to thier Nana&#39;s house and kept him to take back home with me, the second he was buckled in the carseat to drive away, he was his old self again.He was even able to express his need to &#39;be alone&#39; some, too. <br/>\n  .:*:Lisa:*:.   <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nMeredith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meredith@...\">meredith@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sylvia Toyama <br/>\n&lt;sylgt04@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As a child, I found refuge in the word shy -- once people heard <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that I was shy, they pretty much left me to myself, especially when <br/>\nmy younger sister became &#39;the outgoing one&#39; in our home. <br/>\n***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nWow, that would have been so nice....

I try to remind dh that both he and I were very much the same as DS as <br/>\nchildren!<br/>\n<br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  As a once-shy child (and really at heart, a shy adult) and Mom of two shy children, I can sympathize. IMO, putting (forcing) a child into social situations, things like organized sports, etc in the hopes it will break him out of his shell, is never a good idea.  I remember how terribly painful it was to be thrust in a situation where I had to speak to others, or worse yet, be on the spot to hit the ball, call out the answer, or be the center of anyone&#39;s attention.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Memories of my experiences as a shy child, led me to be very accommodating of my firstborn&#39;s shyness.  He needed to feel confident in a room to know how he fit in.  I could see and understand that.  Once he&#39;s figured out what the room/group expects from him, and how he can meet that situation, he jumps right in and shines.  It just takes more time -- and safety -- than most people want to give to a child.  Forcing him to be in a situation where he had to jump right in, only pushed him farther into himself -- because he didn&#39;t feel safe, and the adults who force him aren&#39;t being trustworthy.  I&#39;ve always felt it&#39;s part of the perfectionist&#39;s package, too -- being shy is the ultimate protection from being found in some way deficient by others.  It&#39;s a protection, to keep you safe until it&#39;s okay to let other people in.  Let him have his safety net.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBoardwalk for $500? In 2007?

I was told by someone that it is a natural stage at this age, and to be expected. Even without durastic change going on at home, children of this age go through separation anxiety. I was also reassured that they outgrow it, as I am waiting for, myself.<br/>\n   When my son was 2 he was such a social butterfly that I put him in MDO twice a week just to give him consistent playtime with others. He continued that until he reached 4yrs, then asked to stop MDO. He wants nothing more than to hang out with Mom and play with friends at home, so I oblige him. <br/>\n   I wish you well, and hope BOTH our kids outgrow this stage fairly soon. Until then, I will just keep him next to me until he&#39;s ready to venture out and explore on his own.
