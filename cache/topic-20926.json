All the  <br/>\nlessons in the world aren&#39;t going to overcome genetics. And for those  <br/>\nwho are hardwired to spell well, all they need do is absorb spelling  <br/>\nfrom the world around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think automatic spell checkers are a boon to spelling :-) I&#39;m a  <br/>\ndecent speller but seeing words I&#39;m iffy on underlined in red helps  <br/>\nreinforce the right and wrong spelling. And I *want* to spell well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe teens are usually when kids start wanting to spell well because  <br/>\nthey&#39;re doing more communicating in writing (IMs, email, message  <br/>\nboards, etc.) And they learn quickly because they want to learn. It&#39;s  <br/>\nreally as simple as that :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have plans of using math workbooks<br/>\n&gt; until she masters the facts, and phonics to strengthen her spelling<br/>\n&gt; skills;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What the people on the list do at home is up to them. What people  <br/>\nbring to the list to share is where we can help them -- and other  <br/>\nreading -- see ways to move closer to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s some questions to think about.

My name is <br/>\nLynn, and my 10 year old dd has just begun unschooling. I&#39;m not <br/>\nentirely clear on what this is, but I&#39;m glad to know it is not <br/>\nfollowing someone else&#39;s rigorous schedule. We had tried <br/>\nhomeschooling-well maybe it was more of virtual schooling, which is <br/>\npublic school ciriculum at home. Within 2 months we were both <br/>\nfrustrated, burned out, and behind. As we began traveling/camping, <br/>\nthings became impossible. No longer residng full time in Wisconsin, <br/>\nmy dd was no longer eligible for the program. Over the holidays, I <br/>\njust let <br/>\nher decompensate and enjoy life. She has now begun to write, read <br/>\nchildren&#39;s classics, is working on spelling and art as well as <br/>\ncomputer skills, all without even realizing that she has begun <br/>\nunschooling. It&#39;s natural, and I&#39;m already seeing the dd she used to <br/>\nbe before trying to fit in the educational mold.

Math has been her most difficult subject, as she never <br/>\nmemorised the basic facts. She&#39;s able to work problems, but those <br/>\nbasic facts hinder her speed and confidence. She also has become an <br/>\naccomplished reader <br/>\nwithout the ability to spell. I have plans of using math workbooks <br/>\nuntil she masters the facts, and phonics to strengthen her spelling <br/>\nskills; however, I am confused about how to satisfy state schooling <br/>\nstatutes. Additionally, I&#39;m not ceratin what state to use, as we are <br/>\nspending time in several states for periods of 3-6 months. I have <br/>\nsome property in Wiscoonsin, but do not anticipate spending more <br/>\nthan a few months there this year. Lastly, I could use some tips in <br/>\nplanning/documentation/organization.
