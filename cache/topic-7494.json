If you&#39;re<br/>\ntrying to counteract a really negative label then a more empowering<br/>\nlabel can be good.  OR even better is to get out of the labeling<br/>\nbusiness altogether and find ways around the blame game.  So often,<br/>\nknowing who or what causes a person&#39;s life to be different, like you<br/>\nsaid, doesn&#39;t yield a useful strategy for living that life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest problem with labeling children is that such things comfort<br/>\nadults (parents, grandparents, teachers, administrators, doctors,<br/>\npsychologists and so on) while taking more power from children through<br/>\nassigned names, which are seldom sought or welcomed.  Entire<br/>\nlivelihoods<br/>\nare based the job of labeling and doing things *to* people rather than<br/>\nappreciating and doing things *for* and *with* them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the best of all worlds to spend the young years finding out for<br/>\nyourself who you are and what you will do.  The alternative is to spend<br/>\na chunk or the entirety of your adulthood shedding old undesirable<br/>\nlabels.  If a person doesn&#39;t use their power someone else will.  The<br/>\ngreatest gift is to protect children from bullying, labeling, and<br/>\nwhatever else robs them of personal power over their life.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nfrozenandcold wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;There is a whole lot of emotional and<br/>\n&gt; social issues which make them different. They process information <br/>\n&gt; about the<br/>\n&gt; world around them differently. Their emotions are magnified by 10. A <br/>\n&gt; gifted<br/>\n&gt; child knows they are different without having to be told. My son <br/>\n&gt; would tell<br/>\n&gt; you it&#39;s not a gift, it&#39;s a curse. He wishes he was like everyone <br/>\n&gt; else. &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This may be the case with your child, but I know a LOT of &quot;gifted&quot; <br/>\n&gt; children that aren&#39;t any different, they just get really good grades <br/>\n&gt; and are considered very &quot;academic&quot; and &quot;apply&quot; themselves.  I think <br/>\n&gt; EVERYONE perceives the world differently and I think EVERYONE learns <br/>\n&gt; differently.  The problem with the public school system is that it <br/>\n&gt; is only set up to accommodate one type of learner, thus the need <br/>\n&gt; for &quot;resource&quot; and &quot;gifted&quot; program.  Even those in the &quot;gifted&quot; <br/>\n&gt; program are usually only considered &quot;gifted&quot; in one or two areas.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My son happens to be &quot;highly sensitive&quot; and it is good to understand <br/>\n&gt; how his brain works and to have the support of others that have <br/>\n&gt; children like him, at the same time 20% of people in this country <br/>\n&gt; are like him so is it really necessary to assign a label?  My <br/>\n&gt; husband was considered slightly dyslexic but they never labeled him <br/>\n&gt; and he figured out ways to function within that, he never felt <br/>\n&gt; different but knew that he had to find ways around it.  I think we <br/>\n&gt; are all &quot;different&quot; and have different ways of functioning in this <br/>\n&gt; world.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree that it is good to understand the deeper meaning of the <br/>\n&gt; label but that doesn&#39;t mean we have to actually label.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Heidi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!

They process information<br/>\n&gt; about the<br/>\n&gt; world around them differently. Their emotions are magnified by 10. A<br/>\n&gt; gifted<br/>\n&gt; child knows they are different without having to be told. My son<br/>\n&gt; would tell<br/>\n&gt; you it&#39;s not a gift, it&#39;s a curse.

Gifted children very often don&#39;t &quot;apply&quot;<br/>\nthemselves - they know they can pass a typical class without having to. They<br/>\naren&#39;t the ones eagerly answering the teacher&#39;s questions - they are the<br/>\nones asking the questions the teacher can&#39;t answer. They aren&#39;t the ones who<br/>\nspend hours on end on their homework - they are the ones who do their<br/>\nhomework at the last minute during the teacher&#39;s lectures instead of<br/>\nlistening to the teacher - illegibly scrawling out the correct answers -<br/>\noften without even bothering to show the necessary work because they just<br/>\n&quot;knew&quot; the right answers. They aren&#39;t the ones who study ahead of time for<br/>\ntests - they are the ones that come into class late, realize everyone is<br/>\ndoing a test, borrow a pencil and still finish the test first and get the<br/>\nhighest score.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school, gifted children are troublemakers - bored with class, with too<br/>\nmuch time on their hands and a load of really interesting ideas that are<br/>\npretty much guaranteed to piss off the school teachers and administrators (I<br/>\nhad one friend who built a rocket out of a box of matches and set it off in<br/>\nschool - he showed an understanding of mechanics, force and motion WELL<br/>\nbeyond his peers and got suspended for it). They are often mis labeled as<br/>\nadhd - even told they are stupid. They do NOT fit in with the rest of the<br/>\nschool - even when they are &quot;behaving.&quot; Their peers don&#39;t understand them<br/>\nand the teachers don&#39;t have time to deal with them - they are too busy<br/>\ndealing with the kids who are struggling with the material.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople assume that gifted children have it easy - after all, they understand<br/>\nthe material presented to them. They assume that a gifted child&#39;s emotions<br/>\nkeep in pace with their intellect and expect him to show a level of maturity<br/>\nthat they would NEVER expect from his peers, and then when he fails to live<br/>\nup to their expectations, they blame him. They don&#39;t understand the drive a<br/>\ngifted child has for learning that interests him to the exclusion of all<br/>\nelse. They can&#39;t relate.<br/>\nJust my two cents on the matter - really, none of the above applies when you<br/>\nare unschooling :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nDaniel<br/>\n( Blogging at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://key-words.blogspot.com/\">http://key-words.blogspot.com/</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":236897304,"authorName":"frozenandcold","from":"&quot;frozenandcold&quot; &lt;fivefreebirds@...&gt;","profile":"frozenandcold","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"re: gifted children","postDate":"1131061257","msgId":7494,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrZTc2OStjYjlwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7505,"prevInTime":7493,"nextInTime":7495,"topicId":7494,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-631292770\">&lt;There is a whole lot of emotional and<br/>\nsocial issues which make them different.

The problem with the public school system is that it <br/>\nis only set up to accommodate one type of learner, thus the need <br/>\nfor &quot;resource&quot; and &quot;gifted&quot; program.

My <br/>\nhusband was considered slightly dyslexic but they never labeled him <br/>\nand he figured out ways to function within that, he never felt <br/>\ndifferent but knew that he had to find ways around it.
