I have a question about my 4 year old daughter, <br/>\nPaige (actually, I have a lot of questions, but I&#39;ll limit it to this <br/>\none to start!).<br/>\n<br/>\nPaige has recently developed many habits, possibly tics (like her <br/>\nolder sister, Tess (7 years old) who has TS). One of them is <br/>\nconstant picking of boo-boos. She has many of them on her body <br/>\n(mostly on her legs, her tushie and one behind her ear) at this <br/>\npoint. All of which started from a tiny dot of a boo-boo, many of <br/>\nthem are now up to 1 cm in width. Sometimes I can see blood dripping <br/>\nfrom them. Sometimes I find blood stains on her pant legs or on the <br/>\nback of her underwear.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months ago, she started licking her lips excessively, and <br/>\ndeveloped a huge ring around her mouth. I knew (from past experience <br/>\nwith Tess), that there was not much I could do about it, and at first <br/>\nI offered her unpetroleum jelly or lip balm. She started to become <br/>\nsensitive to it, so I backed off, told her she knew her body and <br/>\ncould decide if she needed to put something on her sores. I can say <br/>\nthat the sores around her mouth have alternated between getting <br/>\nbetter or getting no worse than before, so I think it was a good <br/>\nstrategy. So, I tried the same approach with the boo-boos, but it&#39;s <br/>\nnot working. Lately, it&#39;s really making me crazy to see them <br/>\nbleeding and getting bigger so I&#39;ve been reminding her to stop <br/>\npicking, and she gets really mad at me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a personal history with this particular topic in that I was <br/>\na pretty neglected child, and one of the ways in which I remember <br/>\nthis most clearly was that I had tiny sores that grew into gigantic <br/>\nboo-boos on my tush. I was not as young as Paige, I was probably 7 <br/>\nor so. I picked them until they bled, and I remember thinking they <br/>\nwould go away each time I picked them off. They got bigger and <br/>\nbigger until my whole backside was a huge scab. Finally I &quot;allowed&quot; <br/>\nit to be discovered by my grandmother, at a sleepover at her home. I <br/>\nremember an ER trip after that, I also remember my father often <br/>\nsaying to me (even into adulthood) that I &quot;hid my illnesses from <br/>\nthem&quot; (which I did - not just in this case, but in other ways too), <br/>\nand I took the &quot;shame&quot; of this into my adulthood, until I one day <br/>\nrealized that I WAS A KID and no one was looking after me!<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though, I know that I am looking after my kids, I&#39;m sure part of <br/>\nmy reaction could be about being really, really sure that I am not <br/>\nneglecting them the way that I was. But, I do think that even <br/>\nwithout my personal history with this particular issue, I still feel <br/>\nlike this is something I want to try to help her to stop doing - I <br/>\nworry that she will have scars, or they could become infected. <br/>\nSometimes I try to stop her from doing it, which makes her really mad <br/>\n(and we have some other stresses in our relationship, which I&#39;m sure <br/>\nI&#39;ll post in the future, so fighting over boo-boos is not really <br/>\nhelping us! In short, I&#39;ve been stressed out lately, and have not <br/>\nbeen the parent I would like to be).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, sometimes I think I should just totally let it go, and she <br/>\nwill work it out. Today, she tried to hide the fact that she had <br/>\npicked a boo-boo from me (she told me that she didn&#39;t know where the <br/>\nblood on her finger came from, with totally wide open &quot;trust me&quot; <br/>\neyes). I told her that it didn&#39;t matter to me if she did, I just <br/>\nwanted to see the one that was picked, to see if was okay. She <br/>\nreally insisted that she hadn&#39;t picked at all. Yikes! I know she is <br/>\nfeeling pretty bad about this to say that to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night we were watching a TS video with Tess and one of the <br/>\nchildren mentioned a tic where he was scratching the same spot over <br/>\nand over, until it bled. I asked Paige tonight if she feels like she <br/>\nhas to pick them. She said that &quot;her body tells her too&quot; (similar <br/>\nanswer to what Tess would say about her tics). I&#39;ve recently thought <br/>\nthat Paige might also have tics, but it never occurred to me until <br/>\ntoday that the boo-boo picking could be one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I would love to hear what people on this list think about <br/>\nthis. It probably seems like a small problem, but I wonder if it&#39;s a <br/>\ngood example of the type of power-struggle I can get into with my <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie (in NJ)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n         <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNo need to miss a message.
