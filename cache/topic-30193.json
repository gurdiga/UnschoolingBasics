After all, I&#39;ve never written a <br/>\nbook or even an article about home schooling or unschooling. I&#39;ve been <br/>\ncalled a number of things: a futurist, a planetary philosopher, an <br/>\nanthropologist from Mars. Recently I was introduced to an audience as a <br/>\ncultural critic, and I think this probably says it best. As you&#39;ll see, <br/>\nin my talk to you today, I will be trying to place schooling and <br/>\nunschooling in the larger context of our cultural history and that of <br/>\nour species as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar with my work, I should begin by <br/>\nexplaining what I mean by &quot;our culture.&quot; Rather than burden you with a <br/>\ndefinition, I&#39;ll give you a simple test that you can use wherever you <br/>\ngo in the world. If the food in that part of the world is under lock <br/>\nand key, and the people who live there have to work to get it, then <br/>\nyou&#39;re among people of our culture. If you happen to be in a jungle in <br/>\nthe interior of Brazil or New Guinea, however, you&#39;ll find that the <br/>\nfood is not under lock and key. It&#39;s simply out there for the taking, <br/>\nand anyone who wants some can just go and get it. The people who live <br/>\nin these areas, often called aboriginals, stone-age peoples, or tribal <br/>\npeoples clearly belong to a culture radically different from our own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI first began to focus my attention on the peculiarities of our own <br/>\nculture in the early 1960s, when I went to work for what was then a <br/>\ncutting-edge publisher of educational materials, Science Research <br/>\nAssociates. I was in my mid-twenties and as thoroughly acculturated as <br/>\nany senator, bus-driver, movie star, or medical doctor. My fundamental <br/>\nacceptances about the universe and humanity&#39;s place in it were <br/>\nrock-solid and thoroughly conventional.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it was a stressful time to be alive, in some ways even more <br/>\nstressful than the present. Many people nowadays realize that human <br/>\nlife may well be in jeopardy, but this jeopardy exists in some vaguely <br/>\ndefined future, twenty or fifty or a hundred years hence. But in those <br/>\ncoldest days of the Cold War everyone lived with the realization that a <br/>\nnuclear holocaust could occur literally at any second, without warning. <br/>\nIt was very realistically the touch of a button away.<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman life would not be entirely snuffed out in a holocaust of this <br/>\nkind. In a way, it would be even worse than that. In a matter of hours, <br/>\nwe would be thrown back not just to the Stone Age but to a level of <br/>\nalmost total helplessness. In the Stone Age, after all, people lived <br/>\nperfectly well without supermarkets, shopping malls, hardware stores, <br/>\nand all the elaborate systems that keep these places stocked with the <br/>\nthings we need. Within hours our cities would disintegrate into chaos <br/>\nand anarchy, and the necessities of life would vanish from store <br/>\nshelves, never to be replaced. Within days famine would be widespread.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills that are taken for granted among Stone Age peoples would be <br/>\nunknown to the survivors--the ability to differentiate between edible <br/>\nand inedible foods growing in their own environment, the ability to <br/>\nstalk, kill, dress, and preserve game animals, and most important the <br/>\nability to make tools from available materials. How many of you know <br/>\nhow to cure a hide? How to make a rope from scratch? How to flake a <br/>\nstone tool? Much less how to smelt metal from raw ore. Commonplace <br/>\nskills of the paleolithic, developed over thousands of years, would be <br/>\nlost arts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this was freely acknowledged by people who didn&#39;t doubt for a <br/>\nmoment that we were living the way humans were meant to live from the <br/>\nbeginning of time, who didn&#39;t doubt for a moment that the things our <br/>\nchildren were learning in school were exactly the things they should be <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d been hired at SRA to work on a major new mathematics program that <br/>\nhad been under development for several years in Cleveland. In my first <br/>\nyear, we were going to publish the kindergarten and first-grade <br/>\nprograms. In the second year, we&#39;d publish the second-grade program, in <br/>\nthe third year, the third-grade program, and so on. Working on the <br/>\nkindergarten and first-grade programs, I observed something that I <br/>\nthought was truly remarkable. In these grades, children spend most of <br/>\ntheir time learning things that no one growing up in our culture could <br/>\npossibly avoid learning. For example, they learn the names of the <br/>\nprimary colors. Wow, just imagine missing school on the day when they <br/>\nwere learning blue. You&#39;d spend the rest of your life wondering what <br/>\ncolor the sky is. They learn to tell time, to count, and to add and <br/>\nsubtract, as if anyone could possibly fail to learn these things in <br/>\nthis culture. And of course they make the beginnings of learning how to <br/>\nread. I&#39;ll go out on a limb here and suggest an experiment. Two classes <br/>\nof 30 kids, taught identically and given the identical text materials <br/>\nthroughout their school experience, but one class is given no <br/>\ninstruction in reading at all and the other is given the usual <br/>\ninstruction. Call it the Quinn Conjecture: both classes will test the <br/>\nsame on reading skills at the end of twelve years. I feel safe in <br/>\nmaking this conjecture because ultimately kids learn to read the same <br/>\nway they learn to speak, by hanging around people who read and by <br/>\nwanting to be able to do what these people do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurred to me at this time to ask this question: Instead of <br/>\nspending two or three years teaching children things they will <br/>\ninevitably learn anyway, why not teach them some things they will not <br/>\ninevitably learn and that they would actually enjoy learning at this <br/>\nage? How to navigate by the stars, for example. How to tan a hide. How <br/>\nto distinguish edible foods from inedible foods. How to build a shelter <br/>\n from scratch. How to make tools from scratch. How to make a canoe. How <br/>\nto track animals--all the forgotten but still valuable skills that our <br/>\ncivilization is actually built on.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I didn&#39;t have to vocalize this idea to anyone to know how it <br/>\nwould be received. Being thoroughly acculturated, I could myself <br/>\nexplain why it was totally inane. The way we live is the way humans <br/>\nwere meant to live from the beginning of time, and our children were <br/>\nbeing prepared to enter that life. Those who came before us were <br/>\nsavages, little more than brutes. Those who continue to live the way <br/>\nour ancestors lived are savages, little more than brutes. The world is <br/>\nwell rid of them, and we&#39;re well rid of every vestige of them, <br/>\nincluding their ludicrously primitive skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur children were being prepared in school to step boldly into the only <br/>\nfully human life that had ever existed on this planet. The skills they <br/>\nwere acquiring in school would bring them not only success but deep <br/>\npersonal fulfillment on every level. What did it matter if they never <br/>\ndid more than work in some mind-numbing factory job? They could parse a <br/>\nsentence! They could explain to you the difference between a Petrarchan <br/>\nsonnet and a Shakespearean sonnet! They could extract a square root! <br/>\nThey could show you why the square of the two sides of a right triangle <br/>\nwere equal to the square of the hypotenuse! They could analyze a poem! <br/>\nThey could explain to you how a bill passes congress! They could very <br/>\npossibly trace for you the economic causes of the Civil War. They had <br/>\nread Melville and Shakespeare, so why would they not now read <br/>\nDostoevsky and Racine, Joyce and Beckett, Faulkner and O&#39;Neill? But <br/>\nabove all else, of course, the citizen&#39;s education--grades K to <br/>\ntwelve--prepared children to be fully-functioning participants in this <br/>\ngreat civilization of ours. The day after their graduation exercises, <br/>\nthey were ready to stride confidently toward any goal they might set <br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\nOf course, then, as now, everyone knew that the citizen&#39;s education was <br/>\ndoing no such thing. It was perceived then--as now--that there was <br/>\nsomething strangely wrong with the schools. They were failing--and <br/>\nfailing miserably--at delivering on these enticing promises. Ah well, <br/>\nteachers weren&#39;t being paid enough, so what could you expect? We raised <br/>\nteachers&#39; salaries--again and again and again--and still the schools <br/>\nfailed. Well, what could you expect? The schools were physically <br/>\ndecrepit, lightless, and uninspiring. We built new ones--tens of <br/>\nthousands, hundreds of thousands of them--and still the schools failed. <br/>\nWell, what could you expect? The curriculum was antiquated and <br/>\nirrelevant. We modernized the curriculum, did our damnedest to make it <br/>\nrelevant--and still the schools failed. Every week--then as now--you <br/>\ncould read about some bright new idea that would surely &quot;fix&quot; whatever <br/>\nwas wrong with our schools: the open classroom, team teaching, back to <br/>\nbasics, more homework, less homework, no homework--I couldn&#39;t begin to <br/>\nenumerate them all. Hundreds of these bright ideas were <br/>\nimplemented--thousands of them were implemented--and still the schools <br/>\nfailed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin our cultural matrix, every medium tells us that the schools <br/>\nexist to prepare children for a successful and fulfilling life in our <br/>\ncivilization (and are therefore failing). This is beyond argument, <br/>\nbeyond doubt, beyond question. In Ishmael I said that the voice of <br/>\nMother Culture speaks to us from every newspaper and magazine article, <br/>\nevery movie, every sermon, every book, every parent, every teacher, <br/>\nevery school administrator, and what she has to say about the schools <br/>\nis that they exist to prepare children for a successful and fulfilling <br/>\nlife in our civilization (and are therefore failing). Once we step <br/>\noutside our cultural matrix, this voice no longer fills our ears and <br/>\nwe&#39;re free to ask some new questions. Suppose the schools aren&#39;t <br/>\nfailing? Suppose they&#39;re doing exactly what we really want them to <br/>\ndo--but don&#39;t wish to examine and acknowledge?<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted that the schools do a poor job of preparing children for a <br/>\nsuccessful and fulfilling life in our civilization, but what things do <br/>\nthey do excellently well? Well, to begin with, they do a superb job of <br/>\nkeeping young people out of the job market. Instead of becoming <br/>\nwage-earners at age twelve or fourteen, they remain consumers only--and <br/>\nthey consume billions of dollars worth of merchandise, using money that <br/>\ntheir parents earn. Just imagine what would happen to our economy if <br/>\novernight the high schools closed their doors. Instead of having fifty <br/>\nmillion active consumers out there, we would suddenly have fifty <br/>\nmillion unemployed youth. It would be nothing short of an economic <br/>\ncatastrophe.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course the situation was very different two hundred years ago, when <br/>\nwe were still a primarily agrarian society. Youngsters were expected <br/>\nand needed to become workers at age ten, eleven, and twelve. For the <br/>\nmasses, a fourth, fifth, or sixth-grade education was deemed perfectly <br/>\nadequate. But as the character of our society changed, fewer youngsters <br/>\nwere needed for farm work, and the enactment of child-labor laws soon <br/>\nmade it impossible to put ten-, eleven-, and twelve-year-olds to work <br/>\nin factories. It was necessary to keep them off the streets--and where <br/>\nbetter than in schools? Naturally, new material had to be inserted into <br/>\nthe curriculum to fill up the time. It didn&#39;t much matter what it was. <br/>\nHave them memorize the capitals of every state. Have them memorize the <br/>\nprinciple products of every state. Have them learn the steps a bill <br/>\ntakes in passing Congress. No one wondered or cared if these were <br/>\nthings kids wanted to know or needed to know--or would ever need to <br/>\nknow. No one wondered or ever troubled to find out if the material <br/>\nbeing added to the curriculum was retained. The educators didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto know, and, really, what difference would it make? It didn&#39;t matter <br/>\nthat, once learned, they were immediately forgotten. It filled up some <br/>\ntime. The law decreed that an eighth-grade education was essential for <br/>\nevery citizen, and so curriculum writers provided material needed for <br/>\nan eighth-grade education.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the Great Depression it became urgently important to keep young <br/>\npeople off the job market for as long as possible, and so it came to be <br/>\nunderstood that a twelfth-grade education was essential for every <br/>\ncitizen. As before, it didn&#39;t much matter what was added to fill up the <br/>\ntime, so long as it was marginally plausible. Let&#39;s have them learn how <br/>\nto analyze a poem, even if they never read another one in their whole <br/>\nadult life. Let&#39;s have them read a great classic novel, even if they <br/>\nnever read another one in their whole adult life. Let&#39;s have them study <br/>\nworld history, even if it all just goes in one ear and out the other. <br/>\nLet&#39;s have them study Euclidean geometry, even if two years later they <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t prove a single theorem to save their lives. All these things <br/>\nand many, many more were of course justified on the basis that they <br/>\nwould contribute to the success and rich fulfilment that these children <br/>\nwould experience as adults. Except, of course, that it didn&#39;t. But no <br/>\none wanted to know about that. No one would have dreamed of testing <br/>\nyoung people five years after graduation to find out how much of it <br/>\nthey&#39;d retained. No one would have dreamed of asking them how useful it <br/>\nhad been to them in realistic terms or how much it had contributed to <br/>\ntheir success and fulfilment as humans. What would be the point of <br/>\nasking them to evaluate their education? What did they know about it, <br/>\nafter all? They were just high-school graduates, not professional <br/>\neducators.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the Second World War, no one knew what the economic <br/>\nfuture was going to be like. With the disappearance of the war <br/>\nindustries, would the country fall back into the pre-war depression <br/>\nslump? The word began to go out that the citizen&#39;s education should <br/>\nreally include four years of college. Everyone should go to college. As <br/>\nthe economy continued to grow, however, this injunction began to be <br/>\nsoftened. Four years of college would sure be good for you, but it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t part of the citizen&#39;s education, which ultimately remained a <br/>\ntwelfth-grade education.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was in the good years following the war, when there were often more <br/>\njobs than workers to fill them, that our schools began to be perceived <br/>\nas failing. With ready workers in demand, it was apparent that kids <br/>\nwere coming out of school without knowing much more than the <br/>\nsixth-grade graduates of a century ago. They&#39;d &quot;gone through&quot; all the <br/>\nmaterial that had been added to fill up the time--analyzed poetry, <br/>\ndiagramed sentences, proved theorems, solved for x, plowed through <br/>\nthousands of pages of history and literature, written bushels of <br/>\nthemes, but for the most part they retained almost none of it--and of <br/>\nhow much use would it be to them if they had? From a business point of <br/>\nview, these high-school graduates were barely employable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut of course by then the curriculum had achieved the status of <br/>\nscripture, and it was too late to acknowledge that the program had <br/>\nnever been designed to be useful. The educators&#39; response to the <br/>\nbusiness community was, &quot;We just have to give the kids more of the <br/>\nsame--more poems to analyze, more sentences to diagram, more theorems <br/>\nto prove, more equations to solve, more pages of history and literature <br/>\nto read, more themes to write, and so on.&quot; No one was about to <br/>\nacknowledge that the program had been set up to keep young people off <br/>\nthe job market--and that it had done a damn fine job of that at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut keeping young people off the job market is only half of what the <br/>\nschools do superbly well. By the age of thirteen or fourteen, children <br/>\nin aboriginal societies--tribal societies--have completed what we, from <br/>\nour point of view, would call their &quot;education.&quot; They&#39;re ready to <br/>\n&quot;graduate&quot; and become adults. In these societies, what this means is <br/>\nthat their survival value is 100%. All their elders could disappear <br/>\novernight, and there wouldn&#39;t be chaos, anarchy, and famine among these <br/>\nnew adults. They would be able to carry on without a hitch. None of the <br/>\nskills and technologies practiced by their parents would be lost. If <br/>\nthey wanted to, they could live quite independently of the tribal <br/>\nstructure in which they were reared.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the last thing we want our children to be able to do is to live <br/>\nindependently of our society. We don&#39;t want our graduates to have a <br/>\nsurvival value of 100%, because this would make them free to opt out of <br/>\nour carefully constructed economic system and do whatever they please. <br/>\nWe don&#39;t want them to do whatever they please, we want them to have <br/>\nexactly two choices (assuming they&#39;re not independently wealthy). Get a <br/>\njob or go to college. Either choice is good for us, because we need a <br/>\nconstant supply of entry-level workers and we also need doctors, <br/>\nlawyers, physicists, mathematicians, psychologists, geologists, <br/>\nbiologists, school teachers, and so on. The citizen&#39;s education <br/>\naccomplishes this almost without fail. Ninety-nine point nine percent <br/>\nof our high school graduates make one of these two choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it should be noted that our high-school graduates are reliably <br/>\nentry-level workers. We want them to have to grab the lowest rung on <br/>\nthe ladder. What sense would it make to give them skills that would <br/>\nmake it possible for them to grab the second rung or the third rung? <br/>\nThose are the rungs their older brothers and sisters are reaching for. <br/>\nAnd if this year&#39;s graduates were reaching for the second or third <br/>\nrungs, who would be doing the work at the bottom? The business people <br/>\nwho do the hiring constantly complain that graduates know absolutely <br/>\nnothing, have virtually no useful skills at all. But in truth how could <br/>\nit be otherwise?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you see that our schools are not failing, they&#39;re just succeeding in <br/>\nways we prefer not to see. Turning out graduates with no skills, with <br/>\nno survival value, and with no choice but to work or starve are not <br/>\nflaws of the system, they are features of the system. These are the <br/>\nthings the system must do to keep things going on as they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe need for schooling is bolstered by two well-entrenched pieces of <br/>\ncultural mythology. The first and most pernicious of these is that <br/>\nchildren will not learn unless they&#39;re compelled to--in school. It is <br/>\npart of the mythology of childhood itself that children hate learning <br/>\nand will avoid it at all costs. Of course, anyone who has had a child <br/>\nknows what an absurd lie this is. From infancy onward, children are the <br/>\nmost fantastic learners in the world. If they grow up in a family in <br/>\nwhich four languages are spoken, they will be speaking four languages <br/>\nby the time they&#39;re three or four years old--without a day of <br/>\nschooling, just by hanging around the members of their family, because <br/>\nthey desperately want to be able to do the things they do. Anyone who <br/>\nhas had a child knows that they are tirelessly curious. As soon as <br/>\nthey&#39;re able to ask questions, they ask questions incessantly, often <br/>\ndriving their parents to distraction. Their curiosity extends to <br/>\neverything they can reach, which is why every parent soon learns to put <br/>\nanything breakable, anything dangerous, anything untouchable up <br/>\nhigh--and if possible behind lock and key. We all know the truth of the <br/>\njoke about those childproof bottle caps: those are the kind that only <br/>\nchildren can open.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who imagine that children are resistant to learning have a <br/>\nnonexistent understanding of how human culture developed in the first <br/>\nplace. Culture is no more and no less than the totality of learned <br/>\nbehavior and information that is passed from one generation to the <br/>\nnext. The desire to eat is not transmitted by culture, but knowledge <br/>\nabout how edible foods are found, collected, and processed is <br/>\ntransmitted by culture. Before the invention of writing, whatever was <br/>\nnot passed on from one generation to the next was simply lost, no <br/>\nmatter what it was--a technique, a song, a detail of history. Among <br/>\naboriginal peoples--those we haven&#39;t destroyed--the transmission <br/>\nbetween generations is remarkably complete, but of course not 100% <br/>\ncomplete. There will always be trivial details of personal history that <br/>\nthe older generation takes to its grave. But the vital material is <br/>\nnever lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis comes about because the desire to learn is hardwired into the <br/>\nhuman child just the way that the desire to reproduce is hardwired into <br/>\nthe human adult. It&#39;s genetic. If there was ever a strain of humans <br/>\nwhose children were not driven to learn, they&#39;re long gone, because <br/>\nthey could not be culture-bearers.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren don&#39;t have to be motivated to learn everything they can about <br/>\nthe world they inhabit, they&#39;re absolutely driven to learn it. By the <br/>\nonset of puberty, children in aboriginal societies have unfailingly <br/>\nlearned everything they need to function as adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of it this way. In the most general terms, the human biological <br/>\nclock is set for two alarms. When the first alarm goes off, at birth, <br/>\nthe clock chimes learn, learn, learn, learn, learn. When the second <br/>\nalarm goes off, at the onset of puberty, the clock chimes mate, mate, <br/>\nmate, mate, mate. The chime that goes learn, learn, learn never <br/>\ndisappears entirely, but it becomes relatively faint at the onset of <br/>\npuberty. At that point, children cease to want to follow their parents <br/>\naround in the learning dance. Instead, they want to follow each other <br/>\naround in the mating dance.<br/>\nWe, of course, in our greater wisdom have decreed that the biological <br/>\nclock regulated by our genes must be ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat sells most people on the idea of school is the fact that the <br/>\nunschooled child learns what it wants to learn when it wants to learn <br/>\nit. This is intolerable to them, because they&#39;re convinced that <br/>\nchildren don&#39;t want to learn anything at all--and they point to school <br/>\nchildren to prove it. What they fail to recognize is that the learning <br/>\ncurve of preschool children swoops upward like a mountain--but quickly <br/>\nlevels off when they enter school. By the third or fourth grade it&#39;s <br/>\ncompletely flat for most kids. Learning, such as it is, has become a <br/>\nboring, painful experience they&#39;d love to be able to avoid if they <br/>\ncould. But there&#39;s another reason why people abhor the idea of children <br/>\nlearning what they want to learn when they want to learn it. They won&#39;t <br/>\nall learn the same things! Some of them will never learn to analyze a <br/>\npoem! Some of them will never learn to parse a sentence or write a <br/>\ntheme! Some of them will never read Julius Caesar! Some will never <br/>\nlearn geometry! Some will never dissect a frog! Some will never learn <br/>\nhow a bill passes Congress! Well, of course, this is too horrible to <br/>\nimagine. It doesn&#39;t matter that 90% of these students will never read <br/>\nanother poem or another play by Shakespeare in their lives. It doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter that 90% of them will never have occasion to parse another <br/>\nsentence or write another theme in their lives. It doesn&#39;t matter that <br/>\n90% retain no functional knowledge of the geometry or algebra they <br/>\nstudied. It doesn&#39;t matter that 90% never have any use for whatever <br/>\nknowledge they were supposed to gain from dissecting a frog. It doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter that 90% graduate without having the vaguest idea how a bill <br/>\npasses Congress. All that matters is that they&#39;ve gone through it!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people who are horrified by the idea of children learning what they <br/>\nwant to learn when they want to learn it have not accepted the very <br/>\nelementary psychological fact that people (all people, of every age) <br/>\nremember the things that are important to them--the things they need to <br/>\nknow--and forget the rest. I am a living witness to this fact. I went <br/>\nto one of the best prep schools in the country and graduated fourth in <br/>\nmy class, and I doubt very much if I could now get a passing grade in <br/>\nmore than two or three of the dozens of courses I took. I studied <br/>\nclassical Greek for two solid years, and now would be unable to read <br/>\naloud a single sentence.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne final argument people advance to support the idea that children <br/>\nneed all the schooling we give them is that there is vastly more <br/>\nmaterial to be learned today than there was in prehistoric times or <br/>\neven a century ago. Well, there is of course vastly more material that <br/>\ncan be learned, but we all know perfectly well that it isn&#39;t being <br/>\ntaught in grades K to twelve. Whole vast new fields of knowledge exist <br/>\ntoday--things no one even heard of a century ago: astrophysics, <br/>\nbiochemistry, paleobiology, aeronautics, particle physics, ethology, <br/>\ncytopathology, neurophysiology--I could list them for hours. But are <br/>\nthese the things that we have jammed into the K-12 curriculum because <br/>\neveryone needs to know them? Certainly not. The idea is absurd. The <br/>\nidea that children need to be schooled for a long time because there is <br/>\nso much that can be learned is absurd. If the citizen&#39;s education were <br/>\nto be extended to include everything that can be learned, it wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nrun to grade twelve, it would run to grade twelve thousand, and no one <br/>\nwould be able to graduate in a single lifetime.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know of course that there is no one in this audience who needs to be <br/>\nsold on the virtues of home schooling or unschooling. I hope, however, <br/>\nthat I may have been able to add some philosophical, historical, <br/>\nanthropological, and biological foundation for your conviction that <br/>\nschool ain&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMore new features than ever.
