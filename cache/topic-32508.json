The human brain changes qualitatively, not <br/>\nquantitatively, during the course of it&#39;s development.  These changes <br/>\noccur at specific age ranges.  Formal operations, the stage to which <br/>\nyou are refering, begins during adolescence.  It has nothing to do <br/>\nwith school level.  It has to do with biological maturity.  Only <br/>\nabout 30% of high school graduates actually achieve formal <br/>\noperations.  If high school was responsible for critical thinking <br/>\nskills, then 100% of high school graduates would achieve this level <br/>\nof brain funtioning.

I&#39;ve read them in real life from non-textbook sources.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re confusing the distilled information that might come from a  <br/>\nChemistry class with information that might get labeled &quot;Chemistry.&quot;  <br/>\nYou don&#39;t need a chemistry class to acquire information about  <br/>\nchemistry. Chemistry exists in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s *much* more useful to know how to question things and how to  <br/>\nresearch something than it is to memorize what someone else thinks  <br/>\nmight be useful to know. One reason is that if an answer doesn&#39;t come  <br/>\nwith a need to know, it&#39;s likely to be forgotten. (That&#39;s where 2  <br/>\nyears of Spanish went!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; lets see as we start to postulate what is making our kids sick in  <br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; environment, unless we have some understanding of such things we will<br/>\n&gt; discount many of the baseline information that can be quite helpful in<br/>\n&gt; pointing us and our doctors in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And people learn to question experts by sitting in classrooms for 12+  <br/>\nyears under the philosophy of &quot;Sit down, shut up, do what you&#39;re told  <br/>\nand we&#39;ll hand you what you need to know&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you attend an unschooling conference you&#39;ll meet kids who aren&#39;t  <br/>\nfacing life unexamined. Can the same be said of schooled kids? How  <br/>\nmany schooled kids reach the end of high school with no idea what  <br/>\nthey want to do? How many go onto college, switching majors until  <br/>\nthey hit on something that isn&#39;t too hard?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a schooled kid comes out of school critically thinking it&#39;s in  <br/>\nspite of school not because of it. Unschooled parents know that  <br/>\nbecause our kids *do* think critically without school. (Though my  <br/>\ndaughter did attend 2 months of 2nd grade. Maybe that was key and why  <br/>\nshe thinks critically now!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I actually while<br/>\n&gt; really leaning on those critical foundational issues of the early<br/>\n&gt; elementary education am of the sense that my high school years and<br/>\n&gt; beyond is where i really learned to critically think.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But apparently not to write clearly. Big words and unclear sentences  <br/>\ncan flummox people into believing that someone knows what they&#39;re  <br/>\ntalking about, but it won&#39;t fly here. Everything that passes through  <br/>\nhere is scrutinized and turned inside out and upside down. Lack of  <br/>\nclarity just wastes time. Please reread what you write before  <br/>\nclicking send. Please put in paragraphs to separate topics. Don&#39;t  <br/>\nwaste your and our time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I understand what you said above, I&#39;d counter that if everyone  <br/>\ngave children walking lessons beginning at 9 mos then everyone would  <br/>\nthink the walking lessons were responsible for children walking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sound ridiculous, and yet, without a control group of kids who  <br/>\nare not schooled, you and 99% of the people in the US assume that  <br/>\npeople learn because of school. Why *would* they believe anything  <br/>\nelse? If school is unnecessary for learning, if school just exists  <br/>\nand the kids would learn anyway, then all those people who&#39;ve  <br/>\ndedicated their lives to education are wasting their time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat statement is too broad. Unschooling takes more than removing  <br/>\nschools. It takes parents dedicated to their kids and helping them  <br/>\nexplore the world. Not every parent wants to or is in a position to.  <br/>\nBut unschoolers do know from experience that learning not only  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t require schools, schools get in the way of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you see thinking<br/>\n&gt; is no wonder, fish think, but critical thinking is one of the things<br/>\n&gt; that truly separates even many people.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I see is someone who is critical of what he&#39;s reading. That&#39;s  <br/>\nnot the same as critical thinking. Understanding something new often  <br/>\ninvolves setting aside what we already believe to be true to see from  <br/>\na new point of view. To see from a new mountain top, you need to get  <br/>\ndown from your current mountain top. After examining everything from  <br/>\nthe new mountain top if you decide you like the old one better, you  <br/>\ncan always go back.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a Buddhist parable:<br/>\n=================<br/>\nWhen a Zen Master meets a new student, there is a tea ceremony. Tea  <br/>\nis poured into the student�s small hand-held cup until he or she  <br/>\ngives a small gesture to indicate �enough, thank you.�<br/>\n<br/>\nA long time ago there was a mind-full, accomplished, self-certain  <br/>\nmonk who arrived at a temple for training. The Master poured tea. The  <br/>\nyoung monk gestured and gestured to stop pouring, but the Master kept  <br/>\npouring tea until the cup overflowed. Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Master explained, �When you arrived, your cup was already so  <br/>\nfull, there was no room for new. Empty your cup. . .�<br/>\n<br/>\n=================<br/>\n<br/>\nAs long as you continue to question from what you believe to be true,  <br/>\nyou&#39;re not going to be able to understand.

He swam &quot;magically&quot; one day at four or five. Of <br/>\ncourse, it didn&#39;t all happen *that* day. The learning was happening for <br/>\nyears and years. The &quot;appearance&quot; of being a swimmer was simply obvious <br/>\non that day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI train dogs. It&#39;s part of my life. My kids *understand* how to work <br/>\nwith dogs because it&#39;s just a large part of our lives. They see me work <br/>\nwith them and are surrounded by dog training. I would say that they are <br/>\nalso &quot;dog trainers&quot;---but I can&#39;t say *when* that happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve recently become a gardener. They see me in the garden every day. <br/>\nThey are surrounded by beautiful plants and fruits and vegies. I talk <br/>\nabout my wonders and woes. It&#39;s a part of who we are---all that <br/>\ngrowing. What *day* are they considered gardeners?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all love to cook. Both boys have been in the kitchen preparing and <br/>\nplaying with food since they were born. I don&#39;t know that any of us <br/>\nknows &quot;when&quot; they became cooks---it was a process, but everyone&#39;s <br/>\ncomfortable in the kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\nBen and I don&#39;t play musical instruments, so that&#39;s NOT a daily part of <br/>\nour lives. We nevertheless have (at least one) musical child. He didn&#39;t <br/>\nget that from simply living with us and being exposed to instruments on <br/>\na regular basis. We had to make a special effort with music <br/>\nlearning---it wasn&#39;t by &quot;osmosis&quot; like lots of these other things, but <br/>\nit happened anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is BY FAR easiest when we are surrounded by and immersed in <br/>\nwhatever we&#39;re learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tell you what---does your husband speak another language?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, is he fluent?

If he <br/>\nisn&#39;t fluent, why NOT?<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning a language by being completely immersed in the language and <br/>\nculture is incredibly EASY. I mean---AMAZINGLY easy! Schools, though, <br/>\ndon&#39;t teach that way. Learning a second language in a &quot;schooly&quot; fashion <br/>\n(by being TAUGHT by rote) rarely (although I admit it&#39;s not impossible) <br/>\nproduces a fluent speaker. It&#39;s HARD that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving with a native-speaking family in the foreign country for six <br/>\nmonths can produce a confident, fluent speaker---with lots of <br/>\ncolloquialisms and slang and figures of speech. Four years of a typical <br/>\nhigh school language class often produces someone who can&#39;t even find a <br/>\nbathroom in the foreign country.<br/>\n<br/>\nImmerse your child in the written word (which is hard NOT to do in our <br/>\nculture), and he will read as soon as he is ready.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nStand above the crowd!

Four of the five were avid readers before <br/>\nkindergarten and struggled with boredom with the primitive books they had <br/>\nto use in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember consciously teaching them to read.  Between Sesame Street, <br/>\nwhich was new when my oldest was a toddler, and the fact that they were <br/>\nread to daily, and were part of a family that always read, they learned <br/>\nbecause they wanted to learn.  Same with basic math.  They understood <br/>\naddition, subtraction and multiplication because it was in games we played <br/>\nwhen we were together.  They also understood basic parts of search because <br/>\nwe talked about it.  If they said they were cold, I&#39;d asked where cold <br/>\nlived, and they would answer, &quot;On adjective street.&quot;  Sometimes I would say <br/>\nsomething like, &quot;that&#39;s right, right next to chilly and across from <br/>\nfreezing.&quot;  It was always a fun game for all of us.  They loved comparing <br/>\ndescriptive words and finding similar terms. They would have fun make their <br/>\nown list of neighbors.  We were free to follow their interests as far as <br/>\nthey wanted.  And free to not follow an interest if it didn&#39;t fit.

I do agree that whats normally taught in those grades is more essential. Basic reading and math skills, an idea of how to read a map ( or use mapquest, or ask for directions) so you can find where you need to go are more important than knowledge of traditional high school subjects. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  There are many many jobs out there.....all to one degree or another where people go through high school and /or college then realize that as far as the job is concerned they dont know *%$@ but pick up what they need to know quickly because it is useful and interesting to them. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  If a person decides to become a dog trainer to train service dogs, or search and rescue or whatever they would want to gather information about things like dog behavior , breed traits, history, etc. Basic knowlege of reading and math would be extremely useful as would experience working with others of different ages and backgrounds ( something not gotten in ps) . However unless their favorite weekend pasttime is making bombs all those high school chemistry and physics classes will probably be useless. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
