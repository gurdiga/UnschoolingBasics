What helps is being there. That is always what helps. Being able to redirect the energy into something else. I find that on days when they are really getting along, really having a good time together, playing World of Warcraft or setting up a clubhouse in a tent outside, I&#39;m too likely to take a break and to not be as nearby as I should be. It works much better if when I&#39;m doing something near them, playing WoW with them, or some kind of parallel play/activity. So, if they are outside, I&#39;m out there too, not necessarily doing the same thing, but present, and listening, just for the sounds of tension. How I approach it also makes a difference. They each have their own way that they want peace to be made. Simon doesn&#39;t want to discuss what happened. He wants me to figure out something else that I can do. Last night it was setting up his<br/>\n bed and plugging in a dvd player so that he could listen to Harry Potter when he woke up. Linnaea wants to talk about the thing for a bit, she wants to make sure that she isn&#39;t being blamed. She wants to rage against inequity for a bit. Then she wants a cuddle, and then she&#39;s done with the whole thing, but more likely to be fragile in the relationship for a little while. Once the peace has been broken, I need to be far more present than before. Usually it helps if I can join in the play. And again, that is my thing. It means that whatever I was doing can&#39;t be more important than being their very present mother. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe amazing thing is how much more quickly peace can be restored these days. Two days ago Simon got really upset over the way his shoes felt. We were trying to go to the library to see what DS games they had to rent and I was prepared to not go as soon as he collapsed on the floor. Within a few minutes of talking and seeing if he still wanted to go, he was fine. There have been days when that was the end. When the comfort of his shoes was enough to send him to his room under a blanket. As he has grown older, and probably, to a lesser extent, as I&#39;ve gotten better at not pushing my own agenda, he has become less stuck in his unhappiness. It goes for both of them working out issues together, as well. There are moments when I am nearby and I can hear tensions growing, when I can also hear them begin to look for solutions together to lessen the tension. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n===========<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main energy robber is when my kids start to fight and bicker between <br/>\neach other...I have 5 children, 3 of them very close in age and they <br/>\nare constantly going form being &quot;best friends&quot; to hating each other...I <br/>\nam hearing it go on all day, 24/7 and it makes me really wonder what <br/>\nsane mother would ever want to stay home and homeschool full time? it <br/>\nleaves me feeling the need for a nap(which is impossible with 5 kids)I <br/>\nmean it&#39;s enough to drive even a saint to drink!! lol I feel like the <br/>\nmore time we spend together and the more we get to know each other, the <br/>\nmore bickering happens...I don&#39;t want to feel like the only mom dealing <br/>\nwith this....does anyone have any advice?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I got that impression because you <br/>\nmentioned the more time you spend togehter and the more you get to <br/>\nknow each other.  I am going to assume they had been in school <br/>\nprevious to this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of it may be that they are getting use to each other.  The other <br/>\npart is that they are siblings living together and they are going to <br/>\nget on each others nerves. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just have 3 kids that are 6, 4, & 4.  We get some pretty good <br/>\nbickering going on here too.  When it starts and I am in another <br/>\nroom, I let it be and see if they can work it out for themselves. <br/>\nMany time they can. If it becomes evident it is not getting worked <br/>\nout, I start some activity that I think they will enjoy.  Playdoh, <br/>\npainting, and cooking are good &quot;bring everyone together&quot; activities <br/>\nin our house.  Sometimes it is the &quot;3&#39;s a crowd&quot; dynamic that makes <br/>\nit hard for the kids to get along.  If that is the case, I will try <br/>\nto get my oldest involved in something she loves (jumpstart game or <br/>\nmarkers).  Then I can spend some time playing with or reading to the <br/>\ntwins.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry&quot;?  It has some great advice <br/>\nfor siblings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;mjtjkda&quot; &lt;mjtjkda@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My main energy robber is when my kids start to fight and bicker <br/>\n </span></blockquote>between <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; each other...I have 5 children, 3 of them very close in age and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are constantly going form being &quot;best friends&quot; to hating each <br/>\n </span></blockquote>other...I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; am hearing it go on all day, 24/7 and it makes me really wonder <br/>\n </span></blockquote>what <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sane mother would ever want to stay home and homeschool full time? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; leaves me feeling the need for a nap(which is impossible with 5 <br/>\n </span></blockquote>kids)I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; mean it&#39;s enough to drive even a saint to drink!! lol I feel like <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; more time we spend together and the more we get to know each other, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; more bickering happens...I don&#39;t want to feel like the only mom <br/>\n </span></blockquote>dealing <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; with this....does anyone have any advice?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"&quot;Karen Swanay&quot; &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] energy robber","postDate":"1207259879","msgId":31521,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwNDAzMTQ1N2w1YjI2YTVjOG05MGMyMWM2NjMyM2U1NzA3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ0M2U5bitoaDk2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZ0M2U5bitoaDk2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31514,"nextInTopic":31534,"prevInTime":31520,"nextInTime":31522,"topicId":31514,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have NO advice for you but you are absolutely not alone.
