Judging from your name, you are most likely either Afrikaans or German.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy little boy was born in Sheffield, England and I also lived in Germany and made many trips to the Netherlands.

Of course, I can understand some Afrikaans.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are also very new to UNschooling/homeschooling and I am reading many of the posts to this list and trying to get my head around this subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is it like in Nimibia?
