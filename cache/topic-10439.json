People, especially <br/>\nneighbors who saw him often, gave him the evil eye.  Some of the <br/>\nchildren came right out and told him their parents didn&#39;t like him.  <br/>\nI can&#39;t imagine how painful that was for a 5 yr old to here.  I knew <br/>\nthat getting in trouble all the time was beginning to seriously chip <br/>\naway at his self-esteem.  I myself was starting to wonder though if <br/>\nsomething was really wrong with him.  <br/>\nSo began my quest for info regarding ADHD and what was known and <br/>\nunknown.  <br/>\nA book called the Family Virtues Guide enlightened me.  The author <br/>\nexplained that children that appear to be, for instance bossy, are <br/>\nnatural leaders who need to learn the virtues of patience and <br/>\ncompassion.  I began to wonder if my child had been mislabeled.  I <br/>\ndiscovered that he was not annoying; he was active, energetic & <br/>\nbrilliant. He was behaving normally for him- even thought he didn&#39;t <br/>\nfit societies version of normal.  <br/>\nI also encourage you to see Raising Cane if you haven&#39;t.  I have not <br/>\nseen it yet but have heard that it has helped many parents realize <br/>\nthat there is absolutely nothing wrong with their children. Maybe <br/>\nGrandma might be persuaded to watch it too.  <br/>\nI discovered that in my case, my child&#39;s ADHD related aggression, <br/>\nimpatience & impulsiveness were learned behaviors and that I need to <br/>\nlearn how to model patience, compassion & non-violent communication. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the soda goes, I encourage you to hold off on that if <br/>\npossible.  It might be much more beneficial if he could learn how to <br/>\nhelp himself in a natural way.  I think that once we attach to the <br/>\nthought that something outside ourselves is the answer to our <br/>\nchallenges we begin the never-ending quest for that magic thing to <br/>\nhelp solve our &quot;problems&quot;.  <br/>\nI suggest experimenting with guided imagery (very calming), peaceful <br/>\nmusic, breath control and other mind control techniques. I would <br/>\nmake a game out of it and see what you both can come up with it- <br/>\nsort of a challenge not a problem.  I believe he will feel much <br/>\nbetter, self-esteem wise if he learns that he is brilliant and that <br/>\nonly he can truly help himself.  <br/>\nPeace & Blessings, <br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10426,"nextTopicId":10428}}
