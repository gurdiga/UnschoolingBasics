It is a FUN and funny program that most toddlers can<br/>\ndo easily.  there is matching and song making and other games that are just<br/>\nreally fun to do.  This was Mary Elayne and Keon&#39;s favorite game to play for<br/>\nthe longest time.  Emily even enjoyed it when we first got it.  When it died<br/>\nand we had hunt for the second one, Dan made a copy of it and we kept the<br/>\noriginal safe up on a shelf.  It&#39;s a fun and not nearly as annoying game as<br/>\nsome other games meant for toddlers.  And the bugs are all cute and funny,<br/>\nnot realistic.  The weird thing is that the kids haven&#39;t played it in a long<br/>\ntime but I can still remember some of the songs.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":217204862,"authorName":"Misty Felner","from":"&quot;Misty Felner&quot; &lt;misty@...&gt;","profile":"mistyfelner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"was &quot;used book sale&quot; - Re software","postDate":"1145915639","msgId":12423,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDExNDU3MDU3NDQuNDQwLjg3OTA4Lm0yMEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12431,"prevInTime":12422,"nextInTime":12424,"topicId":12423,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
