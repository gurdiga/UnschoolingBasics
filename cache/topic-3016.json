It is hard to juggle <br/>\nfamily relationships when there is a difference of philosopy/belief  about <br/>\ndiscipline. I had a similar situation with my mom. <br/>\nI listened to what she had to say, and said that while I understood that to <br/>\nher it looked like what I was doing with my children was not normal or what <br/>\nothers do, it is what my husband and I choose to do, and is really very well <br/>\nthought out. I explained very short form about what we believe in, and said if she <br/>\nwanted more info I could supply it. I also said, very kindly, that we will <br/>\nnot be changing what we are doing, and I hoped she could come to terms with <br/>\nthat. It was one of the harder things I have ever had to do, and for a short time <br/>\nthings were a bit awkward, but now I think she respects me for doing what I <br/>\nreally believe in and for doing what I think is the very best thing for my <br/>\nchildren. <br/>\nShe also sees that my kids are great, and I bet  your sister will also. Hard <br/>\nstuff to do tho, I have NEVER asserted myself with my mom before, and it was <br/>\nquite free-ing to  do. <br/>\nJust my experience<br/>\nNancy in BC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":104295661,"authorName":"windmillfamily","from":"&quot;windmillfamily&quot; &lt;amy@...&gt;","profile":"windmillfamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Discipline disagreement w/family","postDate":"1094180361","msgId":3022,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNoOG1tOSs5ZnJxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNoOGU0dStrbXBtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3018,"nextInTopic":3024,"prevInTime":3021,"nextInTime":3023,"topicId":3016,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Reading your original email, I thought your<br/>\nsister was so worked up because he was, like, 12 years old. Isn&#39;t a<br/>\nfour and a half year old sort of feeling out the boundaries of his<br/>\nworld? Like, if I do A, what will happen? Oh, B. &#39;Kay, got it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept of teaching a child &quot;right from wrong,&quot; to me, is one of<br/>\nthe most miserable excuses on record for those people whose idea of<br/>\ndiscipline more or less amounts to yelling and snatching things away -<br/>\nI don&#39;t mean to imply that your sister thinks that way, although it<br/>\nsure is easy to make grand pronouncements about parenting when you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have any yet. ;) I have seen more people than I care to mention<br/>\nberate THREE YEAR OLDS about &quot;right and wrong&quot; - &quot;You know it&#39;s wrong<br/>\nto take his toy! That&#39;s not yours! Tell him you&#39;re sorry!&quot; That&#39;s<br/>\nmeaningless to a child of three! I just think &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; are<br/>\nvery complicated concepts, and it takes a long time and a lot of<br/>\nexperience to truly learn them. Well, anyway, just a thought. It&#39;s<br/>\namazing how, when you stray from the &quot;regular&quot; or mainstream or<br/>\nwhatever path in life, people take it as a cue that they do not have<br/>\nto keep their opinions to themselves. I have no real insight to give<br/>\nyou, just babble; but I hope you&#39;re feeling a little better about the<br/>\nwhole thing. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway, sorry for all the blah blah.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Amy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":108952946,"authorName":"kbb1109","from":"&quot;kbb1109&quot; &lt;karen.kbb@...&gt;","profile":"kbb1109","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Discipline disagreement w/family","postDate":"1094171614","msgId":3018,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNoOGU0dStrbXBtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQxMzdCNUU5LjkwMDAwMDJAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":3017,"nextInTopic":3022,"prevInTime":3017,"nextInTime":3019,"topicId":3016,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m not clear how old Ethan is; my Sam is 4.

I tried in vain to explain our position<br/>\nwhich is gentle discipline/attachment parenting (i didnt use those<br/>\nwords because I would have totally lost her).<br/>\n==========================<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not clear how old Ethan is; my Sam is 4. I can tell you that with my <br/>\nguy a more structured/punitive style of parenting would not work--it <br/>\nwould, in fact, escalate the issues. Have you read _The Explosive Child_ <br/>\nby Ross Greene? It&#39;ll really back you up in what you *know* in you <br/>\nheart. Greene is a PhD, psychologist--use that with your sister. Maybe <br/>\nthe credentialed expert will help back you up and make your point.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat helps with my guy is loving limits and as much freedom as possible. <br/>\nWhen he starts raging (not what Ethan was doing, I know) or becomes <br/>\ndestructive, I often have to physically remove him from the situation <br/>\nbecause he DOES need to know that hitting and destroying isn&#39;t <br/>\nacceptable--your sister&#39;s right about that much. Sam protests, and I <br/>\noften bear the brunt of that. But as he gets older, it is getting <br/>\nbetter. I take him into the bedroom, lay down on the bed with him, hold <br/>\nhim or rub his back and gently explain why I couldn&#39;t let him continue <br/>\nwhat he was doing. And, within short moments, he is usually collapsed in <br/>\ntears and so sorry for the way he handled his emotions. He IS GETTING <br/>\nBETTER at dealing with his strong emotions; he IS NOT escalating with <br/>\nhis behavior, which is what some people predict will happen with this <br/>\nkind of child if you don&#39;t &quot;lay down the law&quot;. Greene&#39;s book is really <br/>\nexcellent on that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis weekend I was away from him for really the first time, and my dh, <br/>\nwho is more *traditional* than I, was with him at his parents&#39; beach <br/>\nhouse. I&#39;m not sure what went on--something in between gentle parenting <br/>\nand spanking, something rough but short of spanking, I&#39;m sure. But...I <br/>\nam now picking up those pieces. Sam keeps lashing out and then saying, <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m a mean guy, aren&#39;t I?&quot; My heart is breaking because these kids are <br/>\nso incredibly sensitive. Yes, they rage, test boundaries, but it cuts <br/>\nthem to the quick--it comes at such a great personal cost in a way <br/>\nthat&#39;s almost compulsive. These kids--if your Ethan is *anything* like <br/>\nmy Sam--need to know that they are loved no matter what and that really <br/>\nseems to be what they&#39;re testing. To keep their selves intact, to keep <br/>\ntheir self-image positive, they look to us, and if the messages that <br/>\nwe&#39;re sending are that they are somehow less than whole, less than <br/>\nhuman, less than kind--well, that just destroys them from the inside out.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, please, please continue to listen to your own instincts. <br/>\nApologize to your sister and assure her that if you were there, you <br/>\nwould have guided Ethan away from hitting the walnuts at her car. Arm <br/>\nher with specific techniques that will improve the situation rather than <br/>\ndisintigrate it further. And, maybe, consider not leaving Ethan alone <br/>\nwith them anymore--I know that&#39;s what I&#39;ve vowed with my Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd...read *anything* you can get your hands on by Anne Ohman, a regular <br/>\nat the now-unavailable Unschooling.com boards.
