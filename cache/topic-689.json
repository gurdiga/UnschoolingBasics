He fits <br/>\nabout 80% of the &quot;highly sensitive&quot; child traits, and lashing out <br/>\nsuddenly or for no apparent reason is one of the issues we&#39;re <br/>\ndealing with right now.<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t always handled it so well....and this week has been <br/>\nespecially difficult, but it&#39;s caused me to step back and assess how <br/>\nwe can better meet his needs to avoid some of the difficulties.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve decided that he needs a LOT of one on one time, more than seems <br/>\nreasonable in a family with four children (I mean, the others need <br/>\nme too) but I have figured out a few things. First of all, I need to <br/>\nBE with him more. He is sometimes happily absorbed in play with his <br/>\nsister and things are fine, but if more than one other person is <br/>\ninvolved in his play there is sure to be problems unless I&#39;m RIGHT <br/>\nthere.<br/>\nDo you notice a sensitivity to overstimulation in your child?<br/>\nI know Jalen just FEEDS on energy, but not always in a good way. <br/>\nWhen there are several children together it&#39;s hard for him to <br/>\nmaintain any kind of control, his emotions cause him to hit, kick, <br/>\nscratch...even when he seems happy. I&#39;ve never had a child like <br/>\nthis, so it&#39;s caught me off guard.<br/>\nI need to be his filter on stimulation, until he&#39;s old enough to <br/>\nfilter it himself, or at least communicate his overstimulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also needs to have protein snacks within reach throughout the <br/>\nday, to help avoid blood sugar fluctuations. I also think that when <br/>\nhe seems happy playing with people, I need to find a good moment to <br/>\nstep in, hug him, re-connect and just remind him that I&#39;m here.<br/>\nHe needs that physical connection, but doesn&#39;t always know how to <br/>\nask for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s also sensitive to certain food additives I think. Mainly red <br/>\n40....<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t go looking for a food problem right off the bat, but <br/>\nsometimes a sensitive person reacts to food more intensely than the <br/>\nrest of us. It&#39;s easy enough for me to keep all the foods he loves <br/>\n(in a healthier version) available, so he doesn&#39;t even notice his <br/>\nfavorite cereal is missing (it&#39;s just a different brand).<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with removing them quickly from any kind of situation that <br/>\ninvolves harming another person.<br/>\nSandra once made a suggestion I&#39;ve used some, and that is to remove <br/>\nthe victim from the situation quickly, and after they&#39;re comforted, <br/>\ngo back and deal with the aggressor. It puts the attention on the <br/>\nvictim first, which is nice when they&#39;re already upset, and it gives <br/>\nthe aggressor a moment of cool off time.<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t always work with a toddler in the midst of a melt-down, <br/>\nbut it can be very useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrevention is my main job right now. With Jalen, it isn&#39;t so easy to <br/>\nsee the triggers though! Today for example, he wanted a pen from my <br/>\npurse. I thought he was going to draw so I handed him the pen and <br/>\nasked if he wanted some paper to draw on...he said &quot;nope&quot; and ran <br/>\ntowards the back of the house. I followed him of course, but by the <br/>\ntime I caught up, he&#39;d run into where Sierra was, stabbed her with <br/>\nthe pen and ran back out laughing as she screamed.<br/>\nA lot of this behavior is a cause and effect thing for him, I&#39;m <br/>\npretty sure. He&#39;s extremely interested in human behavior, plus he <br/>\nhas very little understanding of what it feels like for the other <br/>\nperson. sigh.<br/>\nSo I&#39;m taking this as a wake-up call. I&#39;ve been too distracted <br/>\nlately, and he&#39;s letting me know he needs more of the right kind of <br/>\nstimulation (less neighbor kids over, more one-on-one and <br/>\nkinisthetic/movement oriented activity). <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you noticed that your child does better if you get him out <br/>\nwhere he can move a LOT? I know Jalen is happiest if he can <br/>\nrun/jump/spin/slide etc... so parks, pools and beaches are GREAT! <br/>\nWe bought a large kiddie pool and that is really a fabulous thing <br/>\nfor him. Also, any kind of artsy stuff that he can really get his <br/>\nhands into....clay/playdough, any kind of painting, rice play (we <br/>\nmade a big bin of rice with measuring tools, scoops etc..) water <br/>\nplay, anything tactile.<br/>\nI&#39;m planning to buy some more window pens, so they can decorate the <br/>\nwindows with art. Anything that is remotely messy or touch oriented <br/>\nseems to be great for him. Maybe your guy needs more of that?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some things that have helped me, I totally sympathize, it&#39;s a <br/>\ndifficult thing to deal with all that intense energy sometimes.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8150,"nextTopicId":8179}}
