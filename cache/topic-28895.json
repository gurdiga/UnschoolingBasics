I have 2 daughters at home still, ages (almost) 15 and (just turned) 10. I also have older children who are either married and/or on their own. I was widowed nearly 3 years ago, which was a precedent to my discovery of unschooling and putting in to practice what I knew would be best for my kiddos. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  You sound like you are doing a great job, definitely moving in the &quot;right&quot; direction. <br/>\n  Have fun with your new adventure, and enjoy those kiddos. They grow up way too fast.<br/>\n  Also, I have to say that I love the John Irving quote you used in your signature; it is so true!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ~Wilda and the girls<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle Thedaker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamperedthed@...\">pamperedthed@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Ive been quietly reading here for a week or so and felt it was time to say<br/>\nhi!
