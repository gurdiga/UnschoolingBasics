He goes fishing with my husband, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like fishing is a passion to him. My suggestions would be, <br/>\nask him if he would teach you how to fish, take him to fishing <br/>\nrodeos (we have them here), get online with him and find fishing <br/>\nbooks at Amazon or half.com. In other words, let him know that you <br/>\ntake his fishing passion seriously and that you&#39;re willing to do <br/>\nwhatever it takes to help him pursue the fishing. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe fishing will become a lifestyle for him, maybe fishing is his <br/>\nescape, maybe he just loves the quietness of fishing ( LOTS of <br/>\nthinking goes on when a person is fishing), maybe he&#39;ll someday <br/>\ncreate a television show around his fishing technique or maybe he&#39;ll <br/>\nimmerse himself totally into fishing and it&#39;ll lead to something <br/>\nelse. No way to know just yet. <br/>\n<br/>\nWould you learn how to handle the boat so that the two of you could <br/>\ngo off together and fish? What an incredibly spiritual adventure <br/>\nthat could be. Mom and Jon fishing quietly on the water. Sounds <br/>\nheavenly to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about hosting a fishing party for Jon and one or two of his <br/>\nfriends? My dad took me and 5 other teenage girls crabbing from his <br/>\nboat one time. It&#39;s one of my fondest childhood memories. And he <br/>\nreally shone with patience. Imagine SIX teen girls in a boat in the <br/>\nmiddle of the water! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are so many ways to fish, so many different types of fish <br/>\nto catch. Fishing from the boat, the shore, deepsea fishing, etc. My <br/>\ndad has a million passions, but fishing is number one with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of looking for things that you might feel he SHOULD have a <br/>\npassion about, go with the one he already has. Fishing is an art and <br/>\nif more teen boys could sit still long enough to fish, they&#39;d <br/>\nprobably be a lot more content. It&#39;s a physical and cerebral <br/>\nactivity.<br/>\n<br/>\nlove, Valerie<br/>\nwww.ubpub.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154033277,"authorName":"Crystal","from":"&quot;Crystal&quot; &lt;crystal.pina@...&gt;","profile":"crystalinma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 155","postDate":"1092921721","msgId":2854,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNnMjlocCtkMTc5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU5Ni00MTI0QTVEOC0yMzUxQHN0b3JlZnVsbC0zMTU0LmJheS53ZWJ0di5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":2853,"nextInTopic":2857,"prevInTime":2853,"nextInTime":2855,"topicId":2853,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Michelle, Why don t you think that fishing is a passion?

He has a hard time tryng<br/>\nanything because he predetermines his failure at it, so why bother<br/>\ntrying. <br/>\nWe gently encourage him to try something he may like. We encourage him<br/>\nto take one small step. I do agree that he is in angst. We talk about<br/>\nthat. He is seeking to fit in to &quot;make it all better.&quot; The only trouble<br/>\nwith that is that change comes from the inside. That is the tricky part.<br/>\nSometimes it seems like he gets stuck in the blame game. It seems he is<br/>\nstuck taking it out on me because he trusts me and I am handy.
