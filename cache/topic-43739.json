They were intrigued  and skeptical. &lt;g&gt;    If he did anything they didn&#39;t like they&#39;d tell him that his mom and dad should spank him.   So, I&#39;d suspect a play group where he&#39;s hearing from other kids.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it possible he&#39;s having problems with some kid in a play group again?  Some kid who&#39;s not liking something your son is doing and is telling him he ought to get smacked?   Maybe find something better to do on play group days, go someplace different for awhile and see if anything changes.  Just a thought. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought is that if he&#39;s trying to control an impulse to hit he&#39;s considering the general morality of hitting.  Hitting someone who doesn&#39;t hit you is pretty bad.  Hitting someone who hits you is less bad, etc.    If he&#39;s feeling like he wants to hit someone, maybe pay attention to see if you can notice what might be frustrating him.  It&#39;s hard to be little.   Look for things that might be frustrating him and see if you can ease it some.  Play with him more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy other thought is that he&#39;s being funny.   We don&#39;t hit, we never hit Dylan, we never hit each other, we don&#39;t smack our friends, but we joke about doing bodily harm. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think Joyce had a good idea of bringing humor to the situation.   Next time he says you should smack him you could say something like, &quot;Well if we were a hitting family, I wouldn&#39;t just smack you, I&#39;d slap you out from between your ears.&quot;  (Johnny Eager)  Or something similar and silly and exaggerated.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if he is enjoying to possibility of physical humor there&#39;s The Three Stooges with lots of smacking, slapping, tweaking, etc.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Son is totally confusing me, help???","postDate":"1271928262","msgId":43744,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMxMjI1Rjk4LURERjctNEZBRS05REE0LUM1MDM5N0VCMUFEQUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG9wLnZiamM2MWJxOXZxMHUzQHlvdXItcTk0Ymp2dGwwcj4=","referencesHeader":"PG9wLnZiamM2MWJxOXZxMHUzQHlvdXItcTk0Ymp2dGwwcj4="},"prevInTopic":43743,"nextInTopic":43748,"prevInTime":43743,"nextInTime":43745,"topicId":43739,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I can&#39;t remember what he did but he came out with &quot;You really should spank me for that!&quot; We had never done anything of the sort!! Have no idea where it came from...except maybe something he saw in a video...he had been watching the OLD looney toons cartoons. There is a lot of hitting going on there. Maybe just a stage???<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Wed, 4/21/10, Paul & Camille &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:morlingfamily@...\">morlingfamily@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Paul & Camille &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:morlingfamily@...\">morlingfamily@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Son is totally confusing me, help???<br/>\nTo: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, April 21, 2010, 7:36 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell my ds is just turned 6 and confusing me is an understatement.
