He went over to the back of the room and played with the table<br/>\nset toys for kids. I was ready to go because one twin was hungry and<br/>\nwanted to eat. A gentle reminder to all... then I was left waiting at<br/>\nthe door with one twin. I went back again to remind him and the other<br/>\ntwin, but DS stayed while the rest of us stood at the door. We<br/>\nFINALLY got to the van but DS lagged back, pushing at the handicapped<br/>\ndoor button. I went back once again but he refused to look at me or<br/>\nstop pushing at the button. I had to push him away gently to look at<br/>\nme (remember we depend on eye contact to sign and communicate) and get<br/>\nhim to stop pushing the button. He kept coming back at it before<br/>\nrunning to the van. I explained when he finally looked at me that<br/>\nthe button is for people who are in a wheelchair or have crutches. If<br/>\nkids play with it all the time they might take out that button or put<br/>\nup an ugly sign that says Parents, please do not allow your children<br/>\nto play with the HC button...<br/>\n<br/>\nDS can be intense sometimes. He has an acute sense of unfairness to<br/>\nhimself, never mind how &quot;fair&quot; others are being. He can stomp off if<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t get what he wants right now. I am understanding (or trying<br/>\nto in my n00b stage) but when he&#39;s got his brothers in a headlock or<br/>\nwhen his younger twin brothers are stomping around and pouting like<br/>\nhim, I&#39;m worried.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the aforementioned situation, I made quite some mistakes. I<br/>\nshould have not loaned him the money in the first place, instead have<br/>\nworked out him going to get a gift card that he could use to spend<br/>\nonline on what he wanted with his allowance. I am not sure what to do<br/>\nwhen he gets into intense mode. With the stomping and pouting, I<br/>\nignore him (I have given him hugs in the past but it seemed to make<br/>\nthe episodes worse and plus I put myself in danger of being hit.).<br/>\nBut when he refuses to stop something like push the handicapped door<br/>\nbutton or leave the TV remote alone when it&#39;s time to go, I&#39;m afraid<br/>\nit might lead to bigger things like refusing to stop putting his<br/>\nbrother in a headlock or something.
