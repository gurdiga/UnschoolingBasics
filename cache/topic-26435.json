You didn&#39;t fail to show up on purpose, and you<br/>\napologized for your mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s more, the baby isn&#39;t going to remember the party itself, much less<br/>\nwhether or not you showed up. It seems that your friend needs to develop a<br/>\nthicker skin in dealing with situations like this. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost moms realize that having a family is a ton of work, and we as moms are<br/>\nall constantly juggling a thousand different commitments. Sometimes, a thing<br/>\nor two will get lost in the shuffle, but that&#39;s just life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t really offer any specific advice. You know your friend best, so you<br/>\nprobably know the best way to approach her about it. The main thing is,<br/>\ndon&#39;t beat yourself up about it, and don&#39;t feel like you have to apologize<br/>\nover and over again for the next 20 years.
