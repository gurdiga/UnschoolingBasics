I have decided that I am going to try and not let this bother me. I have a good relationship with my daughter and I know what she is up to and where she is at all times, unlike this girl and her father. In fact, I know  where his kid is pretty much all the  time which is something I cannot say for him. I find it reprehensible that this Dad is using my daughter as some kind of central theme in his custody battle. He is blaming her for decisions his own daughter ultimately makes on her own.  Also, he invaded the privacy of a minor for crying out loud. He has a terrible relationship with her, and won&#39;t accept responsibility for the fact that its his fault.  I just hate being dragged into someone else&#39;s quagmire, and its having an affect on my daughter, which angers me to no end. I can&#39;t wait until she heads off to NBTSC and hangs out with other unschoolers.
