I was lucky<br/>\nnot to have that problem.  Because I resisted the rule orientation I<br/>\ngrew up under, I looked for something else.  I gathered my ideas from<br/>\nall over, mostly reading.  Rules might work as long as there are &quot;well<br/>\ntravelled roads&quot; and no need for a &quot;compass&quot; to guide to the next<br/>\nstep.

It&#39;s about living our lives  <br/>\ntogether within the framework of values *and* freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can share our values without imposing them.

But they can&#39;t truly think  <br/>\nand understand if we don&#39;t give them the freedom to think &quot;wrong&quot;  <br/>\nthoughts. Art critics don&#39;t come to understand what good art is by  <br/>\nmemorizing some expert&#39;s idea of what is &quot;good art&quot; They come to  <br/>\nunderstand by being free to embrace all art and come to their own  <br/>\nunderstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never told my daughter not to shoot someone.

What they basically said was &quot;gifted&quot; children learn when<br/>\nthey&#39;re ready.   That&#39;s natural learning and all people learn when<br/>\nthey&#39;re ready and not one minute before.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think when a parent doesn&#39;t really know how to live easily with a kid<br/>\nit&#39;s comforting to say that child is gifted because it lets the parent<br/>\noff the hook.

A lot of what is considered normal on TV is forbidden (to watch or<br/>\ndo) in our religion.  I watched a close relative allow their children<br/>\nto watch mainstream TV without supervision or restriction and I see<br/>\nwhat the results have been.  I want to limit the possibility of them<br/>\nbecoming numb to certain images that are normal on TV and forbidden<br/>\nfor us.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children watch mainstream TV without restriction with great results. <br/>\nHow do you explain this?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  My kids are gifted, my son is probably profoundly gifted, which<br/>\nmeans that he can understand everything he sees but he lacks the<br/>\nmaturity to process it emotionally.  This was proven when we watched a<br/>\nshow on a genius sperm bank (I did not explain anything).  A few weeks<br/>\nlater, my daughter asked some question about having a baby and I told<br/>\nher (because she was 5) that she had to be married first.  My son<br/>\nresponded that no she didn&#39;t, she could use the sperm bank.  There you<br/>\ngo.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll advise you to dump the gifted label.<br/>\nBut I think your son managed to process it emotionally just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe called you on your bald-faced lie. Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t have <br/>\nenough information. She doesn&#39;t have to use just a sperm bank. All she <br/>\nneeds to do is to have unprotected (and occasionally, even protected!) <br/>\nsex.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou made another mistake by not explaining anything about sperm banks <br/>\nin the first place! You were right *there* and didn&#39;t even explain <br/>\nanything?????<br/>\n<br/>\nThere you go!<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t think that a young child won&#39;t remember and take to heart what <br/>\nshe hears. When I was 7 (my brother was 6), my brother had read a <br/>\nbutton that read, &quot;FUCK.&quot; He asked my mother what that meant. She said, <br/>\nafter gulping hard---I remember *that* too---&quot;That&#39;s the hippie word <br/>\nfor having a baby.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, at seven, I thought that, if someone said, &quot;she&#39;s fucked,&quot; she was <br/>\npregnant. I thought that for *years*! Because my MOTHER said so.<br/>\n<br/>\nLying puts the brakes on trust. If she finds out you&#39;ve lied about <br/>\n*that*, what else could you have lied about?<br/>\n<br/>\nNot worth it!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  I don&#39;t intend to keep them locked up and naive about the<br/>\nrealities of life, I would just prefer to limit their prominence at<br/>\nthis point.  They are only 6 and 8.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat may not be your intention. But how do you think they will process <br/>\nthat information you&#39;ve given them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey *will* lose trust in you if you keep lying to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer NOT to lose that trust!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the message of creativity is bad because it is messy - hey we<br/>\nall have our faults right?  At least I&#39;m owning up to mine and giving<br/>\nthem an option.

They are still saddened by<br/>\nsomeone dying and blush when they see people making out in public despite<br/>\nseeing mass mayhem and makeout scenes on television.

I am a reader so when I heard a panel of parents and then a second panel of children speak on unschooling I began my research and at the same time because of my and my husband faith and believe in the bible I had to find the fit for me where I did not feel that my convictions and beliefs were not compromised.  So again I was on a search spiritually this time to see how I could unschool and be true to my beliiefs and what I found out is that when my husband and I choose to follow the path spiritually it was our choice but we were able to make that choice based on what we saw in others at our church what we heard read and studied and that is what I want my children<br/>\n to be able to do so as it realtes to T.V. when my children watch things that I may not agree with or hear things or learn things that go against our beliefs It is an opportunity for me to have a conversation with them let them know what their oarents believe ands why and then let them know that they to have ot make a choice of lwhat they want to believe we talk about how seeing that or hearing that makes them feel and it becomes one of the best opportunity for me to share with my children that a book or  curriculum never could.
