Treat your weekdays like weekends; no structure, no lessons, no books. Start there. Over time, read some more about &quot;deschooling&quot;, which stresses the importance of being patient during the transition away from teaching and curriculum. It is critical that kids be allowed a period (sometimes long, sometimes not&quot; during which to adjust to this new freedom, because the change is a pretty dramatic one. Use this time to reconnect with your children - ask them questions about what they&#39;re doing with no expectation that they&#39;re &quot;learning&quot; something. If they want to spend their day watching Pokemon, then learn about Pokemon so you have easy ways to connect with them. If they want to read bout karate, then read about karate with them and celebrate their passion and interest. IMO, this first stage is all about giving your children the gift of your faith in them and<br/>\n your affirmation that they can explore their passions. Simply concentrate on letting go and engaging in the fun that they will have. Read more deeply about unschooling as a lifestyle, about letting go, about trust, about TV and chores and food choices and allowances and messiness. And most importantly, trust - just rust - that if you an really let go of the concept that &quot;kids need to be taught in order to learn&quot;, that you will be giving your kids a gift with eternal benefits. Best wishes - have fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Thu, 4/30/09, jlejmr98 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jlejmr98@...\">jlejmr98@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: jlejmr98 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jlejmr98@...\">jlejmr98@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] How?<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, April 30, 2009, 11:40 PM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     <br/>\n&gt;             <br/>\n&gt;             <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       <br/>\n&gt;       I sit here, without sleep wondering why something<br/>\n&gt; that seems so simple can feel so complicated.

Just let it go. Get a box and pack all of the curriculum stuff into it and wrap it with twine and mark do not open until the September and shove it in the attic or in the back of a closet or in the garage and leave it there. Go to the zoo, go to the park, go to a really cool science museum, go to a costume shop, go to a thrift store, go to friends, have friends over, go get a new video game, get new music, go to a new restaurant, go to an old favorite place, do something different and fun and exciting or something the same and fun and exciting. Don&#39;t look for learning, just do it. Don&#39;t wait for them to ask to do workbooks or to memorize all the name of the presidents or kings and queens or major tributaries of the Amazon river, go play. At 8, 6, 3, and 1 play should be the major activity in any given day. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen September comes go look at the box and think about all those moments you would have missed if you&#39;d kept those papers, those things to do, those busying moments to hand and change the date, put it off for another 6 months, write do not open &#39;til February on the box and keep playing and doing and being. You can always change your mind, you can always go back to where you were before, but once you&#39;ve been this side of the bridge, the other side just doesn&#39;t look so good. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: jlejmr98 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jlejmr98@...\">jlejmr98@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nT<br/>\nI sit here, without sleep wondering why something that seems so simple can feel so complicated.
