What does she miss? It may be those are things you can help her have more of at home. If she&#39;s missing friends, invite more people over.

Generally speaking, that&#39;s not too difficult - kind of like saying &quot;more interesting than waiting in line at the DMV&quot; or &quot;less stressful than a day in court&quot; ;) When kids miss school, most often they miss the company of lots of other people. If you&#39;re daughter is naturally social in that way, it will be more work for you, getting her out and about, finding her places and ways she can be social that work for her. Enlist all the friends and relatives you can in that regard. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso your daughter may be worried that she&#39;s somehow now expected to &quot;teach herself what she needs to know&quot; - that was a concern of Ray&#39;s when we brought him home from school and it helped him to know that Wasn&#39;t what we expected. I don&#39;t recommend trying to explain unschooling to younger kids, but older kids often need some reassurance after years of hearing how they Have To go to school that you&#39;re not just giving up on them or expecting them to &quot;naturally&quot; start doing math problems and writing history reports on their own. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Educational Neglect","postDate":"1331496792","msgId":48042,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpqajEwbys1ajdoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzE0ODY3MjYuMjcyNDkuWWFob29NYWlsQ2xhc3NpY0B3ZWIxNjIyMDYubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48041,"nextInTopic":48043,"prevInTime":48041,"nextInTime":48043,"topicId":48028,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ***************** There s a lot of it depends and know thyself in the answer to this question.

As long as you can be calm and confident that they&#39;ll learn them, it&#39;s not likely to cause more than a ripple.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I don&#39;t want my kids to feel that they should hide how they live.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But they can choose how the present how they live depending on who they&#39;re talking to.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can coach them. Come up with some ideas together. Like, &quot;Hey, can we think of some things you guys do that will sound like learning to other people? I think telling them you play video games all day confuses them since most adults don&#39;t understand how much learning there is in games.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":48417086,"authorName":"Melissa Kruger","from":"Melissa Kruger &lt;ubertulip@...&gt;","profile":"ubertulip","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Educational Neglect","postDate":"1331341099","msgId":48029,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzEzNDEwOTkuMjMzNzMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjExMDQwMS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":48028,"nextInTopic":48031,"prevInTime":48028,"nextInTime":48030,"topicId":48028,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I wonder if I should document in some way what we re doing around here.

Built the Eiffel Tower in Minecraft.&quot;  If you ever need to <br/>\ntranslate that into schoolish language, you could, but otherwise you can<br/>\n just enjoy the remarkable record of life and learning unfolding.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people use Evernote, some people use computer entries, some people use <br/>\nshort entries in a planner that has a generous space next to each <br/>\nweekday.  These planners work perfectly for me: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.blueskyimg.com/\">http://www.blueskyimg.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n--Melissa K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":321860186,"authorName":"Sara Uselton","from":"&quot;Sara Uselton&quot; &lt;saralouwho@...&gt;","profile":"reflectionmommy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Educational Neglect","postDate":"1331338421","msgId":48028,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpqZTZibCttNXM3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48029,"prevInTime":48027,"nextInTime":48029,"topicId":48028,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That term strikes some small measure of fear in me.

I mostly don&#39;t worry about what the rest of society thinks of my lifestyle, but sometimes I get on worry tangents.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI worry that someone will find out how we homeschool---that we unschool-- and then I&#39;ll have to start answering to someone from child services.  I don&#39;t really talk about how we do things to other people.  When someone asks about curriculum, I just say that we develop our own curriculum.  I&#39;m aware that leaves them with a different impression from what we actually do, which I&#39;m fine with.  But I don&#39;t want my kids to feel that they should hide how they live.  My kids are very outgoing, and my oldest will just tell people randomly, &quot;I get to play video games all day!&quot;  And it worries me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike all kids, my kids seem very advanced in some areas, and less advanced in others.  For instance, my ds7 has an incredibly large vocabulary, and a lot of trivia knowledge about a broad range of things.  He&#39;s extremely witty and creative.  He creates these extravagant games and stories in his mind, which he plays out independently.  On the other hand, he can&#39;t quite count to 30 (He skips either 13 or 14 every time.) He really just doesn&#39;t seem to have an interest in numbers right now, and he doesn&#39;t know the days of the week.  I worry about how we would be judged, if we were approached by someone in the government.     <br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if I should document in some way what we&#39;re doing around here.  I know a lady who, for every day that it&#39;s appropriate, just looked at the things her kids did that day, and documented the &quot;subjects&quot; that best fit them.  Like listing math, social studies, science, etc.  Sometimes I think I should do something like that, but I feel a great resistance to it.  I feel that the more I try to look at my kid&#39;s activities in a schooly way, the more stressed I feel.  When I just enjoy my time with my kids, and explore their and my interests, that&#39;s when our lives feel most joyful and harmonious.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is, does anybody else have these worries?  How do you address them?  I would appreciate any help in putting these things in perspective.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much in advance.<br/>\nSara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47990,"nextTopicId":48012}}
