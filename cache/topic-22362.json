Places like Harvard University  <br/>\nget so many &quot;top&quot; students who&#39;ve gone through the exact same process  <br/>\nas each other, won the same top honors, performed the same  <br/>\noutstanding service projects that they don&#39;t distinguish themselves.  <br/>\nBut unschoolers have had unique experiences. Unschoolers who apply  <br/>\nhave shown a lot of personal drive in the direction of their  <br/>\ninterests. They haven&#39;t followed the paths laid out by others.  <br/>\nThey&#39;ve carved unique paths for themselves. They stand out :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lesser colleges and the state colleges who don&#39;t get many  <br/>\nunschooling applicants often don&#39;t know what to do with their  <br/>\napplications ;-) The colleges are looking for the standard hoops that  <br/>\napplicants have jumped through so they can sort the applications into  <br/>\n&quot;college material&quot; and &quot;not college material&quot;. So those colleges tend  <br/>\nto want to see the same old standard proof that they&#39;re used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers can educate them :-) They can help them see the value of  <br/>\na unique life and education. With the top tier universities and  <br/>\ncolleges, unschoolers don&#39;t have to. It&#39;s already been done for them  <br/>\nby unschoolers years and years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something Deb Cunefare posted a bit ago about unschoolers and  <br/>\ncollege. You probably saw it but it&#39;s worth repeating :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Allison McKee&#39;s book &quot;From Homeschool to College and Work&quot; details  <br/>\n&gt; how she<br/>\n&gt; translated her son&#39;s unschooling experiences into transcripts when  <br/>\n&gt; he decided at<br/>\n&gt; the last minute to go to college instead of pursuing a career as a  <br/>\n&gt; fishing<br/>\n&gt; guide at Yellowstone. Guaranteed to help see that teens don&#39;t need  <br/>\n&gt; to &quot;pursue<br/>\n&gt; academics&quot; to go to college, and helpful for parents trying to pull  <br/>\n&gt; together<br/>\n&gt; transcripts from an authentic life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wes Beach&#39;s book &quot;Opportunities After High School: Thoughts,  <br/>\n&gt; Documents,<br/>\n&gt; Resources&quot; has sample transcripts written in a wide variety of  <br/>\n&gt; styles granting<br/>\n&gt; credit for a vast range of real life learning. Some of the  <br/>\n&gt; information is specific<br/>\n&gt; to CA but most is easily adapted to teens living anywhere. The book is<br/>\n&gt; available from the Homeschool Association of California www.hsc.org<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t let the transcript/diploma ride the child. Help him live an  <br/>\n&gt; authentic<br/>\n&gt; life, in passionate pursuit of his interests, and then if he wants  <br/>\n&gt; to go to<br/>\n&gt; college help him translate that life into terms the colleges can  <br/>\n&gt; understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":285320662,"authorName":"Johanna","from":"Johanna &lt;dialog@...&gt;","profile":"solelokua","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"University","postDate":"1174435201","msgId":22362,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ5OEU0QzkyLUYyNjItNDBEQy1COTJFLTgxQzcxNjBCQzY1RkB1bmVyem9nZW4uZGU+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22366,"prevInTime":22361,"nextInTime":22363,"topicId":22362,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello :-) I have heard that University specifically look for unschoolers, because they learn better.
