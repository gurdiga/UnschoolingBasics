I wish I no longer had to deal with my MIL but she lives in my house!   My children wish she&#39;d hurry up and die which upsets my spouse as she&#39;s his mother.  She never says please nor thank-you.  The other day she threatened my step-daughter over a microwavable meal my step-daughter was eating.  I lost it.  Thank goodness my spouse backed me up.  My step-daughter asked to go back to her mother&#39;s to get away from the witch.  My spouse told his mother (again) if she can not treat her grandchildren better, then she will have to find somewhere else to live.  He tries to sooth it over by reminding us she had a stroke.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  In my opinion, and years of experience, you can&#39;t change them unless they want to change.  I kept trying with my parents for years.  I finally gave up and found I was much happier without their nastiness. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I take a life lesson out of this and look for grandparents whom are loved by their grandchildren.  I am taking notes so I can emulate them when it&#39;s my turn to be a grandparent.  Nothing, not even a chair nor microwavable meal, is worth chasing MY future grandchildren from my life.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Good luck to you.<br/>\n  Vicki<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

They are dismissive and<br/>\nalways cutting them down.  Because of this we haven&#39;t seen them in<br/>\nover a year.  It is far easier to just not see them than to deal with<br/>\ntheir anger, disrespect, putdowns, and guilt! (My grandmother is the<br/>\nQueen of Guilt!)<br/>\n<br/>\n We also have distanced ourselves from Dan&#39;s mother for many of the<br/>\nsame reasons.  It isn&#39;t something we did lightly either.   She had no<br/>\nway of contacting us for over 3 years.  We mourn that we don&#39;t have<br/>\n&quot;normal&quot; accepting respectful family members.  However, we refuse to<br/>\nlet those family members make us feel poorly about our choices.  We<br/>\nrefuse to submit our children to their toxicity just so that they can<br/>\nhave a relationship with their grandparents and other relatives.  We<br/>\nhave a &quot;created family&quot; which we built from friends who respect us.<br/>\n&quot;Aunts and uncles&quot; who understand (or at least respect) our family<br/>\nchoices.  One of my friends (who would have been a fantastic<br/>\nunschooler except she sent her children to school - their all grown<br/>\nnow) even stretched a piece of painter&#39;s tape down her living room for<br/>\none of my kids to do cartwheels on so she could practice doing them on<br/>\na balance beam!!  That&#39;s something that my family (including my own<br/>\nmom) would *never* do!!

You also might send them <br/>\nanecdotes of how your kids are thriving so they can begin to see them <br/>\nas you do, and they can begin to see that your way is &quot;working&quot; for <br/>\nyou and your kids.

To help them understand why I am so different with <br/>\nLiam than they were with me (and even than my brother and sister are <br/>\nwith their kids), I passed on a lot of reading material and lots of <br/>\nanecdotes.

Im pretty low key and put up with alot from my  inlaws  <br/>\nbut they just make remarks to me when the kids are not around.....  I know this <br/>\nsounds really harsh but if this were me  id not be going  back  and when they <br/>\ncall asking why Id nicely (cause why sink to their  level) say that wed be <br/>\nback when they could respect my children and my  choices and that id never put <br/>\nmy child into a situation where the threat of  being *beat* was even thought <br/>\nof.  IMO your mil saying If they do it again  I will beat them is saying just <br/>\nthat  so if you return without this being  adressed in a way where they know <br/>\nthis isnt an option, you are silently enabling  them to follow through.  Good <br/>\nluck family is never easy to deal with!

Today my MIL ordered (she didn&#39;t ask or say please - lol - so <br/>\nI don&#39;t know another word) my oldest daughter to get her a folding <br/>\nchair.  She doesn&#39;t get around very well and there were 5 other <br/>\nadults there she could have asked for help.  Yet she kept raising <br/>\nher voice and demanding my daughter to help her.  When my daughter <br/>\nsaid &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to help I want to play&quot; (with her cousins <br/>\nthat were also visiting) She screamed at her, calling her lazy, a <br/>\nbad grandaughter, etc.  I told her as nicely as a could that my <br/>\ndaughter is free to choose whether or not she wants to help and she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t appreciate being ordered or demanded.  She then proceeded to <br/>\ntell me that if she ever did that again she would beat her.  I told <br/>\nher she would never lay a hand on my children.  She told me that <br/>\nsomeone had to beat some respect into my children.  We continued to <br/>\nloudly discuss - me pointing out that my children can choose whether <br/>\nor not to help - and she kept saying no - she should do what&#39;s she <br/>\ntold.  Then to top it all off - her grandfather (whom was angry that <br/>\nI defended my child) allowed the other grandchildren (the cousins) <br/>\nto ride on the 4-wheeler with their mom, but not mine, since they <br/>\nwere disrespectful to his wife.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did raise my voice at her and probably pushed it a bit too far, <br/>\nbut do you have any other suggestions on how to handle a situation <br/>\nlike this if it ever comes up again?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey truly don&#39;t get that children should be able to decide whether <br/>\nor not they want to help.  They talk to my neice and nephews and <br/>\nbark orders at them and expect them to jump to it.
