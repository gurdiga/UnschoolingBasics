It doesn&#39;t eliminate them.  If high-status guests<br/>\nwanted to be rowdy in the pool at 3am, the staff would not necessarily run<br/>\nthem out unless they get complaints from other guests.  And even then, a<br/>\n&quot;shhhhhh.you&#39;re bothering other guests&quot; is more likely as a first response<br/>\nin that situation.

Sometimes I ask<br/>\nthe desk at check-in, &quot;Are the hours on the pool strict, or will my keycard<br/>\nstill work at midnight?&quot;.  Sometimes I call from my room on the way down to<br/>\nthe pool.  But not always.  There was one hotel who said the hours were<br/>\nstrict simply because the pool was in an open atrium area with 50 rooms<br/>\nsurrounding it on 3 floors, and even a normal voice conversation would carry<br/>\nand bother guests.   When I told them I just wanted to relax quietly in the<br/>\nhot tub alone, and would not be talking to myself, they said it was OK.

If my child breaks a plastic step climbing up the slide at<br/>\nthe county pool, am I expected to write them a check to pay for it?<br/>\nAren&#39;t that what my taxes are for? I&#39;m going to tell someone it<br/>\nhappened and check to make sure my child is okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf something is broke during the day - if you sit on a lounge chair<br/>\nand the leg falls off - are you going to offer to pay for it? Do we<br/>\nstop to concern ourselves with the hotel&#39;s potential liability and<br/>\nincreased insurance fees if we have an accident while visiting the<br/>\npool after breakfast? These aren&#39;t questions we really consider before<br/>\nentering the pool during regular hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the hotel pools I&#39;ve visited, there is no lifeguard on duty during<br/>\n&quot;open&quot; hours and there is no other safety feature in place during the<br/>\nday that makes a night swim less safe. One could argue that light is a<br/>\nfactor and that makes it riskier. However, at most hotels the pools<br/>\nare lit up all night and even if they aren&#39;t directly lit by<br/>\nunderwater lights, there are always light sources nearby, so even that<br/>\nisn&#39;t much different. In most cases, a sign saying &quot;closed&quot; or &quot;open&quot;<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t cause a corresponding change to the physical environment of<br/>\nthe pool and it doesn&#39;t create or remove safety risks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve asked sweetly and have been given permission to use the pool in<br/>\nthe middle of the night at several hotels, as long as we aren&#39;t loud<br/>\nor disruptive. That&#39;s the main concern of the hotel staff.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- You could get arrested.  And depending on how uptight your state<br/>\nis. Children&#39;s services  could be brought in.  Maybe some are willing<br/>\nto accept those risks. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess hypothetically that could happen - heck anything could<br/>\n*potentially* happen, maybe, but it&#39;s highly unlikely and I think<br/>\nthere would have to be more to the situation than just a family at a<br/>\nnew playground or swimming late in a hotel pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I&#39;m not saying that everyone should make the same decision in<br/>\nthis situation, or that&#39;s our decision is an incredibly wise choice,<br/>\nor that there aren&#39;t any risks involved, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s<br/>\nhelpful to act upon or make decisions based on something that is<br/>\nextremely improbable. I&#39;ve found that fear gets in the way of clear<br/>\nthinking more often than not, but maybe I&#39;m just more of a rebel than<br/>\nI thought, I don&#39;t know.

There are<br/>\n&gt; rules<br/>\n&gt; that the pool posts and operates on. There are lifeguards present. The<br/>\n&gt; other<br/>\n&gt; day we were all jumping into the deep end and swimming to the side and<br/>\n&gt; getting out. I got the whistle blown at me. I didn&#39;t know why so I asked.<br/>\n&gt; The lifeguard explained that cannonballs weren&#39;t allowed, I had pulled my<br/>\n&gt; legs up slightly, which produced a wonderful splash. But that didn&#39;t mean<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t keep jumping in. If I&#39;d assumed that they were whistling at the<br/>\n&gt; jumping I could have chosen to stop Simon and Linnaea and David from<br/>\n&gt; jumping. I was nervous about jumping from the side of the pool to begin<br/>\n&gt; with, I thought, even though it wasn&#39;t labelled on the many don&#39;ts board,<br/>\n&gt; that maybe jumping into the deep end, particularly with Linnaea not being<br/>\n&gt; the strongest of swimmers, that it might be out of bounds. But it wasn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; The only thing we did wrong that whole 30 minutes or so of joyfully<br/>\n&gt; jumping<br/>\n&gt; in the pool was that I made a big, big splash.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is funny the things that can make you nervous. You write &quot; I told my<br/>\n&gt; husband that I simply thought it was respectful not to use the playground<br/>\n&gt; until it was ready, after all none the other kids at the park were able<br/>\n&gt; to,<br/>\n&gt; because their parents wouldn&#39;t let them.&quot; But someone could use that<br/>\n&gt; argument to not unschool. I&#39;ve thought about that when I watch Simon&#39;s or<br/>\n&gt; Linnaea&#39;s friends envying aspects of our lives, asking me to talk to their<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; mom to see if they could have or do what we do. I know that just by living<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; as we live I am making their lives more difficult because our lives<br/>\n&gt; underscore the lies that their parents tell them. I know that the children<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; whose parents pull them away from playing in the rain water underneath the<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ancient guardhouse latrine at Barnard Castle while Simon and Linnaea wade,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; giggle and splash will only know that they aren&#39;t allowed to do what mine<br/>\n&gt; can freely and happily do.And maybe they&#39;ll come up with justifications,<br/>\n&gt; maybe they&#39;ll make it better in their minds by saying that my children are<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wild or yobbish (the UK&#39;s white trash) or not as smart or as well<br/>\n&gt; educated,<br/>\n&gt; and I won&#39;t stop them, but that&#39;s a lie as well. And that doesn&#39;t make it<br/>\n&gt; alright for me to make Simon&#39;s or Linnaea&#39;s life smaller. My children are<br/>\n&gt; not models of how to have a structured and by the rules kind of life. The<br/>\n&gt; funny thing, though, is that we are very good at following the rules. The<br/>\n&gt; other day, when we were in London getting Simon&#39;s passport renewed, there<br/>\n&gt; was a rule we were choosing to follow. I can&#39;t remember what it was. I<br/>\n&gt; really can&#39;t remember, but it led to a discussion about following rules<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; how, because we don&#39;t have rules in our own lives, we follow the rules<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; others set pretty well. It seems, however falsely, that if there is a rule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; it must be for a reason, and unless the reason is ludicrous, we tend to<br/>\n&gt; respect the rule. That doesn&#39;t mean we mindlessly follow, but it means<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; Simon and Linnaea are more likely to follow a rule than are their more<br/>\n&gt; rulebound peers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, I would have swung and played and laughed and enjoyed the moment of<br/>\n&gt; having the new park all to ourselves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Schuyler<br/>\n&gt; www.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wondering how some of you would of handled this...would you of played<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at the park, or no?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kendrah :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!

I imagine if someone came along <br/>\nand asked you to leave, that after complaining about the advertised <br/>\ncompletion date, you and yours would have left.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go swimming every Thursday with a group of homeschoolers. There are rules <br/>\nthat the pool posts and operates on. There are lifeguards present. The other<br/>\nday we were all jumping into the deep end and swimming to the side and <br/>\ngetting out. I got the whistle blown at me. I didn&#39;t know why so I asked. <br/>\nThe lifeguard explained that cannonballs weren&#39;t allowed, I had pulled my <br/>\nlegs up slightly, which produced a wonderful splash. But that didn&#39;t mean I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t keep jumping in. If I&#39;d assumed that they were whistling at the <br/>\njumping I could have chosen to stop Simon and Linnaea and David from <br/>\njumping. I was nervous about jumping from the side of the pool to begin <br/>\nwith, I thought, even though it wasn&#39;t labelled on the many don&#39;ts board, <br/>\nthat maybe jumping into the deep end, particularly with Linnaea not being <br/>\nthe strongest of swimmers, that it might be out of bounds. But it wasn&#39;t. <br/>\nThe only thing we did wrong that whole 30 minutes or so of joyfully jumping <br/>\nin the pool was that I made a big, big splash.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is funny the things that can make you nervous. You write &quot; I told my <br/>\nhusband that I simply thought it was respectful not to use the playground <br/>\nuntil it was ready, after all none the other kids at the park were able to, <br/>\nbecause their parents wouldn&#39;t let them.&quot; But someone could use that <br/>\nargument to not unschool. I&#39;ve thought about that when I watch Simon&#39;s or <br/>\nLinnaea&#39;s friends envying aspects of our lives, asking me to talk to their <br/>\nmom to see if they could have or do what we do. I know that just by living <br/>\nas we live I am making their lives more difficult because our lives <br/>\nunderscore the lies that their parents tell them. I know that the children <br/>\nwhose parents pull them away from playing in the rain water underneath the <br/>\nancient guardhouse latrine at Barnard Castle while Simon and Linnaea wade, <br/>\ngiggle and splash will only know that they aren&#39;t allowed to do what mine <br/>\ncan freely and happily do.And maybe they&#39;ll come up with justifications, <br/>\nmaybe they&#39;ll make it better in their minds by saying that my children are <br/>\nwild or yobbish (the UK&#39;s white trash) or not as smart or as well educated, <br/>\nand I won&#39;t stop them, but that&#39;s a lie as well. And that doesn&#39;t make it <br/>\nalright for me to make Simon&#39;s or Linnaea&#39;s life smaller. My children are <br/>\nnot models of how to have a structured and by the rules kind of life. The <br/>\nfunny thing, though, is that we are very good at following the rules. The <br/>\nother day, when we were in London getting Simon&#39;s passport renewed, there <br/>\nwas a rule we were choosing to follow. I can&#39;t remember what it was. I <br/>\nreally can&#39;t remember, but it led to a discussion about following rules and <br/>\nhow, because we don&#39;t have rules in our own lives, we follow the rules that <br/>\nothers set pretty well. It seems, however falsely, that if there is a rule <br/>\nit must be for a reason, and unless the reason is ludicrous, we tend to <br/>\nrespect the rule. That doesn&#39;t mean we mindlessly follow, but it means that <br/>\nSimon and Linnaea are more likely to follow a rule than are their more <br/>\nrulebound peers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I would have swung and played and laughed and enjoyed the moment of <br/>\nhaving the new park all to ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;m just really<br/>\n&gt; wondering how some of you would of handled this...would you of played<br/>\n&gt; at the park, or no?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kendrah :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
