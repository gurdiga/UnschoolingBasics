I believe that, evolutionarily speaking, our senses have developed in a 3 ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-109941164\">4 months ago, possibly 6, what changed your mind? Why, given your families<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; enjoyment of games, were you, prior to 4-6 months ago, limiting your son&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; game time to 1 day a week?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe that, evolutionarily speaking, our senses have developed in a 3<br/>\ndimensional tactile world, not a 2d one, so I believed I was giving room for<br/>\nfull, uncluttered interaction in that world, so that he may know it<br/>\nintimately within those first few short years of his life.  We &quot;limited&quot;<br/>\ngames because that seemed to work for us.  We all saw it as a fun day to<br/>\nlook forward to.  We opened it up because of  what we had read and learned<br/>\nthrough the discussions within the unschooling community.  While everything<br/>\nelse in our house is unlimited, we considered this would naturally follow.<br/>\nSince that time we have noticed certain changes in his moods and motivations<br/>\nthat have concerned us.  We wondered if it was too much, too soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Was he doing socks games and baking and watching waterfalls with you<br/>\n&gt; because it was better than anything else that he was allowed to do and now<br/>\n&gt; there is something that he finds more engaging?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find this a little cynical and condescending, but, to answer your<br/>\nquestion, I don&#39;t think so.  It was our life.  We all seemed to enjoy it.<br/>\nHe was &quot;allowed to do&quot; all that we were allowed to do.  The house and<br/>\neverything outside of it was, and is, his to discover and explore.  My<br/>\nhusband and I didn&#39;t play video games while he sat in the corner sorting<br/>\nsocks.  The activity of sock sorting was not what was engaging, I felt.  It<br/>\nwas our interaction that made it fun--the physical, touch and talk<br/>\ninteraction.  My concern is that he is young, and these activities that I<br/>\nlisted were still meaningful enough for him to light up, and bound around<br/>\nwith innocent enjoyment of those simple activities.  I didn&#39;t hear &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\nbored&quot; until we opened up the access of the games to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it your loss and not his that you are worried about?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am sure it is a bit of both.  However, I don&#39;t feel that I would try to<br/>\nhold my son back to satisfy my need to preserve some unnatural state in our<br/>\nrelationship.  What I fear is his changing moods.  What I am saddened by is<br/>\nhis quickly-diminishing, early lack of enthusiasm for the world he once<br/>\nembraced so enthusiastically.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter loved pink when she was little. Absolutely adored the color. She<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; didn&#39;t much like to wear anything but pink, she wanted toys that were pink,<br/>\n&gt; she liked pink things. Because of her love of pink I began to really like<br/>\n&gt; pink. Really like pink. I&#39;d never liked pink that much before. It was too<br/>\n&gt; girly. But Linnaea&#39;s love of pink really brought me round to pink. And one<br/>\n&gt; day she was done. Pink just didn&#39;t do it for her. She&#39;d occasionally wear it<br/>\n&gt; for me, or do a twirl in one of the many beautiful pink dresses she had, but<br/>\n&gt; she just didn&#39;t like pink. Or, at least, she didn&#39;t like it enough to want<br/>\n&gt; to wear it all the time anymore. She&#39;d moved out of that part of her life.<br/>\n&gt; And I was sad to see that go. But that sorrow was all about me and my little<br/>\n&gt; girl who loved pink. It wasn&#39;t about Linnaea, it was about the story of the<br/>\n&gt; all pink wearing little girl I had, not the right now little girl that she<br/>\n&gt; was. Being sad about that change didn&#39;t help me to enjoy<br/>\n&gt; being with her or hanging out with her or playing with her or enjoying the<br/>\n&gt; new clothes she was choicing. I still have some of those pink clothes tucked<br/>\n&gt; in a box somewhere and I have pictures and right now there is a 9 year old<br/>\n&gt; girl lying on the floor in a black shirt with a mortocycle riding woman<br/>\n&gt; named Betty Bitch! on the back and that&#39;s really cool too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ethan loved blue.  I did the same thing as you.  I used to answer that I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have a favourite colour early on when he and his friends would ask,<br/>\nbut then I began to love blue because he did.  Now he loves red.  I still<br/>\nlove blue, and hold close the relationship that I remember that revolved<br/>\naround that colour.  But the colour change didn&#39;t change his moods.  That is<br/>\nwhat I am concerned about--the effect, not the change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Give it time. Give it time for him to stop feeling so in love with what<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s doing that he isn&#39;t interested in anything else. Give it time for him<br/>\n&gt; to trust that you aren&#39;t going And while you are giving him the time to love<br/>\n&gt; his games you could read about Julie Persons experience with her son. It was<br/>\n&gt; when she stopped waiting for him to change and started loving what he was<br/>\n&gt; doing right than that he was able to expand out and embrace more in his<br/>\n&gt; life. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/0702/JanFeb07.pdf\">http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/0702/JanFeb07.pdf</a> page 12.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do appreciate all the time you are taking to help me work through this.<br/>\nYour questions give me time to pause and consider what my concerns are and<br/>\nwhere they are coming from.  I believe so whole-heatedly in supporting my<br/>\nson as the person he is.  He is undeniably the most gentle and full of life<br/>\nperson I have had the great pleasure of knowing.

Why, given your families enjoyment of games, were you, prior to 4-6 months ago, limiting your son&#39;s game time to 1 day a week? You don&#39;t have to answer. But maybe it will help you to think about what your attitude was such that you felt the games needed to be given a special day and how much your attitude has changed since opening up his access to video games.

I just got to my computer tonight and have 13 or so replies and<br/>\nthought it might be easier to respond with a new post.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne comment I read a couple times was a suggestion that I participate with<br/>\nEthan as he plays.  Both my husband and I (or one or the other) are eager to<br/>\ndo so almost all of the time.  We both enjoy video games and the ones that<br/>\nEthan has been playing (World of Goo, Zoombinis, Crazy Machines)  are a ton<br/>\nof fun for us all.  I always set us up with some snacks and drinks, and we<br/>\nsit in cozy places anywhere around the house.  We play on our laptops.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the beginning, we been very attached parents.  We still sleep with<br/>\nEthan many nights, although now he has his own room.  Part of my need to<br/>\nhave dinner as a family is simply because we have always enjoyed that time<br/>\ntogether.  It is not a strict,<br/>\nsit-with-your-back-straight-hold-your-fork-in-your-right-hand-don&#39;t-interrupt-the-adults-or-talk-with-your-mouth-full<br/>\nkind of meal.  We laugh, play music, talk about our days--just reconnect.<br/>\nTo feel like I am losing that time together saddens me, especially at such a<br/>\nyoung age.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel like I was belittling his passion for playing games.  I like<br/>\ngames too.  They are fun.  As I said, we play with him most of the time.  We<br/>\ncheer--get excited about the next level, or doing a level over more<br/>\neffectively.  Yet, I feel concern about the lack of interest in other<br/>\nactivities that once really captivated his imagination.  I also feel like he<br/>\nlacks the motivation to do some of the simpler things that he once seemed to<br/>\nreally enjoy, and I wonder if that isn&#39;t because it doesn&#39;t provide him with<br/>\na clear reward like the games do.  We used to fold socks together.  He would<br/>\nbound on the bed and we would make a game of it, often ending up throwing<br/>\nthem at each other.  Now he shows no interest.  Socks--I can see the eyes<br/>\nrolling ;)  But, there are so many little things like this that we did<br/>\ntogether that came to an abrupt halt once he started playing the games.  I<br/>\ncan totally understand the captivation.  I can also get my mind around how<br/>\nplaying games is much more fun that folding socks with mom.  But my heart<br/>\nskips a beat to think that we have left *the simple* too fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not just socks though.  It is looking at a waterfall.  It is listening<br/>\nto the wind.  It is hearing the chickadees.  It is hearing the quiet after a<br/>\nsnowfall.  It is tasting lemons, baking cookies, drawing, painting,<br/>\nbuilding, dancing, friends.  All of these things seem to have lost their<br/>\nappeal.  He would rather play games on the computer.  I would not say that<br/>\nany one of the previous things I listed are &quot;better&quot; than video games.  But<br/>\nto substitute the diversity of the world around him for this one activity<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem balanced or healthy to my mind.  I worry that the empty spaces<br/>\nin his mind are being filled with this surreal experience, distancing him<br/>\nfrom not only the world that he was just becoming familiar with, but also<br/>\nkeeping him from fully discovering himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do have a lot around the house for him to do at all times.  There are<br/>\nseveral instruments, including djambe drums, a piano, my husband&#39;s prized<br/>\nelectric guitar, and more--all of which he has unlimited access to.  He did<br/>\nlike to play.  Now he has lost interest.  He was playing by ear too, which<br/>\nwas fun.  The first song he played was the theme song for &quot;Wallace and<br/>\nGromit.&quot;  He was delighted when he was able to find that on the piano.  We<br/>\nhave stuff to make messes, we have toys. we have books, we have puzzles, we<br/>\nhave art supplies--he has his own, or he can use mine--I am an artist.  He<br/>\nhas used a saw to cut down small trees, a hammer to build a structure out of<br/>\nwhat we cut up, a dremel tool to make patterns in wood, and a shovel to dig<br/>\nour grass up when he thought he wanted to dig a tunnel under our house (he<br/>\nthought that would be a fun hideout).  I think we do well, facilitating his<br/>\nneed to satisfy fabulous curiosity.  Yet, lately he expresses very little<br/>\ndesire to embark on some new adventure he has thought up--unless, of course,<br/>\nit is on the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, just to clarify, I spoke of changing our plan to unlimited playing<br/>\n&quot;recently.&quot;  I would say that this has been in place for at least four<br/>\nmonths, possibly six.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will read on with an open mind and grateful heart for all that will surely<br/>\nbe shared.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nKaren James and family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39021,"nextTopicId":39023}}
