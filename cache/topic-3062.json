I&#39;m glad you were there. I guess I <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t mention the struggle Laurie is going through getting comfy <br/>\nin grad school, huh? &lt;g&gt;  I spent last weekend with her and she was <br/>\npractically in tears with her assignment. I read over what she had <br/>\nto do and read a few chapters of complete gobbledy gook (in this one <br/>\nclass, she has to read 300 pages a week and write a 5-6 page <br/>\nsummary) and started asking her questions about it. It was <br/>\nfrustrating for her at first, because I didn&#39;t know enough about the <br/>\ntopic at hand to ask intelligent questions, but the more I asked and <br/>\nthe more she answered, it came clear to her what her goal was for <br/>\nthe paper. Whew! It was all so over my head that I got a headache <br/>\ntrying to think of questions. lol<br/>\n<br/>\nShe fretted and worried that she can&#39;t be an equal in this classroom <br/>\nof 7 other students, most of whom already have a PhD in another <br/>\nfield. BUT...her unschooling is showing (shining) through already. <br/>\nOut of two papers the students have had to turn in, he&#39;s picked her <br/>\npaper as &quot;best satisfies what I wanted from everyone.&quot; And it&#39;s not <br/>\nthat he&#39;s playing favorites. They aren&#39;t allowed to put their names <br/>\non their papers, so he has no idea whose paper he&#39;s liking best. As <br/>\na free-thinker, it&#39;s more natural for her to &quot;please&quot; the professor <br/>\nbecause she&#39;s writing it from her free-thinking perspective; <br/>\nsomething all professors seem to love.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just talked to her and she&#39;s feeling more confident about her <br/>\nchoice to get an accelerated PhD. The fear is fading. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nlove, Valerie<br/>\nwww.ubpub.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":101365844,"authorName":"sandy lubert","from":"&quot;sandy lubert&quot; &lt;slubert@...&gt;","profile":"slubert","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Hey Valerie","postDate":"1094684865","msgId":3062,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNobzNjMStqYW5qQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3108,"prevInTime":3061,"nextInTime":3063,"topicId":3062,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Valerie-I had the privilege of hearing you in Peabody.
