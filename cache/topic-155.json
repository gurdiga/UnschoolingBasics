The things I do know are: \nshe is almost purely a visual learner, she is smart, she likes to figure out \nthings on her own, she needs more structure than my other children and she needs \nto run, swing, jump, climb, swim and ride bikes many many times a day \n(impossible in a regular school setting!). This child really needs to move to be \nable to think. &nbsp;I look forward to reading the posts and hopefully being \nable to contribute!
