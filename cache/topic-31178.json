You clean it up.&quot; That really felt <br/>\nyucky.

Whether it&#39;s probable or not is<br/>\nanother discussion entirely.  I think if you aren&#39;t familiar with Maslow&#39;s<br/>\nwork, you should look at it.  In fact I&#39;m going to copy it here because I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s very important to most of the RU concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n Maslow has set up a hierarchy of five levels of basic needs. Beyond these<br/>\nneeds, higher levels of needs exist. These include needs for understanding,<br/>\nesthetic appreciation and purely spiritual needs. In the levels of the five<br/>\nbasic needs, the person does not feel the second need until the demands of<br/>\nthe first have been satisfied, nor the third until the second has been<br/>\nsatisfied, and so on. Maslow&#39;s basic needs are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n*Physiological Needs*<br/>\nThese are biological needs. They consist of needs for oxygen, food, water,<br/>\nand a relatively constant body temperature. They are the strongest needs<br/>\nbecause if a person were deprived of all needs, the physiological ones would<br/>\ncome first in the person&#39;s search for satisfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Safety Needs*<br/>\nWhen all physiological needs are satisfied and are no longer controlling<br/>\nthoughts and behaviors, the needs for security can become active. Adults<br/>\nhave little awareness of their security needs except in times of emergency<br/>\nor periods of disorganization in the social structure (such as widespread<br/>\nrioting). Children often display the signs of insecurity and the need to be<br/>\nsafe.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Needs of Love, Affection and Belongingness*<br/>\nWhen the needs for safety and for physiological well-being are satisfied,<br/>\nthe next class of needs for love, affection and belongingness can emerge.<br/>\nMaslow states that people seek to overcome feelings of loneliness and<br/>\nalienation. This involves both giving and receiving love, affection and the<br/>\nsense of belonging.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Needs for Esteem*<br/>\nWhen the first three classes of needs are satisfied, the needs for esteem<br/>\ncan become dominant. These involve needs for both self-esteem and for the<br/>\nesteem a person gets from others. Humans have a need for a stable, firmly<br/>\nbased, high level of self-respect, and respect from others. When these needs<br/>\nare satisfied, the person feels self-confident and valuable as a person in<br/>\nthe world. When these needs are frustrated, the person feels inferior, weak,<br/>\nhelpless and worthless.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Needs for Self-Actualization*<br/>\nWhen all of the foregoing needs are satisfied, then and only then are the<br/>\nneeds for self-actualization activated. Maslow describes self-actualization<br/>\nas a person&#39;s need to be and do that which the person was &quot;born to do.&quot; &quot;A<br/>\nmusician must make music, an artist must paint, and a poet must write.&quot;<br/>\nThese needs make themselves felt in signs of restlessness. The person feels<br/>\non edge, tense, lacking something, in short, restless. If a person is<br/>\nhungry, unsafe, not loved or accepted, or lacking self-esteem, it is very<br/>\neasy to know what the person is restless about. It is not always clear what<br/>\na person wants when there is a need for self-actualization.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hierarchic theory is often represented as a pyramid, with the larger,<br/>\nlower levels representing the lower needs, and the upper point representing<br/>\nthe need for self-actualization. Maslow believes that the only reason that<br/>\npeople would not move well in direction of self-actualization is because of<br/>\nhindrances placed in their way by society. He states that education is one<br/>\nof these hindrances. He recommends ways education can switch from its usual<br/>\nperson-stunting tactics to person-growing approaches. Maslow states that<br/>\neducators should respond to the potential an individual has for growing into<br/>\na self-actualizing person of his/her own kind. Ten points that educators<br/>\nshould address are listed:<br/>\n 1.)We should teach people to be authentic, to be aware of their inner<br/>\nselves and to hear their inner-feeling voices.<br/>\n2.)We should teach people to transcend their cultural conditioning and<br/>\nbecome world citizens.<br/>\n3.)We should help people discover their vocation in life, their calling,<br/>\nfate or destiny. This is especially focused on finding the right career and<br/>\nthe right mate.<br/>\n4.)We should teach people that life is precious, that there is joy to be<br/>\nexperienced in life, and if people are open to seeing the good and joyous in<br/>\nall kinds of situations, it makes life worth living.<br/>\n5.)We must accept the person as he or she is and help the person learn their<br/>\ninner nature. From real knowledge of aptitudes and limitations we can know<br/>\nwhat to build upon, what potentials are really there.<br/>\n6.)We must see that the person&#39;s basic needs are satisfied. This includes<br/>\nsafety, belongingness, and esteem needs.<br/>\n7.)We should refreshen consciousness, teaching the person to appreciate<br/>\nbeauty and the other good things in nature and in living.<br/>\n8.)We should teach people that controls are good, and complete abandon is<br/>\nbad. It takes control to improve the quality of life in all areas.<br/>\n9.)We should teach people to transcend the trifling problems and grapple<br/>\nwith the serious problems in life. These include the problems of injustice,<br/>\nof pain, suffering, and death.<br/>\n10.)We must teach people to be good choosers. They must be given practice in<br/>\nmaking good choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether or not education can or would do these things is again another<br/>\nsubject all together.  We all know that education&#39;s end is to make all pegs<br/>\nthe exact same shape by using extreme pressure.  But Maslow&#39;s work is sound<br/>\nIMO.<br/>\n --<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://temptabo.blogspot.com/\">http://temptabo.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"&quot;Karen Swanay&quot; &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Feeling Unrespected","postDate":"1206274621","msgId":31195,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwMzIzMDUxN24xMzEwMjY2NG5iZmZlMjg0YmMzY2I3OTY0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEIyNTAwODAwLTU0MUMtNDc1RS04QTVDLTIyRTc1MzA2NDg4RkBtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEyODA5NS42ODcyNy5xbUB3ZWI1MjQwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+CSA8NjdhOWQ3NTAwODAzMjIwOTE2dDdlYmY3NzRkc2RmZjFlMzUxODU3OTg1MmVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8QjI1MDA4MDAtNTQxQy00NzVFLThBNUMtMjJFNzUzMDY0ODhGQG1hYy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":31194,"nextInTopic":31196,"prevInTime":31194,"nextInTime":31196,"topicId":31178,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... **************************************************************************************************************************** I wanted to mention two things","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-147718718\">On Sun, Mar 23, 2008 at 12:04 AM, Pamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Most parents punish their kids and believe the kids will learn from<br/>\n&gt; that or, at least, be deterred by the negative reinforcement.

The first is I don&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve animals like to be trained either.  Unfortunately, if they<br/>\npoop in the middle of the living room floor, most are exposed to<br/>\nbeatings or dumped at the animal shelter so they have little choice.<br/>\nWe humans, force the animals to conform to our way of living.  Just<br/>\nbecause a dog follows you home doesn&#39;t mean he wants you to tie him on<br/>\na 3&#39; chain in the backyard.  So whether or not animals *enjoy* being<br/>\ntrained is up for major debate.  I know my clients&#39; pets enjoy seeing<br/>\nme because when I come they are rewarded for being right.  I speak to<br/>\nthem in happy voices, ignore the failures and reward the correct steps<br/>\nand always end on a positive note.  And they like that, but IMO what<br/>\nthey like is that I am *genuinely* happy to see them as they are.<br/>\nWith sloppy sits, with the occasional bite, and their incessant<br/>\nbarking.  Which is different than the regime under which they live.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd punishers don&#39;t work with animals.  Not in the way we think they<br/>\ndo.  Punishment *NEVER* results in a predictable change in behavior.<br/>\nNever.  Animals can learn not to get on the sofa by getting beaten<br/>\nwith the broom.  But they either associate the owner with intense<br/>\nfear, or the couch.  Neither one of those ties the behavior of getting<br/>\nON the couch to the punishment.  I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s the same in<br/>\nchildren but with kids I have only my own &quot;field study&quot; to draw on.<br/>\nWhereas I can call myself an *expert* in behaviorism...for animals in<br/>\ngeneral but dogs and cats specifically.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://temptabo.blogspot.com/\">http://temptabo.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Feeling Unrespected","postDate":"1206262295","msgId":31194,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBRjI2RjEzLURDNzUtNEE5NC05RTc1LTg5QTcxNUVDOTJDMUBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDI3YWEyYWU4MDgwMzIyMjMwNHI3NWEzMjA2cTFkY2EyZmY3MjAxYTY2MDJAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDEyODA5NS42ODcyNy5xbUB3ZWI1MjQwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+IDw2N2E5ZDc1MDA4MDMyMjA5MTZ0N2ViZjc3NGRzZGZmMWUzNTE4NTc5ODUyZUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPEIyNTAwODAwLTU0MUMtNDc1RS04QTVDLTIyRTc1MzA2NDg4RkBtYWMuY29tPiA8MjdhYTJhZTgwODAzMjIyMzA0cjc1YTMyMDZxMWRjYTJmZjcyMDFhNjYwMkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":31193,"nextInTopic":31195,"prevInTime":31193,"nextInTime":31195,"topicId":31178,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And if you decided to keep<br/>\nyour mouth shut for the sake of peace and trying to put your marriage<br/>\nback together, does that mean it doesn&#39;t bother you, really?<br/>\n<br/>\nI urge you to reconsider how you handle these issues, because kids<br/>\nwant and need to be able to count on their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren *noobie to RU but veteran at behavioral science*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://temptabo.blogspot.com/\">http://temptabo.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337265206,"authorName":"brad jones","from":"brad jones &lt;bhmjones@...&gt;","profile":"bhmjones","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Feeling Unrespected","postDate":"1206201396","msgId":31181,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyODA5NS42ODcyNy5xbUB3ZWI1MjQwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31182,"prevInTime":31180,"nextInTime":31182,"topicId":31178,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This same daughter is wonderful at helping, please don t jump to the conclusion that my daughter doesn t understand why she is being punished and she does not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1580275349\">This same daughter is wonderful at helping, please don&#39;t jump to the conclusion that my daughter doesn&#39;t understand why she is being punished and she does not wish me ill will when I punish her, often I never follow through with it at all, I do threaten it tho and it is not harsh, it really is more often a discussion between her and I.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Kendrah Nilsestuen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:carebear-79@...\">carebear-79@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, March 22, 2008 9:54:17 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Feeling Unrespected<br/>\n<br/>\n**She doesn&#39;t like the putting them<br/>\nback up part but will do it when she finds out that she won&#39;t get <br/>\ncomputer<br/>\nprivileges or some other (dare I say it here &lt;BWG&gt;) punishment if she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t.**<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is just me and the kids and I realize I&#39;m stuck on the toilet with <br/>\nno toilet paper! I go to change my son&#39;s diaper and realize I have <br/>\nforgotten the wipes, or a replacement diaper. In these situations I <br/>\nhave to call my 4 y/o to bring me these things. She always is happily <br/>\nwilling. I wonder if this would be so if I punished her for not <br/>\npicking her things up.<br/>\nIn our house we all help one another. If I see her toys, and they are <br/>\nin my way. I pick them up, or offer creative ways we can do them <br/>\ntogether. I show consideration for her things. Then when I have <br/>\naccidentally left something out, I see the same consideration shown <br/>\nto mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nKendrah:)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?  <br/>\nFind them fast with Yahoo!
