There are<br/>\nusually shoes around the shoe basket but not necessarily IN the shoe basket<br/>\nand sometimes the shoes are other places in the house.

They&#39;re so focused on what they&#39;re  <br/>\ndoing next that they aren&#39;t aware of what they&#39;re doing now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a dark bathroom that&#39;s off a bright hallway.

I  <br/>\nalready care about electricity. I can&#39;t be more aware. Should my  <br/>\nfamily yell at me? Should my family make me stop what I was doing to  <br/>\ngo turn off the light? I think that would just create tension in our  <br/>\nrelationships. What would work is if someone sees the light on to  <br/>\nturn it off! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are just oblivious to their surrounds. Especially kids.  <br/>\nThe bathroom sink had gotten pretty dirty and every time I&#39;d look at  <br/>\nit I&#39;d sigh in irritation. But my husband would even see it. Then one  <br/>\nday he cleaned out his electric razor and decided to wipe the hairs  <br/>\nout and disturbed the thick film on it and was surprised. He really  <br/>\nand truly hadn&#39;t seen the dirt before that. (Lucky me! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust that your kids are doing the best they can with the skills they  <br/>\nhave.

Your post<br/>\nhelped me realize why I was uncomfortable with what I<br/>\nhad said. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son (9) has recently developed the habit of<br/>\ndropping everything - shoes, toys, bike helmet,<br/>\nfood...whatever he has in his hands - *right* in front<br/>\nof the main door and everyone keeps tripping over the<br/>\npile. The area where he leaves his things is also<br/>\nright at the bottom of the stairs. He took the dog out<br/>\nfor a walk when we got home from our family&#39;s Easter<br/>\ndinner last night and left his shoes on the bottom<br/>\nstep. I came down the stairs with a load of laundry<br/>\nand tripped over his shoes. I said &quot;Cameron, I have<br/>\n*ASKED* you not to put your things right in front of<br/>\nthe door/at the bottom of the stairs more times than I<br/>\ncan count lately and you still did it *again*! Please<br/>\nget your shoes out of the way before someone really<br/>\ngets hurt!&quot; I was frustrated so it came out more<br/>\nharshly than I meant it to, so he got upset because I<br/>\nwas &quot;yelling&quot; at him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t realize at the time that I had been<br/>\n*expecting* that he would either do as I asked or give<br/>\nme his reason for saying &quot;no&quot;. There has rarely been a<br/>\ntime when he didn&#39;t do one of those two things, so I<br/>\njust *assumed* that he would in this case as well.<br/>\nInstead he has been agreeing with my explanations<br/>\nabout why this was not a safe place to put his stuff<br/>\nand moving them when I asked, but continuing to drop<br/>\nhis stuff there until I either asked him to move them<br/>\nor I moved them myself. This goes on many, many times<br/>\na day. He has also been leaving a trail of clothes,<br/>\ndirty dishes and trash wherever he goes in the house.<br/>\nThis is a completely new way of acting for him. Before<br/>\nnow he has always put his clothes in the hamper,<br/>\nrinsed his own dishes, put away most of his things<br/>\nhimself, and thrown away his trash (candy wrappers and<br/>\nsuch). Not at our insistence but just because that&#39;s<br/>\nthe way he&#39;s always been. When he was a toddler he<br/>\njust emulated us and has continued to do so. We never<br/>\nreally had to ask, he just did these things. Now,<br/>\nhowever, it&#39;s like he&#39;s walking around in a daze and<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t even realize what he&#39;s doing.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt hasn&#39;t escaped my attention that this change in his<br/>\nbehavior coincided with him suddenly looking and<br/>\nacting &quot;older&quot;. Around the time of his last growth<br/>\nspurt he started becoming more muscular, getting acne<br/>\nand talking about girls as if he&#39;s aware of them as<br/>\nmore than just playmates (though he&#39;s not quite ready<br/>\nto &quot;like&quot; them just yet). He has also been worrying<br/>\nabout how his hair looks (he used to be famous for his<br/>\n&quot;bed head&quot;) and even asked me to buy him deodorant the<br/>\nother day. I have to wonder if it is all related. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure how this will all work out. We&#39;ll just play<br/>\nit by ear as usual I suppose. He&#39;s my oldest so I feel<br/>\nlike I&#39;m fumbling in the dark most of the time.<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ll stop rambling now. All I really meant to<br/>\nsay was &quot;thanks&quot; for your wording. It really helped me<br/>\nsee my part of the situation last night more clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\nJessica  <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
