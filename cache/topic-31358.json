DS hasn&#39;t cracked a book in I don&#39;t know how long. He&#39;s an online creature. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs is DD.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just noticing how comfortable both of them are on line. Just agile in a way I never will be. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, none of this has anything to do with your kids. Go with the flow and their desires. It will all click when they are ready. <br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31325,"nextTopicId":31359}}
