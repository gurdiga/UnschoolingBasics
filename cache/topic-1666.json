Too much time can <br/>\nbe lost on tv, if we aren&#39;t careful, but that is OUR lifestyle.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t have to be educational, but we avoid the channels like <br/>\ncartoon network and even Nick, because of all the commercialism on <br/>\nthem.  I HATE the commercials on any channel, even Disney, so we are <br/>\ncareful what is watched in our house.  The tv seems to show the USA&#39;s <br/>\nloss of morals. imho.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Amanda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Providing &quot;tools&quot; was Re: gentler way of talking to k...","postDate":"1089381837","msgId":1666,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkuMmRiODU1Y2MuMmUxZmZmY2RAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1701,"prevInTime":1665,"nextInTime":1667,"topicId":1666,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/9/2004 9:35:18 AM Eastern Daylight Time, earthmothergypsy@hotmail.com writes: It can also be a box of tools, it can be woodcarving tools","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1924515357\">In a message dated 7/9/2004 9:35:18 AM Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:earthmothergypsy@...\">earthmothergypsy@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt  <br/>\ncan also be a box of tools, it can be woodcarving tools and supplies,  <br/>\nand workbooks for the ones that want to &quot;play&quot;  school.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nIf you don&#39;t call workbooks &quot;playing school,&quot; they can just be another  <br/>\n&quot;tool&quot;.
