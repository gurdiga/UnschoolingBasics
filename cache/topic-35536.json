We did not have to have an approved curriculum North Carolina requirements are fairly easy for any style of homeschooling, they do prefer that at least one of the teachers have or be working on a college degree, though they will accept a high school diploma or GED. You need to fill out a form from the North Carolina Division of Non-Public Education, here is the link to their site as well: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ncdnpe.org/hhh103.\">http://www.ncdnpe.org/hhh103.</a> htm. As for progress, hang on to cool neat projects that are done, attendance isn&#39;t hard to do either, technically an unschooler never misses a single day. What is set on paper and what actually happens anywhere is not always the same. What I learned from my classroom training and clinical training as a nurses aide helped when I first started to work, but it left out a lot of things such as facility policies and procedures which can over ride what is in the text<br/>\n book. Not quite the same scenario, but I was just trying to empahsize that the home school requirements are not as stringent as they actually appear on paper and that you can make your record keeping reflect what the state law requires. I called and spoke at length with the NCDNPE, and they had no problem with us creating our curriculum, it was up to us to make sure our children learned. The only real pain in the butt was having to have standardized testing done once a year, you have to pay for this and it is expensive. But contact the NCDNPE and speak with their reps, they were most helpful. There are also some really good support groups in NC that can help you wade through all the legal mumbo jumbo.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, keep in mind unschooling is still home schooling, just a different method and one that is more of a lifestyle than just a way of teaching. <br/>\n<br/>\nTammy C.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: heimanrobert &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heimanrobert@...\">heimanrobert@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, August 23, 2008 9:30:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Legal Aspect<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if the same laws that apply to homeschoolers also apply <br/>\nto unschoolers.
