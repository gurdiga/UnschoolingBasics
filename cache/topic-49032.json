Imagine all your very favorite things in the world and your husband is hovering over you waiting for you to get rid of half because he doesn&#39;t deem the space in the truck worthy enough for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how your daughter will see it. You can&#39;t change her point of view. Only age can. Only the power to be able to keep it all will allow her to eventually let some of it go.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost parents will dismiss that idea because convenience is more important than some &quot;silly nonsense&quot; of their kids. And most parents end up with difficult relationships with their kids in a large part because they put their own convenience ahead of their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mindful thing to do is NOT to never do something for fear of hurting the kids. That would just be a new set of rules. The mindful thing is to be aware of how a child perceives the way they&#39;re being treated. Treat them with awareness that they trust you to be their advocate in the world. And if for some reason you feel you need to break that trust, take it seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The volume of things she has<br/>\n&gt; is overwhelming.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, some kids are like that. And the more you can help them hold onto things, the more at peace they can feel that they have some control over the world, and then the sooner they can feel free to let things go. But you can&#39;t rush it, only reinforce their feeling the world is beyond their control and make them cling tighter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would do is start organizing it. Bring in boxes and bags for trash, recycling and donations. But don&#39;t pressure her to put anything in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can ask her if she has some ideas on how to organize it. Some kids love that. But don&#39;t pressure her. If she feels overwhelmed, you&#39;ll need to do most of the organizing and deciding. Judge by her reactions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she doesn&#39;t have ideas, organize drawings by age. Separate out things that are being kept but not used and pack those separately. So perhaps they can be stored and not add to the confusion in the new place. Perhaps create boxes of things she likes that can be rotated.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee her things as part of her. See her desire to keep everything as part of her. By insisting she must give things up you&#39;re saying in effect you wish she were different.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll be different when she is different.
