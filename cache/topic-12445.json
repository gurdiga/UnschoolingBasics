Hi Deb, Thank you for that beautiful post.  All these adjectives have been used to describe our new 2 year old foster child.  Your description of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1111343513\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***tantrums***<br/>\n&gt; Tantrum is a very negative word.  It implies the person is not really<br/>\n&gt; suffering but is just &quot;acting out&quot; for some purpose of manipulation.  If<br/>\n&gt; a kid has reached a point of emotional crisis and no on has moved to help<br/>\n&gt; him he&#39;s hurt, he&#39;s not having a tantrum.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Deb,<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for that beautiful post.  All these adjectives have been used to <br/>\ndescribe our new 2 year old foster child.  Your description of tantrumming is so <br/>\ntrue.  This baby is not manipulative, he is suffering which I already knew.  <br/>\nI am going to eliminate the word tantrum from my vocabulary as well as the <br/>\nother harmful words.  I have been getting frustrated with this child and am going <br/>\nto try harder to meet him where he is at instead of trying to mold him to fit <br/>\ninto our world.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen,<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for yet another amazing post.  Your words about how adding another <br/>\nchild takes away time and attention from our own kids is very true but added <br/>\nto my frustration and feelings of inadequacy after I read it.  I justify it by <br/>\nthinking that it can also be a growing experience for our kids as well as a <br/>\ncompassion builder.  We take in foster kids mostly because there are so many out <br/>\nthere who no one will take in.  This baby has been in 8 homes since July and <br/>\nthe families give up because of all his &quot;issues&quot; which include: <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; has MAJOR meltdowns and tantrums<br/>\n&gt; gets frustrated soooo easily<br/>\n&gt; getting extremely angry<br/>\n&gt; has some developmental issues, <br/>\n&gt; has characteristics of aspergers, adhd, and ppd <br/>\n&gt; asks me the same questions over and over and over and over<br/>\n&gt; I just have to stop him. Repeatedly.  From smashing things, banging his <br/>\n </span></blockquote>head, etc.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He must be spoken to very simply and plainly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The truth is, after reading your post yesterday I have been questioning <br/>\nwhether our choice to take in foster kids is detrimental to our own children and <br/>\nmaybe we should stop doing it.  I have a very hard time saying no when I get <br/>\nthese calls.  All this self doubt is your fault, Ren!  I&#39;ve learned so much from <br/>\nyour wise posts and have come to really trust what you think and your opinion <br/>\nmatters to me.  As I sat up with William (the foster baby) at 2:30 this <br/>\nmorning, I was thinking how I&#39;d probably have less patience with my own kids after <br/>\nlosing sleep again rocking this &quot;extra&quot; child.  I am probably selling out my <br/>\nown to help other people&#39;s kids.  Yikes!  With this one high need child in <br/>\nparticular I realize that the best thing for my kids is to find him another home <br/>\nbut that&#39;s hard.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you write these words that cause me to think so much?!?  Just kidding, <br/>\nI really do appreciate all your wisdom ladies.  I have to take a long, hard <br/>\nlook at myself and our family and figure out what&#39;s best.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!  I truly do appreciate your posts even if I don&#39;t want to &quot;hear <br/>\nit&quot; it gets into my brain.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and for the frustrated mother who listed the above issues describing her <br/>\nson--try hugging him everytime you or he gets frustrated.  It works 95% of the <br/>\ntime with William.  Comfort is a wonderful tool, regardless of the problem or <br/>\nissue.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nRobin in MA, going to hug the husband, who comforts me during my tantrums!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12444,"nextTopicId":12466}}
