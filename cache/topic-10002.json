It seems that there<br/>\nis but there are so many unschooling places that I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen to that I can&#39;t begin to narrow it down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really, really want to write things down.  Even with<br/>\nBrooke being so interested in things when I tried<br/>\ntotally unschooling before, she&#39;d be on the phone with<br/>\nthe grandparents and they&#39;d ask, &quot;So what have you<br/>\nbeen learning?&quot;  to which she replies, &quot;Um, I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow&quot;....LOL  It made the kids uncomfortable to say<br/>\n&quot;nothing, I don&#39;t know&quot;, if we get some lingo going on<br/>\nI think we&#39;d all be more comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW...the video game Spartan did spark Zachary into<br/>\nwanting to learn about Greek gods and such.  Sorry<br/>\nthat I neglected to stress that point.  <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
