Unschooling is commonly defined as not doing school in one<br/>\nsegment of the unschooling community. As a result, many people<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t consider any type of school environment unschooling. However,<br/>\nthere are people who consider using workbooks and other schoolish<br/>\nmethodolgy, like homework and testing to be unschooling, if the child<br/>\nis agreeable. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many folks who lean toward incorporating the &quot;parenting&quot;<br/>\nrelationship into unschooling. This usually is what is referred to as<br/>\n&quot;radical unschooling&quot;. When the parent &quot;allows&quot; the child to have<br/>\nfreedom over culturally derived &quot;parenting&quot; choices, like bedtimes,<br/>\nfood choices, tv viewing (quantity, selection, ratings, etc.). So,<br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; means a lot of different  things to a lot of different<br/>\npeople. You were briefly on the Consensual Living list where many of<br/>\nus are radical unschoolers. But we find win-win solutions outside <br/>\nand within our relationships with children. This may be the confusion.<br/>\nConsensual living does believe that we can create win-win for<br/>\neveryone, not just for children or parental relationships. I saw that<br/>\nyou asked about TCS also. TCS is an educational philosophy which<br/>\ndictates that it is ammoral to coerce a child, and that it impairs<br/>\ntheir learning. TCS is not embraced in this segment of the unschooling<br/>\ncommunity. TCS is a judgment paradigm that dictates a parent&#39;s<br/>\nresponsibility to optimize their child&#39;s learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nConsensual Living is not an educational philosophy. It is a philosophy<br/>\n and a process by which everyone&#39;s needs are equally valid, considered<br/>\nand addressed to mutual agreement. Unschooling basically is not doing<br/>\nschool. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps to tease out the overlap and differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":280005589,"authorName":"Solé","from":"=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Sol=E9?= &lt;solelokuai@...&gt;","profile":"solelokua","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: sudbury valley school","postDate":"1160430598","msgId":18036,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxM0FGRTA4LUE0MjYtNEQwOC1BQzIyLUQyNThDMDMxOTRCNkBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGM0OS41MDJhMzE0LjMyNWJlMjlkQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGM0OS41MDJhMzE0LjMyNWJlMjlkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":18032,"nextInTopic":18037,"prevInTime":18035,"nextInTime":18037,"topicId":17997,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you!","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1880372915\">Thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nAm 09.10.2006 um 19:36 schrieb <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KathrynJB@...\">KathrynJB@...</a>:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Johanna, I happen to have a recent Sudbury-type school grad staying  <br/>\n&gt; with us<br/>\n&gt; right now.

It was completely her<br/>\ndecision to go and she was welcome to unschool at anytime.  The schools were<br/>\ncompletely different in atmosphere and I think her experience at the second<br/>\nwas probably freer, just due to the mix of staff and students.  Both were<br/>\nvery small schools, with attendance never going above about 15 kids and ages<br/>\nranged from 4 or 5 to mid teens.  She went to these schools in 2001-2002 and<br/>\n2002-2003 when she was 8 and 9. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember in the first one (in the Silicon Valley in California) there<br/>\nbeing a little more emphasis on school meetings and chores, but Chloe liked<br/>\nit all for some reason.  I actually would have preferred that she unschool<br/>\nat that point, but her best homeschooling friends were going to that school,<br/>\nso we let her finish out the year.  There was nothing required of the kids<br/>\nbesides their daily chore (which they got to choose and never bothered<br/>\nChloe) and their duty on the &quot;board&quot; which rotated so they weren&#39;t doing it<br/>\nfor more than a week at a time.  Otherwise they played on computers for<br/>\nhours, played the piano, watched movies, jumped off an indoor loft, did arts<br/>\nand crafts, cooked, and played outside a fair amount.  They did a few<br/>\nwalking trips to the main drag to get videos and treats, but didn&#39;t leave<br/>\nthe campus much.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe moved the Maui after that and specifically searched out the Sudbury<br/>\nschool there because she enjoyed her time at the first school so much.<br/>\nEveryone involved in that school, from staff to students and parents, was<br/>\nmuch more on the &quot;hippie&quot; side of things.  This school was in a house, so<br/>\nhad a more home-like atmosphere.  The choice to go there was Chloe&#39;s, but it<br/>\nreally helped her in the move because she had instant friends.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think this one was even more fun for Chloe.  She and the other kids played<br/>\noutside and jumped on trampolines for hours.  They did all sorts of arts and<br/>\ncrafts projects which were just up her alley.  There was just a lot of play<br/>\ngoing on, LEGO structures abounded and there were some kids who were always<br/>\nbuilding skateboard ramps and stuff like that.   They also took walks to a<br/>\nlocal tourist stand for fruit and treats, and they took field trips to<br/>\nwaterfalls to jump off the rocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we moved back to the mainland we decided not to look for a place that<br/>\nhad a Sudbury school because that was too limiting for us (in choosing a<br/>\nplace to live).  We went back to unschooling as usual.  I think that Chloe<br/>\nlooks back on her time at the Sudbury schools fondly, especially the second<br/>\none.  Perhaps due to the location of that one, it seemed like an idyllic<br/>\nyear.  The worst part for me was the drive to get there (1/2 hour one way<br/>\nfor both schools).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend that you check out the school and spend some time there<br/>\nbefore making a decision.  What do the kids do?  What resources are<br/>\navailable?  What is the age range of the kids?  In both schools that Chloe<br/>\nwent to, the kids were required to try it for a week before fully<br/>\nregistering, so you can get an idea of the atmosphere.  If we had to choose<br/>\nbetween public school and Sudbury with no possibility of unschooling, I<br/>\nwould definitely choose Sudbury at least to start with and let the child<br/>\ndecide if it works.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to email me off list if you have more questions.<br/>\nKristin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Solé<br/>\nhas anybody heard/does anyone know anything about &quot;Sudbury Valley  <br/>\nSchools<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings<br/>\nJohanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":280005589,"authorName":"Solé","from":"=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Sol=E9?= &lt;solelokuai@...&gt;","profile":"solelokua","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: sudbury valley school","postDate":"1160408085","msgId":18021,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ3RDg5MUNGLTcyMTUtNEVERi04NzY4LTYwQ0YwRDdBMTI2MkBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVnZGpmZytlcTl2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVnZGpmZytlcTl2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18013,"nextInTopic":18023,"prevInTime":18020,"nextInTime":18022,"topicId":17997,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
