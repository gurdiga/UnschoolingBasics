Slow to respond <br/>\nbecause I have been out of town.  I will continue to talk to my ds <br/>\nand find a solution that works for us both.  And I will definitely <br/>\ntalk to my neighbor about her son&#39;s dangerous behavior.  I realize a <br/>\nlot of our stress lately (my oldest ds has been angry and explosive, <br/>\nmy 5yo has been distant and a little unpredictable) has been because <br/>\nof our new neighbors.  They are so used to having someone tell them <br/>\nwhat to do, they don&#39;t know how to handle the kind of freedom that <br/>\nmy kids live with.  I feel like I need to lay down some rules for <br/>\nthem while they are at our house.  At the same time I want my kids <br/>\nto continue to have their freedoms.  And I don&#39;t want to isolate <br/>\nthem from everyone.  They already spend so much time at home away <br/>\nfrom other people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been working so long training myself about unschooling and <br/>\ncreating an environment that works for my kids.

My feeling is that five is too young to <br/>\nkeep himself safe out of sight of a responsible adult. Freedom is great within <br/>\nappropriate boundaries.  You wrote that what you&#39;ve seen his friend do isn&#39;t <br/>\nsafe so follow your instinct.  Ride together or allow him the freedom to ride in <br/>\nfront of your house where you can see him at all times. I know of very few <br/>\nfive year olds who realize the consequences of their actions--like riding in the <br/>\nstreet.  What would I do?  I&#39;d reel him in and let him chase his older friend <br/>\nonly when I could be out there with them.  I&#39;d also talk to the eight year old <br/>\nkids mother as you mentioned, immediately.  It would be horrific for a five <br/>\nyear old to learn about street safety from seeing his friend get squished.  <br/>\n <br/>\nRobin in MA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":299286442,"authorName":"Cameron Parham","from":"Cameron Parham &lt;acsp2205@...&gt;","profile":"acsp2205","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Scenario - what would *you* do?","postDate":"1175476898","msgId":22928,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgwNjIxNS4yMzg2Ni5xbUB3ZWI1OTIxMy5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":22906,"nextInTopic":22932,"prevInTime":22927,"nextInTime":22929,"topicId":22906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here goes...Personally I would not let my 5yo ride bikes with this 7yo anymore for some years.

My 5 yo jumps on his <br/>\ntricycle and follows after him. One day my ds went down the street <br/>\nto a very busy street that we live near. He rode his tricycle down <br/>\nthe sidwalk of the busy street. When I realized he was missing and <br/>\nnoone knew where he was, we all jumped in the van and went to find <br/>\nhim. He was on the sidewalk with tear-stained cheeks followed by a <br/>\nwoman. She said there had been a man following him. She asked the <br/>\nman if he knew my ds, he said no. My son very firmly informed her <br/>\nthat he did not need her help. There were about 4 cars stopped and <br/>\npeople were out of their homes watching. Everyone was quite <br/>\nconcerned about my dear son. He&#39;s small for his age and riding a <br/>\ntricycle made him look a lot younger I think.

I told him we could map out some <br/>\npaths that he could ride.  That way he could ride down path A, B or <br/>\nC.  And I would know where to find him.  And he wouldn&#39;t explore <br/>\nsomeplace and get lost.  I want to empower him.  But I want him to <br/>\nbe safe.  We went on one walk.  He was uninterested in going on any <br/>\nmore. <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, neighbor boy ran out and got on his bike.  Ds followed.  <br/>\nI watched.  They crossed the street, then crossed back, then rode <br/>\nright down the middle of the street.  I went to get my ds.  We <br/>\ntalked about not riding down the street.  I offered to take him on a <br/>\nnew path that crosses that very same street at the stop sign.  He <br/>\nsaid. &quot;Let me think, um, never&quot;.  Meaning, he didn&#39;t want to have <br/>\nanything to do with my idea.  But then he said he would tomorrow.  <br/>\nAnyway, the neighbor continued to ride his bike down the street.  <br/>\nThere were several times that cars had to stop for him.  He wasn&#39;t <br/>\nwatching at all.  The last time I found them out there, my ds was <br/>\nsitting on the sidewalk watching this boy.  DS was very scared for <br/>\nhim.  I finally piled everyone in the car (except the neighbor) to <br/>\ngo get some ice cream.  We talked a lot about how he, the neighbor <br/>\nboy, was being unsafe.  I&#39;m going to talk to his mom about it <br/>\nbecause she thinks he&#39;s at our house playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I want my son to have freedom.  I trust him.  He is smart.  <br/>\nI want him to be safe.  Sometimes he so desperately wants to follow <br/>\nhis friend, he doesnt&#39; pay attention to what is around him.  Any <br/>\nadvice about neighbor kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel in OK</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22976,"nextTopicId":22927}}
