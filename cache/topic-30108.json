He forced a math curriculum on the two older boys because he<br/>\nwasn&#39;t &quot;convinced&quot;.  I find him very verbally abusive.  for the first<br/>\ntime I actually let her in on how I feel about him.  I feel so weird<br/>\nabout that.  i just felt she needed to hear it.  The problem that I<br/>\nsee is that husband and wife are not communicating.  At all.  And the<br/>\nkids are suffering.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m guessing he won&#39;t listen to *anything* though. Or do you think he <br/>\n&gt; wants to change?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a tough one.  It seems to go back and forth.  What I do know<br/>\nis that he will not listen to me or my husband (his oldest son from a<br/>\nprevious marriage)and we are not terribly comfortable discussing this<br/>\nwith him (yet).  So I felt that since she came to me, I could try and<br/>\nput a few tools into her hands.  :-)  I always see her trying to do<br/>\nthe right thing, they have been unschooling so much longer, but for<br/>\nsome reason it just doesn&#39;t go smoothly  their house (unless he isn&#39;t<br/>\nthere).  I feel like they are so much older, yet so much more immature<br/>\nin their dealings with each other!  I would say he is the bigger<br/>\nproblem, but I&#39;m not sure she is handling it well either.  My son who<br/>\nspends some time there, recently told me &quot;they fight all the time&quot;. <br/>\n(meaning argue)  Needless to say visits have been shortened.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink my kids need to witness their dirty laundry, KWIM?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n&gt; Conference Coordinator<br/>\n&gt; Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; More new features than ever.
