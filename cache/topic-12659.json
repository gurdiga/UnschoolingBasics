Do you explain WHY for each rule, <br/>\ndiscipline, etc?  (Yeah, I know, a lot of people here would say that <br/>\ndiscipline is a dirty word, but I don&#39;t mean it as corporal <br/>\npunishment.)  There are logical consequences, of course -- but they <br/>\nmay not be stated, and thus not understood.  For instance, if your <br/>\nchild says something mean and disrespectful, you might say, &quot;Gee, <br/>\nthat really hurt my (or Bobby&#39;s, or whoever) feelings.&quot;  The child <br/>\nmight not realize that there is a consequence to that behavior, that <br/>\nnext time they want to do something that requires that person, that <br/>\nperson may be less inclined to want to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize this sounds rambly and incoherent.  Also, specific praise <br/>\nfor positive actions tends to be very helpful in increasing that <br/>\nbehavior.  &quot;Good job&quot; is kinda weak.... But &quot;I really appreciate how <br/>\nhard it was to tell the truth.  You probaby felt terrible when you <br/>\nbroke that priceless Ming vase, and were scared to tell me.&quot;  Also, <br/>\nwhen appropriate, share stories of when you did things.
