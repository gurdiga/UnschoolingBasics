We found the wolf mountain site when <br/>\nsearching a while back and someday when we visit CA (we&#39;re in MA) we <br/>\nplan to visit!   There&#39;s one here in MA but you have to be 18 to <br/>\nvolunteer (and 16 most other places to volunteer, animal shelters etc, <br/>\nliability I imagine), but from what I read, wolf mountain lets you <br/>\ninteract somewhat with the wolves.
