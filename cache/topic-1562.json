I asked him if he would be interested in <br/>\nturning it into a fun learning opportunity by getting trip-tiks and <br/>\nfollowing the trip on a map. Am I ruining the experience by <br/>\nsuggesting this? &gt; Jeanne<br/>\n<br/>\nNo you aren&#39;t ruining anything by suggesting this because it is only <br/>\na &quot;suggestion&quot; -which means there is a choice in it.  It can be <br/>\nchosen to do it the way you suggested, a way Mr B suggests, or <br/>\nneither.  It isn&#39;t mandentory.  There are choices. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy forcing a child to do something (I am talking schoolwork wise), <br/>\nlike writing a report about what they did on a fun outing will soon <br/>\nend with them not wanting to go on the fun outings if they don&#39;t want <br/>\nto do the writing, or painting or singing or whatever is demanded <br/>\nthat takes away from the &quot;just having fun&quot;.  That was all I meant.  I <br/>\nhave seen it happen.  Activities that kids really enjoyed when made <br/>\ninto work later, became a lost activity for the kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to let go and trust.  It isn&#39;t how we ps taught moms were <br/>\nprogramed.  :)  But it can be accomplished.  Provide writing journals <br/>\nfor each of them to use if they wish or not.  Provide the tools and <br/>\nthey will use them.  I promise you it will not be in the way we had <br/>\npreplanned in out minds, but in the way THEY see it planned in their <br/>\nminds-which is really what we want anyway.  Kids see things totally <br/>\ndifferent from us and from each other for that matter.  I think it is <br/>\nimportant to let them do it their way, using their own creativity and <br/>\nimaginations (and keeping our ideas and opinions out of it).  <br/>\nImitation is a way kids learn, so besides having the tools there (ie <br/>\nwriting journals) you too should have one and be the first to sit <br/>\ndown where they can see you, watch you, and imitate you and write in <br/>\nyour journal.  :)  Won&#39;t be long and the kids that are interested <br/>\nwill be sitting there writing in their journals too.  For the ones <br/>\nthat don&#39;t (or even if none of them have an interest) keep on <br/>\nwriting.  It may take time for them to decide they want to write and <br/>\nlike seeing you read a lot, they will pick up the same habit if it is <br/>\nan interest.  If it isn&#39;t an interest they have, then if you watch, <br/>\nyou will notice what their real interst is and can bask in the joy of <br/>\nknowing they have a different individual interest, even if it is <br/>\ndifferent than you wanted.  I hope some of that made sense.  lol!<br/>\n<br/>\nProvide the tools, let them see you following your interests, and <br/>\ntrust that they will do the same.  You may have writers, artists, or <br/>\nmusicians.  They will let you know what they need to persue their <br/>\npath of interest if you give them the chance.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Amanda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] gentler way of talking to kids","postDate":"1089367656","msgId":1645,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEMTNFNkE4LjI4RTQ2JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0M2QwMWM0NjU1ZSRjMTFkMjM2MCQ2NTAwYThjMEBMYXB0b3A+"},"prevInTopic":1638,"nextInTopic":1656,"prevInTime":1644,"nextInTime":1646,"topicId":1562,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
