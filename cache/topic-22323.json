It may also be making him feel singled out to <br/>\nbe the point of contention of this issue.  I doubt you intend to make <br/>\nhim feel like he&#39;s somehow less than everyone else, but I don&#39;t think <br/>\nhis old school is above that kind of tactic to put pressure on you.  <br/>\nYour choice not to vaccinate is for the benefit of your son&#39;s health, <br/>\nand fighting with his school about it isn&#39;t healthy for him or you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son seems to want to go back to school, consider the <br/>\npossibility that that desire is a reflection of all the chaos <br/>\nsurrounding the issue.  In his eyes, all of the tension and fighting <br/>\nwould stop if he could just go back to school.  I respect your wish <br/>\nto respect your son, and allow him to decide if he wants to go to <br/>\nschool, there is nothing wrong with that.  Because there *is* so much <br/>\ntension around this issue, give him some time to decompress, and keep <br/>\nthe people who are causing you problems away from him until he has <br/>\nhad that time.  It sounds to me like they are *using* your son and <br/>\nhis emotions to manipulate you. They can&#39;t be allow to do that, and <br/>\nif they wont stop, they need to stay away from him. That&#39;s hard when <br/>\nyou live so close to so many relatives, but they can&#39;t be allowed to <br/>\nbe hurtful to your son *even if they mean well*.  Act the same way <br/>\nyou would if they were abusing him in any other way: Remove your son <br/>\nfrom the situation, state your position on the issue, and give them <br/>\nthe space they need to decide if they want to make changes so they <br/>\ncan be part of your family&#39;s lives, or if they refuse to change at <br/>\nthe expense of their relationship with you and your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave faith in yourself and your son; it may take courage, but you <br/>\n*really do know what&#39;s best for him*!  <br/>\n<br/>\nDonna B.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Sara&quot; &lt;nurturinghome@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; in our journey in &#39;unschooling&#39; we are facing hard times!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; our families are giving us hard time, both my family and my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>husband&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; family.

If you do not agree that your dh&#39;s (husband&#39;s) brother has purchased the right to run your lives, don&#39;t let him move an inch down that path. And consider yourself warned that his help may be a bid for control over you, and refuse it in the future. No objects are worth that. I&#39;d be willing to bet that your being deaf is a little part of this, to the extent that controlling families will take any perceived weakness and use it to tighten the chains. My family is controlling, too... I know. The weakness in me which they exploit in the name of help is my chronic disorganization. <br/>\n   Your son must not be jerked around like this anymore. I have had to subtly teach my family that is they cause my children or me sadness they cannot have access to the kids.  I taught this in a way that works best for my family (since they aren&#39;t honest about not trusting me, and certainly don&#39;t see themselves as controlling, just &#39;wanting what&#39;s best for us&#39;).  I just refused invitations, became hard to find, did not invite them to my home. People like your family and mine do what thy do out of  FEAR. They think you are desperately wrong and that they must resue you and your children from this wrongness. My own parents acted like I was choosing to feed my son heroin. They grilled my kids on their knowlege and made my kids feel terribly insecure.  I regret letting them treat my kids that way one second, but as I had been raised to accept this control as love, and I do love them, that it took me a while to get it. Control is not love, it is negation of one&#39;s soul. X-ing a<br/>\n person out.<br/>\n   Find out the laws of your state, both about legal refusal of immunizations and about truancy and homeschooling. Remember that if your son is under the age of compulsory attendance that no educational law is relevant. Take control. Don&#39;t let your husband give up his job, don&#39;t move, don&#39;t send your son away. He is very young. He is YOURS. What you tell him about this is up to YOU, but this doesn&#39;t need to be discussed like it&#39;s an emergency with him.  For now you choose to learn at home....And hey, you can give him a bilingual education (if he is hearing, he&#39;ll learn to sign and speak I&#39;ll bet). God gave this child to you not to your parents!  You can do this!!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Sara &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nurturinghome@...\">nurturinghome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, March 19, 2007 1:00:09 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] still new with unschooling (long!)<br/>\n<br/>\nin our journey in &#39;unschooling&#39; we are facing hard times!<br/>\n<br/>\nour families are giving us hard time, both my family and my husband&#39;s<br/>\nfamily.

Based on it, I assume he is in reading level of first grade<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (he is 5 years old)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shalom is sad he was expelled from school and misses school. So<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sticking to &#39;unschooling&#39; principle, I would happily send him back to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school if the school will only let us! <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Our family researched for other schools and found other school in our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; area. But the principal in our school got angry as he googled and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; found my posting in myspace.  He tries to spread about us lies that we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are trouble makers, to ensure no other schools will want to accept<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shalom. His purpose is to get us to give up, then vaccinate Shalom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then beg them to accept him back to HIS school. Or simply to take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; revenge. I have no idea.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now no school wants to accept Shalom. We don&#39;t care. we would be happy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to unschool! But our son told me he misses school so much and wants to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; go back to school.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Our family are frantically calling all of the schools in the area<br/>\n&gt; &gt; begging them to let our son to any of them. We are not the ones to do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these calls! Once we visited my parents. my son asked us permission to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stay over my parents few days. We didn&#39;t mind as we knew my dad is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; good with music and he goes to differnt places that might interest our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; son.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So he stayed over my parents few days until we came to visit again in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the weekend. I saw a change in Shalom&#39;s behavior. He looks sadder and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has more temper tarnturms than he ever had before. I see fear in his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; eyes! <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Our parents lectured us about trying to meet various schools in their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; area even its 45 minutes - 1 hour away from our house. they offered us<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to leave Shalom in their house. (which doesn&#39;t make sense!! He has to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grow up in his parent&#39;s house not his grandparents!) They<br/>\n&gt; &gt; alternativelly offered he will be driven back and forth from school to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our home, (which will end him needing to wake up really early in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; morning to get on the ride, then returning very late like at 8 - 10<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pm! which again, doesn&#39;t make sense!!) When we pointed them these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; issues, my parents offered us to move to their area, even my husband&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; job is in our area, and the housing in their area is much more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expensive, and not to mention all of our friends are in our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; neighborhood and not in theirs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Then my parents got us meeting with the rabbi&#39;s wife (we are jews) in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the block. she also lectured us trying to persuade us to get him in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school in their area. She offered an idea about another school in our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; area. We told her that school was too stressfull, as we asked kids<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from there they weren&#39;t happy, she pooh poohed it and said Shalom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; needs a system, not being at home doing nothing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I felt terrible about all of the privacy invasion. Everyone says they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are only helping us. They don&#39;t realize their help is unwanted!!! they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t realize they are messing up with our sanity making us crazy!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They can offer help but not FORCE!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway when we prepared to go home, Shalom started screaming he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t want to go home. He started to panic and crying. When I asked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him what is the problem he sobbed saying that he has no school in our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; home, and he will have school in my parent&#39;s area. (then i found out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my dad took our son to a school without telling us, registering there,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; paying 600 dollars!) Then I realized he was brainwashed that being not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; schooled is a terrible thing. Shalom looks so scared and lost. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Our parents and family have no idea what they are doing to us!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When we took Shalom back home scraming and crying (knowing my mom will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tell my dad about this, then my dad will &#39;prove&#39; it as we are unfit to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be parents!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When we arrived home, my husband found out in his pager his brother&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; emails: His brother said in his emails: if you don&#39;t get your child<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back to a school in the next few days, I am going to report you to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; social workers that we are neglecting our child by not getting him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into a school system.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we were shocked and don&#39;t know what to do! We are feeling invaded! we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feel pryed and disrespected. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I guess his brother allows himself to do this to us, because he helped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us financially to buy our house and car instead of the car that broke<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; By the way a school that is in our area, another one a small one and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is more relaxed heared about us from more people, not from the school&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; s principal realized we are good people and not trouble makers so as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shalom is begging us to let him go to school, it might work out. If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shalom will change his mind and want to be unschooled, we will happily<br/>\n&gt; &gt; let him to be! <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe they are treating us this way because we are a deaf couple? <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So what are your advices for the legal issues with my husband&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; brother? about my and his family&#39;s invasing our lives? And how can I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; help my poor child who was probably lectured and brainwashed.. and he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is so unhappy and fearfull and stressfull!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; help!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thank you if you could read it all!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sara<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":103804653,"authorName":"rn9302000","from":"&quot;rn9302000&quot; &lt;rn930@...&gt;","profile":"rn9302000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: still new with unschooling  (long!)","postDate":"1174312142","msgId":22326,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV0bTRjZStmZTJtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGV0bGNkcCtmaWkyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22325,"nextInTopic":22328,"prevInTime":22325,"nextInTime":22327,"topicId":22323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sara, What state are you in?

I am truely shocked how they are trying to manipulate us into<br/>\n&gt; getting our son, Shalom back to school.<br/>\n&gt; If you remember me, its us whom the school expelled Shalom based on<br/>\n&gt; vaccination issues. more info is on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://myspace.com/nurturinghome\">http://myspace.com/nurturinghome</a><br/>\n&gt; in our blog under the subject &#39;our principal is trying to force us to<br/>\n&gt; vaccinate our son&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Shalom is still &#39;deschooling&#39; tending to look at movies in the<br/>\n&gt; computer he somehow learned to type in google videos, which requires<br/>\n&gt; reading. Based on it, I assume he is in reading level of first grade<br/>\n&gt; (he is 5 years old)<br/>\n&gt; Shalom is sad he was expelled from school and misses school. So<br/>\n&gt; sticking to &#39;unschooling&#39; principle, I would happily send him back to<br/>\n&gt; school if the school will only let us! <br/>\n&gt; Our family researched for other schools and found other school in our<br/>\n&gt; area. But the principal in our school got angry as he googled and<br/>\n&gt; found my posting in myspace.  He tries to spread about us lies that we<br/>\n&gt; are trouble makers, to ensure no other schools will want to accept<br/>\n&gt; Shalom. His purpose is to get us to give up, then vaccinate Shalom<br/>\n&gt; then beg them to accept him back to HIS school. Or simply to take<br/>\n&gt; revenge. I have no idea.<br/>\n&gt; Now no school wants to accept Shalom. We don&#39;t care. we would be happy<br/>\n&gt; to unschool! But our son told me he misses school so much and wants to<br/>\n&gt; go back to school.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Our family are frantically calling all of the schools in the area<br/>\n&gt; begging them to let our son to any of them. We are not the ones to do<br/>\n&gt; these calls! Once we visited my parents. my son asked us permission to<br/>\n&gt; stay over my parents few days. We didn&#39;t mind as we knew my dad is<br/>\n&gt; good with music and he goes to differnt places that might interest our<br/>\n&gt; son.<br/>\n&gt; So he stayed over my parents few days until we came to visit again in<br/>\n&gt; the weekend. I saw a change in Shalom&#39;s behavior. He looks sadder and<br/>\n&gt; has more temper tarnturms than he ever had before. I see fear in his<br/>\n&gt; eyes! <br/>\n&gt; Our parents lectured us about trying to meet various schools in their<br/>\n&gt; area even its 45 minutes - 1 hour away from our house. they offered us<br/>\n&gt; to leave Shalom in their house. (which doesn&#39;t make sense!! He has to<br/>\n&gt; grow up in his parent&#39;s house not his grandparents!) They<br/>\n&gt; alternativelly offered he will be driven back and forth from school to<br/>\n&gt; our home, (which will end him needing to wake up really early in the<br/>\n&gt; morning to get on the ride, then returning very late like at 8 - 10<br/>\n&gt; pm! which again, doesn&#39;t make sense!!) When we pointed them these<br/>\n&gt; issues, my parents offered us to move to their area, even my husband&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; job is in our area, and the housing in their area is much more<br/>\n&gt; expensive, and not to mention all of our friends are in our<br/>\n&gt; neighborhood and not in theirs.<br/>\n&gt; Then my parents got us meeting with the rabbi&#39;s wife (we are jews) in<br/>\n&gt; the block. she also lectured us trying to persuade us to get him in a<br/>\n&gt; school in their area. She offered an idea about another school in our<br/>\n&gt; area. We told her that school was too stressfull, as we asked kids<br/>\n&gt; from there they weren&#39;t happy, she pooh poohed it and said Shalom<br/>\n&gt; needs a system, not being at home doing nothing.<br/>\n&gt; I felt terrible about all of the privacy invasion. Everyone says they<br/>\n&gt; are only helping us. They don&#39;t realize their help is unwanted!!! they<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t realize they are messing up with our sanity making us crazy!<br/>\n&gt; They can offer help but not FORCE!<br/>\n&gt; Anyway when we prepared to go home, Shalom started screaming he<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t want to go home. He started to panic and crying. When I asked<br/>\n&gt; him what is the problem he sobbed saying that he has no school in our<br/>\n&gt; home, and he will have school in my parent&#39;s area. (then i found out<br/>\n&gt; my dad took our son to a school without telling us, registering there,<br/>\n&gt; paying 600 dollars!) Then I realized he was brainwashed that being not<br/>\n&gt; schooled is a terrible thing. Shalom looks so scared and lost. <br/>\n&gt; Our parents and family have no idea what they are doing to us!!<br/>\n&gt; When we took Shalom back home scraming and crying (knowing my mom will<br/>\n&gt; tell my dad about this, then my dad will &#39;prove&#39; it as we are unfit to<br/>\n&gt; be parents!)<br/>\n&gt; When we arrived home, my husband found out in his pager his brother&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; emails: His brother said in his emails: if you don&#39;t get your child<br/>\n&gt; back to a school in the next few days, I am going to report you to the<br/>\n&gt; social workers that we are neglecting our child by not getting him<br/>\n&gt; into a school system.<br/>\n&gt; we were shocked and don&#39;t know what to do! We are feeling invaded! we<br/>\n&gt; feel pryed and disrespected. <br/>\n&gt; I guess his brother allows himself to do this to us, because he helped<br/>\n&gt; us financially to buy our house and car instead of the car that broke<br/>\n&gt; down.<br/>\n&gt; By the way a school that is in our area, another one a small one and<br/>\n&gt; is more relaxed heared about us from more people, not from the school&#39;<br/>\n&gt; s principal realized we are good people and not trouble makers so as<br/>\n&gt; Shalom is begging us to let him go to school, it might work out. If<br/>\n&gt; Shalom will change his mind and want to be unschooled, we will happily<br/>\n&gt; let him to be! <br/>\n&gt; Maybe they are treating us this way because we are a deaf couple? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So what are your advices for the legal issues with my husband&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; brother? about my and his family&#39;s invasing our lives? And how can I<br/>\n&gt; help my poor child who was probably lectured and brainwashed.. and he<br/>\n&gt; is so unhappy and fearfull and stressfull!!<br/>\n&gt; help!<br/>\n&gt; thank you if you could read it all!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sara<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212820206,"authorName":"Jennifer Dion","from":"Jennifer Dion &lt;maggielou007@...&gt;","profile":"maggielou007","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] still new with unschooling  (long!)","postDate":"1174311791","msgId":22325,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3MTkwOC4xNjQ4MS5xbUB3ZWI1MDMwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGV0bGNkcCtmaWkyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22323,"nextInTopic":22326,"prevInTime":22324,"nextInTime":22326,"topicId":22323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sara Your story is heart breaking.
