We live in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1950000942\">My sister asked if we could watch her son for a week.  She is a <br/>\nsingle mother, works and he is out of school for one week before <br/>\ncamp begins.  We live in neighboring states.  My ds is almost 6; his <br/>\ncousin is turning 9 this week.  I understand and am empathetic to <br/>\nwhy his cousin acts out.  He can be overly aggressive in his play <br/>\nand he is sometimes even inappropriate when undressed. (I am not <br/>\nsure but at times I wonder if he was sexually abused by one of his <br/>\nolder foster brothers years ago.  I explored the topic with his <br/>\nmother but she has otehr explanations for his behavior.) <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have really worked hard as a family to get our ds to try to use <br/>\nhis words rather than act out pshysically (hit, push,etc).  I talked <br/>\nwith our ds to see if he was interested in having his cousin come.  <br/>\nHe loves palying with this cousin and was definite that he wanted <br/>\nhim here.  When I tried to talk with ds about my concerns of his <br/>\ncousin being too rough, my ds said that is his cousin, he doesn&#39;t <br/>\ncare.  (Our ds will alwasy minimize whenever he gets hurt <br/>\naccidently: falls, bangs himself, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am writing because I am finding it difficult to try to parent our <br/>\nds with an unschooling approach while having to make so many limtis <br/>\nwith this older, stronger, heavier, mroe aggressive and impulsive <br/>\nchild.  He doesn&#39;t respect limtis well and needs to be reminded <br/>\nfrequently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need some suggestions about how to handle this.  This cousin will <br/>\nbe here until Thursday.  My son is already unhappy that he is <br/>\nleaving and wants him to come back and stay over again.  Regardless <br/>\nof this visit, this is my sister&#39;s child and we will have contact <br/>\nwith them in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was molested by cousin(s) when he was a child.  We both <br/>\nfeel that we must watch them ALL the time.  We intervene when cousin <br/>\nis being to threatening or rough which happens quite a bit during <br/>\nthe day.  Cousin initiates pushing him and then my ds gets caught up <br/>\nin the &quot;game&quot;.  OUr ds continues to sleep in our bedroom at night so <br/>\nthey do sleep in different rooms in the evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease help me unschool in this situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanne<br/>\nLake Carmel, NY</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14876,"nextTopicId":15009}}
