There are lots of things about your parenting that I really appreciate (specify).  At the same time, there are things I&#39;d like to try doing differently.  I bet you didn&#39;t parent me exactly the way Grandma and Grandpa raised you!  I&#39;m looking for the things that help my family to be the best they can be, and I really find that the children are so much more helpful, cooperative, joyful (whatever your dad will most identify with:-) since we&#39;ve started doing X.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEasier for me to type than to say, I&#39;m sure:-)  But also remember, your Dad and Step-mom have 20-40 years more ingrained patterns than you do even.  It&#39;s a learning curve and they&#39;re going to fall back on their old behaviors when they don&#39;t know what else to do.  Depending on how concerned you are, it may mean not leaving your kids (or at least not more than one at a time) alone with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps,<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBe a PS3 game guru.<br/>\nGet your game face on with the latest PS3 news and previews at Yahoo!

To sum up the situation we are <br/>\na military family and my husband and I were raised in the deep <br/>\nsouth.  We live near my family at the moment and my parents have <br/>\nalways had a hand per say in helping with the kids when we are over <br/>\nthere.  In the past I&#39;ve never had a problem with it.........ok I&#39;m <br/>\njumping the gun sorry.  My dh is gone a lot, in fact he is on the <br/>\nother side of the country andhas been since the end of Dec.  We <br/>\npulled our son (who just turned 6 in Jan) out of public school back <br/>\nduring the holidays.  So this whole home/unschooling thing has <br/>\ntranspired since dh has been gone.  Now he comes back in 10 days.  I <br/>\nhave been keeping him abreast of all the changes in the family <br/>\ndynamics.  See I realized that we were very demanding and controlling <br/>\nof our kids (our dd is 3) and I was feeling like a tyrant always <br/>\nscreaming at the kids.  Not to mention everyone in the family always <br/>\nseemed completely stressed out and miserable!  So things have done a <br/>\ncomplete 180 here at home and I love the difference in our family.  I <br/>\ntruly believe that to unschool is the best decision for our family.<br/>\nOk now on to my questions/problems........see when dh is gone we are <br/>\nover at my parents house maybe 2-4 days a week.  After I explained <br/>\nhow my family talks to each other, how it&#39;s all about respect (both <br/>\nways), and how I don&#39;t want us to raise our voices at the kids all <br/>\nwas going well.  Then today the kids stayed over at my parents house <br/>\nfor the day and when I picked them up my son said something that <br/>\nreally bothered me....&quot;Mimi told me that there are snakes and spiders <br/>\nbehind her flower bushes that will eat me!!!&quot;  He was truly worried <br/>\nand rightly so.  I asked my step-mom why she said this and was told <br/>\nbecause he wouldn&#39;t stay from behind them and kept asking why should <br/>\nI?  She got frustrated that he was questioning her so she told him <br/>\nthis story.
