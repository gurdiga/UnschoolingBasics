I am in the process of trying to change my thinking.  I choose to get married and have a family, and I even choose to be a traditional housewife, because that is what I truly wanted to do.  And, then, somewhere along the line, I started resenting all tasks that were involved.  Mainly, because I see them as &quot;have to&#39;s&quot;, instead of &quot;want to&#39;s&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been focusing on doing things from a place of Joy instead.  When I get tired, which is when I get whinny, I choose to let things go and do them another time.  I am finding that when I do this, I actually enjoy the task more later and am actually getting more done in the long run.  I&#39;m also learning that half a task done, is better than none of the task done.  This is a big one for me, because I tend to have that &quot;all or nothing&quot; thinking, which prevents me from getting a lot of projects started!<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy C.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve found, in my own experience that the more I do for Simon and for Linnaea and for David the more they do for me.

I will relay what I did and then I welcome folks writing back with suggestions of how I might have handled it differently.  I did try to handle the situation by respecting the girls and not threatening, etc.  But, I also do not want to start a habit of &quot;every time we leave our bikes out Mom will take care of it for us.&quot;  I did think of not doing anything and just using natural consequences, but that just felt mean spirited.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I gently reminded them a couple of times that it was going to rain and that bikes needed to be put away.  They both went in the house to watch TV and be on the computer, while hubby and I were still outside.  I went inside to do something for a few moments and gently reminded again.  I also said quietly to each child, without nagging or lecturing,  &quot;When bikes get wet, they rust.&quot;  When each child was ready to put her bike away, I went outside with her while she did it.  (Neither of my girls like to be outside by herself.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI realize I probably over reminded, since that is a form of nagging.  My question is though, should I, after reminding once and giving the information about bikes rusting, let it go?  Then still be ready to go outside with them when they are ready to take care of it.  Is it OK to let the bike sit out and get wet, if they don&#39;t.  My older daughter&#39;s bike was brand new last fall and wasn&#39;t cheep.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know some would say I should have done it for them, since I would appreciate someone doing that for me, if I had forgotten.  And, I get that perspective.  But, if I do it every time, what are they learning from that?  I have been picking up toys in the living room more, but I figure I&#39;m doing that for me, because I like a clean living room.  I don&#39;t do it every day, but at least a few times a week.  I do at times remind them that if they leave stuff out, it might get stepped on and broken, even if people are trying to step over or around it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m open to suggestions.  I&#39;m still trying to figure out how to be more gentle with them, without doing everything for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy C.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":46477013,"authorName":"Ulrike haupt","from":"&quot;Ulrike haupt&quot; &lt;rica@...&gt;","profile":"ulrikehaupt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: putting bikes away - advice welcome!","postDate":"1273449597","msgId":43918,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGhzN2djays3MnU5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43914,"nextInTopic":43927,"prevInTime":43917,"nextInTime":43919,"topicId":43884,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Amy Isn t this fun?

I&#39;m still a little uncomfortable with it, except that I have noticed them spontaneously helping with other things from time to time, and that feels nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On May 8, 2010, at 10:56 AM, AECANGORA@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But, I also do not want to start a habit of &quot;every time we leave our  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; bikes out Mom will take care of it for us.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s what parents think kids are thinking but it&#39;s not how kids&#39;  <br/>\n&gt; brains work.

If you wake up and realize that it is not put up and got wet, you can wipe it down with a dry towel and spray WD-40 on the chain and any other moving part that might get a little out of whack if it gets a little wet. My biggest concern is to make sure that the bike is not left in the driveway where it can get run over. In those instances, I ask the girls to get the bikes out of the driveway and into the grass. If they don&#39;t, I will do it for them and let them know that I did it. It is usually something along the lines of, &quot;Hey, you forgot to move your bike so I put it up on the porch for you.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My question is though, should I, after reminding once and giving the information about bikes rusting, let it go?

If they don&#39;t do anything, I would let it go and either do it for them or remind them later. I don&#39;t always remember to do everything I am supposed to do. I forget to put the clothes in dryer all the time. It would stink if somebody constantly nagged me and told me that I needed to remember to put the clothes in the dryer because if I don&#39;t, they will mildew. If I leave them in there forever, yes, they will mildew. If I forget them overnight or for a little bit, I have the option of rewashing them. You are making an illogical leap by saying that they will rust. They will not rust instantly. It takes a lot of water exposure for a bike to rust. When I was a kid, I used to love riding through mud muddles. I even liked trying to ride in the rain when I could get away with it. When my bike got all muddy, I would hose it down. I don&#39;t remember drying it or taking any kind of special precautions. I would have to spray my chain from time to time but that was it. I feel like you are over reacting and trying to scare them into compliance. If you change your perspective about how horrible it is to leave your bike out, perhaps that will help you to have a more balanced perspective and approach. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But, if I do it every time, what are they learning from that?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They are learning that you love them. I would hate it if my husband had that attitude with me about all of the little things that I forget or don&#39;t get to do in a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n__._,_.__<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG - www.avg.com <br/>\nVersion: 9.0.819 / Virus Database: 271.1.1/2861 - Release Date: 05/08/10 01:26:00<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] putting bikes away - advice welcome!","postDate":"1273335651","msgId":43888,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4MjA2Ny4yNDQ0OS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDQ0JDRDVDNzk0RkYzMi0xOTU4LTE0ODU3QHdlYm1haWwtbTA1MC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDhDQ0JDRDVDNzk0RkYzMi0xOTU4LTE0ODU3QHdlYm1haWwtbTA1MC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43886,"nextInTopic":43890,"prevInTime":43887,"nextInTime":43889,"topicId":43884,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If your husband left a tool outside and you were still out, or if you go out again to do something and saw it , would you have called him out to take care of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-820597898\">If your husband left a tool outside and you were still out, or if you go out again to do something and saw it , would you have called him out to take care of his tool or would you have lovinngly put his tool away for him????<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"Karen Swanay &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] putting bikes away - advice welcome!","postDate":"1273331423","msgId":43886,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlsVXNHdTBxMEJ1MHJGLVhLdzNCMGVLQ0pvSEpIQTJIT1o0cnlfU0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDQ0JDRDVDNzk0RkYzMi0xOTU4LTE0ODU3QHdlYm1haWwtbTA1MC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDhDQ0JDRDVDNzk0RkYzMi0xOTU4LTE0ODU3QHdlYm1haWwtbTA1MC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43884,"nextInTopic":43888,"prevInTime":43885,"nextInTime":43887,"topicId":43884,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"True story...two times this week, my 13 yr old has left the milk out overnight on the counter.

(They he and the 11 yr old have a late night<br/>\neating habit.)  Anyway, I got up and put the milk away the first time.  When<br/>\nhe woke up I reminded him he left it out and that was it.  This morning,<br/>\nonce he gets up again, I&#39;ll remind him again he did it again.  The reason<br/>\nfor the reminding is two fold.  First, my husband who is less into the<br/>\nunschooling thing than I am wants an over the top reaction and I&#39;d rather<br/>\navoid that.  So I&#39;ll remind the boy so the husband feels there has been some<br/>\nelement of &quot;punishment&quot; for the infraction.  The other reason is that I<br/>\nforget things and I want to be reminded so eventually I&#39;ll stop forgetting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCome to my house after I&#39;ve baked...often you&#39;ll find the oven still<br/>\ngoing...cooking nothing.  That&#39;s my fault.  I forget.  The more I&#39;m reminded<br/>\nthe less likely I am to forget.  BUT I want someone to say &quot;Hey, you are<br/>\nbaking nothing again!&quot;  AND shut it off.  Not call me in with the intention<br/>\nof shaming me or &quot;If you have to get up and do it then you&#39;ll be more<br/>\ncircumspect about not forgetting next time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYour girls forgot.  Right now you are doing a lot for them, but you know,<br/>\nwhen they were born you changed their diapers and when they were potty<br/>\ntraining you wiped their butts and I bet you never thought &quot; I know you are<br/>\nonly 6 months old but if I change this poopy diaper for you you&#39;ll never<br/>\nlearn!&quot;  Putting things away is a learned behavior.  If a very young child<br/>\nis overly neat and concerned with everything in it&#39;s place that&#39;s a child<br/>\nwith OCD tendencies and should be watched.  Children are entropy.  But they<br/>\ngrow out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI say put the bikes up.  A &quot;Hey ladies, I stuck your bikes in the garage for<br/>\nya!&quot; said WITHOUT shaming or the intent to modify their behavior will<br/>\neventually make an impression.  My boys are in the throws of puberty.  I<br/>\nthought I might have to remind them that deodorant was not optional anymore<br/>\nand that it was to be a daily occurrence for the rest of my life but it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t.  They finally have it.  Your girls will get it.  It&#39;s just not time<br/>\nyet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n&quot;Correlation does not imply causation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a<br/>\nnail.&quot; Abraham Maslow<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, May 8, 2010 at 9:56 AM, &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AECANGORA@...\">AECANGORA@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know some would say I should have done it for them, since I would<br/>\n&gt; appreciate someone doing that for me, if I had forgotten.

I will relay what I did and then I welcome folks writing back with suggestions of how I might have handled it differently.  I did try to handle the situation by respecting the girls and not threatening, etc.  But, I also do not want to start a habit of &quot;every time we leave our bikes out Mom will take care of it for us.&quot;  I did think of not doing anything and just using natural consequences, but that just felt mean spirited.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I gently reminded them a couple of times that it was going to rain and that bikes needed to be put away.  They both went in the house to watch TV and be on the computer, while hubby and I were still outside.  I went inside to do something for a few moments and gently reminded again.  I also said quietly to each child, without nagging or lecturing,  &quot;When bikes get wet, they rust.&quot;  When each child was ready to put her bike away, I went outside with her while she did it.  (Neither of my girls like to be outside by herself.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI realize I probably over reminded, since that is a form of nagging.  My question is though, should I, after reminding once and giving the information about bikes rusting, let it go?  Then still be ready to go outside with them when they are ready to take care of it.  Is it OK to let the bike sit out and get wet, if they don&#39;t.  My older daughter&#39;s bike was brand new last fall and wasn&#39;t cheep.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI know some would say I should have done it for them, since I would appreciate someone doing that for me, if I had forgotten.  And, I get that perspective.  But, if I do it every time, what are they learning from that?  I have been picking up toys in the living room more, but I figure I&#39;m doing that for me, because I like a clean living room.  I don&#39;t do it every day, but at least a few times a week.
