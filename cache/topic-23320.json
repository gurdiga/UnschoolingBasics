He&#39;d pick all kinds of things, based on the picture on the cover, <br/>\nmostly,  and then he&#39;d color or paint on the pages or paste stuff on them or <br/>\nignore it after a brief look. &lt;g&gt;   We had a pretty weird collection of <br/>\nstuff in those days. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he liked Zoobooks, but he&#39;s always loved and been interested in animals. <br/>\nAs he got older he drew a lot of pictures of animals and he referred to that <br/>\nmagazine a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe at two your little guy would like catalogs just as much.
