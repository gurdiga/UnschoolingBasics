My oldest is Alisha is 15 the Adrian 13  Addison almost 8 and Natalia 6.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The first two were born in a hospital and second two at home. My eldest has struggled all he life with school a I did. At the age of nine I seriously thought of home schooling yet I didn&#39;t know how, I researched a lot and met many home schoolers through my home birhts and felt the inner calling of knowing this for me was the way it was meant to be.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My second child Adrian is Autistic and I was having a lot of challenges and and then at that time a toddler and baby . I thought to myself I must be crazy thinking I cant do this I&#39;m  a hormonal mess and have my own healing journey that gives me the strength to hold all that I do, this would only make it worse for everyone.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So I made a second choice Waldorf. It  was good for a while for my oldest until she got a real dogmatic teacher and Having all Indigo children they tend not to conform very well much to the teachers dismay.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My youngest son said why do they talk to us  like babies around here.  The youngest one has been doing very well at Waldorf but she loves all the kinds of stuff that they offer it kind of her normal interests anyways, and she only in kidegarten where waldorf just plays..<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My autistic child is in a public school  where there really pushing him because he really high functioning . He said why do I have to go to school when threres everything we need to learn in nature or I just like to fix things.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Right now I am getting my BA in psychology and trans personal psychology based on A course in miracles.  So a lot of has been about  are healing journey so that we can be congruent when were helping others heal.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  One of the things that always comes up for me is how the school system ruined so much of my being and not having the support at home either was a double whammy.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I was very much an expiertial learner loaded with creativity and they did  not teach the way I learnded so I always thought I was very stupid.That I didn&#39;t measure up.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I know will all my kids and the different variations of Indigo I have in my home has always concerned me what do I do thats best for them.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I feel like I cant run from the truth of wanting to be congruent in all areas of my life and this one area is the biggest of them all, my children.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have all the fears screaming at me how can you do this, your too hormonal to be with your kids all the time, You don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  YOu need your space , how are going to do your school work, its to late the damage is done and there&#39;s nothing you can do.  I am afraid  I sound selfish.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I don&#39;t have a clue when two want to go for a nature walk and two donthow I will work this, they all have such different needs.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  What if I fail and screw them up even more than the school has and choices I have  too?????<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I need some strong encouragement with some ideas.
