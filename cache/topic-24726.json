Episodes end with a town meeting in which the kids award one child a gold star worth $20,000, all leading to the grand finale, with an unimaginable test, the biggest awards and a special surprise for every child.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  It goes on to describe how the kids will be broken up into 4 categories  laborer, cook, merchant, upper class -- with jobs decided by showdowns, kid against kid to determine each childs paycheck and role. The kids in the video are wearing bandannas with a particular color by their class. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  It&#39;s set and being filmed just up the road from us, between San Felipe Pueblo and Santa Fe, in an old mining ghost town from the 1880&#39;s called Bonanza City. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I wont be watching it  first, Im not a fan of reality TV -- second (or maybe first) there were several crying kids just in the promo video clip. Kids screaming at each other, one little girl who said &quot;I&#39;m a beauty queen -- I don&#39;t do work.&quot;  Later in the clip, the same girl says &quot;the upper class is king and queen.&quot;  By the end of the clip, that little girl is crying at a town meeting while the other kids tell her she can&#39;t punish them.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Remember, tho, these are school kids with all controls lifted for a desperate period of 40 days, away from their families, homesick and afraid.  It probably makes for great &#39;reality TV&#39; but it sounds and looks just too painful to watch.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nChoose the right car based on your needs.
