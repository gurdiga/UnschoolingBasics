It is common to clip some or all of the hair in some pets to make it more effective. These baths will also remove infected hairs that can be the source of an infection to people or other animals.   Specific anti fungal cremes are also used when a pet is infected in an area that already has sparse hair growth, or there are small, discrete lesions.   Oral anti fungal medications are also used in select cases. They have the potential to cause side effects, so their use is confined to specific situations.   In some pets the disease may resolve by itself. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Dermazol or Selsan Blue Shampoo and itraconizole will reduce the lesions and may cure the disease. Serious cases require itraconizole therapy or diflucan therapy. <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n   1. Shaving affected areas to remove as many fungal spores as possible.    (Ive heard shaving actually causes it to spread that cutting the hair away from the area is better....)  <br/>\n   2. Vacuum areas where cat tend to spend time. Wash bedding.   <br/>\n   3. Your vet may have you apply an anti fungal cream or lotion if there is only 1 or 2 spots.   <br/>\n   4. If there are multiple affected areas, a systemic antifungal will probably be prescribed. I usually use griseofulrin. It must be given with a fatty meal and can never be given to pregnant cats since it can cause birth defects.   <br/>\n   5. If your cat has an impaired immune system (is feline leukemia or FIV positive, for example), treating ringworm will be much more difficult. Kittens have more trouble with ringworm than adult cats, simply because their  immune systems are immature. Longhaired cats such as Persians will sometimes act as carriers, who can spread the infection with no obvious signs. <br/>\n  Topical therapy serves more to limit environmental contamination than effecting a cure. It is an important aspect of decreasing contamination in the environment and infecting other individuals. Clipping cats prior to topical treatments has been suggested but is controversial. Great care is required not to contaminate the environment with the spores shed from the clipping and therefore, any grooming should be done in an isolated area. Also, clipping should be coarse to minimize the spread of the spores over the patient. Topical treatment consists of  either shampoos or creams. These products contain disinfectants such as lime sulfur, povidone iodine, chlorhexidine or imidazole agents that are specifically antifungal. <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hope this helps...........<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Becca<br/>\n<br/>\njenjon1964 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:amparo0914@...\">amparo0914@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Hi everyone,<br/>\nI hope you can all help me.
