You have helped me see that I am doing what I <br/>\ncan to facilitate my children&#39;s interests. I do provide a lot of art <br/>\nmaterials and my son does play with them when he wants. He painted a <br/>\nbeautiful painting of yellow the other day, his fave color.

We <br/>\nhave CDs at home that my son can listen to whenever he wants. He <br/>\nloves to dance and I love watching him dance. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m slowly learning that I am creative in my thinking. I never <br/>\nthought of myself as that way before but I&#39;m pretty good at thinking <br/>\noutside the box. It drives my husband batty, who does everything by <br/>\nthe book just because that&#39;s the way it&#39;s done. hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has also got me thinking more about my interest in art. I do <br/>\nremember hating school field trips to the Smithsonian art museum. <br/>\nSomehow those trips took all the fun and enjoyment out of the art. <br/>\nAnd, as if once wasn&#39;t bad enough, I think I had to go every year <br/>\nfrom around 5th grade on. Art doesn&#39;t move me like it moves some <br/>\npeople. I took an art class in the 8th grade. I don&#39;t remember being <br/>\ndiscouraged about my work. I vaguely remember that I did well in the <br/>\nclass. I do remember, though, that I found it very boring because it <br/>\nwas so techinical. I just wanted to paint a picture.

And I DID have a  <br/>\ntraumatic experience with art, in school, in 4th grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I want to say that it is worth it to get over it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet another chance to heal, to fill a gap in ourselves, through  <br/>\nparenting our own children.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a good start is to focus on bringing the world of art to them by  <br/>\nnoticing what they notice. I remember we were in a shopping mall,  <br/>\nonce, and my oldest daughter mentioned something about the store  <br/>\nfronts - how you could often tell what kind of merchandise was going  <br/>\nto be inside the store, by what the design of the outside of the store  <br/>\nwas. What she said was  that it felt weird to her if the outside of  <br/>\nthe store didn&#39;t &quot;go with&quot; what was inside. HUH? I&#39;d have NEVER even  <br/>\nnoticed anything like that. So - we walked around the mall, looking at  <br/>\nstore fronts and guessing what was inside and then checking. Got ME to  <br/>\nfocus on &quot;design&quot; in a way I never had before and, ever since that  <br/>\nday, I&#39;ve had a sort of sweet fondness for beautifully (and  <br/>\naccurately) designed store fronts (facades?).  That was my little toe  <br/>\nstepping into the waters of a growing appreciation of architectural  <br/>\ndesign as art.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay some music in the car - try LOTS of different kinds and, instead  <br/>\nof focusing on whether you like it or not, focus on your kids&#39;  <br/>\nresponse to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is kind of like playing &quot;warmer and colder&quot; - do more of things  <br/>\nthat are warmer, less when the response is colder.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to museums for quick trips - just find something interesting, enjoy  <br/>\nit, and then leave. Make these visits short and sweet. My kids, as  <br/>\nyoung adults, are now HUGE art museum lovers. I&#39;m really pleased for  <br/>\nthem to have this in their lives. But, amazingly, &quot;I&quot; am now also an  <br/>\nart lover - and that was an unexpected side-effect of unschooling.

So is my husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut our three kids are VERY &quot;arty.&quot; I&#39;m not sure how that happened  <br/>\nother than that we really kept supplying them with materials,  <br/>\nexperiences, encouragement to pursue their own interests, and that is  <br/>\nthe direction their interests went.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did have a LOT of materials around - tons of paper, markers,  <br/>\ncrayons, paints, chalk, brushes, scissors, yarn, string, hole  <br/>\npunchers, popsicle sticks, fabric, thread, beads, needles, wooden  <br/>\nthingies, buttons, glitter, glue guns, glue sticks, white glue,  <br/>\n&quot;stiffy&quot; glue, and on and on and on. Lots of homemade playdough. I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t think it mattered so much what the materials were - they were  <br/>\nalways just things that we picked up at garage sales, thrift stores,  <br/>\nor the art or craft stores. Wander around in Michaels or another craft  <br/>\nstore - if the kids are interested, they&#39;ll see &quot;projects&quot; they might  <br/>\nwant to do. We kept lots of magazines around - they did a lot of  <br/>\ncollage-making while watching tv or listening to books on tape or to  <br/>\nmusic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was all &quot;free play&quot; - we didn&#39;t do very many predetermined crafts.  <br/>\nThe kids &quot;made messes&quot; mostly! (That&#39;s from other peoples&#39; points of  <br/>\nview, not ours.) Most of those creative materials were always  <br/>\navailable for them to use in their pretend play - indoors or outdoors.  <br/>\nGet some really good materials, too, for drawing and coloring and  <br/>\npainting -- because there is a great joy in using high quality stuff -  <br/>\nlike PrismaColor colored pencils. They are expensive, so we took  <br/>\nbetter care of them, the kids valued them and still have their large  <br/>\nboxes of PrismaColor pencils, used so much that they are only an inch  <br/>\nor so long, now.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could have fun looking through and ordering a lot of cool stuff  <br/>\nfrom the Dick Blick art supplies catalog.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the kids were young, we went for very quick trips to lots of  <br/>\nmuseums, art galleries, stopped by the art department at the college  <br/>\nwhere I teach, paused to look at paintings or photographs hanging in  <br/>\npublic places (like some MacDonalds have local artwork in them).<br/>\n<br/>\nRoya (23) is an artist - ceramics, painting, drawing and she knits and  <br/>\ncrochets - designs her own stuff. Roxana (20) doesn&#39;t create visual  <br/>\nart of her own, but she is in Paris for three months and has a pass to  <br/>\nthe Louvre where she goes every time she has a spare couple of hours.  <br/>\nAnd I&#39;m impressed by the artistry of the photographs she&#39;s been taking  <br/>\nwhile living in Europe. Rosie (17) makes latch-hook rugs - she buys  <br/>\nthe kits. She also crochets and knits.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus - all three of them sing a lot. Roxana performs a lot in  <br/>\nmusicals. Rox and Rosie both are into dancing and acting, too. We go  <br/>\nto the theater a LOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of the development of all this arty side of life required me to  <br/>\nteach them anything. It was all exposure and enjoyment and free play.  <br/>\nWhen they got older - into their mid-teens, they started wanting more  <br/>\nformal experiences. Roya enrolled in a ceramics class at the community  <br/>\ncollege and continued with that for years. She joined a college vocal  <br/>\nensemble and performed with them for a couple of years. Roxana and  <br/>\nRosie take community college courses in musical theater, acting,  <br/>\ndance, and technical theater like lighting design and stage make-up.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mar 19, 2008, at 4:50 AM, keetry wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want my children to go down the &quot;mainstream&quot; path when they<br/>\n&gt; go out on their own but I would have no idea how to help them pursue<br/>\n&gt; a lifetime of art.

It is such a wonderful symphony of connections and growth and change. Oh, I can wax quite lyrical about evolutionary biology. Simon and Linnaea know a lot about the workings of the natural world because David (an evolutionary anthropologist) and I (another evolutionary anthropologist) are so in love with what we know, and excited by it, and often stunned by it. And we talk about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an art to science. There is a creativity inherent in biology. They aren&#39;t separate things. In the preface to Richard Dawkins&#39; book Unweaving the Rainbow he says; <br/>\n<br/>\n   My title is from Keats, who believed that Newton had destroyed all the poetry of the rainbow by reducing it to the prismatic colours. Keats could hardly have been more wrong, and my aim is to guide all who are tempted by a similar view towards the opposite conclusion. Science is, or ought to be, the inspiration for great poetry,...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, there is beauty in symmetry and there is amazement in discovering that symmetry is a marker of health and the ability of the individual to overcome environmental insults. It is a wonderous thing to see how the beauty we find in the symmetrical is based on reproductive drive. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust like with all things unschooling, don&#39;t separate the scientific from the artistic. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m reaching clarity here, but really, there is a lot of overlap between the two.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: keetry &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keetry@...\">keetry@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 19 March, 2008 11:50:45 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: mainstream path lurker<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;patrick morris&quot; <br/>\n&lt;katinandrea@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; certainly hope for a fun arty ride but do question if my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>motivations<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; lack a more practical bent. <br/>\n&gt; patrick<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot; We spend and too often waste a lifetime walking in the shadow of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>our<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ultimate unclaimed self.&quot; (from &#39;a beam of intense darkness&#39;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is non-arty mainstream?

I am not creative in an arty way at all. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.:) Here&#39;s what I mean by that...<br/>\nsome people are naturally more abstract in their thinking, full of<br/>\ncolor and pictures. Some people are more logical and concrete full of<br/>\nquestions and reason. We all have varying degrees of interests and<br/>\ntalents and natural leanings. We don&#39;t all need to be artists, that&#39;s<br/>\nfor sure!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I believe that humans are born creative and expressive. It&#39;s not<br/>\nabout how they express that part of themselves, it&#39;s more important<br/>\nthey feel free to do so. You might express your creative self by<br/>\nsolving a complex scientific problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are all creative forces, we all need to express who-we-are in some<br/>\nmanner. That&#39;s part of being human in my opinion. I guess the question<br/>\nI would have for you is when did you decide you weren&#39;t an artist? Is<br/>\nthis something you enjoyed as a child? Colors, textures and design<br/>\nseem to be pretty natural for young children and they decide at some<br/>\npoint they aren&#39;t &quot;good enough&quot; or the ridicule and comparison they<br/>\nreceive shuts them down to even attempting art.<br/>\n<br/>\nArt is (at it&#39;s best) free expression. Not rules and &quot;how to&quot; and step<br/>\nby step. It&#39;s manipulating colors or materials in a way that makes you<br/>\nfeel good, that expresses something within you!<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, some people won&#39;t find as much satisfaction doing those sorts<br/>\nof activities and that&#39;s ok. But music and art and writing belong to<br/>\nall humans, they don&#39;t belong exclusively to artistic types. Those<br/>\nforms of expression are ultimately about human connections to<br/>\nme....not about whether you&#39;re the next Picasso or Mozart or Thoreau!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that with children, you only need have a variety of<br/>\nmaterials available and they will find ways to create with them just<br/>\nfine. If we can approach art and other activities with the heart of a<br/>\nyoung child, I believe we can find joy in the simple exploration of<br/>\nsuch things. Watch them, they are young scientists about<br/>\nit...observing, experimenting, analyzing, making conclusions etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ask yourself if you don&#39;t do those things simply because you have<br/>\nzero interest in them, or if you don&#39;t do them because you&#39;re afraid<br/>\nto explore them (or shut down to the idea of being artistic). Because<br/>\nit matters.  It&#39;s one thing if you aren&#39;t interested, it&#39;s another<br/>\nthing entirely if you&#39;re avoiding them the way I used to avoid math!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"&quot;Karen Swanay&quot; &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: mainstream path lurker","postDate":"1205929921","msgId":31102,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwMzE5MDUzMmg1YmY2MTY5ZXQ4ZjM1OGM0MjAwYmEzMDMxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZycXZrMitiYmR1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZycXVtbCttNmI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ZnJxdmsyK2JiZHVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":31101,"nextInTopic":31103,"prevInTime":31101,"nextInTime":31103,"topicId":31073,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ********************************************************************************************** I don t know, you know, because I m so new to this and I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-679077317\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is non-arty mainstream?

I *do* think that to a certain degree, either nature,<br/>\nnurture or both, that kids take on the desires of their parents<br/>\nnaturally.  Well some do.  I am an animal nut.  I began working with<br/>\nanimals when I was 12.  I&#39;ve been a zookeeper, a large animal trainer,<br/>\na dog trainer, groomer, vet tech, and now I work with aggressive dogs,<br/>\nusing +P methods, helping to change the culture of force and<br/>\npain-based training for these dogs.  Both of my kids like animals.<br/>\nOne of my kids likes them as I do.  I didn&#39;t force it on him, I just<br/>\nthink he saw my passion and watched my involvement and it either<br/>\nstruck a chord in him or he took on what he saw.  Will he go into<br/>\nanimal behavior when he&#39;s older?  I don&#39;t know.  But I don&#39;t think<br/>\nit&#39;s necessary for me to pretend to be something I&#39;m not for him or<br/>\nfor him to pretend to an interest he doesn&#39;t have you know?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you aren&#39;t artsy, OK.  Are your kids?  Do they even seem<br/>\ninterested?  Maybe they&#39;d much rather spend time at a museum than<br/>\ngluing macaroni to paper plates.  I think that&#39;s OK.  Not everyone has<br/>\nthe interest in everything else, and certainly not everyone has the<br/>\ntalent.

Forgive me if I have<br/>\nmissed something, I haven&#39;t been following this entire conversation,<br/>\nbut I wanted to chime in.  I don&#39;t necessarily think taking a<br/>\nmainstream path is a bad thing.  I think being able to make informed<br/>\ndecisions regarding the paths we take would be more important.  My son<br/>\nloves mainstream sports.  Since he is unschooled we feel that he is<br/>\nbetter prepared to make decisions regarding whether he sticks to his<br/>\nsport or not.  He&#39;s very competitive.  Something I learned last<br/>\nweekend.

If your children want more art in their lives, or you<br/>\nwant to expose them to more art.  I don&#39;t see a problem with planning<br/>\nat all.  Just don&#39;t be rigid in your plan.  Many times when we start<br/>\nsomething arty, the kids take off on their own.  And BTW they may not<br/>\npursue a lifetime of art.   I don&#39;t think art is a &quot;prerequisite&quot; to<br/>\nunschooling.  It&#39;s something that many children enjoy (i think kids<br/>\nare naturally creative) and unschooling provides the perfect scenario<br/>\nfor children to be and stay creative.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Is non-arty mainstream?
