Help as needed. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre you asking because you need to prove something to the government or out of your own concerns? If there are legal hoops to jump through, you might do better with a local list to find out common strategies used by people in your area. If its that this is something you&#39;re worried about, personally, step back a bit. Learning isn&#39;t the direct, linear progression school likes to pretend. Real learning happens because ideas swirl around and connections are made. You can&#39;t create make it happen.

Some people catch on to spelling quickly and easily. Others learn to spell more slowly, over years, as words catch their eye. I&#39;m one of the latter sort. I&#39;m an avid reader and writer and yet I&#39;m not a very good speller at all! I&#39;ve learned to spell words one at a time, here and there, as I notice them, but I use a Lot of words! So it has taken me decades to learn to spell some of them, and I&#39;m by no means done (still can&#39;t spell apology or satelite for instance... I think one of those is right... maybe). <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter writes for pleasure regularly - a couple times a week - and doesn&#39;t have great spelling, but her spelling is about as good as a friend of hers, a year older, with daily writing and spelling exercises. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your daughter wants to know how to spell something, tell her. Period. Don&#39;t have her look it up. Don&#39;t have her guess or sound out. Just tell her. If she&#39;d rather, write it out for her. That&#39;s all. No tricks, lessons or daily writing plan, just tell her what she wants to know. If she Wants more, by all means show her how to use a spell checker or dictionary (or spelling dictionary), but don&#39;t push those. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;that&#39;s why I came here for ideas!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m afraid you may be in the wrong place! this isn&#39;t a place to get &quot;how do I teach my child X without it looking like teaching&quot; information, its a place to get some ideas of what learning looks like without teaching, so you can relax a bit and spend time with your kids without fussing about their spelling. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you step back and watch your daughter draw comics and play with words on her own terms, you&#39;ll See how she learns to spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"s.waynforth@btinternet.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"1"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Writing Ideas","postDate":"1319485500","msgId":47616,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTk0ODU1MDAuOTE4MDEuWWFob29NYWlsUkNAd2ViODczMTEubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PFNOVDE0My1XNDM5QkJBNDU4OTNCREY5NDE1RTU2REY3RUYwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PDEzMTk0NTQwNzQuNjEyMTIuWWFob29NYWlsQ2xhc3NpY0B3ZWIxNjE3MDYubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPiw8MDkxNjdFNEEtODkwNi00MTg3LTk2MTktODU1Njc3MkJBMjlBQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8U05UMTQzLVc0MzlCQkE0NTg5M0JERjk0MTVFNTZERjdFRjBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":47615,"nextInTopic":47617,"prevInTime":47615,"nextInTime":47617,"topicId":47603,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Of course that was your daughter s solution.

Writing <br/>\nproficiency probably appears pretty early on in the list. The truth is that <br/>\nwriting isn&#39;t a huge aspect of my or my children&#39;s day to day lives. I type far <br/>\nmore than I write and so do they. If I were to insert more writing into their <br/>\nlives it would be my emphasis and not the life that any of us is leading. How <br/>\noften do you write? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, however, the need is part of their lives I have no doubt that they will do <br/>\nwhat they need to do to get their skills up to whatever par is required. When I <br/>\nwas 7 I went to a Holt inspired school that didn&#39;t focus on skill and instead <br/>\nwas about exploring the world and learning as you went. I went for two fabulous <br/>\nyears and I would have continued forever, but my dad became disturbed by the <br/>\nidea that his money was making me exempt from the experiences of less moneyed <br/>\nchildren. The summer between the two schools my mom bought a bunch of those <br/>\nnotebooks with dashed lines in the middle and we wrote stories together to bring <br/>\nmy writing skills up to the levels required by the less enlightened school ;0). <br/>\nWithin three months of not particularly diligent work on my and my mom&#39;s part I <br/>\nwas up to snuff. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting is a tool. Why work to use a tool when you don&#39;t need it or want it? <br/>\nMost of writing is hand - eye coordination. Lots of things will  make that <br/>\nconnection so that when it comes to writing more, better she will have better <br/>\nability to do so. Linnaea draws a lot and doodles. She has a hard time not <br/>\ndrawing. When she writes it is fairly clearly. Simon, who doesn&#39;t doodle or draw <br/>\nvery much, if ever, writes as clearly as Linnaea. The other day we were trying <br/>\nto see how small each of us could write something and, while mine was the <br/>\nsmallest, Simon&#39;s was a very close second. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Tova &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ml_ja@...\">ml_ja@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, 24 October, 2011 3:08:28<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Writing Ideas<br/>\n<br/>\nI was hoping to get some ideas on ways for my 10 year old daughter to <br/>\nincorporate more writing into her life.
