We build up definitions slowly over time by encountering words  <br/>\nin several contexts.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And, really, that applies to everything.

We come up with theories,  <br/>\ntest them against real life, refine the theories when the don&#39;t quite  <br/>\nwork.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve dabbled in learning Japanese over the years. By listening to  <br/>\nsentences repeated over and over I can spit them back but 90% of it&#39;s  <br/>\njust rote. The two words I&#39;ve really gotten a feel for are  <br/>\n&quot;sumimasen&quot; (excuse me) which I&#39;ve heard on Heroes and in several  <br/>\nmovies. That word jumps out from a jumble for me. By seeing how and  <br/>\nwhen it&#39;s used, I&#39;m building up a feeling of it&#39;s meaning piece by  <br/>\npiece. (What I mean is, though it can be translated as &quot;excuse me&quot;,  <br/>\nit isn&#39;t always used in the same contexts English speakers would use  <br/>\n&quot;excuse me&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other word is &quot;ohayo&quot;. On the tapes I hear &quot;konnichiwa&quot; and  <br/>\n&quot;ohio&quot; in the same context: in the car at various times of the day.  <br/>\nWhat nailed ohayo and gave it true meaning was hosting a Japanese  <br/>\nstudent for 3 weeks who would great a crowd of  friends each morning  <br/>\nas we dropped them off for class with &quot;Ohayo!&quot; and they&#39;d all respond  <br/>\n&quot;Ohayo!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter was 11 we were reading a book and the narrator  <br/>\nproudly announced that the town clock frequently told the right time.  <br/>\nAt 11 she&#39;d certainly heard the word frequently before. And she had  <br/>\nbuilt up a feeling for its meaning. But in that context she needed a  <br/>\nprecise definition to get the joke. So I told her. There, the  <br/>\ndefinition helped because 1) she already had a good handle on the  <br/>\nword and how it was used and 2) she wanted the definition for a  <br/>\nspecific purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some things to turn over about how people learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":248259402,"authorName":"RLR","from":"&quot;RLR&quot; &lt;rlr@...&gt;","profile":"rrlrr2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Vocabulary Game","postDate":"1204849166","msgId":30592,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBlNjQwMWM4N2ZlOCRlN2U5NWQzMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBSU1NWTWFpbj4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZxaXNwZytwNjQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30523,"nextInTopic":30599,"prevInTime":30591,"nextInTime":30593,"topicId":30347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s me again with the latest bane of my life.

So I am wondering how I could<br/>\napproach this, in a knowlegeable non aggressive way...Id like to *not*<br/>\ntest if this is possible....and if dd must test, then Id like to do it<br/>\nat home, at least.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, in NC, we are required to test.

And by administer, I mean I give the<br/>\n&gt;  test by my rules, no one else&#39;s: I don&#39;t set a timer, I help, we do<br/>\n&gt;  the questions together if they want.

However, italy does<br/>\nnot use standardized tests yet.  If they did, she probably wouldnt be<br/>\nso scared either, she likes workbookish type questions and<br/>\nanswers...mainly because she thinks they are funny (she wonders how<br/>\nthey think up such stupid questions)...<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever it will most likely be the usual stuff a dictation, a<br/>\ncomprehension for reading, some math all with the teachers there (whom<br/>\nshe has a real fear of...)<br/>\n<br/>\nId like to manage this somehow to turn it into a non issue--of course<br/>\nthe best hope is dialogue with the principle...which I am due to do<br/>\nthis week---<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And I ask you - when else is that the case?

(clever use of<br/>\n&gt;  operate - didja catch that?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lol, yes! and it is so true.  especially absurd for a 7 or 8 year old.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  OK, sorry - back to the question.

Does it have to be given by<br/>\nsomeone else? Here, in NC, we are required to test. Not to pass the<br/>\ntest, just to give it and have the results on file. I&#39;ve always<br/>\nadministered the test myself. And by administer, I mean I give the<br/>\ntest by my rules, no one else&#39;s: I don&#39;t set a timer, I help, we do<br/>\nthe questions together if they want. (shh. don&#39;t tell anybody that<br/>\nlast one) There&#39;s no text anxiety, &#39;cause it&#39;s just a piece of paper<br/>\nto fill out. Of course, the official recommendation is to have someone<br/>\noutside your family give the test, with it being timed, with no<br/>\nresources. And I ask you - when else is that the case? When is someone<br/>\ncompletely alone, with no resources except what they remember? Testing<br/>\nis bizarre. Well, sure - a surgeon, I wouldn&#39;t really want her in the<br/>\noperating room clicking on google - but that&#39;s at *such* a different<br/>\nlevel than most folks operate in, in their daily lives. (clever use of<br/>\noperate - didja catch that?)<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, sorry - back to the question. We are also not required to test<br/>\nuntil they&#39;re required to register as a homeschooler, at age 7. 5 is<br/>\nyoung! So - my question - what are the legal requirements (not<br/>\nrecommendations) where you live? Maybe we can see how to work within<br/>\nthose parameters.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nCaren<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://openheartedlife.blogspot.com/\">http://openheartedlife.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":316471425,"authorName":"Erin Crouchman","from":"Erin Crouchman &lt;ecrouchm@...&gt;","profile":"ecrouchm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Testing in the school board","postDate":"1204388551","msgId":30371,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2MDgyMC40MDQzNi5xbUB3ZWI0NTIxMi5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGZxYnRpNCtucTBoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30367,"nextInTopic":30385,"prevInTime":30370,"nextInTime":30372,"topicId":30347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks SO much, Ren!
