I am continuously learning more horrifying things about the public<br/>\nschool system, like the fact that 2/3 of high school graduates are not able<br/>\nto pass the GED.  Also, at the time I was working and couldn&#39;t stay home to<br/>\nhomeschool her.  I felt that kindergarten was harmless enough and would give<br/>\nher some social contacts that I had failed to give her.  She has been<br/>\nwanting to go to school ever since her older (half-) sister started school.<br/>\nMy oldest lives with her dad and we have her most weekends and for summer<br/>\nvacation.

I have 5 kids, 3 <br/>\nwithin 3 years of each other and they share bedrooms.  We have to <br/>\nhave some kind of routine because the kids have trouble remembering <br/>\nnot to be too loud or too rambunctious to not wake the other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is a difference between routine and absolute rules.  I <br/>\nknow families where the kids are in bed by 8:00 no matter what.  My <br/>\nyounger ones are usually in bed by 9:00 but not if they have a tv <br/>\nshow they really want to watch or we have company or they fell <br/>\nasleep at dinnertime or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think unschooling is looking at the situation and working with <br/>\nwhat is really happening.  My now 5yo gets really cranky by supper <br/>\ntime.  She would cry and whine about every real or imagined slight.  <br/>\nSo I looked at things that helped her sleep and suggested those or <br/>\ngot those moving during the afternoon.  Example:  she loves to sleep <br/>\nin my bed so I might suggest if she wanted to  take her blanket into <br/>\nmy room and listen to the radio since she seemed tired.  She loves <br/>\nto cuddle with her oldest sister so I would ask her if she wanted to <br/>\nwatch a movie with Adriane (after I had already checked with <br/>\nAdriane).  She would happily drift off to sleep and the entire house <br/>\nwas happier.  If all else fails, I would do reflexology on her feet <br/>\nand off she goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.---who still after 6 years can&#39;t get a handle on the food <br/>\nthing &lt;sigh&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100027905,"authorName":"TreeGoddess","from":"TreeGoddess &lt;treegoddess@...&gt;","profile":"odrade7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] bedtimes","postDate":"1110900298","msgId":5074,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlhY2YyZDYwNjU3MTdhZTU4ZjZlYjc4ZWM5MTU1Yjc2QGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PE1HRUxKTUNKRkhQTUZDQU5HSU9LSUVOSERQQUEudGVtYWlyQGFkZWxwaGlhLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PE1HRUxKTUNKRkhQTUZDQU5HSU9LSUVOSERQQUEudGVtYWlyQGFkZWxwaGlhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":5073,"nextInTopic":5075,"prevInTime":5073,"nextInTime":5075,"topicId":5048,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Judy, It s sometimes hard to get naps in when you have younger children that are pretty close in age.

It&#39;s replaced with a whole <br/>\nphilosophy that will help you figure out what to do with your <br/>\nparticular children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a matter of learning to trust that kids understand their needs <br/>\nbetter than we do. It&#39;s a matter of learning that many of the things we <br/>\nthink are right and important to make them do or stop them from doing <br/>\nare what are causing them to act as though they can&#39;t be trusted.<br/>\n<br/>\nConventional parenting is oriented towards molding kids into what we <br/>\nwant them to be. Presumably we want good things for them! Like being <br/>\nkind, learned, honest, safe. But to get those good things conventional <br/>\nparenting methods put huge strains on the relationship between parent <br/>\nand child. And we accept that the strain is normal and natural. It&#39;s <br/>\nnot uncommon for a conventional parent to say something to the effect <br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t care whether you like me or not. It&#39;s not my job to be liked. <br/>\nI want you to get up and do your homework.&quot; Or be in before midnight. <br/>\nOr stop listening to that raunchy music. Not being liked sometimes, <br/>\nmaking kids cry, making them really pissed off at us on occasion seems <br/>\nto be part of the price we need to pay to raise good kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what if unschoolers said the bad parts weren&#39;t necessary? What if <br/>\nunschoolers said they had kids who were kind, learned, honest and safe <br/>\nand all the other good stuff we want but it was accomplished without <br/>\ncontrol and without the subsequent fights against the control?<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people would immediately come up with all sorts of scenarios <br/>\nwhere kids need forced and assume we&#39;re sacrificing our kids health and <br/>\nsafety to avoid making them mad.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that isn&#39;t so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first step is to turn off the voice in your head that says &quot;That <br/>\ncan&#39;t possibly work,&quot; and ask questions as though it did work. :-) <br/>\nRather than assuming that kids won&#39;t eat, won&#39;t brush their teeth, <br/>\nwon&#39;t turn off the TV, won&#39;t sleep assume that they do and ask how. <br/>\nRather than assuming that it works for us because our kids are <br/>\nnaturally good and naturally do all the right things, assume we have <br/>\nregular kids who would behave as yours do if they were controlled. <br/>\nRather than assuming kids need protected from various things, ask how <br/>\nwe help them be safe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I know that I can&#39;t be doing too<br/>\n&gt; much wrong because everyone tells me what wonderful, happy children I <br/>\n&gt; have.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And if something seems to be working people will rarely see a need to <br/>\nchange!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut lots of time we&#39;ve learned to accept the bad parts of what we&#39;re <br/>\ndoing as just the way things need to be so we don&#39;t notice the bad <br/>\nparts. Parents accept that kids will be mad at them and will be sad. It <br/>\nseems justified that a little anger and sadness is the price they and <br/>\nwe need to pay for something we know is even better.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it doesn&#39;t have to be that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we assure ourselves they&#39;ll get over their upsetness.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in reality every time we pull the &quot;I know what&#39;s best for you card&quot; <br/>\non them, we chip away at the relationship between us. And the more we <br/>\nchip, the wider the gap between us becomes. Chipping away at the <br/>\nrelationship is like whacking a big tree with an ax. The stronger the <br/>\ntree, the less likely it will break. But the ax damages the tree even <br/>\nif it doesn&#39;t fall and even if the wounds heal over. The difference, of <br/>\ncourse, is that we can&#39;t always see the damage that we&#39;ve done to <br/>\nchildren. We may only realize it when they&#39;re teens and they aren&#39;t <br/>\nspeaking to us or as adults when they move far far away. And even then <br/>\nwhen we did everything we were &quot;supposed&quot; to, it&#39;s more likely we&#39;ll <br/>\nblame them as being bad or ungrateful than that we&#39;ll see how we pushed <br/>\nthem away.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone once characterized relationships like deposits and withdrawals. <br/>\nEvery time we do something that builds a closer relationship it&#39;s a <br/>\ndeposit. Every time we do something deliberately -- even if it feels <br/>\njustified -- to hurt them, it&#39;s a withdrawal. If we extend the <br/>\nprinciples of unschooling -- trust and respect -- into parenting we can <br/>\nminimize the withdrawals and actively work at the deposits.

What if he got frustrated with your lack <br/>\nof enthusiasm with his meals and wished you would just stop it and eat <br/>\nproperly what he cooked?<br/>\n<br/>\nA big part of unschooling is trusting kids. Their tastes are different. <br/>\nTheir needs are different. Sometimes they&#39;ll tell us things that don&#39;t <br/>\nseem to make sense, like they&#39;re hungry 10 minutes after they&#39;ve eaten. <br/>\nBut if we learn to trust them and respond with respect, the more <br/>\nthey&#39;ll learn about themselves and the more we&#39;ll learn about who they <br/>\nare and the better we can help them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was little, my daughter used to eat just about anything. When <br/>\nshe was about 4 her tastes started shutting down. There were just a few <br/>\nfoods that she&#39;d eat and she&#39;d get tired of those. And then when she <br/>\nwas 11 her tastes started opening up again and now at 13 she&#39;ll try <br/>\njust about anything and eats a wide variety of foods. The change wasn&#39;t <br/>\nbecause I made her eat a wide variety. It was just body chemistry. It <br/>\nwas like for 9 years she lived in a world where nearly everything <br/>\ntasted like liver and she hated liver. And having people get frustrated <br/>\nwith her for not enjoying a wider range of foods didn&#39;t make the liver <br/>\ntaste wonderful. It was just a life of liver *and* frustrated people.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we treat kids as though their problems were deliberate attempts to <br/>\nmake our lives more difficult we add frustration and uncaring to a <br/>\nproblem they are struggling with and have no idea how to solve.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we can&#39;t solve their problems. But the least we can do is be <br/>\nsympathetic and try to see what life is like living as they do with the <br/>\nneeds and lack of skills and lack of control that they do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do you help your children recognize when they need sleep?  From <br/>\n&gt; birth<br/>\n&gt; mine have all refused to acknowledge that they are tired even as their <br/>\n&gt; eyes<br/>\n&gt; droop and their heads fall.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perfectly normal :-) Even for adults. If there&#39;s something really <br/>\nexciting going on adults will fight off sleep too. And for little kids <br/>\nlife is exciting so they don&#39;t want to miss a moment. But they don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to be tired either.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you ease them into winding down.  Find a routine they find soothing <br/>\nand begin that when you notice they&#39;re getting tired. (Not to the point <br/>\nof being too wound up to wind down.) For instance turn the lights down <br/>\nlower. Put on soft music or story tape. Rock with them. Read to them. <br/>\nDo calming things that will relax them. Hold them and talk about their <br/>\nday and about tomorrow. Have a family bed. Tell them stories. Set up <br/>\nthe environment so it feels like they won&#39;t be missing out on things if <br/>\nthey go to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t a specific thing to do that will work for all kids. The <br/>\ngoal is to associate pleasant things with going to bed. If bedtime is a <br/>\nnegative thing, a time of fighting against control to be in bed at a <br/>\nspecific time, fighting against being separated from their parents, <br/>\nthey&#39;ll fight even harder. Against both being controlled and against <br/>\nthe unpleasant associations with going to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe none of those will work with your kids. Which is why it&#39;s hard to <br/>\ntell someone what to do instead. But when you&#39;re committed to helping <br/>\nthem get what they want, when you understand that they aren&#39;t trying to <br/>\nmake your life more difficult, you will want to do what you can to help <br/>\nthem find ways to be peaceful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I set a time for them because they haven&#39;t shown me that they<br/>\n&gt; will sleep for themselves.

The hard part is they can seem like the <br/>\nsame thing but when a parent decides a child needs to sleep, to the <br/>\nchild it doesn&#39;t feel like the same thing at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you got tired in the middle of the afternoon and your husband <br/>\ngot irritated with you mentioning it so decided you had to take a nap <br/>\nat 3 everyday? Would it feel like he was helping you? Or would it feel <br/>\nlike he was just trying to get rid of an annoying problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing made to do something, even something that someone thinks is right <br/>\nfor us, is maddening whether we&#39;re children or adults. And children <br/>\nhave the same feelings of anger and irritation that adults do when <br/>\nthey&#39;re treated like that. And yet we think kids are good when they do <br/>\nwhat others think is right for them but adults with that same trait are <br/>\nwimps.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if, instead, your husband took the kids out in the afternoon? Or <br/>\nlet you sleep in in the morning? Or brought you a cup of your favorite <br/>\nhot beverage while he played with the kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we identify the problem and impose a solution on it, then <br/>\nimplementing the solution then becomes a problem. The problem is no <br/>\nlonger a tired child but making someone take a nap.<br/>\n<br/>\n*BUT* I wouldn&#39;t recommend starting letting go of control with sleep <br/>\nissues!

Once you&#39;re committed to <br/>\nhonoring and respecting and trusting your children, it will be worth <br/>\ngoing through the transition from strict bedtimes to helping them get <br/>\nto sleep when they&#39;re tired.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177920469,"authorName":"Maria Dorian","from":"&quot;Maria Dorian&quot; &lt;mariadorian@...&gt;","profile":"pazinhim","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: structure?????","postDate":"1110892063","msgId":5059,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQxNm1tdit1cTh2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDNkY3MzNFQkM3QzA1NC1GRUMtMkNDREBtYmxrLXIzNi5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":5054,"nextInTopic":5060,"prevInTime":5058,"nextInTime":5060,"topicId":5048,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kelly, first and foremost, I said, Well, said .

Maybe she hasn&#39;t read much on radically unschooling and <br/>\njust jumped in with her views?  Not sure, either way, you shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nget upset.  You did a wonderful job explaining how REAL unschooling <br/>\nis in comparison to how she parents.  Also, maybe she is a Christian <br/>\n(but maybe not) which would explain how she might not want her kids <br/>\nto watch certain shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou made some great points and because I&#39;m about to leave for work, <br/>\nI just don&#39;t have time to pick them out word for word like you <br/>\ndid.   But, I really agree with you!  My kiddos, I feel watch t.v. <br/>\nall day.  Cartoons 98% of the time.  The way we as parents get our <br/>\ntime to watch t.v. (we only have one) is we say, &quot;Alright, now it&#39;s <br/>\nmom and dad&#39;s turn to learn something!&quot;  Never once do they <br/>\ncomplain!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the food thing, I was raised with controled meal times.  This <br/>\nfor me has turned into a weight problem because I always feel I <br/>\nshould eat when there&#39;s food in front of me, even if I&quot;m not <br/>\nhungry.  And, I&#39;m used to eating past full, just to clear my plate.  <br/>\nFrom the get go, we have raised our kids to ask when they are hungry <br/>\nfor me to feed them.  That snack idea that you do was a great idea.  <br/>\nAfter they are fed, if they only eat two bites, great!!  <br/>\nWonderful!!  I know that I will never have to worry about them <br/>\nhaving the kind of problems in that area that I have.  And, because <br/>\nwe are unschoolers and HOME with them EACH and everyday, pretty much <br/>\nat all time, we technically are eating together as a family all the <br/>\ntime.  I might be reading while my son is eating lunch but we are <br/>\nstill eating together aren&#39;t we?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, many more points you made were right on to unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell said!!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaria<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, kbcdlovejo@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Maria Dorian &lt;mariadorian@h...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tue, 15 Mar 2005 03:57:56 -0000<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Intro and structure<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well said, Judy!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maria<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, not exactly.<br/>\n&gt; This is a list for those looking to make the leap to unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; This doesn&#39;t even come close to helping others understand how <br/>\nunschooling works.<br/>\n&gt; First of all, the mom who responded doesn&#39;t have a child over age <br/>\nfive. <br/>\n&gt; So, she really isn&#39;t technically an unschooler. Her only &quot;school <br/>\nage&quot; child is in<br/>\n&gt; kindergarten.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s also assuming the worst of her children from the get-go.  <br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s still controlling what they do. She&#39;s assuming that they <br/>\nwill not<br/>\n&gt; chose healthful foods or sleep when they are tired or wake when <br/>\nthey are rested <br/>\n&gt; or ever turn off the tv.<br/>\n&gt; Well, let&#39;s look at her points:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-Perhaps I am seeing this issue only from my experience with <br/>\nmy own children.<br/>\n&gt; My children are 5 and under.  Their birthdays are in April.  <br/>\nLauren (2 yo)<br/>\n&gt; gets incredibly cranky by dinnertime if I don&#39;t make her take a <br/>\nnap.  Moira<br/>\n&gt; (5 yo) is quite happy to stay up until 1 am, and often does when <br/>\nwe have our<br/>\n&gt; friends over every other weekend for table top gaming.    I am not <br/>\nyet<br/>\n&gt; unschooling and Moira is in kindergarten, so she has to be up in <br/>\ntime to get<br/>\n&gt; on the bus, which means she has to go to bed by a certain time <br/>\nevery night<br/>\n&gt; to get enough sleep.  I do let them lay in bed reading (or looking <br/>\nat the<br/>\n&gt; pictures) for as long as they like every night.  Usually they are <br/>\nall asleep<br/>\n&gt; within an hour.  On weekends I am far more lax.  They get to stay <br/>\nup later<br/>\n&gt; and they can get up whenever they feel like, but Lauren is <br/>\npredictably up<br/>\n&gt; between 6 and 6:30 every morning.-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; Children are NOT unschooling. So sleep patterns are school-<br/>\ndetermined. NOT natural.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-My girls could (and have) convince(d) anyone that I <br/>\nstarve them within a<br/>\n&gt; half hour of eating a huge meal.  I feel strongly that family <br/>\nmeals are an<br/>\n&gt; important opportunity for parents to model good manners and for <br/>\neveryone in<br/>\n&gt; the family to connect and socialize, so eating meals together is a <br/>\nmust for<br/>\n&gt; me. -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; Have you asked your children what *they* think? <br/>\n&gt; Why do you think they aren&#39;t full after a huge meal? Maybe because <br/>\nYOU are <br/>\n&gt; telling them when they should be full or hungry? <br/>\n&gt; Samll children have small stomachs. They don&#39;t NEED huge meals!<br/>\n&gt; You might want to listen to them a bit more.<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=- Snacks are far more casual and can be eaten within a broad <br/>\ntimeframe<br/>\n&gt; (not within an hour of dinner so that they don&#39;t take one bite and <br/>\nsay they<br/>\n&gt; are full), and can be eaten pretty much anywhere except upstairs <br/>\nin their<br/>\n&gt; bedrooms.  I do regulate what they can eat because I feel strongly <br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; good nutrition and if left on their own, they will see nothing <br/>\nwrong with<br/>\n&gt; eating junk food all day.-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; Sandra has pages of &quot;If I let&quot; quotes from moms over the years: <br/>\nTake a look:<br/>\n&gt; www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling/ifilet<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s really important to be able to take a bite and say that <br/>\nyou&#39;re full. It REALLY <br/>\n&gt; is! If you *are*.<br/>\n&gt; As for &quot;junk&quot;---I keep platters of pears and cheese and grapes and <br/>\n&gt; carrots and muffins and other wholesome foods within reach all <br/>\nday. I <br/>\n&gt; also have a big bowl of M&Ms or jelly beans in the den. We have <br/>\ncookies and <br/>\n&gt; ice cream available all the time. My boys, at nine and 17, are <br/>\njust as <br/>\n&gt; likely to fix a quesdilla as they are to reach for the chips. <br/>\nMaybe MORE so,<br/>\n&gt; because they&#39;ve been given that choice for so long and they  know <br/>\nhow <br/>\n&gt; different foods make them feel.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-As for the TV, I let them watch as close to all they want <br/>\nas is reasonable.-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; Who decides what&#39;s reasonable?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-My husband has shows he likes to watch in the late morning, <br/>\nso after the<br/>\n&gt; girls have watched 4 hours of TV, it is his turn.  And that is how <br/>\nwe view<br/>\n&gt; it.  Whenever multiple people want to use the same thing but <br/>\ndifferently,<br/>\n&gt; they have to take turns and share.  TV is the same way in our <br/>\nhouse.-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Maybe you need more than one tv? That way everyone can be happy <br/>\nand not <br/>\n&gt; *just* the person with the TV.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-Sometimes, though, I will shut it off and not let anyone <br/>\nwatch for a little<br/>\n&gt; bit because I grew up without a TV and having it on *all* the time <br/>\ndrives me<br/>\n&gt; batty.  I have to have some quiet in the house sometimes.  That is <br/>\nmy turn<br/>\n&gt; with the TV.  :)-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt; Creepy.<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-When I don&#39;t take my turn, the rest of the family has it<br/>\n&gt; on from 6 am to 10 or 11 pm.  Lauren will sometimes watch TV for a <br/>\nwhile,<br/>\n&gt; then get up and shut it off and go do something else, usually <br/>\nplaying with<br/>\n&gt; her sister Rowan (12 mo).  The first time I saw that I was <br/>\nshocked.  I had<br/>\n&gt; never seen a child voluntarily shut off the TV.-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Maybe because your viewing was controlled as a child?<br/>\n&gt; Our children seem to only watch when there&#39;s something interesting <br/>\non. <br/>\n&gt; They regularly turn it off to do other things. Amazing? No. <br/>\n&gt; Expected when it&#39;s not limited.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-I see my role of parent as being that of provider and <br/>\nprotector.  I see a<br/>\n&gt; lot of emphasis on provider in all the info I have found on <br/>\nunschooling, but<br/>\n&gt; the protector part seems to be overlooked, at least in what I have <br/>\nfound.-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; Right. We&#39;re all out to make sure harm comes to our children. The <br/>\nmore <br/>\n&gt; dangerous, the better.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-There is a reason why humans rear their children for <br/>\nroughly two decades,<br/>\n&gt; instead of leaving them to their own devices from day one like <br/>\nreptiles do.-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; And now we&#39;re leaving them to their own devices? And being <br/>\ncompared to crocodiles????<br/>\n&gt; How long have you been reading here?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-I need to protect my children from making foolish decisions <br/>\nthat will cause<br/>\n&gt; themselves pain or harm, and so I step in and give them the <br/>\nbenefit of my<br/>\n&gt; experience and wisdom. -=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; See, I choose to help my children make wiser decisions (and allow <br/>\nthem to make <br/>\n&gt; a few mistakes---which we call learning-takes) NOW rather than <br/>\nhave all their <br/>\n&gt; decisions made FOR them and then turn them loose at 18 with no <br/>\nreal handle on <br/>\n&gt; how to weigh those decisions.<br/>\n&gt;  -=-=-=-Wow, that sounds really condescending, but I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think of a better way to phrase it right now.-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; Yes, it does. To us AND to your children.<br/>\n&gt;  -=-=-=-At such a young age, my<br/>\n&gt; children don&#39;t have the experience or knowledge to make decisions <br/>\nabout what<br/>\n&gt; kinds of food to eat.  The relationship between diet and health is <br/>\ntoo<br/>\n&gt; abstract for them right now.  It is easier to relate too much <br/>\nsugar to an<br/>\n&gt; upset tummy than it is to relate the fact that you don&#39;t have the <br/>\nflu that<br/>\n&gt; is going around to the fact that you take cod liver oil every <br/>\nday. -=-=-=<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Huh?<br/>\n&gt; See, I feel that the honest relationship between me and my <br/>\nchildren is MOST important.<br/>\n&gt; I trust when they say they&#39;re hungry or when they&#39;re full. <br/>\n&gt; And cod liver oil every day prevents the flu??? That&#39;s a fact? <br/>\nCall the AMA!<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=- Lauren still doesn&#39;t really grasp the idea that she gets <br/>\ncranky by 5 or 6 pm<br/>\n&gt; because she didn&#39;t take a nap.  Then she has temper tantrums and <br/>\nmisbehaves<br/>\n&gt; and gets yelled at for it and everyone is miserable.  She doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; getting yelled at, we don&#39;t like yelling, and it all could have <br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; prevented with a simple nap.-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s TWO?  There&#39;s a whole lot more to it than that.<br/>\n&gt; If allowed to learn when she needs sleep, she will nap when she is <br/>\ntired.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Then she has temper tantrums and misbehaves<br/>\n&gt; and gets yelled at for it and everyone is miserable.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; This one just makes me sad for that little girl. She gets yelled <br/>\nat for being tired???<br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s blamed for making everyone miserable? She&#39;s TWO!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-I hope this clarifies my position on &quot;structure&quot;.-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; No. It does clarify why you *think* you need to control your <br/>\nchildren. <br/>\n&gt; But that has nothing to do with structure.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; You might want to read more about unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly, who is usually more forgiving and <br/>\n&gt; patient on this list.

Her only &quot;school age&quot;<br/>\nchild is in<br/>\n  kindergarten.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She&#39;s also assuming the worst of her children from the get-go.<br/>\n  She&#39;s still controlling what they do. She&#39;s assuming that they will not<br/>\n  chose healthful foods or sleep when they are tired or wake when they are<br/>\nrested<br/>\n  or ever turn off the tv.<br/>\n  Well, let&#39;s look at her points:<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-Perhaps I am seeing this issue only from my experience with my own<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n  My children are 5 and under.  Their birthdays are in April.  Lauren (2 yo)<br/>\n  gets incredibly cranky by dinnertime if I don&#39;t make her take a nap.<br/>\nMoira<br/>\n  (5 yo) is quite happy to stay up until 1 am, and often does when we have<br/>\nour<br/>\n  friends over every other weekend for table top gaming.    I am not yet<br/>\n  unschooling and Moira is in kindergarten, so she has to be up in time to<br/>\nget<br/>\n  on the bus, which means she has to go to bed by a certain time every night<br/>\n  to get enough sleep.  I do let them lay in bed reading (or looking at the<br/>\n  pictures) for as long as they like every night.  Usually they are all<br/>\nasleep<br/>\n  within an hour.  On weekends I am far more lax.  They get to stay up later<br/>\n  and they can get up whenever they feel like, but Lauren is predictably up<br/>\n  between 6 and 6:30 every morning.-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n  Children are NOT unschooling. So sleep patterns are school-determined. NOT<br/>\nnatural.<br/>\n<br/>\n  **** My children&#39;s sleep habits were not determined by school until a few<br/>\nmonths ago.  What I described is what happened *before* Moira started<br/>\nschool.  Also, I am not comfortable going to bed while my children are still<br/>\nup and about.  Therefore, I make sure I put them to bed before I go to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-=-My girls could (and have) convince(d) anyone that I starve them<br/>\nwithin a<br/>\n  half hour of eating a huge meal.  I feel strongly that family meals are an<br/>\n  important opportunity for parents to model good manners and for everyone<br/>\nin<br/>\n  the family to connect and socialize, so eating meals together is a must<br/>\nfor<br/>\n  me. -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n  Have you asked your children what *they* think?<br/>\n  Why do you think they aren&#39;t full after a huge meal? Maybe because YOU are<br/>\n  telling them when they should be full or hungry?<br/>\n  Samll children have small stomachs. They don&#39;t NEED huge meals!<br/>\n  You might want to listen to them a bit more.<br/>\n<br/>\n  **** I believe my children are full when they tell me they are full.  If<br/>\nthey tell me that they are full and ten minutes later are asking for more to<br/>\neat because they are starving, then either they have unnaturally fast<br/>\nmetabolisms or they are lying to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=- Snacks are far more casual and can be eaten within a broad<br/>\ntimeframe<br/>\n  (not within an hour of dinner so that they don&#39;t take one bite and say<br/>\nthey<br/>\n  are full), and can be eaten pretty much anywhere except upstairs in their<br/>\n  bedrooms.  I do regulate what they can eat because I feel strongly about<br/>\n  good nutrition and if left on their own, they will see nothing wrong with<br/>\n  eating junk food all day.-=-=-=-<br/>\n  Sandra has pages of &quot;If I let&quot; quotes from moms over the years: Take a<br/>\nlook:<br/>\n  www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling/ifilet<br/>\n<br/>\n  **** I am merely saying what I have seen them do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s really important to be able to take a bite and say that you&#39;re full.<br/>\nIt REALLY<br/>\n  is! If you *are*.<br/>\n  As for &quot;junk&quot;---I keep platters of pears and cheese and grapes and<br/>\n  carrots and muffins and other wholesome foods within reach all day. I<br/>\n  also have a big bowl of M&Ms or jelly beans in the den. We have cookies<br/>\nand<br/>\n  ice cream available all the time. My boys, at nine and 17, are just as<br/>\n  likely to fix a quesdilla as they are to reach for the chips. Maybe MORE<br/>\nso,<br/>\n  because they&#39;ve been given that choice for so long and they  know how<br/>\n  different foods make them feel.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-As for the TV, I let them watch as close to all they want as is<br/>\nreasonable.-=-=-<br/>\n  Who decides what&#39;s reasonable?<br/>\n<br/>\n  **** Reasonable is letting others have turns too. I thought I explained<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-My husband has shows he likes to watch in the late morning, so after<br/>\nthe<br/>\n  girls have watched 4 hours of TV, it is his turn.  And that is how we view<br/>\n  it.  Whenever multiple people want to use the same thing but differently,<br/>\n  they have to take turns and share.  TV is the same way in our house.-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe you need more than one tv? That way everyone can be happy and not<br/>\n  *just* the person with the TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n  **** That is impossible in our current living situation.  Believe me, I<br/>\nhave wanted to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-Sometimes, though, I will shut it off and not let anyone watch for a<br/>\nlittle<br/>\n  bit because I grew up without a TV and having it on *all* the time drives<br/>\nme<br/>\n  batty.  I have to have some quiet in the house sometimes.  That is my turn<br/>\n  with the TV.  :)-=-=-=<br/>\n  Creepy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  **** Why is needing some quiet time &quot;creepy&quot;? See, what I have gotten from<br/>\nthese lists is that children have needs that must be met, but parents don&#39;t.<br/>\nWell, I do.  Most of the time, they get their TV on for every waking hour.<br/>\nOnce a month, if that, I say it stays off for an hour or two.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-When I don&#39;t take my turn, the rest of the family has it<br/>\n  on from 6 am to 10 or 11 pm.  Lauren will sometimes watch TV for a while,<br/>\n  then get up and shut it off and go do something else, usually playing with<br/>\n  her sister Rowan (12 mo).  The first time I saw that I was shocked.  I had<br/>\n  never seen a child voluntarily shut off the TV.-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe because your viewing was controlled as a child?<br/>\n  Our children seem to only watch when there&#39;s something interesting on.<br/>\n  They regularly turn it off to do other things. Amazing? No.<br/>\n  Expected when it&#39;s not limited.<br/>\n<br/>\n  **** I don&#39;t consider my TV viewing as having been controlled as a child.<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t have electricity to run a TV.  I did sometimes watch TV at my<br/>\nfriends&#39; houses.  It is no different than someone who grew up without pets<br/>\nbecause they had no ability to care for one (for whatever reason).  Was<br/>\ntheir pet situation &quot;controlled&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-I see my role of parent as being that of provider and protector.  I<br/>\nsee a<br/>\n  lot of emphasis on provider in all the info I have found on unschooling,<br/>\nbut<br/>\n  the protector part seems to be overlooked, at least in what I have<br/>\nfound.-=-=-=-<br/>\n  Right. We&#39;re all out to make sure harm comes to our children. The more<br/>\n  dangerous, the better.<br/>\n<br/>\n  **** I never said that.  You are now being passive aggressive.  What I<br/>\nhave seen indicates that the children are allowed to make *all* the<br/>\ndecisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-There is a reason why humans rear their children for roughly two<br/>\ndecades,<br/>\n  instead of leaving them to their own devices from day one like reptiles<br/>\ndo.-=-=-<br/>\n  And now we&#39;re leaving them to their own devices? And being compared to<br/>\ncrocodiles????<br/>\n  How long have you been reading here?<br/>\n<br/>\n  ****  I have been reading here and at UnschoolingDiscussion for nearly a<br/>\nmonth. I have also read some of Sandra Dodd&#39;s articles, but it will take me<br/>\na long time to read them all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-I need to protect my children from making foolish decisions that<br/>\nwill cause<br/>\n  themselves pain or harm, and so I step in and give them the benefit of my<br/>\n  experience and wisdom. -=-=-=-<br/>\n  See, I choose to help my children make wiser decisions (and allow them to<br/>\nmake<br/>\n  a few mistakes---which we call learning-takes) NOW rather than have all<br/>\ntheir<br/>\n  decisions made FOR them and then turn them loose at 18 with no real handle<br/>\non<br/>\n  how to weigh those decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ****I believe in learning from the mistakes of others so you don&#39;t have to<br/>\nrepeat them for yourself.  I do also let them make some mistakes as well, as<br/>\nexperience is a better teacher in some circumstances.  When I do make a<br/>\ndecision for them, I explain why so that they can learn without the pain of<br/>\nthe mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-Wow, that sounds really condescending, but I can&#39;t<br/>\n  think of a better way to phrase it right now.-=-=-=-<br/>\n  Yes, it does. To us AND to your children.<br/>\n  -=-=-=-At such a young age, my<br/>\n  children don&#39;t have the experience or knowledge to make decisions about<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n  kinds of food to eat.  The relationship between diet and health is too<br/>\n  abstract for them right now.  It is easier to relate too much sugar to an<br/>\n  upset tummy than it is to relate the fact that you don&#39;t have the flu that<br/>\n  is going around to the fact that you take cod liver oil every day. -=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n  Huh?<br/>\n  See, I feel that the honest relationship between me and my children is<br/>\nMOST important.<br/>\n  I trust when they say they&#39;re hungry or when they&#39;re full.<br/>\n  And cod liver oil every day prevents the flu??? That&#39;s a fact? Call the<br/>\nAMA!<br/>\n<br/>\n  **** The flu shot certainly doesn&#39;t. You avoid the flu by maintaining a<br/>\nhealthy immune system.  CLO is one way to do that.  Obviously it is not the<br/>\nonly way, not can it do so all by itself.  But I am not here to discuss<br/>\nnutrition.  I used it as an example of a cause-effect relationship that is<br/>\ntoo obscure/subtle for small children to understand by themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-=- Lauren still doesn&#39;t really grasp the idea that she gets cranky<br/>\nby 5 or 6 pm<br/>\n  because she didn&#39;t take a nap.  Then she has temper tantrums and<br/>\nmisbehaves<br/>\n  and gets yelled at for it and everyone is miserable.  She doesn&#39;t like<br/>\n  getting yelled at, we don&#39;t like yelling, and it all could have been<br/>\n  prevented with a simple nap.-=-=-=-<br/>\n  She&#39;s TWO?  There&#39;s a whole lot more to it than that.<br/>\n  If allowed to learn when she needs sleep, she will nap when she is tired.<br/>\n  &quot;Then she has temper tantrums and misbehaves<br/>\n  and gets yelled at for it and everyone is miserable.&quot;<br/>\n  This one just makes me sad for that little girl. She gets yelled at for<br/>\nbeing tired???<br/>\n  She&#39;s blamed for making everyone miserable? She&#39;s TWO!<br/>\n<br/>\n  **** No.  Read what I said.  I said she misbehaves and gets yelled at for<br/>\nit.  She gets yelled at for hitting her sisters and screaming at us and<br/>\nthrowing things around the house, not for being tired.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-I hope this clarifies my position on &quot;structure&quot;.-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  No. It does clarify why you *think* you need to control your children.<br/>\n  But that has nothing to do with structure.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You might want to read more about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  **** I posted this so that you would understand what my thought processes<br/>\nare now and show me how and why I should change them.  I certainly did not<br/>\nexpect this kind of passive aggression.  I have read plenty of posts saying<br/>\nthat you should never say no to a child because it hinders their learning<br/>\nprocess.  I have not seen any posts about saying no to a child to protect<br/>\nthem from a danger they don&#39;t understand.  Try as I might I cannot see the<br/>\nlogic in that.  I wanted more people to explain it to me in the hopes that<br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s POV would help me understand.  I feel like I am being<br/>\nattacked for my ignorance and must defend myself.

It is easier to relate too much sugar to an<br/>\nupset tummy than it is to relate the fact that you don&#39;t have the flu that<br/>\nis going around to the fact that you take cod liver oil every day. -=-=-=<br/>\n <br/>\nHuh?<br/>\nSee, I feel that the honest relationship between me and my children is MOST important.<br/>\nI trust when they say they&#39;re hungry or when they&#39;re full. <br/>\nAnd cod liver oil every day prevents the flu??? That&#39;s a fact? Call the AMA!<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-=- Lauren still doesn&#39;t really grasp the idea that she gets cranky by 5 or 6 pm<br/>\nbecause she didn&#39;t take a nap.  Then she has temper tantrums and misbehaves<br/>\nand gets yelled at for it and everyone is miserable.  She doesn&#39;t like<br/>\ngetting yelled at, we don&#39;t like yelling, and it all could have been<br/>\nprevented with a simple nap.-=-=-=-<br/>\nShe&#39;s TWO?  There&#39;s a whole lot more to it than that.<br/>\nIf allowed to learn when she needs sleep, she will nap when she is tired.<br/>\n&quot;Then she has temper tantrums and misbehaves<br/>\nand gets yelled at for it and everyone is miserable.&quot;<br/>\nThis one just makes me sad for that little girl. She gets yelled at for being tired???<br/>\nShe&#39;s blamed for making everyone miserable? She&#39;s TWO!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-I hope this clarifies my position on &quot;structure&quot;.-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nNo. It does clarify why you *think* you need to control your children. <br/>\nBut that has nothing to do with structure.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou might want to read more about unschooling.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly, who is usually more forgiving and <br/>\npatient on this list. I just got pretty peeved.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35057,"nextTopicId":35058}}
