I started wearing them... every time.  I can&#39;t tell you how many<br/>\ntimes the seatbelt has kept me from injury... it&#39;s kept me from flying<br/>\nthrough my windshield in one really bad accident.  I figured, I&#39;ll take the<br/>\nsmall inconvenience of wearing the seat belt (I feel unsafe if I don&#39;t wear<br/>\none now) than to have my face and body smeared all over the pavement.... or<br/>\nmy body being mangled with the engine.  As much as death and gore intrigues<br/>\nme... I&#39;m not interested in it for myself before my time.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI also think the fact that I (we) have no health insurance keeps me more<br/>\naware of safety for myself and my family, too.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLesa\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n-------Original Message-------\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nFrom: crissyhall\r<br/>\nDate: 03/10/06 11:57:51\r<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] re:safety & seatbelts\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nWhen I was a teenager, I never wore my seatbelt.

I have mentioned once we were in a car accident when my oldest daughter was 3, the <br/>\nonly thing that saved her-- her car seat had just been installed properly by someone from <br/>\nthe state(two days before).  I am very nerotic about seat belts and car seats/booster seats.  <br/>\nIf we don&#39;t have the right equiptment to ride safe, we don&#39;t go.
