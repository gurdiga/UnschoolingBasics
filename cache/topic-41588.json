I can communicate with them in a manner that doesn&#39;t destroy their curiosity and creativity or squash their self-worth. I can work to reverse the damage done by other family that thinks control and authority is the way to parent by showing that I don&#39;t have to be that way. At least, I hope I can.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can.  Have you ever read &quot;Parenting from the Inside Out&quot;?  Great book to help parent yourself as well as your children in a healthy way.  It helped me so much!!!  Too many of our parents fell prey to society&#39;s pushing and shoving children into a mold.  I&#39;m so glad to see so many parents getting back to good parenting.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDiana<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41507,"nextTopicId":41587}}
