My<br/>\nhusband is mostly too busy to take us out. I got lots of colorful<br/>\npapers to make crafts with them. But what? my son isn&#39;t interested at<br/>\nthem at all. at first he claimed he wants to make a butterfly but he<br/>\nlost interest. He plays in the computer and watches movies of spiderman.<br/>\n<br/>\nI make breakfast he comes to eat it then runs back to the computer. <br/>\nI got a nice book so I read it. My son comes sits next to me asking me<br/>\nto read it to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the boy from the friends who are also homeschooled is coming to<br/>\nmy house. His younger brother who is my son&#39;s age is going to school.<br/>\n(he asked his mother to go to school)<br/>\nBoth of the boys run upstairs to the computer again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went downstairs to do housework. Then dinnertime came already. My<br/>\nson finished to eat then he walks around singing to himself. or he is<br/>\nriding the trycycle. <br/>\n<br/>\nsome days I take him out to the park with the younger siblings.<br/>\n(sister and brother)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, i can&#39;t help it but be self conscious when the people are asking<br/>\nme: what are you doing all day?!! It certainly look like I do<br/>\n&#39;nothing&#39; with my son.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it okay? (Here I go, deschooling myself too!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26092,"nextTopicId":26131}}
