The chore and television issues were tough for me. Given <br/>\nmy background-raised in a cultish Christian church in which <br/>\ntelevision was viewed as evil-it&#39;s amazing I ever got it!!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was 2002 when I made the shift on the chore/television stuff. In <br/>\n2001 I had lightened up a LOT about tv, but it really sunk in about <br/>\nthree years ago, thanks to Anne, Kelly, Joyce, Pam, Sandra, Rue, Deb <br/>\nand many other beautiful voices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have archived a few of my own posts about the chore issue, but <br/>\nunfortunately, the tv ones got deleted somehow. I can&#39;t find them at <br/>\nunschooling.com either. I DID post them before, I believe at AL or <br/>\nUD, but it would be a major pain to find them in the archives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t so negative about it, I simply agreed to disagree. I really <br/>\nthought I was right.....but also thought these ladies were onto <br/>\nsomething.<br/>\nTurns out they were.;)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6325,"nextTopicId":6206}}
