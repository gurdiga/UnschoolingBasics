I mean NONE.  It&#39;s just our kids.  <br/>\nWell, to start with we had no lemonade nor lemons.  So I told him <br/>\nthat we didn&#39;t have any lemonade fixings.  He decided instead he was <br/>\ngoing to have a water stand.  So he took an old box, wrote a sign <br/>\n(wotr stand $5), took my best pitcher, a bunch of paper cups and <br/>\nwent to go have a water stand.  He was out there about 20 minutes <br/>\nbefore he decided that he wasn&#39;t making any money and abandoned <br/>\nhis &quot;wotr stand.&quot;  It was cute and I wish I had remembered to go out <br/>\nand take pictures.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, for your son, what if you had him make a sign on the <br/>\ncomputer and print it off? Show him how to change fonts and sizes.  <br/>\nMaybe you could find a font that he could color in (by hand or by <br/>\ncomputer).  Help him make a list of the things that he needs for his <br/>\nlemonade stand.  And then let him have a lemonade stand.

They play and play at all sorts of stuff. Computer games, watching T.V, pretend games, on the trampoline, sword fighting e.t.c.  They learnt the alphabet off Nick Junior and can both read some but it is not a priority for them. I didn&#39;t teach them. They picked up words from me reading to them -and believe me we don&#39;t read much - and stuff they saw on T.V. They don&#39;t do it much cos they are not into it.  They do like me to read books on their current interest tho. ( about once a day for 10 minutes tops lol) At the moment it is castles and knights and they like me to read books about castles and knights and go computer website games about castles e.t.c.  One takes old stuff apart like a old printer and microscope that got broken and the other likes to make stuff with wood.  Sometimes if they need to demonstrate they can do somethg they will.  Like  just recently one went for an eye test.  He read the letters and numbers and multiplied numbers and I didn&#39;t even know he could.  I know all the playing is getting them where they want to be and increasing their understanding of things they need to understand for themselves and that is what counts.  It  is amazing how learning takes place bouncing or laying on a trampoline for hours.  I am glad they are not my first at unschooling otherwise I may have lost my bottle.<br/>\n<br/>\nRuth<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201016849,"authorName":"Angela","from":"&quot;Angela&quot; &lt;taomom@...&gt;","profile":"hippiemaof3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Thanks for your support ; )","postDate":"1112898546","msgId":5370,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQzM3U1aStsNHZmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTkwMWM1M2FmZSQ5ZGRmNzllMCQwNTI0OWYxOEBjaGFydGVydG4ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":5369,"nextInTopic":5371,"prevInTime":5369,"nextInTime":5371,"topicId":5360,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you all for your wonderful encouragement!
