They are  <br/>\nincapable of honoring differences. Even if your child is disabled,  <br/>\nand they are servicing them in a disability program, once those  <br/>\ndifferences make your child the wrong shape to fit in their cookie  <br/>\ncutter program, then they get difficult, everyone gets stressed. I  <br/>\nknow I said this before, I cannot emphasize enough, that kids who  <br/>\nappreciate scheduling will put themselves through hell to maintain  <br/>\nthat schedule. It&#39;s a far greater service to put some sort of  <br/>\nschedule up at home. It&#39;s not difficult and worth it to boost their  <br/>\nself-esteem.<br/>\n<br/>\nBreanna was all smiles through kindergarden. She had a few incidents,  <br/>\nbut nothing major. They &#39;taught&#39; her how to cut out shapes, how to  <br/>\ntrace letters, how to stand in line. all stuff that I&#39;m very aware  <br/>\nnow that she&#39;s older were things that she would have done when  <br/>\ndevelopmentally ready.  But it was very obvious that they were  <br/>\nteaching her nothing academic, and not so much as far as social  <br/>\nskills go. In fact, she learned how to hit and scream and cuss at  <br/>\nschool, in the first grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;ve learned is that the schools are great at hiding  <br/>\nproblems, and kids with disabilities often are not aware that what&#39;s  <br/>\ngoing on is wrong. So even unpleasant, harmful things like being  <br/>\ncalled names, being pulled around by the arm, being put in time out  <br/>\nare things that they accept willingly. And being nonverbal is worse,  <br/>\nbecause at least Josh, who has aspergers and never once realized that  <br/>\nit was wrong to be treated that way, could tell me what happened and  <br/>\n*I* could say something. But with Bre it was a matter of catching  <br/>\nthem. I was up there all the time. An hour after I dropped her off,  <br/>\nan  hour at lunch, an hour before school let out.

She was having problems with the two youngest (DH has 3 <br/>\nsisters, one is 2 yrs younger and the other two are 15 and 17 yrs <br/>\nyounger respectively). They were diagnosed with anxiety disorders and <br/>\ndepression right around age 14ish (one right after the other). They <br/>\ncould NOT go to school - between the anxiety and the medication which <br/>\noften had them awake all night and asleep all day and all like that. <br/>\nMIL requested the school send a homebound tutor (DH had had a tutor <br/>\nfor a bit around age 11 when he was literally bedridden after hip <br/>\nsurgery). The school district wouldn&#39;t help an inch. MIL was about in <br/>\ntears about what to do, truant officers, DCF, etc. We found that CT <br/>\n(where they live, we were in OK at the time) has really great <br/>\nhomeschooling laws, or rather lack thereof. MIL and FIL both worked <br/>\nfulltime but the girls were old enough to be home by themselves. In <br/>\nthe process, DH and I started discussing the idea of homeschooling. <br/>\nThen lo and behold I was pregnant! According to MIL I called and <br/>\nsaid &quot;You&#39;re going to be a grandma and we&#39;re homeschooling&quot; Now, MIL <br/>\nhad texts and left assignments for the girls to do and all like that <br/>\n(relaxedly schoolish). DH and I fell onto the topic &quot;unschooling&quot; and <br/>\nI read a bunch at various places and we started on the path - it made <br/>\nperfect sense to DH, I still kind of looked at scope & sequence stuff <br/>\na bit until DS was maybe 4 or 5 - then it was so apparent that <br/>\nlearning was happening in all sorts of ways, I just stopped bothering <br/>\nabout it. Over time, things have changed and grown or refined - for <br/>\ninstance, we did smack his butt on occasion when he was really young <br/>\n(that ended by the time he was about 3) and he did have a bedtime <br/>\n(which ended when he was about 5). Food and electronics (TV, video, <br/>\ncomputer, videogames) were never big issues - though we did avoid <br/>\nvideogame systems for a bit because of DH&#39;s history with them. But <br/>\nwhen DS was about 5, we got him a gameboy and that has progressed to a <br/>\nPlayStation 2 and his own laptop at this point (he&#39;s 8 now).<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] The &quot;whys&quot;","postDate":"1155234170","msgId":16447,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE4NTlGODY4LTg0RTMtNEVBRi1BRUZFLTVFNjQwNjY2MDhGRUBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGViZnB1cSsyYzcyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGViZnB1cSsyYzcyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16446,"nextInTopic":16448,"prevInTime":16446,"nextInTime":16448,"topicId":16444,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We fell into unschooling.

Them being human beings, not less than as some parents see <br/>\ntheir children, with thoughts, feeling, ideas, wants and needs all <br/>\ntheir own.  We have always believed that the individual is fully <br/>\ncapable of knowing what is best for himself.  Having this foundation of <br/>\nworking together, talking, seeking, and exploring, has led us to <br/>\nexplore unschooling as one facet of our lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur children became &quot;school age&quot; we all knew that school would not work <br/>\nfor any of us.  They were not ready to be apart from the loving, <br/>\nnurturing environment they had, why would they.  We were not at all <br/>\ncomfortable with the idea of sending a 4 or 5 year old off on their own <br/>\nall day to &quot;fight&quot; their way through.  So we began exploring all <br/>\nalternatives.  Homeschooling was the way, and unschooling just fit in <br/>\nwith our philosophy of self determination.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow we have days filled with joy, and wonder as I get to see the world <br/>\na new, with my children exploring and learning all the time.

We started off with our<br/>\noldest in Kindergarden although we knew eventually we would be<br/>\nhomeschooling because we knew how &quot;smart&quot; our child was and that<br/>\neventually traditional schooling would be of little use for her.  She<br/>\nhad the &quot;dream teachers&quot; for K through 2nd (and I truly do believe<br/>\nthat they were wonderful teachers.  Had my children been fortunate<br/>\nenough to have teachers like this all along we probably would never<br/>\nhad homeschooled!)  Her third grade teacher was a disaster!  We made<br/>\nit a whole 3 weeks before we leapt into homeschooling.  I really felt<br/>\nthat my daughter needed to heal from those horrible three weeks and<br/>\nthen realized that I couldn&#39;t really do much that looked like real<br/>\nschool.  3or so years ago they dabbled back in school for a year when<br/>\ntheir father and I separated and divorced, but came home that summer<br/>\n(actually Emily quit school mid-year because of another disasterous<br/>\nteacher) when my ex and I bought a house together.  From the point<br/>\nwhen Emily quit school we started unschooling.  First it was just<br/>\ncuirriculum and it eventually flowed into the rest of our lives as I<br/>\nallowed myself to trust my children.  I had heard of unschooling here<br/>\nand there, but hadn&#39;t done much reading of it until we really started<br/>\ndoing it.  Ren is the one that pointed me towards Holt, Dodd, Kohn,<br/>\netc and this list.  It was her personal touch that really helped<br/>\nthough.  Being able to go to her house and see her in action with her<br/>\nkids.  See it all working.  That was such a blessing!  I think that is<br/>\none of the big reasons that I miss her (oh and that she always had a<br/>\npot of tea going LOL!)  Tea with Ren.  I should write a book :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that reading books from experienced unschoolers (including my<br/>\nfriend Terry who is quoted throughout the Unschooling Handbook - and<br/>\nwho I know through LLL) and blogs and posts and articles has really<br/>\nhelped affirm more than convince me of where we are heading.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle - who is enjoying a peaceful day with her co-parent working<br/>\nfrom home, 2 children laughing at a video game in the living room and<br/>\nanother curled up with a cat asleep on my bed.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231753155,"authorName":"sara_boheme","from":"&quot;sara_boheme&quot; &lt;Superchick400@...&gt;","profile":"sara_boheme","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"The &quot;whys&quot;","postDate":"1155230490","msgId":16444,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGViZnB1cSsyYzcyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16445,"prevInTime":16443,"nextInTime":16445,"topicId":16444,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Greetings all!
