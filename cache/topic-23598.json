I<br/>\nstruggled for so long with this issue, wanting to be the perfect<br/>\nunschoolings mother and feeling deep down, my mother instinct, that my son<br/>\nNEEDS me to guide him strongly, although he never asked me directly in words<br/>\nto do so. And that is how I am raised; Speak, Talk and Reflect. But my son<br/>\ndoes not want to speak so much. He shows me his needs in his actions and is<br/>\nnot aware of the connection between what he needs (from me) and words. So if<br/>\nI ask: &quot;Shall we play with the ball?&quot; he will say: &quot;No.&quot; If I start to play<br/>\nwith the ball, he can feel in his body if he wants to join me and most of<br/>\nthe time he starts playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is getting crazy in front of the tv, and I ask questions, does not<br/>\nmatter which questions, he refuses to answer them. NOT because we have a bad<br/>\nrelationship, or that he does not trust me. But because he does not like to<br/>\ntalk. Talking is too much of a cortex action and my son is intuitive, full<br/>\nof feelings and he learns through experience rather than reading or<br/>\nlistening or whatever. So he soaks the images on the tv and get completely<br/>\nabsorbed by it, not able to quit, to stop, to walk away. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I wanted to be the perfect unschoolingsmother by the book and I fought<br/>\nmy instincts for months. So I bit my nails and swallowed my words, stopped<br/>\nmy impulses. And than one day I could not do it anymore. I stopped him. I<br/>\njust went to the tv and turned it off. He looked at me and asked me what I<br/>\nwas doing. And I told him shortly that it was over with the tv. That I would<br/>\nset limits and which ones. It all came from deep down my body. I was<br/>\ncompletely authentic, I took him by his hand and gave him what he needed: my<br/>\nstrong safe guidance. He went to a friend of his. And the days after that he<br/>\nsometimes asked if he could watch tv. I just looked at him and than he<br/>\nrelaxed. After awhile he came to me and said he was happy that I stopped<br/>\nhim. He does not speak about the tv again. He is playing and more centered<br/>\nthan ever. Sometimes he wants to watch a dvd and enjoys it. The next day he<br/>\nwants to see it again and than he forgets about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had the same with food. We let him free. And his body was hurt, he has a<br/>\ngreat lack of vitamines which we are rebuilding for weeks now and he had<br/>\nsevere, how do you call it in english. diarrhee?? He was in bad shape. Pale<br/>\nskin, he drank at least 3 liters a day, did not eat much and if he ate he<br/>\ntook candy, sweet things with sugar and so on. I stopped him. I guided him<br/>\nback into his body by telling him what he could eat and what not. Within two<br/>\nweeks he had a connection with his body again and now his food is in his<br/>\nhands again. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he is happy now, felling much more healthy than before and he is<br/>\ngrateful that we helped him to find his way back to his balance. He was not<br/>\nable to do so on his own. And nothing we tried worked. Exept taking the<br/>\nresponsibility as a parent to see that our son was needing our guidance. We,<br/>\nas parents, first had to learn to become authentic. We first had to learn<br/>\nthe difference between authoritarian and authentic.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy english is not my native language but I hope I made myself a little<br/>\nclear.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nEugenie<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nMijn Postvak In wordt beschermd door SPAMfighter<br/>\n3903 spam-mails zijn er tot op heden geblokkeerd.<br/>\nDownload de gratis SPAMfighter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spamfighter.com/lnl\">http://www.spamfighter.com/lnl</a>&gt;  vandaag<br/>\nnog! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162389347,"authorName":"Deb Rogers","from":"Deb Rogers &lt;nwdeb@...&gt;","profile":"nwdeb","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:question about kids watching the news","postDate":"1179327079","msgId":23698,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNjY2OC40MjQ0MS5xbUB3ZWI2MTAyNS5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":23685,"nextInTopic":23733,"prevInTime":23697,"nextInTime":23699,"topicId":23598,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ren, Thank you for this very thoughtful and thorough response.

If I did exit the<br/>\nroom because I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t keep watching I had already passed the point<br/>\nof what I was<br/>\nable to process. I may have looked fine on the outside<br/>\nwatching the<br/>\nmovie but inside my heart was beating fast, my pulse<br/>\nracing. My<br/>\nmother was none the wiser to the toll it was taking on<br/>\nme. It took a<br/>\nvery long time before I opened up to my mom about my<br/>\nfears. This is<br/>\none example of many I could give. I guess I just don&#39;t<br/>\nagree with the<br/>\nline of thinking that what our children watch on TV<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have an<br/>\naffect on them. I really do believe in self-regulation<br/>\nfor children,<br/>\nbut with TV I&#39;m not so sure. I think it&#39;s influence is<br/>\nmuch more<br/>\npowerful than we give it credit for. I do think<br/>\nchildren take in what<br/>\nthey watch and absorb it. They may not understand as<br/>\nwe adults do and<br/>\nhow they process it may be even worse than we think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should clarify that I am not against television for<br/>\nreligious<br/>\nreasons, as I get asked that a lot. It purely from my<br/>\nexperience with<br/>\nit. I feel like I was absorbing way more than I was<br/>\nready for at a<br/>\nyoung age. I do not see any benefit to television. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have a<br/>\ntelevision in my home. It certainly wouldn&#39;t be fair<br/>\nto tell my<br/>\nchildren they couldn&#39;t watch tv while I did, so I&#39;ve<br/>\ngotten rid of it<br/>\naltogether. Therefore (at least for the time being)<br/>\neliminating the<br/>\nhassle it seems to cause. I don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>\nwhat they<br/>\nwatch, because it&#39;s not simply not an option without a<br/>\nTV in the<br/>\nhouse. I want my children (at least in their younger<br/>\nyears) to grow<br/>\nup with a reverence for the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that unschooling is about giving our<br/>\nchildren access to<br/>\nwhat they love. I really do. I understand it is about<br/>\nconnection &<br/>\nsharing. I understand that forbidding something makes<br/>\nit even worse.<br/>\nHowever, do we really think that a murder scene on TV<br/>\nis what our<br/>\nyoung children want to see, or is it simply wanting to<br/>\nbe close to a<br/>\nparent who is watching such a show that they really<br/>\nwant? Is wanting<br/>\nto be part of the conversation between mom & dad what<br/>\nthey want, as<br/>\nopposed to watching the news itself? Am I alone here?<br/>\nIs their anyone<br/>\nout there that has similar feelings? I&#39;m sure I&#39;m<br/>\ngoing to get flack<br/>\nfor this post. Really, I&#39;m giving my thoughts most<br/>\nsincerely. I&#39;m<br/>\ncurious to know if others feel this way, and if not<br/>\nwhat is the<br/>\nreasoning?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKendrah<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What we do for ourselves dies with us.

I have 3 older kids ages 12, 14 and almost 17 so the little one has been exposed to more mature subject matter most of his life... he LOVES Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Star Wars and the like whereas my older kids would have been terrified of the same movies at the same age (different temperaments and because they were all little and I was controlling the tv they only watch &quot;age appropriate&quot; shows... BLECH!)    Anyway my fear (and I know this is MY issue not his) is that he will see something that will really scare him or make him feel<br/>\n unsafe in the world.... I am trying hard to trust him that he will turn it off if he finds it scary like he will with other shows and I do know that I am usually nearby and can explain things or comfort him etc if he needs it.    Is my former coercive parent showing??   Dh and I have always watched the news in our bedroom because our 12 yr old is very sensitive (has various special needs) and gets very upset if she sees scary things on tv...she refuses to discuss it so it&#39;s just been better to keep things out of her view.  Now my 5 yr old has the daily news on our living room wide screen in high definition!   Do I just trust him on this , do I try to convince him to only watch if I can be right there to help,    is this just a phase that I need to not panic about??     I will say that my 5 yr old is a very compassionate &quot;fixer&quot; ....our 12 yr old recently has a serious surgery and he&#39;s been working out a plan ever since to explain to the surgeon how he could have done the<br/>\n surgery without such a big incision and causing less pain to his sister.  (this is the sister that he is constantly at war with to boot so he is showing the ability to be VERY forgiving!)  <br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nLisa Blocker (unschooly mom to 4 kiddos, 3 cats and 1 leopard gecko)  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________Sick sense of humor?
