While it may not be the ideal<br/>\nsituation for schooling, at a time like that, I think having the<br/>\nfamily connection would be more important. Of course, I would also<br/>\nhope that the grandparents would abide by our and my children&#39;s wishes<br/>\nto the extent they could. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the legal aspect, we finally did ours in a rush (we went away<br/>\nfor the first time since becoming parents 6yrs ago). I typed a legal<br/>\nsounding document - got ideas from the internet - and we had it<br/>\nnotorized. I&#39;m sure it probably isn&#39;t the best way to do it but in our<br/>\nsituation it will be fine. There will be no-one contesting our wishes. <br/>\n<br/>\nalison</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4560266,"authorName":"singdoula@aol.com","from":"singdoula@...","profile":"singdoula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] OT-Appointing Guardians","postDate":"1166424708","msgId":19873,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMxYi5hOGFjODQ0LjMyYjc5NDg0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":19871,"nextInTopic":19884,"prevInTime":19872,"nextInTime":19874,"topicId":19863,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/18/2006 1:43:36 A.M.

She was killed in a car  accident <br/>\non the way home. She and her husband were in separate cars  so he <br/>\nsurvived. Just that quick her life was done. It&#39;s really made  me start <br/>\nthinking about appointing guardians. Certainly a downer of  a topic, but <br/>\na necessary one none the less. Have some of you done  this? Did you <br/>\nappoint family? I know blood is thicker than water (or  so the saying <br/>\ngoes) but none of our family sees life the same way we  do. We have <br/>\nstrong feelings on attachment parenting, veganism,  unschooling, etc. <br/>\nNobody in either of our families comes close to  even sharing any of <br/>\nthese. So how did you guys who have chosen a  guardian decide on them? <br/>\nAnd how did you go about putting your  wishes in writing? I have heard <br/>\nthat something as serious as this  should be done by a lawyer otherwise <br/>\nit can be contested quite  easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nKendrah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOH BOY OH BOY, Can I truly relate to your fear!!!!! I  don&#39;t have one single <br/>\nperson in my life (that I&#39;m related to) who  would raise my children if <br/>\nsomething happened to me in a way that they  wish to be raised (as unschoolers) My <br/>\nsister is a  super mother and has homeschooled her children until recently  but <br/>\nshe is VERY structured about it, they have tests, spelling  assignments, do <br/>\nstandardized evaluations every year, etc... My kids would  HATE THAT. My mom <br/>\nwho is 71 would do a great job but can you ask someone  of that age to raise <br/>\nyour children? My boyfriend would also do great but  how would he support them on <br/>\nhis own like that? I have a DEAR friend who  unschools too but she suffers <br/>\nfrom health problems that would make it  impossible for her to raise her 3 kids <br/>\nplus my 3. Biological dad isn&#39;t an  option at all. Its really a MESS. As a <br/>\nresult I am SOOOO careful about  everything I do. I used to enjoy riding and <br/>\njumping horses but now  find myself not even doing that in fear that the kids <br/>\ncould God  forbid loose me and then not be raised the same way. It is hard enough <br/>\nas  it is when you are &quot;normal&quot; but when you have an alternative lifestyle  <br/>\n(like ours) it makes things seem impossible. Sorry I don&#39;t have help for  you - <br/>\njust sympathy. Also, I am sorry about your friend. That is awful!  Right now I <br/>\nhave a girl in my children&#39;s choir who lost her mom 3  years ago, and she is <br/>\na MESS. Parents were divorced before it happened,  mom was an awesome lady, <br/>\ndad was always cheating and whoring around. For  some reason dad ended up with <br/>\nthe daughter and has a different lady at  home every 3 weeks. The little girl <br/>\nis tortured. I would not be surprised  if she either ends up on drugs or worse. <br/>\nShe is the most emotionally  disturbed little girl I have ever met and the <br/>\nsadness is so deep and dark  within her eyes that you feel like crying just <br/>\nlooking at her.

( He did two years of College but says he learned nothing and wanted to be home with his cows farming)<br/>\nShe would be a big NO. My SIL , I love her but NO WAY as a parent. Punishments, punishments, etc You get the picture. I know how she was raised and how she raises her kids.<br/>\nMy sister I love her and bless her heart she tries. When I talk to her about parenting issues she seems to understand and agree but she cannot get it and use it. It took me years talking to her about not spanking and her agreeing now she finally stopped but still there is no way and her DH is a good guy but very mainstream.<br/>\nI got a cousin that I love in NC that I think she may do good with help from the unschooling community. She has two kids that are living outside her house and a teenager still living with her.<br/>\nI wish there were more unschooling families around here that I could meet ...<br/>\nI would rather my kids went to school if the people were gentle parents than stay being homeschooled by authoritarians.<br/>\nAlex<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, December 18, 2006 1:07 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] OT-Appointing Guardians<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:carebear-79@...\">carebear-79@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Certainly a downer of a topic, but<br/>\n  a necessary one none the less. Have some of you done this? Did you<br/>\n  appoint family?<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Absolutely not.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We redid our wills the day after Cameron&#39;s 18th birthday last year. He <br/>\n  is now listed as Duncan&#39;s guardian.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But before that, we&#39;d chosen two childless friends. Patrick is a <br/>\n  sociology prof at the unversity. his wife, Gillian, is the head of a <br/>\n  private school. Back then, if we were both to die, Pat & Gill would get <br/>\n  both boys. One of them would quit teaching to be 100% with the boys. <br/>\n  They are still listed in our wills as guardians for Duncan if something <br/>\n  were to also happen to Cameron. They are also listed as <br/>\n  &quot;helpers/guide/resources&quot; for Cameron if he needed them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  No family members would do. Too strict and schooly---just wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n  happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know blood is thicker than water (or so the saying goes)<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe---but not around here. We have a very tightly-knit group of <br/>\n  freinds who are closer to us than any of our family members (except <br/>\n  maybe my dad---but he&#39;s to the *right* of Hitler in some ways! &lt;G&gt; We <br/>\n  don&#39;t want the boys with him all the time either!). We figure we&#39;ve <br/>\n  &quot;made&quot; a family of friends. Very close friends who are in so many ways <br/>\n  closer than family.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I don&#39;t buy that &quot;blood&quot; thingy! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\n  So how did you guys who have chosen a guardian decide on them?<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  We put SOOOO much thought into it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, we probbaly have enough unschooling friends we could ask. But at <br/>\n  the time, we had to think of people we KNEW. The unschoolers we knew <br/>\n  *OF* were scattered here and yon---and we didn;t *know* them IRL. Now, <br/>\n  I&#39;d have a dozen families that I would consider a good match for the <br/>\n  boys.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  And how did you go about putting your wishes in writing?<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lawyer. Wills.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And we were VERY explicit about our wishes---not just that they&#39;d go to <br/>\n  Patrick and Gillian, but that they would NOT go to any family members.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We also talked with the boys about it. They&#39;d rather stay in this house <br/>\n  with friends they know looking in on them. That&#39;s the deal now.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have heard that something as serious as this should be done by a <br/>\n  lawyer otherwise<br/>\n  it can be contested quite easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  That was my concern. Ben&#39;s family and my parents would desperately want <br/>\n  the boys. NOT a good match. Everyone knows our wishes. We&#39;ve spelled it <br/>\n  out for all of them. The boys stay here.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I seriously suggest getting to know other unschooling families (very, <br/>\n  very well) and work out things just in case.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I made the offer several years ago that I would be happy to take in <br/>\n  anyone&#39;s unschooling child(ren). One family took me up on it, and we <br/>\n  made it official in Albuquerque this past September. She is now <br/>\n  officially our godchild.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The chances are SOOO slim that we would ever have to take her in, but <br/>\n  the peace of mind that comes with such a commitment is amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n  __________________________________________________________<br/>\n  Check out the new AOL.
