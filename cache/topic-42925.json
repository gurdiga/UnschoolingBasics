It didn&#39;t stop her from learning to read, though. She still had lots of opportunities to interact with print - books with lots of labled pictures, subtitles on moves and games, a handful of cds with read-along books... and as I said, she&#39;d ask me to read things for her when she found it necessary - it just hasn&#39;t been something she wanted to do recreationally. Its good to Know that you don&#39;t Have to read stories to children for them to learn to read, if they aren&#39;t into that. So many of us have been told that reading to kids is the most important thing you can do to &quot;promote reading&quot; after all! Know that if your kids don&#39;t want that, its not going to hurt them to stop. If anything, it will help them feel better about reading as something they choose to do when and how they are ready. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] new to group and some basic questions","postDate":"1264112498","msgId":42936,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMwODM1My44Njg2OC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhqOW5uaCtpb2tpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhqOW5uaCtpb2tpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42934,"nextInTopic":42937,"prevInTime":42935,"nextInTime":42937,"topicId":42925,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Emma I would really recomend you reading more here: http://sandradodd.com/unschooling and here http://joyfullyrejoycing.com This is about reading: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-410270779\">Emma I would really recomend you reading more here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand here<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is about reading:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/reading\">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand deschooling:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/deschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nÂ <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] new to group and some basic questions","postDate":"1264110458","msgId":42934,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU4NTc4M0Q2LTAyOUEtNDI2OS04MEFELTEyMEU2NTQwRUU2Q0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhqOW5uaCtpb2tpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhqOW5uaCtpb2tpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42930,"nextInTopic":42936,"prevInTime":42933,"nextInTime":42935,"topicId":42925,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
