Does anyone have any ideas on what I should do<br/>\nabout my pixie baby wanting different color hair? Is their any safe<br/>\nhair die for her age, something that does not cost too much but that<br/>\nwe can change every so often?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell...first of all, you are not a horrible mother. A horrible <br/>\nmother would feel justified and not guilty. You were a concerned <br/>\nmother that had a bad moment. You realized it, and you tried to make <br/>\nit better...next time you&#39;ll catch yourself sooner, the time after <br/>\nthat before the words even leave your mouth. Live and learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the roomate...WHY? Don&#39;t choose to continually bring a <br/>\nnegative force into your life. You negotiated a situation with her <br/>\nthat is not working for your family. RE-negotiate.<br/>\nIf you continue to surround yourself with negative people, you will <br/>\ncontinue to pay the price. It isn&#39;t good for you, it isn&#39;t good for <br/>\nyour child and it isn&#39;t helpful for unschooling.<br/>\nThis person may seem to not have other options...I think you talked <br/>\nabout this before. But guilt is not a good basis for action. You <br/>\nneed to surround your life with positive energy and people.
