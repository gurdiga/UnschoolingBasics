The boys don&#39;t do any of this.  They are just rough.  (Patting on the head, grabbing legs, holding tight, straightening ears)  They are getting better all the time about grabbing the animals necks.  I was hoping someone had a great suggestions, but it is clear there is no easy answer.  I continually talk to the boys about proper behavior and we are starting to lock the animals in our room when it gets to rough in the rest of the house.  I think we will also build the kittens a higher climbing post to get away from the kids easier.  I think it is just an issue where some kids are gentler than others.  I am trying to help the kids find ways to love on the animals properly.  They really do love them!<br/>\n   Thanks for some good suggestions,<br/>\n   Amanda<br/>\n <br/>\n   <br/>\n                                                 Recent Activity<br/>\n                          <br/>\n           25<br/>\n       New Members<br/>\n                                                   <br/>\n           1<br/>\n       New Links<br/>\n                                           <br/>\n                      Visit Your Group           <br/>\n                  SPONSORED LINKS<br/>\n                                     <br/>\n   Home schooling curriculum                     <br/>\n   Parenting issue                     <br/>\n   Home schooling material                     <br/>\n   Home schooling resource                     <br/>\n   Home schooling high school                   <br/>\n       <br/>\n                                                                 Y!

We have always had kittens, puppies, foals, kids (baby goats) and such.  No form of meanness was every allowed, but then our kids just never were abusive.  We taught them from the beginning how to treat the babies and they just did.  If I ever found one of our pets being abused, I would have found the pet a new and better home AND corrected my child.  At one point, we had over 150 &#39;pets&#39; (counting all the chickens and turkeys, all hand held and friendly).  Granted we live on a farm but abuse is abuse.

This is our 3rd round of kittens. Which is<br/>\nkinda why the things my son was doing, I found a<br/>\nlittle scary. He would go up and kick them. <br/>\nAnyways, I&#39;ve done what has been said. When the<br/>\nkittens cry, I pretty much put them in a kennel or<br/>\nanother room. That seems to work the best. Talking<br/>\nonly helps so much. Your boys aren&#39;t kicking, which is<br/>\ngreat. Quick thought- maybe a stuffed kitten that they<br/>\ncan dance or play with? That worked with Parker. When<br/>\nhe goes to give one of the kittens dance lessons, I<br/>\nfind his toy. That seems to help. <br/>\nKittens can enjoy kennels just like dogs. We had a cat<br/>\nthat loved his. Even when the door was open, he&#39;d go<br/>\nin there. He kept his &#39;kills&#39; in there. Another one,<br/>\nwould bring her &#39;loveies&#39; in there so no one else<br/>\ncould play with them. Our dogs, prefer their kennels<br/>\nto just being out. I think because they get stepped on<br/>\nor fallen over, so it&#39;s just safer to lay in their<br/>\nkennels when not outside. I feel even pets have a<br/>\nright to a safe place all their own. <br/>\nI hope this helps. <br/>\nDanie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

I thought I&#39;d share what I learned about my son. <br/>\nI knew he was upset that we had to get rid of his cat.<br/>\nI thought that was the main reason for attacking the<br/>\nnew kittens. To me that sounded about right. I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have been more wrong. I feel so bad for not<br/>\nseeing it sooner. But my son was/is distraut (I think<br/>\nthat&#39;s the right word) over moving. <br/>\nWe&#39;ve looked at some bad offers, and some nice places<br/>\ndidn&#39;t work out. We are hoping the place we look at on<br/>\nTuesday works out, because this is so very upseting<br/>\nfor him and us. I wish things were going more<br/>\nsmoothly, for all of us. <br/>\nRen, I wasn&#39;t ignoring him. I don&#39;t think he could<br/>\ntell me. Sometimes I wonder if he&#39;s autistic. I know<br/>\nit&#39;s just who he is. He has a hard time getting us to<br/>\nunderstand him. I&#39;m so thankful for his tantrum,<br/>\nbecause that&#39;s when he finally let out that he just<br/>\nwants to move and that he hates this house. <br/>\nI feel like a really stupid mom, for not seeing it.<br/>\nBack to playing legos, take care everyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nDanie<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

I was in <br/>\nand out and didn&#39;t detect any issues or problems. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater that night, Jacqueline (the newly turned 8 year old) was <br/>\ntelling me what happened. She said that the boy was trying to hit <br/>\nShawna (my 11 year old) with a stick and that Shawna told him to <br/>\nstop, which he did. Then, he was trying to hit my son (13 years old) <br/>\nwith a baseball. Again, they asked him to stop. Jacqueline told me <br/>\nthat Shawna asked him &quot;Why are you like that? Where do you think you <br/>\nlearned to be like that?&quot;. <br/>\nLOL A therapist in the making. <br/>\nJacqueline told me that she said to him &quot;We&#39;re not violent in this <br/>\nfamily-we&#39;re unschoolers! You need to stop!&quot;. <br/>\nThat&#39;s my baby...advocate for peaceful unschooling. :-) <br/>\nI asked them why they didn&#39;t tell me and the girls said that <br/>\nthey &quot;wanted to try and talk to him first, kid to kid, and see if <br/>\nthey could get through to him&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n:-) <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (8), Shawna (11) & Cimion (13)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17563,"nextTopicId":17507}}
