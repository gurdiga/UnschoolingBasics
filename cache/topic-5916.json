Hi Nancy! Nancy had this great story about bats living in her house and baby bat ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-402584887\">***I am in Prince George, not on the Island,***<br/>\n<br/>\nLook, Look it&#39;s Nancy!!   Hi Nancy!<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy had this great story about bats living in her house and baby bat<br/>\nlearning to fly and landing in startling and unusual places.   Nancy&#39;s a<br/>\nvery interesting person.  She has other great qualities besides bat<br/>\ncaretaker and she&#39;s the one inspired me to feed the crows nesting behind<br/>\nmy house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI leave little terra cotta saucers filled with dry cat food on the fence<br/>\nposts.  The crows have been bringing their fledglings down to eat and<br/>\nwe&#39;ve had a wonderful time watching the young birds discover the world.  <br/>\nThere are two babies and they play at the bird bath.  They hop across it<br/>\nlike a human child might hop across a mud puddle.  Hop, whoa! Balance,<br/>\nturn around, hop again.  Two of them hopping at the same time can have<br/>\ncomplications and they handle them much the same way human kids do.   One<br/>\nbird likes to pick leaves and other debris out of the bird bath and will<br/>\nsit on the edge and pick up junk with his beak and drop it over the side.<br/>\n The other bird likes to put stuff into the bird bath so will hop down<br/>\nonto the ground and find little sticks and whatever he can find and fly<br/>\nback up and plop it into the water.  <br/>\nHe&#39;ll do this over and over again.  Lately he&#39;s been flying to the fence<br/>\nand picking up three or four pieces of cat food and dropping the little<br/>\nbits into the birdbath. The other continually works to pick the stuff<br/>\nout.  They scuffle and squawk when they get irritated with each other.  <br/>\nWhen they&#39;re finished with their exuberant bathing there&#39;s almost no<br/>\nwater left in the birdbath.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA side effect of feeding crows is that Blue Jays have stayed around to<br/>\nshare the cat food and Steller&#39;s Jays come occasionally and we have<br/>\nregular Grackles and we get an occasional neighborhood skunk if I forget<br/>\nthe food out there at night.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan can tell the crows apart in the crow family, he can tell the<br/>\ndifference between the two babies and the difference between the second<br/>\nyear siblings and the adult birds.   I know the babies when I see them<br/>\nbut don&#39;t know who&#39;s who until they&#39;re conducting their water<br/>\nexperiments. <br/>\n<br/>\nHer bat story also inspired Dylan to make bat houses and he&#39;s made six or<br/>\nso, gave some away for Christmas last year.  We have happy bats.   In<br/>\ntheir own house, not ours.  ; )<br/>\n<br/>\nAll Nancy inspired.  &lt;g&gt;  Isn&#39;t she cool? <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5913,"nextTopicId":5925}}
