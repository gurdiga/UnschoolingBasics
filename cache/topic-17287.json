Have them see, in their own lives, those  <br/>\ntimes when they learned something that wasn&#39;t in school, learned something like  <br/>\nbuilding a deck or planting a garden or about fishing, by maybe reading about  <br/>\nit, talking to people in the field, experimenting etc.  Then I can really  <br/>\ntalk to them about learning through life, following an interest or need that was  <br/>\ntheir own and not someone else&#39;s.  <br/>\n <br/>\nFinding that *something* really helps me show them about  unschooling, and <br/>\ntalk about unschooling.
