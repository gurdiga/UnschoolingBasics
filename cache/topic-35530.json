We met around Sept and the final event was in November, so we really had to meet about twice a week to get everything in order.  We started by modelling problem solving and teaching the kids who weren&#39;t familiar with it, so that they knew the process for resolving their group differences and decision making.  They did most of the work on the actual lego task.  They needed a bit of coaching on the oral presentation part.  It was a learning experience.  As unschoolers, we did the program with school-at-home people who were quite good in letting the children figure out most of it.  <br/>\nI should probably post an introduction, but this thread caught my eye.  :-)<br/>\nJudy Arnall,  Peaceful Parenting Expert, Speaker and Author of &quot;Discipline Without Distress: 135 tools for raising caring, responsible children without time-out, spanking, punishment or bribery&quot;  www.professionalparenting.ca   Tele: (403) 714-6766 Email <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jarnall@...\">jarnall@...</a>  &quot;Peace In The World Begins In The Home&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Beth Fleming <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, August 23, 2008 6:02 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] LEGO Robotics Team questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My kids both did Junior Lego League last year with our hs group (pretty lowkey and non-competitive) and my daughter did a robotics camp at a local engineering college this summer and had a blast.
