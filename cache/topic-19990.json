We had a solstice/yule celebration at Jenny&#39;s farm yesterday.  Lots of food --a delicious vegetarian stew -- and drink and kids playing inside and out.  We built a small cave, and at 5:22 pm (our local time solstice) we filled it with candles and a small mother-child figure (made of sparkly gold pipe cleaners for the baby sun).  Several of us sang a solstice song for/with the kids.  At one point in the evening, someone broke out the guitars and mandolins, along with some other instruments for some wonderful music.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  By late in the evening, we were down to three couples and 6 kids (4 of whom drifted off to sleep at some point).  When we left after 10 pm, there was still one candle burning in our cave.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Really a very nice welcome back for the sun.  And now the days are longer -- whether or not I can notice the difference, just knowing there was more sunlight today than yesterday is nice.  We&#39;ve spent most of the week at home -- baking, playing with new toys, and just being.  The last two months have been busy and transitional, so it&#39;s nice to just rest and have fun, while getting ready for Christmas.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Happy solstice -- and Christmas and New Year -- to everyone!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Mom to<br/>\n  Will (almost 22!)
