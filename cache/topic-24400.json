I also feel that <br/>\nthe other parents should be JUST as involved in watching out for YOUR <br/>\nchild. You would not let your child mistreat another child, and turn <br/>\na blind eye, and neither should they. If all else fails, and the <br/>\nlearning experience has passed with little results, I say take the <br/>\nchild out of the situation entirely. <br/>\n As for me, I addressed the problem repeatedly with my friend over a <br/>\n2 year period, pulling away and limiting playdates. When I finally <br/>\nsaw that she saw nothing wrong with her son&#39;s bully behaviors, <br/>\nactually citing Ryan&#39;s passivity as reason for her son&#39;s <br/>\naggressiveness, I broke ties with her (last Monday). Not an easy <br/>\nchoice for me, as it took me 2 years to reach this point., But I want <br/>\nto teach my children they deserve to be with people who treasure <br/>\nthem, and they should feel free to walk away from people who mistreat <br/>\nthem. I only wish I had to nerve to do it earlier (I am one to give <br/>\nbenefit of the doubt long after someone deserves it.)    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Julie&quot; &lt;wisdom1133@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Lisbeth&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;tomeghandmama@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i have a hard time w/ when other kids are downright cruel and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>seem <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; single out my dd megh who is 4.5yo.  this happened recently w/ 2 <br/>\n&gt; kids <br/>\n&gt; &gt; from 2 different families at one of my homeschool/unschool groups <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(i <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know how they think combining homeschoolers w/ unschoolers <br/>\n </span></blockquote>is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; somehow like-minded...it is but it isn&#39;t ya know...). i was <br/>\n </span></blockquote>apalled <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; at how my dd and her friend who is 5 were picked on...they were <br/>\n&gt; &gt; peacefully playing. some of my friends from that group tell me to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; have tolerance for the kids as they may have been having a bad <br/>\n </span></blockquote>day <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or <br/>\n&gt; &gt; a hard time at home or whatever but still...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I found myself thinking about your post off and on last night and <br/>\n&gt; could not put my finger on what was bothering me about it- then it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>hit <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; me as I lay in bed thinking.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You said that your kids were picked on by other kids and that this <br/>\n&gt; made you upset.

Kids do the best they can with what they have available <br/>\nin terms of skills, knowledge and support. We can&#39;t know what kinds <br/>\nof skills and knowledge other children have available to them, but <br/>\nwe have the potential to *be* part of that support. When we don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel up to being part of their support we can recongnize the ways in <br/>\nwhich they are not being supported. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; some of my friends from that group tell me to <br/>\n&gt; have tolerance for the kids as they may have been having a bad day <br/>\n </span></blockquote>or <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a hard time at home or whatever but still...it makes me not want <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; be around these families if this is how rude their kids are. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What does your dd want? Is she upset by the interactions and wants <br/>\nto avoid these kids? Morgan is sometimes upset in the moment but <br/>\ncools down quickly and wants to play more. Other times she seems to <br/>\nget along fine with other kids (and adults) but later will tell me <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t want to see person X for awhile. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; meghans&#39; friends some are just always so mean after a while to <br/>\n&gt; her...either totally shut off from her after a while, or are real <br/>\n&gt; rude and selfish w/ megh after a while<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, you used the expression &quot;after a while&quot; three times and I&#39;m <br/>\nseeing that as a big Aha! So things start off fine? Maybe the other <br/>\nkids are getting tired or in need of a snack or break. That&#39;s <br/>\nsomething you can help out with. You can schedule shorter visits. <br/>\nYou can suggest or offer snacks. You can do something with Megh to <br/>\ngive the other kids a break. You can spend more time with the <br/>\nkids &quot;after a while&quot; to help with the communication and problem <br/>\nsolving. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the 4 yo boy walked up and kicked their pile of sand over and <br/>\n&gt; then informed them that they cannot put sand on the sidewalk.....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m guessing you were too far away to say anything, but if these <br/>\nsorts of interactions are common in this group, that&#39;s a good <br/>\nindicator that you need to be spending more time closer to your dd <br/>\nso that you *can* help out. If you were right there, did you work <br/>\ntoward reassuring the little guy that it was okay and y&#39;all would <br/>\nclean up when you were done? Often that&#39;s all a young child needs in <br/>\nthat sort of situation - adult reassurance that &quot;its okay&quot; to break <br/>\nwhatever rule he&#39;s stressing over.

The hardest part for me is that conventional parenting <br/>\nassumptions creep into my own thinking - all those shouldn&#39;ts and <br/>\nmusts and don&#39;ts - not really for my *own* kids, but those others. <br/>\nIts much more helpful to look at other kids with compassion and try <br/>\nto figure out what I can do to help smooth things over. Its <br/>\nchallenging and I don&#39;t always &quot;get it right&quot; in the moment - but I <br/>\ndo try to look at the other povs afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5.5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":214857126,"authorName":"kristenhendricks55","from":"&quot;kristenhendricks55&quot; &lt;kristenhendricks55@...&gt;","profile":"kristenhendricks55","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: splashing a boy","postDate":"1181743012","msgId":24427,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY0b3QzNCsyaG4yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY0bjQ0MCtkN2VqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24417,"nextInTopic":24428,"prevInTime":24426,"nextInTime":24428,"topicId":24400,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"her best little girlfriend seems like a snobby little princess mainstream type. ish! ******** And she s, how old, four you said?
