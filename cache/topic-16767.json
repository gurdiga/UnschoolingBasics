If she is frustrated, you might want to research dysgraphia.  It is like dyslexia, but with writing.  It might be worth reading into a little.  There are some simple techniques that can help.  Many children will figure it out on their own, but some can benefit.  I know there is tracing and staying between the lines as part of the process.  Mazes and tracing books work well, it does not have to be letters.  If she is not interested now, you would have ideas for later if she becomes frustrated.  These are techniques she could practice as she gets interested and would not need any outside help.  My sister used to draw upside down and write is if in mirror.  Several years later, she has no problems.  It is usually overcome.  <br/>\n <br/>\n I would not place more importance on writing than anything else in her life.  Just treat it as you would anything else.  Let her enjoy the parts she likes, but be ready to help her if she gets frustrated.  Treat writing as any other interest.  I know I often learn about what my children are interested in at a deeper level than they are capable of.  That way I can answer their questions as they come up.  Ask me anything about Thomas or construction trucks.  Two topics I knew nothing of before life with boys.  I just tell them what they ask though.  They don&#39;t always want to know everything as once.  I keep information in reserve for later.<br/>\n <br/>\n Amanda<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nGet your own web address for just $1.99/1st yr.

(You can click  <br/>\non it to enlarge it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Q: What about children who do not write well, children who use  <br/>\ncapitals in the middle of a word?]<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s normal. It sounds like my 7 yo.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 7 yo daughter has rarely had a writing implement out of her hand  <br/>\nsince she picked one up at age two. We&#39;ve gone through at least two  <br/>\ncartons of blank paper for her drawings and writings. Her handwriting  <br/>\nis still lousy, but not for want of practice at small motor skills or  <br/>\nwhatever. She spent 2 months in school and it improved then but  <br/>\nslipped back after she left because right now it isn&#39;t an important  <br/>\npart of writing for her. When she writes, the point is to get the  <br/>\nthoughts in her head down on paper. (And don&#39;t get the idea she&#39;s  <br/>\nwriting Moby Dick ;-) They are very simple stories, notes, signs,  <br/>\nsometimes just a label on a picture.) When she is writing, forming  <br/>\nthe letters in a standard way just interfers with that process.  <br/>\nWriting &quot;properly&quot; is more like art and at the moment, she&#39;s more  <br/>\ninterested in other things. When she&#39;s interested in writing so  <br/>\nothers can read, or in more artistic handwriting, then she will do  <br/>\nso. *My* part in the process is to provide opportunities for her to  <br/>\ntake up when she&#39;s ready. I make sure she knows the books on Italic  <br/>\nhandwriting are there for her, pull out the calligraphy books every  <br/>\nonce in a while, pull out the Magnadoodle and form letters with her  <br/>\noccasionally (this is a *game*, I don&#39;t make her do it if she&#39;d  <br/>\nrather do something else). I did write out a bunch of fun personal  <br/>\nwords and names, one or more for each letter of the alphabet. Maybe I  <br/>\nshould have them laminated so she can play around with them and trace  <br/>\nover them. She&#39;ll write well when she&#39;s ready as long as she has  <br/>\naccess to materials to help her, a helpful mom and she knows the  <br/>\nprocess will be intriging and the skill useful or pleasing to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n2006 Update<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn, who&#39;s 14 now, and I were just discussing what I wrote about  <br/>\nhandwriting seven years ago. She says she remembers tracing numbers  <br/>\nand doing letters on the Magna Doodle but that she just went back to  <br/>\nforming the letters the way she was used to when we were done. She  <br/>\nsaid the tracing was fun but that as far as helping her to form her  <br/>\nletters in the more traditional way it had zero effect ;-) I&#39;d say  <br/>\nshe&#39;s spot on with her assessment! At seven she didn&#39;t have a need  <br/>\nfor traditional handwriting.

I think <br/>\nmyself and my husband are going through a bit of deschooling <br/>\nourselves!  Just to clarify, though, it&#39;s not merely sloppy <br/>\nhandwriting I&#39;m worried about.  It&#39;s backwards letters and spelling <br/>\nthat is often unreadable. I don&#39;t care if her handwriting is sloppy <br/>\nwhen she grows up, I just want her to learn to express herself <br/>\nthrough written language.  But, even so, I&#39;m going to back off and <br/>\njust let her find it at her own pace. I agree that I would much <br/>\nrather she enjoy the creative process than be technically <br/>\nproficient.  The reading and writing part is difficult for me to just <br/>\nlet happen, though, because I&#39;ve always been an avid reader and a <br/>\ngood speller.  But she&#39;s only seven, right?  And as it says in &quot;The <br/>\nProphet,&quot;  &quot;Your children are not your children. . . you can give <br/>\nthem your love but not your thoughts.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe pretty paper and nice pens are a great idea!  She sees both of us <br/>\nwriting both on paper and on computer, but the creative writing is <br/>\nalways done on the computer.  I&#39;m going to release this worry and let <br/>\nher come to it in her time.  My only fear with this course is what <br/>\nwill happen if we find out I have to teach in the daytime next year.  <br/>\nI&#39;m an adjunct professor of theatre, teaching night classes.  How <br/>\nwill she adjust if she has to go back to school?  Could I live with <br/>\nmyself if we had to send her back?  I hope to be able to keep her <br/>\nhome as long as possible and give her the time to learn at her own <br/>\nschedule, but will she adjust if it doesn&#39;t work that way?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh dear, I didn&#39;t mean to open up a new can of worms!  For now, I&#39;m <br/>\njust not going to worry and I&#39;m going to enjoy this new lifestyle.  <br/>\nSo far, it&#39;s changed so much about the way we live!  I feel so much <br/>\ncloser to my daughter and we&#39;re really enjoying integrating her and <br/>\nher interests into our lives.

He does  spend lots of his time <br/>\nthinking about and creating various inventions. His  room is filled with wires <br/>\nand robot parts and batteries and creations in various  stages of production.<br/>\n <br/>\nRecently, he found a composition book that has been lying around here for  <br/>\nyears and started writing up descriptions for all his ideas and inventions. He  <br/>\ncarries it around with him everywhere especially if we are going to be in the  <br/>\ncar awhile.  Pages and pages of his writings and drawings.  He&#39;s  shared some <br/>\nwith me and I found it amazing.  Great descriptions, very few  misspellings, <br/>\ngood punctuation.  Best of all, he&#39;s writing it all because  he wants to get <br/>\nthose ideas on paper.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHe did tell me today that one time when he was about 7 and we were still  <br/>\ndoing &quot;school at home&quot; that I was in a bad mood and made him write in his  <br/>\njournal and told him that he had to be finished in 15 minutes.&quot;   :-(      All these <br/>\nyears, he has carried that  around.  I told him I was so sorry.  We had a <br/>\ngreat conversation about  how much better our lives have been the past few years <br/>\nwith unschooling.

(I am<br/>\nalso new to this, but was told that after being in<br/>\npublic schools, the kids need time to relax, and have<br/>\nsome fun.).  Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, and enjoy.

We&#39;ve done a LOT of reading<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt;  unschooling, but we&#39;re still struggling with a few<br/>\n&gt; things. Mostly,<br/>\n&gt;  we&#39;re worried about her writing.

I&#39;ve tried<br/>\n&gt;  requiring that she write in her journal every day,<br/>\n&gt; but that is met<br/>\n&gt;  with groans and I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m turning her off of<br/>\n&gt; writing for good.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  -=-==-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  You&#39;re answering your own question!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  You could very well turn her off.

I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; spelling words all <br/>\n&gt; day. He&#39;s typing away.

Even more than you  <br/>\nI think.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my thought on your question is this: I think the key is to not  <br/>\nworry, even if she doesn&#39;t pick up the pen at all in her whole life  <br/>\nagain. What will really &quot;happen&quot;, if she has poor handwriting? Who  <br/>\nwill really see her handwriting? What do you need handwriting for  <br/>\nanyway? I don&#39;t need it, only for my signature sometimes ;-) And in  <br/>\n20 years people will need it even less. Computers are and will be  <br/>\neverywhere. 80% of my friends and family members own a laptop (which  <br/>\nis transportable like paper and pen). I write blindly and almost as  <br/>\nfast as I&#39;m thinking. When I try to write by hand, it&#39;s slow, my hand  <br/>\nhurts, I&#39;ve gotten too used to typing ;-) Sometimes I needed hand  <br/>\nwriting at university, but even there I started pulling out my laptop  <br/>\nand write directly, nicely and readable (later) into a word  <br/>\ndocument... And I remember soooo well, that when I was a child, I  <br/>\n*hated* it, that my thoughts were faster than I could write. I would  <br/>\nalways forget what I wanted to say (write) next by the end of the  <br/>\nsentence!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy bf types so much on the computer, that he struggles with his  <br/>\nsignature each time ;-) We even write the notes for shopping sometime  <br/>\nat the computer and print them out...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe essence of writing occurs in your head. The medium doesn&#39;t matter  <br/>\nso much. I have the feeling that she will stop being creative with  <br/>\nher own stories if she has to painfully write them down by hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my suggestions are:<br/>\n<br/>\ntyping software for learning fast typing, ten fingers, blindly (they  <br/>\nare usually fun)<br/>\nlet her type everything into the computer<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I can think of really is forms you have to fill out  <br/>\nfor applying to something... hm, is her handwriting enough for that?  <br/>\nMaybe let her write the shopping lists (if she chooses to do it at  <br/>\nthe computer she is very clever ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\noh, maybe try a calligraphy course or book or something.... like with  <br/>\nbrushes and china ink and so on. Maybe she likes that (does she like  <br/>\ndrawing and painting?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if I understood well the concept of unschooling, do it yourself.  <br/>\nSomewhere I read, some children never see their parents sleep  <br/>\n(because they go later to sleep and stand up earlier), so naturally  <br/>\ntheir children don&#39;t want to go to sleep. I think my daughter almost  <br/>\nnever sees me hand writing, only at the computer. Why should she  <br/>\nbother doing it herself, if she only sees people typing?<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\n-Germany</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New unschooling parents need advice about writing!","postDate":"1156543364","msgId":16768,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDODk2QTk1NDA0Rjc5Qy1BNTQtMzY0RkBtYmxrLWQxOC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGVjbm84dSttMmhnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVjbm84dSttMmhnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16767,"nextInTopic":16769,"prevInTime":16767,"nextInTime":16769,"topicId":16767,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
