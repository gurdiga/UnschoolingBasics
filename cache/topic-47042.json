That meant that his &quot;peers&quot; were the 17-18 yr old &quot;kids&quot; right out of high school who were also freshman. At the same time, we had already been married for two years or so, so his &quot;peers&quot; were young married couples (grad students and the like). And, too, a few of his professors were close to his age as well - closer, in fact, to his age than some of his classmates (classmates were about 10 yrs younger and some of the professors were less than 10 yrs older), so their age and related interests (in his major field) made them his &quot;peers&quot; as well. In fact, one of his friends celebrated his 21st birthday the exact same day as DH turned 30! Yet, their overlapping interests meant they were peers.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

That is one of the things I have to remind myself of. My daughter, age 12, has maybe 2 friends her age. However, she has lots of people she considers friends that are my age. She frequently talks to extended family and many of &quot;my&quot; friends on Facebook. There are, of course, times I go into panic mode thinking, &quot;she doesn&#39;t have any friends&quot; At those times, I try to step away from my own fears, and remember that her life isn&#39;t going to look the way mine did. I was surrounded by similar aged people so that&#39;s what I made friends with. Once out of school though, I have friends of all ages. So the fact that your son isn&#39;t in a school setting is probably very freeing to him, because he can befriend people with common interests, rather that just common age. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Marie&quot; &lt;mdvhome@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joyce,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s a good point about not finding someone for my 14 yo in the gathering.
