It involves<br/>\nfinding mutually agreed upon solutions, where the needs of both<br/>\nparties are not only considered but addressed. Everyone&#39;s wants and<br/>\nneeds are equally valid, regardless of age. Conflicting wants or needs<br/>\nare discussed and mutually agreeable solutions are created or<br/>\nnegotiated which meet the underlying needs of all parties. Beginners<br/>\nto this concept are welcome to join this list, living consensually is<br/>\nan ongoing process of discovery. We ask that you be open to or on the<br/>\npath toward living consensually. We hope to explore the issues by<br/>\nasking questions, and sharing our experiences. Parenting is a<br/>\nsensitive issue for many people but we are all here to practice this<br/>\nprocess, and can do so if the environment remains one of respect,<br/>\ncompassion, exploration and understanding.

Authoritarian parents are frequently not warm nor nurturing. <br/>\nThey<br/>\ndo not easily take their children&#39;s feelings into consideration and <br/>\ntend to<br/>\nbe more rigid, imposing rules without discussing the rationale with <br/>\ntheir<br/>\nchildren. They are quick to say, &quot;You do it because I told you to do <br/>\nit&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;You do it because I&#39;m your mother (or father).&quot; They resort to <br/>\nauthority<br/>\nand whether they realize it or not, they basically seek compliance and<br/>\nobedience. Authoritarian parents may certainly show love, but more often<br/>\nthan not it is conditional, predicated on a child behaving in ways that<br/>\nparents deem appropriate. Authoritarian parents are likely to resort to<br/>\ncorporal punishment rather than a problem-solving approach when they <br/>\nfeel<br/>\ntheir children are not complying with their demands and/or have <br/>\ntransgressed<br/>\nin some fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYuck, yuck, yuck!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n*Permissive:* These parents are most noted for their failure to <br/>\nestablish<br/>\nrealistic goals, expectations, and limits for their children. Baumrind<br/>\nidentified two kinds of permissive parents, the *permissive-indulgent* <br/>\nand<br/>\nthe *disengaged*. Permissive-indulgent parents may demonstrate love and<br/>\nwarmth, but they appear guided by the philosophy that &quot;children will <br/>\nlearn<br/>\non their own.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-==-=<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, children WILL learn on their own (we&#39;re hard-wired that way), but <br/>\nthey do so much better when they have a partner in the journey.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n They have difficulty setting rules and limits.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nHave they every heard of principles instead? We have no rules here <br/>\n(other than don&#39;t run around the pool!). Nor do we have arbitrary <br/>\nliimits.

I see it at lunch when I look across the restaurant at <br/>\nelderly parents out to lunch with their grown children. Everyone&#39;s <br/>\npissed off at each other. No balance. No respect.

Or must the parent let the child explore everything <br/>\nthe way<br/>\nthe child wants to?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain---only two options???<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our home, we buy the electric guitar and either keep it in the <br/>\ngarage music room OR get earphones so that the player can hear it but <br/>\nnot the rest of the house. OR talk about what&#39;s best for <br/>\n*everyone*---loud as it will go when the guitarist is home alone, but <br/>\nto be respectful of when others are around and need quiet.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m surprised to hear someone suggest that children don&#39;t choose <br/>\nto<br/>\neat trash.

He doesn&#39;t CHOOSE to eat trash---he&#39;s learning <br/>\nwhat is and isn&#39;t pleasant to eat. He&#39;s FEELING and exploring the <br/>\nitems, not necessarily eating them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re allowing him to get too near a corpse or trash, that&#39;s not <br/>\n*his* fault---he&#39;s busy learning and exploring.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSmacking their hands and shaming them, redirecting,<br/>\nexplaining why eating trash is bad, letting them go ahead and eat the <br/>\ntrash,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best option at this toddler age is probably redirection. Pick him <br/>\nup and move him to a safer location. Get him a cracker.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut your child would *choose* to eat trash and dead birds?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.
