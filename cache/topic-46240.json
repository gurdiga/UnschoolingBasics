About 6 months ago it stopped again. This time luckily I had a defibrilator in place. It went off and all was well. <br/>\nAnother mom lost her daughter a few years back. I don&#39;t know this lady except from reading her blog in the past ...I think the girls name was Hannah. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen ever they do something that makes me want to scream what were you thinking?

It&#39;s a $225 camera. They tried to take care of it last night because dad was home and they didn&#39;t want him to find out. I checked the camera and can&#39;t even get it to come on. I&#39;ve put it in a bag of rice hoping that will help, but I don&#39;t have much hope. I told her (the daughter that actually dropped it) I wish she had come to me last night because I might have been able to save it or at least taken the batteries out and dry the camera. Anyway, she has offered her Christmas money and to work for the difference. I know she feels bad, but I am very upset also. We don&#39;t have the money to replace it and they know better!! I&#39;ve always let them use it but taught them that they need to keep the strap around them so it doesn&#39;t fall. I am struggling to get myself calm and not act like I would have prior to<br/>\n unschooling.
