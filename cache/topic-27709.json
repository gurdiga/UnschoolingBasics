There is one more unschooler in town but even her two older dds are in school right now due to her health and other family reasons.The other one I visit once a month lives about 1:40 minutes away and we can talk and have some good conversations but I need more.My kids need more. Our little homeschooling group is nice but after L & L it just won&#39;t do. Too many talks about curriculum, disabilities, etcMoving is out of the question since our bussiness is our farm and we need to be around here. I would travel more but everyone is so far away and my little dd just hates car drives. Kelli Traaseth, you are like 5 hours away right?????Soooooooo oooooooo. ......I already invited people at AU to come over<br/>\nand visit our Dairy Farm<br/>\nanytime.I want to invite any of you that would like to come spend a few days at our Dairy Farm in SE MN.&#92;My dd will be 2 in January and ds is 5 and loves to play video games ( specially Super Mario).
