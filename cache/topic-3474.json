She knows we spend  more on her activities - her theater, dance, <br/>\nvoice, and books for her community college courses and I think that&#39;s <br/>\nwhy she decided to take a smaller draw from the family funds, probably. <br/>\nLike I said before, we simply listed all the things they&#39;d be <br/>\nresponsible for, gave them approximately the amount of money we were <br/>\nalready spending on those things, and then they were in charge of their <br/>\nown spending on those things. The point was to not have ME in the <br/>\nmiddle trying to evaluate whether they were making sensible purchases <br/>\nor not and for them to have some sense of how much they were spending. <br/>\nFor example, Roya would spend all day every day buying presents for her <br/>\nfriends - they are all over the country and she loves to send them <br/>\ncollaged boxes with all kinds of cute little goodies inside them. She <br/>\ncould spend pretty much any amount of money on that - and it adds up to <br/>\na lot, but each item is just a little. So it was hard for me to say, &quot;I <br/>\nthink that we&#39;re spending too much,&quot; when each time she wanted to <br/>\nspend, it wasn&#39;t very much. Made more sense for us to give her a fixed <br/>\namount of money and let HER decide how much of it she wants to use for <br/>\nthat purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m an easy banker, too. They can borrow from next month&#39;s money any <br/>\ntime. And they do, sometimes. But they keep track of it and then the <br/>\nnext month they&#39;ll say, &quot;Only give me $30, because I already spent $20 <br/>\nof this month&#39;s money.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell you how nice it is to stay OUT of a teenager&#39;s decisions <br/>\nabout how she is spending money. I found that impossible when they had <br/>\nto ask me to give them money (say for clothes) whenever they needed it. <br/>\nBut I find it calm and easy now - actually very interesting to see how <br/>\nthey handle it, each in her own way.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWant MORE unschooling discussion?<br/>\n&lt;www.unschooling.info/forum&gt;<br/>\nLife is Learning; Learning is Life</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":149995806,"authorName":"catherine aceto","from":"&quot;catherine aceto&quot; &lt;aceto3@...&gt;","profile":"cat4cat15217","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Allowance amounts...was: more money questions","postDate":"1097587604","msgId":3530,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOWUwMWM0YjA1ZiQxZTYwYWI1MCQ4NzAyYThjMEAyMDAyZGVza3RvcD4=","referencesHeader":"PGUyLjMxNTkxZWMuMmU5ZDFmZjRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":3527,"nextInTopic":3531,"prevInTime":3529,"nextInTime":3531,"topicId":3474,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"QUOTE: I have seen several times on this list and on many lists  where parents give the child s age in $$ or 1/2 the child s age in $$ and don t understand why","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1611467908\">QUOTE: I have seen several times on this list and on many lists  where <br/>\nparents give the child&#39;s age in $$ or 1/2 the child&#39;s age in $$ and don&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand why an 8 year old gets more than a 6 or 7 year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nME: Oh - that&#39;s something I hadn&#39;t thought about. I have only one child (6) getting an allowance (her brother is not yet two), so it has not been an issue. For us, the $5/week decision came first based on the sort of toys she might want to buy and how much our budget allocated for toy purchases.  It was coincidental that it matched her age at the time. Raising it by a dollar each year was something she asked for when she turned 6 and it seemed to me to be a convenient way of giving her a cost-of-living increase. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had two very similar aged children both getting allowances (say 6 and 9), I would definitely come up with a different way to calculate the allowance for the reasons that you mention.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Lydia is old enough to want to buy expensive clothes, I will go to the same system that Pam describes of turning over more of the budget to her.  Right now she chooses her clothes, but they cost so little that it doesn&#39;t matter if she chooses trendy things that fall apart - we can just buy new ones - and they dont&#39; fit her for more than 6 months anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"Genant2@aol.com","from":"Genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Allowance amounts...was: more money questions","postDate":"1097582068","msgId":3527,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUyLjMxNTkxZWMuMmU5ZDFmZjRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":3523,"nextInTopic":3530,"prevInTime":3526,"nextInTime":3528,"topicId":3474,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"for me  it is a way for them to have their own money to spend or save or use as they  wish...it is not tied to chores in the sense that you have to do x to get","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1715203205\">for me  it is a way for them to have their own money to spend or save or use <br/>\nas they  wish...it is not tied to chores in the sense that you have to do x to <br/>\nget  $...&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI understand the allowance part.

It was <br/>\nthe kids that thought that as they got older the things they wanted got <br/>\nmore expensive (3 kids, 3 years apart) and so that they should get an <br/>\nincrease in spending money as they got older. Their age is convenient - <br/>\nI think they thought it was just a rather clever way to come up with an <br/>\namount. They got their age on the first of each month.  But we dropped <br/>\nthat as they hit the teen years and we talked again about money. It <br/>\nworks out really well for them to get more money and be responsible for <br/>\nmore of their own purchases. This takes ME out of the situation when <br/>\nthey want to buy clothes, especially. Otherwise, if they were wanting <br/>\nto buy some badly-made faddish outfit, I&#39;d always be wanting to talk <br/>\nthem out of it, and we&#39;d have conflict. Now that it is clearly their <br/>\nown personal money, I just tell them how nice they look - the money <br/>\nspending aspect of it is none of my business unless they ask for my <br/>\nadvice (which they often do, and I can give it and they can take it or <br/>\nleave it). They learn very fast how much more value they can get at <br/>\nthrift stores and how sad it is to buy brand new but badly-made <br/>\nclothing that doesn&#39;t last through a laundering. The way we figured out <br/>\nhow much money to give them as their own personal spending money, as <br/>\nthey got older, was to list what they&#39;d be responsible for - clothing, <br/>\ngifts for friends, accessories, postage, movies, cd&#39;s, books, hair dye, <br/>\netc. and then took a look at how much we spent on those kinds of things <br/>\n(we&#39;d been keeping track for quite a while, in fact). Together we <br/>\ndecided what would cover the same level of spending, but we&#39;d hand the <br/>\nkid the money and she could make all the decisions. It has worked <br/>\nextremely well and just sort of phased over into my oldest having a job <br/>\nand she just stopped wanting our money anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - it made it nice that we could buy them gifts - if I bought one <br/>\nof them a cd or a book or a pair of underwear &lt;G&gt; it was appreciated. <br/>\nAnd I do that fairly often.

I would want so badly to NOT spend that <br/>\nmoney on those pants, but she&#39;d really like them and want to buy them. <br/>\nGiving her total control over her own money meant that I could stand <br/>\nthere and say, &quot;Yeah, they&#39;d look great on you, but did you notice that <br/>\nthe fabric is pretty flimsy?&quot; and SHE could decide if they were worth <br/>\nher money or not. Not my decision and no conflict or disagreement <br/>\nbetween us no matter what she decided.  I don&#39;t keep track of how much <br/>\nmoney they have or how they spend it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175155280,"authorName":"Lanie Carlson-Lim","from":"&quot;Lanie Carlson-Lim&quot; &lt;pyxiewytch@...&gt;","profile":"pyxiewytch68","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Allowance amounts...was: more money questions","postDate":"1097552293","msgId":3515,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWIwMWM0YjAwYyRlNzU2ODY0MCQ2NTAxYThjMEBMQVJSWT4=","referencesHeader":"PDJiLjYzNDk3NjZlLjJlOWIxZTc5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3505,"nextInTopic":3523,"prevInTime":3514,"nextInTime":3516,"topicId":3474,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"for me it is a way for them to have their own money to spend or save or use as they wish...it is not tied to chores in the sense that you have to do x to get","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1333744131\">for me it is a way for them to have their own money to spend or save or use as they wish...it is not tied to chores in the sense that you have to do x to get $...but the twelve year old can and does help out with a few more things that he is old enough to do...watching/playing with his sister so I can do??? for a small amount of time...if it&#39;s more of a babysitting situation then he is paid extra ...he was gonna learn to mow, but our mower has been funny lately so that went by the wayside...<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to have regular chores that they did daily as part of family, but it got difficult because sometimes they were with their dad and then things wouldn&#39;t get done, so now I make a general list of things that need to be done and if I need help I ask...this has been hard for me...I used to just do it and then get resentful because no one was helping and when it was assigned i was nagging for it to get done...so i had to learn to just do it and if it gets to be too much ask for help or let it go...they are usually more then willing to help and it goes much smoother because i&#39;m much more pleasant to be around :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLanie<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Genant2@...\">Genant2@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, October 10, 2004 7:23 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Allowance amounts...was: more money questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  they get  their age every other Friday&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just curious and this is not directed at any one individual in particular,  <br/>\n  but how do you decide on the amount?

Emily is wanting CD&#39;s and more control in her own clothes.  Mary Elayne (9yo) hoards all her money (it&#39;s so funny!) and relishes in the fact that she has lot so fmoney to spend while on vacation (she will come back with more than half of it though - my very frugal child).  Keon is happy if he has a little pocket money for a candy bar at the check out stand or a small box of Legos.  He actually ends up spending most of his money on other people (buying gum for his sisters or getting his dad a car smelly thing).  Also, my kids can earn extra money so if there is something that they really need they can do extra to earn the money for it.  I&#39;m not really sure where I came up with $x per age.  It just sort of evolved somehow.  The kids were asking for an allowance (presuming that they had friends who were getting allowance) and in giving it to them it has cut back on how much they are asking for.  They are learning how money works.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKeon, for instance, really wanted this Power Rangers Dino Thunder bracelet thingy (supposedly transforms you into a dinosaur?)  It cost $10.  I told him if he really wanted it he could save up for it and buy it.  So he did.  He proudly bought it, brought it home and then was disappointed that he didn&#39;t turn into a Power Ranger.  And that he had spent $10 to not turn into a Power Ranger.  Of course I spoke to him before he bought it about how it was just a toy and that turning into Power Rangers was part of fiction and pretend and he said he understood it.  I think he just wanted to believe so badly that it would work like it was advertised on television.  This little experience taught him a lot about money.  He had to save for 2 weeks to get it.  It didn&#39;t do like the commercial said (although in very tiny print that most 6yo won&#39;t or can&#39;t read it does say that product will not transform people into giant lizards and is just a toy.)  And he now wishes he had saved that $10 so he would have had $10 more to buy Legos at the Lego Superstore at Disney World next month.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152271008,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"ruekream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Allowance amounts...was: more money questions","postDate":"1097454477","msgId":3492,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNzUwMWM0YWYyOSQyODg1YmRmMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDJiLjYzNDk3NjZlLjJlOWIxZTc5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3488,"nextInTopic":3505,"prevInTime":3491,"nextInTime":3493,"topicId":3474,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... it is used, all participate in figuring out what bills need to be paid, how much to  save for emergencies, vacations, spending etc. **This is what we do","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1906483252\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;We don&#39;t use allowances, the money is family money and we all decide how<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it<br/>\nis used, all participate in figuring out what bills need to be paid, how<br/>\nmuch<br/>\nto  save for emergencies, vacations, spending etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n**This is what we do too, but Dagny and Rowan do like to have a scheduled<br/>\namount of cash coming to them.
