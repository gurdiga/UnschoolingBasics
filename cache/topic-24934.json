I would suggest either going to Dallas or Fort Worth. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Dallas has a great indy used bookstore- Paperbacks Plus. There are lots of great shops and restaurants in that area too. The headquarters for Half Price Books is also in Dallas, and they have an inexpensive coffee shop onsite, and lots of great places to sit and read, work, write, or whatever. You might be able to catch a poetry reading there on the right night. The Dallas Farmers Market is also a great place to shop. They have everything from jewelry and furniture to local organic produce.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I don&#39;t know Fort Worth as well, despite growing up there. We live in Frisco, which is north of Dallas. But we go down to Dallas quite a bit. My writing group meets at Paperbacks Plus. I&#39;ll ask around about thrift stores.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hope this helps!<br/>\n  :-)  Jennifer<br/>\n<br/>\nRen Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          This is for anyone who knows the Dallas area or lives there....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m traveling to Dallas next month for the RE conference and plan to<br/>\ngo a day early to do some sightseeing.
