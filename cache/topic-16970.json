I was a pretty conventional parent - did the <br/>\ntimeout thing as toddlers instead of spanking, set bedtimes, and <br/>\nmade bad food choices with my children.  Until about 2 months ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters are 4 & 7.  They never been to school.  We did do <br/>\ncurriculum when my oldest daughter was 5 but that didn&#39;t turn out <br/>\ntoo well.  That&#39;s when I turned to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love unschool for homeschooling - it&#39;s been great following their <br/>\ninterests - frogs, lizards, turtles for my youngest and my oldest is <br/>\ninto costumes, paper dolls, dressing up, and styling our hair.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to incorporate our unschooling in other things like food <br/>\nchoices and bedtimes.  Bedtimes haven&#39;t really been a big deal since <br/>\nmy youngest was born.  She taught me that she could really sleep <br/>\nanytime anywhere.  Food choices were a bigger deal for my hubby, but <br/>\nhe is now embracing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thing is sharing.  I don&#39;t make them share their toys with each <br/>\nother - my oldest has a keyboard and my youngest has a doodle pad <br/>\nthat they bought themselves with birthday money.  They do have toys <br/>\nthat they both play with - blocks, playdough, puzzles, games, cards, <br/>\ncars, barbies, etc.  And usually they share well with that. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problems occur regarding the computer and television.  Now my <br/>\nchildren both love playing games online and on the computer and love <br/>\nwatching TV (like Animal Planet for my youngest), but my oldest <br/>\nsometimes refuses to share.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my youngest daughter (whom is very shy and introverted) is <br/>\nplaying on the computer my oldest will boss her around telling her <br/>\nthat its wrong or her picture doesn&#39;t match.  My youngest doesn&#39;t <br/>\n(can&#39;t?) stick up for herself so I try to intervene.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI try to explain that we all have to take turns and share, she rolls <br/>\nher eyes at me and shrugs her shoulders and starts to whine and <br/>\ncomplain.  I try asking her if she needs something from mom and she <br/>\nsays &quot;just leave me alone&quot;.  I want to be respectful of her and her <br/>\nwishes, but I can&#39;t let her be rude and disrespectful to her sister <br/>\nor me.  I try to offer other activities - like reading a book with <br/>\nher, playing a game or watching TV (if little sister is on the <br/>\ncomputer).  But she just stomps off (did I mention she is very <br/>\ndramatic?) to her room or sulks in the corner.  She doesn&#39;t want to <br/>\nbe close to me or anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a lot of this is from being &quot;controlled&quot; in the past by me <br/>\nand her dad.  I know that ** I WANT ** her to respect other members <br/>\nof our &quot;tribe&quot; but I know ** I CAN&#39;T MAKE ** her.  But I also can&#39;t <br/>\nstand by and let her walk all over her sister - bossing her around, <br/>\ntaking over her games or puzzles, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAdvice on how to reach a solution that is best for all members of <br/>\nour tribe?<br/>\n<br/>\nCara :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16988,"nextTopicId":16999}}
