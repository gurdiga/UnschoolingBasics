In other words, how do<br/>\n&gt; you generally go about digging up possible resources that your kids<br/>\n&gt; might be interested in for things they&#39;ve expressed interest in, or<br/>\n&gt; thinking up ways they might enjoy expanding those interests.  And<br/>\n&gt; how much do you leave up to them?  Is this something that has varied<br/>\n&gt; over your years of unschooling with insight you have gained in the<br/>\n&gt; process of unschooling?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ******You are your children&#39;s guide, but think about what a guide<br/>\n&gt; does. If you go to a museum and a guide takes you to the different<br/>\n&gt; displays he doesn&#39;t force you to look at each piece and study it and<br/>\n&gt; write a report. He simply points it out to you and allows you the<br/>\n&gt; freedom to put as much attention and effort into that piece as you<br/>\n&gt; choose. He doesn&#39;t tell you that he will show you the next piece if<br/>\n&gt; you say &quot;please&quot; or tell you that you don&#39;t get to see the next<br/>\n&gt; piece because you didn&#39;t say &quot;thank you&quot; when he showed you the<br/>\n&gt; prior piece. He doesn&#39;t tell you to be quiet and stay in a straight<br/>\n&gt; line with your hands at your side. He doesn&#39;t monitor you to see<br/>\n&gt; what you&#39;ve learned and degrade you if you were not interested. He<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t put conditions on sharing his knowledge. What he does do is<br/>\n&gt; share his joy (if he&#39;s a good guide) of the museum and trust you to<br/>\n&gt; take away what you will from the experience. That is the type of<br/>\n&gt; guide our children need and deserve. They need a guide that trusts<br/>\n&gt; them, respects them and is there to answer any questions they might<br/>\n&gt; have about this great world of ours.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; love, Valerie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
