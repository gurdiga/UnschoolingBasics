Like I said there are some very strong <br/>\nand valid reasons to let her finish these last 2 weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it has been challenging for her, but I have seen her grow in <br/>\nsome very important ways this year. For example, she has learned <br/>\nthat even when she FEELS grumpy, she should still treat others with <br/>\nrespect. I watch her do it and it amazes me! <br/>\n<br/>\nShe WANTS to finish the year. It&#39;s not a decision made because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t understand that institutionalization isn&#39;t good for her. But <br/>\nin reality this situation isn&#39;t completly without its benefits for <br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, life in large part is learning how to bounce back when we <br/>\ndon&#39;t always make the decisions we should have to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND, I don&#39;t totally regret this  year. It has taught me some very <br/>\nstrong and lasting lessons which will HUGELY benefit my babies. I am <br/>\nsure it has done the same for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the input.<br/>\nNaomi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, zenmomma@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes, she could.

Being able to learn from our past is very important.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this were any other school, I wouldn&#39;t be a stickler for staying <br/>\nin. But it isn&#39;t. And the people she attends school with (teachers, <br/>\nstudents, and volunteers, and other parents) are all people she has <br/>\nbuilt meaningful relationships with. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have problems with children being mean to one another any <br/>\nmore than you might see siblings argue. It&#39;s the only place on earth <br/>\nlike, I am sure. And the school only goes up to the 6th grade. My <br/>\ndaughter is in 4th grade and neither she nor the children in her <br/>\nclass are much interested in cool. It&#39;s NOTHING like any other <br/>\nprivate school or public school I have ever seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur problem here isn&#39;t the other kids, or her inability to maintin <br/>\nher values taught in our home. What our problem is, is the amount of <br/>\nschool work and classroom time and hours of homework, and lack of <br/>\nsleep or play time. I consider the approach cruel. But many children <br/>\ncome out of this school, well developed, high acheivers. Tired. But <br/>\ngood kids and I know this because I have attend our synagogue (and <br/>\nam friends) with many of the children who have been through it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have pulled her from school before. But the situation is different <br/>\nhere. Even she agrees that she should finish the year. Pretty decent <br/>\ninsight for a 10 year old. She knows I don&#39;t worry much about what <br/>\nshe gets on her reprot card, tests, etc...I only care that she <br/>\ntries. And you know what? She does well.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the education I want her to have is that just because <br/>\nsomething is difficult for a time, doesn&#39;t mean one should just bail <br/>\non it. If this were a &quot;years on end&quot; type thing, we could <br/>\nreconsider. <br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, I AM pulling her out. I am NOT forcing her to finish the <br/>\nnext 2 years at the school.
