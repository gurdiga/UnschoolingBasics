I have been dealing with many life struggles as you <br/>\nobviously have, however, one of my missing links, is my family.  My parents <br/>\nwere very controlling and judgmental, conservative administrators in a public <br/>\nschool system, with lots of rules and ideas about how things &#39;should&#39; be.  <br/>\nAccording to them, if a child didn&#39;t toe the line, they were destined to a life of <br/>\nmisery.  Nothing was worse than being a &#39;misfit.&quot;  Although they considered <br/>\nthemselves to be educated, my folks had no tolerance for divergent thinkers or <br/>\neccentric adults.  And anyone with problems had themselves to blame, for not <br/>\ngoing along with all of society&#39;s rules!  <br/>\nSo, while I did my chores instead of playing, slept on time instead of <br/>\nreading late, did homework instead of watching TV, and made good grades in school, <br/>\nexcelled in drama, gymnastics, art, choir and other electives, I resented their <br/>\nrigidness.  We had a housekeeper and a gardener, because my parents had more <br/>\nimportant things to do.  It was like they had forgotten how to have fun.  <br/>\nSo perhaps that is how I did not learn to think quickly, or cope with the <br/>\nunexpected (good or bad), as everything was plotted out and demanded.  These are <br/>\nthings I am teaching myself belatedly as an adult.<br/>\nSheesh, they barely know their grandchildren, and we only speak once or twice <br/>\na year now, from a very long distance.  It&#39;s a long and winding road, but it <br/>\nstarted somewhere.<br/>\nNO MORE FORCED CHORES AND MANIPULATIONS.  I so wish my parents had known <br/>\nsomething about joyful encouragement, working WITH their children, and relaxing <br/>\nenough to enjoy us beyond our accomplishments.<br/>\nBird</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210848982,"authorName":"Paige","from":"&quot;Paige&quot; &lt;paigehughes1972@...&gt;","profile":"paigehughes1972","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Being &quot;my kid&#39;s slave&quot;","postDate":"1142828532","msgId":10915,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR2bGFsaytrb2NrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwMzE5MTkyMDQ1Ljc3MTUxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjMwMzA5Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":10909,"nextInTopic":10917,"prevInTime":10914,"nextInTime":10916,"topicId":10891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There are some things in ...

It has to do with you either having unrealistic expectations of what being a parent is or not knowing how to meet your own needs.  For example, my 15yo has a part time job that I drive her to 4 days per week, which means we have to cut short anywhere we go so we can be back so I can drive Adriane.  She wanted to add another day to her workweek.  I really didn&#39;t want to have to be available another day so i told her so.  We brainstormed other ways for her to get to work, etc.<br/>\nI could have just driven another day but I would have been crabby about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are feeling like a slave, you need to take a long look at your boundaries and expectations.  It is not your kids&#39; job to make you feel like a whole and honored person, it is up to you to do that and the only way to have that happen is by interacting with others through love and compassion.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.--apparently soapboxes abound.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Saturday, March 18, 2006 6:43 pm<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] I&#39;m new and unsure<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ~Children don&#39;t think &quot;I&#39;m going to make a<br/>\n&gt; mess and I&#39;m going to leave it for my mom because I want her to <br/>\n&gt; feel <br/>\n&gt; likemy slave.&quot;   They play.
