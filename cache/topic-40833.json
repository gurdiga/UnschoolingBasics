And, as it feels like parenting comes with such huge responsibilities for the grown child your child will someday become, the outcomes seem to be the whole point. So when you are taking the road less travelled it feels like you are using your child as guinea pig for some new and largely unproven method of parenting and educating. I fully understand why you&#39;ve come here and asked questions about outcomes. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth is that even the traditional methods are largely unproven. School is a novel game and they keep changing the rules and the curriculum and the approach as they go. Hoping that somehow these institions will get it all right and will be able to guarantee that everyone has the same opportunities as everyone else and stays enchanted with compulsory learning for at least the first 16 or 18 years of their lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is far more about today than it is about tomorrow. At Life is Good I bought a bumper sticker that says &quot;Unschooling for a Better Today&quot;. I love that bumper sticker. It&#39;s really hard to trust that if you make today better tomorrow is more likely to be better than if you are aiming for a better tomorrow. But it really does seem to work that way. And as awful as it is to say, tomorrow doesn&#39;t always come. And for those parents who have had to wake up the next day without their babies knowing that each today was good is far better than having aimed for the tomorrow. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: aimeemwheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:apmama@...\">apmama@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, 2 August, 2009 2:04:57 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: New to the group with some questions about unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much everyone!  Your answers were very helpful.  I know it seems silly to be concerned w/ a lot of this stuff so early on but I think we just don&#39;t want to get to that point and say oh we never thought about that.  Not that is won&#39;t all change 100 times between now and then anyway.  I guess we are just trying to get comfortable with trusting there are options out there as this will be a major departure from our traditional support structure.  One I think we are up for but want to be prepared for.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I even went so far as to enroll in an online Montessori course - to learn the theory and some of the practice of classical Montessori education. Some of the basic theory is close to unschooling (follow the child, observe *before* you interfere... that sort of thing). I totally recommend any parent who is worried about academics and the &quot;how tos&quot; of autodidactism to do a bit of your own for awhile. It helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all being said, not all parents are willing to do that - I don&#39;t mean that in a snarky &quot;some people&quot; sort of way, I mean that its not  a good strategy for everyone. It doesn&#39;t fit the way everyone learns. Some dads (or working moms for that matter) do better with information presented in &quot;sound bites&quot; or articles left in the bathroom. Others do better by taking a deep breath and deciding that they can trust this other person to make good parenting decisions and learn by observation. There are many ways for adults to learn! Others mostly need reassurance and more ways to connect with the family - beyond &quot;what did you learn today.&quot; Just like kids, it can help a lot to think about how mom and dad learn and process information.

How does all of this work with college and the college admissions process requesting GPA, transcripts, etc?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;HOW does it all work out?  I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s a mystery!&quot; (Shakespeare in Love quote)  But it does work out, and here&#39;s what you need to know right now: it will surprise you no matter how well you think you&#39;ve planned, which goes double or triple for schooling toward college, btw, so don&#39;t kid yourselves about that! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3.  What happens if our son decides later that he wants to go to school.  What is the process like to get him enrolled, how would they determine what grade he would be in etc?  Is it different for public and private schools?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See answer above. But if you&#39;re curious for personal examples of how it worked out for other unschoolers, I guess it could help pass the many years before you&#39;ll learn how it all works out for your own two-year-old &lt;grin&gt;.

How does all of this work with college and the college admissions process requesting GPA, transcripts, etc?<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n </span></blockquote>We make it work. I have one graduated from college (CSULB), one <br/>\ncurrently a junior at UC Irvine, and one going to Cypress College and <br/>\nplanning to transfer to CSU Northridge. There are just about as many <br/>\nways of handling college as there are unschoolers in college - and it <br/>\nisn&#39;t at all uncommon. But, it is TOO soon for you to think about it at <br/>\nall. Seriously. Just know it can be and often is done. About the time <br/>\nyour son is the age where he&#39;d be entering high school, then maybe you <br/>\ncan think about it and consider the options at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2.

I worked as a consultant (I&#39;m an <br/>\neconomist/statistician) on energy conservation projects for quite a few <br/>\nyears. Mostly I worked from home - I learned to breastfeed while typing <br/>\non the computer when I came up against some deadlines, but mostly I <br/>\nworked when the kids were busy. I did hire a mothers helper to be here <br/>\nwith the kids for a couple of hours a day for a while. Later, I taught <br/>\ncommunity college courses - I taught weekend and evening classes so that <br/>\nmy husband was home with the kids while I was working.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3.  What happens if our son decides later that he wants to go to school.  What is the process like to get him enrolled, how would they determine what grade he would be in etc?  Is it different for public and private schools?<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n </span></blockquote>For public schools - they have to take him. You enroll him by showing up <br/>\nand saying, &quot;Here we are.&quot; &lt;G&gt; If he enters school before high school, <br/>\nthey just put him in a grade level based on his age. If he enters after <br/>\n9th grade, they&#39;ll decide if they are going to give him credits or not. <br/>\nAgain, why don&#39;t you wait until the time comes and worry about it then. <br/>\nToo soon. Anything before 9th grade doesn&#39;t matter and if you make it <br/>\nthat far, the chances are that you would not even consider him going to <br/>\nschool and, even if you did, community college might be preferable.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrivate schools - they make their own rules and it all depends on the <br/>\nschool - there are elite ones that the kid will have to pass a test to <br/>\nget into and others that take anybody who can pay and so on.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4.

Our son is pretty athletic for a 2 yr old so I think my husband has visions of college scholarships dancing in his head. Should he want to play organized sports at HS age what are his options?  Are there non-school teams that he could participate on or would he be able to participate in school athletics without attending school?    Just curious as to how that would work since I guess college scouts would typically see someone at high school games.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks Again!<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Seriously? I&#39;m giggling. He&#39;s two. Worry about this later. There are <br/>\ntons of club sports for him to participate in up until high school and <br/>\neven then, depending on the sport. I have a very athletic child - she&#39;s <br/>\n18 and plays soccer and has a black belt in karate. She now coaches <br/>\nyounger girls soccer and is a karate instructor. All three of mine were <br/>\non swim teams, when they were younger. If he&#39;s into swimming or <br/>\ngymnastics or quite a few other sports, then clubs are more important <br/>\nthan high school teams. They can also play sports at community colleges <br/>\nand move from there to major universities with sports scholarships. It <br/>\nisn&#39;t common, but some high schools HAVE allowed homeschooled kids to <br/>\nplay. Sometimes homeschoolers join public school independent study <br/>\nprograms in order to be eligible for sports teams. There are options. <br/>\nWho knows, maybe his physical coordination will turn into a love of <br/>\ndance, not sports.

We have just begun our research.  So far everything I have read really resonates with me but we have some questions that I think can only be answered by experienced unschoolers.  So please look them over and answer what you can.  We greatly appreciate it! BTW... we live in Los Angeles if that is helpful in anyway<br/>\nAimee<br/>\n1.  How does all of this work with college and the college admissions process requesting GPA, transcripts, etc?<br/>\n2.  I am a psychologist and while I don&#39;t want to work full time I do want the ability to work part time.  For some reason I can&#39;t quite figure out how I am suppose to coordinate that.  Any feed back from working moms would be fabulous.<br/>\n3.  What happens if our son decides later that he wants to go to school.  What is the process like to get him enrolled, how would they determine what grade he would be in etc?  Is it different for public and private schools?<br/>\n4.  Athletics....Let me preface this by saying I am sooooo not one of those over involved athletic parents. Our son is pretty athletic for a 2 yr old so I think my husband has visions of college scholarships dancing in his head. Should he want to play organized sports at HS age what are his options?  Are there non-school teams that he could participate on or would he be able to participate in school athletics without attending school?    Just curious as to how that would work since I guess college scouts would typically see someone at high school games.   <br/>\nThanks Again!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40832,"nextTopicId":40878}}
