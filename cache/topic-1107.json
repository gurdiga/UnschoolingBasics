Surfing?<br/>\n<br/>\n*****Referred from another list.  I think it might have been Always<br/>\nLearning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you coming to unschooling from attachment parenting----like Robyn and<br/>\nRue and Deb? Or are you coming into it from a schooling background, like me<br/>\nand<br/>\nPam and Ren?<br/>\n<br/>\n*************comiing from attachment parenting but I did have Alex in a<br/>\npreschool Tues. Thurs. mornings at the insistence of his father.  It took<br/>\none year for dad to change his mind and become 100% supportive of fulltime<br/>\nunschooling.  I do still struggle with a total no limits approach at home<br/>\nthough.  I am not ready for that yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you looking at unschooling as a means of &quot;education&quot; only? Or do you<br/>\nfind it emcompassing your lives? Do you want to limit it to educational<br/>\nthings?<br/>\nOr do you want it as a lifestyle?<br/>\n<br/>\n***********Good question.  Still iffy about it encompasing entire life.  I<br/>\nbelieve in boundaries in regard to a messy house.  Food is something I offer<br/>\nand try to focus on healthy choices but if he wants cookies after toast<br/>\nthat&#39;s fine with me.  Sleep is something that we do together.  Regardless of<br/>\nwhether he sleeps with dad or not he usually falls asleep around 9:30 or<br/>\n10:100 and wakes up around 9:00.  I felt very guilty forcing him to wake up<br/>\nto attend school last year and do not want to go through that again.  I am<br/>\ncoercive at times.  Yesterday, in 94 degree weather, I asked him to come to<br/>\nthe shady area on the blanket, have some water and cool down.  So I do<br/>\ninterfere at times and set limits for his health so he does not get over<br/>\nheated but he is four and that is where I am with it at the moment.  I guess<br/>\nI am in a still learning along the way mode and unsure because the<br/>\ndefinitions still seem sort of vague to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n We want you to feel comfortable enough to ask anything, but at the same<br/>\ntime, to be accepting of all the answers you get. Each answer may not fit<br/>\nyour<br/>\nparticular situation, but there might be something there for the *next*<br/>\nreader----so it&#39;s just as valuable, just not necessarily to *you*.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, to those of you clinging on to the edge of the pool, we&#39;re here in the<br/>\nmiddle yelling. &quot;The water&#39;s FINE!&quot; We&#39;re fairly trustworthy. I promise!<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n**** I do hesitate sometime&#39;s because I have an underlying fear if I<br/>\ndisagree or share my life situation I am going to be screamed at and told to<br/>\ngo away and that I am not a true unschooler.  Sink or swim I am jumping in.<br/>\n<br/>\nKay</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1099,"nextTopicId":1112}}
