Someone was trying to help someone with <br/>\nself directed learning and this is what they wrote...<br/>\n<br/>\nThey said they inschool. But I some of this bothered me. What do you <br/>\nall this of it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your time,<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\nself directed learning <br/>\n<br/>\nOur oldest is only 8, so I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be where you <br/>\nare. On the other hand, I have some approaches to &#39;learning&#39; that you <br/>\nmay or may not<br/>\nwant to try:<br/>\n<br/>\n*Asking questions.* A few times I&#39;ve simply asked &quot;what do you want <br/>\nto learn more about / or do?&quot;. It&#39;s usually surprising what they <br/>\nanswer with. We can&#39;t read their minds, and somehow it doesn&#39;t occur <br/>\nto us to ask this simple question often enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Setting time limits.* Sometimes the limits are arbitrary, sometimes <br/>\nnot. These days it might be TV time that ends at a certain time, and <br/>\nthe sooner you finish eating, brushing teeth and getting into <br/>\npajamas, the longer you get to watch. Time limits can be used as an <br/>\nincentive, to avoid having to push them into doing what they need to <br/>\ndo. Carrots instead of sticks, at least not sticks all the time :-|<br/>\n<br/>\n*Empowerment. * I&#39;ll do my best to give them tools and <br/>\nresponsibilities that they can handle on their own. Anything from <br/>\ngiving them their own scissors and stapler, to their own &#39;garden <br/>\nplot&#39; in our yard somewhere. If they can &#39;own&#39; it then they have more <br/>\npower, and more of a reason to explore those areas to their own <br/>\nliking.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Explaining stuff.* This often requires me to be in a quiet room with <br/>\nonly one of the kids. Then I can explain detailed stuff like cell-<br/>\ndivision, how stars are made, what happens to the mail to get if from <br/>\nhere to there, the theory of evolution, heavy-duty stuff like that. <br/>\nIf it catches their attention, I just keep going until they fall <br/>\nasleep :-) I figure if I can get a big mental model inserted into <br/>\ntheir heads, they now have a new reference system to hang other <br/>\nthoughts on, or ask questions about.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Talking about the future.* I always wonder what might happen in the <br/>\nfuture, and I think kids do this to an even greater degree, since <br/>\nthey have so much more ahead of them. I&#39;ll start a conversation and <br/>\nexplore what might happen in the future, with them, with me, the <br/>\nfamily, other friends etc. This also helps to deal with certain <br/>\ndifficult situations, like when we moved from California to <br/>\nWashington. My oldest knows that she can be pen pals with her<br/>\nfriends that are still in California, so she has options to exercise <br/>\nif she wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Earning things.* I try to incorporate this in various ways. Treats <br/>\nare not free, and the more you &#39;do&#39; the more you deserve to <br/>\nbe &#39;rewarded&#39;. Our kids like to buy little toys at the store, and I <br/>\nmake them use their own money for that. This way, they actually care <br/>\nabout the toys, won&#39;t let them go to waste, and they also pick up <br/>\nmath skills since they need to know how much money to bring, what <br/>\nthey can afford, and always remembering that sales are added at the <br/>\ncash register. We have various ways for the kids to earn money,<br/>\neven having them make stuff and selling them to us. We basically have <br/>\na mini-economy going on.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Handing out things.* Especially with my 8-year old, I try to print <br/>\nout things from the computer that I think might interest her, and I <br/>\nsimply hand it to her. Some times she reads it, other times not. Some <br/>\ntimes she&#39;ll ask me to read it to her. She is now accustomed to <br/>\ngetting &#39;weird stuff&#39; from me, and never knows what to expect. I&#39;m <br/>\nnot really sure what this is teaching her, but I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s a <br/>\ngood idea anyway, to let her get information about random stuff from <br/>\ntime to time, and having to evaluate it herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Posing hypothetical questions.* Sometimes I&#39;ll ask things like &quot;What <br/>\nwould it be like to eat dinner *backwards*? , or what about <br/>\n*sideways*?&quot; , or something like &quot;What would we do if we ran out of <br/>\ngas in the car right now?&quot;. I try to jog their minds a little from <br/>\ntime to time, to get them a new and different challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Video taping them, and showing them.* I don&#39;t do this often, but <br/>\nit&#39;s been quite effective. I&#39;ll especially do this when one of them <br/>\ngets into a bad habit and won&#39;t admit to it themselves. Instead of <br/>\nyelling or nagging, it&#39;s easy and powerful to record their bad <br/>\nbehavior and then show it to them. It&#39;s objective and fair, but <br/>\ncertainly unpleasant to them, but so is their bad habits to us...<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, those are the ones I could think of. We probably do other things <br/>\ntoo, but I can&#39;t think of them right now...<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Came from another list","postDate":"1213794039","msgId":33850,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGczYjB0bis4dDNpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDQTlGNEVGMjc4MEJFMy0xM0QwLTU4M0B3ZWJtYWlsLWRhMDIuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":33848,"nextInTopic":33856,"prevInTime":33849,"nextInTime":33851,"topicId":33842,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~ Has deliberate, calculated humiliation *ever* not harmed a relationship?

When we  <br/>\ntake on a responsibility, we get to choose to what standards we&#39;ll  <br/>\nkeep it. As kids grow, they can see a bigger picture, and appreciate  <br/>\nthat if they take on such and such a task that they&#39;ll disappoint  <br/>\nother people if they don&#39;t follow through and people will think less  <br/>\nof them. It&#39;s not a &quot;fact&quot; that they need handed to them, but an  <br/>\nunderstanding they grow into as they get older and mature enough to  <br/>\ngrasp it. (And will happen at different ages for different kids.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor unschoolers, it&#39;s much better to be there for them as a resource  <br/>\nas they take on responsibilities. By getting to know our kids we&#39;ll  <br/>\nget a better handle on when it&#39;s helpful to step in and help and when  <br/>\nit&#39;s helpful to step back and let them figure out what works and what  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t from what they&#39;re trying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; *Explaining stuff.* This often requires me to be in a quiet room with<br/>\n&gt; only one of the kids.

(If she did, she wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nevery think of cutting off a child&#39;s TV time!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than giving a lecture to a child, it will help unschooling to  <br/>\nexpose them to a wide variety of stuff and steer more of what lights  <br/>\ntheir eyes toward them, and less of what dulls them. (Put the less  <br/>\ninteresting to them stuff on the back burner and bring it out once in  <br/>\na while. Kids interests change.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; *Talking about the future.* I always wonder what might happen in the<br/>\n&gt; future, and I think kids do this to an even greater degree, since<br/>\n&gt; they have so much more ahead of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Adults would like to think so!

But it&#39;s more helpful to approach it from a &quot;How  <br/>\ncan I help them?&quot; point of view rather than &quot;This is something that&#39;s  <br/>\ngood for them.&quot; The first is flexible and adaptable to the child&#39;s  <br/>\nneeds and personality.

At a certain age, for my daughter, having the  <br/>\nmoney just felt like a hoop to jump through to bring home what she  <br/>\nwanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see where her thoughts are that if toys are flowing in like  <br/>\nwater, they get treated like water, as something disposable. But did  <br/>\nit really happen and why? Rather than controlling the kids --  <br/>\nchanging to kids to solve a problem she created -- it&#39;s better to  <br/>\nlook at her own behavior that created the flow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and they also pick up<br/>\n&gt; math skills since they need to know how much money to bring, what<br/>\n&gt; they can afford, and always remembering that sales are added at the<br/>\n&gt; cash register.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For unschoolers, it&#39;s more helpful to think in terms of helping them  <br/>\nget what they want and living life than the lessons that can be  <br/>\nlearned from an imposed solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We have various ways for the kids to earn money,<br/>\n&gt; even having them make stuff and selling them to us.

Supply without the demand ;-) Though I bet an  <br/>\nentrepreneurial kid might like the incentive of figuring out what  <br/>\npeople wanted and creating something to fill that need to earn extra  <br/>\ncash. (But not as a primary source of income.) But as a hoop to jump  <br/>\nthrough for my daughter to get what she wanted, *she* would have  <br/>\nthought it was bogus.<br/>\n<br/>\n(One of the problems with made up situations that supposedly mimic  <br/>\nreal life is that kids often learn some lesson other than the one the  <br/>\nparents want them to learn. With the above, it&#39;s likely kids will  <br/>\nlearn the attitude of &quot;I&#39;ve got it and you can&#39;t have it until I make  <br/>\nyou jump the right way.&quot; And they&#39;ll learn that having is power over  <br/>\npeople, and not having is powerless and stinks.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; *Handing out things.* Especially with my 8-year old, I try to print<br/>\n&gt; out things from the computer that I think might interest her, and I<br/>\n&gt; simply hand it to her.

Or would she only print out  <br/>\nlists of dinosaurs because dinosaurs are &quot;educational&quot; and Pokemon  <br/>\naren&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a good thing to examine and ask yourself if you&#39;d be as helpful  <br/>\nwith something the child likes but you don&#39;t value as you would with  <br/>\nsomething you value.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd strewing involves anything and anything that a parent might think  <br/>\na child would find interesting.

Someone was trying to help someone with <br/>\nself directed learning and this is what they wrote...<br/>\n<br/>\nThey said they inschool. But I some of this bothered me. What do you <br/>\nall this of it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your time,<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nself directed learning <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOur oldest is only 8, so I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be where you <br/>\nare. On the other hand, I have some approaches to &#39;learning&#39; that you <br/>\nmay or may not<br/>\nwant to try:<br/>\n<br/>\n*Asking questions.* A few times I&#39;ve simply asked &quot;what do you want <br/>\nto learn more about / or do?&quot;. It&#39;s usually surprising what they <br/>\nanswer with. We can&#39;t read their minds, and somehow it doesn&#39;t occur <br/>\nto us to ask this simple question often enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Setting time limits.* Sometimes the limits are arbitrary, sometimes <br/>\nnot. These days it might be TV time that ends at a certain time, and <br/>\nthe sooner you finish eating, brushing teeth and getting into <br/>\npajamas, the longer you get to watch. Time limits can be used as an <br/>\nincentive, to avoid having to push them into doing what they need to <br/>\ndo. Carrots instead of sticks, at least not sticks all the time :-|<br/>\n<br/>\n*Empowerment.* I&#39;ll do my best to give them tools and <br/>\nresponsibilities that they can handle on their own. Anything from <br/>\ngiving them their own scissors and stapler, to their own &#39;garden <br/>\nplot&#39; in our yard somewhere. If they can &#39;own&#39; it then they have more <br/>\npower, and more of a reason to explore those areas to their own <br/>\nliking.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Explaining stuff.* This often requires me to be in a quiet room with <br/>\nonly one of the kids. Then I can explain detailed stuff like cell-<br/>\ndivision, how stars are made, what happens to the mail to get if from <br/>\nhere to there, the theory of evolution, heavy-duty stuff like that. <br/>\nIf it catches their attention, I just keep going until they fall <br/>\nasleep :-) I figure if I can get a big mental model inserted into <br/>\ntheir heads, they now have a new reference system to hang other <br/>\nthoughts on, or ask questions about.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Talking about the future.* I always wonder what might happen in the <br/>\nfuture, and I think kids do this to an even greater degree, since <br/>\nthey have so much more ahead of them. I&#39;ll start a conversation and <br/>\nexplore what might happen in the future, with them, with me, the <br/>\nfamily, other friends etc. This also helps to deal with certain <br/>\ndifficult situations, like when we moved from California to <br/>\nWashington. My oldest knows that she can be pen pals with her<br/>\nfriends that are still in California, so she has options to exercise <br/>\nif she wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Earning things.* I try to incorporate this in various ways. Treats <br/>\nare not free, and the more you &#39;do&#39; the more you deserve to <br/>\nbe &#39;rewarded&#39;. Our kids like to buy little toys at the store, and I <br/>\nmake them use their own money for that. This way, they actually care <br/>\nabout the toys, won&#39;t let them go to waste, and they also pick up <br/>\nmath skills since they need to know how much money to bring, what <br/>\nthey can afford, and always remembering that sales are added at the <br/>\ncash register. We have various ways for the kids to earn money,<br/>\neven having them make stuff and selling them to us. We basically have <br/>\na mini-economy going on.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Handing out things.* Especially with my 8-year old, I try to print <br/>\nout things from the computer that I think might interest her, and I <br/>\nsimply hand it to her. Some times she reads it, other times not. Some <br/>\ntimes she&#39;ll ask me to read it to her. She is now accustomed to <br/>\ngetting &#39;weird stuff&#39; from me, and never knows what to expect. I&#39;m <br/>\nnot really sure what this is teaching her, but I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s a <br/>\ngood idea anyway, to let her get information about random stuff from <br/>\ntime to time, and having to evaluate it herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Posing hypothetical questions.* Sometimes I&#39;ll ask things like &quot;What <br/>\nwould it be like to eat dinner *backwards*?, or what about <br/>\n*sideways*?&quot;, or something like &quot;What would we do if we ran out of <br/>\ngas in the car right now?&quot;. I try to jog their minds a little from <br/>\ntime to time, to get them a new and different challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Video taping them, and showing them.* I don&#39;t do this often, but <br/>\nit&#39;s been quite effective. I&#39;ll especially do this when one of them <br/>\ngets into a bad habit and won&#39;t admit to it themselves. Instead of <br/>\nyelling or nagging, it&#39;s easy and powerful to record their bad <br/>\nbehavior and then show it to them. It&#39;s objective and fair, but <br/>\ncertainly unpleasant to them, but so is their bad habits to us...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, those are the ones I could think of. We probably do other things <br/>\ntoo, but I can&#39;t think of them right now...</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33843,"nextTopicId":825}}
