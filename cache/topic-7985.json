We have Persian  <br/>\nfolk music playing softly in the background. We have all kinds of  <br/>\ntraditional things to eat - dried fruits, nuts and seeds, especially,  <br/>\nbut also Persian cookies and always some fresh melon. We play cards  <br/>\nsometimes, early in the evening. Then we get out all our books of  <br/>\nPersian legends and folk tales and we read aloud from them. I always  <br/>\nhave some kind of crafty thing to do that is related to either the  <br/>\nwinter season, the sun, or Persian culture. For example, we painted  <br/>\nPersian miniatures one year, we&#39;ve made candles, we&#39;ve cut fancy  <br/>\nsnowflakes....last year we made mosaic stepping stones (Persians are  <br/>\nfamous for their mosaic work).  Late in the evening we bake potatoes  <br/>\nin the fireplace - often we roast chestnuts.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting it down, it doesn&#39;t sound that exciting - most of it is my  <br/>\nhusband reading or telling stories, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody goes off to bed - they just fall asleep all cuddled up there  <br/>\nin front of the fire.

Judaism doesn&#39;t have a <br/>\nsolstice celebration (Hanukkah isn&#39;t really &#39;up there&#39; in religious <br/>\nimportance except for how it&#39;s been hyped to match up with <br/>\nChristmas). Neither does Islam as far as I know. Buddhism, as far as <br/>\nI know, doesn&#39;t really have any &#39;celebrations&#39; as such (since it is <br/>\nmore a philosophy than a &#39;religion&#39;). Earth-based belief systems <br/>\ncelebrate solstice but they tend not to fit easily into <br/>\ndefinable &#39;religions&#39; as much. They are belief systems with the <br/>\nparticipant/practitioner choosing which beliefs and practices they <br/>\nwant to follow, emphaize, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb<br/>\n(hope I phrased things delicately enough to not tweak anyone&#39;s <br/>\nbelief system)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175529137,"authorName":"Donald and Sandra Winn","from":"Donald and Sandra Winn &lt;aplan4life@...&gt;","profile":"aplan4life","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Suggestion for fun on learning about Christmas of various Religions","postDate":"1133205766","msgId":7985,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTI4MTkyMjQ3LjQ1MzY3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzMDEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7989,"prevInTime":7984,"nextInTime":7986,"topicId":7985,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We are interested in learning about how many religions celebrate winter soltice and why they do so.
