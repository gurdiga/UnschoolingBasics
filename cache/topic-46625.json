Yes, I do think it would be disrespectful if we saw our kids or our husband&#39;s stuff out in the rain and just left it there to teach them a lesson.  But here is my question.  How do we teach them that they have to pick up there stuff and not leave it out everywhere if we do it for them?  And how are they going to do as an adult unless they marry someone who is just going to do everything for them?  Like the above quote, this husband would expect his wife to do everything around the house because it is her &quot;job&quot;.  Well if we always just do everything for our kids, are they not going to grow up and think this is how their spouse is supposed to do for them, just bend over backward and do everything for them.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not wanting to start any arguments here.

Children are Wired to learn. Learning is something they do effortlessly. Rather than thinking about what they &quot;need&quot; to learn, it goes  a long way to look at the world from their point of view as much as you can, and get a sense of what they Are learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids &quot;get&quot; the idea of cause and effect - its something toddlers explore in detail so its relatively safe to assume that any child over 4 has a good handle on the idea of &quot;consequences&quot;. The consequences of making a mess is that there&#39;s a mess. One of the common consequence of mom making a biiiiig deal about a mess is that kids avoid dealing with messess - who wants to put up with all that hullaballoo? Better sneak off when she&#39;s distracted. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The more I &quot;push&quot; and have a negative tone, the more <br/>\n&gt; push back and fighting I get.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tada! That&#39;s a great example of cause and effect. Part of deschooling for parents, somewhat ironically, is re-learning what real life conseqences are. We get a fed a lot of theory about what parenting Should do, but much of that theory doesn&#39;t look at real world effects of that theory. One of the advantages of easing in to unschooling is that you get to see the real life effects of changing your behavior. The less you &quot;push&quot; the less your kids push back - hooray! <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar","from":"&quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Question about compliance","postDate":"1305048228","msgId":46653,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzQzZDRDVDOUE3RjRGOEJBN0Q5M0Q1Mzc3MEQwREE5QENvbm5pZVBDPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg5MzAzOC40MjMzOS5xbUB3ZWIzODQwMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGlxYTBkZysxMG45OUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDg5MzAzOC40MjMzOS5xbUB3ZWIzODQwMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46652,"nextInTopic":46654,"prevInTime":46652,"nextInTime":46654,"topicId":46625,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: Francine Sent: Monday, May 09, 2011 7:49 PM To: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Question about compliance ...

If you screwed up or got in trouble, then you got lots of attention. Some could see that as craving discipline when it is actually a craving for ANY kind of attention.

If all the kids knew was uninvolved, uncaring, no discipline, then it is very likely that they will thank somebody that actually takes the time to pay attention to them.

Even though I am an adult, I still have family members that try to mold me into who they want me to be. It doesn&#39;t feel good when somebody calls me and tells me that I need to get out more because my brain is rotting by staying home with my kids. I was told I need to participate more in society because I am so smart, blah, blah, blah. I was told that I should take classes or get a job or something, which totally dismisses that I DO have a job teaching an online class at a university. It totally dismisses my participation on these lists.

Why did you have kids in the first place? When I was trying to figure out unschooling, I had to answer that question first. I had kids because I LOVE them. I have always loved kids. I did not have kids out of a sense of duty to family or the world. A lot of people grow up and have kids because that is what they are supposed to do. If you have kids because that is what you are supposed to do, it can sometimes be hard to put aside all of the &quot;supposed to do&#39;s&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother related question is: Would you still feel frustrated and hurt if he was mentally or physically incapable of doing what you asked? If he was confined to wheel chair, would you still be frustrated and hurt? Would you feel like he was taking advantage of you then? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would him not doing what you asked negatively influence his friendships in the future? Are you going to go around telling his friends that he doesn&#39;t listen to his mom? I don&#39;t always listen to my friends or family. I am actually very selective about who I listen to because not everybody understands me or my priority to be a mom first. Should I listen to the people that are telling me that I need to get out more and get away from my kids? Maybe I don&#39;t value that relationship as much as the relationship that I have with my kids. All relationships are not equal. My relationship with my husband is not equal to the relationship that I have with my siblings or my children. They are all different. Whether or not I choose to listen to somebody largely depends on how much I trust that person and whether or not I think that person will stand up for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Question about compliance","postDate":"1305043975","msgId":46648,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg4ODkwNC45ODMzLnFtQHdlYjgxNTA3Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDgzOTAzOS44ODEwMS5xbUB3ZWI4NzMxNy5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGlxYTBkZysxMG45OUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDg5MzAzOC40MjMzOS5xbUB3ZWIzODQwMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDw4MzkwMzkuODgxMDEucW1Ad2ViODczMTcubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46647,"nextInTopic":46649,"prevInTime":46647,"nextInTime":46649,"topicId":46625,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Depending on what it is, I know my brother (who has dealt with older kids, mine are young yet) would do things like hang their jackets up outside or leave","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1248524982\">&quot;&quot;Depending on what it is, I know my brother (who has dealt with older kids, mine <br/>\nare young yet) would do things like hang their jackets up outside or leave them <br/>\nwere they were because they would get wet.

He&#39;s seeing a little bit of daylight - mom&#39;s backing off the control...or at least it looks like mom&#39;s backing off the control. Is it real? Is it an illusion? Is mom going to revert to controlling again?

If you can wrap your head around the idea that it&#39;s the two of you on the same &#39;side&#39; even though you each have different priorities, that will help. Consider how you would handle the situation with a partner or good friend. Would you -expect- them to stop whatever they&#39;re doing to do what you want them to do right away - or would you give them leeway to finish what they&#39;re doing and then remind them, help them, with whatever it is? Our household, adult and child alike, is a partnership predicated on the basis that we are all doing our best and we each want the best for all (all for one, one for all).

First, if brazen is saying &quot;hang on&quot; <br/>\nthen your child may go beyond your initial boundaries much more than you <br/>\nexpected. &quot;Hang on&quot; in my interpretation is simply wait a moment. No is also not <br/>\na brazen thing, it&#39;s a response to a yes or no question. If you ask a question <br/>\nyou need to be prepared for a range of answers and not simply the one that you <br/>\nare hoping for. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven your statement that he is getting quite brazen I expect that you believe <br/>\nthat respect comes from running a tight ship. And that when your son tells you <br/>\nto wait a minute or not right now or no, even, that he is undermining your <br/>\nauthority and no longer respecting you. I think if respecting your authority is <br/>\nthe goal of your parenting unschooling is unlikely to be an easy approach for <br/>\nyou. However if you can see that his feeling more comfortable with telling you <br/>\nnot right now, wait a minute, or no, even, is a part of him seeing you as a <br/>\nperson who respects him. Not his authority, but who he is and how he is <br/>\nexploring the world. I think his respect for you is more likely to grow in an <br/>\nenvironment where he is being respected than one where he is expected to respect <br/>\nyour authority. If he comes to respect you for you that will last a good deal <br/>\nlonger than a disciplined respect for you authority ever would. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, he was doing a really cool thing. He was doing a study in physics and <br/>\nmaterial science and teamwork. It was a totally applied science moment. Which <br/>\nyou describe almost dismissively: &quot;When I went outside I found the street full <br/>\nof tomato skins, tools, scraps of cardboard, all kinds of evidence of their good <br/>\ntime.&quot; Two boys were working in concert to solve a problem and you wrote it off <br/>\nas them just playing around. You also took the shine off of your appreciation by <br/>\nwatching their idea and admonishing them to clean up: &quot;after I watched their <br/>\nsuccess and reminded him to clean up when done.&quot; If you diminished his feelings <br/>\nof pleasure over what he and his friend did by calling him home to clean up what <br/>\nyou said would only take two minutes to clean, it may make it less likely that <br/>\nhe is willing to try his hand at similar experiments. By raining on his parade, <br/>\nby taking that joyful eureka moment that he and his friend were celebrating and <br/>\nmaking it about cleaning up tomato skins and cardboard you may have dampened his <br/>\nwillingness to jump into something that may make a mess. Messes shouldn&#39;t be the <br/>\ncriteria which someone uses to decide what they want to do for the day or the <br/>\nmoment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: odiniella &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hgaimari@...\">hgaimari@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 10 May, 2011 1:21:04<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Question about compliance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSince putting away our school curricula, our home has really changed<br/>\nnicely, but yesterday my ds (11) made a comment that has become a bit<br/>\nmore common than I&#39;m comfortable with and I&#39;d like very much to be able<br/>\nto fend off any trouble before it starts.   I&#39;m finding myself<br/>\nnegotiating with my son more and more these days.  I&#39;m trying to stop<br/>\nand really think about the requests/demands I&#39;m expecting, but my<br/>\nconcern is this habit of putting off what needs to be done with apparent<br/>\ndisregard for respecting others.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s conscious, I think<br/>\nhe&#39;s just living in the moment.  However, I&#39;ve seen this attitude take<br/>\non a bit more courage now that I&#39;m not taking on the position of<br/>\ncontrolling his time by making him do things like school work and house<br/>\nchores.   He&#39;s getting quite brazen about telling me no or &quot;hang on&quot;<br/>\n(which is his nice way of saying &quot;no&quot;).  A recent example:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  He and a friend were testing designs for an upcoming egg drop contest<br/>\nat the local homeschool science fair this week.  They used some tomatoes<br/>\nI gave them for the project.  Being soft and vulnerable, they thought<br/>\nthat was a great idea and had lots of fun testing different ideas.  They<br/>\nfound one they think will work well, and ran off the park to play after<br/>\nI watched their success and reminded him to clean up when done.  When I<br/>\nwent outside I found the street full of tomato skins, tools, scraps of<br/>\ncardboard, all kinds of evidence of their good time.  I called ds to ask<br/>\nhim to please come home and clean it and he refused.  Just refused.  He<br/>\nexplained he was having fun with his friend and I reminded him this<br/>\nwould take less than two minutes and he could go back to the park, but<br/>\nit was totally uncool to leave the neighborhood looking like this.  He<br/>\ndid come back but immediately started arguing with me.  I can understand<br/>\nhe wants to know why, although we&#39;ll have to talk about arguing in<br/>\ngeneral and how that&#39;s going to backfire with friends and future<br/>\nemployers, etc.   It&#39;s not a matter of forgetting (I&#39;m like that too, I<br/>\nknow how that works), it&#39;s a matter of refusing when it&#39;s pointed out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

If there was a tomato mess in the street, how important is cleaning it up immediately? If you live in a nice neighborhood where there are expectations on how things should be kept, then I would probably clean it up immediately without saying anything to anybody. In my neighborhood where there are no real expectations because it is semi-rural, I might pick up the tools but leave the tomatoes for the birds and other wild animals. If I am in a position to take care of something for my kids, I try to do it. If I am busy, then I try to assume that my child is also busy and that one or both of us will get to it as soon as possible. I have found it helpful to not focus on WHO made the mess. I try to notice that there is a mess and do something about it because I am just as prone to making messes as my children are. I don’t want them to get the idea that you only have to clean up the messes that you make. I like to focus on the idea that a mess is a mess no matter who made it.

They used some tomatoes<br/>\nI gave them for the project.  Being soft and vulnerable, they thought<br/>\nthat was a great idea and had lots of fun testing different ideas.  They<br/>\nfound one they think will work well, and ran off the park to play after<br/>\nI watched their success and reminded him to clean up when done.  When I<br/>\nwent outside I found the street full of tomato skins, tools, scraps of<br/>\ncardboard, all kinds of evidence of their good time.  I called ds to ask<br/>\nhim to please come home and clean it and he refused.  Just refused.  He<br/>\nexplained he was having fun with his friend and I reminded him this<br/>\nwould take less than two minutes and he could go back to the park, but<br/>\nit was totally uncool to leave the neighborhood looking like this.  He<br/>\ndid come back but immediately started arguing with me.
