She was wearing a t-shirt with the name of a band on it that<br/>\nwas ______ Butterfly.  It was not Iron Butterfly (I would have<br/>\nrecognized that one) nor was it Butterfly Effect (ditto).  We chatted<br/>\nfor a minute.  I asked her about the band and she said those ill-fated<br/>\nwords, &quot;You&#39;re too old to understand this kind of music.&quot;  I SO wanted<br/>\nto say, &quot;Sweetie I was going to grunge and punk underground concerts<br/>\nbefore your mama was out of diapers!&quot;  Instead I said, &quot;Try me.   What<br/>\nkind of music do they play?&quot;  She hemmed and hawed and so I said, &quot;Is<br/>\nit interstitial?&quot;  (Total blank stare)  &quot;Punk?&quot;  &quot;Not really&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Grunge?&quot;  &quot;No not that either.&quot;  &quot;Heavy metal?&quot;  &quot;No&quot;  &quot;Techno?<br/>\nAcid?  Head banging?  Pop?  Garage?&quot;  &quot;No. No. No. No. No.  It&#39;s hard<br/>\nto define.&quot; &quot;Oh, so interstitial.&quot;  (another blank stare.)   So I told<br/>\nher that I would look them up and hear what they had.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, now I am home and in front of the computer and can&#39;t remember<br/>\nthe first part of the name.  The logo was a butterfly with the name of<br/>\nthe band over the it and red &quot;splattery blood/paint&quot; across it.  Does<br/>\nthis ring a bell with anyone?  I figured this would be a good group to<br/>\nask as we have children that are all over the spectrum as far as music<br/>\ntastes go.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle - who refuses to adopt the label &quot;old foagy&quot;  :-D</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16803,"nextTopicId":17542}}
