(At home, my husband reads news and email and articles and listens to music; my son is an avid gamer.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly, my daughter wasn&#39;t so into computers when she was 11. But my son was. And my husband and I were. So - here we are, an unschooling family of computer geeks, and no harm done by it, and plenty of good, in terms of learning and hire-ability, in addition to entertainment. <br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, when my kids were younger, we also always loved swimming, going to parks and museums, concerts and plays, and other places of interest, reading aloud together, and other activities. My daughter has always been into art and crafts such as jewelry-making and sculpting. My kids liked to ride their bikes when they were younger; my son went roller-skating once a week; they got together with friends as often as possible. During the school year, they took some classes with our homeschool group. They each joined a Venture Scout group when they turned 14, and went to weekly meetings and did occasional cool stuff on weekends, like sailing, hiking, camping, rock-climbing, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we have always done a variety of activities, but we all spent and still spend a LOT of time online.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are obvious advantages to being highly computer-literate and tech-savvy. And kids who spend a lot of time online really DO learn a lot! ALL of the kids I know whose parents let them spend a lot of time online are interesting, well-informed people who are knowledgeable and enthusiastic about a wide range of topics. <br/>\n<br/>\n(Addressing concerns that people who spend a lot of time in front of electronic screens are unhealthy because of it: Neither of my kids is overweight or out-of-shape. At this point, my daughter gets her exercise by walking the dog, and doing pool maintenance and cleaning as a part of her job; I&#39;m not sure what my son does for exercise these days; he lives about 40 miles away, and I don&#39;t get to see him very often. But I know he&#39;s healthy and happy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - what does your husband see as the disadvantages of your daughter&#39;s spending so much time online? Whatever disadvantages he sees, can you all sit down and discuss his concerns rationally, without getting angry and upset? <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes he recognize the advantages of being comfortable and skilled with computers, and the availability of limitless information and culture and exposure to the wider world on the internet? (Surely your daughter wonders about things sometimes  has questions, like any kid does  and with the computer right in front of her, she can get the answers right away! In the middle of my writing this, my daughter asked something about the history of domesticated chickens, and that led to my husband and daughter and I all looking up articles about chickens  and then doves and pigeons. We did a whole &quot;research project&quot; since I started writing this message!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there other things your daughter likes doing that she would be willing (and happy) spending *some* of her time on, that would make your husband feel better about how she&#39;s spending her days? Does she like to swim, or ride a bike, or walk (maybe even walk around a mall with friends)? Does she enjoy reading books (in addition to emails, FB comments, and information about musicians and movies, etc) at all, or listening to audio books? Does she have a pet to take care of? (My daughter has a chinchilla that she has taken care of since she was 11.) Does she enjoy doing anything artistic or musical? Gardening? Sewing or knitting? Does she have friends?<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully you&#39;ll be able to reassure your husband about the very real advantages of spending time online, AND come up with some other enjoyable (and maybe productive) ways for your daughter to spend some of her time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it helps him feel better about the situation, you can let him know that a lot of grown unschoolers who spent a lot of time online as kids are now working in IT, programming, web design, graphic design, journalism, etc. If he wants examples, I&#39;ll write more about the ones I know, and know of.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, T McAdams &lt;tmcadams81670@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello all,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My daughter is 11.5 and she spends most of her day online.

I see, when looking it up, that it is subtitled &quot;Saving our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder&quot;, goodness a whole disorder. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read Wisconsin Death Trip? It was turned into a film that you can watch on youtube: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCEhxUZuV98&feature=related.\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCEhxUZuV98&feature=related.</a> It was a series of clippings and photographs from Wisconsin in the late 1800&#39;s about life and madness and death in Wisconsin. I don&#39;t like the narrator&#39;s whisper on the film. My mom has the book and it fascinated me, this analysis of what it was to live in nature. I like civilisation. David is reading Mari Sandoz&#39;s book Old Jules right now, another account of how nature red in tooth and claw is not the kindest of developers. It&#39;s her biography of her father, as he requested she write it, who was not a gentle man. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is an interesting disorder to bring up on a list where children are being encouraged to explore the world on their own terms. I presume the prescription would be some kind of forced engagement with nature? My children are big into computers and gaming. Internet access is important, and the past 3 weeks without much access has been frustrating, for me at least as much as for them. It is a big part of how they connect with the world and how the world connects with them. And you can change the pronoun in the last sentence from &quot;they&quot; and &quot;them&quot; to &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;. It is a fabulous thing that I can respond from anywhere in the world, given access, to someone anywhere else in the world. It is a fabulous thing that I can watch someone doing makeup for horror films without having to sign up for a class or figure out a way to get to Hollywood or make it up as I go along or decide that it isn&#39;t worth the effort, the curiosity all because youtube brings it to me,<br/>\n brings me specialists in the field. Incredible. I know how, at least theoretically, to make up a burn injury on someone, 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree, because Simon and Linnaea shared a video with me last night. And I know more clearly what those degrees are because of the video. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving those things to hand, however, hasn&#39;t precluded walks on the beach, or feeding kookaburras, or listening to magpies self-harmonising--almost like throat singers, or testing natural insect repellents on lines of ants or finding chitons on a rock amongst other molluscs or enjoying kangaroos and joeys or going to used bookstores or any of it. If I forced them, they wouldn&#39;t come so quickly, so readily when I called to look at this. They wouldn&#39;t find pleasure in nature, only duty. Nature deficit disorder sounds a justification for making a child do what you want them to do. Just like all the other kinds of excuses that populate the world of parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/gCEhxUZuV98?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]},{"userId":334892198,"authorName":"Ann","from":"&quot;Ann&quot; &lt;auntannies2002@...&gt;","profile":"auntannies2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Questions about computer usage","postDate":"1340051444","msgId":48634,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpybzM1bCs2c2w0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDRjFBQ0M2MzdEM0IwQi1ENzQtQjFGMkB3ZWJtYWlsLWQxODMuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":48629,"nextInTopic":48636,"prevInTime":48633,"nextInTime":48635,"topicId":48613,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I agree.

I put it back at them ... what do you think they should be learning about? After sometimes they came up with a very generic list: math, history, etc... and we filled in under each of these subjects the things that my children do daily to meet these needs. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have plenty of their own time online but we also use math games online and I give research assignments for them to do online all the time, usually pertaining to something that they are interested in ... as you said research on music artists, etc... but I feel (and maybe you do this) that the next step is for you (or an adult) to have conversations around this information ... my kids and I even sometimes use a yahoo group to have conversations but mostly in the car or at the dinner table ... we talk about a song they like, the artist, where the artist is from, how they became famous, and this usually branches to many things. When ever my children have a question we research it ... find out the history, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is hard for others to see because it is not the typical ... but it is a way of learning. Again for me a big issue is that all these things need to be done with guidance from someone ... hope this helps some!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nWith peace, love and kindness, <br/>\nAmy Lemmon<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:amylemmon@...\">amylemmon@...</a><br/>\nBlog: Six Flower Mom<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: T McAdams &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tmcadams81670@...\">tmcadams81670@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 17, 2012 9:56 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Questions about computer usage<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nHello all,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is 11.5 and she spends most of her day online.
