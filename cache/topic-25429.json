If you<br/>\nget a minute, go google &quot;Advice to Myself&quot; by Louise Erdrich. It&#39;s a<br/>\nreally great poem I&#39;ve been focused on lately. Inspirational stuff that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake the housework a time to play with the kids! Truly.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t learn this as a child, so it&#39;s a bit counterintuitive for me.<br/>\nBut many unschoolers helped me learn that housework isn&#39;t drudgery. It<br/>\nisn&#39;t &quot;boring&quot;. It CAN be a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nCiara and I will literally POUR water on the floor. We slop around in<br/>\nit with rags on our feet. It feels really cool to swish around the<br/>\nfloor in soapy water...kinda like Pippi Longstocking.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we take small towels and start pushing those around with our feet<br/>\nto dry it all up. It&#39;s a big, laughing game and the floor really does<br/>\nget clean!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not always great at making it a game. But at least I don&#39;t nag<br/>\nthem. Once in a while I DO hit a point where I&#39;m like &quot;I can&#39;t take<br/>\nthis nasty mess anymore you guys!! HELP me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI hit that point last night, when every floor felt like a layer of<br/>\nsoda was on it! I had a moment of &quot;this house is so disgusting I can&#39;t<br/>\nSTAND it&quot;. This morning, I got up and mopped and did some housework<br/>\nbefore anyone was awake and miraculously I&#39;m feeling better.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend is coming over to help me get organized and clean tomorrow.<br/>\nCool. The kids will undoubtedly help out too....it&#39;s in their nature<br/>\nto be involved in whatever looks interesting at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as dropping the housework to play....yeah, I think that&#39;s<br/>\nreally great.

As <br/>\nsomeone who would not probably be considered an unschooler as yet (I <br/>\nhave been home edding for six years, mostly unstructured approach), <br/>\nI still find myself torn between housework and playing with the <br/>\nkids. I really like the idea of getting involved with the kids&#39; <br/>\ngames and although the kids willingly help with chores, etc. I <br/>\nwonder what your advice would be for getting into a good space to <br/>\nparticipate regularly in the kids&#39; games. I get so distracted time-<br/>\nwise as it is and often my hubbie says I am unorganised and don&#39;t <br/>\nprioritise with tasks. I say this not to bag him, or to elicit <br/>\na &#39;you poor downtrodden wife&#39;, response but to give you an idea of <br/>\nmy personality and issues. I am quite a divergent thinker, but I do <br/>\ntry and value order too, lol. I am pretty good at silly, dinosaur <br/>\nvs. action man scenarios, but find it hard when my 7 year old wants <br/>\nto play, as she often has a full script in her mind, even for my <br/>\ncharacter. I find it hard not to tune out when being told &quot;now you <br/>\nhave to be the brown foal and you say....&quot;, etc. I hope all of the <br/>\nmore experienced unschoolers won&#39;t mind me asking what is probably a <br/>\nbasic question, but go ahead and have a chuckle at me - I&#39;m smiling <br/>\nas I write, so why not? Does it come naturally to you all to play, <br/>\nor do you get bored? I am really keen to explore this, as I know <br/>\nplay is a good way to connect with your child on their level.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanking you in advance for your thoughts,<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":248268539,"authorName":"MystikMomma@frontiernet.net","from":"&quot;MystikMomma@...&quot; &lt;MystikMomma@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Unschooling and &quot;No&quot;","postDate":"1186020782","msgId":25429,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyYmMwMWM3ZDRhYSRhN2VjMDQ2MCQwN2ZlYThjMEBzcXVpZD4=","referencesHeader":"PGY4cXZkYitiNzYxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25511,"prevInTime":25428,"nextInTime":25430,"topicId":25429,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I say let him go naked in the mud, put a bucket/hose by the door to the house, and most importantly, BE there with him while he plays!!
