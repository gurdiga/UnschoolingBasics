Jayn was very little at the time, and not being the big creator that<br/>\nshe is now. I was just letting things go some, feeling a little overwhelmed<br/>\nand resentful - alone in the task. I hadn&#39;t learnt to ask for help very well<br/>\nyet. Dh was getting snappier and grumpier. And there were some arguments,<br/>\nwhere I was baffled at the intensity of his emotions. I mean he is the<br/>\nperson who would step over the doll five times, and then explode about mess<br/>\nand make it my responsibility, rather than just pick up the doll the first<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt finally came out, with many tears on both our parts, that he was afraid I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t love him anymore and was planning to leave him, because I wasn&#39;t<br/>\ntaking care of &quot;his home&quot;. He truly saw (sees) the housework I do as a gift<br/>\nof love to him. It had never occurred to me to see it that way, just as I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it occurred to him to have to express that idea, and his<br/>\ngratitude, to me. He just tried to &quot;force&quot; my love back by demanding I clean<br/>\nup. Since from my perspective my love hadn&#39;t gone away I just got hurt and<br/>\nangry. <br/>\n<br/>\nThings have been way better since. He is more relaxed, or at least acceptant<br/>\nof the times when the house gets out of hand. I try harder to stay on top of<br/>\nthings and am much more successful at asking for help, including regular<br/>\npurges of accumulated clutter - my stuff only, sometimes his. Jayn is a<br/>\nhoarder at the moment. He is also more grateful, and I do all I can to<br/>\nexpress love and reassurance to him in other ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I <br/>\nhave a clarification question.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve known stepson for almost 5 years now.  Because he&#39;s getting older I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen stuck about how to get some help with chores around the house.  I can&#39;t do <br/>\nit all myself and DH is a neat freak.  He tries to understand that my <br/>\nfull-time job is being mama/stepmama to our DS and his DS (who is with us half time) <br/>\nbut he has trouble with the house being so messy (that doesn&#39;t mean he won&#39;t <br/>\npick up himself if it bothers him that much - he does do that).  We&#39;ve done <br/>\nfamily meetings which has helped a lot.  Stepson really enjoys being an equal <br/>\nparticipant in the meetings.  That has been one way for me to get some help.  Let <br/>\neveryone know what my needs are and ask what everyone is willing to do to <br/>\nassist me in getting those needs me.  No coercion needed.  Everyone has been very <br/>\nwilling to participate and help out - in theory.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBefore DH and I started considering Unschooling we had a rule that when <br/>\nstepson finished playing with something he would need to pick it up before he moved <br/>\non to something else.  We helped if he needed it and it was never a battle.  <br/>\nNow we don&#39;t have &quot;rules&quot; like that.  But I&#39;ve been wondering how other <br/>\nfamilies make the chore thing work.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not complicated for those of you <br/>\ndoing it the respectful way and feeling like you *know* that way and are <br/>\ncomfortable with it.  I&#39;ve been struggling with this - how to I get things done <br/>\nwithout any help.  It&#39;s just not possible.  So let me see if I have this right.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not a problem to ask for help.  I just can&#39;t expect everyone to jump up <br/>\nimmediately and do it NOW because I wouldn&#39;t want to be treated that way.  As <br/>\nlong as they have an &quot;I&#39;m busy right now&quot; out (or something like that), then <br/>\nit&#39;s fine to ask.  Is that the way you all do it?  As I said, we&#39;ve done the <br/>\nfamily meeting and it works pretty well, but I can&#39;t expect a Kindergartner to <br/>\nremember everything he said he wanted to help with by mid-week.
