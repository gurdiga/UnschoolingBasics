My youngest two could never make decisions!  This was hard <br/>\nbecause I had three older kids who never had a problem with <br/>\ndecisions.  The way I handled it was to break down each choice for <br/>\nthem so the decision contained less choices.  If we went to <br/>\nMcDonalds, for example, I knew they wanted fries and a drink, so the <br/>\nbig choice was what meat they wanted.  I would ask, &quot;do you want <br/>\nchicken, hamburg or fish?&quot;.  Then it was, &quot;do you want the sandwich <br/>\nor in nugget form&quot;, then &quot;do you want soda or a milk shake&quot;.  It was <br/>\nharder in a candy store, though, because there were more choices.  <br/>\nThe funniest thing was about a month ago, I mentioned this to my <br/>\ndaughter and she said she thought I asked like that because I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t make a decision--lol. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would think that the way you could break your son&#39;s choice of two <br/>\ntoys down would be to talk about the different features.

In <br/>\nfact, my dh just sat here in the kitchen trying to decide what CD to buy and <br/>\nwhere to buy it.  It took over an hour to decide between 2 CD&#39;s and 2 stores.  <br/>\n(Various Artists type CD with one particular song on he wanted).  I&#39;d have been <br/>\nthere and back by now.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, after &quot;deciding&quot; he left and came back 25 minutes later empty <br/>\nhanded.  Couldn&#39;t decide after he got there, got himself in a funk about it, so just <br/>\nleft and is now upstairs trying to forget about it in front of the TV, I <br/>\nimagine.<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately, it seems to have skipped a generation in my children because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think there is anything you can honestly do.  These guys seemed to be <br/>\nwired this way and after nearly 20 years I have not figured out a way around <br/>\nthis.  For a little guy, I might ask if he&#39;d rather me decide for him, since it is <br/>\nsooooo very hard.  It might take some of the pressure off him if he said yes! <br/>\n Just a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I can commiserate - it is absolutely painful having to witness this <br/>\nindecision.  And to Pam - it could be any and all of those things you mention.  I <br/>\nthink mostly it is fear of making the wrong decision, so they just don&#39;t make <br/>\nany.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] on to my next delima.....","postDate":"1086984595","msgId":618,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRFNjgzNzU1LUJCRTMtMTFEOC1CNzU2LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE1NC4zNzU4MjIyMi4yZGZiNGYyZEBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE1NC4zNzU4MjIyMi4yZGZiNGYyZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":605,"nextInTopic":627,"prevInTime":617,"nextInTime":619,"topicId":605,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
