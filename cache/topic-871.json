The ability to<br/>\ntake classes as they fit their lifestyle and needs,<br/>\nand equally the ability to leave just as easily if it<br/>\nstops meeting their needs.

It&#39;s real life, it&#39;s learning and it&#39;s exploring the world.<br/>\nA Unit, is when the teacher or student picks a topic, and then comes up with lessons in all subjects, centered around that topic.<br/>\nUnschoolers don&#39;t need to turn things into lessons.<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean our children won&#39;t pursue some very academic or schoolish looking subjects....or even pour themselves into studying something intensely.  But as parents, I don&#39;t think we are de-schooled, if we think that an interest means we come up with lessons or workbooks as our first reaction to the interest.<br/>\nExploring an interest around here does not involve lessons of any kind, it means learning about the interest in a variety of methods, all involving real life use. That doesn&#39;t mean the child won&#39;t want formal studies in the topic eventually, but that certainly isn&#39;t our job as unschooling parents-to find lessons based on interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, Trevor became very interested in computers last year. My reaction? To help him find a mentor that he could hang out with, work with, learn from in order to get started. I brought up the idea to him, and he was thrilled. We found an unschooling Dad/computer whiz that was equally excited to work with an interested teen.<br/>\nHe helped Trevor get a bunch of computer parts to muck about with, gave him some books and was available when questions arose. Trevor has built his own computer and continues to learn and be excited about his interest. No lessons. No one telling him what to learn or what to do....just being available and making reccomendations based on his experience.<br/>\nVery cool situation. Eventually, Trevor may take some formal classes. He talks about getting some kind of degree in computer technology...he has plans to create the next BIG anti-virus software. In the mean time, he&#39;s a 14 y.o. kid, having fun with what he loves and playing a LOT of video games.:) I don&#39;t feel the need to create &quot;units&quot; or studies or lessons of any kind based on their passions.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think until a person let&#39;s go of that idea, will unschooling be as bubbly and swirly and wonderful as it possibly could be....<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":849,"nextTopicId":860}}
