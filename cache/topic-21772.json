Although I could go on for days about being new to<br/>\nunschooling and past/present problems my son and I<br/>\nhave; I&#39;ll stick to a question at hand right now. My<br/>\nson (12) has been home from public school for 2 years<br/>\nnow. Although we have tried many different approaches<br/>\nto homeschooling, nothing is seeming to work out.<br/>\nFinally I threw my hands up and decided to lay off all<br/>\n&quot;schoolwork&quot;. I have been TRYING to be more mindful<br/>\nand less controling, but this doesn&#39;t always work-my<br/>\nhangups obviously. SO, he said to me the other day<br/>\nthat he thinks we should &quot;get on the ball soon&quot; and<br/>\nstart doing schoolwork again because he would like to<br/>\ngo to high school. Ugh. So I complied and gave him 2<br/>\nSMALL worksheets to do (easy math and grammar-more<br/>\nreview than anything) the next week. He avoided them<br/>\nlike the plague and only did them because we were<br/>\ngetting ready to leave for the day. So, how should I<br/>\ngo about preparing my son for high school in 2 years<br/>\nif he says he wants to &quot;get ready&quot; but doesn&#39;t? I have<br/>\ntried to do real life learning of some things-but as<br/>\nsoon as he thinks I am &quot;teaching&quot; him something, he<br/>\nshows no interest. I just feel like a even comparison<br/>\nwould be saying that my 5 year old daughter was going<br/>\nto start school-at the 4th grade level. How could she<br/>\npossibly be ready to do 4th grade work if she can&#39;t<br/>\neven read. I know I probably sound like I&#39;m going over<br/>\nthe edge-but I am new to everything right now. I have<br/>\nchecked out Sandra Dodd&#39;s site and a few others. Sorry<br/>\nthis post is so long. :-)  Heather L.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNeed a quick answer?
