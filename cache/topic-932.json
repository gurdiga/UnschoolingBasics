You have<br/>\nmotivated me to do something I have thought about but never followed through<br/>\nwith.  My fil owns a manufacturing plant.  They make musical instruments.  I<br/>\nhave never taken a tour there.  I have had relatives who did and my best<br/>\nfriends family did on a recent trip but neither I nor my four year old have.<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny because Mark is the tour guide.  Anyway, I am going to schedule a<br/>\ntour in the near future.  Thanks again.  It was fun looking at the website<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\nKay</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":931,"nextTopicId":998}}
