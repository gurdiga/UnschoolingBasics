My valiant attempts at <br/>\nteaching my two children packaged curriculum, or the hodge podge <br/>\nknown as &quot;The Classical Method&quot; always left me giving up halfway <br/>\nthrough and just letting the kids be kids. I have a natually curious <br/>\ndaughter who was constantly checking books out from the library <br/>\nabout what she wanted to learn anyway (now that my son is older he <br/>\ndoes the same). But I didn&#39;t officially start unscooling until this <br/>\nyear. Not because of the great books I read (there were many, John <br/>\nHolt & David Albert among them ), not because of the wonderful <br/>\nwebsites and testimonials (although they were informative and <br/>\ninspiring). The low down dirty truth is that my mother died. A <br/>\nhorrible, unexpected death, and two years later I am still reeling <br/>\nfrom it. Although I got into counseling right away, it wasn&#39;t until <br/>\nthis year that her death really hit home. I found that I needed to <br/>\nstop the whirlwind of my life and just BE. So we stopped &quot;doing <br/>\nschool&quot;. We started just living. I started sleeping in and letting <br/>\nthe kids get up and do whatever they wanted. Sometimes that was <br/>\nplaying a video game, sometimes it meant they made cookies for <br/>\nbreakfast (with me on call to take the cookie sheet out of the <br/>\noven), or played mancala or played zoo with all their stuffed <br/>\nanimals. We played cards together, took walks, watched movies, had <br/>\ntea. I asked for time alone when I needed it. At first I felt <br/>\nguilty, was I being neglectful? We weren&#39;t doing our Saxon math! Was <br/>\nit ok to have them downstairs making toast (at ages 11 & 6 ) while I <br/>\nslept til 7:30 or 8? I was so used to being &quot;super mom&quot;, the <br/>\nattached parent. Now my daughter is getting nervous about this new <br/>\nunschooling thing. &quot;Will I learn what I need to know?&quot; she&#39;ll <br/>\nask. &quot;Honey you can learn whatever you want, and that will be what <br/>\nyou need to know&quot; is what I&#39;ve been replying. So we go to the <br/>\nlibrary, we go to the park, we watch Bill Nye the Science guy. On my <br/>\ndown days I hope it will be enough. It is enough for me that I have <br/>\nhappy, healthy children. And truth be told, I need this unschooling <br/>\nas much as they do. And so I ramble here on this post. For <br/>\nreassurance, for support, for companionship; and just to say hello.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening,<br/>\n<br/>\nSara :-)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17440,"nextTopicId":17441}}
