We always take our old crusts of<br/>\nbread to feel the seagulls. As we started one woman said &quot;don&#39;t feed those<br/>\nscavengers! They are awful!&quot; I said, &quot;they are birds and we are just feeding<br/>\nthem.&quot; Well she argued with me that they weren&#39;t birds they were scavengers<br/>\nand worse than a plague on the earth. I just kept saying, &quot;they are birds<br/>\nlady, whether you like them or not doesn&#39;t change what they are.&quot; My dd was<br/>\nvery disturbed at the names this lady was calling them. We stopped feeding<br/>\nand moved to another spot that wouldn&#39;t disturb her. So I told my dd that<br/>\nthis woman was wrong and ignorant (I have no problems telling my dd that<br/>\nabout some people) BUT that it was the right thing for us to be considerate<br/>\nand move to another area, since it was a public area.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that is how I would deal with it if it arises again in a public place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is different in that it is his land, not yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou perceived that he cut the tree down thoughtlessly, but it is his tree to<br/>\ncut down and I would politely suggest that perhaps he felt your daughter was<br/>\nout of line trying to tell him what to do with his trees on his property,<br/>\njust as you think he was out of line to argue with your beliefs about trees<br/>\ntalking or not. Do you see what I mean? I think perhaps both parties stepped<br/>\non each others toes a bit, but it doesn&#39;t have to be the end of it all. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are, of course welcome to your beliefs, and to tell him that he hurt<br/>\nthat tree and trying to get him to believe that they do talk when that isn&#39;t<br/>\nhis belief, is no more respectful than him trying to insist that they don&#39;t<br/>\ntalk.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if it was me, I would have told my daughter that I agreed with her grief<br/>\nfor the tree, perhaps suggested a ceremony to remember it by and possibly<br/>\nfind some use for the wood (if he didn&#39;t use it) to make sure it wasn&#39;t in<br/>\nvain, but I would be sure she knew that this was his land and he could do<br/>\nwhat he wanted on it and that he didn&#39;t share our beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the fact that you call them &quot;citiots&quot; is a very disrespectful<br/>\nmessage to send your daughter as well to be honest.

The are what we commonly <br/>\n  call &quot;citiots&quot; (idiots from the city).  They have no common sense or <br/>\n  courtisy for living in the country.  We teach our children to respect <br/>\n  nature and the earth around up.  We are studing native american <br/>\n  culture and are trying to &quot;teach by example&quot; how to respect the world <br/>\n  we are in.  They know that nature talks if we listen.  So, when one <br/>\n  of these landowners cut down a tree thoughtlessly, our 6 yr old dd <br/>\n  got upset and she told them that they hurt that tree.  She also went <br/>\n  on to tell them that trees have feelings too and can talk.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, dd and I were sitting looking at a letters book-(this was <br/>\n  something *she* brought to me and wanted to do)- yesterday and the <br/>\n  landowners dropped in to let us know that they were leaving.  Then <br/>\n  proceeded to make a point of telling dd in front of me in a <br/>\n  condensending way (trying to undermine me and discredit my teachings) <br/>\n  taht &quot;trees do not talk&quot;.  I told him that they most certainly do if <br/>\n  you listen.  They don&#39;t speak our language, but they do speak.  He <br/>\n  then counters &quot;they make noise when the wind blows through them, but <br/>\n  they DON&#39;T TALK&quot;.  He made this point one last time before walking <br/>\n  away.  I leaned over and whispered into dd&#39;s ear (not a good choice <br/>\n  here-but I was ticked) &quot;he&#39;s stupid, but we won&#39;t tell him that&quot;.  DD <br/>\n  just laughed and giggled about it.  It didn&#39;t seem to phase her much <br/>\n  with what he was saying, but it really made me mad that he felt he <br/>\n  had the right to push *his* opinion on my family.  What he did was no <br/>\n  different than telling a Christian family&#39;s children that Jesus <br/>\n  doesn&#39;t exsist.  (Not to bring up religion-it is just a reference.) <br/>\n  It was wrong-totally wrong.  Not to mention none of his business.  He <br/>\n  had no right to question what I teach my children, not to mention the <br/>\n  fact that he has no right undermining my teaching, my parenting, or <br/>\n  anything else in my life.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I stood my ground on our beliefs in front of my dd.  She saw that I <br/>\n  didn&#39;t waiver at all.  I even stayed polite (what a task that was!) <br/>\n  and answered him in simple terms.  My only concern now is what he <br/>\n  will try and do next time he is around.  I don&#39;t want my kids alone <br/>\n  with him at all (which is challenging since we share a yard when they <br/>\n  are here).  I am even considering, because of his disrespect for our <br/>\n  family, to not allow him in our house unless it is to repair <br/>\n  something.  No more sitting down to visit and chat.  I think he <br/>\n  stepped over the line with this and I just don&#39;t want him here <br/>\n  undermining us and being disrespectful to our family.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, what would you have done and how would you have handled this? <br/>\n<br/>\n  ~Amanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

He <br/>\nfeels only &quot;his&quot; way of thinking is right, no matter how wrong it <br/>\nis.  He has always been this way and I either avoid him or just blow <br/>\noff what he says because of it.  This whole family owns the land and <br/>\nhe is the nephew of the owners in the corporation.  This land is very <br/>\nsecluded and beautiful and we usually don&#39;t have to see the owners or <br/>\nany of the family that much--just hunting season.  Back in February <br/>\nthe president of the corp died and he was who we always worked with.  <br/>\nHis sister took over his position and she is a sweet lady, but she <br/>\nlives in Texas and that leaves the nephews near by thinking they can <br/>\ndo what ever the wish (not having to follow the rules of the corp) <br/>\nand it is getting difficult to deal with.  This fellow already had <br/>\nissues with the fact that he had no say in anything before and now is <br/>\ntrying to be &quot;big boss&quot; which he is not.  His Aunt has knocked him <br/>\ndown a few pegs already a couple of times in the last few months.  <br/>\nHe has big control issue and this latest thing is him trying to push <br/>\nhis control off on my family.  Sad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are right in the sense that he does feel his actions questioned, <br/>\nbut geeze, he was challenged by a 6 yr old????  What does that say <br/>\nabout him.  lol!

The are what we commonly <br/>\ncall &quot;citiots&quot; (idiots from the city).  They have no common sense or <br/>\ncourtisy for living in the country.  We teach our children to respect <br/>\nnature and the earth around up.  We are studing native american <br/>\nculture and are trying to &quot;teach by example&quot; how to respect the world <br/>\nwe are in.  They know that nature talks if we listen.  So, when one <br/>\nof these landowners cut down a tree thoughtlessly, our 6 yr old dd <br/>\ngot upset and she told them that they hurt that tree.  She also went <br/>\non to tell them that trees have feelings too and can talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, dd and I were sitting looking at a letters book-(this was <br/>\nsomething *she* brought to me and wanted to do)- yesterday and the <br/>\nlandowners dropped in to let us know that they were leaving.  Then <br/>\nproceeded to make a point of telling dd in front of me in a <br/>\ncondensending way (trying to undermine me and discredit my teachings) <br/>\ntaht &quot;trees do not talk&quot;.  I told him that they most certainly do if <br/>\nyou listen.  They don&#39;t speak our language, but they do speak.  He <br/>\nthen counters &quot;they make noise when the wind blows through them, but <br/>\nthey DON&#39;T TALK&quot;.  He made this point one last time before walking <br/>\naway.  I leaned over and whispered into dd&#39;s ear (not a good choice <br/>\nhere-but I was ticked) &quot;he&#39;s stupid, but we won&#39;t tell him that&quot;.  DD <br/>\njust laughed and giggled about it.  It didn&#39;t seem to phase her much <br/>\nwith what he was saying, but it really made me mad that he felt he <br/>\nhad the right to push *his* opinion on my family.  What he did was no <br/>\ndifferent than telling a Christian family&#39;s children that Jesus <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t exsist.  (Not to bring up religion-it is just a reference.) <br/>\nIt was wrong-totally wrong.  Not to mention none of his business.  He <br/>\nhad no right to question what I teach my children, not to mention the <br/>\nfact that he has no right undermining my teaching, my parenting, or <br/>\nanything else in my life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI stood my ground on our beliefs in front of my dd.  She saw that I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t waiver at all.  I even stayed polite (what a task that was!) <br/>\nand answered him in simple terms.  My only concern now is what he <br/>\nwill try and do next time he is around.  I don&#39;t want my kids alone <br/>\nwith him at all (which is challenging since we share a yard when they <br/>\nare here).  I am even considering, because of his disrespect for our <br/>\nfamily, to not allow him in our house unless it is to repair <br/>\nsomething.  No more sitting down to visit and chat.  I think he <br/>\nstepped over the line with this and I just don&#39;t want him here <br/>\nundermining us and being disrespectful to our family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what would you have done and how would you have handled this? <br/>\n<br/>\n~Amanda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3244,"nextTopicId":3266}}
