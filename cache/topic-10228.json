Since installation, they have never <br/>\nworked well&#39;.  If you close them all the way, they come off the track.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWell, my 15 yo ds had a couple guys over night last night.  They slept in<br/>\nthe basement and closed the doors.  Of course one is off the track and not<br/>\noperating smoothly.  DH has asked ds several times in the past not to<br/>\nclose/open the doors.  Since he &quot;didn&#39;t listen&quot; to my DH, DH has restricted<br/>\nhis use of all electronics for the rest of the day. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen DH and I chatted about what transpired with ds, he said &quot;I expect that<br/>\nhe listens to what I ask. If he doesn&#39;t, he should feel some pain for once.&quot;<br/>\n \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHow can I best respond to this one?  Especially since DH has not asked at<br/>\nall about unschooling philosophy and why my parenting style has been<br/>\nchanging in the past few months.  With respect to learning when you are<br/>\nready to learn, wouldn&#39;t the same apply to dh?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs I posted in my intro a few weeks ago, my dh was raised in a very<br/>\nauthoritarian home.  As was I.  I just feel that there has to be a better<br/>\nway.  Punishment doesn&#39;t work.  I believe that by punishing, you put<br/>\ndistance between you and your child.  I believe that my son doesn&#39;t behave a<br/>\ncertain way to avoid punishment.  I believe he would &quot;listen&quot; better to DH,<br/>\nif he felt respected.  Because I love and respect others in my life, I don&#39;t<br/>\ndo things that may upset them.   Make sense?
