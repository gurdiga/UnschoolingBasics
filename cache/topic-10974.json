Most of my students have come from terrible home  <br/>\nsituations, and I try to think that if they have to be in school, that they are  <br/>\nbetter off with me than many other teachers.  Teaching to the test is so  much fun, <br/>\nNOT!<br/>\nBut, the ways schools work drives me crazy and so although I may be doing a  <br/>\nservice to my students, I&#39;m not necessarily doing a service to myself because  <br/>\nit&#39;s hard to take all the ps stuff all the time.  For my piece of mind, it  <br/>\nmay not be a career I&#39;m in forever.  At this time though, it pays our  bills, <br/>\nprovides health insurance, and allows me time off with my children more  often <br/>\nthan many other careers.  And I&#39;d like to think that I&#39;m making a  positive <br/>\ndifference in my high school student&#39;s lives.  <br/>\nToday they were complaining that because they are in special ed they aren&#39;t  <br/>\ngetting &quot;real&quot; diplomas and should just drop out.  We talked about how if  not <br/>\ngoing to college, then the &quot;type&quot; of diploma you earned isn&#39;t a big deal,  <br/>\nbut the skills you&#39;re gained over the years- reading and writing, reasoning,  <br/>\nbasic math, is what will help you live &quot;in the real world&quot;- practical stuff, not <br/>\n just memorizing a bunch of crap you&#39;ll forget.  We try to spend a lot of  <br/>\ntime DOING real world stuff instead of just talking about it.<br/>\nThank goodness my mom is willing to unschool with my kids while I&#39;m at  <br/>\nschool.  Although we don&#39;t call it that with her, but that&#39;s another  story!<br/>\nAmanda B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10973,"nextTopicId":10953}}
