They are simply automatically generated by Yahoo!, based on the fact that we are an education group. I treat them like I treat every other ad that I encounter; I see if it means anything to me and I then decide whether to explore it further. We&#39;re bombarded with many things which we can choose to ignore if they prove bothersome, no?
