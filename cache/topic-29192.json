I wouldn&#39;t say that telling a  <br/>\nchild they can&#39;t use something THIS time because they weren&#39;t careful LAST time <br/>\n is a natural consequence. Unfortunately the natural consequence is that the  <br/>\ncomputer could get broken or you didn&#39;t get a communication you needed -- <br/>\nthose  consequences are all on you.<br/>\n <br/>\nLimiting hours is also tricky if he&#39;s young, because he may not really know  <br/>\nwhat the heck 7 hours feels like. I don&#39;t have any brilliant ideas for <br/>\nmanaging  this until you have another computer. After you DO have another, yours may <br/>\nstill  be &quot;better&quot; and you may still need to negotiate these things. That <br/>\ncomes back to  the original issue -- you need this tool for your disability and <br/>\nwork. This  computer is YOURS, and you may share it sometimes. I assume that his <br/>\nDS is his  and he chooses when to share it...<br/>\n <br/>\nGood luck!

But things<br/>\nhave improved very much.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I am still not sure about is the issue of computer time. We<br/>\nhave discussed it before, but I lost those emails and the search<br/>\nstring is too common to get through the archives on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the situation:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is only one computer in this house and four people who want to<br/>\nuse it. I bought the computer with my money in order to advance in my<br/>\ngraphic design career.  Since my pager broke, it is literally the only<br/>\nconnection I have with the outside besides my videophone and<br/>\ninterpersonal interaction. (I&#39;m deaf)  We all try to practice respect<br/>\nwith each other&#39;s toys/equipment/etc., asking permission and so on.<br/>\nNow, the computer is a wonderful tool, but it is also sensitive and<br/>\nimportant to me and very expensive (PowerMac G5).  In the past, I let<br/>\nmy son play on it whenever he asked and for as long as he needed.  I<br/>\nwanted his needs to be met.  But then I also needed to use the<br/>\ncomputer for communication and other things.  When I asked for my<br/>\nturn, he&#39;d blow up and bang on the keys or other things that<br/>\nendangered the security of others around him.  I explained to him, how<br/>\nwould you feel if I borrowed your DS and then threw a tantrum about it<br/>\nwhen you asked for it back?  He understood it but not emotionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried several different things, the current one being limiting him<br/>\nto 7 hours a week, he can choose when and where he wants to use the<br/>\nhours.  I don&#39;t really like it because it&#39;s not very unschooly, and it<br/>\ncan lead to him looking for ways around it.  Sometimes he does well<br/>\nwith it, but it&#39;s a stopgap measure... I wonder if it is better to go<br/>\nback to unlimited usage with the respectful request of leaving it off<br/>\nduring the night so everyone can rest and if he blows up again when I<br/>\nask to use it (I do ask reasonably, like &#39;after this game is<br/>\nfinished...after this video is done, I need to check my email...&#39;) I<br/>\ncan refuse his request next time by saying politely, you were very<br/>\nrough with the computer last time and I don&#39;t really want to share it<br/>\nwith you today.  Natural consequence?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do have another, older iMac that needs its CD drive fixed and a<br/>\nreinstall of OSX.  I don&#39;t know how much it would cost to fix it.<br/>\nUntil then, what do you all think?
