When the kids were younger and needed more of my time, I did a bit of research on learning - learning isn&#39;t the same as teaching! and its fascinating how much &quot;teaching&quot; has to do with seeing oneself as a teacher rather than being about the needs of the other person. Here are a couple links on that topic:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/teaching/\">http://sandradodd.com/teaching/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"Debra Rossing &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"scoopmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Newbie here! =)","postDate":"1310470999","msgId":46975,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE2MDREOUJDRjA0MEI0NDA5MjMxQzkyOTg0N0RERUU4MDY2QTNGQFVOSUJMQUIuQ05DU09GVFdBUkUuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46969,"nextInTopic":46981,"prevInTime":46974,"nextInTime":46976,"topicId":46968,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi there.

I like plans and lists and things too. So, I plan to facilitate things - I keep an eye out for things that might be of interest to anyone in the household, offer them, make the arrangements as needed, etc. I look for the &#39;back to school&#39; sales and see if there&#39;s anything that anyone would like (for example, we usually re-stock on sketchpads and DS&#39; favorite fine line markers, my steno pads - I love the spiral bound steno pads for grocery lists, regular pens for general purpose use, etc). I note when favorite programs, movies, books might be coming up. I plan &#39;around&#39; them but I don&#39;t plan &#39;them&#39; - that is, my plan is to facilitate their plans.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

Go to bed.  Do what my kids want to do within my abilities and means.  Find opportunities to do things I can&#39;t do.  Figure out how to provide things every once in a while that are special and beyond our day to day means.  I would also say keep living like it&#39;s summer when fall comes, and winter, and spring, and summer again, so what you&#39;re doing now is a great plan for the fall :).  Since we have never done school we find our time flows differently.  Only the weather really dictates our activities, not calendars, then I do shift work and work weekends, so we&#39;re not even dictated to by what day it is.  It&#39;s quite nice and freeing.  The other rule I have is that nothing comes before family time.  Nothing at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSacha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 11, 2011, at 12:27 PM, AndreaH wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My name is Andrea, I have been homeschooling for 2 years.
