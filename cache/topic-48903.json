This sends a<br/>\nmessage to your child that you *expect* bad things<br/>\nto happen. And since children naturally tend to meet<br/>\ntheir parents&#39; unspoken expectations, worries are<br/>\nself-fulfilling prophesies.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, if you catch yourself worrying, don&#39;t worry<br/>\nabout it. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, use your awareness of worry to shift your<br/>\nfocus in the direction of what you *do* want, and<br/>\nreach for thoughts that soothe your worries:<br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;It&#39;s not the end of the world.&quot;<br/>\n    &quot;It won&#39;t last forever.&quot;<br/>\n    &quot;I&#39;ve successfully handled worse situations.&quot;<br/>\n    &quot;We always find our way.&quot;<br/>\n    ...etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore long you&#39;ll start feeling hopeful, and you&#39;ll<br/>\nfeel your heart opening, too.

AND i feel that we&#39;re lucky enough to able to move<br/>\nwhere it will be easier to homeschool which is (unfortunately) to another<br/>\nstate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nshe missed going school deleting the two bad years out of the picture. of course<br/>\nmissing friends is a given...we often do encourage to keep in touch with her<br/>\nfriends by mail, texting, phone and email. BUT it&#39;s either they&#39;re too young to<br/>\nkeep the communication steady or what?...started once a month to once in few<br/>\nmonths to zero. we (the whole family) went back for two weeks, she was sad to<br/>\nbe back and see her friends. yes another given - she&#39;s seeing herself no longer<br/>\nbelong there. yup! belonging is what she&#39;s missing, i think. also she has<br/>\nexpressed to me that by her moving and doing homeschool make her feel as she&#39;s<br/>\ndifferent from her friends as in negative way. this issue got cleared up over 8<br/>\nmonths time of having conversation with her, borrowing books for her to read to<br/>\nhave better understanding and watching some movies.(this is why i&#39;m hesitant<br/>\nabout her going for visit in december). anyway, we also manage to joined a<br/>\nlocal support group. unfortunately most kids are younger than her. but when<br/>\nfinally few of her age showed up it still took her few meetings to interact<br/>\nwith them. she&#39;s still not embracing homeschool as in making friends with<br/>\nhomeschoolers or interest in participate in co-op. i do have an urge to force<br/>\nupon her whenever she expressed to me she&#39;s bore as of have no friends. but i&#39;m<br/>\nmore than aware that forcing will only make it worse! all these PLUS being<br/>\ntween, have me on my toes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ngood thing is we as of whole family enjoy hanging out with each other whether<br/>\nwe watch tv, biking, eating, cooking.....during those years they were in PS.<br/>\nthe differences between then and now is like everyone knows it&#39;s 24/7 now. so i<br/>\ndid expected for siblings friction more so but when i actually dealing with it,<br/>\ni&#39;m more fustrated than i expected myself to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nas for my husband, his way of supporting is doing his best on not questioning<br/>\nme, he do the cooking and occasional cleaning as we agree upon when we were<br/>\nplanning to move and homeschool. he&#39;s semi retiree - yes. can&#39;t ask for more<br/>\nfrom a man, i know. also i admit, i got all 3 of my girls doing chores since<br/>\nthey were toddlers, so my house being in order is part of our daily life. in<br/>\nthis new adventure approach, they are even more willing, i must say. so all<br/>\nthese makes less of the struggle for me adopt deschool/unschool. i&#39;m thankful<br/>\nand feel lucky.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nabout my daughter and unschooling work or not are not a separate issue to me<br/>\nbecause when i see her crying as she talk about missing the place, and friends,<br/>\ni felt as i&#39;m doing more harm to her than when her former teacher intimidated<br/>\nher, mistreated her to the point she doesn&#39;t feel safe in school. based on this<br/>\nfeeling i&#39;m starting to ask myself - is it a mistake?

But does she really miss her old school, or just being with her friends? If she misses her friends, can she connect with them regularly on Facebook or Skype, or by phone? (And why should she NOT visit them if she has the chance?)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter&#39;s best friend moved away - all the way across the country - 6 years ago, when the two girls were 13. They have kept in touch by phone, Skype, and Facebook all these years, and my dd has gone to California to visit her twice, and her friend has come here once.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took my daughter about a year to find a new &quot;best friend&quot; here. So now she has two best friends, one in California, and one who lives nearby. But she was very lonely for a while, after her first friend moved away. She doesn&#39;t make friends easily. She participated in activities and occasional classes with other homeschooled kids, and she had the opportunity to meet lots of other kids. She just didn&#39;t really &quot;click&quot; with any of them for a long time. (When she was about 15, she started feeling more comfortable with groups, and the kids she socialized with from the homeschool group all became Facebook friends, and she has had more of a social network since then.)   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling question - about whether it&#39;s &quot;working&quot; or not - is separate from the issue of how your daughter can keep in touch with her old friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf moving back to the place you used to live is not an option, and she has to figure her life out where she is living now, unschooling is about you encouraging her to decide how she would like to spend her time, and you facilitating her interests in whatever ways you can. And it&#39;s about you being there to listen when she wants to talk, and being generally supportive of her current choices, even if they change frequently. If she tries something, and then decides it&#39;s not for her, then the &quot;something&quot; that she tried may not have &quot;worked&quot; for her, but that doesn&#39;t mean that *unschooling* isn&#39;t working. It just means that she is still exploring and trying to find a new passion or interest. Unschooling is about giving her the freedom to make her own choices, to be herself, and you trusting and helping her to explore and figure out what&#39;s right for her. (When I say &quot;helping&quot;, I mean helping her to the extent that she wants your help. Listening to her and accepting her as she is is a very good way to start in that process.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRelaxing, &quot;deschooling&quot;, and spending a lot of time watching TV or online, can be fine too, especially if she gets something that&#39;s personally meaningful to her from the TV shows or the internet time, OR if she needs the time to think, and figure out not only what she might want to do with her time, but how to open up to you about how she&#39;s feeling. Teens don&#39;t always know how to express everything they&#39;re feeling and thinking. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet her know that you love her, that you care, and that you&#39;re there for her, when she wants to talk. But if she needs her own space, give her that space. You can&#39;t &quot;fix&quot; her, but you can honor her own process of adjusting, figuring her life out, and becoming herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s the aspect of togetherness that others mentioned. Watching TV together has been a big part of my family&#39;s life. There are certain shows we all love. As my kids got older, we started enjoying watching lots of YouTube videos together, too. (YouTube didn&#39;t exist when they were younger. LOL!) There were quite a few activities we enjoyed out of the house together, too. Attending plays and concerts. Swimming. Hanging out at the park with our homeschool group. Volunteering.<br/>\nAre there any TV shows or types/genres of videos that you and your daughter (and the other kids) all enjoy? Are there other activities that you all enjoy doing together? <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling &quot;works&quot; when you trust your children to make their own choices, and let them know that you&#39;re there to help them do what they want to do, and to do those things *with* them, if they want you to.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling &quot;works&quot; for the parents when the parents also have interests, activities, hobbies, etc, that they enjoy. What do you like to do for fun and/or relaxation?<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Randi Lee &lt;randily41@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s either i&#39;m so fogged up or you just understand what i&#39;m not seeing....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; yes. i felt a need to fixed her. wants her to moved on so she will be happier sooner - isn&#39;t it what a mother wants for her child?

It never hurts to spend a little more time where your kid is (unless she wants to be alone!) and it&#39;s a good way to get a sense of what&#39;s going on.

Parents and sometimes older, previously schooled kids, struggle with unschooling because they&#39;ve come to disbelieve one or more of those things and instead are attached to the misconception that it is possible and/or desirable to control what another person learns. For some parents, that misconception gets tied up in personal baggage such that they can&#39;t create an environment in which learning flows freely and joyfully.

I think the question is more easily answered in terms of what you want unschooling for.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is a tool. Does it make sense to ask if a screw driver is working? The screwdriver (as a concept) never doesn&#39;t work ;-) But sometimes people don&#39;t know how to use it. Sometimes their expectations of what it can do are unreasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter is to think in terms of what you want to provide for your daughter. Like ways to explore what interest her.

It&#39;s either because you&#39;re decisive or because you&#39;re also indecisive and it&#39;s troubling to see it in someone else ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n*Every* choice we make has both good parts and bad parts. It&#39;s natural for people to feel two ways about something. It&#39;s especially true when someone hasn&#39;t made a choice for themselves. Since you pulled her out, it&#39;s natural for her to pump up the good parts of school, down play the bad parts and do the reverse to unschooling. It will take time for her to work through it. It will help a lot if you let her know she can go to school if she wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you moved and then started school at home for 4-5 months. That&#39;s a huge change for anyone, especially for someone who didn&#39;t have a choice in either.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, it will take her longer to deschool. Expect it to take 1 month for each year she was in school. And the summer doesn&#39;t count! She has always had the summer off so she can&#39;t deschool if she wasn&#39;t expecting to go to school. And the deschooling clock restarts if you panic and start doing school again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is she just requested all those to explore, to play along with my interest in unschooling her?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unless she&#39;s been a big people-pleaser in the past, I can&#39;t see why she&#39;d put herself through all that you listed if she wasn&#39;t interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible she wants to do all those things because she feels they will fix the unsettled feeling in her. It&#39;s possible she will find out they don&#39;t. Or that some don&#39;t. Or that she only needs one. By picking then trying things out, she&#39;s learning more about herself and what the feelings she has mean and what they&#39;re asking her for. She&#39;s not going to get it right at first. She&#39;ll get better at it each choice she makes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is she&#39;s being tween causing the friction we often have(the attitude toward the family and calling names to her siblings)?

What she needs is someone to help her feel as comfortable as she can as she recovers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs do your other kids. She needs to not be calling her siblings names. (The less prickly she feels, the less she&#39;ll feel like directing the prickliness at her siblings.) Be more present. Be aware of the buildup.

BUT wished we didn&#39;t have to moved in the first place. this comment of hers can define in few different ways. it can be she&#39;s coming along or it can also be she likes unschooling but rather go to back to PS that her friends are in. yes. not to PS where we are, it&#39;s the one where&#39;s all her friends are at.....she doesn&#39;t seems to be depressed or sad or in any negative state,even altho not into any kind of homeschool group/activity.she will goes to a week camp here and there, attended computer classes in the library, mostly borrowed alots of books from library to read, go on line to either play games or google celebrities that caught her eyes or about clothings or watch glee. yes she&#39;s into singing and acting as for now. she used to serious about gymnastic and was in a team. just recently announced, she wants to quit due to the reason of gymnastic will stop her from growing(she wants to be aleast 6feet tall). her so-so interest for orchestra also comes to a full stop. her request for &quot;this school year&quot; is explore into acting from hollywood to b&#39;way and everything in between, how and where human started, alot of sewing projects, learn spanish and french, and want to understand about electricity. does this seems like she&#39;s sad or depressed?  <br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;m confused and worry because her behavior doesn&#39;t indicate she&#39;s sad, depress...etc. BUT yet she often wish &quot;nothing happen so she didn&#39;t need to moved and still in PS with her friends. my question is, is she just requested all those to explore, to play along with my interest in unschooling her? we just step into this journey. my on and off with deschooling IS getting better. i do see learning take place with her and her siblings(dd-9 and dd-6, even though we just started.<br/>\nso back to my questions - is her behavior part of deschool process?<br/>\nis she&#39;s being tween causing the friction we often have(the attitude toward the family and calling names to her siblings)?
