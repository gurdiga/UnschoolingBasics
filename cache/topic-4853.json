It just didn&#39;t seem possible to learn<br/>\nmath without a formal approach.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut learning math in real life looks *nothing* like learning math in school.<br/>\nMy daughter has done *sinfully* little math in her 13 years and yet has a<br/>\nfundamental understanding of how numbers work which is way more important<br/>\nthan memorizing methods. Once they have a fundamental understanding of what<br/>\naddition and subtraction and multiplication and division and percent and so<br/>\non are by using them and seeing what contexts they appear in, then more<br/>\nformal math is much much easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem in school is they can&#39;t test for understanding. They can only<br/>\ntest for memoriziation. So school have to teach things that can be memorized<br/>\nso they can test them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich has little to do with understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, kids learn how to add and subtract by borrowing and carrying.<br/>\nAnd they can be tested to see if they&#39;ve memorized the steps to go through<br/>\nto borrow and carry. But when faced with a problem in real life, like how<br/>\nmuch money will they have left over after they buy a toy, they are often<br/>\nbaffled because they don&#39;t really understand how numbers work and don&#39;t have<br/>\na fundamental understanding of what they&#39;re really doing when they&#39;re<br/>\nborrowing and carrying. They&#39;re just going through the motions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in real life with unschooling, the fundamental understanding comes<br/>\nfirst. And then if a child is shown a rote formula, they can grasp it fairly<br/>\nquickly because they understand why it&#39;s being done that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool (and maths cd-roms) are asking kids to learn the abstract before they<br/>\nunderstand what numbers are and how they work. With unschooling they can go<br/>\nthe other way and gain an understanding and then the abstract -- should they<br/>\never need it -- is way easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath in school is sort of like learning the mechanics of Spanish grammar and<br/>\nmemorizing vocabulary but without being exposed to the living language: no<br/>\nspeaking, no reading, no hearing. It&#39;s all just rules with no reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s not how kids learn language (or anything else.) Kids learn<br/>\nlanguage as a *side effect* by using it imperfectly to get what they want --<br/>\npicked up, shown something, juice. They don&#39;t learn grammar and vocabulary.<br/>\nThey just aborb those by using the parts of language they understand that<br/>\nwill get them what they want. (In fact the best foreign language programs<br/>\nare immersion programs where adults learn much like children.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMath is the same way. Kids use numbers and get an understanding of how<br/>\nnumbers work as a side effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I feel worried my children will have regrets I didn&#39;t push them to take their<br/>\n&gt; exams like their peers have done- you know the<br/>\n&gt; exams-college-university-job-retirement-death treadmill!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard to give suggestions since the education system is different in the<br/>\nUK.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut is there a university &quot;track&quot; for adults?
