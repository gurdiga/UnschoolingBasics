That really makes me laugh.<br/>\nUnschooling is making up your own cookies. It&#39;s smashing the mold.<br/>\nIt&#39;s coloring outside the lines dancing to your own beat. It&#39;s<br/>\nsculpting a life of passions. It&#39;s freedom. It&#39;s anything BUT<br/>\ncookie-cutter.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a couple definitions of &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; I pulled from the web:<br/>\n<br/>\nMain Entry: cookie-cutter<br/>\nFunction: adjective<br/>\n: marked by lack of originality or distinction &lt;cookie-cutter shopping<br/>\nmalls&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAdj.\t1.\tcookie-cutter - having the same appearance (as if<br/>\nmass-produced); &quot;a suburb of cookie-cutter houses&quot;<br/>\nsame - closely similar or comparable in kind or quality or quantity or<br/>\ndegree;<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmmmm.....<br/>\nUnschoolers are leaving the mass-produced, lack-of-originality world<br/>\nBEHIND. I&#39;m not really sure how this phrase got applied to<br/>\nunschooling. It&#39;s really completely innacurate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a person heads into new territory with a lack of understanding,<br/>\nit&#39;s easy to get sidetracked and think &quot;how will unschooling work in<br/>\nTHIS situation?&quot; <br/>\nBut it&#39;s really not about unschooling and more about healthy human<br/>\ninteractions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen one asks oneself &quot;how do I facilitate this situation FOR my<br/>\nchild?&quot; it helps open new doors. Falling back on old, less-effective<br/>\ntools like punishment and control is maybe comfortable, but fails to<br/>\nmove us forward in gathering new tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning how to mindfully parent takes patience (with ourselves too)<br/>\nand a willingness to quit using cookie-cutter methods. Opening<br/>\nourselves up to the colorful world of creative problem solving might<br/>\nseem overwhelming. But it leads to healthier relationships in all of<br/>\nlife and it helps provide a nurturing environment for joyful<br/>\nunschooling to blossom.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25247,"nextTopicId":25266}}
