I&#39;ve been lurking around on the always learning group and feel like I&#39;m still so new to this that maybe this group could help me more.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Jenna.  I have a 12 yr old ds, a 10 yr old dd, and a 22mo old dd.  My big kids were in school until 2 years ago the 1st year we did a lot of &quot;school at home&quot; but this year we have tried to move towards unschooling.  It&#39;s been hard- me kids love it, but my husband does not.  My kids have met some friends on line and we are going to the conference in October.  They are very excited.  I&#39;m trying to get my husband to go with me, but still haven&#39;t gotten an answer out of him.  If anyone has some suggestions I would appreciate it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Jenna<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"New to group","postDate":"1109955763","msgId":4997,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQwYTRiais5bnZxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":4995,"nextInTopic":5688,"prevInTime":4996,"nextInTime":4998,"topicId":4016,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Finally school is fitting in with the rest of our lives.

We have been <br/>\nunschooling for about a year.  We gradually worked up to unschooling <br/>\nbecause of silly hang ups I had about homeschooling and just plain <br/>\nignorance on the subject.  It has been a wonderful year.  Finally <br/>\nschool is fitting in with the rest of our lives.  The boys always had <br/>\nfreedom to make their own decision on everything else in their lives <br/>\nexcept for certain things about school--so school seemed like such a <br/>\ndrag and disconnected with real life.  Now I understand that real <br/>\nlife is the best education one can get and it&#39;s real learning not <br/>\nuseless facts noone ever uses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very excited about joining this group.  I belong to a homeschool <br/>\ngroup, but I find I need to converse with people who have been <br/>\nunschooling and can help me on this journey.
