I especially liked knowing that for others it was quite a process of depropramming too.  What was your church?  Right away when I read that it sounds like your experience I let out a sigh of relief - it helps so much to know that others have grown up in something rigid and have successfully made the transition to an unschooling lifestyle.  Often when I&#39;m with my girls these days my memory flashes back to times when I was with families when I was part of the church and thought, wow, am I ever glad I know a better way!!!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks for your support, I need lots right now.  I feel very alone in my circle, in my city, I really haven&#39;t met anyone else who is truly unschooling.  All the places I used to go - playroom/coffee hangouts, etc. seem to be full of moms and dads whose language to their kids makes me cringe, and who are doing things so differently than we&#39;re trying to do!  I want to surround myself with other like-minded people, but that hasn&#39;t happened yet.  There is such pressure out there to just do things the way most people have always done them - I even had one mom glomp onto something I said today and she started &quot;educating&quot; me about the right preschool for my girls!!!  All I said was a break would be nice, and she thought I meant I was ready to ship them off for 5 mornings a week.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;m reading Naomi Aldort&#39;s book right now &quot;Raising our Children Raising Ourselves&quot; and it&#39;s really helping me to move through some of the old stuff that keeps me from being 100% with my girls of the way I&#39;d like to be - stuff that I thought I&#39;d worked through but as soon as I had kids there it was again at another level, yikes.  Raising my girls the way that was shown to me and sending them off to school to have someone else take them on would be SO the easy way out for me, I really see that, but I would be so filled with regret because I do know a better way for them.  I really feel like it may perhaps be a bit of a sacrifice, but what a gift to them (I wish I&#39;d been given the gift of unschooling!!!).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I am so glad I was led to John Holt&#39;s books and then on to so much other help from there, which includes this email group, really the first time I&#39;ve had the chance to have conversation with other unschoolers.  I also read Rue Kream&#39;s book and LOVED it.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi<br/>\n  <br/>\nRen Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          ~~It was seen as &#39;evil&#39; in the church I grew up in,<br/>\nsomething that was implied that Jesus would never do.

It was good for me to read what Ren wrote to you about tv because I have my own issues with it as well.  I grew up in a house with no tv, and until now our kids haven&#39;t watched tv, just dvds that I&#39;ve selected as being appropriate for their age - not too fast moving, supportive messages, etc.  They have about 8-9 of them and they choose what they want to watch, and when they&#39;re done they just get up and start playing again.  I would LOVE to have no history, no story, no feelings about this black box in our living room, but I DO!  It was seen as &#39;evil&#39; in the church I grew up in, something that was implied that Jesus would never do.  Now I believe that&#39;s a load of malarky, but I bought into it for a long time, AND, because it was so forbidden, watched very compulsively and addictively every chance I got, then got my own when I was around 30 (when I left the church), and watched for a few years straight until I got bored with it.  I have no<br/>\n desire to create that sort of dynamic for my girls, and yet I know my energy around the thing isn&#39;t completely clear either.  I guess the main thing is that I&#39;m aware of it and I&#39;m open to having it shift so I don&#39;t pass it on.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Usually when the girls ask to watch something I put it on and go get something, anything (!) done, but yesterday the girls asked to watch a Thomas the Train movie I bought recently and I wanted to watch it with them to see the content so we snuggled on the couch and ended up having the nicest time together all under a blanket - I even ended up getting in a much needed nap! :o)  So the reframing process has begun.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I am continuing to marvel at how this journey is SO not just for the kids.  I am doing SO much learning and growing since we took the plunge into unschooling.  I&#39;m such a believer now that this is the way our family is meant to operate - we are totally on purpose now :o).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks again so much for all the support, it means alot to me to have an avenue to ask questions and get feedback, especially because my dh isn&#39;t quite as on board with all this as I am.  Does anyone have any suggestions for websites, avenues, etc. that would help him &quot;see the light&quot;? :o)))  There is such a difference in the flow during the day and then after he comes home it is slightly more restricted because he doesn&#39;t really understand what we&#39;re doing.  I&#39;ve tried to talk with him, but quite honestly, he would hear it much better if it was coming from someone else.  I know Alfie Kohn is coming to our city soon, so I&#39;d like to take him to that, but any more suggestions???<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi<br/>\n  <br/>\nKendrah Nilsestuen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:carebear-79@...\">carebear-79@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          &lt;&lt;Thank you so much Ren for your compassionate email.

But just because we talk about what works, doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmean there aren&#39;t very difficult moments in our homes.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nJalen (6) and Sierra (10) are the most likely to devolve into hitting<br/>\nor some form of aggression. Mostly because he doesn&#39;t have as many<br/>\nproblem-solving tools yet and she gets overwhelmed with him at times.<br/>\nHeck, *I* get overwhelmed at his intensity sometimes and she&#39;s got a<br/>\nlot less life experience than I do to draw upon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no failure at modeling respect and peaceful interactions when<br/>\nyour children have rough moments. I think those struggles are a valid<br/>\nand important part of their learning process.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, we arbitrate or intervene or be proactive when they need it. But<br/>\nwhen things fall apart and the process doesn&#39;t end up with some<br/>\npeaceful result, that&#39;s ok. Sometimes human interactions are messy!<br/>\n<br/>\nI trust that together we will learn better and more effective ways of<br/>\nworking things out. Together we get frustrated and do it different the<br/>\nnext time. Or just accept some frustration and struggle as part of the<br/>\nhuman experience.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we hug and laugh and move on. The process of problem solving and<br/>\ntrying operate democratically isn&#39;t perfect (or maybe the process is,<br/>\nbut humans are geared for trial and error learning).

If you feel sure that is the case, and it&#39;s not really a <br/>\ndeep love of hers after all, then I&#39;d suggest that you talk with her about it <br/>\nand see if you can connect with her about what is driving her to continue. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not that workbooks and cirriculum are not allowed, or a not a part of <br/>\nunschooling - it&#39;s the enforcement of them. Anything that interferes with the child <br/>\nleading, or with their delight in the learning, quickly becomes schooly and <br/>\nthen not unschooling at all. Even if it&#39;s all painting all the time - if the <br/>\nchild isn&#39;t wanting to and not enjoying it for their own sake, it&#39;s not <br/>\nunschooling.

My","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-966456127\">Hi, my name is Jodi and I&#39;ve posted a few times here.  We have twin 3 year old girls (I would LOVE to hear from anyone who is unschooling multiples!).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My question today is regarding their ages and stages...I have ordered tons of books, and have read so much my head is spinning with ideas and information, which is fantastic and a bit overwhelming too.  I have read so much about the way that unschooling incorporates the whole child, the whole family, everything about everything!  So far our girls have a pretty predictable routine, but there has been no fighting it, we pretty much have let them determine what the &#39;schedule&#39; will be  For example they recently stopped napping in the afternoons so they are tired at 7:30 p.m. instead of 9:30 p.m., so it&#39;s very easy to tuck them into bed at that time because they are honestly played out and ready to sleep.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I get that with older kids they can just put themselves to bed when they are tired, eat when they are hungry, etc., and that at some point they make a connection between when they are tired and when they need to sleep.  I also get that some of you have older kids that model also for the little ones.  When my girls go to bed later than 7:30 (I do encourage them to keep moving with the bedtime routine so it happens sooner rather than later, but in a pretty relaxed way) they still wake up at 6:30 a.m. and are cranky, then they refuse to take a nap even though they are completely exhausted and obviously could hugely benefit from a nap.  If they happen to fall asleep in the car they have a dramatic mood change for the rest of the day which isn&#39;t just about making things easier for me, but obviously they deal with everything more easily too (I know how I feel when I&#39;m that tired!!!).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So...ho many decisions do unschoolers make for their younger children??  We have always been a child-centered household, and have no problem letting them determine lots and lots of things for themselves, but it does seem that toddlers need some guidance in some areas while they are still massively learing about how they work, how relationships work, our household works, figuring it all out.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The other issue we have is them fighting between each other so much.  We try to model calm, respectful, happy, etc., and I&#39;m mystifed by how much they have power struggles with each other when they don&#39;t see it happening around them too much.  How much am I supposed to interfere to help them work things out and how much am I supposed to leave alone?  They are getting bigger and while they are no longer biting each other because they have more words to use, the other day Skye hit Jade on the head with a pot and left a big egg on her head and we all ended up on the floor bawling.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Any input/feedback on all this (and any other little thing you think I need to know :o)) would be MOST appreciated right now!!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;m SO glad I have you guys to ask this stuff too.  I&#39;m beginning to see how unschooling MYSELF involves every single area of my life and all my thinking.

We had a child who  <br/>\nwanted to keep working after pulling from school, but NOT because  <br/>\nthey enjoyed it but because they bought into the idea that without  <br/>\nbook learning they would not know anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s wonderful that you&#39;ve come to unschooling, it&#39;s a  <br/>\ngrowing process for parents as well as kids. I&#39;ve enjoyed finding  <br/>\nmyself and deschooling myself.<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (12), Breanna (10), Emily (9), Rachel (7), Sam (6), Dan  <br/>\n(4), and Avari Rose (2)<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Dec 18, 2007, at 9:12 AM, Mara wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My question is that my daughter loves Maths<br/>\n&gt; &gt; workbooks and actually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; asks to do them.

As I understand it,<br/>\nUnschooling is not to avoid anything that looks<br/>\nschool-like. It encompasses ALL the wonderful things<br/>\nlife has to offer - like you have already realized:<br/>\ntrusting your children to live and learn when and how<br/>\nthey like to do it - if that involves workbooks,<br/>\nthat&#39;s just another tool like anything else. If your<br/>\ndaughter has fun doing them and actually asks for<br/>\nthem, sit down with her and do them. As time goes on<br/>\nshe might move on to other fun ways to play with math<br/>\nand numbers (I am sure some people here have some good<br/>\nsuggestions  that you could offer her). But if she<br/>\nkeeps enjoying the workbooks and asks for them I see<br/>\nno harm in doing them. When my 3-year-old asks me to<br/>\nprint letters for him I do it, just as I let him play<br/>\nand experiment with the toilet mechanism or what<br/>\nhappens if you put all kinds of kitchen things<br/>\ntogether to make a &#39;soup&#39;. My 6 year old has no<br/>\ninterest in workbooks and when they have been given to<br/>\nus before by well-meaning relatives he finds them<br/>\nboring . He did love maze books though and could not<br/>\nget enough of them. My 3-year-old actually loves some<br/>\nof the &#39;learning&#39; games that my older never asks for.<br/>\nThey are all so different and it is so amazing to<br/>\nwatch them learn and figure things out in their own<br/>\nway -<br/>\nAll the best to you<br/>\nMara<br/>\nwith 4 boys (20, 16, 6 and 3) and a wonderful husband<br/>\n<br/>\n--- emmakania &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:emmakania@...\">emmakania@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi I&#39;m Emma and I have just started deschooling my<br/>\n&gt; kids Josh age 8 <br/>\n&gt; and Ellie age 5.
