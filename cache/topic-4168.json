What I have done in the past when my mother has disagreed with<br/>\nsome parenting decision or practice, is to find her some information from a<br/>\nsource that she respects and send it along. I mean an article or webpage,<br/>\nnot a 1000 page tome. My mother is married to a doctor and has a great deal<br/>\nof respect for the medical profession, so I sent her an article from the<br/>\nAmerican Academy of Pediatricians about extended breastfeeding, rather than<br/>\none from say, Mothering Magazine. The information is largely the same. It<br/>\nmay take some digging on your part, but there is information out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might try sharing some of your and dh&#39;s journey to homeschooling, and<br/>\nshow them that you have educated yourself about it (I&#39;m assuming you have),<br/>\nso even if they continue to disagree they at least know this is not just<br/>\nsome idea you have pulled out of your ass. If they are strongly convinced<br/>\nthat school is best you might direct them to some anti-mandatory-schooling<br/>\nliterature such as John Taylor Gatto. If they think social services are a<br/>\nbunch of sweethearts, you might direct them to some webpages about the sorry<br/>\nunderfunded state of the foster care system and what the kids actually go<br/>\nthrough in these situations. You might also try sharing some stories of<br/>\nhomeschoolers going to college and being &quot;successful&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother strategy is to ask them why they believe what they believe and to<br/>\ndefine some of their terms (like &quot;amount to anything&quot;), if you can stand to<br/>\nlisten. Sometimes just having a vent is enough for people - you do *not*<br/>\nhave to take their advice, just thank them for their opinion without<br/>\nnecessarily defending yourself verbally. Sometimes in verbalizing their<br/>\nideas people come to see that they are unfounded or illogical. Sometimes<br/>\ncalm, uninvolved listening can give them the idea that they have made a<br/>\ngreat impression on you, and they will back off. Saying something like, &quot;You<br/>\nhave given me a lot to think about&quot; is neutral yet true and does not commit<br/>\nyou to any immediate change in activity. (Then send the articles etc later<br/>\nso the emotion of face-to-face is removed).<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH it seems like most people at some time or another have had to tell<br/>\ntheir parents and relatives, either kindly or bluntly, to butt out. I have<br/>\ndone it by immediately ending the phone conversation. My dh has done it with<br/>\nhis Mom by just gently saying he didn&#39;t want to hear her negativity - she<br/>\nthen hangs up and we are freed from her opining for varying lengths of time.<br/>\nMany people have used variations on &quot;We understand and appreciate that you<br/>\ncare about the kids just as we do, but they are dh&#39;s and my responsibility<br/>\nand if you want to be part of their lives, we need you to respect our<br/>\ndecisions about how we are raising them.&quot; Unity of purpose with dh and<br/>\nyourself is important here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people continue to let the children&#39;s accomplishments speak for<br/>\nthemselves. I send along art work that Jayn has done, or tell happy stories<br/>\nof some achievement - like writing thank you cards. When Mum sees Jayn she<br/>\nis always pretty impressed. I just don&#39;t do any kind of &quot;schoolish&quot;<br/>\nconversation about what *I* might be doing with Jayn, since that is nothing<br/>\nremotely schoolish. Walking the line between full honest disclosure (only<br/>\nrecommended for the supportive and knowledgeable) and not giving up<br/>\nopportunities for criticism and suggestions by seeming uncommitted, can be<br/>\ntough.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally if they do threaten to or actually do take some kind of legal<br/>\naction, since your post implied that some of them are likely to seek<br/>\ncustody, I suggest that rather than HSLDA, you try to find legal help<br/>\nthrough www.nheld.com (National Home Education Legal Defense) a secular<br/>\norganization which does not have any further political agenda outside of<br/>\nhomeschooling issues. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour relatives may not realize the harm they are doing to family unity and<br/>\ntheir own standing in your family. I agree with the other poster who<br/>\nsuggested that your dh should be the one to deal with his relatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course the big assumption we are all making here is that you are *not*<br/>\nneglecting your children&#39;s health, safety or emotional development, and that<br/>\nyou *are* engaged and facilitating their interests, and that you *are* doing<br/>\nwhatever paperwork is necessary in your State. The other thing that might be<br/>\nworth examining for yourself is whether your children actually are happy<br/>\nhomeschooling (or unschooling). If they would genuinely and mindfully prefer<br/>\nto be in school at the moment, they should have that choice. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

So as we were doing this I would look at my mom and go, &quot;Math&quot;  and later, &quot;History&quot; and also &quot;Cultural Studies.&quot;  It ticked her off, but it sort of made a point to her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my mom is amazed at how well my children read and do math and understand scientific theory, but she always will say, &quot;The read (do math) so well.

My mother is not supportive at all of homeschooling and I have disappointed her in revisiting homeschooling with &quot;her grandchildren.&quot;  I don&#39;t talk to her about curriculum, field trips, or anything else related to what they are learning.  When she asks how their studies are going I say the same thing that I said when I was breastfeeding them (another disappointment - although now she is a big supporter of women breastfeeding their *babies*) &quot;They are doing just so great!  I&#39;m amazed every day at their new and wonderful accomplishments.&quot;  She knows they are smart as they are constantly astounding her with little bits of trivia and &quot;feats of wonder.&quot;  (Emily loves math and does stuff in her head which my mom thinks is from some wonderful thing she learned in school - HA!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t believe that it is any of my family&#39;s business to know what we do and how we do it.  If homeschooling is legal where you are and you are following the letter of the law, there is no way that they can take your children from you provided that they are healthy and not ill-treated or neglected.  It&#39;s really an idle threat.  Your family would have to prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that your children are in danger, neglected, or in some other way in harm (either through ommission or commission).  If anything a judge (if it ever got before a judge because a good lawyer would know when to take action and when it would be futile) would perhaps have your children evaluated to see if they are &quot;on grade level.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nChange your attitude, not your family.  You may never be able to change them.  As wonderful as my children have done being in their home environment, my mother continually tells me how good they would do in school.  BTDT and they hated it.  My mom isn&#39;t going to change, so I changed the information that I gave her.  I quit trying to sell her on homeschooling because she will probably always see schooling as &quot;best&quot; and homeschooling as inferior to her standard.  She jumped for joy when my ex-sil put my niece in school this past year after 4 years of homeschooling.  She tells me on a fairly regular basis about some new teacher she has met who would love to have &quot;such-n-such child&quot; in his/her class or a new school or magnet program that has an opening or has started doing something that would interest my children.  I have been homeschooling on and off (mostly on) for the past 4 years and she seems to fight harder and harder for my children&#39;s &quot;right to an education&quot; than ever before.  She also believes that I am being disserviced because I don&#39;t get enough &quot;free time.&quot;  Like it must be some drudgery to be with my children &quot;all the time.&quot;  UGH!!  I love being with my kids and I have scheduled free time each month (and irregular free time through my Pampered Chef business - although I usually end up taking one of them as my helper) and my children are at the ages where I can leave them at home without fearing that they are going to burn the house down or go running out into the street naked (well, not the street but the yard could be a good possiblity :-D )<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will probably never convince them or change their attitude.
