Thanks for putting that out there!<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nI heard that &quot;well-rounded&quot; came from the days of the leisure upper  <br/>\nclasses. <br/>\n They had little else to do with their time except learn to make  good <br/>\nsocial <br/>\nconversation.  Being a well-rounded person, being able to  converse on <br/>\na wide <br/>\nrange of topics, was important (so you weren&#39;t bored  stiff!).<br/>\n <br/>\nThe middle classes always wanted what the upper had, so when the middle  <br/>\nclass started to become &quot;educated&quot;, they believed they wanted <br/>\nwell-rounded  too.  <br/>\nPlus, it is a great time filler in school.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo well-rounded, unless it is a personal goal, is just an intellectual  <br/>\nsuperiority complex and a keep-up-with-the-jones&#39; mentality.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC, brought up to be well-rounded (and achieved it  <br/>\nphysically!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!
