My parents live north of <br/>\nCincinnati about 20 miles. They homeschooled my younger bio sis and I <br/>\nfor a while (my last three years of school and my sisters last years as <br/>\nwell). I unschool my 3 children (ages 7, 4, and 4) and my parents are <br/>\ncomtemplating pulling their children from pre-school/ kindergarten to <br/>\nhomeschool, though I&#39;m not sure that she will be taking <br/>\nan &#39;unschooling&#39; approach. My mother is, however, very supportive of my <br/>\nchoice to unschool my children, and will stand up for me and my choice <br/>\nto anyone, including my sister-in-law (a public school teacher who has <br/>\nactually told me I&#39;m doing an injustice to my children by unschooling <br/>\nthem!). <br/>\nIf you&#39;d like their contact info, please email me off-list.
