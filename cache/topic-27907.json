I could ask her. I don&#39;t wear it myself and never have, but she has worn it since she was five years old. She had fake little girl makeup at first and then a neighbor gave her some out of her own collection, half used mascara, etc. <br/>\nShe would know what inexpensive brands you can buy at the local drugstore are the best. Of course, you may want to find some extra money and buy the better stuff because apparently there are huge differences in the content of it and the more natural stuff costs more, but is better for the skin.<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Faith Void&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:littlemsvoid@...\">littlemsvoid@...</a>&gt; <br/>\nI can not afford make up counter make up, that&#39;s way out of our<br/>\n(small) budget.
