It just brings up so much for me all the time, stuff that I know is completely MY issue, but is being triggered by giving my girls what I was not given - no limits, no punishment, and man, does that push my buttons!!!  I believe what a bodyworker told me recently, that in her experience there is always something under the anger, and that has proven true for me.  Hurt, fear, shame, sadness, those are the main ones I&#39;ve discovered.  And when I breathe, the anger does move, and often faster than I would have expected.  It&#39;s still crazy though, how often I forget to just breathe!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have found useful exercises for myself in both Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves (Naomi Aldort) and Raising the Spirited Child.  The truth is that I have a very intense temperament myself, and trying to be calm earth mother all the time is going against the way I&#39;m put together.  I believe now that just as it is completely disrepectful to try to shut down intenseness in my daughter, it is dishonouring to try and do it to myself as well, to try and try to be someone I&#39;m not.  I want the authentic me to be present with my girls, not some put together version of myself that isn&#39;t real.  I often make a argh gutteral sound when I&#39;m really frustrated/angry, not directed at anyone, just a release of the &#39;bees in my body&#39;.  And I&#39;ve talked to my girls about what being angry/frustrated looks like while respecting everyone around - and for me, making that sound is sometimes what it looks like.  I too want them to know it&#39;s okay to be angry or anything other feeling for that<br/>\n matter, and so modelling healthy anger is pretty important around here.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I look forward to what the wise ones have to say about this, because I think it&#39;s a VERY important discussion, especially for those of us new to RU and healing lots of old stuff while trying to give differently to our children.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi                            <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
