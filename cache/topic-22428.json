All<br/>\nthose &quot;why&quot; questions. I still remember when DS was about 6 or so and he<br/>\njust wanted to know why windows are called &quot;windows&quot; and so on - not<br/>\nonly did I show him how to read the etymology info in the dictionary if<br/>\nhe so chose (I could do it if he wanted me to, sometimes he wanted to do<br/>\nit himself) but I found a wonderful etymology website that we all love<br/>\nto use to look stuff up, added it as a bookmark to his computer - us<br/>\n&quot;edumakated gr&#39;ups&quot; learned lots too!<br/>\n <br/>\nThey also make for great discussion of possibilities questions - why do<br/>\nyou think it&#39;s called a window?
