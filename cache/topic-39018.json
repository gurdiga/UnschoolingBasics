My neice is six and goes to school.  She already has no interest in doing anything that might be anything like learning on the weekends.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Sun, 3/22/09, Michelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:homeschoolmum22@...\">homeschoolmum22@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nI&#39;m tired of all of this.

We&#39;ve been homeschooling ds5 for nearly a year<br/>\nnow. My first exposure to homeschooling methods was through The Well-Trained<br/>\nMind. I really liked it, but wanted to see what else was out there. I&#39;ve<br/>\nexplored many methods and have learned a lot. When I first learned about<br/>\nunschooling, I was like most of the doubters out there, but after I had a<br/>\nbetter look and read some of Mr. Holt&#39;s fantastic work, I was pretty much<br/>\nconvinced. But then I&#39;d gaze once more of my copy of TWTM and think, &#39;yeah,<br/>\nbut...&#39; I could fill in a lot things in that blank. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the past few months we&#39;ve been working on reading (at his request),<br/>\nhandwriting (he loves it), art (reading stories that feature a colour, then<br/>\ntotal creative freedom), hands-on math activities (he loves this, too), and<br/>\nskills such as learning his address, phone number, etc. I also read to him<br/>\nfor an hour to 2 hours each day, which are the best parts of the day (this<br/>\nis not scheduled, but a lovely routine) He really enjoys all of this, but I<br/>\nfeel like I&#39;m a slave to that lesson plans sheet. It takes me hours to<br/>\ncreate it as well. And we never deviate from it; if it&#39;s not on the list, we<br/>\ndon&#39;t do it. By the time we&#39;re done with all of the planned activites (about<br/>\nan hours&#39; worth), I need a break! So we&#39;re not playing many games, doing<br/>\npuzzles, getting out some of the great activity books we have etc. I&#39;ve been<br/>\nfeeling like I need to plan for that as well.
