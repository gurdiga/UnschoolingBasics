From what I&#39;m  <br/>\nunderstanding, the sister who doesn&#39;t like to read has  a daughter  <br/>\nwho&#39;s resisting reading. I&#39;m visualizing (and correct me if I&#39;m  <br/>\nwrong) that the mom only reads when she *has* to, and it&#39;s only the  <br/>\none book they do at bedtime? She probably never sits and reads,  <br/>\nsetting an example of loving to read, and she doesn&#39;t take her  <br/>\ndaughter to the library to find fun books that the child would be  <br/>\ninterested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say that sure, you&#39;ll tutor, drop the niece off twice a week  <br/>\n(or as often as you can). And when she&#39;s there do no teaching. Spend  <br/>\na while relaxing and letting her do what she likes with her cousin.  <br/>\nTell your sister that you&#39;re building trust first. Before she comes,  <br/>\nplan stuff with your son of fun stuff they can do....mixing edible  <br/>\nplaydough, playing dinosaurs, whatever they like. Then you can  <br/>\nintroduce things slowly, while they&#39;re mixing, say &quot;Wow, we put in  <br/>\none cup of peanut butter, one cup of honey, one cup of oatmeal, and  <br/>\none of powdered milk. I wonder how many cups of playdough we have?&quot;  <br/>\nWe double our recipe when friends come over, so how many cups of milk  <br/>\nshould we put in? When they are transitioning in play, ask if they  <br/>\nwould like a story, or be willing to sit in the corner of the room  <br/>\nreading your own book. Set lots of good instances of reading. &quot;WOW!  <br/>\nI&#39;m reading this book and it says that snakes usually lay eggs, but  <br/>\nsome species have LIVE BABIES! Can you believe it?&quot; See if there is a  <br/>\nsummer reading program, and sign the kids up. Offer to take the kids  <br/>\non that day so you can take her to a great resource.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd hey, she hasn&#39;t specified HOW to tutor, just that she wants you  <br/>\nto. I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;re in a rough spot, but I would definitely  <br/>\ntake the child JUST so you can ensure she gets a break and is in an  <br/>\nenvironment where learning is fun. And just so you know, the new  <br/>\nsummer programs are a lot more fun than what we saw as summer school.  <br/>\nJosh signed up for it just to go two summers in a row (and he is way  <br/>\nabove grade level in all topics)...and actually is going this year as  <br/>\na peer mentor even though we&#39;re unschooling and not even part of the  <br/>\ndistrict.

Sheesh.  Why can&#39;t<br/>\naverage be ok?  Why do kids feel the need to be &quot;above average?&quot;  By sending<br/>\na child to summer school and with labelling the child &quot;average&quot; (like it&#39;s a<br/>\nbad thing) the message this child is going to get is &quot;I&#39;m not good enough&quot;<br/>\nand the child will learn to hate learning.  I would be sympathetic that your<br/>\nsister is feeling stressed about this, but I don&#39;t see why you should tutor<br/>\nyour niece when you wouldn&#39;t &quot;tutor&quot; your own child.  Invite them over for<br/>\nplaydates with your son or something.  Also, half.com is an excellent<br/>\nresource for inexpensive books.  I&#39;m constantly paying more in shipping than<br/>\nI am for books LOL!  You may find a few books on there that you could<br/>\npurchase for your own library and to share with your sister.

She has an <br/>\n11yo step-son (living with her and DH), a 6yo dd and a 3mo ds.  She is <br/>\nyounger than me.  Both of her kids are attending a private Christian <br/>\nschool.  Her 6yo dd is finishing up K-5.  My sister called me the other <br/>\nday on her way to pick up the kids from school and asked me if I&#39;d tutor <br/>\nher daughter some this summer in reading and math.  Seems that my niece <br/>\nis just testing at &quot;average&quot; and the teacher is recommending that my <br/>\nniece do some work over the summer.  My sister has already signed her up <br/>\nfor 4wks of tutoring at school (sounds kind of like summer school <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s not individual tutoring and I think it&#39;s just an hour or <br/>\ntwo each week).  My mom offered me up to my sister, probably because I <br/>\nhave told them that I will be homeschooling my 5yo ds (I haven&#39;t <br/>\nmentioned unschooling to them, they&#39;re not ready for that).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in our less than 5 minute conversation, my sister told me that my <br/>\nniece is resisting her bedtime reading assignments (they have to read <br/>\nsomething before they go to bed ~ suggested by the teacher).  I <br/>\nsuggested that my sister not struggle with her on this.  I suggested <br/>\nthat my sister, her husband or her older son could read the stories <br/>\nwhile my niece looked on.  She&#39;ll still get the story, she&#39;ll still be <br/>\n&quot;learning,&quot; etc.  I also suggested that she not make this an issue with <br/>\nmy niece, especially at this young age.  I reminded my sister how much <br/>\nshe hates to read, and we don&#39;t want that to happen with my niece.  I <br/>\ntold my sister that my niece could come a long way on her own this <br/>\nsummer, without all the tutoring and workbooks, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love for my sister to read John Holt&#39;s &quot;Learning All the Time.&quot;  <br/>\nMy local library has it on hold for someone, so I don&#39;t know when it <br/>\nwill be available.  I know my sister hates to read, but at least this <br/>\nbook is an easy read and may help her understand a little more.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s kind of ironic, my niece begs my sister to homeschool her because <br/>\nshe hates getting up in the morning to go to school.  She is at the <br/>\nprime time to be unschooled.  My niece is extremely verbal, was talking <br/>\nin complete sentences by age 1.  I think unschooling would be so freeing <br/>\nfor her (and her brother too).  My sister&#39;s husband would flip his lid <br/>\nover it though.  I know he probably thinks I&#39;m a lunatic for co-sleeping <br/>\nand extended nursing, but he is softening up to it some in his older age <br/>\nand especially because they have a newborn in the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what suggestions do you wise women and men have for me?  I really <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to do &quot;school&quot; with her over the summer.  My son would love <br/>\nto have her over just to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA!<br/>\n<br/>\nKristie, the newbie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13732,"nextTopicId":13637}}
