My<br/>\nfriend said something to the effect of &quot;Maybe she&#39;ll be a writer<br/>\nwhen she grows up&quot;.<br/>\nTo which I replied, &quot;She already *is* a writer&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe paused as she thought about that, and said &quot;Yes, she is a<br/>\nwriter. What a wonderfully supportive way of looking at it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat little shift in thinking has been very helpful to me in<br/>\nunschooling my three children. What she&#39;s doing now is valid and<br/>\nimportant, not because it may help her when she becomes an adult,<br/>\nnot because she may choose that as her career, but because it brings<br/>\nher joy and makes her happy now, right now. She is not an &quot;adult in<br/>\nthe making&quot;. She&#39;s exactly where she should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo without further ado, here is Jacqueline&#39;s story. She is already<br/>\nworking on her second one, which I&#39;ll post when she&#39;d done.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrincess Barbie<br/>\nby Jacqueline Anne Akerman (a 7 year old unschooler)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I love being a princess.&quot; Said Barbie.<br/>\nBarbie&#39;s tutor came in and said &quot;Princess the queen sent for you&quot;.<br/>\n&quot;Where is she?&quot; said Barbie.<br/>\n&quot;In the throne room&quot; said Ken.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbie went to the Throne room. There the queen sat. &quot;Come my dear&quot;<br/>\nsaid the queen. Barbie hugged the queen. Barbie was surprise to see<br/>\nroyal page.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon Barbie was heading back to her room when she heard a cry. It<br/>\nwas the royal page yelling invader!<br/>\n&quot;Invader?&quot; asked the princess. &quot;Yes&quot; said the royal page. &quot;We must<br/>\nhide&quot; said royal page.<br/>\nSo they hid. The invaders lost.<br/>\nThey were safe.<br/>\nThe Royal page was nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe End.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (7), Shawna (10) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 30, 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://foreverparents.com\">http://foreverparents.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12619,"nextTopicId":12645}}
