Not because adults brains necessarily work the same way as kid brains (although there&#39;s a whole &#39;nother topic in there) but because its a much closer model to the way unschooling kids learn than the way kids in school learn. Compulsory &quot;education&quot; produces a very different learning process than natural learning - a difference that&#39;s more profound than those differences between the way a 5yos mind processes new information vs a 40yos mind, because of the effects of motivation. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136944076,"authorName":"Jenna Robertson","from":"Jenna Robertson &lt;mamamole@...&gt;","profile":"Mamamole","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:the term &#39;unschooling&#39;","postDate":"1260898477","msgId":42416,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzNjcxNS45Mzk3MS5xbUB3ZWI2NTcwMi5tYWlsLmFjNC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNTcwMWNhN2Q5ZiQ5ZDE3ZGZhMCQ4MzAwYThjMEByZWR3aW5lPg=="},"prevInTopic":42415,"nextInTopic":42418,"prevInTime":42415,"nextInTime":42417,"topicId":42408,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Andragogy is typically used to refer to the education of adults. ...       If I had influence with the good fairy who is supposed to preside over the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1989467368\">Andragogy is typically used to refer to the education of adults.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;If I had influence with the good fairy who is supposed to preside over the christening of all children, I would ask that her gift to each child in the world be a sense of wonder so indestructible that it would last throughout life.&quot; <br/>\n               - Rachel Carson <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Tue, 12/15/09, Professional Parenting &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jarnall@...\">jarnall@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Professional Parenting &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jarnall@...\">jarnall@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:the term &#39;unschooling&#39;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Tuesday, December 15, 2009, 7:59 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAndragogy?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96745299,"authorName":"Professional Parenting","from":"&quot;Professional Parenting&quot; &lt;jarnall@...&gt;","profile":"oooffca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:the term &#39;unschooling&#39;","postDate":"1260892782","msgId":42415,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNTcwMWNhN2Q5ZiQ5ZDE3ZGZhMCQ4MzAwYThjMEByZWR3aW5lPg==","referencesHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NkRFODk1QEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":42414,"nextInTopic":42416,"prevInTime":42414,"nextInTime":42416,"topicId":42408,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Andragogy? ...
