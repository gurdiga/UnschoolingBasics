People are always trying to clear away clutter, or take<br/>\n  care of something BEFORE getting to their mediation/practice.

Unlearning is the process of<br/>\n  becoming enlightened. Because you have learned wrong ways, and those<br/>\n  wrong ways are the barriers, they have to be unlearned. You are born<br/>\n  enlightened, and then you are forced into unenlightenment. You are<br/>\n  conditioned for an insance society. Then you are forced to adjust to<br/>\n  an insane society. If you remain miserable there is no wonder in it.<br/>\n  You will remain miserable because this is not your real nature. This<br/>\n  is not the flowering of your being.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think unschoolers and mindful parents are trying to skip the part <br/>\n  of their children learning &quot;wrong ways&quot; and becoming unenlightened!:)<br/>\n  We WANT our children to know themselves, for their being to flower in<br/>\n  it&#39;s own way and time.
