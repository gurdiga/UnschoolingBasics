That tells me <br/>\nthat we are pushing our kids WAY too soon to begin &quot;adademic&quot; sorts <br/>\nof things.  Just a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an 11 year old that is just beginning to learn how to read.  <br/>\nHe started, like many kids, to become interested in letters around <br/>\nage 6 or so but since then it has been a very SLOW process in <br/>\ngetting to the reading point.  School would have destroyed him!!!  <br/>\nHe has just naturally, slowly become interested in learning how to <br/>\nread.  For him, it is a jumbled, doesn&#39;t make sense, sort of thing <br/>\nand he just needed more time.  He has mostly learned how to read by <br/>\nmy sitting for HOURS and reading the screen for his Game Cube and X <br/>\nBox games.  Sometimes it can get frustrating but I know that is what <br/>\nhe needs so I do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is just beginning to read street signs and store front signs.  <br/>\nThe other day he asked &quot;What is Grat Clips?&quot;  It took me a while of <br/>\nlooking around to figure out that he was looking at the Great Clips <br/>\n(haircutting place) sign.  So he is slowly getting there.  He has <br/>\ngotten there in his own way and without anyone shaming him because <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t know how to read.  I never worried because I knew he <br/>\nwould get there (thanks Jared for paving the way).  Jared is Ren&#39;s <br/>\nson that didn&#39;t learn to read until age 12.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing that I did do though was to protect my son from anyone <br/>\nthat might try and shame him.  If he got a card I would be standing <br/>\nright there reading it for him, pretending to read it to myself.  If <br/>\nhe wanted to go to Sunday school I made sure I taught his class.  I <br/>\nam always on the guard for situations that open him up for teasing <br/>\nor any kind of shame from public school kids.  Meanwhile, he is <br/>\nhappily doing the things that are relevant to him and that bring him <br/>\njoy!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi Snavley</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6157,"nextTopicId":16513}}
