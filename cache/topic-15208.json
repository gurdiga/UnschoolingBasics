We all have tapes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s important not to beat ourselves up for our slip ups. I  <br/>\nthink it&#39;s important to divorce our sense of value as people from  <br/>\nmistakes or even choices we made. Our sense of value should come from  <br/>\ntrying to be better than trying to be right.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in order to try to make better choices, we need a clear vision of  <br/>\nwhere we&#39;re trying to get to. And that&#39;s what the list is about.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut no one need to go the whole way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is not a simple journey and I think some of the visitors to  <br/>\n&gt; this list<br/>\n&gt; are less than enthusiastic because it is difficult to examine one&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; self and<br/>\n&gt; admit that changes need to be made.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely. Often we make choices because they&#39;re convenient for  <br/>\nourselves. They make life easier at the expense of other people. It&#39;s  <br/>\neasier to make kids do chores than to do it all yourself. (Or in  <br/>\ntheory anyway! The tension of reminding and punishing and talking and  <br/>\nwhatever other energy parents pour into getting others to do chores  <br/>\nisn&#39;t inconsequential!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf something feels like it&#39;s working, there isn&#39;t any reason to  <br/>\nchange. But many people read and find their persepctive starts  <br/>\nshifting and they see what seemed so calm and smooth before doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nseem that way from their kids points of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sometimes people find conventional  parenting techniques work.  <br/>\nThey *think* their kids are kind and helpful and thoughtful *because*  <br/>\nof conventional parenting. But if that were true, all conventionally  <br/>\nparenting kids would be kind and helpful and thoughtful. Quite the  <br/>\nopposite is true. So it&#39;s something else that&#39;s counteracting the  <br/>\nconventional parenting. They just aren&#39;t able to see or explain what  <br/>\nit is they&#39;re doing. It might be some naturally respectful way  <br/>\nthey&#39;re talking that they grew up with. But it&#39;s the respect that&#39;s  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s working. Offering chores as a valid way of getting the house  <br/>\nclean is not going to turn all kids into happy volunteer helpers ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Where are you ladies hiding the magic unschooling pills?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They&#39;re handed out at the conferences ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for all the time you spend sharing your amazing wisdom.   <br/>\n&gt; It really<br/>\n&gt; is working for us.
