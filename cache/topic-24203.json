I am a single parent and I just felt that I could collect others&#39; opinions and then choose what felt right.  Also, I am interested in being a good listener and making people feel heard.  That sounds good but I inadvertently gave the impression that I was totally insecure about how to parent.  There is a big difference between being open/respectful to hearing others opinions and being unsure of one&#39;s own!   So I wonder if maybe you seem unsure to the neighbors?   I have come to believe in a confident but close-mouthed approach:  &quot;We homeschool because we love to be together, and it works well for us.&quot;  No apparent waffling.  No apologies, no acting like they have any right to question or be concerned, just an opaque smile.   What you alluded to about Laura&#39;s mind-pollution (are her thighs too big!!!) is only the tip of the iceberg.  By the way,<br/>\n compulsory education doesn&#39;t start until age 7 in Montana.  What is the age for yor state?  What&#39;s the rush?   I am thinking of a Peanuts cartoon in our paper last week.  In it, Charlie Brown asks his little sister Sally how she gets all A&#39;s in school. Her answer is &quot;I am on time, I go where I am told, I do what I am told, and I color in the lines.&quot;  Well, of course that is close to true.  Is that what will be best for Laura?  Oops, let me just fall off my soapbox!

We live in a district that is <br/>\nconsidered to be the &quot;best&quot; in our state but, of course, you have to <br/>\nask, &quot;best&quot; compared to what! So I understand several of the <br/>\nreactions you are up against. I often find that people are busy <br/>\ndefending their own choice to send their kids to school vs. actually <br/>\nasking about home schooling. I usually tell people that we home <br/>\nschool and leave it at that. If people seem genuinely curious then <br/>\nI&#39;m willing to divulge more but mostly I&#39;ve decided not to invite <br/>\ncriticism or comments that I don&#39;t want. And I generally don&#39;t use <br/>\nthe word unschooling--I use some mumbo jumbo about child-led <br/>\nlearning when people ask about curriculum. Again, if I get into a <br/>\nconversation that is truly motivated by interest, then I&#39;m willing <br/>\nto start talking unschooling and what I&#39;ve learned about how people <br/>\nlearn. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also generally give vague reasons why we made this choice--&quot;the <br/>\nmainstream classroom wasnt&#39; a good fit for our child,&quot; &quot;regular <br/>\nschooling wasn&#39;t a good choice for our family,&quot; etc. As many people, <br/>\nI have a litany of detailed complaints about what made school not <br/>\nwork for our family, but I save those for the genuinely interested. <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel thrilled with our decision so it&#39;s not a matter of protecting <br/>\nmy position lest it crumble. I just feel like it&#39;s not people&#39;s <br/>\nbusiness to comment on it and so I choose to protect my self and my <br/>\nkids from what I often find are insensitive and uneducated <br/>\n(regarding homeshooling) comments. I&#39;m willing to &quot;educate&quot; those <br/>\nwho want to know but it&#39;s wasted breath when all the other person <br/>\nwants to believe is that you are wrong.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe it&#39;s just worry about two guys screwing it up or do all of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>you <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; get it from your neighbors too?

It is hard <br/>\nto step off the mainstream path, as you well know. I often wonder <br/>\nexactly when I stepped off the path! I think about getting one of <br/>\nthose bumper stickers that says, &quot;Why be normal?&quot; I&#39;ve seen people <br/>\nput them on upside down.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been helpful for me to find like-minded souls thru local <br/>\nhomeschooling groups. When I can hang and converse with them, I am <br/>\nreminded that we&#39;re really not so weird!<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there!

When he <br/>\napproached 5 and we said &quot;We plan to homeschool&quot;, it was kind of <br/>\ncasual and since we were out and about and he was bouncing merrily <br/>\naround, it was fine. Also in the mix, state law allows for a &#39;waiver&#39; <br/>\nto keep kids home an extra year or two before compulsory attendance <br/>\n(if you plan to send your kids to school but want to give them some <br/>\nextra time, you can legally keep them home until they are turning 7). <br/>\nSo, 5 and 6 are somewhat optional, though common.

Both sets of family (mine and <br/>\nILs) are firmly on board with whatever it is we&#39;re doing - they may <br/>\nnot understand it totally but they can see the results - a happy, <br/>\ngrowing, curious, confident kid who is interested and interesting. My <br/>\ndad has even taken to sending the random articles that have appeared <br/>\nin various newspapers about unschooling - after reading one such <br/>\narticle he said &quot;this sounds like what you are doing. looks pretty <br/>\ninteresting.&quot; and we went on to a long discussion about what he sees <br/>\nhappening with his other grandkids and school and schedules and <br/>\ntesting and all like that (all the grandkids in question are between <br/>\nages 6 and 10, DS is 9).<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7644358,"authorName":"Kidgie@aol.com","from":"Kidgie@...","profile":"mama_de_julian_y_julia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] How do you handle it?","postDate":"1181243285","msgId":24222,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM0OS4xMWZmNDcwOC4zMzk5YjE5NUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24219,"nextInTopic":24224,"prevInTime":24221,"nextInTime":24223,"topicId":24203,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/7/2007 12:01:57 P.M.

Thanks for your concern.&quot; And move on to a different topic. Lather,  <br/>\nrinse, repeat, lol, if need be. You can also take the  <br/>\nlet-me-help-educate-you-about-homeschooling route, by mentioning that the winner  of the national <br/>\nspelling bee is a homeschooler, that homeschooling is gaining  popularity and <br/>\nyou feel it&#39;s a sound alternative to traditional education, cite  websites, <br/>\nbooks and what-not that have shown what a wonderful and  well rounded approach to <br/>\nlearning this is. Basically, I have found  then when I am quizzed by strangers <br/>\nor others, I can just begin to babble on and  on and they become quite <br/>\ngape-mouthed, lol, and realize they started me on one  of my passions and <br/>\ntangents...lol...they drift off, eventually :) <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s tough to go against the grain. Do you have any meetings or groups with  <br/>\nother homeschoolers? I have 2 I go to regularly, and that really helps me. I <br/>\nget  support, like-minded parents, ideas - my kids have friends, playmates and  <br/>\nregular activities (we just joined a homeschoolers bowling league, yahoo! <br/>\nlol!).  But without these groups, I&#39;d be quite alone. I need that one on one <br/>\nsupport.  Any chance you&#39;re in Southern CA? <br/>\n <br/>\nTake care and good luck.
