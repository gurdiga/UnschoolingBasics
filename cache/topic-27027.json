It <br/>\n&gt; might be better to focus on the feelings/cues of the other people in <br/>\n&gt; the room without any reference to who&#39;s standing where and why. So <br/>\n&gt; maybe you could say &quot;so-and-so didn&#39;t seem to like being pushed very <br/>\n&gt; much - what would help you remember not to push?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n(Vicki) Absolutely!  Our discussions always are first about the other<br/>\nchild&#39;s feelings.   Feelings have always been our focus and I guess I<br/>\nshould of expressed that in the post.  One thing we have always talked<br/>\nabout is &quot;would you like it if so-and-so pushed you or jumped in front<br/>\nof you in line?&quot;  I always get the answer &quot;NO&quot; loud and clear.  Then<br/>\nwe talk about what he did to that person and he thinks about it and<br/>\nthen defends himself by saying &quot;but they were taking too long or they<br/>\nare in my way&quot;  Which brings me back to we are all different and we<br/>\nmove in different ways and sometimes it can be frustrating to us if<br/>\nthings don&#39;t happen the way you want but remember,  you will get a<br/>\nturn.  This is his third session of these 10 week session of<br/>\ngymnastics and this behavior has just cropped up in the last few<br/>\nweeks.  It seems to me he has went through another developmental phase<br/>\nas he&#39;s grown in height and suddenly his interests have changed.  For<br/>\nexample,  he had no interest before in the alphabet.  Now he&#39;s learned<br/>\nall of his letters in no time and is actually trying to read.  It&#39;s<br/>\nlike he can&#39;t get enough of alphabet stimulation.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;(Meredith) Were you in the room?  <br/>\n(Vicki)YES,  but it&#39;s a huge gymnasium and I was not next to him. This<br/>\nis not a parent/child class.  This is a child class and parents can be<br/>\nin the gymnasium watching from the side lines.  I watch him throughout<br/>\nthe class.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Meredith)&gt; We use &quot;stop&quot; as our &quot;safe word&quot; as it were,  and I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen known to say something like: &quot;I heard a &quot;stop&quot;<br/>\n&gt; or &quot;Ouch means stop&quot; or (my personal favorite) &quot;Stop means Stop!&quot; I <br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t leave something like that up to a teacher or worse, a group <br/>\n&gt; of little kids, I&#39;d say something myself, *especially* to my own <br/>\n&gt; child! <br/>\n<br/>\n (vicki)Oh my Meredith,  I wouldn&#39;t dream of leaving something like<br/>\nthat to a group of little kids.  Hmmm,  I must present myself better<br/>\nin posts if that is what you understood!!  That&#39;s a very scary<br/>\nthought!  I also wouldn&#39;t leave it to the instructor.  You are right,<br/>\n this is my child!  Of course I said something immediately,  but he<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t hear me as I was across the gymnasium.  As soon as he was<br/>\nclose enough I talked with him.    When I have observed him leaning on<br/>\nsome one while sitting there I have got his attention.    Shook my<br/>\nhead no.  He stopped immediately.  Sadly,  this was one of those<br/>\nsituations where I just couldn&#39;t get his attention quick enough.   I<br/>\nshould also detail again that behavior in line is something relatively<br/>\nnew. So I want to nip it in the bud quickly as I don&#39;t want a bully!! <br/>\n <br/>\nIts this kind of situation exactly that led me to <br/>\n&gt; homeschooling in the first place - some kids need a whole lot more <br/>\n&gt; feedback and support in groups than others and its unkind to <br/>\n&gt; everyone, including the &quot;bullying&quot; child, to withhold that support. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain Meredith.  You are absolutely right!  I am not a parent that<br/>\nthrows my child out there and doesn&#39;t pay attention to what&#39;s going<br/>\non. I know he needs my feedback often.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion I think there are &quot;hands-on parents&quot; and there are<br/>\n&quot;hands-off&quot;.  We are totally hands-on and I do want to help guide my<br/>\nson to peaceful play,  kind and gentleness towards others,  think of<br/>\nothers feelings.  At the same time I want to honor the fact that he&#39;s<br/>\nstrong and wants to lead.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m thinking one way to help him is outlets that let him be rough<br/>\nand tumble. Like hockey if he likes it.  Empathy discussions when<br/>\nneeded.

Let me state he loves gymnastics. He can&#39;t<br/>\nwait to get there each week. We&#39;ve talked about how everyone gets<br/>\ntheir &quot;turn&quot; to do each piece of equipment etc. I have also noticed<br/>\nthe instructor being aware of this and will often pick the children<br/>\nout of the line in not a consistent order. So if ds is in front the<br/>\ninstructor may pick a child from the middle or end. So my ds and I<br/>\nhave talked about how would he like it if another child pushed him to<br/>\nget in a particular spot etc. When they are sitting I&#39;ve noticed he<br/>\nwill lean on the person next to him till they move. We&#39;ve talked<br/>\nabout how pushing another person isn&#39;t kind and that person could get<br/>\nhurt. At the end of class this week, I saw him push this little girl<br/>\ntwice who was in front of him. When he came to me after class. I<br/>\nasked if he had fun and he was excited and said yes. We basked a<br/>\nlittle in his excitement. As we talked about what they did in class I<br/>\ntold him I had seen him push this little girl. I asked him why did<br/>\nhe push her. His answer was, &quot;she&#39;s moving too slow and was in my<br/>\nway. I wanted to be first in line.&quot; In our discussion we talked<br/>\nabout how gymnastics class is set up by children getting into line to<br/>\nmove from each different exercise. It really doesn&#39;t matter where you<br/>\nare in that line as each person gets an equal turn on the equipment. <br/>\nWe also talked about how the instructor choses the kids randomly from<br/>\nthe line so placement doesn&#39;t really matter. We also talked about he<br/>\ncould of really hurt this little girl by pushing her. She also asked<br/>\nhim to stop the first time he pushed her. He did it again and she<br/>\nasked him to stop. Then she told the instructor what he did. Again<br/>\nwe talked about it, if he was in line and the person behind him pushed<br/>\nhim and he asked to not be pushed, how would of he felt if the person<br/>\npushed him again. He said he wouldn&#39;t like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts out there? We are talking about it but I often read such<br/>\ngreat things from many of you on the list.

We are unschooling and mom (me) works each<br/>\nday to deschool myself in thoughts of education and parenting!  I<br/>\nthink I&#39;m getting it but I know I can slip up from time to time when<br/>\nI&#39;m tired and exhausted.  Our ds has lead us to unschooling.  I&#39;m so<br/>\nglad he did! <br/>\n<br/>\nMy ds is high energy,  loves to run, bounce, climb and have fun.  He<br/>\nalso likes things his way and has even so much told me recently,  &quot;I<br/>\nwant to do this or that my way and I know what I want&quot;.  Great!  No<br/>\ntrouble having to guess what he wants at that time.  However, it can<br/>\nmake play dates difficult from time to time.  Other children may not<br/>\nwant to necessarily play his way.  KWIM. ;) My real concern is,  I<br/>\nhave observed him in his gymnastics class being pushy to the other<br/>\nkids to get the exact place he wants to be in line or sitting waiting<br/>\nfor the next exercise.  Let me state he loves gymnastics.  He can&#39;t<br/>\nwait to get there each week.   We&#39;ve talked about how everyone gets<br/>\ntheir &quot;turn&quot; to do each piece of equipment etc.  I have also noticed<br/>\nthe instructor being aware of this and will often pick the children<br/>\nout of the line in not a consistent order.  So if ds is in front the<br/>\ninstructor may pick a child from the middle or end.  So my ds and I<br/>\nhave talked about how would he like it if another child pushed him to<br/>\nget in a particular spot etc. When they are sitting I&#39;ve noticed he<br/>\nwill lean on the person next to him till they move.  We&#39;ve talked<br/>\nabout how pushing another person isn&#39;t kind and that person could get<br/>\nhurt. At the end of class this week,  I saw him push this little girl<br/>\ntwice who was in front of him.  When he came to me after class.  I<br/>\nasked if he had fun and he was excited and said yes.  We basked a<br/>\nlittle in his excitement.  As we talked about what they did in class I<br/>\ntold him I had seen him push this little girl.   I asked him why did<br/>\nhe push her.   His answer was,  &quot;she&#39;s moving too slow and was in my<br/>\nway.  I wanted to be first in line.&quot;   In our discussion we talked<br/>\nabout how gymnastics class is set up by children getting into line to<br/>\nmove from each different exercise.  It really doesn&#39;t matter where you<br/>\nare in that line as each person gets an equal turn on the equipment. <br/>\nWe also talked about how the instructor choses the kids randomly from<br/>\nthe line so placement doesn&#39;t really matter.  We also talked about he<br/>\ncould of really hurt this little girl by pushing her.  She also asked<br/>\nhim to stop the first time he pushed her.  He did it again and she<br/>\nasked him to stop. Then she told the instructor what he did.   Again<br/>\nwe talked about it, if he was in line and the person behind him pushed<br/>\nhim and he asked to not be pushed, how would of he felt if the person<br/>\npushed him again.  He said he wouldn&#39;t like that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts out there?  We are talking about it but I often read such<br/>\ngreat things from many of you on the list.  I&#39;m always open for<br/>\ndifferent perspectives and always, always learning!  I&#39;ve got my<br/>\nnewspaper rolled up and ready to whack myself on the head at any given<br/>\ntime.  LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your advice.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27057,"nextTopicId":27076}}
