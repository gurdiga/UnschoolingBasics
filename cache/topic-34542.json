Let&#39;s see if together we can come up with  <br/>\nsome ideas.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, TRY their ideas - even the farfetched ones. I remember I was  <br/>\nreally sick once and told my daughters I needed them to do something  <br/>\nsafe and quiet while I rested. My little one decided that she should  <br/>\nsing to me and rub my back. So, I didn&#39;t get a break from the kids,  <br/>\nbut, still, what a sweet gift!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, you might be surprised - once you&#39;ve brainstormed some ideas,  <br/>\ntoss the idea out that they might all go into their bedrooms and set a  <br/>\ntimer for one hour so that you can have one uninterrupted hour of rest  <br/>\ntime every day. Maybe brainstorm a list of things they could do during  <br/>\nthat time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea is to get a mother&#39;s helper - someone who comes every day  <br/>\nfor an hour or two and THEY facilitate the kids while you go take a  <br/>\nnap or a bath or go for a walk or read a book or whatever will help you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOR - maybe someone to clean house for you - a teenage kid who won&#39;t  <br/>\ncharge you much, and who will clean up clutter, not just do actual  <br/>\ncleaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote something, somewhere, about getting mini-vacations throughout  <br/>\nthe day. I&#39;m going to go look for that and post it because it sounds  <br/>\nlike you really really need it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Question about time","postDate":"1216228444","msgId":34545,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQUI1N0U3QkMxOUU3Qi0xNkQ0LTEzQ0JAV0VCTUFJTC1EQjEzLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGQwZGQzNGUzMDgwNzE2MDkxNmkxNDAyMDJlMGs0ZGEzMDg0NTA4NzE5ZDE2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGQwZGQzNGUzMDgwNzE2MDkxNmkxNDAyMDJlMGs0ZGEzMDg0NTA4NzE5ZDE2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34544,"nextInTopic":34547,"prevInTime":34544,"nextInTime":34546,"topicId":34542,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
