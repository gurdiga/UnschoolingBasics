You can easily separate colors and/or mix.  Clean up?  Rinse and reuse or throw away.  <br/>\n <br/>\n- Cheap paint:  flour, water, and food coloring.  <br/>\n <br/>\n- we like Lakeshore Learning paint (pretty reliable for no stains so far!!).  If you get a catalogue, it can also stand in for inspiration for other projects.  They have the &quot;no spill&quot; cups you spoke of too, and brushes.  <br/>\n <br/>\n- paper:  go to Target (or the dollar store too!!) and get the brown paper you&#39;d see paper grocery bags made of.  It&#39;s cheap -- about $3 for a *big* roll here, I think.  Tape it to a washable floor and let your artist have at it!!!  <br/>\n <br/>\n- for easy clean up, use an old shower curtain as a base.  When the artist is finished, you can take it outside and hose it down!!  <br/>\n <br/>\n- you can also use old tooth brushes, tooth picks (safety...), cotton swabs, sponges (buy whole and cut yourself or have the artist cut it!!), cut vegetables or fruit (pepper, apple, potatoes, etc.), or a myriad of other things!!  <br/>\n <br/>\n- if you buy paint, be sure to get black and white as well.  We like the way they lighten and darken colors!!  <br/>\n <br/>\nHope that helps!!  <br/>\n <br/>\nJane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn &lt;dezigna@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;loves to paint.

I&#39;ve never used them for my kids, but they have mostly all taken showers ever since they could stand.  We have played with the Crayola &quot;no mess&quot; paints before and they do work!  The paint will only paint on the special paper. It won&#39;t paint on clothes, skin, furniture, walls, etc.  Another option is some tempura paints and cover the kitchen table with white butcher paper (or even the back of old wrapping paper) and let him go to town making huge paintings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I learned very early when painting with tempura or poster paints is to give each color its own brush.  That way the child doesn&#39;t have to worry about rinsing the brush out, paint colors don&#39;t get mixed and the paints last longer (because they don&#39;t get watery or mixed to that horrible shade of greenish-gray!)  Find decent paint brushes as school supply stores.  They really are worth the extra money.  Those plastic flimsy paintbrushes that they sell fall apart so easily and are very frustrating for budding artists.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":145604420,"authorName":"Cheryl Morkan","from":"&quot;Cheryl Morkan&quot; &lt;Luckiebyrd@...&gt;","profile":"luckiebyrd2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Paints","postDate":"1101774043","msgId":4181,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNvZ2Vjcis1Y2ZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4183,"prevInTime":4180,"nextInTime":4182,"topicId":4181,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone.
