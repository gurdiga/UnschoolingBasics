For example, he&#39;ll want to walk &quot;all by himself&quot; but we&#39;re in a <br/>\nparking lot that is a little busier so I&#39;ll ask him to stay close or hold on <br/>\nto the cart or hold my hand, etc., and from experience I know that he&#39;ll <br/>\nwant to &quot;push&quot; back when I do that so he darts away. Now I&#39;m trying to do <br/>\nthings differently like just giving him a reminder that &quot;we&#39;re in a busy <br/>\nparking lot&quot; when  we&#39;re getting out of the car and he&#39;ll automatically hold <br/>\nmy hand (I don&#39;t even have to ask!). On the occasions when he doesn&#39;t hold <br/>\nmy hand and just wants to walk by himself I&#39;ll just stick very close behind <br/>\nhim or will walk extra briskly so that I can catch him if a car is coming.<br/>\n<br/>\n**In your situation in the store I would have done what you did in reminding <br/>\nhim that the store was very busy and you didn&#39;t want to lose contact with <br/>\nhim. I don&#39;t know how big the store is but maybe it was a place where you <br/>\ncould have done like a &quot;Marco Polo&quot; sort of thing as you walked down <br/>\nseparate aisles so you could keep audible track of each other (I&#39;m only <br/>\npicturing 2 aisles close by each other so maybe this wasn&#39;t possible). If it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t possible, maybe I would have simply said &quot;it&#39;s very important to me <br/>\nthat you are safe and in this big busy store, and separating from you just <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be safe so I&#39;ll stay near you&quot;. If he darted away like he did, I <br/>\nwould have run after him or at least walked quickly behind him because he <br/>\nmay want to run but it&#39;s my responsibility to keep his environment safe for <br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How would the unschooling parent handle this?  I picked him up,<br/>\n&gt;leaving the soccer ball behind and we left the store.  When we got<br/>\n&gt;home I put him in his room and when I had calmed down,  I asked him<br/>\n&gt;to tell me what he had done wrong and why it was wrong. He told me<br/>\n&gt;running away and hiding and he knew that it scared me and that he<br/>\n&gt;was supposed to stay with me because it wasn&#39;t safe for him to go<br/>\n&gt;off alone in a store. I also told him that he would have to just use<br/>\n&gt;his old soccer ball for soccer this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In this case, you&#39;re using punishment which I don&#39;t think works. It also <br/>\nseems a bit excessive (no new ball for a YEAR? that&#39;s a lifetime for a <br/>\nchild). I would have still gotten the ball because it&#39;s what you went there <br/>\nfor. Not getting it is kind of wiping away all the good memory of the fun <br/>\ntrip to the store (in my opinion). I also would not have &quot;put him in his <br/>\nroom&quot; because maybe he was still a bit scared after being separated from you <br/>\nand found by a store employee. Maybe he is the type of kid who needed to be <br/>\nwith you to feel better once you were home. Finally, I think that asking him <br/>\n&quot;what he had done wrong and why it was wrong&quot; is just making him feel even <br/>\nworse about the whole situation. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem to explain how <br/>\nworried you were when you were separated and maybe talk about ways that you <br/>\ncan be sure to stick together in the future but having him rehash the &quot;bad&quot; <br/>\nstuff he did isn&#39;t going to make him feel better or help him learn from this <br/>\nexperience.

I&#39;ve many times had an<br/>\nindependent child want to do something &quot;on their own&quot; and been in the<br/>\ndistant background where I could still see them, yet they had the<br/>\nbelief that they were independent.  going to the bathroom was a big<br/>\none for me, especially when I had a son who didn&#39;t want to go into the<br/>\n&quot;girl&quot; bathroom anymore.  I remember my trepidation at letting my son<br/>\ngo to the bathroom alone the first time at Disney when his father<br/>\nwasn&#39;t with us to &quot;go too.&quot;  Even though I could see the bathroom door<br/>\nfrom where I stood and watched it like a hawk, I still was<br/>\napprehensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we still make decisions with that former non-unschooling<br/>\nmind and we need to step back and ask ourselves for a minute &quot;how<br/>\nwould an unschooler handle this?&quot;  (I&#39;ve heard it called on this list,<br/>\n&quot;WWRenD&quot; or &quot;WWRueD&quot; or &quot;WWKellyD&quot;).  It&#39;s ok to tell your child,<br/>\n&quot;Give me a minute to think this through&quot; or &quot;Help me think this<br/>\nthrough so we have a plan!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":239865039,"authorName":"luvbnhomex3boys","from":"&quot;luvbnhomex3boys&quot; &lt;caples3562@...&gt;","profile":"luvbnhomex3boys","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Totally new to unschooling and asking for advice","postDate":"1156633531","msgId":16802,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVjcWszcitqb2Y0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16805,"prevInTime":16801,"nextInTime":16803,"topicId":16802,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone!

I think I understand the <br/>\neducational side of unschooling and am seeing my DS start to become <br/>\nmuch more curious and even wanting to learn more.  But the parenting <br/>\npart is what I am having trouble grasping.  Here is my example:  <br/>\nToday DS5 (almost 6) went shopping for a new soccer ball before his <br/>\nfirst practice.  He was very excited and we had a good time while he <br/>\npicked out the one he wanted.  Then it was time to go to the <br/>\nregister and pay.  I started to go one way and he started to go back <br/>\nthe way we had came.  So, I turned around and started following him. <br/>\nHe got upset because he wanted us each to go a different way and <br/>\nmeet at the registers. I told him we could go either way, but we had <br/>\nto go together because it was a big store and it was very busy <br/>\ntoday. He then takes off running toward the register and I just <br/>\nwalked to them, thinking he would be waiting in one of the lines <br/>\nwhen I got there, But he wasn&#39;t.  I calmly (at least on the outside) <br/>\nlooked at my watch and walked up and down and around the registers <br/>\nfor 5 minutes.  Then I asked a cashier to help me find him.  Using <br/>\nher walkie talkie another worker found him under a display.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow would the unschooling parent handle this?  I picked him up, <br/>\nleaving the soccer ball behind and we left the store.  When we got <br/>\nhome I put him in his room and when I had calmed down,  I asked him <br/>\nto tell me what he had done wrong and why it was wrong. He told me <br/>\nrunning away and hiding and he knew that it scared me and that he <br/>\nwas supposed to stay with me because it wasn&#39;t safe for him to go <br/>\noff alone in a store. I also told him that he would have to just use <br/>\nhis old soccer ball for soccer this year.  How do you handle times <br/>\nwhen they just need to do what you say?  I really feel like this was <br/>\na safety issue and wanted some opinions on how you would have <br/>\nhandled this.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16911,"nextTopicId":16918}}
