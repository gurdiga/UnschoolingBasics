I also mentioned <br/>\nsomething about seeking counseling with Naomi Aldort or Jan Hunt.  I <br/>\nhope you didn&#39;t think that I was recommending you go on any <br/>\nmedication.  I do not think that is the case, nor would I ever <br/>\nassume to make that kind of recommendation on such a forum.  An over <br/>\nthe phone session with Naomi or Jan would not lead you in that <br/>\ndirection either.  In fact, I would actually recommend &quot;against&quot; <br/>\nseeking &quot;just any old&quot; counseling, not only because they might just <br/>\ntry to give you a quick fix by putting you on medication, but also <br/>\nit is very hard to find someone who understands certain alternative <br/>\nlife choices.  I have talked to Jan on numerous occasions and she <br/>\nhas helped me through some rough spots.  It does seem to me you have <br/>\nhad more than your fair share of lifes challenges.  I hope you find <br/>\nsome support and comfort.  You really seem to have your head in the <br/>\nright place as far as I can see, it just seems you are in dire need <br/>\nof some good support and a few less curve balls thrown your way.  <br/>\nPeace and Light to you.

I am an Army wife, my <br/>\nhusband was in Iraq and I was alone with my daughter and pregnant for <br/>\nthe second time with a surrogate baby. The timeing was horrible, who <br/>\nwould have guessed we would go to war? My health, there is very <br/>\nlittle I can do that I have no already done to help it. It is just a <br/>\nwiating game on the Drs. Who by the way think they know why my throat <br/>\nfeels like it is closing every so often and why I throw up so often <br/>\nfor weeks and then it goes away, just to come back, it is not my <br/>\nthyriod after all, my a problem with acid in my stomack eating my <br/>\nthroat. I go for an upper GI and other tests next week. And as for my <br/>\nlove for helping people who in the end effect my family negatively, I <br/>\nam working on that. <br/>\n<br/>\n That is part of unschooling I think because of why I do it. I do it <br/>\nbecause like many I was programmed to only find self worth in the <br/>\nopinions of others. I want to make others happy. Working on that just <br/>\nas surely as I am working on letting my own child be who she is love <br/>\nwhat she loves. <br/>\n<br/>\n  So worry if you will, I do not depend on my child for my emotional <br/>\nhealth, I just now notice more often the wonderful things she does, <br/>\nand I take the time to enjoy it. I have a new Dr and with the files <br/>\nfrom all the others, this one agrees as well that I have sutational <br/>\ndepression and right now she said all I need is a good a friend. Only <br/>\nproblem is, that my friends are dependent on me for things and I just <br/>\ncan not count on them, so I came here to vent because one of my <br/>\nbiggest problems is trying to let go of all the schooling so that my <br/>\ndaughter can grow up happy and so that I can learn to change to make <br/>\nsure that happens. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I am very thrilled to have been given the http://www.aldort.com/ <br/>\npage because right at the top is what, says what I am looking for: <br/>\nRaising our Children, Raising ourselves. <br/>\n<br/>\n One last thing, it is not a shock to me to here people talk about <br/>\ngetting help, but often they mean medication, and that is very sick <br/>\nto me as I see it so often. People are told to not show their <br/>\nemotions and that is the sickness to me. I came here very honest <br/>\nabout how I am feeling and what is going on, looking for advice on <br/>\nhow to fix things, and it seems, though I could be wrong, that many <br/>\nhere would rather me be on medication so I am not honest about my <br/>\nfeeling for I would not even be feeling them. I can not change how <br/>\nany of those people feel about me. Most of those people also seem to <br/>\nforget that most of the brightest inventors and amazing artist and <br/>\nwriters where all full of passion and where often called crazy as <br/>\nwell.

I know my 4 five year old lives with a <br/>\nlot of passion.... <br/>\n<br/>\n  I would not change any of it. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I can just hope to change the future. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Blessings,<br/>\n  Kimmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; <br/>\n&lt;dezigna@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;So in short she is not talking to me. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I am leaving it all up to hubby now.
