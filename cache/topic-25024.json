Many shelters have programs to match pets <br/>\nwith families - it saves on returns :( My aunty is part of a kitty <br/>\nrehab program, where she takes in cats who have been thrown out <br/>\nrather than brought to a shelter and are a bit stressed-out as a <br/>\nresult. She keeps them until they are ready to go to a home. <br/>\nNaturally she can then give lots of useful information about the <br/>\ncats&#39; personalities and temperaments and quirks. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople often get rid of animals for reasons that seem strange or <br/>\ncruel - my mom took my brother&#39;s dog to the shelter when he went to <br/>\ncollege! Its by no means the case that animals in shelters are <br/>\nsomehow defective.

My DD is also very sweet and <br/>\nkind. But she is a kid. She accidently hits, kicks or headbutts me all <br/>\nthe time. We got a kitten at age 2. Here a year later I really regret <br/>\nit. She is just too rough with him, just like she is with me. Just <br/>\ntonight I was having to explain once again that when the cat is yowling <br/>\nhe is not happy and she needs to stop doing what she is doing. (as in <br/>\npulling his tail) I often feel like I have to defend the poor cat. <br/>\nAlso, he is not the nicest cat, and I think that is partly because he <br/>\nhas not been handled gently. <br/>\n   I was also trying to get you to think about the cat. Of course no <br/>\none wants to see your DD hurt, and no one wants to see a cat hurt <br/>\neither, but it kind of goes beyond that even.  Quite honestly the cat <br/>\nprobably can&#39;t kill her. While if she is too rough with the cat she <br/>\ncould actaully kill him. Not intentionally of course! But I have seen <br/>\nmy DD do some things that if we let her continue, could have easily <br/>\nkilled the cat. <br/>\n   One other thing I don&#39;t think has been mentioned is you have another <br/>\nchild to think about too. WHat about your son, and him getting hurt or <br/>\nhurting the cat? Several people are saying that 4 is too young for a <br/>\nkitten, what about your 1 1/2 y.o.? Your DD and if she thinks she is <br/>\nbeing rewarded for bad behavior is just a small part of this decision. <br/>\n   Anyway, for me, if I had a do over, I would not have gotten a kitten <br/>\nat the point we did, and probably would not now either. Of course the <br/>\nright age would depend on each individual child, <br/>\n<br/>\nElody</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185132076,"authorName":"yahoo@jetsoncity.com","from":"yahoo@...","profile":"tiggeret866","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"cats and kids  was: Please help me get out of this mainstream thinking!","postDate":"1184881497","msgId":25058,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyMTEwNDY2NjQ4LjIwMDcwNzE5MTc0NDU3QGpldHNvbmNpdHkuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwODkwMWM3Y2EzYyQxMjVjZjk0MCRmYjhhZGNjY0BPZmZpY2U+","referencesHeader":"PGY3bzJ2Mytsb3Y4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDA4OTAxYzdjYTNjJDEyNWNmOTQwJGZiOGFkY2NjQE9mZmljZT4="},"prevInTopic":25052,"nextInTopic":25061,"prevInTime":25057,"nextInTime":25059,"topicId":25024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i only read the first few replies to the thread... i also have that thinking going that that they will think that the reward will make them think the bad","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1372239045\">i only read the first few replies to the thread...<br/>\n<br/>\ni also have that thinking going that that they will think that the &quot;reward&quot; will make them think the bad behavior is what is being rewarded... my husband helps me get through those &quot;thoughts&quot;... i have found that the act of kindness will spill over on the kids. so if zoe is being extra grumpy or mean and i give her a &quot;gift&quot; of extra time or i&#39;ll pull out a craft( her favorite activity) she will get happy and be nice to tommy or get over her grumpiness... also i look at her diet. if she has been fed by my parents, that you usually puts both kids in a bad mood. they dont read labels and buy just about everything with HFCS and PHO... so the kids get wacky. <br/>\n<br/>\ni think the kids dont have that thinking about &quot;rewards&quot;. its something that grown-ups put in their head.<br/>\n<br/>\nnow about the kitten...<br/>\n<br/>\nwe first got two sphynx kittens when zoe was 2. we bought from a bad breeder and they both died within the month. about 4 days after getting the two kittens we got another sphynx from a non breeder. (we were going to start a cattery).. so we were left with one kitten. zoe LOVED her. there was a fair amount of not playing gentle, but the sphynx breed is very kind. we had tommy shortly after. tommy grew up with a cat. the cat got pregnant... she made a hole in the screen and got out. we had four kittens. two went to a friend and two stayed with us. while the kittens were getting old enough to move to their new home with 3 girls, the kids &quot;broke them in&quot;. they were the best kitties we have ever had. i had 6 cats in ohio before having kids... my parents moved in and my dad hates cats... the kitties mysteriously disappeared... one by one...<br/>\n<br/>\nthe two kittens that my friend took, one got pregnant. now we have two of her kittens. one was a hairless like their grandma and one fluffy like their mommy. the cats are great for the kids. there is a lot less fighting over the past year. each has their own kitty, and the kitties know who&#39;s kitty their are... tommy got the hairless and zoe got the fluffy one. the kids play together a lot more now. the have a common like that they can share. since tommy is 2 yrs younger, they had a hard time finding things they can play together. or things that tommy wouldn&#39;t mess up. <br/>\n<br/>\ni have to say that the cats have been an amazing addition to our family. <br/>\n<br/>\nif you can, try to find a sphynx... they are expensive, but you can find ones that are not from the show quality breeders. also, you can find an f1, f2, f3, or f4 kitten from an out breeding program that is coated... like one of ours... those sell for super cheap as they have hair, but they still have that great sphynx personality. they are little dogs, trapped in a cat. <br/>\n<br/>\nhere is a pic of ours <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dashafx.com/photos/DSC09459.jpg\">http://www.dashafx.com/photos/DSC09459.jpg</a>   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     ·´`·.(*·.¸(`·.¸ ¸.·´)¸.·*).·´`·<br/>\n     **           Dasha           **<br/>\n     **    Zoeya Ayn 11/17/2002   **<br/>\n     ** Tommy Rand III 02/02/2005 **<br/>\n     ·´`·.(¸.·´(¸.·* *·.¸)`·.¸).·´`·<br/>\n<br/>\n    Freedom to Fascism by Aaron Russo<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=freedom+to+fascism\">http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=freedom+to+fascism</a><br/>\n<br/>\n    Hope for America<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.RonPaul2008.com\">http://www.RonPaul2008.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":267954153,"authorName":"Brian & Alexandra Polikowsky","from":"&quot;Brian & Alexandra Polikowsky&quot; &lt;polykow@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:Please help me get out of this mainstream thinking!","postDate":"1184873775","msgId":25052,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODkwMWM3Y2EzYyQxMjVjZjk0MCRmYjhhZGNjY0BPZmZpY2U+","referencesHeader":"PGY3bzJ2Mytsb3Y4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25047,"nextInTopic":25058,"prevInTime":25051,"nextInTime":25053,"topicId":25024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-765786606\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I think it great <br/>\nthat cats can climb and hide when they want to get away from <br/>\nchildren. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all cats do that.
