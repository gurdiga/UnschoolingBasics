Most people think simply<br/>\n&gt; living your life around other people is &lt;social&gt; but that is not the<br/>\n&gt; definition, a truly social animal would not drive another member<br/>\n&gt; away. You posit that driving them out would be punishment since they<br/>\n&gt; are social, I posit that they are anti-social and that driving them<br/>\n&gt; out would be punishment because they then wouldn&#39;t have other people<br/>\n&gt; to prey on and not because they have some sort of genetic need to<br/>\n&gt; socialize.<br/>\n***********************************<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all exiles were/are from anti-social behavior, like murder.  In<br/>\nsome cases taboo breaking caused it and in others due to the religious<br/>\nconstraints.  Even today in one African tribe (the name escapes me at<br/>\nthe moment) they have very definite ideas about what are signs from<br/>\nG-d.  The birth of twins for example because it&#39;s an oddity, is<br/>\nconsidered a bad omen (they have a word for it) and so the parents<br/>\nmust abandon one of the twins for the good of the tribe.  If they<br/>\ndon&#39;t do this, they are driven out for the safety of the tribe.  I<br/>\nwould posit that the social aspect of this group of people is the<br/>\ncoming together for safety and shared labor.  You can tell they are<br/>\nsocial because they dance, celebrate and mourn together.  You are<br/>\ncorrect that simply living near another person does not make one<br/>\nsocial, but I would define social behavior as any behavior that<br/>\ncontributes to the good of the group as a whole.  As another poster<br/>\nsuggested, the definition of social is up for debate even by people<br/>\nfor whom this is a life&#39;s work.  But for me, this is my working<br/>\ndefinition.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in your example, you say driving them out would be punishment<br/>\nbecause the social group doesn&#39;t want them around for the safety of<br/>\nthe group.  That pretty much defines social to me.  But if you are<br/>\ndriven out because you got pregnant out of wedlock, you certainly<br/>\naren&#39;t anti-social and driving you out isn&#39;t for the safety of the<br/>\ngroup but to punish you for breaking societal rules and stripping you<br/>\nof your safety and social connection.  It is folly to believe that all<br/>\nsuch punishments are visited on the dangerous or mal-adjusted.<br/>\n<br/>\nShunning is still in use in Amish communities for breaking the social<br/>\ncontract where morals are concerned.  The group recognizes the need<br/>\nfor the individual to remain in the community so instead of exile<br/>\nwhich might lead to the person simply assimilating into the secular<br/>\nculture around them, they use shunning to make the point to the<br/>\ntransgressor and the community at large.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\nPS) Is this topic OT for this list?

She had one<br/>\nof the most artificial and contrived rearing situations on Earth.<br/>\nLoved and nutured until 4 weeks of age, then left in a park at night<br/>\nwith a note pinned to her chest. Brought to the Social Welfare<br/>\nInstitute and run through a battery of health checks like one might do<br/>\nto a foundling calf....then confined to a crib most of the time. At<br/>\n18 months old, she was presented to a family for adoption and they<br/>\nrejected her for not being able to sit still at dinner in the dining<br/>\nroom and not being quiet enough so they could pray. Additionally she<br/>\nwould refuse to look at them and she would not kiss and hug them.<br/>\n(They had her only 3 days and she had a cold.) So they returned<br/>\nher....with a hole in her heart. (They had pressured China to keep<br/>\nher from having her surgery to be able to do it in California where<br/>\nthey could pray over her.) So, because she was ill, and rejected, the<br/>\nSWI figured she was unadoptable and was too sick to be allowed the<br/>\nminimal play the other kids got. So she was tied flat on her back<br/>\ninto the crib and she stayed there for 5 months. No baths, no sitting<br/>\nup, no toys, but bedsores aplenty. The only contact she got was to be<br/>\nfed and changed and that was either by the person who abused her or<br/>\nsomeone else. When I petitioned the Chinese to be allowed to adopt<br/>\nher they did her heart surgery and she went from the SWI to being tied<br/>\ninto a hospital bed with no pain management after open heart surgery.<br/>\nShe was there for 8 weeks. Then returned to the SWI, where they<br/>\nattempted to &quot;fix&quot; her autism by letting her play outside for 20<br/>\nminutes once a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nMorgan would have attempted to make someone happy or unhappy if she<br/>\nhad the slightest inkling that she had some control over the world but<br/>\nthe world was something that happened TO her. This is not natural not<br/>\nby a long shot. Now that she&#39;s here, she expresses her displeasure,<br/>\nand happiness. The day she cried when she hit her head on the table<br/>\nwas one of the happiest of my life. That meant she felt something and<br/>\nexpressed it....because she knew someone was listening! Before that,<br/>\nnothing that happened to her made her express any emotion. She was<br/>\nnumb. I was pleased because I hadn&#39;t expected her to drop her<br/>\ndefenses this quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, I have continued to cheer her accomplishments. Things she tries<br/>\nto do, and does *properly* (meaning successfully like getting food on<br/>\na spoon and into her mouth...one of her biggest challenges) I say<br/>\n&quot;Good Job!&quot; because that&#39;s what she wants me to say. If she tries<br/>\nand fails she says &quot;uh-oh!&quot; then tries again after announcing &quot;nother<br/>\none&quot; meaning she will try again. I may be molding her behavior with<br/>\nthese displays of praise but for now, this is what she seems to want<br/>\nand need. I am following her lead. She will ask me to &quot;do dat?&quot; if<br/>\nshe needs help with something or she will sit and struggle with<br/>\nsomething herself if she wants to do it herself. But I think she&#39;s a<br/>\npretty happy kid. There are very few &quot;no&quot;s in her world and a WHOLE<br/>\nlot of cheering. Everything Morgan does is amazing. and she has<br/>\nconnected this praise to good feelings because she will cheer for me<br/>\nif I do something she thinks is hard. I think if she was feeling<br/>\npressured by this she wouldn&#39;t do it for me.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://temptabo.blogspot.com/\">http://temptabo.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                         <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

She had one<br/>\nof the most artificial and contrived rearing situations on Earth.<br/>\nLoved and nutured until 4 weeks of age, then left in a park at night<br/>\nwith a note pinned to her chest.  Brought to the Social Welfare<br/>\nInstitute and run through a battery of health checks like one might do<br/>\nto a foundling calf....then confined to a crib most of the time.  At<br/>\n18 months old, she was presented to a family for adoption and they<br/>\nrejected her for not being able to sit still at dinner in the dining<br/>\nroom and not being quiet enough so they could pray.  Additionally she<br/>\nwould refuse to look at them and she would not kiss and hug them.<br/>\n(They had her only 3 days and she had a cold.)  So they returned<br/>\nher....with a hole in her heart.  (They had pressured China to keep<br/>\nher from having her surgery to be able to do it in California where<br/>\nthey could pray over her.)  So, because she was ill, and rejected, the<br/>\nSWI figured she was unadoptable and was too sick to be allowed the<br/>\nminimal play the other kids got.  So she was tied flat on her back<br/>\ninto the crib and she stayed there for 5 months.  No baths, no sitting<br/>\nup, no toys, but bedsores aplenty.  The only contact she got was to be<br/>\nfed and changed and that was either by the person who abused her or<br/>\nsomeone else.  When I petitioned the Chinese to be allowed to adopt<br/>\nher they did her heart surgery and she went from the SWI to being tied<br/>\ninto a hospital bed with no pain management after open heart surgery.<br/>\nShe was there for 8 weeks.  Then returned to the SWI, where they<br/>\nattempted to &quot;fix&quot; her autism by letting her play outside for 20<br/>\nminutes once a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nMorgan would have attempted to make someone happy or unhappy if she<br/>\nhad the slightest inkling that she had some control over the world but<br/>\nthe world was something that happened TO her.  This is not natural not<br/>\nby a long shot.  Now that she&#39;s here, she expresses her displeasure,<br/>\nand happiness.  The day she cried when she hit her head on the table<br/>\nwas one of the happiest of my life.  That meant she felt something and<br/>\nexpressed it....because she knew someone was listening!  Before that,<br/>\nnothing that happened to her made her express any emotion.  She was<br/>\nnumb.  I was pleased because I hadn&#39;t expected her to drop her<br/>\ndefenses this quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, I have continued to cheer her accomplishments.  Things she tries<br/>\nto do, and does *properly* (meaning successfully like getting food on<br/>\na spoon and into her mouth...one of her biggest challenges) I say<br/>\n&quot;Good Job!&quot;  because that&#39;s what she wants me to say.  If she tries<br/>\nand fails she says &quot;uh-oh!&quot; then tries again after announcing &quot;nother<br/>\none&quot; meaning she will try again.  I may be molding her behavior with<br/>\nthese displays of praise but for now, this is what she seems to want<br/>\nand need.  I am following her lead.  She will ask me to &quot;do dat?&quot; if<br/>\nshe needs help with something or she will sit and struggle with<br/>\nsomething herself if she wants to do it herself.  But I think she&#39;s a<br/>\npretty happy kid.  There are very few &quot;no&quot;s in her world and a WHOLE<br/>\nlot of cheering.  Everything Morgan does is amazing.  and she has<br/>\nconnected this praise to good feelings because she will cheer for me<br/>\nif I do something she thinks is hard.  I think if she was feeling<br/>\npressured by this she wouldn&#39;t do it for me.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://temptabo.blogspot.com/\">http://temptabo.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Starting down the wrong path","postDate":"1205343829","msgId":30798,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQTUyN0ZDMjQ0MDRBNS00NTAtQjc2QE1CTEstTTA3LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDkxNDQ0NC40NjY4NC5xbUB3ZWI1MjQwNi5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":30797,"nextInTopic":30799,"prevInTime":30797,"nextInTime":30799,"topicId":30775,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

At least the desires to be social or  <br/>\nselfish are. How we go about fulfilling those desires, the techniques  <br/>\nwe use, are absorbed by living with others. The innate desire is  <br/>\nthere. And children pick up how to social (and selfish) by watching  <br/>\nus and others and trying various things out and being helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy theory about social and selfishness -- though I doubt that it&#39;s  <br/>\nnew -- is that we have the selfish, &quot;keep ourselves alive long enough  <br/>\nto reproduce&quot; drives of our reptilian (and further back) ancestors.  <br/>\nOverlaid on that is the &quot;come together and cooperate to survive&quot; of  <br/>\nour ape (and further back) ancestors. Both drives are perfectly  <br/>\nnatural, but also conflict with each other. (I suspect that&#39;s where  <br/>\nthe concept that man is inherently evil comes from. But it&#39;s not evil  <br/>\nto be selfish. Just reptilian ;-) And since the selfish drives are  <br/>\nway older, way more streamlined, they do come more naturally. But  <br/>\nwhen basic needs are met, it&#39;s way more useful to cooperate and that  <br/>\nnatural drive is in us. Being social is not merely an idea overlaid  <br/>\nby society. It&#39;s a real chemically driven need to be together.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH","from":"ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Starting down the wrong path","postDate":"1205339667","msgId":30795,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI5MTk1Mi4xNjg2MC5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNy5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":30794,"nextInTopic":30797,"prevInTime":30794,"nextInTime":30796,"topicId":30775,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
