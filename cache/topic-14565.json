For those of you who allow your children to have total <br/>\ncontrol of<br/>\n  whether they stay in activities, when and if they will do various <br/>\nthings,<br/>\n  whether it is projects, chores, etc., how do they learn to be <br/>\naccountable<br/>\n and self-disciplined?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Be being ourselves, self-disciplined and accountable. They learn it by <br/>\nseeing it modeled for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Like if your child got some kind of volunteer<br/>\n  position helping out at say, a bike shop b/c he wanted to learn more <br/>\nabout<br/>\n  bikes, and he said he would work for 6 weeks, but gets bored after 2 <br/>\nweeks,<br/>\n  you would let him just quit? How does that teach them to honor their <br/>\nword?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Would you want an employee who didn&#39;t want to be there? I like <br/>\nemployees who LOVE their jobs, who look forward to work! I&#39;m happy to <br/>\nlet go someone who was terribly unhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=--=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  They are children, but accountability/self-discipline is expected <br/>\nlater in<br/>\n  life, whether you are working or staying at home and it seems like if <br/>\nthey<br/>\n  don&#39;t learn it at home, they aren&#39;t going to just pop up and learn it <br/>\nas an<br/>\n adult.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-==-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  They learn it at home and out in the world as children. They learn it <br/>\nbecause I&#39;m hard-working and diligent. I *like* what I do. They see <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Forcing someone to do something against his will doesn&#39;t make him <br/>\naccountable or disciplined. It makes him sneaky and---&lt;g&gt;---lazy!<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n And I also disagree that some people aren&#39;t lazy.<br/>\n<br/>\n --=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  I agree. Some people are. But not because they were treated with <br/>\nrespect and concern.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think they seem lazy because they refuse to DO it any more. They <br/>\nfigure *they* had to do it as a child, so now someone else can do it. <br/>\nIt&#39;s really about a lack of respect because they were never respected.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It can also be due to depression. A person may seem lazy because she <br/>\ncan&#39;t get up the energy to do anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n But I think most &quot;laziness&quot; is due to a lack of respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Respect the child. The child will respect you, himself, and others <br/>\ndeserving of respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes, you can<br/>\n  sometimes choose when to do things, but if you are a trash man and you <br/>\ndon&#39;t<br/>\n  complete your rounds within the allotted time frame, eventually you <br/>\nwill be<br/>\n  fired. Your boss won&#39;t accept &quot;I have a different energy level.&quot; I&#39;m <br/>\npretty<br/>\n  sure he would call that lazy and that he won&#39;t let you take 2 extra <br/>\nhours to<br/>\n  get your job done. How can you justify that view in the work world <br/>\nwhich<br/>\n our kids will be in someday?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  I doubt someone with a low energy level will choose a job that <br/>\nrequires a high level.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have a high energy level, so I don&#39;t choose things that require a <br/>\nlow level (unless I&#39;m doing two/three things at once! &lt;g&gt;). I&#39;d be <br/>\nbored to tears.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please know I&#39;m not attacking anyone. I AM trying to see the other <br/>\npoint of<br/>\n view, but, um, I&#39;m having a really hard time..? ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=--=<br/>\n<br/>\n We understand. It&#39;s not easy. But it&#39;s simpler than you think.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  My husband is thinking the unschooling idea is interesting b/c he is <br/>\none of<br/>\n  those who never did like school and well, his grades showed it. And <br/>\nwhat he<br/>\n  was interested in then, he now does today - computers, and more <br/>\nrecently<br/>\n video and sound. Cool, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n  Very cool.

Ask! Ask how it&#39;s possible. Ask what people do and how  <br/>\n&gt; it works.

Discipline is when you choose to do something, perhaps <br/>\ndifficult and that you don&#39;t want to do right now, because of some kind <br/>\nof internal motivation.  It has to come from within and you have to have <br/>\nthe freedom to choose not to do it but choose to do it anyway.  If you <br/>\ncan&#39;t choose not to do it, then it isn&#39;t discipline.  It&#39;s obediance.  I <br/>\nthink the only way to &quot;teach&quot; this is to model it in ourselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as far as the school counselor&#39;s comment goes, I hope that my <br/>\nchildren never ever learn to force themselves into drudgery just for a <br/>\npaycheck but learn to follow their hearts and do what they truly love. <br/>\n-alice</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244909672,"authorName":"freepsgal","from":"&quot;freepsgal&quot; &lt;freepsgal@...&gt;","profile":"freepsgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: character traits?","postDate":"1150325706","msgId":14576,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU2cTQ0YStkbTF0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNjIwMWM2OGZlNSRhNGE5MjhiMCQ2NTAyYThjMEBiYXJibWNlPg=="},"prevInTopic":14573,"nextInTopic":14584,"prevInTime":14575,"nextInTime":14577,"topicId":14565,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The only committment I can think of <br/>\nthat I honored was my year-long committment at being a Brownie Girl <br/>\nScout Leader when I was 33 years old.  The first year was super.  <br/>\nThe second year was really difficult and I wanted to quit halfway <br/>\nthrough.  However, I stuck with it because I just knew it was the <br/>\nright thing to do.  So apparently I was able to honor a committment <br/>\non my own without being forced to do so previously.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How can you justify that view in the work world which our kids<br/>\n&gt; will be in someday?<br/>\n&gt; Barbara<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My guess is that they&#39;ll stick to jobs that they feel they can <br/>\nhandle.  For example, I have never had an interest in working in the <br/>\nfood industry.  The idea of standing behind a counter serving <br/>\nfood or waiting on tables just never appealed to me.  But I <br/>\nabsolutely loved working at the movie theater.  I doubt a person who <br/>\nleans towards laziness is going to have such an active job like <br/>\nbeing a sanitation employee.  I sure have known lots of secretaries, <br/>\nprofessors, and business office employees who are lazy though!  And <br/>\nthey drew nice salaries!  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] character traits?","postDate":"1150319956","msgId":14573,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM3NDRDM0IwLTlBM0ItNEU3RS04MTdELTNDMTZFMEYxRkY0QkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNjIwMWM2OGZlNSRhNGE5MjhiMCQ2NTAyYThjMEBiYXJibWNlPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwNjIwMWM2OGZlNSRhNGE5MjhiMCQ2NTAyYThjMEBiYXJibWNlPg=="},"prevInTopic":14569,"nextInTopic":14576,"prevInTime":14572,"nextInTime":14574,"topicId":14565,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Do they have a good friend on the team that <br/>\nmay be disappointed?  Are they in the playoffs without anyone to <br/>\nfill their place?  Ask them how they think they&#39;ll feel if they <br/>\nquit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKids (heck, adults too) don&#39;t always know what they will enjoy until <br/>\nthey try it.

Perhaps (in<br/>\nthis scenario) the work is boring because the shop owner isn&#39;t letting<br/>\nhim do the things that he invisioned doing.
