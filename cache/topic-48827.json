DH gradually got drawn into it, simply by being in the same room (ditto for crossword puzzles but that&#39;s a whole other topic lol). When he chose to start college, he took the whole lot of CLEP exams - and came out saying &quot;that was a lot like playing Jeopardy - especially the fine arts and history.&quot; Fast forward to now - I still like to watch Jeopardy when I can and now both DH and DS (who is now 14) watch along with me. Sometimes DS will ask me to not say the answer out loud until he has a chance first - and he&#39;s gradually getting some of the answers simply by watching more Jeopardy (and discussing interesting answers and categories).

Did he specifically stipulate that this plan must include daily written assignments? Are you at risk of losing custody if he rejects a plan that suits the needs and learning styles of your kids, which might not include any tangible proof of &quot;schooling&quot; (i.e., written work)?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless he is specifically checking that written assignments have been completed, as public school teachers do, and has a judge backing up this sort of demand, learning does not have to look like school at all, and does not have to follow a schedule that conflicts with the kids&#39; own natural schedules. Learning happens through conversations, games, going places, collecting things, exploring nature, watching TV and other electronic media, reading and being read to, listening to and playing music, cooking and gardening and helping around the house, and pretty much everything the kids do. Everything the kids learn can be put into school-ish categories, if you must.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can make some notes about what your kids have done each day or week, you will probably be able to retroactively list their activities in school-subject categories. Keeping a journal of what they have done and what kinds of conversations you&#39;ve had with them should be enough to show that you&#39;re following some kind of educational plan. It&#39;s usually just a matter of being mindful of little things that might otherwise have gone unnoticed (like when one of the children asks how to spell a word or what a word means, or notices a bird outside and you tell him what kind of bird it is, or showing the kids state quarters and collecting them in a folder with a map of the U.S., or playing with a talking globe or puzzle-map or magnets, or putting together a model of a dinosaur skeleton, or you and the kids catching a news headline together, or measuring with fractions to follow a recipe ... etc).<br/>\nPhotos of the kids doing &quot;educational&quot; things (like visiting a museum, going to the library, reading or being read to, spelling out words with alphabet magnets, watching science and nature shows, looking at a bug through a magnifying glass, etc) are also good for record-keeping and &quot;proof&quot; of their education. What you may have to &quot;prove&quot; to your ex-husband, for whatever reason, is not likely to exceed what you have to &quot;prove&quot; to the state, to comply with whatever homeschool laws your state may have. And in most states, journals and photo/video collections are usually enough for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I would think that he wouldn&#39;t need to know everything that goes on in your home, in terms of bedtimes or &quot;schoolwork&quot; or video game playing. You can run your household the way you see fit, and he can run his household the way he sees fit. You can allow the children to learn the things they choose to learn, in the ways that work for them, and he can drill them on trivia facts of his choice, as if they were preparing to be contestants on Jeopardy. You just need to let the kids know that their father&#39;s insistence that they must know a, b, or c does not invalidate the fact that they have learned x, y, or z on their own, in fun ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237699340,"authorName":"messy_boys","from":"&quot;messy_boys&quot; &lt;messy_boys@...&gt;","profile":"messy_boys","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"How to find a compromise?","postDate":"1343678806","msgId":48827,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp2NnBnbStoZWRuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48842,"prevInTime":48826,"nextInTime":48828,"topicId":48827,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am really struggling with various things, and hoping for some input and experience from you all.

You may or may","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-916345224\">I am really struggling with various things, and hoping for some input and experience from you all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been deschooling for a while now.  You may or may not remember that I have six children, ages 14 - 2, and that I have recently divorced my alcoholic husband.  Many of you suggested that our deschooling would simply look like vacation and that is pretty much what we&#39;ve done.  In many ways it has been great and I see improvements in our relationships and more joy in our home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ex-husband is not on board with unschooling.  He has been putting pressure on me to come up with a plan for their school this year, so I tried to put together something as loose as possible, but it is not unschooling.  It&#39;s minimal...but it still requires us to get certain things done each day.  I&#39;ve started to try and start shifting everyone towards bedtimes so that when we begin, we can get our stuff done in the morning...and so my household is now dissolving into the same old stress and battleground it used to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep trying to figure out if there are more options that I&#39;m not seeing.  Maybe a compromise.  If we didn&#39;t do school until after lunch, then my 11 yo would still be able to stay up pretty late (he likes to play Minecraft/skype at night).  But that&#39;s another thing my ex is unhappy about.  He doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s good for them to not have a bedtime and to be on the computer so much.  He wants me to limit their time.  I tried to talk to him about all they&#39;ve learned and how much they enjoy it, but he basically just laughed in my face.  He insinuates that I am a neglectful mother and that he wants to see me stick to this plan.  He said, &quot;I want to be able to talk to them and see that they&#39;re getting some smarts.&quot;  ???  What the heck does that mean?  That they can memorize???<br/>\n<br/>\nI find myself feeling that I want to swing the pendulum back...to no video games/computer/tv at all...because trying to find the middle and enforce limits is exhausting!!!  I hate it!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease help me figure this out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKristie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48828,"nextTopicId":48863}}
