Not only does eating a diet high in fat, sugar and preservatives<br/>\nmake people fat it also appears to cause depression and put people in a<br/>\n&quot;fog&quot; mentally so we become less intelligent. <br/>\nMy family and I don&#39;t eat fast foods very often. Maybe once or twice a<br/>\nmonth. We have added organics to our diet. My kids still choose to eat<br/>\nwhat they would like to eat. Even with information that is scary to<br/>\nthem. They still choose to smoke, although two of them quit smoking a<br/>\nfew weeks back. Three of them smoke pot occassionally and I just found<br/>\nout my son is snorting pills occassionally. He is the one who has<br/>\ndyslexia and was sexually abused at school when he was 6-7. I can say I<br/>\nam really proud of him because he just got his first job and is doing<br/>\nwell there. The boss knows he has dyslexia so he treats him as though he<br/>\nis the &quot;dumb&quot; kid though. If there is a mistake he assumes my son did<br/>\nit. That sound you hear is my heart breaking. At least he comes home and<br/>\ntalks about his day with all of us. My kids told me they use<br/>\noccassionally. They know I worry about them. Not that that helps:) I<br/>\nfeel like I can&#39;t talk to people about it because people can be so<br/>\njudgemental. If I had a magic wand things would be different. Yet, I<br/>\nwould be &quot;in control&quot; of my kids and I know that wouldnt work either.<br/>\nThey are doing less than I did as a teenager. Hopefully with open,<br/>\nhonest, non-judgemental, loving discussions they will choose other<br/>\nhabits that are healthier. I do hear them say they are all bored. We do<br/>\nso much as a family, they do things all the time. I think they may mean<br/>\nthey feel like they have no clear direction in life. I will talk to them<br/>\nabout that.
