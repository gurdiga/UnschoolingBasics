I&#39;m new to this group and to uschooling.  I was wondering if<br/>\n&gt; anyone might direct me to the best postings in this group to read to<br/>\n&gt; get me started in the basics?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I homeschool 3 beautiful children that truly love learning (not from<br/>\n&gt; a textbook).  We have tried various methods of homeschooling (charter<br/>\n&gt; school, ISP through a private school, and now we are our own private<br/>\n&gt; school and follow our own rules!!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have fears that I&#39;m not teaching them what they really need to<br/>\n&gt; learn as far as math and grammar, etc. goes by giving up a textbook<br/>\n&gt; and worksheets.  How do I learn to let go of those fears.  How can I<br/>\n&gt; unschool math or prepare my highschooler for college?  My 8 year old<br/>\n&gt; groans (loudly) if I ask him to pick up a book and read it to me.<br/>\n&gt; Yet, he will read words on his video game, computer, tv, billboards,<br/>\n&gt; etc.  Is that enough?  I really need some quick advice on just what<br/>\n&gt; unschooling is and how to get going at it so we all can be calm and<br/>\n&gt; enjoy life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks to anyone who responds!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSent from Gmail for mobile | mobile.google.com </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":230388967,"authorName":"Tpowerwoman@aol.com","from":"Tpowerwoman@...","profile":"monarch4boys","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] getting started","postDate":"1142355164","msgId":10767,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZkLjU2ZTk4Y2MzLjMxNDg0ZWRjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":10743,"nextInTopic":32166,"prevInTime":10766,"nextInTime":10768,"topicId":10742,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/13/2006 10:15:20 P.M.
