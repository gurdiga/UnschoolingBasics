I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-17573771\">Here are my two cents as well!!  As another said, I feel it&#39;s part of my &quot;job&quot; to do the best I can with our family&#39;s money (I do most of the shopping!).  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I found that planning each evening meal has **really** helped lower our budget!!  I used to believe that if we were out of something it needed to be replaced.  Not now.  Only if it&#39;s needed (or requested by someone else).  I also found that a well stocked pantry that some &quot;experts&quot; tout intimidated me with all sorts of choices versus 5 - 7 meals which were ready to go.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I buy dry beans and cook them myself in bulk and freeze them in 1 1/2 - 2 cup portions.  How easy is it to take them out of the freezer!!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Most chain grocery stores really do have a rotating 4 week schedule of what they&#39;ll put on sale.  So, I buy it that way.  Bread when it&#39;s on sale, buttery spread, pasta, etc.  If you keep your receipts and/or your circulars, you&#39;ll start to notice a pattern as well.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Except for mac & cheese, potato chips, and occasional cereal, we buy nothing premade.  This not only saves us money, but tastes better too!!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  At times, I will go to a second grocery store for a sale.  We also buy most of our cheese at Target.  We try to combine trips and talk about errands we can run at the same time to both lessen the amount of gas we use and to think about the planet as well.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I shop with a list and try not to stray.  I *do* solicit requests for food items and fill as many as I am able (up to and including while shopping).  If we&#39;ve hit &quot;max&quot; for the week, we try ways around it.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We don&#39;t shop at whole/natural foods stores (yet!!).  I&#39;m in the process of visiting those to figure them out and their pricing. This coincides with our family&#39;s journey into organics.  We do have an expanding aspiring organic garden in warm months.  This alone has been an amazing experience for all of us!!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We don&#39;t eat much meat (I eat almost none) which also helps out in the budget.  I also borrow Moosewood and Vegetarian Times cookbooks from the library and make things that sound intersting.  When dh comes home and it&#39;s a new something for dinner he asks if it&#39;s Moosewood or Vegetarian Times.  Poor guy.  Used to be a carnivore (yep. no veggies, little fruit)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We spend about $250 per month on groceries.  The bulk of that is easily on produce.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Although it may sound anal, I kept a price book (a running list of items we use and their prices, sizes, and brands at several stores) for some time.  This really helped me to see where things were cheapest and enabled me to save even more.  Some times those stores who touted the best prices weren&#39;t always the best places.  It was enlightening.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hope some of this helps!!  Great topic!!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  TTFN!!<br/>\n  Jane<br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jane Powell <br/>\n  Tribe&#39;s Partner<br/>\n   <br/>\n  &quot;You must be the change you wish to see in the world.&quot; - Gandhi <br/>\n   <br/>\n  &quot;There is no right way to do the wrong thing.&quot; - unknown <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

I sat down with my kids and <br/>\ncompletely went over our budget and spending plan.  We spent a total <br/>\nof $5,558.38 last year on groceries, or an average of $463.19 a <br/>\nmonth.  We are a family of five, me, husband and three teenagers, 21, <br/>\n15 and 12.

That way they <br/>\nget to learn how to eat and cook healthy and I am also not wasting <br/>\nfood by feeding them something they just don&#39;t like.  We use all <br/>\norganic items (which can be expensive in itself) and have learned to <br/>\ndo without meat a few nights a week.  We eat a lot of pasta, fresh <br/>\nfruits and vegetables, salads, soup and sandwiches.  We try to make it <br/>\nfun by keeping all different types of salads, fruit salads, macaroni <br/>\nsalad, potatoe salads, cut up vegetables and regular salad that can be <br/>\nused with a lot of meals and mix and match.  I don&#39;t keep a lot of <br/>\nmeat in the freezer, because, like I stated before, we don&#39;t eat a lot <br/>\nof meat, but I do make up extras of muffins, twice baked potatoes, <br/>\nindividual sizes of lasagna (when I make a large one) and then freeze <br/>\nthem for quick and simple meals when we are running behind on time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think our biggest leak, in our budget, is entertainment and cell <br/>\nphones.

Then on nights when we know we will be pressed for time, <br/>\nwe just have to reheat something.  It has really helped.

We also switch<br/>\nbrands of foods depending on the sales. There are some products I buy<br/>\nonly one name brand, but mostly, I buy whatever is the cheapest. We<br/>\nalso buy alot from BJ&#39;s (local warehouse, like Sam&#39;s club) and from<br/>\nwalmart. I buy meat, cereal, baking products, and snacks in bulk and<br/>\nthen pack them in smaller portions. This saves alot of money.  We have<br/>\na family of 5 and we spend about $300 a month on groceries. That<br/>\nincludes most of the cleaning and hygeine products too. We eat alot of<br/>\nfresh fruit and dairy products, which can be expensive. We drink<br/>\nmostly water and milk. Very little juice (that saves mega money). I<br/>\nbuy cakes and cookies on occasion but mostly bake them myself from<br/>\nscratch. <br/>\n<br/>\nCoupons can really help. And if the week&#39;s coupons are particularly<br/>\ngood, I&#39;ll go out and buy more sunday papers. the $1.50 I spend on the<br/>\npaper is well worth it if there are alot of good coupons.  In years<br/>\npast, I participated in coupon swaps. Sometimes your local library has<br/>\nthis - a box filled with coupons. You take and leave what you want. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have looked at the once-a-month and once-a-week cooking guides. I<br/>\nknow I couldn&#39;t do it. It&#39;s just not me. And certainly not my family.<br/>\nWe are very basic in our eating. They don&#39;t like casseroles, stews, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for other areas of our life, we do very little take-out and dining<br/>\nout. When we do, we look for the specials (one steak resturant does<br/>\nkids free night so we take advantage of that). Most of their clothes<br/>\nare either from consignment sales (gently worn) or bought by<br/>\nrelatives. We are not desperate for money. We could afford to buy all<br/>\nnew clothes but I am philosophically apposed to it. Why buy new,<br/>\nwasting more money, and environmental resources, when there are so<br/>\nmany gently worn clothes available. Then again, I have been lucky to<br/>\nlive in areas with good consign stores and events. The same for many<br/>\nof the toys the kids have, though I do buy new toys often because I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to wait for another consignment sale to buy a particular toy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nhope that helps<br/>\n<br/>\nalison</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Any ideas for SAHM/Unschooling moms to save $$ on groceries?","postDate":"1167425484","msgId":20092,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVuM3Y0Yys2MHAwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVuM3V1OCtpZzFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20091,"nextInTopic":20094,"prevInTime":20091,"nextInTime":20093,"topicId":20085,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I forgot one other thing we do.

We occasionally had<br/>\nsome disposables in a pinch, but 90% of our diapers were the re-usable<br/>\nkind :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we save a ton of money on household cleaners.  We threw out all the<br/>\nchemical stuff and replaced it all with vinegar, baking soda, and plain<br/>\nold hot water (homemade cleaning recipes are very easy to find on the<br/>\ninternet and vinegar does not stink up the house, it actually absorbs<br/>\nsmells then vanishes, much like baking soda does).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also are extremely miserly on how much laundry detergent we put in<br/>\nour machine (we use the $$$ unscented environmentally conscious stuff,<br/>\nand even then I spend way less than I used to.).  We just kept adding<br/>\nless and less detergent as time wore on and experimented with how clean<br/>\nand fresh smelling it was, and sure enough, it was terrific with a very<br/>\nmiserly 1/8 cup (2 tbsp) per LARGE load.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese might seem like little ways, but every bit does help.  Use among<br/>\nthose suggestions those which strike you as the most practical for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriannah in NS<br/>\nPS Did anybody see my introduction(s)?

I decided to pull up a report on our grocery spending and<br/>\nfound that we were spending over twice our budget on groceries the<br/>\nlast few months. I know it included other things like diapers,<br/>\nshampoo, laundry soap, etc., but this is a major leak. I realize how<br/>\nwasteful we seem to be when I sit and think about it - it&#39;s like<br/>\nthrowing away money. So my goal, which I plan to make a game of, is<br/>\nto cut down on the $$ leak via the groceries.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile trying to find information on eating healthy and cheap on the<br/>\nweb, I ran across a lot of &#39;once a month cooking&#39; sites and plans.<br/>\nIs there any one here who does this or has had experience with cooking<br/>\nahead? I don&#39;t know if I could cook one months worth of food, but I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t mind trying a weeks worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough my research, I ran across &#39;Dine on a Dime Cookbook&#39;. - Which<br/>\nbrought me to this site that I would like to share that seems to have<br/>\nsome helpful hints. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livingonadime.com/index.html\">http://www.livingonadime.com/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI looked at the cookbook on Amazon.com. (I buy mostly all my books<br/>\nthere or check out books there first because I can look inside and<br/>\nread some of it first to see if I&#39;ll like it.) The cookbook had really<br/>\ngreat ratings and reader reviews compared to some of the other books I<br/>\nwas looking at - so I bought it. Does any one else here already have<br/>\nthis book?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m aware that this seems to be off the &#39;unschooling&#39; topic, but I<br/>\nthink this is going to be fun for the family to be more creative with<br/>\nour food and money.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy New Year resolution for all areas of my life is &#39;Simplify&#39;!<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20139,"nextTopicId":20161}}
