I can&#39;t respond to the messages from my mail (keep getting <br/>\nsomething about I can&#39;t reply to yahoogroups from my location that I <br/>\nneed to connect to Bellsouth - and I&#39;m on a Bellsouth DSL line - so <br/>\ngo figure.  Bellsouth can&#39;t figure it out)  So I went no mail <br/>\nthinking I would just read and respond from yahoogroups.  You <br/>\nbecame &quot;out of sight out of mind&quot; because you ended up filing on the <br/>\nsecond page.  Sorry!!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had a great winter so far.  Keon (my 6yo) has had a store run <br/>\nin our house.  It was great fun.  He was stealing our things and <br/>\nselling them back to us (at varying prices).  WE even had to <br/>\npurchase kleenex from him (at 5¢ a piece).  He made around $5 in 2.5 <br/>\ndays of business.  Today he is having a &quot;going out of business sale&quot; <br/>\nand I think I am going to do a buy out after his sisters have <br/>\nfinished shopping.  He has enjoyed his whole game of setting up <br/>\nshop, having a sale, making transactions and change, writing out <br/>\nreciepts in case you want to exchange something (no; he won&#39;t refund <br/>\nyour money on used kleenex - I tried LOL!), having store hours, <br/>\ntaking breaks, creating an &quot;employees lounge&quot; (which I&#39;m not allowed <br/>\nto be in because I am not an employee) paying his employees (he&#39;s <br/>\nbeen paying his sisters 25¢ a day to keep watch over his store when <br/>\nhe has taken bathroom breaks and lunch breaks.  I&#39;ve loved watching <br/>\nhim be so serious in his endeavor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, maybe now I will remember to check page 2 for messages LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4839,"nextTopicId":4851}}
