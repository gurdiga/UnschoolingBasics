I believe he was<br/>\n16 at the time.  I had this child at the Boys and Girls Club I used to<br/>\nwork at before I had my second son.  I don&#39;t remember him much as I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t work in the Teen Room.  However, he was obviously troubled, as<br/>\nwere many of the children that came to hang out with us after school.  <br/>\nThis boy got 22 to life and he&#39;s just a child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis particular statement he made in court yesterday REALLY stuck out<br/>\nto me and I wanted to share it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I couldn&#39;t stand having someone controlling me like that,&quot; he told<br/>\npolice. &quot;It didn&#39;t seem worth it to wait until I was 18 to have<br/>\ncontrol of myself.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s SO MUCH MORE to this case than that statement.  But sheesh, I<br/>\nremember saying things like that when I was teenager.  Hating the<br/>\ncontrol everyone tried to place on me.  Not being trusted until I was<br/>\n18 and then &quot;POOF&quot; I was set free and made a mess of my life a few<br/>\nyears while I sorted everything out.  So many times my 9 year old has<br/>\nsaid &quot;Mom, I know my body better than you do.&quot; and so many times have<br/>\nI looked at him and said &quot;You&#39;re right!&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, this is an extreme example but I think its a really good<br/>\nexample of how dangerous control can be.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33324,"nextTopicId":33471}}
