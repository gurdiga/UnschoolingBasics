I said oh she didn&#39;t have to if she didn&#39;t want  <br/>\nto.  He insisted. I took him aside and said something about playing  <br/>\nthe piano is a joyful thing and hopefully it would continue to be but  <br/>\nif he MADE her it probably wouldn&#39;t be and would have the opposite  <br/>\neffect.

And I m a little sick today, so might not make much","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1070307564\">I&#39;m having trouble distinguishing when I should say something &quot;RUish&quot;<br/>\nand when I should just let things go. And I&#39;m a little sick today, so<br/>\nmight not make much sense. Here&#39;s the latest example: I read a blog<br/>\nthat I love, and get a lot out of. Recently, the author wrote a<br/>\nsuggestion that people keep stickers in their purse, and if they see a<br/>\nchild crying in a store, offer a sticker - one mom supporting another.<br/>\nJust today, she wrote about a response she got... well, you can go<br/>\nread it here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://37days.typepad.com/37days/2008/05/i-stand-correct.html\">http://37days.typepad.com/37days/2008/05/i-stand-correct.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nbut basically the person said she&#39;d take the sticker *away* from her<br/>\nchild, and why would you &#39;reward&#39; a child who was crying, and probably<br/>\nher child would then cry every time they went to the store so they<br/>\ncould get a sticker. I did write a response to that, which is probably<br/>\nkinda incoherent due to strong feelings and the aforementioned<br/>\nsickness. I suggested they try to see things from the child&#39;s<br/>\nperspective, and I also said if a child purposefully cried in a store<br/>\nto get a sticker, that meant they weren&#39;t getting enough stickers at home!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I questioned writing that. I do want folks to see there&#39;s a<br/>\ndifferent way to look at things... but I don&#39;t want to &quot;cram things&quot;<br/>\ndown someone&#39;s throat... (what does that even mean?). I know I feel,<br/>\ntoo, that I need to respond *now* because of the ephemeral nature of<br/>\nonline discussion - if I waited to become centered and write out a<br/>\nwell-thought-out reply, the discussion would have &#39;moved on&#39;. I have<br/>\ngotten positive responses from people - they hadn&#39;t heard of<br/>\nnon-coercive parenting until I said something, and are glad I spoke<br/>\nup. I also know by speaking my beliefs, I&#39;m setting myself up for<br/>\ndisagreement from people. Normally, that&#39;s OK, I can stand in my<br/>\nbeliefs, but if for some reason I&#39;m feeling vulnerable then that&#39;s<br/>\ntougher.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll right, I&#39;m rambling now... how to be an advocate through more than<br/>\njust living our lives? How to advocate in the larger world -<br/>\nespecially online - without totally pushing people away? Any<br/>\nexperience and thoughts would be appreciated. And if you wanted to<br/>\nleave a centered, well-thought-out reply on Patti&#39;s post, that would<br/>\nbe OK, too. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nCaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33164,"nextTopicId":33220}}
