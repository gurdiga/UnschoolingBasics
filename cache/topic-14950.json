Your family is healing and sometimes that&#39;s a long process, but you&#39;re on the right track!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an easy one for me to answer. I&#39;ve seen it first hand. My kids are now 12 and 17. I *know* that raising children with respect, freedom, kindness and gentle guidance will bring forth absolutely amazing teenagers because I&#39;ve got &#39;em. :o) And  I&#39;m absolutely confident that they will in turn become incredible, caring adults who will continue to better this world with their presence and actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow&#39;s that for hand-holding?

Slow steps and with a lenghty and pretty comfy rest-<br/>\n&gt; stop in being attatched and compassionate with empathetic imposition <br/>\n&gt; of the adult way on the children (the adult way being as respectful <br/>\n&gt; of the kids as an adult way can be).  Now we have begun the leg of <br/>\n&gt; the journey that brings us closer to an unschooled LIFE and the <br/>\n&gt; transition is smooth AND bumpy depending on what comfort level DH <br/>\n&gt; and/or I am up against.  The unschooled education part was and <br/>\n&gt; remains easy for us (and we&#39;re teachers! hee-hee).

But, I do keep coming back to examples such as: my parents <br/>\n&gt; punished me regularly for not keeping my room neat...it did not make <br/>\n&gt; me neat...it just continues to make me feel inadequate for not <br/>\n&gt; caring about housework as much as she did or rather the judgements <br/>\n&gt; people might make based on the appearance of my bedroom (boy do I <br/>\n&gt; struggle with this!!!)  So, why would I think that doing things the <br/>\n&gt; way my parents did be the way to go?!  Same with food...I ended up <br/>\n&gt; with an eating problem and grew up in a house in which you had to <br/>\n&gt; eat your veggies, restrict your treats (or better yet...sneak <br/>\n&gt; them).  Why would I do the same thing and expect a different <br/>\n&gt; result?! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OK, so free/unschooled sounds so good on paper...but, the reality is <br/>\n&gt; we are transitioning into this unschooled life and carry with us the <br/>\n&gt; baggage of our own upbringing, but also our children&#39;s baggage of <br/>\n&gt; their 8 and 4 years of living in a house that was somewhat <br/>\n&gt; controlling and also included/includes the pain of mental illness <br/>\n&gt; issues, physical health issues, child death, and complicated grief.  <br/>\n&gt; We are really only &#39;just now&#39; getting back on our feet as a <br/>\n&gt; family...restated...I am only &#39;just now&#39; showing signs of recovery <br/>\n&gt; and feeling able to make these changes toward freedom...but it&#39;s a <br/>\n&gt; very quick and slippery step for me to find myself back with trauma <br/>\n&gt; and stress issues.  (We&#39;ve all got our stuff...I don&#39;t think for a <br/>\n&gt; minute there are many families unschooling out there who have not <br/>\n&gt; been touched by some sort of issue...I&#39;m just alluding to some of <br/>\n&gt; ours.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m writing WAY too much.  Sorry.  Seems I&#39;ve let the proverbial <br/>\n&gt; cork out of the bottle!  LMAO!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The bottom line for me is...today I need to hear it&#39;s OK.  That if <br/>\n&gt; we keep moving toward freedom we will not end up with -- to quote <br/>\n&gt; the tape playing in my head at times -- spoiled-rotten, ungrateful, <br/>\n&gt; rude and self-centered (as in selfish) children.  That responding <br/>\n&gt; with kindness when my nearly 4 year old demands in what can be <br/>\n&gt; considered a very rude way for an item at the dinner table I&#39;m not --<br/>\n&gt; a quote again-- creating a monster?  That when I ask for some help <br/>\n&gt; cleaning up a mess in the house, one made by the 4 year old in <br/>\n&gt; particular in this instance, and am told NO (sharply too, geez!) I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; not, again, creating a kid who will always be inconsiterate?  And my <br/>\n&gt; personal favorite...how do I stop feeling like &quot;I&#39;m the only one who <br/>\n&gt; does anything around here?&quot;  That&#39;s an oldie, but goodie tape that <br/>\n&gt; starts up pretty easily when I&#39;m tired...I&#39;ll go happily along for <br/>\n&gt; days counting the blessings in cleaning up, taking care of others, <br/>\n&gt; etc. and then all of a sudden wham!  I feel totally taken advantage <br/>\n&gt; of, over worked and under appreciated and that darn it, don&#39;t I <br/>\n&gt; deserve some common courtesy?  Really...is it too much to ask for <br/>\n&gt; the family to pick up after themselves?  I know...I hit a hot button <br/>\n&gt; (for the list as well as myself).  I&#39;m not saying anyone here is <br/>\n&gt; wrong...I&#39;m just sharing my struggle in trying to move in a more <br/>\n&gt; free direction.  I&#39;m revealing my doubts in the hopes those here <br/>\n&gt; with more experience can shine the light a little further along the <br/>\n&gt; tunnel for me.  I&#39;m not here to bash you or judge what you are <br/>\n&gt; doing.... I&#39;m here for some help with dealing with the voices and <br/>\n&gt; tapes of the past, both mine and those of my kids during this <br/>\n&gt; transition.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *So*... <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are you sure???  Really????  Is it true???<br/>\n&gt; Responding to rudeness, destruction, physical aggression, etc. with <br/>\n&gt; kindess really, really, really will turn out OK?  Gosh this sounds <br/>\n&gt; SO dumb when I actually type it...  Am I correct in thinking that we <br/>\n&gt; are in a de-schooling period as we unlearn a more &quot;time-out&quot; style <br/>\n&gt; of parenting?  Is what feels like &quot;taking advantage&quot; really just <br/>\n&gt; getting a fill of a need that wasn&#39;t being met? There&#39;s listening, <br/>\n&gt; and talking, there&#39;s modeling...but there&#39;s also nagging doubt, <br/>\n&gt; exhaustion and frustration on my end.   Will this all be OK?  (Note: <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve read Rue&#39;s book, been lurking here since the conference in <br/>\n&gt; Peabody which I attended, and have been reading Naomi Aldert&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; articles.)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I probably haven&#39;t spent nearly enough time re-reading and editing <br/>\n&gt; this post for clarity or stupidity, but my kids need me to get <br/>\n&gt; myself dressed and ready for a doctor&#39;s appointment they scheduled <br/>\n&gt; for themselves today.

So, why would I think that doing things the <br/>\nway my parents did be the way to go?!  Same with food...I ended up <br/>\nwith an eating problem and grew up in a house in which you had to <br/>\neat your veggies, restrict your treats (or better yet...sneak <br/>\nthem).  Why would I do the same thing and expect a different <br/>\nresult?! <br/>\n<br/>\nOK, so free/unschooled sounds so good on paper...but, the reality is <br/>\nwe are transitioning into this unschooled life and carry with us the <br/>\nbaggage of our own upbringing, but also our children&#39;s baggage of <br/>\ntheir 8 and 4 years of living in a house that was somewhat <br/>\ncontrolling and also included/includes the pain of mental illness <br/>\nissues, physical health issues, child death, and complicated grief.  <br/>\nWe are really only &#39;just now&#39; getting back on our feet as a <br/>\nfamily...restated...I am only &#39;just now&#39; showing signs of recovery <br/>\nand feeling able to make these changes toward freedom...but it&#39;s a <br/>\nvery quick and slippery step for me to find myself back with trauma <br/>\nand stress issues.  (We&#39;ve all got our stuff...I don&#39;t think for a <br/>\nminute there are many families unschooling out there who have not <br/>\nbeen touched by some sort of issue...I&#39;m just alluding to some of <br/>\nours.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m writing WAY too much.  Sorry.  Seems I&#39;ve let the proverbial <br/>\ncork out of the bottle!  LMAO!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line for me is...today I need to hear it&#39;s OK.  That if <br/>\nwe keep moving toward freedom we will not end up with -- to quote <br/>\nthe tape playing in my head at times -- spoiled-rotten, ungrateful, <br/>\nrude and self-centered (as in selfish) children.  That responding <br/>\nwith kindness when my nearly 4 year old demands in what can be <br/>\nconsidered a very rude way for an item at the dinner table I&#39;m not --<br/>\na quote again-- creating a monster?  That when I ask for some help <br/>\ncleaning up a mess in the house, one made by the 4 year old in <br/>\nparticular in this instance, and am told NO (sharply too, geez!) I&#39;m <br/>\nnot, again, creating a kid who will always be inconsiterate?  And my <br/>\npersonal favorite...how do I stop feeling like &quot;I&#39;m the only one who <br/>\ndoes anything around here?&quot;  That&#39;s an oldie, but goodie tape that <br/>\nstarts up pretty easily when I&#39;m tired...I&#39;ll go happily along for <br/>\ndays counting the blessings in cleaning up, taking care of others, <br/>\netc. and then all of a sudden wham!  I feel totally taken advantage <br/>\nof, over worked and under appreciated and that darn it, don&#39;t I <br/>\ndeserve some common courtesy?  Really...is it too much to ask for <br/>\nthe family to pick up after themselves?  I know...I hit a hot button <br/>\n(for the list as well as myself).  I&#39;m not saying anyone here is <br/>\nwrong...I&#39;m just sharing my struggle in trying to move in a more <br/>\nfree direction.  I&#39;m revealing my doubts in the hopes those here <br/>\nwith more experience can shine the light a little further along the <br/>\ntunnel for me.  I&#39;m not here to bash you or judge what you are <br/>\ndoing.... I&#39;m here for some help with dealing with the voices and <br/>\ntapes of the past, both mine and those of my kids during this <br/>\ntransition.  <br/>\n<br/>\n*So*... <br/>\n<br/>\nAre you sure???  Really????  Is it true???<br/>\nResponding to rudeness, destruction, physical aggression, etc. with <br/>\nkindess really, really, really will turn out OK?  Gosh this sounds <br/>\nSO dumb when I actually type it...  Am I correct in thinking that we <br/>\nare in a de-schooling period as we unlearn a more &quot;time-out&quot; style <br/>\nof parenting?  Is what feels like &quot;taking advantage&quot; really just <br/>\ngetting a fill of a need that wasn&#39;t being met? There&#39;s listening, <br/>\nand talking, there&#39;s modeling...but there&#39;s also nagging doubt, <br/>\nexhaustion and frustration on my end.   Will this all be OK?  (Note: <br/>\nI&#39;ve read Rue&#39;s book, been lurking here since the conference in <br/>\nPeabody which I attended, and have been reading Naomi Aldert&#39;s <br/>\narticles.)<br/>\n <br/>\nI probably haven&#39;t spent nearly enough time re-reading and editing <br/>\nthis post for clarity or stupidity, but my kids need me to get <br/>\nmyself dressed and ready for a doctor&#39;s appointment they scheduled <br/>\nfor themselves today.  And, I&#39;m anxious to send it.  So, I&#39;m off...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any hand-holding that may come from this -- <br/>\nand/or constructive butt-kicking which I realize is also an option, <br/>\nlmao!<br/>\n<br/>\nAimee in Connecticut<br/>\nsharing life with Paul (DH), Emma (newly 8) and Annie (nearly 4)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It is never too late to be what you might have been.&quot; ~~George <br/>\nEliot <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;unschooler, n : one who learns from life and love and great books <br/>\nand late morning conversations and big projects and eccentric uncles <br/>\nand mountains and mistakes and volunteering and starry nights...&quot; <br/>\n~~From a t-shirt found at: www.lowryhousepublishers.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15081,"nextTopicId":15146}}
