We do not post often, but when we<br/>\ndo, it is something we truly need guidance with.  If we really knew how to<br/>\ndeal with this and were not prepared for input then we should have never<br/>\nposted.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter you wrote, &quot;There is no line&quot;.  I thought, &quot; We know this one&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that it is more that she gets frustrated with me, not that she does<br/>\nnot want me playing it.  So, with your thoughts on this, I have decided to<br/>\ndevote more of my time (the whole scramble brain thing...I&#39;ll have to work<br/>\non and with), to getting in there and playing away.   That whole paragraph<br/>\nwas good for us to hear.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did have PS2 in our main room until about a week ago.  We purchased her a<br/>\nTV and put it in her room.  The reason being is that we use that room to<br/>\nwatch TV, read, basically, do everything in.  It made it a little hard with<br/>\nthe PS2 on most of the time for anyone else to have their choice in the<br/>\nroom.  We did not want to ask her to stop playing, so we could have a TV<br/>\nturn, read, etc. so figured another TV was the answer.   Hmm, maybe not.<br/>\nMaybe we should have that TV in the same room?   HMMM, again.  Sooo trying<br/>\nto make the right decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, THAT BOX does get us sometimes.  You really would not believe how<br/>\nfar we have come.  If you only knew....we were classical curriculum, stern<br/>\nparenters. Ohhh yeah...really sad.  We are very happy to have literally<br/>\nhalted and made a u-turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny part about your comment on, &quot;it seems like you and him&quot;, is that<br/>\nwe feel like everything is revolving around our sweetie.  LOL...and it<br/>\nshould be. Sooo, that one is a real eye-opener!  I mean this is a good way.<br/>\nMy eyes are now truly open to looking at the WHOLE picture here.   On these<br/>\nlist, and we are on several, it amazes me the insight some of you have.  I<br/>\nguess we are just at the beginning of this journey and of detoxing<br/>\nourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe really like your suggestion on the bike ride thing.  See, it is just<br/>\nabout being creative.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that we are not guilt-tripping her.  We know this is our deal.  I<br/>\nthink that makes it even harder.  We really have to look into ourselves, our<br/>\nlives, our past, and our wants for all of our futures.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was rereading some topics in Rue&#39;s book last night and something struck me<br/>\n(well, the whole darn thing, strikes me..haha).  On page 58, bottom<br/>\nparagraph she says, &quot;Do our children ever choose to watch something that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t enjoy?  Yes.  I sometimes watch things they don&#39;t enjoy as well.  We<br/>\nare different people and will surely have different opinions and interests<br/>\nfrom time to time.  It is important not to let your own opinions negate<br/>\nanother person&#39;s.  The fact that I don&#39;t find enjoyment in a certain program<br/>\ndoes not give me the right to interfere with someone else&#39;s enjoyment.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though this deals with TV, it really struck me with the PS2.  When<br/>\nSorscha and I went to bed, I decided to &quot;try and get&quot; the whole PS2 thing.<br/>\nWhat she basically said was this, &quot;Mom, it&#39;s like when YOU read a book.<br/>\nThere are all these chapters and in each chapter there are all these levels.<br/>\nEach chapter has characters, and clues.  It&#39;s like in your book how you need<br/>\nto know the definition of each word.  I need to know each character and<br/>\nclue.  There&#39;s no story without all of this&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe then went on to say that she plays them over and over because she is<br/>\nstriving for mastery of each one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO BASICALLY I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT!!! Haha.  She has a plan, a goal, and<br/>\nobviously and understanding of her wants.  And even if she did not, I think<br/>\nthat we have crossed this hurdle and are okay and willing to be much (MUCH)<br/>\nmore creative as parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sooo glad we emailed.  I feel like we received a ton of great advise.<br/>\nThanks everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Millers in New Mexico<br/>\n++++++++++++++++<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Message: 21<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 28 Sep 2005 17:51:28 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: Pamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: PS2...missing kidlet<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It comes across as sincere, to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is no &quot;line.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You live and flow and things happen and sometimes your life revolves<br/>\n&gt; around a child&#39;s favorite activity and sometimes you&#39;re busy in all<br/>\n&gt; kinds of activities and sometimes you&#39;re not busy at anything much<br/>\n&gt; and other times a kid follows you around the house while you do<br/>\n&gt; laundry and wipe counters and tells you ABOUT what they did in their<br/>\n&gt; video game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a little concerned about the comments that she doesn&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; playing with you because you&#39;re not very good at it and also that you<br/>\n&gt; just don&#39;t LIKE playing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You have a rough future ahead for you unless you learn to find<br/>\n&gt; pleasure and enjoyment in things your child is passionate about.

Lots of games are more fun with more<br/>\n&gt; people. You should see my kids - the PS2 is in our bedroom in front<br/>\n&gt; of our king-size waterbed - so all three kids will be piled up - all<br/>\n&gt; over each other - on the waterbed, cheering, waiting to play the<br/>\n&gt; winner, giving pointers, playing together.
