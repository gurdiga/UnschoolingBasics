The big thing was the bedtime routine where the boys needed Daddy to lay beside each of them in order for them to fall asleep (Nanny made the parents let them cry it out); and the way the child named Seth was ending up left out of rough play with his dad and brothers (although apparently unintentionally), because he has Spina Bifida and a heart condition they didn&#39;t name. So the Nanny made certain that the Dad took time to be with Seth alone. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;ve never watched the show before; and I missed the beginning few minutes of it.

I saw the second half<br/>\nof it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was sad that the dad enjoyed lying with his kids while they<br/>\nfell asleep and the nanny thought it was so wrong. She felt he was doing it<br/>\nout of his own insecurities but he said he was doing it because he never<br/>\nwent to be feeling safe and loved and he wanted his kids to have the feeling<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t have as a kid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought that was valid. It wasn&#39;t like he was needy and they weren&#39;t. They<br/>\nwere just little boys and they needed their dad as much as he needed them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nApparently though it wasn&#39;t working for the mom because she wanted alone<br/>\ntime with her dh after the kids were in bed and when he put them to bed, she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t get that.  Too bad she couldn&#39;t get the time she needs with her dh<br/>\nanother time and let the dad have that time with his kids that they all<br/>\nseemed to enjoy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids love those shows and I have to say I find them intriguing in a way<br/>\nbut they make me crazy at the same time. I do have to say though that the<br/>\nfamilies that are usually on there have improved relationships after the<br/>\nnanny helps.  It&#39;s just that they have SO MUCH further to go to get to a<br/>\nrespectful relationship and that is never addressed.  The punishment and<br/>\nreward system seems to be the be all end all.  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196291069,"authorName":"Daniel MacIntyre","from":"Daniel MacIntyre &lt;daniel.macintyre@...&gt;","profile":"macintyred","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Anyone catch Nanny 911 yesterday?","postDate":"1135104226","msgId":8456,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxMmNiNDRlMDUxMjIwMTA0M3IxYTViZDZlbDYwNjJjZGMzMjMxNjhjMzZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDFjNC4zNmQ0YWVmNS4zMGQ5YTgyZEBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFjNC4zNmQ0YWVmNS4zMGQ5YTgyZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8455,"nextInTopic":8457,"prevInTime":8455,"nextInTime":8457,"topicId":8453,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I blogged on it, but I was coming in and out myself.
