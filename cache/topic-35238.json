We&#39;re discussing ideas. If you&#39;ve thrown an  <br/>\nidea onto the list that only works with the personalities in your  <br/>\nhome, it&#39;s not useful to the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy family can probably do more teasing than some families. I don&#39;t  <br/>\nadvocate teasing. It&#39;s not a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and times when it is OK to speak your mind<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is an aspect where the conversation seems to go wrong. You&#39;re  <br/>\nsaying that &quot;I don&#39;t like that show because of x, y, and z.&quot; is not  <br/>\nspeaking your mind, but saying &quot;That&#39;s dumb,&quot; is.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s some more where you&#39;re saying people *aren&#39;t* doing this who  <br/>\naren&#39;t using judgmental words:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Actually, quite the opposite. I think it frees them to decide what  <br/>\n&gt; they like for themselves. With or without my enthusiasm.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter neither needs my enthusiasm or approval to like   <br/>\nsomething. And she&#39;s achieved that without hearing me call things I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t like stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Nobody HAS to watch what the other wants to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No one does in our house, either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We went through the things where I pretended to be interested when  <br/>\n&gt; they were very young.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I *showed* interest in her interests. I did things she liked that I  <br/>\nwas indifferent to (and let my husband handle the things I really  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like). I don&#39;t remember pretending interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And watching TV around here has always been an interactive activity  <br/>\n&gt; anyway. We have always sliced and diced ads, for instance.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As do we. But we don&#39;t need to call things dumb to have a  <br/>\nconversation. Dumb and stupid -- in general, perhaps not in your  <br/>\nfamily -- can be conversation stoppers. What does one say to &quot;That&#39;s  <br/>\ndumb&quot;? &quot;No, it&#39;s not.&quot;? It&#39;s helpful to get kids to draw out what  <br/>\nthey like and don&#39;t like. Dumb doesn&#39;t really communicate anything.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s a vague word whose meaning is specific to the person using it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s not meant for your family. It&#39;s meant for anyone who is  <br/>\nstill reading along and hadn&#39;t ever really thought about it. (Or had  <br/>\nconversations stopped by &quot;That was good.&quot; or &quot;That was stupid.&quot; and  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know why.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t know -- we just aren&#39;t required to assign value to things  <br/>\n&gt; because the other person likes it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And no one is saying that either. There are so many ideas you&#39;re  <br/>\npulling out of the suggestion that there are better ways to  <br/>\ncommunicate than judgmental words that just aren&#39;t part of what is  <br/>\ngoing on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But he knows, as the kids know, that the disdain is for the game --  <br/>\n&gt; or those cars all driving very fast while turning left, what the  <br/>\n&gt; heck is entertaining about that! -- and not him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And it&#39;s very helpful for kids out in the world to realize that some  <br/>\npeople *do* feel judged when what they like is judged negatively.  <br/>\nWithout that awareness those kids are going to hurt without realizing  <br/>\nit. And it won&#39;t help those kids if the attitude is that people can  <br/>\nbe dismissed as &quot;too sensitive&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying you&#39;re family isn&#39;t aware.
