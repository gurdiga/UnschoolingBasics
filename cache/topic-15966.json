I found that what worked best and most often for me was an adaptation of _How to talk so kids really listen and listen so kids will talk_.  First, name the feeling.  &quot;You sound angry.&quot;.  Then say nothing.  Hopefully, Andrew will tell you more.  If not, wait a reasonable amoutn of time and try again.  As he speaks, be sure to listen.  Use &quot;oh&quot;, &quot;I see&quot;, and &quot;hmm&quot; as he speaks.  These convey that you are listening but does not convey agreement.  When Andrew is finished speaking, you might choose to paraphase what he said, &quot;So you&#39;re saying that...&quot;.  That may cue him to tell you more, to complete a thought.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  When I used this I found that I unearthed something that I might not have gotten if I didn&#39;t use it and/or it helped my diffuse my son.    <br/>\n<br/>\n  I give you credit for pointing out that the request was reasonable, etc.  Who says you can&#39;t think on the fly??  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Is there ever a time when Andrew does this when you can talk to him about it?  Maybe tomorrow, a few days later?  I also found that if I left it alone and tried again at a later time, I got some of the answers I needed.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  HTH some!!<br/>\n  Jane<br/>\n  <br/>\nTina &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zoocrew@...\">zoocrew@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          I&#39;ve posted here about our son, Andrew-14, before but haven&#39;t gotten <br/>\nany responses.
