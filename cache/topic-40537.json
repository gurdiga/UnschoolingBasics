It certainly can be...  some days may be very focused on these two qualities, but as a whole it seems problematic and misleading to describe it this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people who (whom?  I never know when to use that) I do not respect.  There are things I do not accept.  Unschooling isn&#39;t an &quot;anything goes,&quot; type of lifestyle.

Living the way we do has allowed my children the chance to be discerning in their choices of who and what to respect and accept.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really hoping this makes sense.
