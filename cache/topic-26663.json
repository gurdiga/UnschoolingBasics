Last Sunday I took my kids plus a couple others (ranging from 19 months to 14 years old) to a &quot;hike and a movie&quot;.  What they did is take us on a short walk looked where we could find bugs and insects .  The guide talked specifically on what makes something an insect and had the kids carry some paper bags when we got to a stomp she had them 1 by one open their bags and she explained the life cycle of the ant.  Now that may still too schoolish but I thought it was really fun -- plus afterwards we went for another walk.   which was good for all of us..:)  now the 14 year olds kind of hung around but they were free to go whereever they wanted ..
