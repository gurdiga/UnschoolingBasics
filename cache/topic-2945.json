That&#39;s really sad to me.  :(<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I would get my HEM,  that was the first column I would turn to.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe has been such a guiding force in my journey of home education.  I can&#39;t tell you guys how her writings have helped me.   In the beginning,  when I had tons of questions, she would be on unschoolingdiscussion lists and on the message boards.   It was then so cool to turn to HEM and read her column.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was really trying to decide if I was going to renew my subscription of not.  Mostly because it didn&#39;t seem very unschooly.  I do remember about 6 months ago where there were 2 other articles that were about unschoolers.  It was great!  But, as of late the only unschooling thing in it had been Sandra&#39;s column.
