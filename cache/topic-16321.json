Are they<br/>\nwanting to stay up, or happily laying down with you? <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my big thing, is having a certain TIME for bed is less<br/>\nimportant than helping people sleep when they&#39;re tired. If everyone is<br/>\nhappy, not asking to stay up, maybe don&#39;t rock the boat too much just<br/>\nyet.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt depends.<br/>\nIf it hits that &quot;calm down&quot; time of the evening and someone is engaged<br/>\nand wants to keep at the activity, is the bedtime more important or<br/>\nthe activity?  If you&#39;re being open to helping them continue any<br/>\nactivities they might choose, rather than putting your quiet/alone<br/>\ntime ahead of their needs (not that your needs don&#39;t matter) then I&#39;d<br/>\nsay don&#39;t worry about it so much. Maybe everyone is tired about the<br/>\nsame time each night for now...just be open to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone in our household has a different sleep pattern these days.<br/>\nBeing open to change and flow is the best way to adapt as children<br/>\ngrow older and more autnonomous. You can still find ways to enjoy time<br/>\ntogether as a couple, you just have to get more creative at certain<br/>\nphases in life. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16196,"nextTopicId":16312}}
