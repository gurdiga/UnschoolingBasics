We&#39;ve had  <br/>\nseveral crabs, my son&#39;s favorite pets were a couple of two inch crabs  <br/>\nnamed Hermie and Hermie (original, I know).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most interesting aspects of hermit crabs is the way they  <br/>\ngrow. As arthropods, they have an hard outer shell that they shed as  <br/>\nthey outgrow. As hermit crabs however, they differ from other crabs  <br/>\nin that they do not have a complete exoskeleton. Instead, their  <br/>\nelongated bodies are soft and must be protected by adopting abandoned  <br/>\nsnail shells. We&#39;ve spent many hours watching the crabs scuttle  <br/>\naround, and laughed at their antics. We&#39;ve spent probably as much  <br/>\ntime concerned when they fell off the climbing wall we built, or  <br/>\nfeeding them, bathing them or watering their sponges.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe twist comes in the fact that a predator cannot force a hermit  <br/>\ncrab out of it&#39;s shell. The tail has four evolved legs that grip onto  <br/>\nthe shell. If pulled, the hermit crab will be torn apart before it  <br/>\nwill allow itself to be removed from the shell. If you have a crab as  <br/>\na pet, you must provide shells for the crab to choose from. Because  <br/>\nthe hermit crab is so particular about his shell, you must provide  <br/>\nseveral shells of various shapes and sizes from which he can pick.  <br/>\nThen you step back and assume that nature will take it&#39;s course.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe analogy can be made to unschooling. We cannot force our  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s interest, we cannot force them to learn. We can respect  <br/>\nthem for who they are. We can place interesting resources and  <br/>\nopportunities around them. We help, providing food and shelter, trust  <br/>\nand love.
