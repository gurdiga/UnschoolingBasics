If Payge and Damien are playing<br/>\n&gt;  and Payge accidentally pulls Damien too hard and he gets hurt, I go<br/>\n&gt;  silent. I walk over pick up my son and comfort him. Then after a<br/>\n&gt;  moment, when the initial frustration has passed I ease back into<br/>\n&gt;  speaking. This period of silence helps me regroup, and avoid saying<br/>\n&gt;  something I&#39;d regret. When I start speaking I&#39;ll ask Damien if he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  okay. We&#39;ll talk about how Payge was having so much fun playing, that<br/>\n&gt;  she didn&#39;t recognize her own strength. At this point we&#39;re usually<br/>\n&gt;  all gathered together talking about what happened, and how we can try<br/>\n&gt;  to make it so it doesn&#39;t happen again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I know that discussing it may be difficult since Morgan&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  communication is still blossoming. If you can remember before<br/>\n&gt;  reacting to just stay silent till you are calmer (even 30 seconds can<br/>\n&gt;  make a big difference) it helps a lot. In your moment of silence<br/>\n&gt;  still go and comfort the dog.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Kendrah:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30653,"nextTopicId":31076}}
