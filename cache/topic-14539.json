(we&#39;d already had multiple conversations<br/>\nand <br/>\nexperiences where he knew he could say no.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we sat on the beach and I told him about haiku.

That was it for quite a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next writing experience was quite a few months later. The church we<br/>\nwent <br/>\nto had a mouse problem.
