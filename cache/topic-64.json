What do you do for record keeping and such things?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI treat High School the same as any other age. We help them have <br/>\naccess to information and tools they need, but they follow their <br/>\ninterests and learn from living! Joy and passion are the best <br/>\nmotivators for human beings at ANY age, wouldn&#39;t you agree?<br/>\nAs far as record keeping, I am starting to log some things for my <br/>\noldest son, Trevor, this year.

Have you <br/>\nconsidered the fact that many, many very happily successful people <br/>\nnever go to college, but find other ways to do the things they love?<br/>\nFor some, college is a useful tool, but ONLY that...a tool.<br/>\nFor my children, I want their toolbox to be rich and varied, full of <br/>\nthings like creativity, individualism, self-confidence, joy of <br/>\nlearning etc....:) There are so many unconventional ways to find <br/>\nwork you love...for now though, let them just BE.<br/>\nTheir job right now is to be kids, to have fun and learn what they <br/>\nlove.
