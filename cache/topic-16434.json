Because when I think about my children at two it really is more about distraction and at times a passive, &quot;please don&#39;t hit.&quot; is what would happen.  As they get older I may say that hitting hurts if my child is insistent on hitting after distraction does not work.<br/>\n<br/>\nYea, I am a distractor more than anything.  Even at 3, I still use distraction and avoid saying, &quot;Don&#39;t do xyz.&quot;  because saying don&#39;t do something sets my three year old off even more.  So when my 6 yr old says that the 3 yr old is hitting him, I will say, &quot;Kamau, will you come in here with Mommy?&quot; or &quot;Kamau, would you like to get something to drink?&quot;  I only go into explanation when he is determined to keep hitting and even then I try to keep a very cool approach.  I guess I kind of talk him down by saying, &quot;Why do you want to hit your brother?  Did he make you angry?  Are you frustrated?  What can I do for you?&quot;  When I articulate what the problem is his insistence on hitting goes away effortlessly.  And this is at THREE!  So at two it it is even more beneficial to just distract.  The mother who started this question, I cannot remember who the child is hitting but I do know that at times we as parents can feel bad for our child hurting another.  I never make my children apologize, although they do so on their own often.  But, if my child is not yet at the place to apologize or doesn&#39;t feel led to, I just apologize for the hurt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the clarification, Ren.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nTyra<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: 2006/08/10 Thu AM 08:43:38 CDT<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] a toddler question<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Repetition is the mother of skill....you just keep telling him and<br/>\none day he  will really get it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell yes, and no.<br/>\nRepetition IS part of parenting.
