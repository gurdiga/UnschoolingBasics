Imh expert opinion, that&#39;s what I think it boils down to -- that he&#39;s looking for what&#39;s next.  I became a tad bit too bogged down in getting through the day to day with all parties surviving and avoiding incoming attacks, that I really didn&#39;t thoroughly sit down and think until yesterday.  Turns out, Christopher was an AVID gamer up until we bought the last game, then he went cold turkey. Done!!  I *do* think he&#39;s looking for something new, and we&#39;ll just keep sticking things in his way until we find something he likes.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t mind hunting, searching, et al, but I *do* mind the getting there!!  Hopefully this will get easier the further we go along!!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks again!!<br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJane Powell <br/>\nTribe Commander <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;If you bungle raising your children, I don&#39;t think anything you do well matters very much.&quot;   Jackie O <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;You must be the change you wish to see in the world.&quot; - Gandhi <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;The most wasted day is that in which we have not laughed.&quot; - Sebastien-Roch Chamfort<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nHow low will we go?
