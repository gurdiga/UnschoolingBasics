I&#39;ve improved (miraculously) about the junk food on the side. It&#39;s only happened this week, actually, when I looked at how rediculous I look sneaking junk food on the side so my son won&#39;t see it and ask for what I prefer his body not ingest. If it&#39;s not good for him, why the heck am I stuffing my face with it? I made a rule for myself : If I grab a handfull of chocolate morsels, I take one to my son. If I make a bowl of icecream, I get him one, too. I&#39;ve lost 5 lbs this week ! <br/>\n  We still have the issue of what my DH affectionately calls &#39;the Lisa syndrome&#39;, whereby each time we leave the house, I am suddenly starving and want to stop by a fast food place. I&#39;m better, but my son has LS now! I haven&#39;t implemented anything yet, but I think I&#39;ll start packing a fun snack for when we leave the house. He loves the YoBaby&#39;s &#39;YoKids&#39; organic yogurt in the pouches. Let me tell you, THAT alone has changed my son&#39;s daily request for snacks. He usually would beg for a cookie or icecream anytime he was hungry (for a long time that was how he expressed hunger), but now he wants yoghurt. It&#39;s all in the packaging, and he thinks he&#39;s getting away with something! <br/>\n  Anyway, good luck! I hope you find a solution that works for you. If so, let me know...maybe it&#39;ll help here, too! <br/>\n  Lisa O<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren Ahern &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gktbdm@...\">gktbdm@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I admit to learning the same thing over the<br/>\n&gt; years...most everything that frustrated me was really about ME.

I received a few replies from some of you here and I just wanted<br/>\nto pop in and say thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I posted about my frustration and my feelings of sending everyone to<br/>\nFT daycare so I could get myself back together on a Thursday.by Saturday I<br/>\nwas in bed with a mother case of mastitis.  By the time Monday came around I<br/>\nstill felt like crap and my oldest had a case of Strep that had been treated<br/>\nwith antibiotics and was still on day 17.he already has a heart murmur so<br/>\nyou can imagine my level of fear and stress!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was too ill to get him to the dr so dh took him - found out it was not<br/>\nstrep afterall and I was on the mend by Tuesday.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI posted here during the peak of my frustration (so I thought) but it<br/>\nactually got worse.  I had plenty of time to reflect on the posts I received<br/>\nhere and I also had some time to just &quot;be&quot; and reflect on everything.<br/>\nHonestly the mastitis came at the perfect time (doesn&#39;t it always?).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I did to get back on track.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n#1)went from about 1 pot of strong coffee per day to NO COFFEEEEEEE!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not realize my caffeine consumption was a problem.  For me it produces<br/>\nlots of energy but it was a type of energy that is not productive when<br/>\ntrying to be patient and calm.  It was mopre of a &quot;gotta go gotta go&quot; type<br/>\nof energy that resulted in lots and lots of cleaning as if I were in a<br/>\ncleaning race yet I was never able to finish the race which led to lots of<br/>\nfrustration and not enough &quot;be&quot;ing with my kids during the day.  I think the<br/>\ncoffee was feeding my feelings of dh getting to be the fun parent as I would<br/>\nbust ass being productive all day and then he would come home and get<br/>\ntackled for playtime.while I picked up the kitchen!<br/>\n<br/>\n I felt that I was spending time with my kids.we were together all day,<br/>\nrushing to playdates and dance/gym classes and running to other social<br/>\nengagements but not enough time just laying about and seeing which project<br/>\nwould naturally come up next. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course the caffeine probably didn&#39;t help my mastits either so that is a<br/>\nthing of the past for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always been a coffee girl, even during my pregnancies and since I&#39;ve<br/>\nbirthed big fat healthy babies who sleep well and are not often fussy I<br/>\nassumed we were in good shape.  You can&#39;t really tell until you get off the<br/>\nhard stuff that it is really not good for gentle parenting.even if everyone<br/>\nsleeps well inspite of it, it is still not ideal.  So that&#39;s that.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n#2) kobe and I have spent more alone time together and have talked a lot<br/>\nmore.  I see an awakening in her and it has really been beautiful.  Now,<br/>\nwhen she needs ore attention - she flat out asks for it.  I am so proud of<br/>\nher.  She has expressed to me that all she wants to do is just chill out<br/>\nwith me.  I am so happy that she can just tell me now vs a few weeks ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI could elaborate more but I think I will leave it at this.  Most of her<br/>\nissues that I posted here a few weeks ago were actually my issues, and mine<br/>\nalone.  I am so thankful for that bout of mastits because without it I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink I would have had the time or shall I say taken the time to mull it all<br/>\nover.  We all know what causes mastits but for some reason I really didn&#39;t<br/>\nsee it coming.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to thank all of you for your insight and for taking time to<br/>\nshare with me - it has literally been life changing.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nXo<br/>\n<br/>\nGeneva<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24896,"nextTopicId":24914}}
