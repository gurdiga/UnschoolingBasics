Life <br/>\nwill<br/>\npresent it&#39;s own natural limitations.  Family situations will sometimes<br/>\npresent natural limitations.   Location can present natural limitations to<br/>\nsomething a kid might want to do.   Kids don&#39;t need arbitrary limitations<br/>\nplaced on them by people who are thoughtlessly passing down the &quot;who do you<br/>\nthink you are?&quot; legacy of parenting.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, natural limitation will often allow for not using the word,&quot;No.&quot;. But <br/>\nusing the word, &quot;No.&quot; doesn&#39;t always have to be arbitrary.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children have asked me on occasion to just give them an answer. They can <br/>\nget exhausted<br/>\nby my desire to explore, or have them explore, every option. Sometimes they <br/>\nwant to just have someone give them an answer and be &quot;lazy&quot; about things. I <br/>\ncan relate to this and see no harm in it.<br/>\n<br/>\n***And kids don&#39;t need to hear &quot;no&quot; so they can learn to say &quot;no.&quot;   Kid&#39;s <br/>\nneed<br/>\nto have their choices respected.  It&#39;s that simple.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they never hear it, I find it hard to believe they will ever learn to say <br/>\nit and use it when<br/>\nit is exactly what they mean.<br/>\n<br/>\n***They need to be free to NOT hug Aunt Martha, to NOT wave bye-bye to Mr. <br/>\nJones, to NOT kiss Grandpa,to NOT have to stay at Grandma&#39;s if they don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to.  They need to be<br/>\nfree to listen to their own instincts about people and places and they need<br/>\nto be able to say &quot;no&quot; to foods they don&#39;t like, and ideas they don&#39;t agree<br/>\nwith.  That&#39;s how they will have the confidence to say &quot;no&quot; when they are<br/>\nolder.***<br/>\n<br/>\nAunt Martha and the rest of the family may need to hear ,&quot;No.&quot;. Again, if <br/>\nchildren don&#39;t<br/>\nlearn to hear it used in the appropriate context, they won&#39;t know to use it <br/>\nthat way.<br/>\nMost people are not familiar with the autonomous, unschooled ideas. My <br/>\nchildren<br/>\nhave learned that most people have to be spoken to in a language they<br/>\nunderstand. And,&quot;No.&quot; is part of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Equating unschooling with neglect is not helpful.   Parents who leave <br/>\nkids<br/>\non their own, to figure things out for themselves and who are not examples<br/>\nof thoughtful, honest maturity are not unschooling.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI never even implied that they were neglectful, that comment was in poor <br/>\ntaste.<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t left on my own to figure things out for myself at all times. But <br/>\nsometimes<br/>\nthe natural consequences were the best teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Unschooling parents need to be involved with their kids, to be helpful <br/>\nand empowering so that<br/>\nlong before their kids are out on their own they have the skills they need<br/>\nto get along well.   Those skills are developed in a home where parents are<br/>\nexamples of good decision making and thoughtful consideration of others.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about how often a kid hears &quot;no.&quot;***<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n***This site is by a bunch of folks whose baseline is schooled kids.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re<br/>\nstarting from a population who&#39;s psychology has already been altered by<br/>\nschool.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree.

If <br/>\nyour child wets the bed you would say &quot;if you have  this glass of water right <br/>\nnow it may make things hard for you later  if you feel like peeing at night&quot; <br/>\nand then let the child decide. No kid  WANTS to wet their bed. After they <br/>\nunderstand how the water thing relates  to the wet bed they will figure out on <br/>\ntheir own how to get it  together. But if your child wants to run around the <br/>\npool, play in the  street at night or put mouthfuls of sand from the sandbox in  <br/>\ntheir mouth then no is always a good option with an explanation after  of <br/>\ncourse. I have met my share of overly relaxed parents who don&#39;t  say no to these <br/>\nthings and suffer terrible consequences both in terms of  safety and anti-social <br/>\nbehavior later in life. Boundaries, especially put  in place for safety, are <br/>\nvery loving. I also don&#39;t think a parent should  say yes to things that will <br/>\ncause their life to become terrible  just for the sake of their child feeling <br/>\nfree. For example, I have to work  extremely early on Sunday morning and need <br/>\nthe house quiet and calm and  everyone asleep fairly early Sat night. Any other <br/>\nnight and they can stay  up all night long as far as I&#39;m concerned and sleep <br/>\nall  afternoon, but if I get unhealthy from not sleeping and worn  down and <br/>\nsick, what good am I to my kids? So Sat night I tell them  when they have to be <br/>\nin bed and more importantly WHY and because they love  me, they respect it and <br/>\nwant what is best for the whole family. On rare  occasion there will be some <br/>\nresistance because of a great science  show that&#39;s on or a game they don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to stop playing, but I say no,  albeit gently - if I didn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nrespecting myself and  my health or them!

Children are showered in negativity from their <br/>\nparents and other adults who believe children must be made to understand the <br/>\nworld is tough, life is hard and you can&#39;t have everything you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we&#39;ve had generation after generation of children raised that way and <br/>\nnow we have a citizenry of depressed, disordered, unhappy, dysfunctional <br/>\nmiserable people.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Kids and adults need to hear no from others and also, maybe more<br/>\nimportantly, need to know the freedom of being able to say no. And if we<br/>\nwant the freedom to say it, we need to accept the reality that we&#39;ll hear<br/>\nit.***<br/>\n<br/>\nKids don&#39;t need to hear &quot;No&quot; so that they can learn about life.   Life will <br/>\npresent it&#39;s own natural limitations.  Family situations will sometimes <br/>\npresent natural limitations.   Location can present natural limitations to <br/>\nsomething a kid might want to do.   Kids don&#39;t need arbitrary limitations <br/>\nplaced on them by people who are thoughtlessly passing down the &quot;who do you <br/>\nthink you are?&quot; legacy of parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd kids don&#39;t need to hear &quot;no&quot; so they can learn to say &quot;no.&quot;   Kid&#39;s need <br/>\nto have their choices respected.  It&#39;s that simple.  They need to be free to <br/>\nNOT hug Aunt Martha, to NOT wave bye-bye to Mr. Jones, to NOT kiss Grandpa, <br/>\nto NOT have to stay at Grandma&#39;s if they don&#39;t want to.  They need to be <br/>\nfree to listen to their own instincts about people and places and they need <br/>\nto be able to say &quot;no&quot; to foods they don&#39;t like, and ideas they don&#39;t agree <br/>\nwith.  That&#39;s how they will have the confidence to say &quot;no&quot; when they are <br/>\nolder.<br/>\n<br/>\n***This is one of the things I learned in my own unschool life.   My parents<br/>\nnever said no. I had a very hard time saying no to anyone, and when I<br/>\nstarted trying to assert myself, I used it to harshly. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nEquating unschooling with neglect is not helpful.   Parents who leave kids <br/>\non their own, to figure things out for themselves and who are not examples <br/>\nof thoughtful, honest maturity are not unschooling.   Unschooling parents <br/>\nneed to be involved with their kids, to be helpful and empowering so that <br/>\nlong before their kids are out on their own they have the skills they need <br/>\nto get along well.   Those skills are developed in a home where parents are <br/>\nexamples of good decision making and thoughtful consideration of others. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not about how often a kid hears &quot;no.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis site is by a bunch of folks whose baseline is schooled kids.  They&#39;re <br/>\nstarting from a population who&#39;s psychology has already been altered by <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20325,"nextTopicId":20355}}
