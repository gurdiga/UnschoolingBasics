I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t need to dress up in funny clothes to go off in the woods by myself.<br/>\n*Anyway* we&#39;ve recently gotten back involved and there is a very active<br/>\n&quot;minister of children&quot; who is very enthusiastic about doing things with the<br/>\nkids and helping them feel included.  And the majority of her ideas sink<br/>\nlike lead balloons with my kids.  They are very very schoolish in nature.<br/>\nHer latest project is to create a series of &quot;lessons&quot; for the kids to do.<br/>\nThe lesson would include a written description of an activity, project, art,<br/>\nscience or historical aspect (Mongols, French Ren., High Gothic, etc.)<br/>\nAfter the children read the lesson then they would be given a comprehension<br/>\ntest to see what they learned.  If they &quot;pass&quot; the test then they will get<br/>\nsome sort of points for &quot;Page School.&quot;   ICK!!!  This is a wonderful<br/>\norganisation that spurred me into wanting to know more about history.  Not<br/>\nbecause of tests or achievements but because I found living history<br/>\ninteresting!  This just sucks all the fun out of the organisation and makes<br/>\nit SO much more like school.  I wrote a short reply offering a different<br/>\nidea (like adults taking on &quot;students&quot; and sharing with them the things that<br/>\nthey know, learning through doing).  Instead of spending hours and hours<br/>\ncreating essentially &quot;reading comprehension tests&quot; we could create a<br/>\ndatabase of skills that the children (and adults) could reference to and<br/>\nfind someone who is doing something that they are interested in.  I even<br/>\nsnuck in a link to Sandra Dodd&#39;s website (her SCA side - which is filled<br/>\nwith lots of unschooly ideas LOL!) about teaching and learning.  She replied<br/>\nback to me and said (basically) &quot;I respect your opinion, but you are wrong<br/>\nbecause this is the way that kids learn best.&quot;  GAG!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do people take something that is enjoyable and make it so not fun?  Why<br/>\ndo people feel that the only way a person (particularly a child) can learn<br/>\nsomething is from reading something and taking a test?  I never even thought<br/>\nthat way when my kids did go to school!<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I just needed to vent somewhere that was safe.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16127,"nextTopicId":16123}}
