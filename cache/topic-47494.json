Some kids want to &quot;go to school&quot; because all their school friends have new pencils and lunchboxes right now and they want some too! Or they want to play with their friends without understanding that they may not be in the same class, or they won&#39;t get to play together as long as if they just went over to their house. Or they might want to paint on a biiiig easel but not realize they only do that one day a week. So you can talk about those things as they come up. <br/>\n<br/>\nI found it also helps if you know older kids, kids who&#39;ve been in school long enough to know how much is drudgery and would much, much rather be home playing all day. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can also help to talk about the school schedule - getting up early, not being allowed to see mommy for hours at a time, not being allowed to eat or go pee when you want. Not in a &quot;kid prison&quot; kind of way, but in terms of providing information about the world. The &quot;school is fun&quot; propaganda aimed at little kids consistently leaves out those important details, after all. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh! and some kids get excited about stories of playing on the school playground. So it can be helpful to point out how little time is spent outside. <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of this has anything to do with &quot;explaining unschooling&quot; btw. To a young child, &quot;unschooling&quot; is just life as usual - what&#39;s to explain? It&#39;s more a matter of giving information about the rest of the world as needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, look for more homeschoolers in your area.

This year I am homeschooling my two boys ages 12 and 17. The reason we decided to try this was due to economic hardships that are forcing us to relocate. It made more sense to me that I &quot;teach&quot; them than deal with the stress of starting in one place then moving and starting all over again in the new town.  This seemed especially important where my 12 yr old is concerned since he would be starting middle school and those mid-years are difficult anyway. He is also painfully shy and has low self esteem. I have tried the &quot;school way&quot; for 6 years now and everything I do to try and build him up they seem to come along and knock it all down. I went thru the whole curriculum search and acquired a few books to help me but things never felt right. Then I found this group! Yaaaaay! It was like a light bulb went off and things finally began making sense! Dont get me wrong, My school programed mind would say &quot; yeah but what about........&quot; then it would hit me that the &quot;school&quot; way is not the natural way it was just the only way I had ever known. So I totally understand why my children cant understand this concept at all. I have tried to just go about learning things with the boys that I know they enjoy and not even discuss whether it is school or not. Now my 12 year comes to me upset and feeling like he wants to go back to school because he isnt learning anything. Keep in mind this is the child I had to fight tooth and nail to do his homework. Now I am the one who is failing at &quot;teaching&quot; him anything. I know that it is mostly that he thinks a teacher standing up giving a lecture and writing a bunch of examples on the blackboard is how to learn and completing a ton of worksheets is the only way. Since I am not doing that he doesnt think he is learning.
