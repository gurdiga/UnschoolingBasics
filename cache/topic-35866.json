I&#39;m keen to hear how to otherwise address this issue. I once  <br/>\n&gt; had to tell a dear friend that she had BO, and I found it very  <br/>\n&gt; stressful to approach her. Happily, she was very receptive to knowing,  <br/>\n&gt; and asked me to please tell her any time I noticed; she bathed daily  <br/>\n&gt; and was unaware of her own BO.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kimberlee<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On 13-Sep-08, at 9:48 PM, christina abbott wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe you could offer to buy some &quot;cool&quot; body wash like Ax when you  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; are out shopping with him?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Christina, Luke & Kara<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myspace.com/lukesmyboy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;A characteristic of the normal child is that he doesn&#39;t act that  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; way very often.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; EMAILING FOR THE GREATER GOOD<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Join me<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: luvbullbreeds@...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: Sat, 13 Sep 2008 19:38:11 -0500<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Help me not fall back into old ways!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; OK...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just the facts...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; boy DOB 15 Oct 96 so just about 12. Rarely showers. Is in puberty.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Owns deodorant. Rarely uses it. Has BO. What do I do?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I *mostly* leave him alone about it. Can&#39;t figure out a way to say  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;hey I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can smell you&quot; without hurting or embarrassing him. (That kind of  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; thing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would upset me.) BUT I don&#39;t want to smell BO either. He showered  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; today<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because I had to say something. The smell was bad. I don&#39;t know how  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; long<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s been since he&#39;s showered last but it&#39;s been weeks at least. But  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; like I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; said I&#39;ve been leaving him to his own body ownership.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; SO....I can pull out the &quot;my house my rules&quot; crap and &quot;make&quot; him  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; shower and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; use deodorant. Leave him alone and we all have to smell the BO. OR?  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; SURE there are more options but I&#39;m unable to see them...likely  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; because this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is my issue. But by the same token, puberty is different for him and  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; what<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worked before does not work now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s what I told him today. That puberty does funky stuff to the  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; body<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beyond things he could see and that one of the things is a stronger  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; odor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Could be that he will take the initiative and shower daily now but I  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; doubt<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it. That&#39;s not really on his radar yet.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, help me see the way to honor him as a person but also to honor  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the way<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we want to live.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Karen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301158115,"authorName":"amberlee_b","from":"&quot;amberlee_b&quot; &lt;amberlee16@...&gt;","profile":"amberlee_b","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Help me not fall back into old ways!","postDate":"1221409188","msgId":35884,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdhamRqNCtwbm9sQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJFOUVCMkI2LUM5ODktNDJEMS04OThGLTU1RTQzQzYxNzU5N0BtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35883,"nextInTopic":35885,"prevInTime":35883,"nextInTime":35885,"topicId":35866,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"These are all great!

We call <br/>\nit PMS--pre-manhood syndrome.  It has been quite painful for him as he is growing too <br/>\nfast for his bones, muscles, etc to keep up.  He will be 13 in November and is almost as <br/>\ntall as I am.  (5&#39; 11&quot; for those curious).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t pester him, but I have mentioned a couple times that oh we are going to do <br/>\nsomething out soon, did you want to shower first?  We let him pick his deodorant (as I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t think the baby powder fresh scent was what he was looking for....)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for body wash he picked some out at Bath and Body works (if I did the Axe thing for <br/>\nhim he would turn bright red!).  His main issue with puberty is something I never had, <br/>\nacne!  He is really embarrassed by it.  We have tried a few different things, but nothing <br/>\nseems to really help, or he just forgets to use it.  I don&#39;t pester him about that either and <br/>\nhe usually chooses to wash his face once a day or so...which is better than I would have <br/>\ndone at that age.  It isn&#39;t severe acne, but enough to be a bother.  Mostly on the forehead.  <br/>\nHe wants to have his hair long, but when it is the acne gets worse, so he usually chooses <br/>\nto cut it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is so quiet about these things and rarely has questions.....we do try to bring things up <br/>\nfor him and if he is interested in discussion fine.  So as they get used to all the new odors <br/>\nand body hair we get used to finding new ways to say things without making them want to <br/>\nhide and become hermits!  (Yes mine got his moustache the beginning of spring this <br/>\nyear....aurgh!
