Unfortunately (but amusingly) HRAF isn&#39;t a particularly well organised database and he stumbled across a little piece of an ethnography that talked about how grown women within this group would often walk up to a young boy and pull on their penis and say something like &quot;with something that little how you are ever going to please a woman&quot; and men making fun of little girls flat chests not being able to feed a baby. The funny thing is, for me at least, that the story of this different<br/>\n culture, this open treatment of sex made me feel relieved about the openness with which David and I treat sex in our family. I don&#39;t pull on Simon&#39;s penis and comment on it, and no one has commented on Linnaea&#39;s potential to breastfeed given her current lack of bra size, but they watch Family Guy and recently have come to enjoy South Park (which makes me very uncomfortable) and we have open conversations about sex brought on by Leisure Suit Larry the PS2 game as well as television shows. Although for a long time Simon wouldn&#39;t say the word sex, he had to spell it saying S-E and then slashing the x into the air. I didn&#39;t tend to bring it up when he felt that shyly about the subject. And if he asked a question that would lead to a discussion about S-E hand slash I would say something like the answer might make you uncomfortable and he would choose whether to talk about it or not. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a book I read years ago by Marjorie Shostak called Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman. It is a biography of this woman Nisa as told to Marjorie Shostak. There is a scene in the book with Nisa as a young girl lying on the ground in bed next to her parents who are having sex and she pulls away a little bit. Not far &#39;cause it&#39;s cold out, but a little bit away. Reading that I can remember thinking about how bizarre it is to not know anything but books and words about sex until you have it. Not that I am suggesting that children should be in bed with parents when they are having sex, nor that children should be raised outside of their own culture&#39;s norms. I guess what I am trying to say is that a healthy outlook on sex may be one in which sex is a part of public conversation and part of what makes it public conversation in my life is the media. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been watching a BBC series with David Attenborough called Life in Cold Blood for the past few weeks. The show had a segment on a species of newt where the male courted the female and when accepted by her he would lay a sperm packet on the ground which she would walk over and pick up. It was a near sexless exchange. And it was very cool to think about how different sex can be. It was a sex cell transfer that I&#39;d never heard about before and it started some very cool conversations about sex and sexlessness and tapered off as something else came up on the show. There is balance to the discussions and the openness about sex that Simon and Linnaea experience. There is a lot of humor and intensity given the shows they like to watch. Giggidy Giggidy is a common catchphrase among friends, the cultural leveler. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think media exposure will produce the sex-crazed, amoral individuals that Larry Clark portrayed in the movie Kids. Man did that movie disturb me. I think there is more that underlines the amorality of a child than his purely superficial, in that moment, movie depicted. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===================<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I can&#39;t say I&#39;m totally uncomfortable.  What I said was &quot;I become<br/>\nvery uncomfortable when there are sexual scenes in movies and on TV<br/>\n(in regards to my son).&quot;  I think this is because he is a boy.  I<br/>\nthink I&#39;m just scared.  Scared that he won&#39;t have a healthy outlook on<br/>\nsex.  so many teenagers are the victim of an oversexed world.  It<br/>\nscares me.  But your right.  I do need to take a look at that.  I<br/>\nalso need to remember that most of my education came from public<br/>\nschool and peers.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

That&#39;s <br/>\nsomething to keep in mind. What&#39;s acceptable today can become quite <br/>\nunacceptable and illegal in just a short span of years.<br/>\n<br/>\nCuriosity needs to be satisfied; but as the child gets older, &quot;playing <br/>\ndoctor&quot; may not be the best way to acquire information.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t remember the age of the child in question; but IMO eight seems <br/>\nOK, ten seems questionable, and 12 seems too old---as a general <br/>\nrule---to be playing doctor.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Cameron was 12-ish, I got a dozen or so books from the library and <br/>\nleft them in his room. They were quite a source of laughter among his <br/>\nfriends for a while. But then, they started actually reading them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we&#39;ve never been shy about nudity in our family---or about <br/>\ndiscussing sex. Both boys seemed to naturally become more modest after <br/>\nbeing mostly naked toddlers/children. Up until Duncan was 9-ish, I <br/>\nguess, one of his best friends was a girl that used to spend the night <br/>\nregularly. They&#39;ve naturally put some distance between themselves these <br/>\nlast few years. If he&#39;d shown &quot;too much&quot; interest, we would have talked <br/>\nabout it more. The idea of sex is still icky to him as he&#39;s about to <br/>\nturn 12. Again---a few years will change that too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo---age can matter---practically as well as legally. It pays to pat <br/>\nattention and answer questions as openly and honestly as possible. <br/>\nHelping them be aware of what&#39;s socially acceptable as they age is <br/>\nGOOD.

Not that it matters.  As far as I know he doens&#39;t<br/>\nknow what sex is.  this is what I&#39;m exploring.  I know it will come up<br/>\nsoon.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think it healthy to explain that privates are privates- even when <br/>\n&gt; consensual- some states the consenual age is 16 or 18- before that <br/>\n&gt; it is illegal to have sex- not sure if that means everything before <br/>\n&gt; sex or just actual sex- <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know why, but all this talk about my child&#39;s sexuality and the<br/>\nlaw bothers me.  Maybe I just disagree with the laws.  (as usual)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would not say it is BAD just not something to do in public- my <br/>\n&gt; girls are 5 and 3 and they mostly just wear underwear at home BUT <br/>\n&gt; when visitors come over they go get clothes on because wearing your <br/>\n&gt; underwear is what you can do at home but not with friends and <br/>\n&gt; neighbors and others<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would say this is personal choice.  It&#39;s not a definite.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; if we lived in a culture where running around nude was acceptable <br/>\n&gt; then it would not be a problem- I told my daughter when she grew up <br/>\n&gt; if she wanted to live with the nudists she could - after she asked <br/>\n&gt; of boys would be there ( she knows boys pee pee bums look different <br/>\n&gt; because she had a potty training boy around) she decided that she <br/>\n&gt; would not live with the boy nudists cause they look funny. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>LOL - Cute.  They do look funny, to girls anyway.  And vice versa I&#39;m<br/>\nsure.  I&#39;ve heard little boys think girls cut it off or lost it<br/>\nsomehow.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; its not bad it is just not what we do<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; what you do not want is the girls parents making the choice of what <br/>\n&gt; is out of line- <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t really think of it that way.  and I don&#39;t want to.  I suppose<br/>\nthe reality is that the general perception is there that its the boys<br/>\nfault.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; just as boys need to know that if they are having sex and the girl <br/>\n&gt; get pregnant he does not get a choice as to what happens to the baby <br/>\n&gt; SHE does<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not ready for that yet!!!  :-)<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; did you explain to him that girls and boys should keep their clothes <br/>\n&gt; on? unless he is asking or wondering about actual sex I would just <br/>\n&gt; explain that clothes or unders should be on.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>no.  not quite in those words.  We talked more about how he felt about<br/>\nthe situation.  He ultimately came to the decision that he felt<br/>\n&quot;funny&quot; about it and didn&#39;t want to do it again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ask him if he thinks she forgot her clothes or thinks they should <br/>\n&gt; put some on- explain that you can not see her privates that the <br/>\n&gt; bubbles are her pretend clothes- explain that they want you to buy <br/>\n&gt; to lotion and it feels so good.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually I told him that some people choose not to be ashamed of their<br/>\nbodies.  I also said it was possible she was wearing a bikini.  He was<br/>\nwell aware that someone was filming her naked and that the bubbles and<br/>\nribbons were special effects.  We&#39;ve also had extensive talks about<br/>\nmarketing.  LOL  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think we are more comfortable knowing that violence is not real <br/>\n&gt; and removed from us but sexuality IS part of our lives and is real <br/>\n&gt; and does happen and where do we go with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Violence is real.  Yes maybe more removed, but it is real.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Explaining that you think the women on tv need some clothes is ok- <br/>\n&gt; explaining WHY the ads are like they are in kid terms could help<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But I don&#39;t necessarily think women on TV need clothes.  So I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nsay that.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; like what? are you going to sit down and watch porn? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ACK!  No! But he might someday.  And I&#39;d like to be prepared when it<br/>\nhappens.<br/>\n<br/>\nif he is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; watching tv ads then talk about them simple and non judgmental- so <br/>\n&gt; not saying something like &quot;those people are bad and wrong and tv is <br/>\n&gt; bad and it is disgusting&quot; that is not the same as saying &quot;gosh I <br/>\n&gt; think they lost their clothes- oh dear they need to do that in <br/>\n&gt; private opps I pushed the wrong button on the remote. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see what you mean.  but that seems a little avoidant.  we&#39;re beyond<br/>\nthat &quot;oops&quot; stage.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; your son is getting older and his boy is going to start changing <br/>\n&gt; SOON at least internally and so leaving the funny books around is <br/>\n&gt; good but also explaining that it is private is important but you are <br/>\n&gt; mom and you will answer ANY questions that he has.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, I will.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m here for help.  *sigh*  Hopefully it<br/>\nwill get easier, as I&#39;m pregnant with boy #3.  ;-)<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; mine either but for some reason I am the person all my younger <br/>\n&gt; siblings came to for sex answers so I learned quickly to find the <br/>\n&gt; answers- still as adults they still come to me when then need to <br/>\n&gt; know something- I think info is so important but also is explaining <br/>\n&gt; how things exist in our society is important too.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>good points.  thanks for your thoughtful replies.  This is really<br/>\nhelping me work this all out.  I know its a tough subject, and many<br/>\npeople have different ideas on this, and probably why I haven&#39;t seen<br/>\nmany responses.  hopefully the dialogue can keep going.

It&#39;s happening all<br/>\nover our country.  Boys are looked at like predators in training.  If<br/>\nthat happens, then Child Protective Services will get involved because<br/>\nyour child is hyper-sexualized and it must be because he&#39;s being<br/>\nabused by his parents or neglected and watching porn on the computer.<br/>\nSeriously.  This is not an exaggeration.  It happened to a friend of<br/>\nmine in Tuscon with her 8 yr old.  The girl initiated it but he got in<br/>\ntrouble because in any conflict of this nature the one with the penis<br/>\nis the aggressor.  Never underestimate the stupidity of the<br/>\ngovernment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how to answer the rest of your questions but the poster<br/>\nthat said criminal is right.

As soon as they started to discover there bodies I think<br/>\nwas her idea.  When she asked what I would do if I had a girl (I&#39;m<br/>\npregnant) and I told her the younger ones could share a bedroom she<br/>\nFREAKED.   The younger one is a boy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here&#39;s my dilemma.  My son happens to get along with girls quite<br/>\nwell.  He recently met a new friend at play practice.  She is his<br/>\nequal in energy, silliness, and volume!  I would love to see them<br/>\nplay!  She is a public school student and I haven&#39;t yet met her<br/>\nparents.  (she&#39;s 10 and my son is 9)<br/>\n<br/>\nA few times that he has played with girls, we have witnessed them<br/>\nbeing curious.  Showing butts and lifting shirts and that sort of<br/>\ninnocent play.  The first time was so innocent and I feel that I never<br/>\nshould have said ANYTHING to her parents.  They were mad and wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nlet her play for a long time.  By the time they would, the they had<br/>\ngrown apart from not seeing each other.  The second time was with<br/>\ngirls I may not have wanted him to play with.  Or at at least<br/>\nunsupervised.  But it did happen.  We had a nice talk about it.  He is<br/>\nreally open with me which is nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that this stuff comes up from time to time.  But him being my<br/>\noldest its all new to me.  What if it happens again?  Am I supposed to<br/>\ntry and prevent it?  I&#39;m not sure I want to encourage it.  But i don&#39;t<br/>\nwant anyone thinking its wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really have a very skewed version of sexuality and what is normal<br/>\nand healthy for children.  I become very uncomfortable when there are<br/>\nsexual scenes in movies and on TV (in regards to my son).  He does not<br/>\nknow what sex is.  Or sexuality.  Do i introduce it?  Or wait for him<br/>\nto ask?  He asked once, and his father told him it was whether you<br/>\nwere a male or female.  He seemed satisfied, but I&#39;m not sure its what<br/>\nhe was looking for.  Should sexuality be a regular topic?  and how do<br/>\nI do this without shocking him right from the get go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling comes pretty easily to me.  But unschooling sex and<br/>\nsexuality???  This is a hard one for me!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29988,"nextTopicId":29951}}
