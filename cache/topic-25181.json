We (3, 6, 8 and <br/>\nparents) had a blast and it is ranked one of our top games and that says <br/>\na lot because we love games and have quite a few.  You collect food, <br/>\nanimal and shelter cards to trade in for habitats and you need four <br/>\nhabitats to win.  You name your zoo when you&#39;re done.  My kids love Zoo <br/>\nTycoon on the computer so this was a love at first play!  We even tend <br/>\nto buy a majority of cooperative games but this one is fun for everyone <br/>\neven if you don&#39;t win.  We still let the kids who didn&#39;t win create the <br/>\nrest of their zoos afterward. <br/>\n<br/>\nA winner in our house and cost $14.96 at Wal Mart.<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25169,"nextTopicId":25065}}
