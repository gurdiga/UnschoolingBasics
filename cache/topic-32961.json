As you related it a few","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2119011874\">Hi Tina<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I understand it, the situation with the crayons that you related in the <br/>\ncontext of sibling rivalry is very aptly chosen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you related it a few points stood out for me<br/>\n<br/>\nsibling rivalry...<br/>\n*** It is so easy to give this diagnosis. :) The remedy is of course <br/>\nunconditional love, starting with ourselves.  I my not so humble opinion SR <br/>\nis the result of someone perceiving themselves to be less accepted.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe 7yr old is constantly<br/>\nirritated by just about EVERYTHING the 2 yr old does.<br/>\n*** My youngest son is constantly irritated at just about EVERYTHING his <br/>\nlittle nieces do. He was &#39;against&#39; them from day one. But then his elder <br/>\nsister, the mother of the little ones, was against him and that is only now <br/>\nslowly changing. - I guess I&#39;ll take this whole thing into my next EFT <br/>\nsession. :) (EFT = Emotional Freedom Techniques - to be used for everything <br/>\n&lt;grin&gt; ) Because what I see here is an irrational emotional thing that is <br/>\nsomehow stuck and gets triggered by the mere persence of the other person. <br/>\nIn our case I would &#39;tap&#39; into the pain of &quot;Mommy does not love me anymore&quot; <br/>\nand I would through in a couple of rounds on my own feelings of guilt at not <br/>\nbeing a good enough mother to both at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nshe is SO like<br/>\ni was as a child...and frankly, to this day i am a highly irritable<br/>\nperson...which is why i get so irritated by what SHE does!<br/>\n*** Irritation, frustration, anger and all these other feelings happen when <br/>\nthe seeming reality does not match our expectations of it. Making peace with <br/>\nwhat is is one of the most difficult things to do without awareness.<br/>\nIf you still have the pain of rejection within it is very reasonable that <br/>\nyou can&#39;t tolerate the thought that your daughter should have to experience <br/>\nthe same pain. And not knowing how to soothe your own pain of course means <br/>\nthat you don&#39;t know how to soothe her pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nso i&#39;m<br/>\ntrying to work on that for myself...hard to help her when i cannot<br/>\nfigure out how to better handle irritation myself! patience is NOT<br/>\none of my strongpoints.<br/>\n*** Please, do yourself a favour and learn EFT (go to emofree.com and <br/>\ndownload the free manual - it is really easy!) and release these pains!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthe 2 yr old is an instigator...he LOVES the reactions he gets from<br/>\njust about everything he does.<br/>\nif he gets a reaction, he&#39;ll keep<br/>\ndoing it. gets really ugly around here on a daily basis.<br/>\n*** My mother once diffused a situation where a younger of my children was <br/>\ninstigating frustration with some elder sibling by fully acknowledging the <br/>\nfeeling of power it gave the younger one. I think she told me that she said <br/>\nto the little one something like, &quot;Ah. It feels good to be so bad, doesn&#39;t <br/>\nit?&quot; and the little one felt totally accepted and let the case rest there.<br/>\n<br/>\ni know i need to be patient and kind...but darned if i&#39;ve been able<br/>\nto do that since nothing i say or do seems to help.<br/>\n*** I find that the only thing that ever seems to help is changing how we <br/>\nthink about something.<br/>\n<br/>\nan example of something that happened yesterday<br/>\nwell all heck broke loose<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nbut i was fuming the whole time. :(<br/>\n*** Three unhappy people. How sad. At least this is in the past and next <br/>\ntime you can handle it all differently. And maybe soon you can feel less <br/>\nguilty about it. &lt;hugs&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ni know i should have stayed calm and talked us all through it but<br/>\ncalm is not really something i&#39;ve been capable of lately (working on<br/>\nthat)...and i did understand that the crayons were special to my<br/>\ndaughter and wanted to respect that...but then i was so ANGRY that<br/>\nshe couldn&#39;t share! at 7!! seems old enough to at least have a small<br/>\ngrasp on sharing.<br/>\n*** She can only share if she feels absolutely safe in doing so. And that is <br/>\nnot something that is based on age. How can you give her this absolute inner <br/>\nknowing that she and her things are as special to you as to her?<br/>\nYou know, I am 55 and I don&#39;t share everything I have, especially things I <br/>\nvalue and where I am not sure that the person that wants part of this is <br/>\nable to value it as much as I do. In my view she has a perfect right to go <br/>\nballistic when she sees her valuables endagered by the &#39;destroyer&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n.but i worry because she&#39;s just gotten so nasty about it<br/>\n*** I guess she is in pain and her only way to handle this is to &#39;bite&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nthat i worry about my son and growing up with a big sister that is so<br/>\nmean ...<br/>\nand how this<br/>\nwill affect HIM!<br/>\n*** yes this is a worrysome thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nsuch a tough thing to balance the needs of 2<br/>\ndifferent children! can&#39;t put the needs of one above the other...how<br/>\nto handle things so all our needs are met?
