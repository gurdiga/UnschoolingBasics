When<br/>\nEowyn casts off the traditional role of &quot;the woman who stays at home<br/>\nwhile the men go off to fight&quot; and then rips her helmet off and<br/>\ndeclares &quot;I am no man!&quot;  I was not the only person in the theater who<br/>\nstood up and cheered!<br/>\n<br/>\nActually I like to look at movies in not so much terms of how they<br/>\nempower women but how women and men treat each other.  That&#39;s much<br/>\nmore important to me than big strong women characters.  I want to see<br/>\nfilms where I see women *and* men respecting each other.  I get a sick<br/>\nfeeling in my stomach from films where women trample men as much as I<br/>\ndo from films where men trample on women.  Maybe it comes from having<br/>\na son and wanting all my children to have healthy relationships and<br/>\nrespect in those relationships.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":241747552,"authorName":"fullmoonfarm_mn","from":"&quot;fullmoonfarm_mn&quot; &lt;fullmoonfarm_mn@...&gt;","profile":"fullmoonfarm_mn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Grrl-power movies","postDate":"1152874429","msgId":15749,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5N3QzdCszNzl2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15750,"prevInTime":15748,"nextInTime":15750,"topicId":15749,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi,all-- we re looking for what you think are some awesome girl- empowering movies, esp for girls entering puberty.
