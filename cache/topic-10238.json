When they are this<br/>\n<br/>\nyoung what do you do or say to them?  Do you allow them to eat<br/>\n<br/>\nwhatever all day?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am exploring and reading alot about unschooling so I am new to it<br/>\n<br/>\nall and this is one thing I am having trouble with.  Any comments are<br/>\n<br/>\nwelcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a daughter in PS that I want to pull out for next year.  She is<br/>\n<br/>\n12.  She has never been homeschooled/unschooled etc so it is a big<br/>\n<br/>\ndecision for me.  I KNOW I will get alot of resistance as far as<br/>\n<br/>\nfamily.  My sister is graduating with a Masters in Education so she<br/>\n<br/>\ncan be a teacher, blah blah so you can understand her resistance. My<br/>\n<br/>\nparents are very mainstream and not adaptable.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother huge concern I have is that my daughters father and I are<br/>\n<br/>\nseperated for 7 years now but still don&#39;t agree on a thing. I have not<br/>\n<br/>\ntold him my intentions to pull her out of school yet but I know I will<br/>\n<br/>\nget resistance from him also.  We have a family court order granting<br/>\n<br/>\nme physical custody (she lives with me, visits him) but with joint<br/>\n<br/>\ncustody and decision making - which means educational decisions also.<br/>\n<br/>\n What should I do???  Should I try to explain to him the<br/>\n<br/>\nun/de-schooling or do I just tell him I will be homeschooling and come<br/>\n<br/>\nup with stuff just to pacify him.  I am so confused and scared.  His<br/>\n<br/>\nwife is a school teacher.  Although I did find out by my daughter that<br/>\n<br/>\nher brother homeschools his 3 kids so there is a slight chance that<br/>\n<br/>\nthey may understand.  The way the systems and gov. are today I am<br/>\n<br/>\nafraid to just pull her out of school, have him take me to court, and<br/>\n<br/>\nlose custody over my daughter due to mainstream thinking that a child<br/>\n<br/>\nshould be in school, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for rambling but my mind is on overload and it&#39;s starting to<br/>\n<br/>\nhinder my deschooling decision and I don&#39;t want that to happen either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice, comments are welcomed.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\n<br/>\nDanielle mom of 3, dd 12, ds 2, dd 1<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Do you allow them to eat<br/>\nwhatever all  day?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*********<br/>\n <br/>\nHi Danielle!  Our experience with food is a bit different than  most, so I <br/>\nthought I would share what we do.  I was a non-controlling food  person from the <br/>\nbeginning, my brother and step-dad fought about food all the  time and I was <br/>\nnever going to make it an issue in my home.   But,  although it has taken a <br/>\nlong time to really understand all the details, both of  my children are food <br/>\nsensitive/reactive and have trouble self-regulating.   I have tried to figure <br/>\nout how to achieve my first goal of non-control and  keeping them healthy and <br/>\nlimit their problem foods.<br/>\n <br/>\nI keep a good supply of their favorite and &quot;safe&quot; foods with easy  access.  <br/>\nThey are free to eat as much as they like of these, whenever they  like.  Foods <br/>\nthat they have trouble regulating, like cookies, I might put a  typical <br/>\nserving size in a ziplock bag and only have a bag or two with their  names with <br/>\neasy access.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen we go to the store, I ask them to pick a set number of treats.   So, <br/>\nkool-aid, sugary cereal, candy and cookies all fall under the same  category.  We <br/>\ntalk a lot about healthy choices and that it is a good idea  to make some <br/>\nhealthy choices every day.  I talk a lot about my own  choices.  I might say out <br/>\nloud &quot;I&#39;m feeling XXXX, I think I&#39;ll eat some  XXXX to feel better&quot; or &quot;I <br/>\nthink I ate too much XXXX because I&#39;m feeling  XXXX.&quot;  After they have had a food <br/>\nrelated bad experience, I might say &quot;I  notice you were feeling XXXX, maybe it <br/>\nwas that XXXX you ate.&quot;  Depending  on the circumstances, I do different <br/>\nthings with a  problem food.   Examples: find a good substitute (different brand <br/>\nsometimes is all it takes),  use homeopathy and other alternative aids, have on <br/>\nhand a special favorite to  offer instead.  I always try to make it about <br/>\nsolving the food mystery, not  blame the child.<br/>\n <br/>\nMost recently, I have started using food enzymes created for autism  <br/>\nspectrum.  One of the products is specifically for a gluten/casien  free diet.  I have <br/>\nseen really positive results in both of my children and  myself, even though <br/>\nwe have never really considered a GFCF diet!

They&#39;re pretty dependent on <br/>\nwhatever you make available. So make a tray with some cut up cheese, <br/>\nfruit, crackers, etc. What not to do is buy a huge pack of M&Ms and <br/>\nlimit him to 4 per day (or whatever). If you&#39;ve got M&Ms, put some <br/>\nout in a small snack cup (rinse out the plastic fruit cup cups, <br/>\nmakes great snack size portion cups) ALONG WITH the cheese and fruit <br/>\nand etc. Yes, they&#39;ll probably disappear first...but then the cheese <br/>\nand fruit will also eventually (unless you put out something he just <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like). Food is food...it&#39;s balance that matters. Balance and <br/>\nattitude. If some food is &#39;bad&#39; then there&#39;s a whole psychology <br/>\nof &quot;I&#39;m not supposed to. But I like it. I feel guilty&quot; Food should <br/>\nnever be tied to guilt. Food should be food. And, kids are naturally <br/>\nbalanced UNTIL we start placing value judgements on things and <br/>\nlimiting this and that. I rad an article a few years ago in <br/>\nParenting magazing by a mom who is also a pediatrician. She was <br/>\nconcerned about her kids&#39; eating patterns (one kid appeared to be <br/>\nliving on macaroni, morning noon and night). So, she tracked <br/>\neverything going into their mouths - including water, juice, etc - <br/>\neverything, for one month (note kids typically balance over a longer <br/>\nperiod than 3 square meals per day). At the end of the time she <br/>\nchecked and they pretty well balanced out on all counts - vitamins, <br/>\nprotein, carbs, etc. Another study with kids around 4 - 10 (or <br/>\nsomething I forget the exact age parameters) checked height, weight, <br/>\netc of the kids and let them at a buffet every day 3 meals per day. <br/>\nBuffet was everything from sliced oranges to cake, fruit, veggies, <br/>\nmeats, cheeses, candy, ice cream, etc. They could take and eat as <br/>\nmuch of whatever as they chose. They were monitored with videotape <br/>\ncameras and regular medical check-ins. And yes, for about a day or <br/>\nthree they went heavy on cake and ice cream. Then one kid in <br/>\nparticular started loading his plate with nothing but oranges, piles <br/>\nof sliced oranges, and downing them like there was no tomorrow. In <br/>\nevaluation (they checked with parents about life stuff going on), <br/>\nthey found out that he had been exposed to a cold and his body was <br/>\ntelling him to fight it. What made this study more interesting to me <br/>\nwas that I have *seen* this behavior in my son. He was maybe 2 1/2 <br/>\nand went through days of eating oranges and more oranges (my fingers <br/>\nwere dyed orange from peeling them!). Then he got a runny nose, then <br/>\nit was gone in all of maybe 2 days while those around were coming <br/>\ndown with a cold that took a week or more to dissipate. Ensure the <br/>\nhealth of our kids is tied up with not destroying the balance they <br/>\nwere designed with by imposing our own constructions on them. Sweet <br/>\nis a built-in - that&#39;s how to tell if something is &#39;safe&#39; in the <br/>\nwild generally speaking. Sweet is carrots and sweet potatoes and <br/>\nsquash (I had an orange skinned boy for a short time when he was a <br/>\ntot lol). Sweet is bell pepper and fruits of all kinds. we&#39;ve got a <br/>\nbowl full of assorted Hershey&#39;s Kisses on our kitchen table. My 7 <br/>\n1/2 yr old, well able to reach whatever he chooses, has barely <br/>\ntouched them. He has however been asking for egg and cheese omelette <br/>\nsandwiches regularly. Something we did when he was about 4 or 5 was <br/>\nnote that he did seem to have very little frustration tolerance if <br/>\nhe hadn&#39;t eaten some protein/carbs together for a while. So, when I <br/>\nsaw the *early* signs of a problem, I&#39;d proactively ask him or, just <br/>\nbring him, a favorite thing like string cheese or PBJ or whatever. <br/>\nAnd, we&#39;d talk about it &quot;I see you are starting to get really <br/>\nfrustrated more than usual. Protein foods seem to have helped you <br/>\nwith that in the past. Would you like strawberry or grape on a PBJ?&quot; <br/>\nover time (and we were rarely that wordy, but all I&#39;ve got here <br/>\nonline is words), he started himself connecting the rising <br/>\nfrustration feeling with the need to get specific kinds of food. So, <br/>\nhe requested we list &#39;protein&#39; foods on the chalkboard so he <br/>\ncould &#39;do it himself&#39; and pick what he wanted. By request we also <br/>\nhave a list of potassium rich foods (relatd to discussion of blood <br/>\npressure and sodium/potassium balance). He&#39;s gotten quite adept now <br/>\n(he&#39;s 7 1/2) in coming up with combinations that have protein, <br/>\npotassium, etc assorted blockbuster combos with lots of nutrition in <br/>\na tasty handy package<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb<br/>\n(can&#39;t comment on pulling a child or the family issues since DS has <br/>\nnever been schooled, and both families are great)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":225503278,"authorName":"charlesdanielle","from":"&quot;charlesdanielle&quot; &lt;charlesdanielle@...&gt;","profile":"charlesdanielle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"some questions","postDate":"1141017495","msgId":10238,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR0dTIybitzZmU2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10241,"prevInTime":10237,"nextInTime":10239,"topicId":10238,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I have been reading many of the posts regarding food intake, sugar, etc.  What about a 2 year old who really doesn t know the difference between what s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-11587957\">Hi, I have been reading many of the posts regarding food intake,<br/>\nsugar, etc.  What about a 2 year old who really doesn&#39;t know the<br/>\ndifference between what&#39;s going to give him a stomach/head ache etc? <br/>\nMy son would eat junk all day.

Any comments are<br/>\nwelcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, <br/>\nI have a daughter in PS that I want to pull out for next year.  She is<br/>\n12.  She has never been homeschooled/unschooled etc so it is a big<br/>\ndecision for me.  I KNOW I will get alot of resistance as far as<br/>\nfamily.  My sister is graduating with a Masters in Education so she<br/>\ncan be a teacher, blah blah so you can understand her resistance. My<br/>\nparents are very mainstream and not adaptable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother huge concern I have is that my daughters father and I are<br/>\nseperated for 7 years now but still don&#39;t agree on a thing. I have not<br/>\ntold him my intentions to pull her out of school yet but I know I will<br/>\nget resistance from him also.  We have a family court order granting<br/>\nme physical custody (she lives with me, visits him) but with joint<br/>\ncustody and decision making - which means educational decisions also.<br/>\n What should I do???  Should I try to explain to him the<br/>\nun/de-schooling or do I just tell him I will be homeschooling and come<br/>\nup with stuff just to pacify him.  I am so confused and scared.  His<br/>\nwife is a school teacher.  Although I did find out by my daughter that<br/>\nher brother homeschools his 3 kids so there is a slight chance that<br/>\nthey may understand.  The way the systems and gov. are today I am<br/>\nafraid to just pull her out of school, have him take me to court, and<br/>\nlose custody over my daughter due to mainstream thinking that a child<br/>\nshould be in school, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for rambling but my mind is on overload and it&#39;s starting to<br/>\nhinder my deschooling decision and I don&#39;t want that to happen either.<br/>\nAny advice, comments are welcomed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nDanielle mom of 3, dd 12, ds 2, dd 1</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10294,"nextTopicId":10171}}
