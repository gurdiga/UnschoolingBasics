But we have 567 famlies that are *members* of the elist. <br/>\nSo that is how many have attended in the past or want to attend in the <br/>\nfuture. And that&#39;s just *this* conference. I&#39;m sure that LIFEisGood <br/>\nUnschooling Conference, NEUnschooling Conference, Living Joyfully <br/>\nUnschooling Conference, as well as Aero and Rethinking Education all <br/>\nhave folks that are not on my list.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHat&#39;s the best start I can think of. You won&#39;t find a more accurate <br/>\n*start*. But there are plenty of folks who have no use for conferences <br/>\nor who can&#39;t afford them or who are just too far away to bother joining <br/>\nthe list---plus so many that don&#39;t even know they exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolingBasics has over 1600 members. AlwaysLearning, over 1400. <br/>\nAlwaysUnschooled has over 1800, SHINEwithUnschooling has over 700, and <br/>\nRUL, over 950. I don&#39;t know how many UnschoolingDiscussion has on <br/>\nGooglegroups, but before the move it was over 1600. YOU have 166 at <br/>\nUnerzogen! I&#39;m sure there are groups in Australia and Great Britain <br/>\nthat I don&#39;t even know about. I DO know that there is an annual <br/>\nunschooling gathering in England--I can&#39;t remember the name <br/>\nthough---anyone? anyone?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is Not Back To School Camp and Quo Vadis--more numbers there.<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted: many of us are on more than one list. But many people choose <br/>\nonly one or two lists to join. Some never join *any* list---they just <br/>\ndo what they do. Many fly under the radar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *will* guesstimate thousands of families unschool in the <br/>\nindustrialized countries. (Many, many more, if not almost everyone in <br/>\nunder-developed and developing countries---so that&#39;s a LOT! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want numbers of *children*, then you can multiply the above <br/>\nnumbers a bit &#39;cause usually it&#39;s just one parent who reads.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry there&#39;s no database of unschoolers---that&#39;s just not going to <br/>\nhappen! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Johanna &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dialog@...\">dialog@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDear List,<br/>\n<br/>\nfor an important Article I&#39;m writing I need a number of how many<br/>\nunschoolers there are in the world and/or just in the US or anywhere<br/>\nspecific.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it can&#39;t be stated exactly, but does anyone know from where I<br/>\ncan retrieve that information?
