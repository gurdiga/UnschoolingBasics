Does their job interfere? Do they believe and trust like you do in natural child development?<br/>\n <br/>\n*****<br/>\n <br/>\nDh, Gary, is very supportive of unschooling.  He has been since the beginning of our homeschooling journey.  In his case, it&#39;s more that he has complete trust in me first, then he comes around later to whatever it is I choose to do with the kids.  In large part, that&#39;s because our oldest child is actually my son, and since I was a parent 10 yrs longer than Gary, he figures I know more what in that arena than he does.  Add to that, I&#39;m an oldest child (he&#39;s an only) so he feels much less experienced at it all.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt has made my life easier to have his confidence and support. The only downside is that it leaves me feeling I must be right and not over-extend my position -- wouldn&#39;t want to fail miserably and have him not trust my future explorations.  Also, to his parents (and other outsiders) it can look like he just lets me do whatever I want, and is uninvolved.  Not only does it make me the heavy, it sells him short.  He&#39;s a great Dad, and really very involved with the boys.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

He acts in a very<br/>\nunschooling sort of way, doesn&#39;t take too much responsibility for other<br/>\npeople&#39;s things etc, likes to hear the outcomes.. Yes there is a big huge<br/>\nBUT hanging there. he seems to flip to the entire other side of it and<br/>\nbecome almost tyrannical in his actions with dd sometimes. He is old (51:-))<br/>\nso perhaps he is conflicted in that he buys some of the older theories of<br/>\nparenting as well in how kids should behave or act for sure. He believes in<br/>\nspanking but I have only seen him use that when he is frustrated and just<br/>\nwants her to do what he wants RIGHT NOW!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if I happen to feel tired or frustrated and complain after a hard day, I<br/>\nget &quot;well then change the way she acts!&quot; like I have something to say about<br/>\nit! LOL. When I reply that I am not the only parent here, he says &quot;she won&#39;t<br/>\nlisten to me&quot; which I think is a cop out that allows him to take a position<br/>\nthat theoretically supports what I am doing but is quick to toss it back as<br/>\nnot something he bought into in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we have some challenges about this and I am wondering how it works for<br/>\nthe rest of you, oh and of course this is not just sent to Valerie (although<br/>\nI value her input) but to everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-LeeHe He<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Valerie [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:valerie@...\">valerie@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 18, 2004 7:25 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] attitudes - response to Karen<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, Karen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re all human, even the 7-year old electrical genius, and we all <br/>\nhave problems. I honestly don&#39;t feel that the achievements of our <br/>\nchildren are what defines whether or not unschooling is &quot;working&quot; in <br/>\nour homes. I feel that the harmony within the home is a more <br/>\naccurate measure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel strongly that &quot;successful&quot; unschooling/parenting depends <br/>\nmostly on the parents attitude. A positive attitude will mean the <br/>\ndifference between success and failure. (I realize that success and <br/>\nfailure are subjective.) A parent saying, &quot;He just plays games all <br/>\nday,&quot; is seeing unschooling as a failure and maybe it&#39;s the parents <br/>\nown personal doubts getting in the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen others would say &quot;he just plays games all day,&quot; I&#39;d say, &quot;she&#39;s <br/>\ngetting SO good at those games. I wish I could keep up with her,&quot; <br/>\nand then I&#39;d ask her to play so I could watch. I LOVED watching her <br/>\nuse strategy and beating the bad guy. I especially had a fondness <br/>\nfor Yoshi. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers saw her as a lazy kid that stayed up all night and slept most <br/>\nof the day. I saw a kid so interested in what she was doing that <br/>\nnight and day were of no consequence to her schedule. She loved the <br/>\nquiet time of the night for getting on the computer and/or reading. <br/>\nI envied her passion for what she was doing and I did eventually <br/>\nlearn to &quot;allow&quot; myself to follow my own passions. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen her father complained that she wasn&#39;t helping out enough around <br/>\nthe house and spending too much time on the computer, I was saying <br/>\nthat her time on the computer was her work; she took it very <br/>\nseriously. Funny now because he doesn&#39;t hesitate to phone her and <br/>\ninterrupt her studies or call her at her job so that she can talk <br/>\nhim through fixing something on his computer. When I visited her <br/>\nlast weekend, I realized the irony when I asked her to stop washing <br/>\nher own dishes and work with me on the computer. She did. After she <br/>\nhelped me, she went back and finished her dishes. (exactly what I <br/>\ndid when she was young)<br/>\n<br/>\nParents can choose to see what their children do with a negative or <br/>\na positive attitude. The difference will be obvious in the harmony <br/>\ninside the home. It&#39;ll also be obvious when the child becomes an <br/>\nadult and her attitudes directly reflect on the parent. I was the <br/>\npositive parent in her childhood and she trusts me 100% with <br/>\neverything she does. Her father was negative and she&#39;s wary of <br/>\nsharing with him, avoiding it when she can. <br/>\n<br/>\nbtw, I&#39;m not bragging; it saddens me. He has never been able to let <br/>\ngo of trying to control her and therefore she spends much of their <br/>\ntime together making sure he doesn&#39;t get too strong a grip on her, <br/>\nwatching what she says so she doesn&#39;t reveal things to him that <br/>\nwould cause his controlling side to gear up. If he&#39;d relax they&#39;d <br/>\nbecome closer. I must say that she handles him really well, but it <br/>\nsaddens me that she has to. <br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Karen Kahn <br/>\n&lt;mamarevkk@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dear Valerie,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks so much for your response on this issue.

That he is not one of the &quot;wunderkids&quot;.  But you would be surprised!! What you feel is just an ordinary everyday thing that your kids do, is something amazing and wonderful to some other parent. My son decided, a few weeks ago, that he wanted a diary.  He had seen one while we were out shopping, and we got a notebook at home and he started writing in it.  His writing penmanship is not spectacular, and his spelling is very crude.  We discussed it and he decided that it would be good for me to rewrite at the bottom of the page what he had written.  It mostly has pictures and a sentence on each page.  I told this story to a member of a local group we are in, and she was amazed.  Told me how advanced my son is.  I did not see this.  It was just part of our ordinary life, but from her point of view it was really cool.  I love our ordinary life.  Doing our ordinary things, and truly enjoying living it with my son<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMichelle <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren Kahn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamarevkk@...\">mamarevkk@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Valerie,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much for your response on this issue.
