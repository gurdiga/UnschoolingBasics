Can you give me an idea of how long you typically leave new","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-666964645\">A member posted this to the owners/moderators of this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to share my response.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you give me an idea of how<br/>\nlong you typically leave new members on moderated status before you <br/>\ntrust them<br/>\nenough to allow them to post freely? I totally get the reason behind <br/>\ninitial<br/>\nmoderation, but it&#39;s hard to keep up with posting when my posts are <br/>\nheld up<br/>\nduring an ongoing conversation and then all sent in a wad.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt varies. For several reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have four moderators. Usually posts come through within seconds of <br/>\nbeing posted---that&#39;s when one or more of us are online at the time and <br/>\nkeep reading and clicking.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there *are* hours (and even an occasional day or two), when we&#39;re <br/>\nALL busy---off with our kids. Sometimes all at the same time <br/>\n(sometimes, even toGETHER! &lt;G&gt;). That&#39;s when messages get sent in <br/>\n&quot;bulk.&quot; It&#39;s because no one&#39;s there to actually do the work. It&#39;s not <br/>\nthat we&#39;re purposefully leaving them in the queue; it&#39;s just that no <br/>\none&#39;s available at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for how long one remains on moderation, that depends on the <br/>\nindividual. Some groups moderate just to make sure the new member isn&#39;t <br/>\na Spammer. We have deeper reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, a member is on for years---posters that lurk and post only <br/>\nvery occasionally may never get off moderation because we never get to <br/>\nknow the poster. They don&#39;t seem to mind. &lt;g&gt; The ones that get off <br/>\nmoderation the fastest are the ones who seem to want to <br/>\nunderstand---who ask questions, reflect on the answers, and ask more <br/>\nquestions. Also---the ones who give advice that is in keeping with the <br/>\nphilosophy of unschooling. Sometimes that can be just a couple of days.<br/>\n<br/>\nModeration stays on if a member repeatedly gives advice that won&#39;t help <br/>\nothers understand unschooling (advice that hinders others on the path). <br/>\nAnd members who seem to want to argue instead of *learn* will stay on <br/>\nmoderation. Members who insist on attacking the list will stay on (or <br/>\nbe put back on) moderation until the attacks stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we let &quot;questionable&quot; posts through because we realize that, <br/>\nalthough they might be contrary to the philosophy, they will be greatly <br/>\nhelpful for discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe use moderation to keep the list moving as smoothly as possible. <br/>\nUnschooling and mindful parenting are not easy concepts to understand. <br/>\nSo we want *all* advice to move the posters TOWARDS unschooling, not <br/>\naway. People teetering on the fence, almost there, need a gentle <br/>\n*shove* forward, NOT a pull back. It&#39;s so much easier to fall back on <br/>\nwhat we&#39;re already familiar with. It&#39;s sooo much harder to take that <br/>\ntiny step forward. Allowing newbies to constantly keep pulling each <br/>\nother back *won&#39;t* help them move forward. Moderation helps prevent <br/>\nsome of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind, that, occasionally too, yahoo glitches and posts take a <br/>\nwhile to arrive (no fault of the list!). I had a post that took four <br/>\nDAYS to post. So it&#39;s not always *us*! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand if you feel you<br/>\nshould keep this going for a while, but I think if that&#39;s the case I <br/>\nwill look<br/>\nfor another group. After reading some of the posts of other members, <br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure my input is going to be very popular, anyway, and that&#39;s<br/>\nokay. Diff&#39;rent strokes, and all that.  ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nI see you have now unsubbed. But you left before reading any responses <br/>\nto your &quot;teaching&quot; question. I&#39;m forwarding Joyce&#39;s answer on to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not unusual for folks to unsub and then come back later eager to <br/>\nlearn more because *something* rang true.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you believe your &quot;input&quot; won&#39;t be popular, don&#39;t post---or be ready <br/>\nto defend why if you do. (That&#39;s true of all lists, really. And in <br/>\nlife!)<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent strokes, yes. And although there used to be only one list <br/>\navailable, there are now dozens and dozens of unschooling lists to <br/>\nchoose from. One will fit right.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMore new features than ever.
