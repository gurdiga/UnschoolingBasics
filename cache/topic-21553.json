Granted, DAN<br/>\nstands for &quot;Defeat Autism Now&quot;... but our DAN doctor<br/>\n(Ann Arbor, Michigan) is very much into homeopathy. We<br/>\nfound out my son had a yeast overgrowth, and the<br/>\nresults came back with two different ways to treat it.<br/>\nOne was a prescription and one was herbal. He<br/>\nrecommended the herbal over prescription. Same thing<br/>\nwhen my son had scabies. We could have treated it with<br/>\nthe prescription cream (which he said would be okay),<br/>\nbut that if we wished to go the other route.. then we<br/>\nshould give these supplements and cover the affected<br/>\nareas with neem oil every day. It took as long to get<br/>\nrid of as it would have taken with the prescription,<br/>\nand was a lot healthier, IMHO. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTV dinner still cooling? <br/>\nCheck out &quot;Tonight&#39;s Picks&quot; on Yahoo!
