You originally posted that you have a 22 yo ds and a 16 yo dd  that were/are unschooled.  Tell us about a typical day with either of them.  Tell us about *your* unschooling life now.  Maybe someone can learn something important from you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe owners, moderators and long-time list members have a wealth of wisdom to give.  They are happy to give it for free, to help others understand unschooling so they can live free, joyous and respectful lives with their children.   You&#39;ve taken up a lot of the list&#39;s time refuting people&#39;s loving lives with their kids.

Nothing here is actual &quot;proof&quot;, again it is all speculation, and <br/>\n&gt; what others conclude. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am not trying to paint anything, I am simply commenting back on what was said <br/>\n&gt; to me. I am responding to facts that are being said, not painting any pictures. <br/>\n&gt; What has been said is pretty clear and what I am supposedly &quot;painting&quot; is from <br/>\n&gt; what I am reading here. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Keeping up with all this is not something I really care to do. If reading into <br/>\n&gt; everything and analyzing everyone and everything that is said is what people <br/>\n&gt; enjoy, then that if fine. As for me I do have a life away from the computer and <br/>\n&gt; I am getting on with it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enjoy your debates and judging everyone that doesn&#39;t agree with your philosophy, <br/>\n&gt; I am done with all of this. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~~After talking with the parents there and hearing their <br/>\n&gt; philosophy on not telling their kids what to do, no matter what the <br/>\n&gt; consequences. And not teaching them anything, let them learn it all on <br/>\n&gt; their own, I quickly changed my mind about being an unschooler~~ <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This statement here proves that you have spent very little time around <br/>\n&gt; any unschoolers or talking with them in any depth. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, we trust our children can make their own decisions. But that <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean &quot;let them do whatever they want&quot; nor does it equal a <br/>\n&gt; free-for-all that you are trying to paint. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a LOT harder to build trusting relationships (yet easier in the <br/>\n&gt; long run) than to forbid and punish (which has already been proven to <br/>\n&gt; NOT work). If you were open enough to ask HOW that can work and WHY <br/>\n&gt; punishment and forbidding are less effective methods, we can give <br/>\n&gt; specifics. The defensive nature and antagonistic way you are phrasing <br/>\n&gt; things isn&#39;t going to lead to a back and forth in which we can all <br/>\n&gt; discuss various options. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If punishment and coercion don&#39;t work (and it&#39;s pretty obvious it <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t) then what are the options for parents? I believe that we can <br/>\n&gt; live in a way that honors each persons needs and desires. I KNOW we <br/>\n&gt; can live this way because we DO. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have four children that trust their needs/wants and desires are just <br/>\n&gt; as important as mine. It makes the flow of family life a lot better. <br/>\n&gt; But it&#39;d hard to describe this trusting flow to an outsider that has <br/>\n&gt; already decided we&#39;re a bunch of nuts. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Funny thing though, everyone is always commenting on how interesting <br/>\n&gt; and nice my kids are. Without forbidding, without punishing or laying <br/>\n&gt; down any &quot;law&quot; I have four very different children that WANT to be <br/>\n&gt; healthy and happy (even though they choose very differently from me at <br/>\n&gt; times). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ren <br/>\n&gt; learninginfreedom. com <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; ____ <br/>\n&gt; Sick sense of humor?

Its also worthwhile to consider how people <br/>\nlearn things, so you can help your kids learn to be respectful. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf by respect you mean &quot;compliance&quot; then a certain amount of that is <br/>\na result of personality. Some people like to smooth things over and <br/>\ncreate a peaceful environment by nature, and will be compliant and <br/>\ngive up things they want in order to do that.

I have a problem with any kind of label being associated with me or my family. <br/>\n <br/>\nWay back when I decided to teach my son at home, I went to an unschoolers meeting in Boston. After talking with the parents there and hearing their philosophy on not telling their kids what to do, no matter what the consequences. And not teaching them anything, let them learn it all on their own, I quickly changed my mind about being an unschooler. After much trial and error over the years, I realized that the best way for my kids to learn was to let them just do whatever it was that they were interested in. We got the basic math and english out of the way and they did, and still do what they are passionate about. <br/>\n <br/>\nThough my method for school with my daughter is &quot;unschooling,&quot; I will no longer use that term to describe our situation. I see from this group that &quot;unschooling&quot; seems to also mean &quot;unparenting.&quot; I love my kids too much to just let them make decisions that will end up harming them. Yes, I believe in letting kids make mistakes to help them to learn and mature, but never to bring mental or physical harm to themselves. I don&#39;t care if you want to call it controlling, manipulating, whatever. I call it being a loving parent concerned for my child&#39;s welfare.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am done with this group and the narrow minded way everyone seems to be when it comes to parenting a child. I also don&#39;t like the way so many have judged a family that no one on here even knew. I could understand if you actually saw the behavior you describe in person, but none of you did. You are all going by what you have read or saw on the news. And then making your own assumptions on how she was brought up.  I saw the real family, saw the love they had for their kids. What happened to them was a shock to all who knew them. What happened to them could have been avoided had their daughter respected them, and respected their wishes.<br/>\nAll you talk about is respecting your children, what about their respecting their parent. Does that suddenly not matter? <br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy judging all those that don&#39;t believe in what you do, or fit into your perfect unschooling mold! <br/>\n<br/>\nFunny, I always thought that unschoolers would be the last ones to judge anyone else...wrong again!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nPark yourself in front of a world of choices in alternative vehicles.
