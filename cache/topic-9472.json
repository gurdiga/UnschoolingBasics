So far I&#39;ve opend two pixie<br/>\nstiks and one dulce de leche(hard candy, really tasty) that I actually<br/>\ntried to talk Reid into giving me.  I offered him doughnuts for<br/>\nbreakfast, the same doughnuts that he asked for at the store, and he<br/>\nwanted candy and boops (Fruit Loops.)<br/>\nWhen our oldest was much younger, we never really considered our<br/>\nlimits as limits.  My wife and I are both cooks and have always<br/>\noffered a variety of food.  We&#39;ve doled out &quot;treats&quot; when we thought<br/>\nappropriate.  We never had any issues with him and eating.  He&#39;s<br/>\nalways liked a variety of food and been willing to try new stuff.<br/>\nI&#39;d read about non-limiting on unschooling boards, mostly Joyce&#39;s and<br/>\nSandra Dodd&#39;s sites.  We never really considered it though thinking<br/>\nthat our limits on candy/sweets and tv were obviously right, and we<br/>\nwere at least well intentioned, as are most parents.<br/>\nWith some other personal changes I&#39;ve been working on, I&#39;ve been<br/>\nsaying yes to the tv and video games.  Then came &quot;I want some candy&quot;<br/>\nfrom my youngest followed by that sweetest of little smiles.  My wife<br/>\nhas been a little unwilling to jump in as I have, though I&#39;ve pointed<br/>\nher to the sites I&#39;ve been reading.  She works a lot and doesn&#39;t<br/>\nalways have the time on the computer she would like.  Neither of us<br/>\nwant a candy addict child, which seems the obvious outcome to allowing<br/>\ncandy when the child wants.<br/>\nSo, yesterday and now today, on the table sits as much candy as either<br/>\nof them could want.  My older son has picked through and eaten some<br/>\ncandy.  My younger has almost binged on candy.  I actually threw away<br/>\nas much candy as he ate yesterday.  He would open or ask for help<br/>\nopening something, try it, then put it down.  Three different<br/>\nlollipops, one piece of gum, a small Hershey bar, random pieces of<br/>\nrandom hard candy.  And this doesn&#39;t even include the amount of pixie<br/>\nstik I&#39;ve wiped off the table that never made it to his mouth.  If<br/>\nnothing else, maybe I&#39;ll get some insight into his candy preferences.<br/>\nAnd my oldest?  He&#39;s at some ungodly high level on Pokemon on his<br/>\nGameboy.  My only problem with the Gameboy is that he&#39;s so busy on it<br/>\nthat he doesn&#39;t want to play any Goldeneye with me on the Gamecube.<br/>\nI do want what&#39;s best for the boys, and I see nothing but common sense<br/>\nwhen I take the time to ponder/ruminate on a lot of the ideals behind<br/>\nunschooling and the parenting ideas inherent to unschooling.<br/>\nSo I&#39;m trying not to see this as an experiment.  I&#39;m not planning on<br/>\ngoing back to how things were.  But a lifetime of thinking(knowing)<br/>\nyou know best, all the voices of parents who have gone before, all<br/>\nthese things that make it difficult.  And I can&#39;t help but think, what<br/>\nif he really does decide to put himself on an all candy diet?  I know<br/>\nthat won&#39;t happen.  He didn&#39;t eat just candy yesterday, and I know he<br/>\nwon&#39;t today, but it&#39;s still hard to . . .not sure what I&#39;m thinking<br/>\nwith this, just EGAD, I guess.<br/>\nOh, I just opened a huge gum ball for him.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9471,"nextTopicId":9430}}
