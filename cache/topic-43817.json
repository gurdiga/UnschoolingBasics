It is not too late. it fact, it is perfect timing. You&#39;re actions will show your son how much you are listening. Last year I pulled my 2nd and 3rd graders out of public with mid-may. We love the freedom so much.  I then pulled my 6th grader out (he was begging to come home) out of a very expensive private school. 3 weeks left of the year. The school was *shocked* because of how it would look on his *record*.<br/>\nI am in CA and I didnt have to file until October of the next year. For the public school I did have to write a letter notifying them we were tranferring to a &#39;private&#39; school. They had IEP&#39;S and it was all fine. Just check your states laws. Know them going in. Our principal grilled me and told me all kinds of things I had to do, paper work I had to provide and tried to intimidate me. I was able to correct him  and walked out confident of my rights.  <br/>\nFor all of my boys, not having them finish the last few weeks of the year was my way of saying I was sorry I put them through that hell to start with.

Here, we report each year to the county superintendent of schools and every year he wanted more information, claimed he *required* more information than I was legally obligated to give.
