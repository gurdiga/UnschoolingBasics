So yeah, you can unschool and still worry of <br/>\ncourse. But part of REALLY GETTING unschooling, deep down in my <br/>\nheart and knowing it as TRUTH, was worries disappearing. Gone, poof! <br/>\nJust like that.<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t happen overnight, I don&#39;t know exactly the moment it <br/>\nhappened, but it did.<br/>\nI think worries about our children are part of being a concerned <br/>\nparent, but I never worry about unschooling harming my child in any <br/>\nway.
