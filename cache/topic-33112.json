As with *everything* since we started this RU path, any issue has been with me and not them.  I had an epiphany the other day when I realized that I&#39;m pushing against it because *I&#39;m* bored.  I was remembering that before I had kids, everything exciting to me was outside my house, because I&#39;m not a crafter, a scrapbooker, a baker, a knitter, etc., I was very active and invoved with lots outside the house.  So now I find myself wandering around (while my girls are *perfectly* happy playing, watching tv, reading, etc.) wondering what on earth to do with myself.  I think I devoured 1000 books from last summer until now, and I seem to not be too interested in reading right now, so I&#39;m back to what is that Jodi loves to do??  I will do some more exploration with that this week.  Someone else mentioned just allowing them to enjoy the gentle, quiet days at home...good advice too :).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n          <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jodi Bezzola &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jodibezzola@...\">jodibezzola@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas?

I  <br/>\nbet they have favorite shows. I bet there are things you could do  <br/>\nrelated to those shows. My youngest daughter loved the Arthur tv shows  <br/>\n- we bought her a little Arthur lunch box and she used to get up in  <br/>\nthe morning and make herself a lunch and put it in her Arthur  <br/>\nlunchbox. Then she&#39;d eat it later in the day. We&#39;d talk about what she  <br/>\nwanted to have for food in her lunch box - so there was a cool period  <br/>\nof time when we were talking a lot about foods and we were shopping  <br/>\nand she&#39;d carefully pick out what she&#39;d decided on - an apple or  <br/>\nbanana or string cheese or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother show my kids all really loved was Reading Rainbow. They&#39;d make  <br/>\nup their own versions of the segments at the end of the show when the  <br/>\nkids come on and say, &quot;If you liked ......that book....., then you&#39;ll  <br/>\nlove .... this one....&quot;. We&#39;d video them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe often got tapes of the music from shows they liked a lot. And, just  <br/>\nTHIS week, my 17 year old bought two Animaniacs cd&#39;s - and we&#39;ve  <br/>\nlistened to them all week. It has been years since we listened to our  <br/>\nold Animaniacs cassette tapes and it brought back such wonderful  <br/>\nmemories!<br/>\n<br/>\nReally - if kids seem to be &quot;doing nothing but watching tv,&quot; then I  <br/>\nsuggest you stick with the principle of supporting their interests!  <br/>\nDon&#39;t toss the tv out the door - instead, revel in it. And expand on  <br/>\nit - use it to make all kinds of other things happen in your  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling could be called &quot;Learning through Connections.&quot; Or maybe,  <br/>\n&quot;One Thing Leads to Another Learning.&quot; It is hard to imagine anything  <br/>\nmuch better than tv as a place to start with finding connections and  <br/>\nletting one thing lead to another<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes parents who think their kids are watching too much tv do the  <br/>\nopposite of supporting their interest. They won&#39;t buy toys or foods or  <br/>\nclothes that are tv-show related, for example. I&#39;m encouraging you to  <br/>\nREVEL in what they love. When they grow up, they&#39;ll continue to revel  <br/>\nin what they love! THAT is the attitude toward life I wanted my kids  <br/>\nto have and they do.

You will be making their world smaller when you should be making it bigger.  You should provide for them with as many of the resource you&#39;re able to so they have a lot of experiences and inspiration and entertainment.   If you had a child who really liked to read you probably wouldn&#39;t take his books away.   If you had a kid who liked to play outside you wouldn&#39;t make the outdoors off limits.   <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of taking the TV away, *add* new things to your life.  Go for more trips, more walks, more hikes, more picnics.   Play more games, make interesting foods, plant a garden, cook outside, go swimming, go boating, go camping.  Wander around a mall, go to a museum, an art gallery, a craft store.   Go ride Bumper Cars, visit an archery range, a climbing wall, a fish hatchery.   Get a trampoline, put in a sandbox, go play tennis, get some new video games, rent funny movies.   Get Tivo and record your kid&#39;s favorite things so that family outings don&#39;t mean they have to give up something else they love.  It&#39;s your job to get creative and make the world a big and interesting place for them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":278078532,"authorName":"Carron Armstrong","from":"&quot;Carron Armstrong&quot; &lt;carronna@...&gt;","profile":"cararmst","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Anybody here ..living without a tv ??","postDate":"1211866616","msgId":33178,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5MWM1ZGUxMDgwNTI2MjIzNnBhMjYzMmYxbzhiNjBlZDY1MTkyODI3ZThAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGcxY2kzZytxZDdrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGcxY2kzZytxZDdrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33172,"nextInTopic":33180,"prevInTime":33176,"nextInTime":33179,"topicId":33112,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve never gone without TV.

The T.V. shows they like could be a jumping off point for some new toys, if they like Diego, maybe some cool new animals, build a  treehouse together, go on &#39;rescue&#39; missions (like hiding different animals around the house and going off to find them).<br/>\nAnother thing if they don&#39;t like to go out but you would like to see what kind of toys  they would like is shopping online with them (or without them, to give you ideas, and order some new cool things online). To get ideas you can look at sites like leapsandbounds.com, magiccabin.com etc. or type in a keyword into ebay and seeing what comes up. Sometimes you can get really cool selections of toys for not so much money.<br/>\nAlso, what I am just learning more of recently, just go do something new yourself that YOU are really excited about. Sometimes, they might tag along, watch you, or not, but if they see that you are still curious and trying out new things, the spirit of it is catching. I have really gotten into gardening lately, then decided to build a pond in the backyard etc, and they have been coming with me to different places like Garden Centers or the NE Wildflower Society and picking out their own plants, helping me grow things, and just doing all kinds of experiments in the backyard.<br/>\nI could go on and on, but I am being called...<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nMara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Jodi Bezzola &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jodibezzola@...\">jodibezzola@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, May 26, 2008 7:35:46 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Anybody here ..living without a tv ??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmarji &lt;marji@gaiawolf. org&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n~~If I felt that TV was taking over his life, then I would not get rid of the TV but do whatever I could to make his environment richer so that TV is not necessarily the most interesting thing in his environment. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so glad this was written.

In those early years, I lived in a tiny apartment<br/>\nwhere my grandma took care of me while my parents worked (mom was still in<br/>\nmedical school or an intern). She and I talked a lot while she cooked and<br/>\ncleaned, and I played pretend with my dolls, wrote on my chalkboard, and<br/>\nread little books we got at the corner news kiosk. Grandma took me to the<br/>\npark every single day, walking down stimulating city streets (full of<br/>\nprinted signs to read, architectural patterns, pedestrian traffic, that sort<br/>\nof thing).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt four I began preschool and when one day I came back asking &quot;what is<br/>\n(insert name of popular kids&#39; TV show) my parents though: &quot;Oh no, she&#39;ll be<br/>\na social outcast&quot;. They figured I was already on that path because I could<br/>\nread and preferred to spend most of my choice time in the &quot;quiet corner&quot;<br/>\nwith books and the occasional puzzle, rather than with the kids (mostly but<br/>\nnot all boys) whom I consider too rowdy in the &quot;block corner&quot; or the<br/>\nsometimes cliquish girls (yes, four years olds can be cliquish!) in the<br/>\n&quot;house&quot; corner. (As a side note, I&#39;m not sure why I never showed any<br/>\ninterest in playing the &quot;mom&quot; or the &quot;sister&quot; or the &quot;baby&quot; - on the other<br/>\nhand later at 10 or so I enjoyed and thrived in the role of Sabrina in many<br/>\nimaginary &quot;Charlie&#39;s Angels&quot; episodes! LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we got a TV. Of course, TV there at that time was not unlimited with all<br/>\nthe channels 24/7 like we have now, so I was naturally limited to a couple<br/>\nof 1-hour-long afternoon live musical/variety-type shows that included maybe<br/>\none or two cartoons (which my mother didn&#39;t like - she disapproved of<br/>\nassociating &quot;inane violence&quot; with humor a la Road Runner, but she still let<br/>\nme watch them, while stating her opinion). By the start of school, I&#39;d lost<br/>\ninterest in the &quot;preschool shows&quot; and was too busy playing with friends<br/>\nafter school, reading, and generally living life...plus there was nothing<br/>\nreally interesting on TV except for maybe Little House on the Prairie and<br/>\nthe Magical World of Disney, on Friday nights and Sundays, which we watched<br/>\nas a family.  This was on black and white until I was about 7, I think. It<br/>\nwas also around that time that Carl Sagan&#39;s Cosmos aired. And at some point<br/>\nI remember my family watching the Roots mini series, too (mostly without<br/>\nme). But my point is TV shows then were definitely an event, not something<br/>\nthat was on all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, that is a *healthy* model of living with TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nFastforward to my late teens, now we have a big (color!) screen and cable<br/>\nAND a satellite dish and all sorts of channels including MTV and morning<br/>\ngame shows and CONSTANT news and late night informercials and a cartoon<br/>\nchannel and, and...Life at home almost invariably happens to the soundtrack<br/>\nof the TV in the family room, the hub of the home. But at least there was<br/>\njust the one TV in the house, and whenever we were all at home we would most<br/>\nof the time all be in that one room, simultaneously doing other things (my<br/>\nmother even set up her sewing table in there, my dad reading the paper or<br/>\noccasionally playing a a card game or board game with me).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, IMO, bonding around the TV can also be healthy for a family.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, most of my adult life, certainly the past several years we&#39;ve lived<br/>\nwithout cable (except for when my mom would come to visit, then she enjoys<br/>\nher home and garden shows while busy baking or sewing or crocheting, and at<br/>\ntimes the kids would watch a lot of Animal Planet and Kids Discovery<br/>\nChannel) but with a steady supply of library videos and more recently<br/>\nNetflix, which like someone else says, has among its advantages that it<br/>\n&quot;starts and ends&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are soon to get FiOs, and a bigger, flat screen, and a dedicated<br/>\n&#39;media/computer&#39; room. I am very ambivalent about this - I can see the joy<br/>\nin recovering our family room from under all the Guitar Hero and World of<br/>\nWarcraft so that it feels &quot;light and calm&quot; enough again to read books and<br/>\nbuild models and play instruments in (rather than having to go into a<br/>\nbedroom for any of those!) I&#39;m *hoping* we will be like those here who have<br/>\nsaid they have control of the TV, not the other way around. I am optimistic<br/>\nthat I won&#39;t &quot;lose&quot; my family in that room (or alternatively end up in there<br/>\n24/7 myself in order to be with them), but only time will tell!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you&#39;ll all forgive me for writing this long statement here, but it&#39;s<br/>\nbeen helpful for me to distill what I really believe makes a healthy family<br/>\nrelationship with TV. This includes it being an &quot;event&quot; or series of events<br/>\n(vs a constant background), and a source of family bonding (vs isolation).<br/>\nOf course things aren&#39;t black and white and I know there will be days<br/>\n(particularly days when someone happens to be down with some virus or we&#39;re<br/>\njust pooped after a camping trip and devote a day just to hanging out in our<br/>\nPJs and doing tons of laundry, etc) when the TV will be on for hours on end,<br/>\nand that is perfectly fine with me, s long as it doesn&#39;t become a way of<br/>\nlife for us. It&#39;s just that I hear of so many people with 3-4-5 TV<br/>\nhouseholds where family members are each isolated in their own little world,<br/>\nand know so many kids talking about having watched shows that are IMO<br/>\ncompletely inappropriate for them in content, with their parents not even<br/>\nrealizing it or not thinking there&#39;s anything wrong with it. To each their<br/>\nown, I just don&#39;t want our life to be like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1-they could not identify with other children who watched tv...making them<br/>\n&gt; sort of social outcasts.<br/>\n&gt; 2-they could read well, and loved to read.. but when we eventually got a<br/>\n&gt; tv, they watched everything, all the time.. they were starved of tv<br/>\n&gt; (although thier love for reading did continue)<br/>\n&gt; 3-they are no smarter than thier peers who did have tv in thier homes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; although it did help us to be closer in the evening, when many people sit<br/>\n&gt; in front of the tv and &quot;veg out&quot;... I think that we would have had a lot of<br/>\n&gt; good memories about movies or tv shows, that we watched together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; also, tv does invite and introduce many subject matters to your children,<br/>\n&gt; and that introduction allows you to speak to them about it. (especially the<br/>\n&gt; lifetime movies), lol<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; that is my take on &quot;doing with out&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ***Julie***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Life isn&#39;t about finding yourself, it&#39;s about creating yourself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----<br/>\n&gt; From: ann329851 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:annworsley991@...\">annworsley991@...</a>&lt;annworsley991%40btinternet.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, May 25, 2008 4:27:28 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Anybody here ..living without a tv ??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; we are just about to &#39;&#39;go without &#39;&#39;. and i know there will be tons of<br/>\n&gt; other stuff to do. but i must admit..i feel like someone has chopped<br/>\n&gt; off one of me limbs !!! anyone else survive without it ?? ann<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Anybody here ..living without a tv ??","postDate":"1211814989","msgId":33153,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcxZWs4ZCt0YWIwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDgwNTI2MDI0NS5tNFEyamxEQTAxMTYyNUBvbXIxMC5uZXR3b3Jrc29sdXRpb25zZW1haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33150,"nextInTopic":33157,"prevInTime":33152,"nextInTime":33154,"topicId":33112,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Three of us are on our laptops, my husband is folding laundry, and  <br/>\nwe&#39;re all watching a show about Indiana Jones on the History Channel -  <br/>\nIndiana Jones and the Ultimate Quest. It is mostly about the history  <br/>\nof people who have searched for legendary artifacts. We&#39;re all talking  <br/>\nabout it - and googling various things that have come up. LOTS of  <br/>\ninteresting connections. There are commercials - we&#39;ve been talking  <br/>\nabout those, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t sit around watching only &quot;educational&quot; tv - this just happens  <br/>\nto be what is on right this minute. Last night we watched hours of  <br/>\n&quot;The Office.&quot; That experience gives us a large base of shared humor -  <br/>\nit comes up in our conversations all the time. Again, lots of  <br/>\nconnections.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven when the kids were really young, the same kind of bonding and  <br/>\nconnections happened with children&#39;s tv shows - sometimes  <br/>\nintentionally educational shows, sometimes shows that anti-tv people  <br/>\nwould point to as &quot;junk.&quot; ANY time we parents watch shows with our  <br/>\nchildren, seeing them through our children&#39;s eyes, wonderful  <br/>\nopportunities for bonding and connection-making exists. Those who  <br/>\ndon&#39;t allow tv are really missing out on something great.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan they live happy unschooling lives without tv? Of course. They  <br/>\ncould live happy unschooling lives without books, too. Or without a  <br/>\nbeach (we live near the ocean). Or without art supplies or bicycles or  <br/>\nlegos or Disneyland.  People may not live near an ocean or be able to  <br/>\nafford a Disneyland pass, but TV is cheap and everywhere. So why give  <br/>\nup something so beneficial?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that parents often subconsciously think of it as a sacrifice  <br/>\nthat will somehow keep their children safe. I understand this. We love  <br/>\nour little ones so MUCH and feel so strongly that they are such a huge  <br/>\nresponsibility, and we are terrified when we realize how much of what  <br/>\nthey will experience in life is out of our control.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling takes courage and doesn&#39;t work well in a fearful  <br/>\nenvironment. Unschooling also helps parents become less and less  <br/>\nfearful, over time. I think that&#39;s why unschoolers began to question  <br/>\nthe conventional wisdom among &quot;good&quot; parents that TV is necessarily  <br/>\nharmful. We got the habit of thinking specifially about our own kids,  <br/>\nnot thinking of them as &quot;generic&quot; children, but as individuals. We had  <br/>\nthe guts to ask ourselves, &quot;Exactly how would watching tv really harm  <br/>\nRoya or Roxana or Rosie?&quot; (Fill in your own kids&#39; names.) We looked at  <br/>\nthe real evidence in front of our own eyes. We also went back and read  <br/>\nthe anti-tv books and articles and realized that they didn&#39;t apply to  <br/>\nkids who were living the way our kids were - our kids had lots of  <br/>\ntime, for example, to read and play AND watch tv. Our kids weren&#39;t  <br/>\nescaping from school-induced stress by vegging out in front of the tv  <br/>\n- they were actively engaged in their tv-watching. It wasn&#39;t the kind  <br/>\nof passive zombie-like experience that the anti-tv &quot;experts&quot;  <br/>\ndescribed. Over time, we stopped being afraid or nervous and started  <br/>\nreveling in the real-life experience of enjoying all the amazing  <br/>\nvariety of experience available through television.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have so MANY good memories centered around tv. My kids are 17, 20  <br/>\nand 23. I have absolutely NO regrets about our tv-watching. I wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nwant to have missed it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On May 25, 2008, at 6:40 PM, julie leonard wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; although it did help us to be closer in the evening, when many  <br/>\n&gt; people sit in front of the tv and &quot;veg out&quot;...

I think that we would have had a lot of good memories about movies or tv shows, that we watched together.<br/>\n<br/>\nalso, tv does invite and introduce many subject matters to your children, and that introduction allows you to speak to them about it.

At that time the cable bill <br/>\nwas not in the budget and there was no antenna, so we went without.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nwatched tv very rarely since then and do not miss it.  We have the lowest <br/>\nnetflix membership and once every few months may rent from a video <br/>\nstore.  My daughters are here 3+ days a week and do not seem to miss it <br/>\nhere at all.  At their mother&#39;s they watch it, one very little, one more often.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that living without the constant barrage from the rabid <br/>\ncommercialism of mass media was liberating, and my daughters are much more <br/>\naware of the psychology of chronic want that is so pervasive in our <br/>\nculture.  I noticed a marked decrease in the kids asking for things when we <br/>\nshopped, or feeling like they just had to have the latest fad item.  They <br/>\nseem to evaluate things based on their own impression of the item and most <br/>\ntimes find all the stuff that pass through our culture from week to week to <br/>\nbe useless and sad.  Without the constant blatant and subliminal message <br/>\nthat this or that is what they need now they look at so much of the junk <br/>\nour culture produces as just that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso found that once we lived without it for a while, trying to watch a <br/>\nshow that is interrupted every few minutes by commercials was not enjoyable <br/>\nat all.  Most tv series or movies that are at all popular make it to DVD <br/>\nfairly quickly and watching them without interruption is so much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what we have found.  It works for us.  If you want to find out if <br/>\nit will work for you I would recommend going without for six months.
