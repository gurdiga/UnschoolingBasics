When my now-13-year-old son, Liam, was<br/>\n&gt; really little he could be pretty aggressive with our old kitty. He<br/>\n&gt; had no malice whatsoever, but the principle of everyone, including<br/>\n&gt; our wonderful cat, being safe in the house was my biggest concern for<br/>\n&gt; me. I felt it was not fair to the cat not to ensure his safety to<br/>\n&gt; the best of my ability.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I did was redirect Liam; rather than saying no, I&#39;d find<br/>\n&gt; something else that was at least as fun if not more fun to do. That<br/>\n&gt; could mean getting out of the house for a few minutes or for a longer<br/>\n&gt; time. Just something to change things up a bit. I also made sure<br/>\n&gt; the cat had a safe place to be. And, I helped Liam find ways to love<br/>\n&gt; the cat that weren&#39;t so scary for the cat. I modeled better, more<br/>\n&gt; gentle ways of interacting with the cat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After that cat passed on and we got a couple of younger cats, the<br/>\n&gt; cats&#39; safety was still a concern. I did talk to Liam about my<br/>\n&gt; concerns (he was probably 6 or 7 years old at the time), not in a<br/>\n&gt; punishing or shaming way. We talked about their safety and his safety<br/>\n&gt; and my safety, and I asked him what he thought we should do about<br/>\n&gt; making sure the cats are safe in their own home. He agreed that<br/>\n&gt; everyone should be safe in the house, and he became much, much more<br/>\n&gt; respectful of the cats&#39; autonomy. Now, he is quite an advocate for the cats.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I should point out that I did consider finding another home for the<br/>\n&gt; cats, even temporarily, as unthinkable to me as that was. I felt<br/>\n&gt; that I needed to provide them with a safe home, and I had to be<br/>\n&gt; honest with myself about whether or not I could do that. I&#39;m glad it<br/>\n&gt; never came to that, but it was on the table.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It was a process, to be sure, and I would never leave him alone with<br/>\n&gt; the cat when he was little. I would never leave him alone ~ period ~<br/>\n&gt; when he was little (I&#39;m not assuming you do that, though; I&#39;m just<br/>\n&gt; telling you what *I* did).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I hope that story helps a little.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Marji<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.joyfullyparenting.com/\">http://www.joyfullyparenting.com/</a>&gt;Joyfully Parenting & Life Coaching<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://zintz-kunkel.blogspot.com/\">http://zintz-kunkel.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;Our Unschooling Life (a &#39;blog)<br/>\n&gt; Live Fully ~ Live JoyFully!<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"&quot;Karen Swanay&quot; &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] cats, and kids","postDate":"1203277367","msgId":29918,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwMjE3MTE0Mng3ZDhhNjMyZHg4MGI0YmYzYzliMTA5ZDBiQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwODcwMWM4NzE5OCQwOWNiODY4MCRhZjQ1MmZjNEB1bHJpa2VhZjEyZmFmYT4=","referencesHeader":"PGZwOXJ0aytkM3FkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDAwODcwMWM4NzE5OCQwOWNiODY4MCRhZjQ1MmZjNEB1bHJpa2VhZjEyZmFmYT4="},"prevInTopic":29916,"nextInTopic":29921,"prevInTime":29917,"nextInTime":29919,"topicId":29853,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"OK Karen I deleted my next words because I felt that you would take umbrage again.

The cats and bird cages are just a &#39;symptom&#39; of what it is all about, I guess. You really took on a BIG task with adopting this little one and you are also aware that there are more issues to be handled than you originally thought that there could be. I take off my hat for you and your courage.<br/>\n<br/>\nCats, birds, roads, toys, people, going in the car, eating, sleeping, changing clothes (Diapers), bathing and so on each pose a new set of conditions that you have certain expectations about and the little one has no clue what it is all about.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know waht, I wold just try to find a balance with one issue and only then look for finding a solution for the next and leave the rest out. Cats can look after themselves. Bird cages, if they are sturdy enough should be able to protect the inhabitants in a way, Food is really a &#39;no matter issue&#39; in the long run, diapers - how about letting them go and give her a no diaper, no pants time to get to enjoy her body (including some mud baths - sorry, you are still in winter time, no outside revelling in a mud pit yet. :) (Ariëlla arrived here today a mess after she had found a spot with REAL mud in and splashed it all over herself. Rain in Namibia gives the most amazing experiences for little ones! :)))  But maybe something similar. a big enough bowl to sit in and play with water and toys and splashing and getting cleaned up at the same time. A poo-mess on the floor is cleaned up so easily, too. And a potty can be kept around, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriëlla is a year old now. She started walking, too and can get wherever she wants to, also to the cat food bowls, which she loves taking apart and the cats who are to lethargic to move out of the way in time. Georg gives her a slap - Little baby big cry :) and Benny endures her pulling of parts of his fur with an unconditional patience.  She is learning. She is already keeping a healthy distance to Georg and shows still a lot of interest in exploring the mess around abilities with the other five cats of which some have the healthy self serving habit of staying out of her way.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, Ariëlla loves one of my bookcases. She just loves to pull the books out and starts nibbling on at least one of them. So I dedicated an obsolote book to her and keep that one around. When she gets near the book case I hand her her &#39;own&#39; book to do with as she desires and return the other books to their place, sometimes telling her that those are MY books. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow about having LOTS of Morgan things around to give her for exploring and enjoying when she starts exploring the exciting new place she lives in now? Stuffed birds, (You get them in talking versions, too :), lots of stuffed animals (they are so cheap from the Chinese shops) magazines to take apart, books you hate (I have a few that I can&#39;t burn but they are good enough for the baby :) and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I understand this unschoolong life style it is not really about being a good mother or parent but about finding ways to respect the current needs of our children and helping them to fulfil those. For your little one I guess a BIG need is to make sense of her new environment. TALK to her all the time and tell her ALL about what she is experiencing. Even if she is non verbalizing she picks up the vibes of information and communication and Connection and love and acceptance and LOVE and acknowledgement and hope and trust that you provide all the time, which you do from the previous posts I read about your adventure. And even if I am not a proponent of &#39;fixing&#39; any situation I would suggest that you learn EFT (emofree.com) and apply it in all those &#39;dire straights&#39; situations that come up each day. For your own sake and for her blessed future.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK Karen I deleted my next words because I felt that you would take umbrage again.<br/>\n I wrote &quot;Stop blaming the circumstances for all the things that don&#39;t work.&quot; Like the house and the mold and the finances or whatever. What is is. What you make of it is what you experience. You are the sole conductor of your experience. You can hate it or make peace with it. Hating it (or fighting or complaining about it) takes up so much of your valuable life energy. Is it really worth it? Isn&#39;t finding and designing workable solutions much more fun?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBlissings<br/>\nUlrike<br/>\nfrom Namibia - somewhere in Africa<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: was: diapers & medic Now: cats, and ki","postDate":"1203271455","msgId":29907,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4RkU4MjNBLUNFODQtNDlBMi1BREZBLUM5RkJFNzE5QTM4NEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwMjE3MDkzOWgxY2I3MjRmY25jZjI3YjRhMTI1YjNkODA1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwMjE3MDkyNHM1ZmZlYjUzN203YzllYjA3ZDVlM2NhNGE2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8ZnA5cjlvKzg4Z3NAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDw2N2E5ZDc1MDA4MDIxNzA5MzloMWNiNzI0ZmNuY2YyN2I0YTEyNWIzZDgwNUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29906,"nextInTopic":29913,"prevInTime":29906,"nextInTime":29908,"topicId":29853,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If what works is drilling a hole in a beam and hanging a cage from the ceiling than that is what works. If you found a solution that wasn&#39;t suggested, more power to you. But you don&#39;t have to attack everyone for not knowing that you have an asbestos riddled house or for making suggestions that don&#39;t work.

When my now-13-year-old son, Liam, was <br/>\nreally little he could be pretty aggressive with our old kitty.  He <br/>\nhad no malice whatsoever, but the principle of everyone, including <br/>\nour wonderful cat, being safe in the house was my biggest concern for <br/>\nme.  I felt it was not fair to the cat not to ensure his safety to <br/>\nthe best of my ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did was redirect Liam; rather than saying no, I&#39;d find <br/>\nsomething else that was at least as fun if not more fun to do.  That <br/>\ncould mean getting out of the house for a few minutes or for a longer <br/>\ntime.  Just something to change things up a bit.  I also made sure <br/>\nthe cat had a safe place to be.  And, I helped Liam find ways to love <br/>\nthe cat that weren&#39;t so scary for the cat.  I modeled better, more <br/>\ngentle ways of interacting with the cat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that cat passed on and we got a couple of younger cats, the <br/>\ncats&#39; safety was still a concern.  I did talk to Liam about my <br/>\nconcerns (he was probably 6 or 7 years old at the time), not in a <br/>\npunishing or shaming way. We talked about their safety and his safety <br/>\nand my safety, and I asked him what he thought we should do about <br/>\nmaking sure the cats are safe in their own home.  He agreed that <br/>\neveryone should be safe in the house, and he became much, much more <br/>\nrespectful of the cats&#39; autonomy.  Now, he is quite an advocate for the cats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should point out that I did consider finding another home for the <br/>\ncats, even temporarily, as unthinkable to me as that was.  I felt <br/>\nthat I needed to provide them with a safe home, and I had to be <br/>\nhonest with myself about whether or not I could do that.  I&#39;m glad it <br/>\nnever came to that, but it was on the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a process, to be sure, and I would never leave him alone with <br/>\nthe cat when he was little.
