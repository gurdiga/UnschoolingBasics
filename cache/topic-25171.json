Both offered opportunities for all of us to grow.  Both were driven by my son&#39;s need to have friends in the neighborhood no matter what.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt; One boy, in particular, has ALWAYS had to &quot;one up&quot; my son, yet my son is so desperate for friendships, (there are no homeschool groups in our area and he is not interested in group sports, etc.) that he puts up with it despite the fact that practically EVERY playdate they end up mad at each other.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n   <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  How does your son feel about this one-upping?  Ask him.  Pose the question and say nothing.  When the opportunity presents itself, tell him that you&#39;ve noticed that each time they play they end up angry.  Ask him why that happens.  Ask why he wants to befriend this child.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My son just ended a &quot;friendship&quot; with a 12 yo who hit him -- daily.  The &quot;first round&quot;, I caught the signs and we talked about what my ideas of what friendships really were, what it meant to be a friend, what I would and would not tolerate in a relationship, and possible resolutions to this boy&#39;s blows.  All I offered was clearly prefaced with *my* opinion, *I* think as I sincerely struggled to retain his freedom to choose what was next even though I wanted to go hit this kid myself (where you want to school).  He chose to confront this boy about the hitting and it stopped -- for a while.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; Should I allow my son to continue this so-called friendship? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n   <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  This is a tricky question.  As the first post said, it is *his* friendship and *his* path to choose.  In our situation I really needed to think through what to do.  I asked my son to take a 2 day break from seeing this boy.  He did, although I did &quot;state and wait&quot; when the boy appeared at our home.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  There was a second round of hitting.  This time I chose to limit to have play happen here, at our home only.  My son was *not* thrilled, but his safety was the core of the issue and he agreed.    <br/>\n<br/>\n  The hitting then happened when I wasn&#39;t immediately present.  With my son&#39;s agreement, enter the ever-present parent who sits on the floor reading a magazine and verbally interjects as needed.   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  As we continued to talk through what was and was not happening, what my son thoughts were, what my thoughts were, and oh so much more, my son felt empowered to stop hanging out with this boy, but sincerely needed my boundaries to empower himself to do it.  I did not a thing without his agreement and he has grown **tremendously** from it as a whole (as have dh & I and all of his siblings!!)  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  While it IS hard, take yourself out of it.  Try not to apply your life experience, but to offer it to your son as appropriate.  Focus on your son and his thoughts.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hth, <br/>\n  Jane <br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jane Powell <br/>\n  Tribe&#39;s Partner<br/>\n   <br/>\n  &quot;You must be the change you wish to see in the world.&quot; - Gandhi <br/>\n   <br/>\n  &quot;There is no right way to do the wrong thing.&quot; - unknown <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nShape Yahoo! in your own image.

That&#39;s where the<br/>\n&quot;desperate for friends&quot; comes in. He asks me DAILY if he can have a<br/>\nfriend come to play. It seems that playing with Dad & Mom is not enough.<br/>\nSummertime it&#39;s not as difficult, because the schooling friends are more<br/>\navailable.
