I <br/>\nfeel drawn towards unschooling, don&#39;t want any curricullum, want to be  child <br/>\nled in this learning adventure for my son, but as we all remember from my  <br/>\nprevious post about the spitting, I didn&#39;t handle that as well as I thought. I  <br/>\nstill have a lot to learn about being a more mindful parent. So I received a <br/>\nbit  of a wake-up slap on the wrist. What was actually the most helpful was the  <br/>\nreminder about the spitoons.... and it has made me realize I could have <br/>\nhandled  that better. Perhaps the next struggle will work out differently. <br/>\nObviously I  have not tucked tail and run off this list... in fact, last night I was <br/>\nwishing  for some insight how to handle another situation.  <br/>\nAnyway, still learning, still trying to better all aspects of the learning  <br/>\nin this household, both for the kids and for the adults working/parenting  them.<br/>\nthanks for the insights<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13946,"nextTopicId":13975}}
