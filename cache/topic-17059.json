I don t get less money to spend because I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-479667575\">A lot of people use age as a factor in determining how much money to give<br/>\ntheir kids but I&#39;ve never understood that.  I don&#39;t get less money to spend<br/>\nbecause I am younger than my husband.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we started giving our girls allowances (They were young, maybe 2 and 4)<br/>\nwe gave them the same amount based on what we felt would be enough money for<br/>\nthem to get to buy something they liked when we went to the store.  It<br/>\nwasn&#39;t much (I think we started with $1 a week) but we&#39;re not shoppers and<br/>\nby the time we went to a store they usually had a couple dollars at least<br/>\nand they were happy to spend it on candy or a small toy.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually we upped it to $2 and then to $4, which I am sure most of you<br/>\nthink isn&#39;t very much for a 9 and 11 year old but it works for us.  When we<br/>\ngo to the store on the way somewhere because dh wants a soda or a snack, we<br/>\nalways offer to get the kids something too.  They don&#39;t need to spend their<br/>\nmoney on candy or drinks or fast food if we are in the car and we&#39;re hungry<br/>\non the way some where.  We give them extra money for the fair or when we are<br/>\non vacation so they can go on rides or buy souvenirs. Dh works on the road<br/>\nfrequently and he has always liked bringing the girls home a souvenir when<br/>\nhe is on the road (at least once a month) but if he can&#39;t find something he<br/>\ngives them $5 or $10 just because he enjoys it.  It doesn&#39;t take them long<br/>\nto save for a $20 or $30 item.<br/>\n<br/>\nLilly buys some candy with hers but mostly both girls spend their money on<br/>\nhorse products. Leigh has several hundred dollars stashed away that she has<br/>\nsaved.  Sometimes they buy toy horse items and sometimes real horse items<br/>\nfor their horses.  We pay for everything the horses really need so the items<br/>\nthe girls buy for the horses are extra things, sometimes treats or a new<br/>\nlead rope, halter, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what it boils down to is that the kids are happy with the amount of<br/>\nmoney they have to spend when we do go shopping.  (did I tell you we all<br/>\nhate to go shopping unless it&#39;s to the tack store?)  They don&#39;t feel<br/>\ndeprived and we don&#39;t make them buy everything with their own money or we&#39;d<br/>\nhave to give them a lot more.  It feels nicer to be able to give them things<br/>\nmore often than if we gave them a large allowance and made them buy<br/>\neverything themselves.  I can give them the amount we do and not feel like<br/>\nit&#39;s making a huge dent in the budget.  On weeks where we don&#39;t have as much<br/>\nI make sure we have treats in the car so we don&#39;t need to stop and spend<br/>\nmoney on fast food or snacks but we always give them their allowance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle Leifur Reid","from":"&quot;Michelle Leifur Reid&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Money/allowance question","postDate":"1157290762","msgId":17063,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA5MDMwNjM5bTE5NTU0YWIwajUwZjQyNmM2Y2IyYWM5YmZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVkZWt2MyszaXJlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDM4MC0yMjAwNjkwMzEzNjM1ODI3QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+IDxlZGVrdjMrM2lyZUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":17062,"nextInTopic":17064,"prevInTime":17062,"nextInTime":17064,"topicId":17059,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
