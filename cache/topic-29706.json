They can calculate hit point averages, know <br/>\nhow much gold they need to buy what they want at the auction house. <br/>\nKnow how many copper it takes to make one gold. They can run a quest. <br/>\nMeaning follow directions and work within the guidelines of a guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are practicing high level thinking including statistics, <br/>\ninterpersonal relations and language development. They share some <br/>\nwonderful thing that has happened to them in a game or online daily. <br/>\nThey also have learned a fairbit about computer programing recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt our house we have three computers. I have seven kids sharing them.<br/>\nThere can be a moment of tension when someone wants to play and someone <br/>\nis still playing. We talk a lot about how each of us want to be treated <br/>\naround the game. We try to make sure each person gets what they are <br/>\nasking for.. That sometimes means they have to wait a bit, but that <br/>\nusually turns into watching your brother or sister defeat the guy they <br/>\nare battling and get the loot. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been radically unschooling for three years now. Meaning no <br/>\nlimits for games, tv, food, sleep. Only a policy of mutual respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when we began this journey lots more bickering about gaming <br/>\nand getting a turn. Not trusting that they would get what they needed. <br/>\nThat someone would block them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as emotional and hot tempers around the gaming. I have a very <br/>\nemotionally sensitive guy who still sometimes gets upset at what is <br/>\ngoing on in a game. He really needs for us to hear him and not stop him <br/>\nfrom expressing his frustration. I used to want to be correcting him, <br/>\nbut when a partner with him, just like I want when I have a bad time <br/>\nwith something, it turns around fairly quickly. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor younger sibs who have been the brundt of frustration sometimes it <br/>\nhelps to watch out for them. Help them know that the frustration is at <br/>\nthe game and not at them. Whenever I have asked my son, when he is done <br/>\nventing, if so and so is really an idiot &lt;or whatever&gt; the answer is <br/>\nalmost always no.. With a real sorry to the offended party. Not one <br/>\nthat has been forced or coerced.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also love that the kids have really learned how to support each other <br/>\nin their gaming. They will talk a game and understand each other all <br/>\nthe way through a meal. They patiently explain it to me. I am a big <br/>\nanimal crossing fan, but prefer to just watch the kids play other games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I just wanted to say that gaming has been a wonderful addition <br/>\nto our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":281487383,"authorName":"Kasey Frazier","from":"&quot;Kasey Frazier&quot; &lt;Fraziermk@...&gt;","profile":"moonchild_232002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Gameing Issue","postDate":"1203031069","msgId":29731,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZwMmk2dCsxMHRzdkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMjUwMWM4NmVlOCQ0ZWJmMGEzMCRlYzNkMWU5MCRAY29tLmF1Pg=="},"prevInTopic":29728,"nextInTopic":29735,"prevInTime":29730,"nextInTime":29732,"topicId":29706,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well thanks for all the positive responses it is better than on my one other list..

Last summer i found a whole set of them for one dollar a piece at the yard sale along with other games. I began to play them a little in my spare time I found. Jonah 7, began to watch and became interested in it and soon wanted to play. I did not think he would like it or be able to understand too much of it. I finally let him try it and lo and behold he loved it too! <br/>\n     The big surpise to me is that souly due to that game, he learned money. He learned that one needs to work to make money. He learned more about place value and how to read numbers! Big numbers! <br/>\n     I learned that we can&#39;t underestimate what or how a child can learn and this goes to both positive learning and negitive learning.

That&#39;s good.  As an <br/>\nextremely wise person told me once (Deb Lewis or Diana maybe?), the <br/>\nworld needs more passionate people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sentence you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;He seems to be only playing the game for the win and not for the <br/>\n&gt;pleasure of playing it<br/>\n&gt;anymore.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>suggests that you have a subjective opinion (redundant, I know) that <br/>\nhe *should* be playing these games for the pleasure of it.  But, <br/>\nthat&#39;s *your* opinion.  He&#39;s got his other reasons, and they are valid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;If he does not get to play if for some reason he also becomes very <br/>\n&gt;nasty and screams and stomps through the house.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would want to do that, too, if I couldn&#39;t do something that meant a <br/>\nlot to me.  Even more so if that thing were being deliberately <br/>\nwithheld from me!  If you can put yourself in his place, you&#39;ll see <br/>\nwhat I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We have done time constraints and days off and all of it...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But, by my lights, preventing him from doing something he loves <br/>\n*cannot* help him be happier.  It can only lead to resentment and a <br/>\nfeeling perhaps of insecurity and frustration in his own home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;...to letting him play as much as he wants.. It does not matter he <br/>\n&gt;is just plain ole&#39; nasty about the<br/>\n&gt;whole issue almost OCD over it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It could be that there is a new dimension for him of wondering when <br/>\nhe will be prevented from playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But being a parent that believes in unschooling and letting him lead<br/>\n&gt;the way it is seeming to be a challenge for me to just take it away.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fortunately, those are not your only two choices.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son, now 13, had a lot intense emotions around playing.  He still <br/>\ndoes, in fact.  He loves gaming and it broke my heart to see him be <br/>\nso upset over the games.  I couldn&#39;t comfort him, either, even though <br/>\nI wanted to so badly; my attempts to do that only made him feel <br/>\nworse.  I think it was because he couldn&#39;t retain his dignity; he <br/>\nneeded privacy to express his frustration.  I would have felt the <br/>\nsame way!  Plus, my need to fix things was interfering with his <br/>\nability to get what he needed to get from the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I ended up doing was:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Allow him the space and privacy he needed to feel his feelings <br/>\nwithout my interference, and<br/>\n2.  I helped him (and still do) wherever possible, whether it is <br/>\ngetting him the guide for the game or looking things up on the <br/>\nInternet.  This has made a huge difference, not only in his ability <br/>\nto be successful while playing the games, but also in our closeness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this is helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marji<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.joyfullyparenting.com\">http://www.joyfullyparenting.com</a><br/>\nLive Fully ~ Live JoyFully!<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"&quot;Karen Swanay&quot; &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Gameing Issue","postDate":"1202992109","msgId":29708,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwMjE0MDQyOHA0YTVlODVjZXE4M2JhYzI1ODQxYWZiZTMyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZwMG1sbCs3MjdmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZwMG1sbCs3MjdmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":29706,"nextInTopic":29709,"prevInTime":29707,"nextInTime":29709,"topicId":29706,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My boys are the same.
