That<br/>\nis where I am stuck, I don&#39;t see how I can meet everyone&#39;s needs<br/>\nrespectfully.  It seems like no matter what I do someone is upset (either<br/>\nyounger dd for having to get in her carseat, older dd for having to wait or<br/>\nnot go and me for being frustrated about the whole thing). I hate resorting<br/>\nto conventional strategies (yelling, bribing) but they are the methods that<br/>\nseem to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n***It is ok for the kids to be upset sometimes. Are you expecting everything<br/>\nto be happy and peaceful all the time? Are you expecting everyone to get<br/>\nalong and be sweet all the time? Are you expecting the kids to be mature<br/>\nenough to give generously to the other sibling all teh time? It is probably<br/>\nbest to let go of these kinds of thought, they will not serve you. Open your<br/>\nheart and eyes to all the good that you have and all the times that things<br/>\ngo smoothly. When dd is screaming about the carseat, take a breath, give<br/>\nthanks to the universe (or whatever) that she is alive and full of passion,<br/>\nsmile, maybe even laugh a bit, look for a way to be her partner. A way to<br/>\nhelp her be where she wants to be. It might take a few weeks or longer to<br/>\nget use to this kind of parenting. It can be challenging and take longer<br/>\nthan coercion. And it rarely will look like how you imagined it looking,<br/>\nlol.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t wait to see Dayna in person at the North East Unschooling conference<br/>\nin August, Rue too since I read her book.  I am hoping the conference will<br/>\ngive me more information and seeing unschooling families in action will be<br/>\ngreat.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I can&#39;t wait either. I love cons and Kathryn&#39;s is great fun.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you try a different brand or get a new car seat cover or a special<br/>\nsomething?<br/>\n<br/>\nOK I am slacking thte baby just peed in her pants.

Have someone else come over and hang out with her for a <br/>\nlittle, while you are out. That way, the whole process could be less <br/>\ntrausmatzing for the both of you! Eventually, she&#39;s going to have to get <br/>\ninto the car seat, &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried to arrange for someone to come for a few hours once a week so I can run out solo, but it hasn&#39;t been as consistent as I would like.  I try to run out in the evening after dinner or weekends when my dh is home, but then I feel bad that he is with the kids alone and doesn&#39;t get much time to himself.   Most of the time it isn&#39;t possible to keep her home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI find the time that it is most stressful is when I have to take or pick up my older dd from somewhere at a certain time.  We have cut back on outside activities to decrease that scenario, but I don&#39;t want to eliminate everything especially the things she really enjoys.  This is what frustrates me so much, I often feel that one of the girls gets short changed.  My older dd deserves to go to her activities or to the park if that is what we have decided to do.  I don&#39;t think it is fair to not do them simply because the younger one doesn&#39;t want to sit in her carseat.  If I decide not to go to avoid the carseat issue then the older one tantrums. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was watching Dayna Martin on YouTube yesterday.  She was talking about how unschooling allows for everyone&#39;s needs to be met in a respectful way.  That is where I am stuck, I don&#39;t see how I can meet everyone&#39;s needs respectfully.  It seems like no matter what I do someone is upset (either younger dd for having to get in her carseat, older dd for having to wait or not go and me for being frustrated about the whole thing). I hate resorting to conventional strategies (yelling, bribing) but they are the methods that seem to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t wait to see Dayna in person at the North East Unschooling conference in August, Rue too since I read her book.  I am hoping the conference will give me more information and seeing unschooling families in action will be great. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Not necessarily - if there&#39;s a way for her to stay home until she <br/>\nreaches the age/weight/height limit by law (which varies state to <br/>\nstate), she may never need to be in a carseat at all. Or, she may get to <br/>\nwhere a basic booster is adequate. &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately my younger dd is on the petite side (only 26 pounds) and she is almost 3 so I think she is going to be in the carseat for a long time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40276,"nextTopicId":40340}}
