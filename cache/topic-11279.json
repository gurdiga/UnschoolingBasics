Aaron rode with us up to the Live<br/>\nand Learn conference last year.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo, Aaron and his Dad were driving back to P&#39;cola and were in a<br/>\nbad car wreck near Hattiesburg. They were airlifted to Memphis and<br/>\nbeing cared for by both the hospital staff and local homeschoolers<br/>\n(hurray for the homeschooling community!).<br/>\nBoth of Aaron&#39;s legs and wrists are broken and he will need more<br/>\nsurgery when some swelling goes down. Richard (his Dad) has hip and<br/>\nleg injuries. It looks like they&#39;ll both be in wheelchairs for a while<br/>\nand Rose will have her hands full. They&#39;ll be in Memphis for at least<br/>\nthe rest of this week. I don&#39;t know when they&#39;ll return to P&#39;cola.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone would like to offer support, please email me offlist. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to get a big thread started, so please just write me<br/>\npersonally if you&#39;d like to reach out. I will be happy to pass along<br/>\ninformation to those that want it. I&#39;ve posted pics of Aaron at my<br/>\nblog, from last October....he&#39;s a really neat kid. I don&#39;t think Rose<br/>\nwill be reading here for some time, but I&#39;ll make sure any messages<br/>\nyou&#39;d like to forward get to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all,<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11269,"nextTopicId":11276}}
