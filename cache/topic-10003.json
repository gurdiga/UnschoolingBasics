I have gone &quot;into his world&quot; to &quot;see what he loves...&quot;<br/>\nmany times, especially when I&#39;ve gone into fear.  I am especially judgmental<br/>\nof things that don&#39;t look school-ish.  When I have gotten down with him,<br/>\nplayed and talked with awareness, I have learned quite a bit about why he<br/>\nspends time doing things that seem unimportant to me.  While you are there,<br/>\nyou can both learn a lot by talking to each other (see Jan Fortune-Woods<br/>\nlatest article in Life Learning Magazine &quot;Life, the Universe and<br/>\nEverything&quot;).  You can help him see connections, metaphors, you can ask<br/>\nquestions, and answer questions...let the talk take you from A to 10 where<br/>\nconnections never seemed to be possible.  Get to know each other better,<br/>\nfind out what you like to do together...then do it more.   Your fear of his<br/>\nfuture may be keeping you from being capable of being present with him.<br/>\n&quot;Trust&quot;...might be a good mantra...<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and another thing...what are YOU passionate about that he sees?  Even<br/>\nthe littlest passion in us is inspiring to them...but don&#39;t let this be an<br/>\nagenda to &quot;get&quot; him to do anything.  Just trust that if he is living around<br/>\npassionate people, he will recognize it in himself when it comes and know<br/>\nwhat to do with it...<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":241111941,"authorName":"ameliegoldstein","from":"&quot;ameliegoldstein&quot; &lt;ameliegoldstein@...&gt;","profile":"ameliegoldstein","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Still having problems with helping son find passion....","postDate":"1140035023","msgId":10009,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR0MDJrZitoMTlhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwMjE1MTIyMzIxLjQ1NzUwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzMDA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10003,"nextInTopic":10042,"prevInTime":10008,"nextInTime":10010,"topicId":10003,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t have much time, but I ve got two suggestions.

She is always writing, always<br/>\nplaying Zoo Tycoon, always spelling, saying math<br/>\nproblems allowed, etc.  I&#39;ll try it because you all<br/>\njust, ugh, cannot find the words.  When I wrote down<br/>\nmy list, I felt so guilty for &quot;making&quot; them do school<br/>\neven though it is short and fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDS 11, OTH, I&#39;m sorry to say that I could not honestly<br/>\nconjure up anything even remotely looking schoolish by<br/>\nwhat he does on his own, other than Garfield typing<br/>\nand Garfield quiz game, Harry Potter for reading. <br/>\nI&#39;ve never been a creative.  Most sites I go to for<br/>\ncreativity are geared for younger children and also<br/>\nmore for girls.  I&#39;ve got a woodshop book that I&#39;m<br/>\nhappy to do with him, but when I ask if he&#39;d like to<br/>\nmake something it&#39;s met with a casual, &quot;No, thats<br/>\nokay&quot;.  I do not make him feel bad at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe loves video games, and that is fine by me.  I asked<br/>\nhim if he&#39;d like to maybe be a video game creator, we<br/>\ncan get the software, etc.  &quot;No, that&#39;s okay.&quot;  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know, feeling at my wits end.  Maybe its just<br/>\ntaking longer for Zak to click with something and I<br/>\nshould probably stop worrying.  I want to help him,<br/>\nhelp him find his passion, but he has no desire for<br/>\nanything.  A few months back when I tried totally<br/>\nunschooling, it was me coming up with everything to<br/>\ndo, me always presenting ideas but never on his part. <br/>\nIf I didn&#39;t come up with something, he&#39;d just sit and<br/>\nlie around..unless he played something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love him for who he is today, but I can&#39;t lie and<br/>\nsay that I&#39;m not a little concerned about his future. <br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
