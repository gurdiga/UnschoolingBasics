Right now our living situation is probably what is causing so much extra stress, but as soon as we have our own place to live i will work on some of these - like cooking extra for t he week and such.<br/>\n  thanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">           &gt;I just don&#39;t get how I don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do the laundry or &quot;have to&quot; cook<br/>\n </span></blockquote>dinner. If I don&#39;t do these things it causes stress &gt;for<br/>\neveryone.....most of all me! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen think about why it causes stress. Stress is the result of some<br/>\nexpectation not being met/a difference between expectation and reality.<br/>\nWho&#39;s expectation is it? Where is it coming from? Who&#39;s &quot;should&quot; is it?<br/>\nDoes it &quot;have to&quot; be done NOW or can it be done later or differently or<br/>\nby someone else? <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, you &quot;could&quot; cook once a week (maybe take an afternoon<br/>\nwhile DH is available to play with/watch the kids and just take over the<br/>\nkitchen) and then just reheat pre-portioned amounts the rest of the<br/>\ntime. You &quot;could&quot; have every take out/delivery place in town on speed<br/>\ndial and never cook. You &quot;could&quot; hire someone to do the cooking. And so<br/>\non. You don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; -cook- dinner - pull out cheese, crackers,<br/>\nfruit, etc and have a cold buffet spread out. You &quot;could&quot; use a slow<br/>\ncooker and set up dinner at noon rather than at the end of the day.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve got a lovely rice cooker - add water and rice and hit ON and it&#39;ll<br/>\ndo the job and keep it warm once it&#39;s cooked for several hours. Pair<br/>\nthat with some re-heated, precooked chicken and microwaved frozen<br/>\nveggies and you&#39;ve got a decent meal with all of about 15 minutes work<br/>\n(although the chicken would need cooking previously - but that&#39;s easy<br/>\nenough to do some other day when you are preparing chicken for dinner -<br/>\ncook a couple extra pieces at the same time, takes the same amount of<br/>\ncooking time, and stash for a pull-out-of-the-fridge meal). Now that<br/>\nwinter&#39;s here, my hubby (the at home parent) will spend an afternoon<br/>\nmaking a big pot of soup which becomes dinner that night, lunches here<br/>\nand there the rest of the week and will get an addition of pasta or rice<br/>\nlater on to become a whole other meal (the soup and veggies act as<br/>\nflavoring for the starch portion). Another day, a pot of chili becomes<br/>\ndinner, subsequent lunches, and then topping for baked potatoes (which<br/>\nare toss in the oven for an hour, no attention required easy to do).<br/>\nOften, Saturday dinner becomes &quot;leftover night&quot; - assorted leftovers,<br/>\nalong with maybe a fresh salad or something, are set out and everyone<br/>\neats what they want. Sometimes, a double pancake batter is breakfast one<br/>\nday and dinner the next.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us (granted it&#39;s only 2 adults and 1 8 yr old), setting aside one<br/>\nday of the week as laundry day and doing it all at once works best, DH&#39;s<br/>\nchoice - DH and DS often just spend the day down in the finished<br/>\ngameroom area adjacent to the utility area of the basement so there&#39;s no<br/>\nup and down stairs. DH brings ALL the laundry down at once (mesh baskets<br/>\nthat get tossed down the stairs one at a time - they play &quot;Look out<br/>\nbelow&quot; where DH will &quot;yell&quot; look out below and toss the basket down,<br/>\nwhereupon DS will dash in and move that basket to make room for the next<br/>\none) and hauls them back up one or two at a time as they are done and<br/>\nhe&#39;s going that way (like to go up to the bathroom or to get food).<br/>\nFolding and putting away is a whole other task. None of us generally<br/>\nneed really crisply pressed stuff (I WOH fulltime but standard attire<br/>\nhere is jeans and tshirts/sweatshirts/flannel shirts, plus we tend<br/>\ntoward soft, no crinkle, no iron fabrics and perma press stuff that is<br/>\nfairly resistant to wrinkling. DS lives in sweatpants and tshirts most<br/>\nof the time for instance) - for that matter, our iron died a few years<br/>\nago and we haven&#39;t yet really missed it much.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think sometimes we get the idea that taking care of the<br/>\nhousework stuff and spending time with our kids are separate worlds.<br/>\nAfter all, that&#39;s likely what we&#39;ve seen and what we still see. &#39;Tain&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily so. Put in a movie and fold laundry or iron right there WITH<br/>\nthe kids. Include them in the food prep in some way - whether it&#39;s<br/>\nhands-on with the food stuffs or just keeping you company while you work<br/>\n(I spent many dinner prep times when DS was littler answering &quot;what&#39;s<br/>\nqrwtszynmx say Mommy?&quot; as he played with magnets on the fridge nearby).<br/>\nMore recently, I actually made a couple batches of a favorite sweet<br/>\n(pumpkin tassies - like mini muffin sized pumpkin pies) *while* also<br/>\nplaying Texas Hold&#39;em with DH and DS. I&#39;d check my cards initially<br/>\n(pause in stirring or scooping, nothing that can burn) then they&#39;d call<br/>\nout the community cards and I&#39;d tell them what I wanted to do - how much<br/>\nto bet, fold, check, whatever. I even won several hands -from a<br/>\ndistance-. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that the images we usually have of how a house &quot;should&quot;<br/>\nlook and what a mom &quot;should&quot; do are generally based on a scenario where<br/>\nthe kids are gone for 8 or more hours per day. It&#39;s not as difficult to<br/>\nclean the whole house, do laundry, and start dinner when it&#39;s just one<br/>\nadult with no other things going on for a long stretch of time. Then the<br/>\nkids get home, do homework, eat dinner, bath and pjs, then bed around 8<br/>\nor 9. So the comparison is invalid - you&#39;re comparing a home where there<br/>\nare active kids being and doing and exploring 24/7 and a home where kids<br/>\nare there, awake, and actively exploring for maybe 3 hours per day tops<br/>\nfor the better part of the week. You&#39;re kids do more *in the house* in<br/>\none day than the typical schooled kids do in almost a week. It&#39;s gonna<br/>\nlook a lot different than society&#39;s stereotypical &#39;soccer mom&#39;<br/>\nhousehold.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also look at your own &#39;hot spots&#39; - what one or two areas do<br/>\nyou need to have &quot;tidy&quot; in order to feel comfortable. For me, having my<br/>\ndesk area and the stove top clean are important, with the eating half of<br/>\nthe kitchen table second. If they are in order, I can cope better with<br/>\nother stuff. Maybe find a space or two that you can go tidy quickly and<br/>\nfeel more able to cope. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe invite a local teen to come play with the kids while you &quot;do&quot; one<br/>\nroom. Or trade kids with another mom. Or only &#39;maintain&#39; things<br/>\nbasically during the week then tag-team with spouse on a weekend<br/>\nmorning...that is, you do a room or a 15 minute chunk or what-have-you<br/>\nwhile spouse plays with/supervises the kids then you switch - spouse<br/>\ntakes on a task while you spend time with the kids. It&#39;s quite<br/>\nremarkable how much can get done in focused 15 minute spurts. There are<br/>\nlots of things, like flylady, which provide hints on how to get control<br/>\nof the housework stuff. We haven&#39;t gone there but I know there are folks<br/>\nwho take the basic ideas and modify them to fit their own<br/>\nlifestyle/preferences. Maybe set aside 15 minutes in the am, 15 minutes<br/>\naround lunchtime, and 15 minutes in the late afternoon as &quot;Mom stuff&quot;<br/>\ntimes - whether it&#39;s prepping dinner or throwing in a load of laundry,<br/>\nor dusting the living room (BTW old sweat socks with fabric marker faces<br/>\nand a spritz of your favorite dusting spray are cool &quot;Dust eating<br/>\nmonster&quot; hand puppets for the kids. My son also has a love of feather<br/>\ndusters and the Swiffer mopper thing). I know some folks who use all<br/>\nnon-toxic cleaners (based on things like vinegar and baking soda and<br/>\nsuch, rather than bleach or ammonia) so the kids can pitch in *safely*<br/>\nwhen they want to help. Young kids, especially, really want to help and<br/>\nbe &quot;like Mommy/Daddy&quot; if they can do it in their own time and manner.<br/>\nDusting all the blue things, then all the red things, and so on may not<br/>\nbe the way you&#39;d do it or the most efficient but if it is fun and gets<br/>\nthings done, go for it. Play games with it - give everyone a dustrag<br/>\n&quot;tail&quot;, put on some music, and shake your tailfeathers to dust (won&#39;t<br/>\nget the top of the entertainment center but with kids of various sizes<br/>\nyou can get a lot of shelves and such dusted nicely).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

What exactly could be more important than listening to my 9 yo proudly rattle off math facts (he just **shines**!!)??  What could be better than pausing to watch the red tailed hawk who landed on a neighbor&#39;s roof?  Figuring out that cardinal is the male, that&#39;s the female?  Listening to the noise as we throw rocks at a frozen lake?  Not a thing.  Tonight we drove around and looked at Christmas lights.  I did dishes and the kitchen at 11&#39;ish.  Wouldn&#39;t have traded a thing for the Christmas lights.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Pause.  Take a moment.  Look around you.  Really look.  Who exactly would perish if the laundry sat another day?  Do you *really* &quot;have to&quot;?  What exactly would happen if you didn&#39;t vacuum for one more day?  Is it something you *really* should do?  Change your view.  As they say on the show &quot;The View&quot;, &quot;Take a moment to enjoy the view.&quot;.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  TTFN, <br/>\n  Jane<br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jane Powell <br/>\n  Tribe&#39;s Partner<br/>\n   <br/>\n  &quot;You must be the change you wish to see in the world.&quot; - Gandhi <br/>\n   <br/>\n  &quot;There is no right way to do the wrong thing.&quot; - unknown <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

It shoudln&#39;t look like school.  School is<br/>\nthe opposite of what we are trying to accomplish here.

Get him books, puzzles, models, and videos on dinosaurs.

Get on the internet and find online exhibitions.<br/>\nMake a dino sculpture out of marshmallows and toothpicks (sticky and<br/>\nfun and lots of marshmallows get eaten).  Learn all the names of all<br/>\nthe dinosaurs and make it into a fun word game.  You could even (if<br/>\nthe opportunity lends itself) explain why a T.

If<br/>\nhe wouldn&#39;t get to scared (it scared me, but I&#39;m a weenie) watch<br/>\nJurassic Park with him.  He&#39;s going to learn the things he needs to<br/>\nlearn from all of that.  He will.  Trust it.  Trust him.

Out of the blue, <br/>\nshe asked &quot;what number is 5, 3, 1?&quot; So I told her &quot;five-hundred <br/>\nthirty one&quot; and kept folding laundry.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, this is one of Mo&#39;s new games, to fire off a string of numbers <br/>\nand have me tell her what it is. Its just something she does, almost <br/>\nexactly like when she was just wrapping her head around letters and <br/>\nsounds when she would give me strings of letters and want me to <br/>\npronounce them. With the numbers, on this particular day, she <br/>\nstarted out adding digets to the end of the string &quot;what&#39;s 5311, <br/>\nwhats 53111?&quot; and the little &quot;teacher voice&quot; in the back of my head <br/>\nsaid, okay, we&#39;re working on place value, here. Fine. I started <br/>\nwriting the numbers down in dry-erase marker on the front of the <br/>\nmicrowave, which sits on top of the dryer (gotta love dry-erase <br/>\npens!). Then she asked &quot;what&#39;s 631, what&#39;s 731?&quot; Okay, still working <br/>\non place value, but in a different way. &quot;What O&#39;clock is that?&quot; huh? <br/>\nI thought we were doing place value! I looked at the microwave in <br/>\nconfusion and noticed the time: 1:37. I told her the time and she <br/>\nfrowned at me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went and got the &quot;practice clock&quot; - its one where you move the <br/>\nminute hand and the hour hand moves, too. I set that to the same <br/>\ntime as the digital on the microwave. In the past I&#39;ve tried <br/>\nexplaining that the numbers mean something different for the &quot;big <br/>\nhand&quot; but she hasn&#39;t been interested, so this time I offered to get <br/>\nmy new watch to look at, too. Its analog and it has the minutes <br/>\nwritten in tiny little numbers around the outside (and its pink with <br/>\nlots of buckles, in case you wanted to know). <br/>\n<br/>\nShe looked at the watch and the clock and the microwave.<br/>\n&quot;I want to write two o&#39;clock&quot; she announced. I moved the laundry <br/>\nbasket and handed her the dry-erase pen. She wrote 2 12 and then <br/>\nwent and set the practice clock to the correct time, short hand <br/>\npointing at the two, long hand to the 12. <br/>\n&quot;Well, this is how this clock will say it&quot; it pointed to the <br/>\nmicrowave&#39;s clock and wrote 2:00 above it, saying &quot;o&#39;clock&quot; as I <br/>\nwrote the zeros. &quot;The dots tell us its a time.&quot; <br/>\n&quot;I want to write it again!&quot; I handed back the pen. She wiped out all <br/>\nthe numbers and wrote: 00:2 and next to it &quot;too oclook&quot; I pronounced <br/>\nthe oclook for her so she could hear the &quot;oo&quot; and changed the second <br/>\no to a c - which she made a joke about, but she&#39;s seen ck&#39;s plenty <br/>\nof times in books, and I know she&#39;s aware of that spelling <br/>\nconvention. Her attention shifted to playing with words and sounds, <br/>\nanother favorite game. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kids are infinately curious and love to learn.

I&#39;d encourage you to read as much as you can <br/>\nabout unschooling, here and at the links.  You&#39;ll find all kinds of <br/>\nstories about how kids learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, if your son was in school for 8 weeks, he hasn&#39;t been <br/>\nout very long since then.  He obviously still has memories of how <br/>\nmiserable he was and probably won&#39;t want to do anything like what he <br/>\ndid in school.  And some people (kids AND adults) will never ever <br/>\nenjoy a word search.  My daughter is nearly 12 now and has rarely <br/>\nput anything on paper.  She has never wanted a workbook or a word <br/>\nsearch or anything of that sort.  However, she is starting to write <br/>\na lot on the computer - stories & such.  She loves to read and can <br/>\nwrite amazingly well with correct grammar and all.  And she&#39;s never <br/>\ntouched a workbook in her life!  How can that be?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as you and your husband feeling comfortable with the notion <br/>\nof unschooling, perhaps you could give yourself a certain amount of <br/>\ntime that you won&#39;t worry about &quot;education&quot;.  Tell yourself that you <br/>\nwon&#39;t worry about it for until he&#39;s six or something.  Just have as <br/>\nmuch fun with him and your little ones as you can for that amount of <br/>\ntime.  Let him watch documentaries, find some dinosaur books and <br/>\ntoys, go to the park with the babies, whatever you can manage.  <br/>\nThen, when that amount of time is up, ask yourself how things are <br/>\ngoing?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd try not to quiz him about what he&#39;s learned from what he&#39;s <br/>\nwatched or played or whatever.  If he feels like it&#39;s a test, he may <br/>\ncome to dread even his beloved dinosaur show.  As someone else <br/>\nmentioned, he&#39;s only 5.  That may seem big to you, but in most <br/>\nstates, kids are not required to attend school at that age.  Here in <br/>\nWashington, I don&#39;t even have to send a letter of intent until my <br/>\nchild is 8 years old.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you or your husband have any more specific questions, I&#39;m sure <br/>\nwe&#39;d be happy to address those too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Christy M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":216914372,"authorName":"riasplace3","from":"&quot;riasplace3&quot; &lt;riasplace3@...&gt;","profile":"riasplace3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Ponderings from a newbie:  5yo&#39;s learning","postDate":"1165936569","msgId":19653,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVsbWgzcCtiZzR0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVsbTNqbSszdW5qQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19651,"nextInTopic":19658,"prevInTime":19652,"nextInTime":19654,"topicId":19646,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m looking for advice or <br/>\nencouragement or just putting my situation out here for others to comment on...<br/>\n<br/>\nBrief background: I&#39;ve planned on Homeschooling since before having kids; recently <br/>\nbecame aware of unschooling during the past year.  Due to certain situations, my son <br/>\nstarted kindergarten at the public school this fall.  Saw a lot of old issues I thought we had <br/>\ngotten past resurface as well as new issues develope w/behavior, attitude, self-<br/>\nconfidence, etc.  After 8 weeks, I convinced dh to let me remove ds from school, as well as <br/>\ntake an unschooling approach at home. But...he&#39;s somewhat skeptical about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...for the past many weeks we have not done any formal lessons, etc. at home.  But...I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen feeling lately like we really need to do some &quot;schoolish&quot; things, so I got out a few <br/>\nthings and sat down w/ds and explained what we needed to do.  My 3yo son joined us and <br/>\nfollowed directions perfectly; my 5yo followed directions up to a point and then veered off, <br/>\ndoing his own things with the materials I gave him.  I explained several times what &quot;we&quot; <br/>\nwere trying to acomplish and what he needed to do next, and then he finally said, &quot;I&#39;m so <br/>\nmiserable! This is how I feel in school!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoa.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so we stopped doing that and got out a dinosaur word search - (he&#39;s REALLY into <br/>\ndinosaurs right now). After a few minutes of trying to work on that together, he again said <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m so miserable&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so now I&#39;M frustrated.  This is all very new to me. While I believe in and would like to <br/>\ntry an unschooling approach, I am not one of those moms who can &quot;make every moment a <br/>\nlearning opportunity&quot; (as I&#39;ve read other people comment on other unschooling boards), so <br/>\nI feel like he&#39;s missing out if I don&#39;t try to sit down and do some sort of &quot;lessons&quot; with him.  <br/>\nBut it obviously wasn&#39;t working, because we were both getting frustrated and he wasn&#39;t <br/>\nlearning anything anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could feel myself starting to get annoyed and angry, because he wasn&#39;t doing his part in <br/>\nmy little scenario of having a &quot;lesson&quot; to fill my need of feeling like were accomplishing <br/>\nsomething &quot;educational&quot;.  Fortunately, I caught myself in time and said &quot;okay, this isn&#39;t <br/>\nworking&quot;.  I then put on a two hour documentary from the Discovery Channel called <br/>\n&quot;Before the Dinosaus&quot;. (He really likes documentaries!?)  After he watched it, I asked what <br/>\nit was about.  He basically described evolution to me: how life started off in the oceans, <br/>\nhow they turned to fishes, which turned into reptiles, which came up on land and <br/>\neventually turned into dinosaurs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a heck of a lot more than he would have learned from my  little dinosaur word <br/>\nsearch.<br/>\n<br/>\nZack loves documentaries and he&#39;s actually learned an amazing amount from them. I <br/>\nguess the thing I am struggling with is this: how much of his education should he get from <br/>\nthese types of programs? Is it okay if I&#39;m not a very central figure in his education at this <br/>\nyoung of an age? I have several skeptics in my family, and sometimes their attitude rubs <br/>\noff on me...how can I fell comfortable with  this process when it seems we&#39;re not really <br/>\ndoing anything &quot;educational&quot;? I have two other children younger than Zack, and many days <br/>\nI still feel like I&#39;m just operating in &quot;survival&quot; mode...which adds to my concern that I&#39;m not <br/>\ndevoting enough time to helping Zack get what he needs...<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts/comments?<br/>\n<br/>\nTami</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19786,"nextTopicId":19636}}
