(www.unerzogen-magazine.de)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m Johanna from Leipzig, Germany. I write for the &quot;unerzogen Magazin&quot;, a print magazine about unschooling, democratic education and respectful parenting. We look for German authors and interview partners mostly, but we also look abroad and then translate. Sometimes it&#39;s the well known authors, and sometimes we look for &quot;fresh&quot; authors. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur next issue is all about informal learning and/or learning through play / the importance of play (playing?) for children (and/or their development). <br/>\n<br/>\nFor our Unschooling section, we are looking for an author who can write from the unschooling perspective, either with his or her own experience with the kids - or maybe someone who has experience with both: schooling and then unschooling, and maybe formerlly forced kids to do lots of &quot;learning&quot; and is now just learning to let go and has some interesting experiences to share about how important the playing of the kids is, especially compared to the schoolish learning. Something like that - or maybe something different that you come up with! There might be someone who has contact to older kids who would like to be interviewed or want to share their experience with playing or... maybe someone has read books about the importance of play and can summarize in an article the best of it. It can be in a theoretical style, or more with your own experiences from the plain point of view of a parent; it can be philosophical...<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope someone understands somewhat we are looking for. Maybe you don&#39;t write yourself but have an idea for us - please send us a name and contact! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information or if you want write for us, please send an e-mail to: <br/>\n<br/>\njohanna . gundermann @ unerzogen - magazine . de (without the blanks of course)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest<br/>\nJohanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44599,"nextTopicId":44611}}
