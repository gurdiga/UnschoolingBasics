I can&#39;t see how any school can provide the environment where every child is totally respected at all times.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my &#39;baby&#39; came home one day and told me that he was bullied in recess and when he told the teacher about it he was told to not lie I took him out the next day (This was the proverbial drop of course) and we went from a desperately unhappy and sick child to a singing and dancing and creative child in a short time. <br/>\nAnd I have not a single other unschooling family in my area. I just chose his happiness and health over societal pressure. And he is growing up into a wise and beautiful human person.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlissings<br/>\nUlrike Haupt<br/>\nfrom Namibia - somewhere in Africa<br/>\nPS - He can be a bully at times but since I am around I can keep an eye open and steer the situations if needed which would have been impossible if he was in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39201,"nextTopicId":39211}}
