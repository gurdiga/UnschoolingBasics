You&#39;re receiving it because you work with (or raise!) such teens.  Please forward this to any teens, parents, groups, or e-mail lists who might be interested. <br/>\nThanks for your help!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Blake<br/>\nDirector, Unschool Adventures<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blake@...\">blake@...</a><br/>\n541-728-3227<br/>\n_________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAttention teen unschoolers!  Unschool Adventures proudly announces three new programs for 2011:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMay 2011: Southwest Art Intensive  (2 weeks, ages 14-18, $1600)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you passionate about creating visual art? Are you interested in selling your artwork? Do you already possess artistic skills but are unsure about how to take your work to the next level of professionalism? Are you looking for new artistic media to explore?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoin ten other unschoolers for two weeks in the stunning art mecca of Santa Fe, New Mexico for the Southwest Art Intensive.  This “sampler platter” program will expose you to glassblowing, fiber arts, ceramics, photography, drawing & painting, wood & metal work, and paper art—and the real lives of artists who do it for a living.  You’ll also gain insights on how to start and run your own artistic business as well as continue your artist’s self-education after the program concludes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn more: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooladventures.com/?page=trips/art11\">http://www.unschooladventures.com/?page=trips/art11</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJuly-August 2011: Eurosurf  (6 weeks, ages 18-20, $4500)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you’re going to backpack around Europe, why follow the beaten path?  Eurosurf instead!  For six weeks our group of young adults will travel around Western Europe using Couchsurfing to meet and stay with neat European hosts.  When hosts are not available, we’ll stay at hostels.  By exploring Europe this way we’ll get a truly local perspective, make dozens of new internationals friends, and have a blast in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOur European itinerary will include both &quot;must-see&quot; tourist destinations (e.g. Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Colosseum) and lesser-known destinations suggested by our Couchsurfing hosts. There will be lots of flexibility in our choice of destinations, lengths of stay, and activities.  There will also be a big focus on food and cooking, so be prepared to learn new foreign recipes and do a lot of taste testing!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn more: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooladventures.com/?page=trips/euro11\">http://www.unschooladventures.com/?page=trips/euro11</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOctober 2011: The Autodidact Adventure & College Without College  (2/4 weeks, ages 14-20, $1700/$2900)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Autodidact Adventure is an exciting, hands-on, and high-energy introduction to &quot;hacking&quot; your education.  Held in beautiful Ashland, Oregon, this adventure will show you how meet and learn from fascinating people, set goals, turn failures around, and become a highly efficient self-directed learner.  You design the days, and the evenings are filled with fascinating leadership workshops.  Special events include a high ropes course, Oregon Shakespeare Festival, talent show, scavenger hunt, and more!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf college is on your radar, join us for an additional two weeks with the “College Without College” program.  You’ll learn how to take advantage of college resources, students, and professors as a non-enrolled &quot;independent scholar”—potentially saving thousands of dollars on future college tuition.  A 4-day field trip to Portland is included.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn more: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooladventures.com/?page=trips/auto11\">http://www.unschooladventures.com/?page=trips/auto11</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* * *<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other news, the South America trip (Jan-Mar 2011) is full, and there is one spot left on the Fall Leadership Retreat (for ages 18-20).
