He<br/>\n  wanted to know if I thought a relationship started at age 15 could be <br/>\n&quot;the one.&quot;<br/>\n  His girlfriend recently went off to college so they&#39;re dealing with <br/>\nseparation<br/>\n  issues. Since I met my dh at 15 I told him what I&#39;ve found to be true <br/>\nfor us. We<br/>\n  did end up being the one for each other, but we needed time apart to <br/>\ndiscover<br/>\n  our own selves as well. I told him it sucked, but it was the best <br/>\nthing we ever<br/>\n did for our longterm relationship. I like to be honest.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n That 18 year old was my Cameron.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;ve talked a LOT about this. He and Carly are quite serious: they&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen dating for 3.5 years. People change so much from 18-25. I&#39;ve <br/>\nsuggested that he give it time. She&#39;s not truly on board with <br/>\nunschooling or our lifestyle (although she LOVES to spend time here and <br/>\nis always angry with her mom and wishes that RUE was her mother <br/>\ninstead! &lt;G&gt;). She still thinks that children need school. And that <br/>\nthey need rules. But that&#39;s how *her* life has been.<br/>\n<br/>\n She&#39;d rather have had Cam&#39;s life, but...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Her father died four years ago, and her parents&#39; marriage was rocky <br/>\nthen at best. Seeing my relationship with Ben has been really good for <br/>\nher. (So her mom tells me.) She&#39;d never seen spouses really get along.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When they first started dating, her mom didn&#39;t like Cam because she <br/>\n*knew* he&#39;d be worthless and stupid for being UNschooled. He&#39;s... <br/>\nuh...changed her mind a bit! &lt;G&gt; She adores him now! He&#39;s respectful <br/>\nand kind and generous and cares sooo much for Carly. But he has no <br/>\nproblem standing up for himself OR Carly in front of her mother. Kinda <br/>\ncool. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  He&#39;s having lunch with her soon, I think, and will give her Rue&#39;s book <br/>\nand tell her that it&#39;s NOT too late to repair her relationship with her <br/>\ndaughter. (Yikes! Where&#39;d he get those balls??? &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  The big issues *I* see are the strained relationship with her mom, our <br/>\nunschooling lifestyle, college---it changes people, and distance <br/>\n(currently she&#39;s 1.5 hours away).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, that and Ren&#39;s desperate need to hook Cameron up with Brenna! <br/>\n&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do I think young relationships can work longterm? You bet. I&#39;ve seen <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do I think people change a great deal from 18-15? You bet! I&#39;ve seen <br/>\nit, and I did!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do I think relationships can survive long distance? You bet. Ben and I <br/>\ndid it!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think people with more similar backgrounds may have it easier---and <br/>\nI guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m more concerned about. Our unschooling <br/>\nbackground may make it hard to jive with a more conservative, <br/>\nrule-based background.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think Cameron and Carly could work this out for the long-term, but I <br/>\nhave suggested that they take their time and not marry right away. They <br/>\nmay or may not take my &quot;sage&quot; advice. &lt;bwg&gt; Either way, I&#39;ll stand <br/>\nbehind them. We love Carly and feel she&#39;s already part of the family.<br/>\n<br/>\n We&#39;ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n Conference Coordinator<br/>\n Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;It&#39;s a small world...but a BIG life!&quot; ~Aaron McGlohn. aged 6<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.

(We finally did meet at age 24).  We <br/>\n&gt; speculated about how we each were at ages 15-18, and concluded that if we <br/>\n&gt; had met back then, we&#39;d have hit it off just as well as we did at 24.<br/>\n&gt; However, in our society, the expectation is that you wait until you&#39;re at <br/>\n&gt; least as old as Methusela until you THINK of finding &quot;the one&quot;.  Even when <br/>\n&gt; we got married at age 26, people still told us we were too young.  The <br/>\n&gt; expectation is that you definitely don&#39;t marry the one you date when you are <br/>\n&gt; in your mid to late teens, and if you do, the marriage is doomed for sure.<br/>\n&gt; I looked at zenmomma&#39;s pictures from the confrence on her blog, and there&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; one pic there where a couple of the teens look like they kind of like each <br/>\n&gt; other.  It got me thinking.  Unschooling parents are champions at following <br/>\n&gt; their child&#39;s lead, treating their opinions with respect, and validating <br/>\n&gt; their kids&#39; experiences.  That being said, what if your teen was dating <br/>\n&gt; someone for quite sometime, and then someitme around age 16-19 ish, told you <br/>\n&gt; that this person was &quot;the one&quot;?  Both of them were sure of it?  Would you <br/>\n&gt; support that, or would you lean towards the societal expectation that teen <br/>\n&gt; relationships can&#39;t survive?  Unschoolers seem to me like they would mostly <br/>\n&gt; support their child, and believe them when they say that that person is &quot;the <br/>\n&gt; one&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s your take?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Danielle Souris Pate<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I shall be telling this with a sigh<br/>\n&gt; Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>\n&gt; Two roads diverged in a wood, and I�<br/>\n&gt; I took the one less traveled by&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Robert Frost.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Got something to buy, sell or swap?

I think it runs in my family <br/>\nmaybe - I was 32/33 when I got married and DH is 8 yrs younger; my <br/>\nbrother is 1 1/2 yrs younger than I am and he married at about 32 to <br/>\nsomeone a decade younger; my sister is 5 yrs younger than I am and <br/>\nmarried at 27 to someone who is slightly older than I am (if you&#39;re <br/>\nfollowing the math, I got married then 7 months later my sister got <br/>\nmarried then 1 1/2 years after her my brother got married); my dad <br/>\nwas 29 when he married mom, she was 22. On the other hand, DH&#39;s mom <br/>\nand dad married right after his mom graduated high school, his dad <br/>\nis about 5 years older I think (he was out of college and in the Air <br/>\nForce by the time they married so that&#39;s probably a pretty close <br/>\nguess). DH&#39;s sister #1 (2 yrs younger than he is) married at 27/28 <br/>\n(not sure how old her hubby is - his DD from a previous marriage was <br/>\nabout 8 at the wedding so he was somewhere upward of 26 at the <br/>\ntime). DH&#39;s sister #2 is about 23 now and has had several <br/>\nrelationships that lasted from months to years since she was &quot;high <br/>\nschool age&quot; (MIL homeschooled both #2 and #3 for middle school/high <br/>\nschool).

We <br/>\nmarried 2 years later without telling anyone (for a few years they just <br/>\nthought we were living together). This December will be our 13th wedding <br/>\nanniversary and I feel like we&#39;re still going strong...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if I were to look at my child when he is older and dating (he&#39;s only <br/>\n2.5 right now) I would look at it from the perspective that I am trying to <br/>\ndevelop now. That is, I would trust his feelings and we would talk about <br/>\nthings in depth - including the idea of marriage. My dh and I didn&#39;t get <br/>\nmarried because we felt it would strengthen our relationship or for <br/>\nreligious reasons or anything like that - we just got married because his <br/>\njob had very good health benefits and there were no domestic partner <br/>\nbenefits at that time (we were living in Ohio). Therefore, I think I would <br/>\nbring up all the ideas of marriage in our society and see how he feels about <br/>\nthem - along with the idea that people can be together for many years (even <br/>\na lifetime) and never be married. We know several couples like this - gay <br/>\nand straight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the idea of &quot;the one&quot;, I wouldn&#39;t negate his opinion on it because <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen that backfire in my own family with my mother trying to control my <br/>\nand my brothers&#39; relationships during high school. Whenever she started to <br/>\ndeny the feelings we had that a particular person was &quot;the one&quot;, it only <br/>\nbrought us closer together with that person and it was harder to determine <br/>\nfor ourselves that maybe this person wasn&#39;t &quot;the one&quot; later when the <br/>\nrelationship was rocky. In essence, mom fighting our feelings strengthened <br/>\nthe bond between this person and one of us (me or my brothers) as a united <br/>\nfront against my mother. The relationship ended up lasting far longer than <br/>\nit probably would have if she hadn&#39;t interfered - probably just because we <br/>\nfelt like we needed to prove her wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen looking at a lot of society&#39;s ideas of age regarding different <br/>\nactivities (dating, marriage, drinking, driving, voting, having children, <br/>\ngoing off to war, etc.), age is so arbitrary. Some &quot;adults&quot; (even the idea <br/>\nof 18 as when someone becomes an adult) are not ready for many of these <br/>\nactivities well into their adulthood and many teenagers surprise us with <br/>\ntheir abilities to handle many of these things very well. As with all things <br/>\nunschooling (as far as I&#39;ve come to understand it all), I think it comes <br/>\ndown to knowing your child and what their life experience has helped them <br/>\nunderstand - and being there as a parent in case things don&#39;t go as they <br/>\nplanned.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLesa O&#39;Daniel, AAHCC<br/>\nInstructor, Bradley Method� of Natural Childbirth<br/>\n323-541-5515<br/>\nhttp://www.bradleybirth.com/ndweb.asp?ID=O123&Count=N<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: SquishyMommy1@...<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt;To: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] How would you feel?<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 14 Sep 2006 12:09:26 EDT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would totally support that, but me and my hubby are HS   sweethearts (met<br/>\n&gt;at 14 and 15) and we got married when i was 19 he was  20.
