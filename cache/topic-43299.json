And to hang out in one of the most beautiful cities in North America, of course!  During the gathering, Montreal will even be hosting the International Jazz Festival (note that despite it&#39;s name, you can find a variety of different musical styles at this festival), which boasts a huge amount of high profile, and lesser known but very talented, musicians and musical acts, with a wealth of free concerts!  Montreal truly comes alive in the Summer, and it&#39;s a great time to visit the city.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor lots more info, and to let us know if you&#39;re interested in coming, please join our Yahoo! group: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SMUG_unschoolersgathering/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SMUG_unschoolersgathering/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re really excited about this event, and hoping you can join us!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie Smart & Idzie Desmarais</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43220,"nextTopicId":43301}}
