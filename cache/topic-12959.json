Actually, it&#39;s kind of funny, because I read it while on <br/>\nthe bus traveling with a public school on a field trip to Chicago.  <br/>\nWhat restraint it took to not stand up and shout to every child there <br/>\nwhat it was I was learning.  If the school staff only knew! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI did try reading it with Amie, 16-year-old, before she came home, but <br/>\nfor whatever reason I couldn&#39;t hold her attention with it.  In a <br/>\nperfect world we would have read it as a family.  I was SO excited <br/>\nwhen I read it!  In fact, I just purchased it for my step-sister who <br/>\nlives in Wisconsin and recently decided to take her two children, 14 <br/>\nand 16, out of public school after this school year.  She was just <br/>\nhere this past weekend.  We live in Michigan, and she drove 12 hours <br/>\nto attend our oldest&#39;s baby shower.  What a die hard she is!  :-)  Oh, <br/>\nI also let her borrow Valerie&#39;s book, &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot;, which I <br/>\ntotally loved by the way.  Oh...had I only known life could be so <br/>\ndifferent before I had already graduated FOUR children from public <br/>\nschool and tormented three others to variant degrees with <br/>\nthe &quot;system&quot;.
