We live near Seattle and our bird visitor was from <br/>\nCanada.  It had been a really hot week and this little guy was just <br/>\nexhausted.  We kept him for over a week in a large dog crate outside <br/>\nand kept him fed,watered and safe from other animals. <br/>\n<br/>\n When I finally contacted the owner, she said that if I could get him <br/>\nas close to his home as possible, I could just release him and he&#39;d <br/>\ncome home.  She asked me not to release him from my home since he had <br/>\nbeen staying there awhile and was being fed so he might not want to <br/>\nleave.  We ended up driving the bird near the border and released <br/>\nhim.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow far away is his home from you?  From our experience and talking <br/>\nwith the owner, I think if you just continue keeping it safe, fed and <br/>\nwatered for a few days it should be able to continue on home.  The <br/>\nowner also asked us to release him either in the early morning or <br/>\nevening to keep him from flying during the heat of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH,<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Caren Knox-Hundley <br/>\n&lt;carenkh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi -<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We were visited yesterday by a homing pigeon! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151505017,"authorName":"Caren Knox-Hundley","from":"Caren Knox-Hundley &lt;carenkh@...&gt;","profile":"carenkh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"pigeon keepers?","postDate":"1187789464","msgId":25936,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU4MEQyRDg5LTZFMDUtNDUxNi05RkIzLUFFMUE4MjQwNzM2NUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25941,"prevInTime":25935,"nextInTime":25937,"topicId":25936,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi - We were visited yesterday by a homing pigeon!

She (or he?) showed up  <br/>\non our windowsill and was just hanging out.  Since it was 100 degrees  <br/>\nyesterday, I thought I&#39;d take it some water, even if that scared it  <br/>\naway.  It didn&#39;t scare!  As I poured the water into the dish, the  <br/>\nbird hopped right up to it - very close to me - and had a drink.   <br/>\nThat&#39;s when I saw the bands on its legs.  I googled &quot;I found a  <br/>\npigeon&quot; and through various sites, I learned that the bird was  <br/>\nprobably tired, and if I could, we should keep it comfy for a day or  <br/>\ntwo, then release it.  We settled the bird into a kitty carrier, and  <br/>\nshe spent the night.  I found the originating club that released the  <br/>\npigeon - but the person who can look up the owner of the bird is on  <br/>\nvacation &#39;til September 5th!  I&#39;m really not sure what to do, now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like it&#39;s too hot to release the bird.  I was writing to see  <br/>\nif someone on the list kept homing pigeons, and what you might  <br/>\nsuggest I do.  I have a dog and three cats, so the bird is tucked  <br/>\naway in my room with the door closed - if they&#39;re social birds, it  <br/>\nseems like that would be stressful for it.  It is eating the seed I  <br/>\nput in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nCaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25866,"nextTopicId":7717}}
