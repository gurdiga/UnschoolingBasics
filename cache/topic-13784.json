(You all -- not  <br/>\ny&#39;all -- this is a NORTHEAST conference.)  I had a really, really, really  good <br/>\ntime this weekend!<br/>\n <br/>\nConference planning and running is exhausting, and this one certainly was.  <br/>\nAnd it can be stressfull, and there were moments of that too. But I have to say <br/>\n the atmosphere and energy at this conference was amazing and spectacular and <br/>\n sweet and loving and fun and supportive. <br/>\n <br/>\nFrom new unschoolers to oldtimers, from gorgeous wee babes to those  hugging, <br/>\nfunny teens to caring and working and playing moms and dads, you were  open <br/>\nto learning new things, to laughing and finding the joy, and creating  <br/>\ncommunity.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome moments stand out for me: The glowing, lovely Jillian, who charmed all  <br/>\nof us, along with her very cool mama Angel; Our Famous Ren, who along with  <br/>\nher two talks and Funshop, also made many of us up for hours, creating an  <br/>\ninteresting new look for Ben Lovejoy and butterflies for young admirers; the  <br/>\nunrelenting, albeit odd, loving support of Jon Kream, and the spectacular arts  and <br/>\ncrafts room from Rue; the hugs and knowing of Ben and Kelly; the way 25-30  <br/>\npeople happily worked together to clean the arts and crafts room in less time  <br/>\nthan we could have imagined; watching Julian spend blissful time with loving  <br/>\nlooks with his first love; the really neat conference &#39;zine, the DOZENS of  <br/>\npeople who told me and Beth that this has changed their lives....   Wow...<br/>\n <br/>\nYou are all amazing and I love you all.<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13775,"nextTopicId":13224}}
