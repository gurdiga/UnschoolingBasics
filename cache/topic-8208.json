Comments like:  how will those kids EVER learn math?  <br/>\npass the GED or score well on the SATs?  attain the discipline to <br/>\nstick with the &quot;un-fun&quot; tasks of life? Won&#39;t they become selfish and <br/>\nlazy always doing only what they&#39;re interested in?? The list goes <br/>\non.  (Please forgive my ignorance:-(<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I didn&#39;t actually KNOW any unschooling families, nor had I <br/>\nbothered to learn anything about the lifestyle.....but because I was <br/>\nunsure of myself (I was a curriculum junkie), I had to validate what <br/>\nI was doing.  Somehow it seemed like it would be more acceptable to <br/>\nmy critics if I painted a picture of the kids and I sitting around <br/>\nthe kitchen table with our workbooks -- or me standing at a <br/>\nchalkboard teaching them &quot;lessons.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nUgh.  Painful, but I guess taking responsibility for our <br/>\nmistakes/ignorance and doing our best to correct them/it is part of <br/>\n(like grandma used to say) growing older and wiser.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSharon</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227522899,"authorName":"camden","from":"camden &lt;ccoutlaw@...&gt;","profile":"ccoutlaw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Question WAS:   What do you think?
