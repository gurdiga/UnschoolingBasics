She&#39;s<br/>\nbeen on the march a long time, you know. And look at her  rag-tag<br/>\nlittle classroom! All she has has for pupils are you and me. Dumb<br/>\nlittle class. Listen! The drum beat isn&#39;t even regular. Everyone is<br/>\nout of step. And there! You see?  She keeps stopping along the way to<br/>\npick up one of her tinier pupils who decided to wander off and play<br/>\nwith a frog, or run in a field, or whose foot got tangled in the<br/>\nunderbrush. She will never get anywhere that way. And yet, the march<br/>\ngoes on.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you see how the marchers have broken up into little groups? Look at<br/>\nthat group up near the front. Now, there&#39;s a snappy out fit... â€“at<br/>\nleast they&#39;re in step with each other. Only they&#39;re not wearing their<br/>\nshoes. They&#39;re carrying them in their hands. Silly little band. They<br/>\nwon&#39;t get far before mom will have to stop again.... And that group<br/>\nover there.  They are holding hands.  Except the ones on the ends<br/>\nnoticed that they weren&#39;t holding another hand so the formed a circle.<br/>\n They will never get anywhere that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n*************<br/>\nWhenever I think about what unschooling is all about this is the image<br/>\nI get. (I adapted that from a piece of prose by Martin Bell in his<br/>\nbook &quot;The Way of the Wolf&quot;  It is a collection of Christian prose,<br/>\npoem and thoughts written eeek maybe 30 years ago?)  Anyway, the poem<br/>\nis called God&#39;s Rag-Tag Army and it truly is descriptive of our<br/>\nhousehold.  If we were an unschooling army we would be marching in<br/>\ncircles, playing with frogs, getting caught in the underbrush, yet we<br/>\nwould still continue our &quot;march&quot; forward, getting to where we want to<br/>\nget one step at a time, one adventure at a time, with no regards to<br/>\nhow an &quot;army&quot; should behave (unless, of course, we were wanting to<br/>\nknow how armies really behave :-D)<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle - waxing poetic today<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nMichelle Leifur Reid<br/>\nYOUR Pampered Chef Consultant<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nCheck out my homeschool cooking classes!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18111,"nextTopicId":18140}}
