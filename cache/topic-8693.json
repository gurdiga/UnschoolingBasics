I am new to hsing and unschooling, too, and know it is THE way for me and my family.  I want to first say that your children are SO fortunate to have a mother with the insight to remove them from a system that is not a good fit for their learning style.  As a former substitute teacher, I remember meeting so many young people like your 11 yr old.  They would be in resource classes but would be VERY gifted.  I did my best to convey to these students to hold onto their passions and pursue them fast and furiously after getting out of the system.  And the same game goes for you 9 yr old.  So many children are being lost by the way side because of the goals of the school systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your youngest, I have heard that children who have been in school need time to deschool and decompress.  To get back in touch with their natural learning desires.  My ds is 5 yrs old.  I started hsing with pretty much doing unschooling but with a bit of structure.  As I learned more about unschooling and began applying it to all areas of our lives, I too felt in limbo.  All my son did was sit around and watch TV.  I read in a book called The Unschooling Handbook that many children will kind of veg out for a while.  In a way it is a test to see if parents are really serious about unschooling.  Over time though, I have sat and listened to him talk.  He has a passion for wolves so much of our discussion and many of our activities revolve around wolves.  He loves it and learning is fun for the both of us.  I tell him often that I never really thought much of wolves, but because of all the reading and vids that we have watched about wolves, I am now in love with wolves myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I have done is to not focus on determining his interests as much as going about my day and doing things that interests me.  Usually, my children will follow along and jump in or eventually venture off and do their own thing.  As a result, discussions pop up about what I am doing or they will ask me to read a book (I have another ds who is 2.5 yrs old going on 25 yrs old!  LOL!) which will lead to us delving into a subject more indepthly.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther things I do with my children are things that I wanted to do as a child that I never did or did not do enough of.  When they see that I am excited, then they get excited, too.  I also change the environment around so that they can see what options are available if they so choose with respect to books, puzzles, etc.  We also play quite a few computer games together.  Carmen Sandiego is our favorite.  We solve the mysteries together and I am now a Carmen Sandiego addict.  I am often in shock about how much I get into my children&#39;s activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, something that I think calls for an adjustment in our thought processes is realizing that unschooling is really about living life.  It is not really a method of learning it is a lifestyle.  So, just doing normal things such as cooking, cleaning, running errands, speaking to the neighbors all count as unschooling things because my children get to see how things operate in the real world and won&#39;t be in shock once they get out of hs.  I know schooled kids get real world experience, too, but often times I think that my ds1 would miss out on certain things if he was in school such as grocery shopping.<br/>\n<br/>\nI offer all of this not as advice but as my experience and what is working for my family.  Best wishes with your wonderful children.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: kkraczek1969 <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, January 02, 2006 10:11 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] New unschooler- hi!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hello!

I&#39;d like to introduce myself, and ask a couple of questions. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am a new unschooler with 3 kids, 2 of which are at home. My oldest<br/>\n(boy) is 13 and has no desire to leave PS at this time. My 11 yo<br/>\ndaughter (who really inspired my journey to unschooling) attends PS in<br/>\nthe morning for band, computer class, and lunch before coming home,<br/>\nand I recently decided to pull my 9 yo daughter out of PS in favor of<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo give a brief (OK maybe not so brief ;) ) background, my 11 yo never<br/>\nfit into the PS system- she is a free spirit, an artist, and a lover<br/>\nof nature. She was diagnosed with ADD at a young age, and while<br/>\neveryone agreed that she is highly intelligent, she just wasn&#39;t<br/>\nkeeping up with the &quot;standards&quot;. (In other words, she just didn&#39;t pay<br/>\nattention and thus missed all of the information being taught.) So,<br/>\nafter watching her struggle for the last 2 years of elementary school,<br/>\nI decided that middle school would only make things worse, and started<br/>\nthinking of ways that I could reach her in a way that makes sense to<br/>\nher creative mind. She has so many interests that it is easy to<br/>\naccomodate her- she plays the flute at PS, takes art lessons, watches<br/>\nthe Food Network to learn all about her newest passion for cooking,<br/>\nand we have annual passes to SeaWorld so that she may visit her<br/>\nbeloved dolphins whenever she likes. :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t start with unschooling- I thought that I would just &quot;teach&quot;<br/>\nher more creatively, and that the one-on-one time would help with her<br/>\nattention issues. It wasn&#39;t until my youngest, a &quot;school&quot; type child,<br/>\n(please forgive me for stereotyping) started complaining about school<br/>\nthat I started thinking about how much I hated the whole idea of<br/>\n&quot;standards&quot;- PERIOD. Here in Florida we have the dreaded FCAT- and if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t pass it in 3rd grade, you don&#39;t pass 3rd grade. Now, my<br/>\nyoungest daughter is a detail oriented, perfectionistic,<br/>\nmuch-too-worried-about-everything kid, and guess what happened? When<br/>\nshe started having a little trouble in math, she went into hysterics.<br/>\nShe had herself so convinced that she wasn&#39;t good at math that she<br/>\nliterally quit trying. Of course, when you have FCATs in February,<br/>\nteachers can&#39;t stop for questions- they have to keep moving. So, the<br/>\nvicious cycle bagan. And ended. Once I started reading about<br/>\nunschooling, I knew what I had to do. I pulled her out just 2 months<br/>\nafter school began, and she was thrilled.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the questions. What do you do with a child who doesn&#39;t really<br/>\nshow an interest in anything at all? I was so happy to be able to<br/>\nprovide my other daughter with her creative outlets- but I just can&#39;t<br/>\nseem to get my youngest interested in anything. (OK, maybe shopping!<br/>\n;) ) We do play games and she had a brief interest in Egyptology, but<br/>\nother than that she doesn&#39;t have any obvious passions. I should say<br/>\nthat even my son has obvious interests, so I&#39;m really perplexed with<br/>\nthis. If anyone has any suggestions on how to draw out the more subtle<br/>\ninterests in their children, I&#39;d greatly appreciate any help that I<br/>\ncan get. I so want all of my kids to be happy, and I don&#39;t feel that<br/>\nenergy coming from her at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry for the rather long introduction- I really didn&#39;t intend for<br/>\nit to be that way!
