Now I will not waver at all and firmly stand my ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1994351176\">Thank you Kelly and Beth for your great responses. It<br/>\nreally helps to have that support, and you are so<br/>\nright. Now I will not waver at all and firmly stand my<br/>\nground in front of them. We had a long talk the other<br/>\nday (after quite a few run-ins) and I believe he is<br/>\nrealizing how serious I am about this. The anger he<br/>\nhas been having about my not giving in to &#39;his way&#39; is<br/>\nslowly turning to a way to understand. Sometimes now I<br/>\nwill see him trying to use my way, and even if it is<br/>\nsomewhat &#39;fake&#39;, it might become more natural after a<br/>\nwhile. So instead of saying &#39;when you don&#39;t stop<br/>\nthrowing the blocks at me xyz will happen, he said,<br/>\nwhy don&#39;t you try to build a castle with those...&#39; and<br/>\ngot the answer &#39; oh, yea, why not.&quot;. Yes, often it is<br/>\nthat easy. He is slowly getting that instead of<br/>\nrepeatedly saying &#39;no&#39; to a young child he is not<br/>\ngoing to hear it any better the fifth time, that a<br/>\nsimple redirection or explanation works wonders.<br/>\nHe did have a lousy relationship with his own father<br/>\nand is sure that his father is in some way responsible<br/>\nfor his cancer - and dealing with that has brought up<br/>\na lot of issues. He wants to be a good dad and has<br/>\npractically given his life to raising the two older<br/>\nones for 10 years by himself - the only way he knew<br/>\nhow. He did the best he could - all my ways are so new<br/>\nto him but since he loves and respects me he IS trying<br/>\nto understand. <br/>\nThere was a big conflict within myself in not trying<br/>\nto stress him due to his condition, it would have been<br/>\neasier for him would I let the children cry sometimes<br/>\nfor his sake - but I realize that would in the long<br/>\nrun not be healthy for anyone. <br/>\nThe diaper issue with the 22-month old is resolving<br/>\nitself. He is now dry at night and most during the day<br/>\nif I am fast enough to stick a bucket in front of him<br/>\n- when he needs to poop he just pats his bum and says<br/>\npopo (german for bum), very funny. Also in true<br/>\nunschooling fashion, I solved the pee-on-carpet issue<br/>\nby just taking the carpets out of the room -<br/>\nI love it how the children surprise me every day in<br/>\nthe things they want to learn - I have learned so much<br/>\nwith them already it is a great and wonderful journey.<br/>\nAs to the older kids it is more complicated. I<br/>\nactually do ask them to help sometimes - they<br/>\nsometimes say &#39;yes&#39;, but often forget, or they feel<br/>\nlike they &#39;have to&#39;. Today the 15 year old actually<br/>\nlet the 4 y.o. play with him and his friends for quite<br/>\nsome time. <br/>\nMy issue with the older ones is that dh still thinks<br/>\nthat they are only &#39;his&#39; concern, that at least with<br/>\nthem he can treat them the way he has always done<br/>\nwithout me interfering. I slowly try to get in there<br/>\nmore but I also realize I am not their &#39;real&#39; mom (<br/>\nwhom they see maybe once a year and has no idea that<br/>\none of her sons even left school...). I often feel<br/>\nlike I am - but still I feel like I can not do the<br/>\nthings or say the stuff I would were they not my<br/>\nstepchildren. Don&#39;t know how to deal with that issue<br/>\nbetter - it was my doing that dss left school but now<br/>\nthat he is out dh is still using &#39;school&#39; methods of<br/>\npunishment/reward etc. and I don&#39;t get consulted, just<br/>\nhear about it &#39;later&#39;.  How is this unschooling then<br/>\nsupposed to work? <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to being German and cleanliness - people have often<br/>\nsaid that I am the least german German they have ever<br/>\nmet. When I grew up our house was always stuffed full<br/>\nof books and art etc. and was cozy but did not always<br/>\nlook so clean. How shocked was I when I say our<br/>\nneighors houses where you could always eat off the<br/>\nfloor, the couches were covered in plastic when noone<br/>\nsat on them and the few books on the shelves were<br/>\nfake. So, I do like order, but just enought to enjoy<br/>\nlife.<br/>\n<br/>\nA short note on spelling - I never learned to spell in<br/>\nEnglish, I simply learned when I came to this country<br/>\nin my twenties and just had to do it, and reading lots<br/>\nof books in English. Now I am often  better at it than<br/>\ndh.

He thinks when he asks ds to do<br/>\n&gt;  something he should just do it without always<br/>\n&gt; asking<br/>\n&gt;  &#39;why&#39;, once I heard him say &#39;if you don&#39;t stop this<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt;  will send you to your room&#39;, or &#39;do you want to<br/>\n&gt; loos<br/>\n&gt;  that toy&#39; etc. - all things I abhore and would<br/>\n&gt; never<br/>\n&gt;  do to someone. So, trying to avoid confronting him<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt;  front of the children, I try to bring it up later -<br/>\n&gt;  which is not always possible of course since ds (4)<br/>\n&gt;  will usually then turn to me crying and I can not<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;  will not enforce these things. DH will then go on<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;  say that once again I make it difficult for him to<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt;  anything with ds, that how can I not sometimes let<br/>\n&gt; him<br/>\n&gt;  &#39;parent&#39; too -<br/>\n&gt;  his way that is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I wouldn&#39;t avoid confronting your husband in front<br/>\n&gt; of the children.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I think *he* needs to know you&#39;re serious. So do<br/>\n&gt; the kids: they need <br/>\n&gt; to know you *will* stand up for them in front of<br/>\n&gt; their father.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   If my husband were to say, &quot;Go to your room,&quot; I<br/>\n&gt; would say, &quot;No, of <br/>\n&gt; course you don&#39;t have to go to your room. A person&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; room should be his <br/>\n&gt; sanctuary, not a prison. Come here to me, and we&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; talk about it.&quot; &quot;Do <br/>\n&gt; you want to lose that toy&quot; would be met with: &quot;Of<br/>\n&gt; course he doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; want to lose that toy. It&#39;s his favorite. and he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; having so much fun <br/>\n&gt; with it right now. Why would you want to punish him<br/>\n&gt; like that? &quot; In <br/>\n&gt; front of my husband and the kids. They need an ally,<br/>\n&gt; not a &quot;united <br/>\n&gt; front&quot; that the conventional parenting books<br/>\n&gt; suggest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I think that, if he insists on being a difficult<br/>\n&gt; parent, then it would <br/>\n&gt; help him to realize *how* his children will view him<br/>\n&gt; later. Tell him!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Did he have this kind of relationship with his<br/>\n&gt; father? How&#39;s that <br/>\n&gt; relationship now? How does he feel about his<br/>\n&gt; relationship with his dad <br/>\n&gt; when he was little? Is that what he wants with his<br/>\n&gt; kids?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;d tell him that, if he wants to parent &quot;his&quot;<br/>\n&gt; way, then he needs to <br/>\n&gt; be able to deal with the consequences---angry wife,<br/>\n&gt; fearful children, <br/>\n&gt; unhappy family.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  That it should not matter so much as<br/>\n&gt;  he is usually not around that much anyways.

It would be<br/>\n&gt; better, expecially if <br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s not there often, to take a more &quot;backseat&quot; role<br/>\n&gt; instead of plowing <br/>\n&gt; ahead and expescting everyone to jump when he says<br/>\n&gt; so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I have tried to talk to him about how to say things<br/>\n&gt;  differently, that my children are very<br/>\n&gt; understanding<br/>\n&gt;  and that I NEVER have an issue of &#39;disobedience&#39;<br/>\n&gt;  simply because I treat them as equals who might<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt;  need a bit more help with some things. The older<br/>\n&gt; boys,<br/>\n&gt;  in dealing with the younger ones, often mimick what<br/>\n&gt;  dad does because he was the one who raised them<br/>\n&gt; &#39;his<br/>\n&gt;  way&#39;. (And boy did they fight sometimes). Although<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt;  recently say the 15 yo cringe when he would not let<br/>\n&gt;  the youngest go to me when he wanted to and told<br/>\n&gt; him<br/>\n&gt;  to not let him cry like that. My dh says he does<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt;  hear him cry and that he should just stay with him<br/>\n&gt; too<br/>\n&gt;  sometimes. He does, he loves his daddy, but<br/>\n&gt; sometime<br/>\n&gt;  he just wants me, or does not want to be held etc.<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;  that should be fine too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  -=-=--<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Children who are made to do what adults *make*<br/>\n&gt; them do are ripe <br/>\n&gt; targets for pedophiles and other predators.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   If he doesn&#39;t hear the baby cry, then maybe he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not the best person <br/>\n&gt; for the baby to be with. He&#39;ll need to be more in<br/>\n&gt; tune with the baby <br/>\n&gt; before I&#39;d leave them alone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  There are times though things are difficult.

No wonder you&#39;re a bit <br/>\nstressed.  The main thing I see in your post is that you are trying <br/>\nto do everything all by yourself.  It&#39;s like you&#39;re being a slave to <br/>\nyour children for the sake of unschooling.  Why do you not ask the <br/>\nkids, ALL of them, to help you with housework?  It&#39;s a necessary <br/>\npart of life.  It doesn&#39;t have to become a strict thing like in some <br/>\nfamilies with mandatory chores, rewards, etc.  I have never bought <br/>\ninto that even before I heard of radical unschooling.  My kids <br/>\nalways have the option of saying no when I ask them to help me, but <br/>\nthey very rarely do.  Sometimes, they are busy with something else <br/>\nbut will get to the request later.  I can&#39;t think of any housework <br/>\nthat has a do-right-now priority.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are 8, 9 and 14.  Even when they were toddlers, they <br/>\nloved helping out.  I&#39;ve always praised their efforts even when I <br/>\nknew I could have done a better job.  But a half-dusted living room <br/>\nis better than an all dusty living room.  Over time, their skills <br/>\nhave been improving.  They all know how to do laundry, load/unload <br/>\nthe dishwasher, wash down countertops and table, dust, vacuum.  The <br/>\nonly thing they don&#39;t really do is the bathroom.  My dd8 does enjoy <br/>\ncleaning out the sink but I&#39;m the only one who isn&#39;t bothered by <br/>\ncleaning the toilets.  *laugh* But housework can actually be fun <br/>\nwhen you turn on some music and everyone works together.  We always <br/>\nhave a blast!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you should have a discussion with your children about family <br/>\nsupport.  Don&#39;t worry so much about outside-the-family, focus first <br/>\non your children.  They may be a greater support than you know!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your 5 year old not reading, I don&#39;t think you should push <br/>\nhim.  You can work on the alphabet without making it a boring <br/>\nlesson.  I used to sing to my children all the time when they were <br/>\nlittle.  They sang the ABC song when they were toddlers.  They <br/>\nreally loved pointing out letters they knew.  I remember my son <br/>\nbeing 3 years old and being so excited to see a stop sign.  He&#39;d <br/>\nyell S-T-O-P means stop!!  My daughter Allison recognized the letter <br/>\nA early on because it was the first letter in her name.  She&#39;d point <br/>\nout all the &#39;A&#39;s&#39; she could whether it was at home in a book or <br/>\nwhile driving around seeing signs.  If he likes you reading aloud to <br/>\nhim, do that.  We have always read aloud and we love it!  I find it <br/>\nmore enjoyable than reading alone because we talk about the book <br/>\ntogether.  Those are actually good reading skills.  Comprehension is <br/>\nunderstanding what is happening in the story.  Vocabulary words are <br/>\ndefined as you come across something he doesn&#39;t know.  My kids <br/>\nusually stop me and say &#39;Mom, what does X mean?&#39;  I define it <br/>\nquickly, and then keep on reading.  I don&#39;t stop to turn it into a <br/>\nlesson, or write it down which makes it look like schoolwork.  They <br/>\nare hearing the word used in context and that&#39;s a super great way of <br/>\nlearning new words.  Also, we love to predict what might happen next <br/>\nin a story.  We just play &#39;what if&#39;.  What if the main character <br/>\ndoes this?  Or Oh no, what do you think is going to happen if he <br/>\ndoes that?  We just feels it makes reading aloud more fun to do <br/>\nthose types of things.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;ve written too much.  I&#39;m rambling.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":133390932,"authorName":"Mara","from":"Mara &lt;mamadeluz@...&gt;","profile":"mamadeluz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[unschoolingbasics] unschooling young children, family, support issues - long","postDate":"1150263009","msgId":14529,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNjE0MDUzMDA5Ljg5NDIzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzMjEwLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwOGUwMWM2OGVlYiRmYmEyYjE0MCQwMWZlYThjMEBzcXVpZD4="},"prevInTopic":14492,"nextInTopic":14530,"prevInTime":14528,"nextInTime":14530,"topicId":14492,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello everyone, after reading here (and a few books) for a while, and being excited about becoming a radical unschooler here are my questions I would love to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1930613272\">Hello everyone, <br/>\nafter reading here (and a few books) for a while, and<br/>\nbeing excited about becoming a &#39;radical unschooler&#39;<br/>\nhere are my questions I would love to have<br/>\ndiscussed/answered. I am still new to writing on<br/>\nlists, so please bear with me. And I certainly do not<br/>\nmind any and all opinions, I loved hearing and seeing<br/>\nRen and Kelly at the conference and have a so much<br/>\nrespect and gratitude for all of you who are running<br/>\nthis.<br/>\nSo, in the hopes of deepening my understanding, here<br/>\nit goes.<br/>\nI have 4 children I am hoping to unschool, almost 2,<br/>\nalmost 5, 15 (stepson who just left highschool) and 18<br/>\n(who went through the system and has a LOT of healing<br/>\nto do).<br/>\nI guess my biggest issue is that I am alone in all<br/>\nthis. We have no babysitters, family, friends etc. who<br/>\ncome and help out, either with just household things<br/>\nor watching one or the other for a bit ...<br/>\nMh dh is working a lot and quite busy, he says he is<br/>\nfine with me doing whatever that is I am doing as the<br/>\nkids seem to be quite happy and understanding.<br/>\nUnfortunately we have a few run-ins about his and my<br/>\nparenting style. He thinks when he asks ds to do<br/>\nsomething he should just do it without always asking<br/>\n&#39;why&#39;, once I heard him say &#39;if you don&#39;t stop this I<br/>\nwill send you to your room&#39;, or &#39;do you want to loos<br/>\nthat toy&#39; etc. - all things I abhore and would never<br/>\ndo to someone. So, trying to avoid confronting him in<br/>\nfront of the children, I try to bring it up later -<br/>\nwhich is not always possible of course since ds (4)<br/>\nwill usually then turn to me crying and I can not and<br/>\nwill not enforce these things. DH will then go on to<br/>\nsay that once again I make it difficult for him to do<br/>\nanything with ds, that how can I not sometimes let him<br/>\n&#39;parent&#39; too -<br/>\nhis way that is. That it should not matter so much as<br/>\nhe is usually not around that much anyways. And that I<br/>\nshould try to enforce when he says something. <br/>\nI have tried to talk to him about how to say things<br/>\ndifferently, that my children are very understanding<br/>\nand that I NEVER have an issue of &#39;disobedience&#39;<br/>\nsimply because I treat them as equals who might just<br/>\nneed a bit more help with some things. The older boys,<br/>\nin dealing with the younger ones, often mimick what<br/>\ndad does because he was the one who raised them &#39;his<br/>\nway&#39;. (And boy did they fight sometimes). Although I<br/>\nrecently say the 15 yo cringe when he would not let<br/>\nthe youngest go to me when he wanted to and told him<br/>\nto not let him cry like that. My dh says he does not<br/>\nhear him cry and that he should just stay with him too<br/>\nsometimes. He does, he loves his daddy, but sometime<br/>\nhe just wants me, or does not want to be held etc. and<br/>\nthat should be fine too. <br/>\nThere are times though  things are difficult. Like<br/>\nwhen we are at a restaurant or store and he starts<br/>\ntearing the place apart or running around through the<br/>\ntables. I understand a store is not the greatest place<br/>\nfor young ones and my biggest challenge to the<br/>\nunschooling ways. I have no choice but to take them<br/>\nwith me, and the older one is no problem, he would<br/>\nread in the cart or help me out looking for stuff<br/>\netc., but the youngest just wants to run and DO stuff.<br/>\nI have tried letting him help me put stuff in the<br/>\ncart, but he then wants to keep doing it (like<br/>\nthrowing ALL those lemons in there - or do they bounce<br/>\nwhen I throw them?) . He has a very exploratory<br/>\nspirit, and I feel bad having to say &#39;no&#39; (in other<br/>\nwords, as he HATES that word and I try not to ever use<br/>\nit) - but the same idea - you can not pull all these<br/>\nfrom the shelves, don&#39;t take the eggs out because they<br/>\nmight break, don&#39;t keep running away please etc. etc.<br/>\n Usually I feel totally exhausted and not so great<br/>\nafter the usual 2 hour ordeal. I do try to give them<br/>\nsnacks as well, which helps some, or let them carry<br/>\nsome things that can not break around with them for a<br/>\nwhile, but I still don&#39;t know how to do this more<br/>\ngraceously.<br/>\nThen there is bedtime - I have tried to let them<br/>\ndecide for themselves - now the usual bedtime for my<br/>\nalmost 5 is midnight - then he sleeps until 10 or<br/>\n10:30 am. The youngest usually falls asleep a bit<br/>\nearlier - then wakes up earlier - if I want<br/>\nuninterrupted time with the older kids or dh I have to<br/>\nwake up again which often I am too tired to do. When I<br/>\ndo I just have to tackle that huge mountain of clothes<br/>\nto be washed or folded, yet another dishwasher, clean<br/>\nthe playroom, living room etc. etc. It is just me who<br/>\ndoes everything, and even though I try to get a lot<br/>\ndone in the day I am just NEVER done and noone helps<br/>\nout. I don&#39;t mind doing it, it is just that sometimes<br/>\nI feel bad that I don&#39;t have as much one-on-one time<br/>\nwith my kids as so much time is spend cleaning up. I<br/>\nalways now when someone asks to do someting say to<br/>\nmyself &#39;why not&#39; and then do it -<br/>\nWhy not dump a mountain of flour on the kitchen floor<br/>\nand play with it (see how you can make eggs with a<br/>\nspoon?), Take out the paints, builds pirate ships out<br/>\nof all the furniture etc.,<br/>\nI do love all this and don&#39;t mind the trouble, it is<br/>\njust that sometimes then I don&#39;t have time for other<br/>\nthings or even really play with them, other then some<br/>\nminutes, sometimes just an hour a day of uninterrupted<br/>\nplaying with castles and knights.

Also when we go places, most kids are<br/>\nthere with their babysitters who spend most time on<br/>\ncellphones, and when he asked if maybe he could invite<br/>\none of those kids over to play, that never happens,<br/>\nbecause it is totally impossible to approach the<br/>\nparents or babysitter or I can just see it won&#39;t work<br/>\ntoo well. <br/>\nAny and all advice appreciated. And I do promise I try<br/>\nto keep things shorter next time. I usually don&#39;t even<br/>\nhave the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlright, one more thing. In unschooling the older<br/>\nones, I don&#39;t ask them to help around the house with<br/>\ncleaning, but I can barely keep up, let alone go any<br/>\nfurther than just dealing with the worst of messes.<br/>\nSometimes I feel like I am drowning in them - I do<br/>\nunderstand they have their own teenage things and<br/>\nissues to deal with, but sometimes it&#39;s just hard. <br/>\nSo, now onwards to the dishwasher and laundry...<br/>\nWith much appreciation,<br/>\nMara and the boys<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
