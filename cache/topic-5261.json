The sofa takes a beating but they are never still.  As a child my parents - also Christians - did not have a T.V. I feel maybe it didn&#39;t matter so much then  ( childrens T.V was a bit staid and they Anthem came on every night at a certain time, then the little dot lol)but nowadays the T.V is great for learning all sorts of things.

Thank you for editing that sarcastic remark, what ever it <br/>\nwas.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I would like to add to this discussion is that our <br/>\nfamily has only had a television for one year.  We as Christians <br/>\nused to really believe that we, as parents, needed to protect our <br/>\nkids from the outside world.  So, my husband and I got rid of our <br/>\ntelevision before our first son was even born.  We saw the serious <br/>\nerror in our thinking and purchased a television just under a year <br/>\nago.  When we first got it, I controlled what was watched all the <br/>\ntime.  I was also convinced that it would have an affect on their <br/>\nbehavior so I monitored that as well. Guess what?  It did not.  They <br/>\nwere still as energetic as before!  After a year of television, 3 <br/>\nmonths of that no control on what is watched at all, (due to <br/>\nunschooling) they are still as energetic, not comatose and still <br/>\nbouncing off the walls (o.k. the couches)  The only affect it has <br/>\nhad is positive.  They are learning new things all the time and <br/>\nquestioning much of what they hear.  I constantly hear,&quot;Mom, is that <br/>\ntrue?&quot; and I will have them research it on the net.  (My 5 and 6 <br/>\nyear olds are readers).  So, as for us, we will be keeping our <br/>\ntelevision and using it as another tool in their journey to be life <br/>\nlong learners.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thank you for letting me share in this discussion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaria  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ren Allen&quot; <br/>\n&lt;starsuncloud@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;OK, I think I misunderstood you Ren.
