Fortunately the kids and I<br/>\nhad gone on a road trip to San Francisco area, so we were out of the way,<br/>\nbut I had to help my husband determine what to take.  Ironically I am part<br/>\nof a survival training group and have been preparing for the past year so we<br/>\ncould be ready for emergencies, and then I wasn&#39;t there to help.  That was<br/>\nsomething to learn from, that both adults need to have the info at hand.  We<br/>\nare still living out of boxes, as we&#39;re in temporary housing, and all of my<br/>\nsurvival preparedness has taken a hit.  I did stack some vital boxes by the<br/>\ngarage door for easy retrieval (memory trunks, tax archives), but photo<br/>\nalbums and videos were in random boxes.  I have a packing inventory but it<br/>\nwas at home somewhere.  The funniest moment was as he was going room to room<br/>\nand I was identifying what to grab, and I told him to grab the box of<br/>\n&quot;Important Papers&quot; in the office.  Well, I was the one who packed and I was<br/>\nthe one who was going to unpack, and I wrote &quot;Important Papers&quot; in shorthand<br/>\nin the description corner of the box.  These most important papers are<br/>\nlabeled such that I am the only one who can read them, and they should have<br/>\nhad a bright label on them identifying them!<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was scary, he almost didn&#39;t make it home in time to get the boxes and our<br/>\ndog - a cop wouldn&#39;t let him through the neighborhood barricade, but he<br/>\nfound a back way in. <br/>\n <br/>\nDriving back home through the smoke was an experience.  I started smelling<br/>\nthe smoke around Coalinga, which is 320 miles north of San Diego.  We drove<br/>\ninto edge of the visible smoky haze about 40 miles north of Bakersfield, or<br/>\nabout 230 miles north of San Diego, and had headaches long before we hit LA.<br/>\nTime for a good air purifier.<br/>\n <br/>\nTonight we went out for supper and saw two firetrucks in the parking lot,<br/>\nthat were from Sacramento.  The crew was in the restaurant and got two<br/>\novations and many individual thanks (including ours).  Firefighters and fire<br/>\ndepartments definitely don&#39;t get enough financial support.  We&#39;re going to<br/>\nbe taking homemade meals to them for a long time.<br/>\n <br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. <br/>\nVersion: 7.5.488 / Virus Database: 269.15.5/1085 - Release Date: 10/22/2007<br/>\n10:35 AM<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: CA fires WAS updates: ramones, nursing and some q...","postDate":"1193328099","msgId":27332,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY5OTdCNzQ1LTQ3N0YtNEIwNy05NTYwLTgzNkRBNTRCMDIxQkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdlYTYzYWY1MDcxMDI0MDg1NGg1NGVjYzNkZmk1MWU3OTIxMjg0MjE4OGJmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGM5Ni4xYjM2YzExMi4zNDUwYzA0Y0Bhb2wuY29tPiA8N2VhNjNhZjUwNzEwMjQwODU0aDU0ZWNjM2RmaTUxZTc5MjEyODQyMTg4YmZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":27295,"nextInTopic":27391,"prevInTime":27331,"nextInTime":27333,"topicId":27287,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
