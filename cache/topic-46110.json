Alternately, can you bring more of &quot;home&quot; along with you - dvds and computers are good for that. Or can the eldest stay home alone an you only have two for an outting?

I don&#39;t think ANYTHING fits EVERYONE. My three year old DD is a social butterfly who is happiest surrounded by an audience of adoring fans (kids and adults) She is doing great in preschool because at home her siblings wanted to be left alone and mom was only one person, so even though I could sit and be entertained by her for hours, she craved more &quot;kid&quot; interaction. I would sometimes watch my friends daughter for 3 days in a row just so my DD would have someone to play with. I would happily go to park days or some other such event, but my older two HATE stuff like that, so how do you make everyone happy? I could get a sitter, but they REALLY hate having a sitter, plus I can&#39;t afford that right now (we just had a major financial setback, so sitters are not an option right now) This charter school offered a lot of things that my oldest was interested in, animation classes, cooking classes, and science classes. Originally I was just going to enroll her, but my son was jealous that both his sisters were going to school and he wasn&#39;t so I signed him up too. So far they are loving it, and so am I. If there comes a time that they truly don&#39;t want to go anymore, then we will do something else. I am still very flexible, I want them to be happy. Life at home was not happy, no matter how I tried to make it happy everyone was butting heads and arguing all the time. I think because of the kids age difference, a little separation a couple times a week has been a great thing.

I have a really hard time finding things to do that appeal to the kids, it always seems that they complain about everything I plan, even when it&#39;s something I really think they&#39;d be interested in such as going to the pool. They have fun once we get there, but I&#39;d have to force them to go and I thought that was going against the basic principle of unschooling. Either way, there has been way more joy and way less tension in our house since they started at this charter school. As I said, it&#39;s only two days a week, my son&#39;s class is a basic kindergarten, but with lot&#39;s of fun things to do, and my daughter has classes like science that she goes on and on about excitedly, and animation classes and a books and cooks class where you read a story and cook a meal. They LOVE  it and that was the point, if they had hated it after giving it a fair try (not just the general &quot;we don&#39;t want to leave the house, so we don&#39;t like it&quot;) I would have let them quit. I realize I&#39;m not a &quot;traditional&quot; unschooler, however I am still trying. I&#39;m trying to work around my ADHD and inability to plan things, this charter school makes up where I lack, and I think that&#39;s a good thing.

For  <br/>\n&gt; example, if they learn best riffing off other people with similar  <br/>\n&gt; ideas and a family can&#39;t get them connected and some other program  <br/>\n&gt; can, it&#39;s better for the kids to connect than to put some ideal of  <br/>\n&gt; unschooling ahead of the kids.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s going to scare some people. Some people will worry if they&#39;ve  <br/>\n&gt; got what it takes to unschool. And it won&#39;t help anyone if people  <br/>\n&gt; sooth those worries with platitudes of &quot;You&#39;ll do fine!&quot; when they  <br/>\n&gt; have no knowledge of the situation to back that up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Worry&#39;s not good though! But questioning it definitely is.

I know there are ups and downs in deschooling - in life! But there&#39;s not much point striving for unschooling if most of what its doing is stressing out the family. It&#39;s less important to &quot;get there&quot; in terms of being &quot;all the way&quot; unschoolers and more important to grow together as a family, wherever that may lead y&#39;all. (And in a way, that&#39;s moving closer to the spirit of unschooling anyway ;))<br/>\n<br/>\nIn deschooling, there&#39;s often a phase where kids are doing fine - are much, much happier than before even if they seem to be floundering a little - but parents are in a tizzy, overwhelmed with What Ifs and Oh My Goshes and if they can&#39;t move past those fears quickly it becomes veeeerrrrry tempting to grab at something solid and familiar - like school or a curriculum, because those feel safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else to do in that kind of situation is hard to say - it depends soooooo much on the kids, really, so that&#39;s the &quot;short answer&quot;: focus on connecting with the kids and meeting their needs. Of course with older kids, those needs become less obvious, too. It may help to do more strewing - offer new and different things rather than going solely on established interests - or it may help to get out of the house more for a while, or it may help to spend more time &quot;nesting&quot; - reading together or watching tv or playing video games, even if its not the most exciting sort of life for a time, just to focus on connecting. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":414490706,"authorName":"sarahrandom78","from":"&quot;sarahrandom78&quot; &lt;bdb1978@...&gt;","profile":"sarahrandom78","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling and schoool","postDate":"1297621884","msgId":46139,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlqOTgxcyt1NGZyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlqNjd1MStzZXVqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46129,"nextInTopic":46140,"prevInTime":46138,"nextInTime":46140,"topicId":46110,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for your support.

I was really struggling with unschooling, and this seems like a good compromise. It was partly my daughters idea, because her friend also goes to this school. They offer video editing and animation classes, which is what she is really into, and now she has someone who can teach her how to do those things, as I&#39;m not all that talented in that area. She had been asking for awhile to take such classes and now she has the opportunity. Also, my son has the opportunity this way to meet some kids closer to his age, since before he didn&#39;t want to go anywhere, but would complain endlessly about being bored. I think that &quot;I&quot; am not cut out for unschooling, not because of the relationship I want to have with my kids, but because of my own lack of being able to &quot;help&quot; them find interesting things to do. They were spending most days being bored, and I could never seem to find a way to help them with that. Over the summer, we will try again, but for now, this is working great for us, and really that&#39;s all I want. They all seem to get along so much better now that they have a few hours apart in the day. They get home and they play so much better together, and their interaction with me has improved as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  sarah taylor &lt;bdb1978@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unschooling wasn&#39;t going great for us <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It was pretty clear from your previous posts that you were struggling with it.

For  <br/>\nexample, if they learn best riffing off other people with similar  <br/>\nideas and a family can&#39;t get them connected and some other program  <br/>\ncan, it&#39;s better for the kids to connect than to put some ideal of  <br/>\nunschooling ahead of the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s going to scare some people. Some people will worry if they&#39;ve  <br/>\ngot what it takes to unschool. And it won&#39;t help anyone if people  <br/>\nsooth those worries with platitudes of &quot;You&#39;ll do fine!&quot; when they  <br/>\nhave no knowledge of the situation to back that up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorry&#39;s not good though! But questioning it definitely is. If there  <br/>\nare parts that aren&#39;t working, do bring it here and unschoolers can  <br/>\nlook at it with fresh eyes and give you suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; DD age 11 would sit in<br/>\n&gt; her room for hours on the computer and then complain that she didn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;do&quot;<br/>\n&gt; anything all day, complain that she was bored, but no matter what I  <br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; suggest, that didn&#39;t sound like fun, and she couldn&#39;t seem to think up<br/>\n&gt; anything on her own either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With some kids, doing is better than suggesting.

DD age 11 would sit in<br/>\n&gt; her room for hours on the computer and then complain that she didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot;<br/>\n&gt; anything all day, complain that she was bored, but no matter what I would<br/>\n&gt; suggest, that didn&#39;t sound like fun, and she couldn&#39;t seem to think up<br/>\n&gt; anything on her own either. My son age 5, would play the Wii all day, and<br/>\n&gt; meltdown anytime someone else wanted the TV (we have multiple TV&#39;s but the<br/>\n&gt; Wii is on the bigscreen, and even though we offered to put movies on the<br/>\n&gt; other TV or the Wii on the other TV, everyone would just end up arguing over<br/>\n&gt; the big TV) UGH!!! I finally decided that something had to change and found<br/>\n&gt; this charter school. It was gone into with the attitude that if they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; like it and want to quit, they absolutely can, but so far so good. My<br/>\n&gt; youngest also just started at a preschool where they use the Reggio Emilia<br/>\n&gt; approach. I decided to start her there because she is so social and she<br/>\n&gt; loves it. She may be the one of my children who really likes school and<br/>\n&gt; wants to go to a regular school and that will have to be OK with me. I loved<br/>\n&gt; school when I was in school so maybe she just takes after me.
