I think the title is unfortunate in a way<br/>\nbecause it may alienate those who (a) don&#39;t like labeling their children,<br/>\nand (b) don&#39;t think it applies to them because their child is not explosive.<br/>\nI found the book to be a real gem in regard to helping the parent shift<br/>\nparadigms from &quot;parent&#39;s way&quot; to collaborative problem solving.  It really<br/>\nbenefits everyone, not just parents of explosive children, as it&#39;s valuable<br/>\nfor all of us to develop the habit of solving problems instead of powering<br/>\nthrough control struggles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second statement brings to ming &quot;When Anger Hurts your Kids.&quot;  Another<br/>\nunfortunate title that may be off-putting to some.  It has a wonderful<br/>\nexercise to identify and chart your triggers - and a common trigger is that<br/>\n&quot;The kids are trying to drive me crazy/doing this to irritate me.&quot;  It has<br/>\ngreatly helped me see that many of the things I get angry about are *my*<br/>\ntriggers and *my* issues and not those of my kids.  It&#39;s wonderful to,<br/>\ninstead of reacting with anger, remember that &quot;this is one of my triggers.&quot;<br/>\nJust having that thought pop into my head begins to diffuse my irritation<br/>\nand turn me toward unraveling that issue instead of blaming my kids.  It<br/>\nalso really helped me prepare for *visiting grandparents* who may not share<br/>\nour unschooling values.  I was apprehensive about what I viewed as my dad&#39;s<br/>\nincreasing tendency toward getting irritated easily - then I shifted my<br/>\nthinking to try to figure out some of his triggers ahead the visit.  Boy,<br/>\nthat went a LONG way in helping us have a peaceful visit.  I realized when<br/>\nhe gets worried about safety he reacts with anger, which is very common.  I<br/>\nmade sure if we were playing or doing activities that would make him<br/>\nanxious, that I stayed nearby so he didn&#39;t feel that he needed to be &quot;on<br/>\nalert.&quot;  It took a load off of each of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust sharing two good books,<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. <br/>\nVersion: 7.5.503 / Virus Database: 269.16.13/1167 - Release Date: 12/3/2007<br/>\n12:20 PM</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":307938888,"authorName":"Amanda Horein","from":"&quot;Amanda Horein&quot; &lt;horein@...&gt;","profile":"michmdmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Question about putting principles instead of rules in play","postDate":"1196088808","msgId":28029,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIzMzJkZjUwMDcxMTI2MDY1M2c1ZTA3NjFmOXJkMzY5NTlhZGQ3YmRmNTAxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28016,"nextInTopic":28195,"prevInTime":28028,"nextInTime":28030,"topicId":27963,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-=-=-=-=- I feel really dumb, but I didn t get this until just now...

For us, we&#39;ve got a third hand couch and loveseat in the<br/>\nliving room, large sturdy bookshelves and entertainment center along the<br/>\nwalls (nothing small or light enough to tip easily) and that&#39;s it - lots<br/>\nof space in the middle of the room (no end tables or coffee table or<br/>\nanything like that - we have some small stackable plastic tables that<br/>\ncan be moved out of the way as needed - most breakables are up high<br/>\nenough to be safe OR put away and only come out on limited occasions).<br/>\nThe way we figure it, another 10 years and DS will be grown (he&#39;s 9 now)<br/>\nand not needing to bounce on the couch. Then, we&#39;ll get the nice<br/>\nfurniture and all. Just when the nice new furniture is starting to be<br/>\n&quot;old&quot; in 5 or 10 years from then (15-20 years from now), the grandkids<br/>\nwill come along and the furniture will be in just the right state of<br/>\n&quot;oldness&quot; for them to relax on and bounce. One of DS&#39;s favorite things<br/>\nis flipping up and over the loveseat when it&#39;s away from the walls<br/>\n(perpendicular and out in the room when we&#39;ve got the Christmas tree up<br/>\n- after a while, though, he wants the open space back so we move it back<br/>\nout of the way once the tree is away). Nephew (he&#39;s 4 now) wanted to do<br/>\nit too - but he was too small to manage it. So, we got DS&#39; small step<br/>\nstool and it was just right. We made sure to keep an eye on things for<br/>\nsafety (DS has become really good at adjusting his behaviors with<br/>\nsmaller people around - interesting since he&#39;s an only, no &#39;built in&#39;<br/>\nsmaller people to practice with). And, this past weekend, we were at a<br/>\nfamily holiday gathering in a VERY small place with MANY people (18<br/>\npeople in a space the size of about 20x10 - and that includes the<br/>\nkitchenette area with table and chairs, an additional 6 ft long table, a<br/>\nrecliner, a sofa, a TV/entertainment center, and a pair of bookshelves -<br/>\nit was VERY crowded). 16 adults, a 9 yr old, and a 4 yr old. When the<br/>\nkids started getting antsy, I sat myself on the middle of the sofa and<br/>\nnephew was given the go ahead to launch himself across the room (all 3<br/>\nfeet or so of floorspace) and leap onto me - I&#39;d catch him, set him<br/>\ndown, and he&#39;d go again. In between times, DS wanted to do the same but<br/>\nwe decided that since his mass was bigger than nephew&#39;s, the energy<br/>\nresulting from it would likely push the couch around, so instead he&#39;d<br/>\nstand in front of me directly and jump up into the air and then onto me<br/>\n(vertical instead of horizontal motion). After a couple dozen jumps,<br/>\nnephew and DS were both playing quite happily and folks started saying<br/>\n&quot;Ok enough - leave her alone&quot; to which I said &quot;Nope, I&#39;m fine&quot; and we<br/>\ncontinued. Eventually, both boys decided to just stop and snuggle up on<br/>\neither side of me. The alternative was to rein them in to NO physical<br/>\nactivity and spend the day rule-ing and regulating and punishing them<br/>\nfor simply being energetic boys in a confined space. By giving them a<br/>\nsafe way to burn energy, we ended up with a much more comfortable time<br/>\nfor all (BTW what we were doing is something I&#39;ve played with DS since<br/>\nhe was a toddler so I&#39;m quite practiced in absorbing/deflecting the<br/>\nenergy to keep myself and the jumper safe - no bumped nose, noggins,<br/>\nknees, etc)<br/>\n <br/>\nWe don&#39;t want bouncing on our bed - a lovely select comfort extra big<br/>\nking - BUT we didn&#39;t make a &quot;rule&quot; about it. We discussed with DS<br/>\nvarious aspects from OUR perspective (since we have a cape style house,<br/>\nthe ceiling angles to meet the wall over the bed - too short a distance<br/>\nbetween head and hard popcorn textured surface; nightstands create<br/>\ncorner issues; lamps on said nightstands are breakable; etc) and<br/>\nlistened to HIS perspective on what he wanted to get out of bouncing on<br/>\nthe bed - and worked together to find ways to meet his needs AND our<br/>\nneeds. The thing with rules is that it creates a win/lose situation<br/>\nwhile what we&#39;re working toward is win/win - as many needs as possible<br/>\nget met one way or another. For us, that meant getting a mini<br/>\ntrampoline, an inflatable punching bag, and developing games that we<br/>\n*could* safely play on/around the bed area that involve vigorous<br/>\nactivity *safely* (for instance, I sit on the edge of the bed and DS<br/>\nruns across the room, safely cleared floor space, and tries to push me<br/>\nover - sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn&#39;t, but either way, we get<br/>\nsome vigorous play going).<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

They *don&#39;t* want to hurt someone. But when humans have a need<br/>\nand can&#39;t figure out more principled ways of meeting it, humans often<br/>\nstart tossing out the principles.

It&#39;s like<br/>\nremote control parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t a substitute for being there. A great deal of<br/>\nconventional parenting is reactive: responding to problems. Mindful<br/>\nparenting is about being aware of our kids and their needs and<br/>\nresponding before things escalate. (We can&#39;t be perfect but we can be<br/>\nbetter!)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Wow.  That whole explanation was absolutely mind blowing for me.  I had<br/>\nnever thought of rules as remote controlled parenting.

You live them or not live them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrinciples aren&#39;t something you impose on someone. They&#39;re the parts  <br/>\nof a philosophy that help you decide if an action is in keeping with  <br/>\nyour own personal philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re having a hard time figuring this out because you&#39;re trying to  <br/>\nchange your kids to make them behave differently. Use your own  <br/>\nprinciples to help them navigate the world. Help them get what they  <br/>\nwant in ways that don&#39;t hurt someone. It *is* what they&#39;re trying to  <br/>\ndo. They *don&#39;t* want to hurt someone. But when humans have a need  <br/>\nand can&#39;t figure out more principled ways of meeting it, humans often  <br/>\nstart tossing out the principles. Even the most peaceful mom is  <br/>\nlikely to kill someone to protect her kids if she&#39;s backed into a  <br/>\ncorner and can&#39;t figure another way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp you kids not feel backed into corner. Give them escape route.  <br/>\nGive them the confidence that you will help them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the biggest problems with rules is they&#39;re used as  <br/>\nsubstitutes for being there. It&#39;s like the parents are handing the  <br/>\nchild a bit of themselves and telling the child to obey it. It&#39;s like  <br/>\nremote control parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t a substitute for being there. A great deal of  <br/>\nconventional parenting is reactive: responding to problems. Mindful  <br/>\nparenting is about being aware of our kids and their needs and  <br/>\nresponding before things escalate. (We can&#39;t be perfect but we can be  <br/>\nbetter!)<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you give us some examples of problems?
