My little son ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-100358519\">~~~limit the amount of time my kids watch TV and playcomputer games. *gasp* <br/>\n<br/>\nI had never even heard the word unschooling when my son was two.  My little son<br/>\nshowed an amazing amount of interest in airplanes. (Probably helped that we have<br/>\nRC planes everywhere and our own runway.) So my spouse bought an very expensive<br/>\nflight simulator for the computer for this child.  At two, he learned how to fly planes and<br/>\nis rather good at it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~~~mine will do nothing but play RuneScape all day if it&#39;s allowed<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I heard of Runescape via this group, I introduced it to my family.  I now pay for<br/>\nfour members. (I&#39;m the biggest user. ; ) )  One of the interesting things that came out <br/>\nof this game, was the kids asking (and us researching all the facts)  If things were <br/>\nreally made, caught, etc, as designed into the game.  We ended up learning a lot <br/>\nabout mining and glassblowing and such.  (Much I knew, but I never play the expert.<br/>\nWe always look things up so they get the current information, lol, I&#39;m old.)  I don&#39;t<br/>\nset limits and have found that my kids bounce to all types of activities.  They have<br/>\nno tv, computer, sports, eating, etc, addictions.  (I&#39;ll accept that my kids are special *grin* j/k)<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess I was RU before I heard the word!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBe a better Globetrotter.
