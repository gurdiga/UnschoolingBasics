Maybe not right for you or the <br/>\nright time of life for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do think there are times it is useful for adults to get together <br/>\nto talk without distraction and sometimes people don&#39;t seem to use good <br/>\nsense about how disruptive their own kids are going to be. I bet <br/>\nthey&#39;ve had problems with that, and that&#39;s why they set up the teens <br/>\nwatching over the younger kids and why they don&#39;t want the children in <br/>\nthe adult talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeaving kids in order to talk about being at home? I think it makes <br/>\nsome sense to do that. For a couple of years, I gave talks on a <br/>\nscheduled basis to those who are interested in getting started <br/>\nhomeschooling - when people had their children with them it very very <br/>\ndefinitely reduced the amount they learned from the talks and also <br/>\nreduced the amount other people at the talks could learn. I did it <br/>\nanyway - because the talks were the hour before our regularly-scheduled <br/>\npark day and so it made sense for them to have their children with them <br/>\n- but I can most definitely say that it was distracting and made a <br/>\nsignificant difference in how in-depth we were able to get. I did these <br/>\ntalks at a park, so the kids could play on the playground right next to <br/>\nwhere the talk was going on, and often that was fine, the kids were <br/>\nbusy and happy. But other times the kids were very much in evidence and <br/>\nvery distracting. It was worth it - the timing was good, the atmosphere <br/>\ninformal and encouraging to parents of young kids. But, definitely I <br/>\ncan see how the opportunity to talk without the distractions of kids <br/>\nwould be beneficial, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nLife is Learning; Learning is Life<br/>\n&lt;www.unschooling.info&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136674689,"authorName":"KJoy!","from":"&quot;KJoy!&quot; &lt;mmm@...&gt;","profile":"kellyjomurphy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] does this sound normal?","postDate":"1096080934","msgId":3333,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzZDMwMWM0YTJhYiQyMTU2MDc5MCRjYjU1MmFhMkBNVVNFUGxheWdyb3VuZD4="},"prevInTopic":3332,"nextInTopic":3334,"prevInTime":3332,"nextInTime":3334,"topicId":3323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you so much Robyn!

From the sound of it, kids were not welcome.  So I called and said &quot;of course, it&#39;s ok to bring the children-right?&quot;  And the lady in charge said &quot;well maybe we could find a babysitter if someone needed it but really it&#39;s better if you can come without them.&quot;  And when I explained that I really thought I&#39;d like the children&#39;s input on the trips and stuff (it was a field trip planning type meeting) and that I&#39;d like them to come along with me if at all possible, she again offered to find a teen to come and watch them for me so that I could participate.  I was baffled and I didn&#39;t go.<br/>\n <br/>\nNext week is another party and I think thankfully something came up because suddenly I feel I have so very little in common with school-at-home homeschoolers that I don&#39;t know how it will go.  So we won&#39;t go next week but next month, they&#39;re going to the observatory which I know my son is interested in so my plan is to participate sort of from afar until I figure it all out.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo to answer your question-I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; but I&#39;ve seen it happen.  It&#39;s mind blowing to me really.  lol<br/>\n <br/>\nJonni-Ann<br/>\n***Those who hear not the music think the dancers mad***<br/>\n<br/>\nSharon Thomas &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meplusfive@...\">meplusfive@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nI got onto a list for our local homeschool group thinking it would give us<br/>\nan opportunity to meet other kids with like interests.<br/>\nI got an email last night saying the monthly meeting would be tues. at 6:00<br/>\nThere would be babysitters and we needed to let her know so she could know<br/>\nhow many teens to get.<br/>\nThere is going to be a man coming that is a teacher at our community<br/>\ncollege and he is sharing that there is an opportunity for the teens in<br/>\npublic and homeschool to participate.

It sounds<br/>\nlike a school-at-home activity and support group. They are intending to be<br/>\ndiscussing &quot;business&quot;, and that the kids might be distracting or<br/>\ndisinterested in the talking heads. They are assuming that mothers would<br/>\nlike a bit of a break from their kids. Maybe the teen sitters are really<br/>\ncool and your younger ones would have a really good time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you all like any of the field trips then you could go on them. Is<br/>\nattending this monthly meeting mandatory if you want to engage in other<br/>\nactivities or park days with the group?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do they propose to &quot;prevent&quot; your child from coming to you or calling<br/>\nyou if they need you? If this idea is actually the philosophy behind the<br/>\ngroup it may not be a good fit for someone who is parenting mindfully. Have<br/>\nyou talked to any of the other members, than the host, kind of checking the<br/>\nreferences of the sitters?<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
