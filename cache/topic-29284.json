I was two months<br/>\npregnant with our oldest.) DH said he hadn&#39;t really thought being a <br/>\nparent<br/>\nwas something you had to study for. You just did what your own parents <br/>\ndid.<br/>\nWe discussed our own childhoods and agreed we wanted something better <br/>\nfor<br/>\nour kids. So, despite many comments from our parents and others we<br/>\nco-slept, breastfed (well, I did anyway), wore our babies, had a home <br/>\nwater<br/>\nbirth, etc.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBen and I were L-A-T-E. I so wish we had done this from the get-go, but <br/>\nwe made huge strides as older parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so envious of those of you who figured/are figuring this out early.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe hear a lot about just going with your heart/instincts/whatever. But, <br/>\nbasically, we were just doing what had been modeled for us---what our <br/>\nparents had done. Ben and I had very similar childhoods---very <br/>\nSouthern, very traditional, very controlled. It wasn&#39;t second nature <br/>\n*at all*  to us to think about the kids *now*---all our thoughts were <br/>\nabout our kids in 20 years to come. What kind of adults would they be, <br/>\nnot what kind of children they are *now*.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a huge revelation for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading these lists and the old message board gave us so much to think <br/>\nabout. Stopping and *thinking* before we said or did anything. Actually <br/>\nTRYING to be a better parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad is/was a pretty great dad, but I don&#39;t know that he actively <br/>\nstrived to be a better parent every day. I know my mother didn&#39;t. Ben&#39;s <br/>\neither. They&#39;ve both said, &quot;I may have made a few mistakes, but *you* <br/>\nturned out just fine.&quot; It was all about the finished product. Never <br/>\nmind the pain and insecurity and anger and doubt. We turned out just <br/>\nfine. No self-reflection, no self-examination. Just do what *your* <br/>\nparents did, and the kids will turn out fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure it&#39;s seen as a slap in their faces for us to reject the way we <br/>\nwere reared, but frankly that&#39;s not *my* problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want my boys to have even fewer things to work through than I did. <br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s the case already. We talk a lot about parenting <br/>\nWITH the boys! I doubt that&#39;s discussed---or even allowed to be <br/>\ndiscussed---in many families.
