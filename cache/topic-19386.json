Just going to live my life, our lives, in <br/>\nways that make us happy and try and ignore people&#39;s &#39;reviews&#39;. One <br/>\nnice thing about having been married 15 yrs (and since I was 18, [I <br/>\njust turned 34 last month) is that it helps you put time in <br/>\nperspective... It feels like just yesterday I GOT MARRIED and by <br/>\nthose calculations, our kids will also be grown in a blink of an eye <br/>\nand I&#39;ll be missing them, not only the sweet cuddles we have as we <br/>\nall wake up, but them being in our home as before I know it, they&#39;ll <br/>\nbe off living thier own lives.

I wrote <br/>\nher an e-mail and attached several co-sleeping articles that someone <br/>\nhad sent me the link to that talked about the benefits of <br/>\ncosleeping. I am not sure she read them, but now that I&#39;ve sent them <br/>\nto her, I don&#39;t plan to ever let her bring it up with me again. I <br/>\nthought it was great, the person who commented that &#39;if she&#39;s <br/>\nworried about your sex life, you could give her the details and <br/>\nthat&#39;d shut her up pretty quick&#39;... Laughed out loud at that one! I <br/>\nthink, even if we didn&#39;t co-sleep with our kids, or especially if we <br/>\ndidn&#39;t, we&#39;d still have to be &#39;creative&#39; about our sex life at this <br/>\nstage of our lives (having small kids). If we didn&#39;t cosleep, I <br/>\nsuspect that bedtime would be such a stressful time that after we <br/>\nfinally &#39;fought the kids&#39; into bed, we&#39;d likely be so drained that <br/>\nwe&#39;d be like &#39;forget it, I am tired!&quot; LOL! B/t/w my husband also <br/>\nsleeps on the couch or in the &#39;kids room&#39; sometimes... He&#39;s been an <br/>\ninsomniac his whole life (hmmmm... Wonder if he&#39;d have had that <br/>\nproblem if his parents had EVER let him have a bit of comfort at <br/>\nnight, but I digress...) and so he sort of sleeps where he CAN <br/>\nsleep... But he&#39;s been that way our whole marriage (15yrs) and our <br/>\nkids are only 3.5 and ~2, so I don&#39;t see how they or cosleeping <br/>\ncould be &#39;blamed&#39; for that...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat irritates me, and has been on my mind lately, is that many of <br/>\nthe naysayers I&#39;ve read about are (I suspect and I know my MIL is) <br/>\nfrom the &#39;Babyboomer&#39; Generation. (I am 34, a Gen-Xr myself) That <br/>\nwas a generation that SUPPOSEDLY prided themselves on &#39;thinking <br/>\noutside the box&#39; and &#39;questioning convention&#39; etc etc etc... Well... <br/>\nI suppose that must&#39;ve only applied to questioning the convention&#39;s <br/>\nthat THEY wanted to... Since my MIL and many of her generation seem <br/>\nto come unglued at the thought of long-term nursing, co-sleeping, <br/>\nhomeschooling (or God Forbid! Unschooling!!!). Yet the same people <br/>\nseem to have no problem with the practice of dropping a 6wk old <br/>\nchild off in Daycare (or Paycare or whatever you want to call it) <br/>\nand I am sure that the same people wouldn&#39;t be as shocked if your <br/>\nson had gone and gotten some girl pregnant at 12 than they were at <br/>\nhim watching his Mum bring his sister in the world... Ok... Who&#39;s on <br/>\na rant now? Me! Guilty! I will probably get cross words from some <br/>\npeople for such broad generalizations, but I was just musing about <br/>\nthese things and as I sat down to type a response, out they came... <br/>\n<br/>\nSmiles,<br/>\n Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rshoulla&quot; &lt;rshoulla@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our two youngest are 2 and 1 and the littlest co-sleeps every <br/>\n </span></blockquote>night, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the 2yo only sometimes either with me or our 13yo ds.

She asked about  <br/>\nco sleeping and then told us her friends read the experts books on parenting.  <br/>\nShe said her 13 mo slept with them (I can&#39;t recall if she said full time? I <br/>\nwas  still trying to get air as I was nervous AND she had a mic pack in her hand <br/>\nso I  was wondering about that).<br/>\nAnyway.. She said she was uneasy about sharing that with her friends as  they <br/>\nmay find issue with it. <br/>\nAt 37 I think I have been in her shoes however.. now 4 children later  it <br/>\nsounded so odd that she would feel such outside pressure and that her  friendship <br/>\nwas based on agreement. <br/>\nI was shocked when I said it but it did fall out of my face.  I  told her <br/>\nthat I learned over the years that people don&#39;t need to know everything  and if <br/>\nyou know they are going to take issue don&#39;t bother telling them. <br/>\nShe seemed a bit more not so odd and her face relaxed. <br/>\n <br/>\nI think it&#39;s hard for some to relate to emotionally attached parenting(if  <br/>\nthose are the right words). Or maybe they have regrets about their own  <br/>\nparenting? Thing is you may never know unless they share it.

Well... My Mother In Law this <br/>\n&gt; morning on the phone when I was discussing a totally different <br/>\n&gt; problem in my life with her, said she had some advice for me that <br/>\n&gt; she knew wasn&#39;t her business but that she just felt compelled to <br/>\n&gt; talk to me about anyway. Then she launched into how she thought <br/>\n&gt; I &quot;just need to get the kids out of our bed&quot; and how &quot;it&#39;s not <br/>\n </span></blockquote>good <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for the kids nor for your marriage&quot; and how &quot;kids should see that <br/>\n&gt; their parents are a separate unit from themselves and that they <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t need to see themselves as part of the marrital unit&quot; (or <br/>\n&gt; something like that?) and how &quot;sleeping with them is more for YOU <br/>\n&gt; than it is for THEM&quot; and how they&#39;re never going to grow into self <br/>\n&gt; reliant individuals if I keep them in our bed etc etc etc, yatta <br/>\n&gt; yatta yatta... As usual, my blood pressure went right up and I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>just <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; kept stammering &quot;I&#39;ll give it some thought&quot; etc etc. I never know <br/>\n&gt; what to say to her when she goes off like that.

Maybe I should just talking with her?

Advice please!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I understand your frustrations.  I have been in similar situations <br/>\nin the past.  I have changed my behavior which has helped.  I no <br/>\nlonger talk/discuss matters so close to my heart.  I remind myself <br/>\nto keep the conversation bases on &quot;light touch&quot; topics.  I too have <br/>\na mother in law that is more like a mom.  I have learned through <br/>\nmany conversations that she was not going to give me the 100% <br/>\napproval that I wanted.  So, gradually I learned what was safe to <br/>\ndiscuss with her and what wasn&#39;t.  Now, our relationship has grown <br/>\ntremendously.  She supports me and she doesn&#39;t know the details.  <br/>\nShe knows general things and if she askes me for specifics, I rarely <br/>\ngive them.  It was  difficult at first and sometimes I slip and <br/>\ndiscuss something I regret(something I feel very strongly about). I <br/>\nam only sharing my situation, but I am happier. Now, I discuss my <br/>\nholistic parenting/unschooling with people that are safe.  I rarely <br/>\nhave heated discussions and that I am grateful for!  Good luck to <br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn light,<br/>\nKimberly Payne</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":222220143,"authorName":"Ginger Sabo","from":"Ginger Sabo &lt;kaikade@...&gt;","profile":"kaikade","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Cosleeping; Response to naysayers?
