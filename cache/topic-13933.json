In the synopses I&#39;ve looked at online, there&#39;s <br/>\nnothing that says the evaluation has to show grade level work - just <br/>\nprogress from year to year. The tests are only at the end of 3rd, <br/>\n5th, 8th and 10th grade - so if they are requesting testing more <br/>\noften, you can respectfully decline and choose an alternate option - <br/>\na written eval by a HI certified teacher (I&#39;d bet there are some <br/>\nhomeschoolers who are also certified and do evals for people) or a <br/>\nwritten eval by the parent which demonstrates progress (includes <br/>\nassigments to be submitted but you can write the assignment after <br/>\nthe fact to match whatever it was he actually did!)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out Sandra Dodd&#39;s website on unschooling for info on how to <br/>\ntake tests without stressing testing. Also, there are several sites <br/>\n(probably linked off Sandra&#39;s) that show samples of &quot;curriculum&quot; <br/>\nplans that parents have submitted in places like NY and PA (which <br/>\nare really law-bound as far as homeschooling).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is doable. Since you&#39;re not overseas, you are under the local <br/>\nlaws - if you were overseas, I think you&#39;d come under DoDDs regs <br/>\nrather than that country&#39;s laws since you&#39;re on base. <br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":248268539,"authorName":"Elissa Jill Cleaveland","from":"&quot;Elissa Jill Cleaveland&quot; &lt;MystikMomma@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New :)","postDate":"1149275823","msgId":13938,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzgwMWM2ODY3OSQyMWQ1Mjc2MCQwMWZlYThjMEBzcXVpZD4=","referencesHeader":"PGU1cHRsMityYTI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13933,"nextInTopic":13940,"prevInTime":13937,"nextInTime":13939,"topicId":13933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"And it s all things that by state law they have a right to request from me.

I&#39;ve <br/>\nfound so many of the posts sooo helpful- thanks to everyone here who <br/>\nsocompletely explain their positions and help open up great <br/>\ndiscussions and learning!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 3 children- 2 girls, 15 and 13, and boy, 8. I&#39;m married <br/>\nluckily to a very open-minded man.  While he admits that he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nalways understand or &quot;get it&quot; when I try new things or think the way <br/>\nI do, he still goes along with me until he figures it out- and <br/>\nusually agrees with me. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo, my kids have been in public school, and we&#39;ve dabbled in <br/>\nhomeschooling although traditional curriculum-based schooling didn&#39;t <br/>\nlast long for us.  This past school year we pulled our son from PS <br/>\ndue to the crummy way the system and local administration treated <br/>\nhim and his disabilities (he&#39;s severely dyslexic, dysgraphic, has <br/>\nADHD, SID and is HS on top of all that.) We thought to traditionally <br/>\nhomeschool but he doesn&#39;t need or want that structure and silly <br/>\nbusywork, and I definitely didn&#39;t want to deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls have asked to stay in PS school, but I&#39;ve made it clear to <br/>\nthem on many occasion that they do not have to choose that route. My <br/>\nson expresses no wish to go back to PS, which we&#39;ve assured him will <br/>\nnot happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth dh and I went to public school from K to 12.  He was parented <br/>\nvery strictly, yet very disfunctually.  My parents were &quot;almost&quot; <br/>\nunschoolers except for that damned PS crap. ;)  Seriously, they did <br/>\npretty good- no curfews, no rules for the sake of rules, I made <br/>\nchoices for myself based on my needs and wants and not on what THEY <br/>\nthought I needed or wanted.  I could have used more privacy and <br/>\ntrust in that realm- I chalk that up to my brother being a drug <br/>\naddict and that old saying &quot;once burnt, twice shy&quot;.  But dang, I&#39;m <br/>\nSTILL ticked at him for putting me in that position and them for <br/>\nthinking I&#39;d be like him and not trusting me to know better or learn <br/>\nfrom his mistake. Had it not been for that, I&#39;d think they did <br/>\npretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo, I told myself as a teen that &quot;when I grew up&quot;, I wouldnt <br/>\ndistrust my kids based on somebody else&#39;s behavior, and I&#39;d give <br/>\nthem the privacy they deserved.  They wouldn&#39;t feel stressed over <br/>\nhaving to hide letters or notes from friends or a boyfriend, and <br/>\nthey would know I respected their intelligence and choices.  So, <br/>\nthat&#39;s how we&#39;ve raised the kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am allowing them their choice to attend PS although they know I <br/>\npersonally wouldn&#39;t choose that route for myself.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t &quot;homeschool&quot; ds with curriculums and books. I don&#39;t push them <br/>\ninto anything I think they should like, and I don&#39;t force them to <br/>\ngive up things they do like just because I find no interest in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have hang-ups, too- I am realizing just how many, or how <br/>\nmuch better I could do things by reading all of your posts and <br/>\nadvice to other newbies. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest fear in letting go completely is based in the educational <br/>\nrealm.  I know my son can learn as much- and MORE- without <br/>\ntextbooks. He has proven that fact.  But, we&#39;re a military family; <br/>\nwe live on a military base with a school that he originally attended <br/>\nright down the road, and they know we&#39;ve pulled him <br/>\nto &quot;homeschool&quot;.  They send letters expecting him to take the Fed <br/>\ntests and the state assessments, they expect progress reports at the <br/>\nend of the year about what he learned, examples of work he&#39;s <br/>\ncompleted or projects he&#39;s created.  They expect a written list of <br/>\ncurriculum and topics he will learn about this coming school year.  <br/>\nAnd it&#39;s all things that by state law they have a right to request <br/>\nfrom me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe year-end report is easy. I can gloss over the curriculum issue <br/>\nby talking about what he learned and if necessary showing some <br/>\nprojects he does as a normal daily activity and just calling <br/>\nit &quot;school projects&#39;.  But, what do I do for next year? What do I <br/>\nsay for what we plan to teach to meet 3rd grade standards?  And, <br/>\nescpecially, what about these stupid tests?! I doubt he&#39;d do well on <br/>\nthem if he was in PS either because of his learning differences, but <br/>\nthere I could push the issue in an IEP. What do I do since he is at <br/>\nhome? Have any of you run into any of these problems before?  How <br/>\ndid you handle it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much for being here, understaning, and giving out advice <br/>\nto all of us trying to be better parents and partners to our kids. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTina Layne<br/>\nHawaii (dh-Jim, 15-Jaclyn, 13-Megan, 8-Ryan)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13895,"nextTopicId":13697}}
