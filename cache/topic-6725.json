In Feb. we decided to go to the animal <br/>\nshelter and look for a cat... we came home with 2 10-week old kittens <br/>\nlol... The animal shelter is a dangerous place!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I don&#39;t go! &lt;grin&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe just got back from the kitties.   He fosters for several area <br/>\nshelters who do the catch, fix, adopt thing too.  We go once a week <br/>\n(this is our 3rd week) and it&#39;s amazing to see how much they&#39;ve <br/>\nchanged!  The shyest ones, who wouldn&#39;t even come near us last week, <br/>\nwere ALL OVER us today!  And I hope it contributes to my daughter&#39;s <br/>\nawareness of the &quot;joy of volunteering&quot; especially when it&#39;s something <br/>\nyou love.  And the guy who does this is always talking about their <br/>\ndevelopment, showing us the different things at different ages, other <br/>\ncat facts, stuff we didn&#39;t know, it&#39;s fun!  I had to be sure I could <br/>\ndo this WITHOUT wanting to bring any home (dh and I discussed this <br/>\nand agreed no more animals right now, we just lost our 11 yo <br/>\ngreyhound in April), and I&#39;m doing OK!  I LOVE black cats, and OF <br/>\nCOURSE, there are MANY black ones, short hair, long hair, babies, <br/>\nmoms, older kitties, and OF COURSE we sat for a while with the <br/>\nyoungest group who as of this week are old enough to be out and about <br/>\nand interact with others, and the only BLACK kitten came over to me, <br/>\nplayed with my hands (I also spent time with the others! LOL) and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to leave my lap (I told him, &quot;Don&#39;t you DARE pull at my <br/>\nhearstrings!&quot;).   I like to think we&#39;re helping them become great <br/>\npets for other families.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad you were able to give your &quot;free&quot; basement cat a few years.  <br/>\nOur&#39;s is an indoor cat too (we have coyotes).   I also find that my <br/>\ndd is very animated (not sure how to describe it, more alive, it&#39;s a <br/>\ngood thing!) after we visit.<br/>\nJann (off on a tangent too - OOOOOH a MATH word!)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1224177,"authorName":"Saulithyia@aol.com","from":"Saulithyia@...","profile":"saulithyia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"[unschoolingbasics] Cats was re:Hi everyone, I am new and curious about Unschool","postDate":"1127337017","msgId":6725,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZmLjFjNjdhMTVmLjMwNjMyNjM5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6729,"prevInTime":6724,"nextInTime":6726,"topicId":6725,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/21/2005 1:36:40 PM Eastern Daylight Time, jlh44music@yahoo.com writes: He wants  them to get used to lots of different people, not just","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1667650877\">In a message dated 9/21/2005 1:36:40 PM Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jlh44music@...\">jlh44music@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants  them to <br/>\nget used to lots of different people, not just him, so when  they&#39;re <br/>\nready to be adopted they&#39;re used to being with others (many of the  <br/>\nmoms were wild/abandoned/ferral, sometimes the moms are pretty  <br/>\nfriendly (if they had lived with people before) but some of the <br/>\nothers  are pretty unfriendly because they&#39;re scared and not used to  <br/>\nhumans.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to say that that is awesome... I&#39;ve had cats all my life and  <br/>\nLOVE them. Our &quot;baby&quot; since DH and I were together was a feral kitten. The mom  <br/>\nwas stray and nested in my grandparent&#39;s barn to have her babies. We were <br/>\nable  to catch our Kitty and a lady that did a &quot;catch, fix, release or adopt&quot; <br/>\nprogram.  Unfortunately, the momma cat was too wild for anything and had to be <br/>\neuthanized.  But, 4 kittens, we have one, another was adpoted and 2 returned to <br/>\nmy  grandparents. One still lives there and one was too curious about the road <br/>\n :(<br/>\nOur Kitty has domesticated nicely. She&#39;s now 7 years old, has been a  <br/>\nstrictly indoor cat since she was 4 months. We moved to our house 3 1/2 yrs ago  and <br/>\nthe former owner left his cat here, in the basement, in a mess. The poor  <br/>\nthing... so, we joked about how we bought an expensive cat and it came with a  <br/>\nhouse. She passed away last year right before Christmas. We miss her dearly. In  <br/>\nFeb. we decided to go to the animal shelter and look for a cat... we came home <br/>\n with 2 10-week old kittens lol... The animal shelter is a dangerous place!  <br/>\n;-)<br/>\n <br/>\nOk, I went off on a tangent there!
