You all get up when you <br/>\nchoose, eat something somewhere along the way, maybe play in the <br/>\nyard or go swimming or go fishing or catch tadpoles. You maybe watch <br/>\na movie, read some books (for fun, not &#39;grade level&#39; or &#39;required <br/>\nreading&#39;), doodle, turn over rocks and watch the worms. Somewhere in <br/>\nthere more food occurs as needed. Evening rolls around and you look <br/>\nfor bats, watch the fireflies, maybe make a little fire in your <br/>\nbackyard firepit (if you&#39;ve got one), toast marshmallows (or not). <br/>\nEventually, you all fall asleep. Not once during the day did anyone <br/>\ndo anything or think about anything they &quot;should&quot; be doing because <br/>\nthey are in a certain grade or need to do a certain subject. Life <br/>\njust flowed along.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is where you need to be right now to start - getting all the <br/>\nschool system out of your system. Take a vacation. &quot;Typical&quot; rule of <br/>\nthumb is one month of &quot;vacation&quot; (aka de-schooling, detoxing) for <br/>\nevery year of school for every person in the house (you too Mom - <br/>\nand you were in the system longest). Explore things that are of <br/>\ninterest, not of requirement. If your state *requires* some sort of <br/>\ndocumentation, make notes at the end of the day about what you did - <br/>\nwalked, baked, played, etc. Sort it all out later.<br/>\n<br/>\nExpect that it won&#39;t look a whole lot like school learning is <br/>\nhappening - odds are your kids won&#39;t pull down the textbooks and <br/>\nworksheets and beg you to give them quizzes. They will watch TV, <br/>\nthey will play, they may even read a bunch (if that&#39;s what they like <br/>\nand they now have free rein over what and when and how much). <br/>\nThey&#39;ll be like a field that needs to lay fallow for a time so that <br/>\nit can regroup itself so it can produce strong healthy crops again. <br/>\nThey might not even ask questions just yet for fear it&#39;ll produce <br/>\na &quot;lesson&quot; on something. So, what to do? Take time, Be with them, do <br/>\nyour own things as well (pick up that forgotten knitting or take up <br/>\na new hobby).

Here is what <br/>\nour week has been like so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday - we cleaned the house, picked up projects that they were no <br/>\nlonger interested in building/making.  I set a book on the side <br/>\ncabinet in the kitchen opened to magnets.  I also set some magnets <br/>\nwith other objects by the book.  I made a checklist &quot;What is <br/>\nmagnetic?&quot;.  I left it in the morning.  My 7 year old reads very <br/>\nwell and enjoyed the checklist (she did it after dinner).  My 4 year <br/>\nold doesn&#39;t read but loved to experiment with the magnets and making <br/>\nthings moved.  Over a late dinner we discussed the checklist. <br/>\n(Sometimes they do just ignore the book and project)<br/>\n<br/>\nMonday - Daddy was in from work and he had a discussion over <br/>\nbreakfast with the girls about magnetism.  We talked about <br/>\nnorth/south poles, Aurora Borealis, etc.  Then we visited <br/>\ngrandparents and waited for their cousins to get out of school so <br/>\nthey could fish/play at the grandparents house.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuesday - Hubby and oldest daughter went with grandpa to the hunting <br/>\nstore to get supplies for the upcoming season.  Hubby always likes <br/>\nto tell the girls what kinds of dead things are hanging on the walls <br/>\nat the stores.  Youngest daughter and I (who don&#39;t like hunting) had <br/>\nbreakfast and talked about our neighborhood.  Then we all met at <br/>\ngrandma&#39;s house for lunch and dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nWednesday - we did some window shopping, the girls picked out a new <br/>\ntoy.  We worked outside in the yard and played badminton. We had <br/>\ndinner at a local Chinese place and discussed how people speak <br/>\ndifferent languages (since we live in Cajun country many people here <br/>\nspeak French - as well as Spanish and Chinese).  Then we camped out <br/>\nin the living room and watched a movie together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThursday - we are doing errands/paying bills today and visiting the <br/>\nlibrary.  My oldest daughter is interested in music/dance/costumes <br/>\nand wants to get some books.  My youngest just likes to walk to the <br/>\nlibrary.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started as the &quot;school at home&quot; crowd.  But the only thing we <br/>\nfound we enjoyed were certain books.  My oldest sometimes likes <br/>\nworksheets if she wants to do them like a game - like, &quot;Mom - time <br/>\nme to see how fast I can do this page&quot;  But that isn&#39;t very often.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne book we do like from our past curriculum is &quot;Story of the <br/>\nWorld&quot; - it tells history like a story.  I buy the activity book as <br/>\nwell.  It has lots of maps and coloring sheets and activity ideas.  <br/>\nLike when we read about the Vikings the girls took an old box and <br/>\nmade a ship out of it.  Then they screamed &quot;We&#39;re going a-viking&quot; as <br/>\nthey pretended to be Vikings for a few hours - complete with made up <br/>\ncostumes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also unschool (LOL) and many days while they are playing quite <br/>\ncontently I can spend hours researching my family history or <br/>\nlearning new stuff to make our house eco-friendly.  I also pursue my <br/>\npassions of soap making, bread baking and sewing.

My husband is a guitar builder for Gibson and has advice for a left handed player:<br/>\n <br/>\n I have several left-handed friends who learned to play right handed.  They say it&#39;s so much easier to play that way, because their dominant hand is fretting the strings, and that&#39;s where the extra strength and dexterity come in handy. There will always be a larger variety of right handed guitars than left.  Left handed guitars are more common now than a few years ago, but most companies still charge a little more for them.  If she ever gets in a situation where people are passing the guitar around the campfire, it will be easier to borrow someone elses since they will most likely be right handed.  Hope this is helpful.  It is also easier to sell a right handed guitar for upgrading or loss of interest.  <br/>\n <br/>\n HTH,<br/>\n Amanda<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nHow low will we go?
