Catherine is getting ready <br/>\nto head to camp this weekend, and is very excited about that.  It is <br/>\nher third year.  She&#39;ll be gone a month this time!  The first year was <br/>\none week, the second year two weeks, and now we&#39;re really getting <br/>\nserious with half the summer!  She loves it, and it&#39;s such a nice break <br/>\nfor both of us who spend so much time together during the rest of the <br/>\nyear.  Expands her perspective I think.  She gets enough of mine!  <br/>\nShe&#39;ll miss her karate time though.  Her entire social life revolves <br/>\naround those classes, and they&#39;ve been great for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaley is in Pre-K and loving it.  We do a lot with her at home as well. <br/>\n  Haley loves music and singing, as does Catherine.  Neither has shown <br/>\nany interest in competitive sports, and both love to draw and color.  <br/>\nSo I pretty much go where they take me, and I&#39;ve been really enjoying <br/>\nthe journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for me, well, I am writing a book about all these adventures in <br/>\nlearning...it may never make the bestseller list, but it may at least <br/>\nhelp us remember the great times and the not-so-great times we&#39;ve had <br/>\nin both homeschooling and unschooling for future years.  I am a little <br/>\nshy on memory, so I like to get a lot down on paper.  I also like to <br/>\nencourage my girls to write.  Catherine is pretty loathe to it!<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from that, enjoying gardening and some beautiful weather - warm, <br/>\ndry, sunny days that aren&#39;t too hot.  Getting psyched and ready for an <br/>\nannual trek out to Nantucket island.

Keegan found<br/>\nthem at the bottom of a drawer full of projects and craft supplies and<br/>\ndecided to check them out. I had presidents everywhere!  I showed him money<br/>\nand how some of the presidents were also on money and coins.  He played with<br/>\nthe presidents all day without me interfering except to answer the question;<br/>\nWho is this mom? which I answered with no other explanation, because he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t ask for more info.  I used to worry about reading skills or lack<br/>\ntheir of, but now I see that the natural progression will be like this<br/>\npresident thing.
