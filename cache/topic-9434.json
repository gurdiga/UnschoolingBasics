I have been wondering the same thing in the last few weeks.  When we go to the store, I never fuss about him looking at guns.  I buy shooters but I have read that toy guns and violent games promote violence in children.  But of course with my new unschooling philosophy, I have been wondering if my saying no to toy guns is really okay with me.  I do like that you said that your son has branched off with learning through weapons.  Honestly, I want my children to know how to handle weapons so that they if they do find a real weapon, then they would know how to handle it safely.  Now that I think about it, it is not the weapon that is bad, it is how it is used that makes all the difference.
