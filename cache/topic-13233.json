I was talking to a co-worker about it when we were trying to <br/>\nfigure out the how much question and she said what she had done with <br/>\nher DD (who was graduating college at the time) was that from 5 to 9 <br/>\nshe got $5 per week, from 10-about 14 I think (if I remember <br/>\ncorrectly) it was $10 per week, at 15 it went to $15 per week and <br/>\nstayed there - because at 15 or 16 you can get a part time job, <br/>\nbabysit, etc and earn any additional you might want. It&#39;s mostly <br/>\nbased on the idea that up to a certain age, the immediate wants are <br/>\ntypically (not always) less expensive - a soda, a small toy, etc. By <br/>\nage 10 or 11, kids may want to go to a movie with friends WITHOUT <br/>\nparents holding their hand so their funds need to be adequate for <br/>\nthem to do something like that fairly readily (within a week or two <br/>\nof allowance). And teens are more likely to want to go out to get a <br/>\nsmall meal or snack with friends and that sort of thing which is <br/>\nmore expensive still potentially.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it is, DS gets &quot;paid&quot; when I get paid twice a month which means <br/>\n$10 each &quot;pay day&quot;.

It&#39;s not tied to anything, just extra cash<br/>\nto save or spend on whatever we want. Sometimes the kids want my opinion on<br/>\ntheir purchase and I&#39;ll tell them what I think, sometimes they don&#39;t. I make<br/>\nsuggestions and try to help them to be savvy consumers. Sometimes I&#39;ll bring<br/>\nup a point that they may not have thought of, &quot;That looks kind of flimsy, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it will last long at all.&quot; That kind of thing but they are free<br/>\nto purchase it no matter what I think. If they make a bad purchase I will<br/>\nhelp them to return it, just like I do when I make a bad purchase. I don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand why we would not extend a child the help they need to return or<br/>\nexchange an item just as we would do for ourselves. Why do you call it<br/>\nbailing them out? How about just helping them? What would you call it if it<br/>\nwas your husband asking you to return a bad purchase for him? Would you<br/>\nstill consider it &quot;bailing out?&quot; I can&#39;t count the amount of bad purchases<br/>\nI&#39;ve made in my life. I&#39;m always grateful when I can recoup my losses and<br/>\nlearn from it. I think kids having spending money is important for learning<br/>\nabout the real world and how it works. Children can learn a lot from bad<br/>\npurchases, maybe more than from good purchases. Make it a learning moment.<br/>\nHelp shed light on the situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 5/16/06, Lorah &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lorahv@...\">lorahv@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s all about slowly turning financial control over to your kids,<br/>\n&gt; starting small with a clothing allowance, and letting them spend as<br/>\n&gt; they wish, but not bailing them out when they mess up.
