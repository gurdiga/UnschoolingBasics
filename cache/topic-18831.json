Childhood is NOT a <br/>\ndress rehearsal: what he does now WILL effect his future---but not in <br/>\nthe way you and he think it will. The the idea that learning is good <br/>\nand available and valuable and that is it what humans DO is more <br/>\nimportant than the facts and figures you&#39;d be taught in school. That we <br/>\nare *always* learning and can stop and change and try something new, <br/>\nthat learning is fun and exciting and inspirational, that learning <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t LOOK like school subjects---these are what he should be <br/>\nlearning now---he&#39;ll GET the math and grammar and geography through <br/>\nLIVING a rich, full life.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n~Sandy  (I do not judge success on going to college, this is basically<br/>\na &quot;just in case&quot; type of question.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools THRIVE on &quot;just in case&quot;.
