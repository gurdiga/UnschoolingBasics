I live in Michigan with my dh of 13 years, Tracy. We <br/>\nhave three great kids who have never been to school, Connor(8) Kenyon<br/>\n(5) and Molly(almost 2). I learned about homeschooling when Connor <br/>\nwas 2. I started reading everything I could on the various <br/>\nhomeschooling philosophies, and we have been mostly eclectic/relaxed <br/>\nin our life/learning styles - with brief periods of structure as I <br/>\nlearn to let go of my &quot;Teacher Mom&quot; tendencies. Luckily Connor is <br/>\nthe only one who has ever had to deal with Teacher Mom, and since I <br/>\nbanished her a few months ago we&#39;re both recovering very nicely :o)<br/>\nand calling ourselves &quot;unschoolers&quot; for the first time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately we&#39;ve been enjoying warm weather and watching the &quot;greening&quot; <br/>\nof our property. We&#39;ve adopted a big fat toad and set him up in a <br/>\nterrarium in the living room. The boys enjoy finding bugs for him to <br/>\neat. The boys are also hooked on playing Spyro on their GameBoys and <br/>\nZoombinis on our PC. Connor got a great word search book for his <br/>\nbirthday a few weeks ago so he&#39;s been having great fun with that <br/>\nalso. Kenyon is a digger-we have holes all over our yard. Muddy days <br/>\nare especially fun around here. And Molly is very busy learning lots <br/>\nof new words and also honing her motor skills as she circumvents all <br/>\nof our &quot;toddler-proofing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to talking and learning with everyone on the list!<br/>\n~Sarah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9,"nextTopicId":44}}
