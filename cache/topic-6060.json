There was a very<br/>\ninteresting documentary on recently about the making of that movie.  I was<br/>\nwatching to catch a glimpse of some friends of ours who were background<br/>\nactors on the film.  I didn&#39;t know I was interested in skateboarding either<br/>\nbut it was fascinating seeing these creative vibrant people doing their<br/>\nthing.  There is a big group in So Cal called &quot;Skateboarding Moms&quot; or<br/>\nsomething.  The head lady is a homeschool mom and they get together to do<br/>\nexpos and skateboard clinics.  Too cool.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: Re: Cartoons/games<br/>\n<br/>\n***I am still looking for a bio of Tony Hawke. :-)***<br/>\n<br/>\nI watched a skateboarding thing last week on one of the ESPN channels.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t remember what it was but some skateboarding competition.  Danny Way<br/>\nwas skating on a fractured ankle, said he couldn&#39;t feel his foot,  but<br/>\nwas *flying* off these very tall ramps and blowing my tiny mind.  There<br/>\nwere other famous skateboarding guys doing amazing tricks too.  Dylan<br/>\ncame by and said &quot;I didn&#39;t know you liked skateboarding&quot; and I said &quot;I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know either!&quot;&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMight have to go to the library...<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6049,"nextTopicId":6066}}
