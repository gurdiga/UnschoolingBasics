We just got it today (yay!!). I play lots of their games with them. I play Halo, even though it takes me a while to adjust to first person shoot &#39;em ups, they are fairly tolerant and very amused by my clumsiness. Although if they want to play a challenging game they will ask if it&#39;s alright that I not play. It always is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done that all the way through. Simon used to sit on my lap while playing Tonka Construction with the tools table that strapped on to the keyboard and Blues Clues and Putt Putt and all the other games we had when he was small. And when Linnaea grew to an age where she wanted to play on the computer she would sit on my lap and play, in a very similar way. Although she didn&#39;t like me to be involved as much. She just wanted me to sit there and be with her while she played. She was probably less interested, played at the computer less.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother bought Simon a game boy advance when he was 4. We got a hold of a pokemon game for it and he would sit cuddle up with me while I read every line of text and he excitedly worked to catch &#39;em all. He didn&#39;t, but it was so wonderful to play with him that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe games and time around the games becomes, in moments, like when we are out driving in the car. Two nights ago I sat with Linnaea for a couple of hours while she played Golden Compass and I ran and researched the cheats she needed and came back and hung out more and we chatted a bit and talked about weird things in the game and what was like the movie and what wasn&#39;t and other things. Sometimes I could help her, but more often I was just there because she wanted my company and that was really nice. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlay with him. Or sit with him while he plays. Don&#39;t wait for the time in the car, play with him. Oh, and sometimes, when I know Linnaea or Simon needs food right then, I will feed them while they play. It usually ends with laughter. And they eat. And when they get to a point where they can stop or pause the game, they&#39;ll feed themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else can I do to support him?

But there doesn&#39;t seem to be the same self-regulation.****<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there can be a level of self-regulation but it may be harder with gaming because there is so much to do in most games.  So many games are very complex and do take a lot of time to, if ever, complete.   Also,  as your son gets older he&#39;ll learn to handle his frustration.  I remember times when my son, who is now soon to be 16, would be so frustrated.  He&#39;d be trying to get to the next level of a game or trying to find something hidden to progress and it just wasn&#39;t working.  Many times he&#39;d need to just walk away from it, take a break and then when he&#39;d go back to it it would work.  Sometimes I felt very helpless, but also sometimes I would feel really proud of myself that I could stay calm and help him.  Now he and his sister, who is 14, will often calm me with my frustrations &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you found guides to follow to help him with these games that are frustrating?  There are online guides for most games or guides for purchase.  Are there other games that he could play that would be more playable?  We would sometimes get a game and right away see that it was too frustrating; but then later, maybe months or a year or so, it was a go.  Maybe you can get some different games?<br/>\n<br/>\nI also tend to take on the feelings of others so I know what you&#39;re saying.  It is hard not to feel them but if I stayed calm (took a deep breath)  and let him vent about his frustrations,  things would go so much smoother.  We could then look at the problem and try and fix it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t look to limit or control his playing,  I would try and find ways to make his playing smoother.  <br/>\n<br/>\n ***Should I try to get us <br/>\n<br/>\nout more so that he sees more variety in his day; will that help or <br/>\n<br/>\nhinder his self-regulation?

I see how <br/>\nmuch fun he has.  Also see his accomplishments - his working hard <br/>\ntoward accomplishing something, not giving up when it gets tough. <br/>\nThere is *so much* value in what he&#39;s doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I still worry. I do my best to keep it to myself and never <br/>\ncomplain about the games or make them out to be &quot;bad&quot;. But the amount <br/>\nof time he plays and the effects I see are what bothers me and I what <br/>\nI need support with. If I were seeing the same effects with his <br/>\nreading medical textbooks all day, I&#39;d still worry. It&#39;s not the <br/>\nvideo games that bother me; it&#39;s everything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a WAHM I was working online ALL DAY (12-15 hrs a day!). <br/>\nAnd when I stopped working, I still felt the draw towards being <br/>\nonline all day. It was such a habit for me that I had little idea <br/>\nwhat to do with myself so I resorted back to being online. It took me <br/>\nclose to a year to manage that and much of it was with the <br/>\nhelp/support of my DH and DS. Now I wonder if I&#39;m not doing enough <br/>\n(or not doing the right things) to help/support him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been over two years since we started unschooling. We had a TV <br/>\noff and on thru our lives but got cable as a &quot;resource&quot; shortly after <br/>\nwe started unschooling. We had video games and computer prior but <br/>\nnothing was really limited because he was never much interested. He <br/>\nwent to school and played outside with neighborhood kids after. After <br/>\nan initial adjustment period of TV without limits, we all seem to <br/>\nregulate well. Somedays we watch a lot of it, some days not at all. <br/>\nDS likes to watch the disney shows before he goes to bed; that&#39;s <br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I haven&#39;t seen the same adjustments with computer/video games. <br/>\nPerhaps lack of commercials or the end of a show has something to do <br/>\nwith it? But there doesn&#39;t seem to be the same self-regulation. He <br/>\ngets on within moments of being awake and only takes a break from one <br/>\nto do the other (video games to computer and vice versa). He doesn&#39;t <br/>\neat regularly while playing, even when food is offered or placed near <br/>\nhim. He does usually take bathrooms breaks now (an improvement from <br/>\nthe past). He gets very stressed out during some games (rightfully so <br/>\nsince some of them are very challenging!) and gets frustrated and <br/>\nangry. Many times that frustration carries over into other things and <br/>\naffects the whole family or sets the tone/mood for the rest of his <br/>\nday.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen him get bored with it a few times or says he wnats to take <br/>\na break and get off only to get back on within 1-2 minutes, as if <br/>\nit&#39;s the easiest option or the only thing he can think of to do. I <br/>\ntry to engage him during those times with different things but he&#39;s <br/>\nrarely interested, saying they&#39;re boring. He doesn&#39;t usually seem to <br/>\nenjoy himself with the video games because of the frustration <br/>\ninvolved that leads to such stress for him. Computer is usually much <br/>\ndifferent, and less stressful.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually the only thing that I can do is find a way for him to take a <br/>\nbreak - make a meal that needs to be eaten at the table, go on an <br/>\nerrand, go on a visit to someone&#39;s house, etc; something to get him <br/>\nup and moving and away from it. In the moment he doesn&#39;t seem too <br/>\nkeen on the idea of quitting but within minutes he seems more <br/>\nrelaxed. Our best times are car rides - we have such good times while <br/>\ndriving! Especially if we&#39;re in the truck where he can sit up front. <br/>\nWe always have the best conversations! :D I&#39;d really like to find  <br/>\nway to always have the same great time that we do while we&#39;re out <br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else can I do to support him? If I try to discuss it with him, <br/>\nwhat kind of things should I say or not say? Should I try to get us <br/>\nout more so that he sees more variety in his day; will that help or <br/>\nhinder his self-regulation? I&#39;m trying not to let his frustrations <br/>\nfrustrate me but that&#39;s difficult for me. I tend to take on other <br/>\nppl&#39;s moods, especially his. I know it doesn&#39;t help when we&#39;re both <br/>\nfrustrated and trying to communicate; what can I do at those times? <br/>\n<br/>\nI really really need some practical &quot;try this&quot; ideas on how to <br/>\nsupport him or help him manage it all. <br/>\n<br/>\nReally looking forward to help, <br/>\nTara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38638,"nextTopicId":38761}}
