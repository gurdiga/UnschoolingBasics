Television.  We have a 5 and 7 year old...there <br/>\nare things that are not okay for them to watch.  Movies too.  Things <br/>\nthey don&#39;t need to see, words they don&#39;t need to hear, sex, violence, <br/>\netc.  Is that part of your view of unschooling and letting them make <br/>\nall their own choices with food, bedtimes, helping with family <br/>\nresponsibilites, tv, etc. to not put guidelines on what they can <br/>\nwatch. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd is just 6. She has been in charge of her own tv viewing for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch of the discussion about television stems from the same idea as the<br/>\nother areas of the Big 6 issues (TV/movies, Electronic gaming, Chores,<br/>\nBedtimes, Food, Personal Hygiene/health). To wit: that parental limiting in<br/>\nchildhood is an ineffective strategy for producing older people who make<br/>\ngood, mindful choices from a place of self-knowledge and reasoned<br/>\nunderstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is something I wrote very recently about television content. This is my<br/>\nTV Contents Musings, for those who just read it and wish to skip. The first<br/>\nline is a representative quote from the posts that sparked the whole thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nQuote begins:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The amount of t.v. hasn&#39;t been the problem, but the content.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been the most pronounced incidence of synchronicity that I have yet<br/>\nnoticed on the lists where there have been three mothers posting almost the<br/>\nexact same sentiments on three Unschooling lists [then became FOUR lists the<br/>\nfollowing week], specifically expressing the same concerns about &quot;limiting<br/>\nto appropriate content&quot; with children of varying ages, from 2 yo to 6 year<br/>\nolds, to a 10 yo, and a 14 yo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not really the forum for a lengthy dissertation into the discourses<br/>\nof television comedy, or a dissection of the semiotics of the sitcom as a<br/>\ndepiction of the American family - as entertaining as I would personally<br/>\nfind writing such an essay.<br/>\n<br/>\nNor is it necessarily as helpful to get into a lengthy &quot;I don&#39;t like show<br/>\nX&quot;...&quot;Oh I like show X a lot&quot; debate - because tastes differ, definitions of<br/>\n&quot;vulgar&quot; or funny differ, and it doesn&#39;t really get any further into the<br/>\nprinciples behind the ideas of choice and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere seem to be two issues in reference to the content of tv programs or<br/>\nmovies. The first is the idea that the content, while not necessarily<br/>\nobjectionable in itself, is too &quot;mature&quot; for the children - either too scary<br/>\nor too sexually explicit seem to the main concerns. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first situation I have found, similarly to what others have reported,<br/>\nthat Jayn is very good at self-care if she starts to become scared of<br/>\nimages, sounds or characters&#39; behavior. She also seems to have developed her<br/>\nown specific coping mechanisms for exploring the scary stuff including fast<br/>\nforwarding, going away for a minute, desensitizing herself with repeated<br/>\ngradual exposures, and role-playing games. I too have learnt the kind of<br/>\nmusic or images that disturb her, and will warn her if a program seems<br/>\nlikely to be scary. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of sexually explicit - and people have different places where<br/>\nthey will become concerned - I have found, again similarly to what others<br/>\nhave reported, that Jayn has zero interest in the sexual or even mere<br/>\nromantic antics of people on tv. She certainly is not seeking it out. If<br/>\nsomething comes on in the course of changing channels or she walks into the<br/>\nother room and something is on, she gets a kind of &quot;that looks stupid&quot;<br/>\nexpression and usually totally ignores it. At around 3, she used to enjoy<br/>\n&quot;Sex and the City&quot; because she liked the pretty dresses and sparkles, and<br/>\nwould just go play with her dolls during any of the incomprehensible to her<br/>\nsexual scenes. Now she just lumps adult themed shows of any kind (eg police<br/>\ndrama) together as &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;stupid garbage&quot; and asks for Disney channel.<br/>\nIt is only a matter of time before she starts expressing ideas and seeking<br/>\nclarification (her version of asking questions) on the odd sexual scenes she<br/>\nbumps into at times on tv.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** I will add that I believe that she will start seeking out or being<br/>\nattracted to programs with sexual content (of any kind) at the appropriate<br/>\ndevelopmental time when her inner questioning arrives at that place - or to<br/>\nput it conversely, she won&#39;t be interested until and unless she is &quot;ready&quot;<br/>\nto receive that kind of information, coupled with the additional guidance<br/>\nthat I will be able to give her about the level of reality that she is<br/>\nseeing. I try to see every new program as an opportunity for more<br/>\ncommunication between us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second issue of concern has to do with the &quot;family values&quot; and behavior<br/>\nand relationships of characters in the shows. I have to agree that both the<br/>\ncharacters and the situations in teen sitcoms and movies often depict values<br/>\nthat are in conflict with the ideas of Unschooling, including lousy<br/>\nparenting, adults as adversarial and dumb simultaneously, and sibling<br/>\nconflict portrayed as normal and acceptable. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever whether these values are going to be genuinely internalized and<br/>\nadopted by our children is another question. I personally doubt it, despite<br/>\nthe experimental forays into these less than charming behaviors our kids<br/>\nsometimes engage in. I am seeing it for the first time - Jayn has started<br/>\ncalling me &quot;stupid head&quot; at odd times - from &quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot; (movie). I<br/>\nhave Trust that it will get old soon. I also endorse the idea of talking<br/>\nover in a genuine way specific behaviors or ideas, rather than making a<br/>\nnegative assessment of the show your kid loves. (I come and blurt the latter<br/>\nonto the lists instead of onto Jayn). ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from the fact that I doubt that any of us are remotely like any of<br/>\nthese detached, authoritarian or befuddled parents, the biggest, hugest,<br/>\nmost significant difference between our children and 100percent of the kids<br/>\nportrayed on any of these shows is: they are all in mandatory school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese TV children&#39;s primary bonding relationships are shown as being with<br/>\ntheir friends and age peers, and with few exceptions, the majority of their<br/>\ntime is spent in the school hallways, on school related projects, including<br/>\nsome really contrived nonsense, and conversing with each other about school<br/>\nstuff or school people. Additionally, with the one exception of Ren Stevens<br/>\nwho likes it and is a butt of humor for that reason, they seem consider<br/>\nschool a necessary evil. <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that these shows portray a heightened and exaggerated depiction of<br/>\nwhat we Unschoolers would consider some of the very real negatives of school<br/>\nas they apply to family life - the appropriation of almost all time with the<br/>\nconcomitant disintegration of close family relationships, the culture of<br/>\npeer approval and cliques and personality labeling (&quot;jocks&quot;, &quot;geeks&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;popular girls&quot;, etc), the separation and fostering of distrust and<br/>\ndisconnection between parents and children, the adult (parent or teacher) as<br/>\nboth incomprehensible and a killjoy even while they are &quot;humorously&quot;<br/>\ninfantile (esp. males), children as directly powerless in the face of school<br/>\nor parental rules so resorting to underhand strategies (hi jinks ensue!<br/>\n:P~~). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe entertainment value of these shows to schooled children, who undoubtedly<br/>\nrecognize themselves to a much greater degree, is likely partly in that very<br/>\nseparation from the parents. The tv kids usually spend almost no time in<br/>\nclass of any kind - more wishful thinking for the schooled kids. It is<br/>\npossible that these tv kids have more personal power and autonomy than the<br/>\nreal children - they certainly will do more outlandish stuff. The didactic<br/>\n&quot;mother knows best in the end&quot; message of most of these shows, is a small<br/>\nprice to pay (I mean for the schooled child viewers) for getting to watch<br/>\npeople make really dumb choices (dumber than they might make irl) and follow<br/>\nthrough the absurd results. I notice that &quot;grounding&quot; is the universal<br/>\npunishment, applied even after the &quot;lesson&quot; has been learned. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that most of our children have much less identification with the<br/>\ncharacters. Maybe they watch this stuff with the same sense of disbelieving<br/>\nastonishment that some of us apply to Jerry Springer, or with the same<br/>\ncuriosity as pausing to view a car wreck or collapsed building. It is the<br/>\nvery &quot;otherness&quot; of these families that makes them interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Jayn what she likes about &quot;That&#39;s So Raven&quot;, her current favorite. I<br/>\ndiscovered that her attraction to the show comes from her enjoyment of<br/>\nRaven&#39;s dress up as odd characters antics, and also she likes Raven&#39;s<br/>\nregular clothing which is heavy on the sparkle, feathers and embroidery. We<br/>\nrecord the programs, and sometimes if one of the other characters is the<br/>\nfeatured story that day, she will ask me to skip over those scenes that do<br/>\nnot include Raven herself. In other words the actual narrative or internal<br/>\n&quot;logic&quot; is irrelevant to Jayn&#39;s enjoyment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past Jayn has included shows that I don&#39;t like (for values) in her<br/>\nviewing schedule. Her interest has waned, not because I made any attempt to<br/>\nlimit, but because she received all she needed and her interests matured. We<br/>\nhad lots of conversations about specific moments that I disapproved of,<br/>\nalong the lines of other choices the characters could have made in those<br/>\nmoments.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike schooled kids, our children have the opportunity to continue to have<br/>\nauthentic relationships with us. We can continue to be the first and primary<br/>\nvalues influence in their lives, as well as their strongest safety net,<br/>\nregardless of what tv shows they like. I hope that it is our huge presence<br/>\nin their lives, and willingness to really listen without a hidden agenda,<br/>\nthat will ultimately mitigate any of the experimental &quot;bad&quot; behavior that<br/>\nthey may try on. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Things <br/>\nthey don&#39;t need to see, words they don&#39;t need to hear, sex, violence, <br/>\netc.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do your children have an interest in sex and violence?  My 10 yo still<br/>\nlikes to watch Arthur and dislikes any of the violent movies that dh brings<br/>\nhome.  She&#39;d much rather watch Little House on the Prairie or play a game<br/>\nwith me than watch what he chooses.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t about sitting your children in front of sexually explicit violent<br/>\nmovies and saying here, you can watch this if you want to.  And if they were<br/>\ninterested in a movie that you felt might be too much for them, watch it<br/>\nfirst, then please, watch it with them and warm them if you feel that<br/>\nsomething coming up might upset them.  Discuss it with them.  Teach them to<br/>\nlisten to their own inner voice about what is o.k. and what is upsetting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also worth discussing with them, if they hear words that you&#39;d rather<br/>\nthey not repeat, that some things are o.k. in the privacy of your home that<br/>\nare not o.k. to share with the neighbor kids.  If they can&#39;t respect that<br/>\nthen maybe they aren&#39;t ready to view such things.  My kids&#39; vocabularies<br/>\naround our house are very different from what they use with Grandma or in<br/>\nother public places.  Just like my own vocabulary around my friends, was<br/>\nvery different that the language I used in my parent&#39;s home when I was a<br/>\nkid.  Kids can learn to discern what is appropriate at different times and<br/>\nwhat is not.  They are smart!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the one thing that makes kids want to watch rated R movies, is to make a<br/>\nbig deal out of it all their lives so they end up wanting to watch just to<br/>\nsay the did.  If you help them decide what to watch based on their interests<br/>\nand not some rating, then they will trust you to help them meet their needs<br/>\nand not just restrict them because they are too young.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to run.
