But when<br/>\na little boy showed up that was quite disfigured in the face Ian<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to stay much longer. I was also a little sad how Ian<br/>\nresponded. I really feel that it is not good to put our expectations<br/>\non him and I didn&#39;t push anything. This is how it went. when Ian<br/>\nfinally saw the boy first he started staring. Which I wanted to too<br/>\nbut I know ... so I just whispered in Ians ears that sometimes people<br/>\ndon&#39;t always look the same but it was ok and he was just like him<br/>\n(something like that?). but when the boy was near Ian kind of made the<br/>\ncomment to me that he didn&#39;t want to play with someone like that????<br/>\nat one point I even had a opportunity to help the dad get the little<br/>\nboy down from something (I was afraid he might fall -- but like most<br/>\nlittle guys he was just fine) so I showed Ian that it was ok --- I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t plan that it just happened and later I realized that just maybe<br/>\nIan saw that I was worried, or scared of the little guy so maybe.???<br/>\nAnyway when we left I tried to explain some more about sometimes<br/>\npeople are born or have accidents that do this .....What do we do in<br/>\nthese situations???? I can&#39;t make Ian play with him and I&#39;m sure the<br/>\nlittle boy did look scary or weird to Ian.<br/>\nI just felt sad. I can only imagine how the dad feels -- he has to<br/>\nget that -- people staring, little kids not playing with him.. He<br/>\nbrought him at a time when there was no one -- just us -- Gosh<br/>\nsometimes this world is tough.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32961,"nextTopicId":32966}}
