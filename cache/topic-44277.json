We would LOVE to meet up with other unschoolers if there are any of you close by!  Visiting my sister is always tough for me, as we are different in most ways that matter, but I maintain the connection mostly so my girls can be friends with their cousins.  If we connect with a few other like-minded people over the holiday, it would help me stay sane!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can email me offlist at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jodibezzola@...\">jodibezzola@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks :)<br/>\nJodi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44241,"nextTopicId":44096}}
