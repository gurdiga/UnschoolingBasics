My dh has gotten MUCH more confident since he met me (luckily when he was only 16), because I have let him make mistakes and I&#39;m not overly worried about things going wrong.  My dh wore his cell phone into the pool 5 days ago and he STILL hasn&#39;t heard the end of it from his mom.  I just say - oh well, lesson learned-or not!

We have two amazing boys: Ethan, age<br/>\n8,  and Ryan, age 5. A small bit of introduction since I&#39;ve never<br/>\nintroduced us. (Yes, I am yet another unlurker. Is that a word?! It<br/>\nought to be one!) We have 3 mommies in our house: Mimi, Mama, and Ba.<br/>\n Mimi and Ba have a small business and this lets us unschool the<br/>\nchildren (aka hang out and play with them). Mama has a &quot;real job&quot; and<br/>\nshe earns a steady income which makes everyone happy. Mimi and Ba are<br/>\non board with RU more or less. Mama is on board with not dealing with<br/>\nit. That said, we (Mimi and Ba) have a few things about which you all<br/>\nmight have useful input.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of our guys adore their DS&#39;s. They want them to be fully charged<br/>\nand accessible at all times. This is just great with us. We are happy<br/>\nto charge them and make sure they are safe and snug. Ryan thinks this<br/>\nrocks. Ethan thinks this is great except when he wants to have his in<br/>\nhis room where the cartridges or even the DS get lost, or forgets to<br/>\ngive it to us for charging, or wants to eat soup and play with it even<br/>\nthough soup + DS = fizzle-boom. (Ethan&#39;s phrasing.) Ethan desperately<br/>\nwants us to take charge of it. He says we should be in charge of<br/>\nkeeping it safe and making sure it&#39;s charged. The problem arises when<br/>\nwe say &quot;Hey dude DS and food don&#39;t mix. Do you want us to hold it for<br/>\nyou?&quot; <br/>\nEthan moves the DS half an inch from the bowl and ignores us. <br/>\n&quot;Ethan, do you want us to take that for you?&quot; <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ll just put it here.&quot; (Where here is 1 inch from the bowl of soup.)<br/>\n&quot;OK. Just remember that you might spill soup on it OK?&quot; <br/>\n&quot;But I won&#39;t.&quot; <br/>\n&quot;OK.&quot; <br/>\nThis is where the spoon clatters to the floor and soup spills on the<br/>\nDS. &quot;Oh no!! My DS! Is it OK?!&quot; <br/>\n&quot;Um, this time I think so. Why don&#39;t we put it on the stairs now?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;*harrumph* OK. *sigh*&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we feel like maybe we are harassing/haranguing him. Sometimes the<br/>\nscenario is more whining on his part. Sometimes the scenario is more<br/>\nwhining on our part. We&#39;d really like to cut down on the conflict and<br/>\nthe whining. When asked if he&#39;d rather be responsible for his own DS,<br/>\nhe always says, &quot;No! No no no! I want you to take of it for me.&quot; When<br/>\nwe say, &quot;Ethan, you need to help us to take care of the DS by giving<br/>\nit to us when you&#39;re not using it,&quot; he sometimes gives it to us and<br/>\nsometimes doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, we&#39;re asking how people here handle responsibility for<br/>\npersonal belongings. It was easy when Ethan was younger; we&#39;d just<br/>\ntake care of his stuff. Now he&#39;s older and wants to be more<br/>\nresponsible, but doesn&#39;t want to, well, be more responsible in that it<br/>\ncomes with a certain amount of risk. (He could lose/damage stuff he<br/>\nreally cares about.) We&#39;re over whining and struggling and so is he.<br/>\n(It might be good to say here that we&#39;ve always unschooled, but have<br/>\nonly been moving toward RU for a few months.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve donned both our listening ears and our protective gear ;) Let<br/>\nthe thoughts/ideas/suggestions fly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nMimi and Ba (sometimes called Esther and Jean Elizabeth)<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp:/3mommies.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35054,"nextTopicId":35059}}
