It&#39;s something kids will start to do voluntarily around puberty, even if you never &quot;make them&quot; clean up. You can ask them to help, and when it makes sense for them to do so (makes sense To them) and they have the time in their busy, busy lives, they&#39;ll pitch in, but it&#39;s better not to hang your hopes on that. When they have the time and energy, the perspective and empathy to do so, they&#39;ll help out - that&#39;s true even of toddlers, but their perspective isn&#39;t very broad yet, so they only help out in ways that make sense from Their perspective. If you want to support that desire to help, see the ways your children are kind and thoughtful already, in their own ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething to consider in terms of cleaning: in much of the adult world it&#39;s common for people to Not clean up their own messes. There are whole occupations around cleaning and the busier a person or job site is, the more like there will be people (individuals or entire subcontracted businesses) whose specific job is to clean. It&#39;s mainly in the home and with children that cleaning is seen as a task of those who are otherwise engaged.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":366445945,"authorName":"Carolyn","from":"Carolyn &lt;ch1qui74@...&gt;","profile":"ch1qui74","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Creating an enriching environment...","postDate":"1317522789","msgId":47423,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUxQzYyOEU0LUQzNkYtNDUyQi1COTEyLUUwOUQwRkU3MEUwNEB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47417,"nextInTopic":47424,"prevInTime":47422,"nextInTime":47424,"topicId":47367,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks that really helped.

Chances are your kids see the fill-dump game as great fun! So you might do that with them as an actual game at some point during the day. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut for cleaning, it could help to try to arrange your day so the kids are doing something like watch a movie or work on a project when dad comes in. That gives you time to do a quick run through right before he walks in the door. George actually does something like that for me, now that I&#39;m the working parent, but with the kitchen - he runs through, clears the counters and starts doing dishes so the kitchen looks pretty good when I walk through the door. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving the Very First room your husband sees clear of clutter will probably go a long way. Does he come in right into the &quot;living room&quot; or wherever the toys mostly are? That&#39;s harder, but if you can engage the kids in something specific you may be able to gain enough breathing space to have the entry picked up for a little while. Does he like to be greeted at the door? You could have them do a project to present to him when he comes it. That&#39;s a big thrill for some dads/working parents - happy children running up with presents for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey won&#39;t be this little forever!

Lots of stuff to dump and destroy sounds nicely rich to me ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonality matters. Some kids interact with the world very physically - young children do this in general, but some kids much more so than others. If your kids are dumping, make sure they have lots of things to dump. In part, they&#39;re learning about the physical properties of the world - about causes and effects, gravity, and entropy. If they also like to play with small toys, keep those kinds of effects in mind. What can they shake, stir, pour, toss, squish and smash? Help them find those things. <br/>\n<br/>\nDestroying is important to some kids. Again, its a way of learning about physical properties. What are things Made of? A very young child conceptualizes the whole question in very direct ways, but the question itself is one that can motivate people to a life of learning through dis-assembly. Engineering and surgery, choreography, computer programming and literary review all depend on breaking things down into smaller parts - destruction. So if you have a destroyer in the house, help him or her find the &quot;right&quot; things to destroy so your house is still standing afterwards ;) That may mean going to thrift stores to buy things to disassemble - toys to electronics to bicycles. My brother used to take things apart and he just got his third patent!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ~ Are my little kids bored, or are they just being little kids?

It can be easier - and make more sense to kids - to clean something at the beginning of a project rather than the end, for instance. &quot;Let&#39;s clean the table so we can get out the play-dough&quot; makes more sense than cleaning up at some ill-defined &quot;end&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to plan outings to save on housework in poor weather - if kids are inside all day for days on end, things can get crazy in terms of mess and parental overwhelm, so it can help to get out and let them play somewhere else. That&#39;s another way to make life bigger and richer, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ~ Are my little kids bored...?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Watch them. Do they Seem bored, or are they having fun? At their age, &quot;bored&quot; generally means they need more attention, so if you think boredom is a problem, spend more time where they are, doing what they&#39;re doing and offering to do things with them. Invite them along when you&#39;re doing tasks around the house, too- let them see the big, important grown-up world and invite them to take part in it. That&#39;s good fun for little kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237699340,"authorName":"Kristie","from":"Kristie &lt;messy_boys@...&gt;","profile":"messy_boys","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Creating an enriching environment...","postDate":"1317302785","msgId":47367,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTczMDI3ODUuODQ0OTUuWWFob29NYWlsUkNAd2ViODExMDcubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47368,"prevInTime":47366,"nextInTime":47368,"topicId":47367,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would love to hear your thoughts and experience with providing an interesting and enriching environment for your children.

I have several young children, and <br/>\nit is hard to have much out because they are always dumping or destroying...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess this is really two questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ What does providing and interesting and enriching environment look like at <br/>\nyour house?<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Are my little kids bored, or are they just being little kids?  They are 5, 3 <br/>\nand 2.  My house looks like a tornado hit it every single day.  I try to limit <br/>\nthe chaos by limiting what&#39;s out...but on the other hand, I&#39;d love to have more <br/>\nthings available, such as puzzles and games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKristie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47289,"nextTopicId":47441}}
