He was a rough and tumble,<br/>\nclimbing through the trees (falling out fo the trees), over the river and<br/>\nthrough the ditch culverts from dawn to dusk (Oh what a life he would have<br/>\nhad if my parents had unschooled him!)  Anyway, today he still gets bruises<br/>\nall over.  His doctors used to say that he was anemic, but when they would<br/>\ntest him his iron counts always came out fine.  Once he had to go in for<br/>\nsomething and the doctor noticed all the bruises.  Asked my mom to step out<br/>\nof the room so he could talk to him alone.  My mom thought it was a &quot;guy&quot;<br/>\ndiscussion that he might be too embarassed to talk about with mom in the<br/>\nroom.  About 5 minutes into the interview my mother his great rolls of<br/>\nlaughter coming out of the office.  The doctor opened his door with tears<br/>\nrolling down his face.  He thought my brother was an abused child as many<br/>\nparents who abuse will hit their children&#39;s legs.  When he asked my brother<br/>\nabout his bruising and where he got them my brother launched into this story<br/>\nabout how he and Timmy &quot;climbed up in the Chinaberry tree.  But don&#39;t tell<br/>\nmy mom because we aren&#39;t supposed to climbe the Chinaberry tree.  Anyway, we<br/>\ngot near the top and all the little Chinaberry branches started to snap off<br/>\nand the next thing me and  Timmy knew we were falling through the Chinaberry<br/>\ntree and couldn&#39;t stop.  We fell all the way to the bottom.  But PLEASE<br/>\ndon&#39;t tell my mom.  She told us that would happen and I don&#39;t want her to<br/>\nknow we found out the hard way.&quot;  This was followed with other escapades of<br/>\nmy brother, Timmy and George and many trees they had encountered and forts<br/>\nthey had built and games of war they had played using clay dirt clods as<br/>\nammunition.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they aren&#39;t hurting him, he is eating well and they heal within a few<br/>\ndays I wouldn&#39;t worry.
