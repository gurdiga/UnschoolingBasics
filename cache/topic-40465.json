We would be happy to organize this. Since it&#39;s<br/>\nsummer,  let&#39;s start with outdoor places and find somewhere indoors later in<br/>\nthe year. (We have a few options in mind.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about everyone emails us privately and says what days do and do not work<br/>\nfor them? We will pick a day that works for most people. We would love to<br/>\nmake it a weekly or biweekly thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso email where you live and we can pick a nice playground/park in the<br/>\nmiddle of everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we have what works best for us I will post it to other lists in case<br/>\nthere are others out there who do not know of these lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can&#39;t wait to get our kids together. Our kids have gotten so much out of<br/>\nbeing with other unschoolers at conferences. We would love to have that on a<br/>\nmore regular basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\n<br/>\nEsther and Jean Elizabeth<br/>\nand Ethan (age 9) and Ryan (age: 1 week until I&#39;m 6!!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40451,"nextTopicId":40455}}
