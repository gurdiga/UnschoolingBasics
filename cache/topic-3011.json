This is<br/>\nmainly about fairy tales and how they are the best tools of problem solving<br/>\nwe can give our children. Bettelheim says that children live in a magical<br/>\nworld up to puberty and our grown-up &#39;face facts of reality&#39; attitude does<br/>\nnot cater to their &#39;beingness&#39; at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many of us don&#39;t listen to our intuition any more because we were taught<br/>\nnot to believe in irrational things?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and on the subject of death a friend just yesterday told us about a<br/>\nlittle girl who came up with a wonderful explanation after the experience of<br/>\na funeral. &quot;It is like a bottle of coke. It&#39;s bubbly and alive when it is<br/>\nfull. When the contents is gone, it is an empty bottle (the body that is<br/>\nburied) and not needed any more.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Alexander was fascinated by the cemetery for a while. So we took some<br/>\ntime and walked around the older and newer parts of our local cemetery. At<br/>\nsome point he mentioned, &quot;But the &#39;longing&#39; is still there.&quot; He used the<br/>\nGerman word &quot;Sehnen&quot; which sounds like &#39;Seele&#39; which means &#39;soul&#39;. This gave<br/>\nhim full satisfaction about this subject. Our children know what they<br/>\nwant/need to know and how to get the answers that are right for them. Isn&#39;t<br/>\nthis what unschooling is all about?<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessed be<br/>\nUlrike</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3010,"nextTopicId":2994}}
