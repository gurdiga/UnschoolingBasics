My name is Angela.  I am Mom to three children ages 11, 9<br/>\nand 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are lucky enough to live in St. Louis where the Live and Learn conference<br/>\nwas this past year.  It was such a joy to have been able to attend.  I was<br/>\nnot on any unschooling lists until the conference.<br/>\n<br/>\n We have homeschooled since the beginning.  I had read most of the books<br/>\nthat everyone seems to recommend and my heart was there for years.   We<br/>\nunschooled for a few years until I became very insecure in my decision.  All<br/>\nof the homeschoolers that I seemed to meet around town were &quot;school at<br/>\nhomers&quot; so I wavered in my decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, my heart was there but my head was still stuck in school.  I<br/>\nguess that&#39;s why it wasn&#39;t much of a stretch for me to waver and start<br/>\nschool at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here we are now,  Post conference.  Thankful for it all.  We are already<br/>\nplanning on going to New Mexico next year.  I have never traveled on a long<br/>\nvacation to the West.  It has always been to the East to visit family.  This<br/>\nwill be quit a change for us but it should be an awesome time!  We are<br/>\nexcited already and looking for fun things to do on the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly mentioned the conference CD&#39;s a while back.  If you didn&#39;t get  the<br/>\nchance to attend you really should get them.  But even if you attended like<br/>\nI did they will be good to listen to again.  We listened to our  MP3 on a 14<br/>\nhour car trip and it was so wonderful.  We got to hear the sessions that we<br/>\nsomehow missed that weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra and Ren&#39;s session on Mindful Parenting was so great.  It seemed to<br/>\nhave come at just the right time (driving home from a week visiting my Mom)<br/>\nand I am really thankful for that one.  Thank you , Ren, for that.  And<br/>\nSandra, too, but I don&#39;t think she&#39;s on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch Joy!<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8416,"nextTopicId":8409}}
