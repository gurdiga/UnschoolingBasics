She began asking me to find her some way to pursue her interest <br/>\nmore intensely and we found out that the community college has ASL <br/>\nclasses. Community college courses are a bargain here in California - <br/>\nkids who are still under 18 often don&#39;t have to pay anything except some <br/>\nsmall fees. So, for $15 she could have 18 weeks of twice per week ASL <br/>\nclass. A bargain and she LOVED it.

There are alternatives for those who have worked in the <br/>\nfield for years, but not for people new to the field.

If a child (or adult, for that matter), truly wants to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-408315361\">One additional thought to Ren&#39;s note below - why are we even talking/thinking about college at all? If a child (or adult, for that matter), truly wants to pursue a passion that would &quot;require&quot; math to either get into or complete college, such as mechanical engineering or physical therapy, then I would imagine the parent would sit down with the child, review the requirements for entry, and work together to find a way to gain the necessary skills. In such cases, where the decision to go to college is child-led and a natural outcome of their passion, I think you&#39;ll see the kids do whatever it takes to get into the college and succeed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, a strict unschooling view would suggest a few things. First, we&#39;re trying to help our kids develop their own sense of what success means for them and how they should best pursue it. While success for many of us may mean college and a corporate job and a nice car and early retirement, we&#39;re trying to help our kids define it on their own terms and in their own ways. Therefore, kids should go to college if it is important to THEM, not because you feel it is important for them to do. Maybe they&#39;ll decide to go when they&#39;re 18; maybe they&#39;ll decide to go when they&#39;re 14; maybe they&#39;ll decide to go when they&#39;re 34; and maybe they&#39;ll decide to not go at all. As they grow up and experience a life of freedom and choice, they&#39;ll make the decisions that are right for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I think about our kids and the study of specific &quot;subjects&quot; (or the absence of such study), I think of it like this: most people view their life through a telescope. Telescopes are great because you can see specific things far into the distance, which makes it really easy to plot out exactly how to get from here to there. Our kids, however, view life through the small end of a giant funnel. They may not be able to see as far or in as much focus, but they can see far more. What I try to avoid is subconsciously forcing my kids to turn their funnels into telescopes, narrowing their choices so they&#39;ll focus on the future. the future is THEIRS, not mine; I want them to have lived in a world of possibilities so that they can make informed, contextual choices based on experience.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: gruvystarchild &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, September 19, 2009 7:17:35 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: roadschooling and MATH<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n~~But how do you know you need it if you have never been exposed to it?

I&#39;ve had to learn the mathematical language of carpentry, and its a different language than I learned in school. Not only that, I&#39;m having to learn it in &quot;spanglish&quot; too, so I can talk to Spanish speaking trim carpenters. Maybe you&#39;re hoping your son will never have to walk onto a construction site as anything below the level of engineer, but my parents hoped that for me, once upon a time. So in retrospect, I learned the wrong languages; French instead of Spanish and college math instead of carpenter math. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;, he might not love it as much as he does, therefore not go into<br/>\n&gt; it. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know very many people who love mathematics for its language. Its the Ideas that are gorgeous. Mathematicians create new languages as they become frustrated with existing languages not describing those ideas well enough. The ideas exisit without the descriptors, without books and studying. Its the ideas that pull people in and fascinate them. More often the language pushes people away. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to study music theory to play the piano, or study art history to paint - those are things that people who enjoy what they are doing may be drawn to study, though. Those topics can help answer question like &quot;how do I portray emotion via this medium?&quot; Similarly, you don&#39;t need to know the language of trignometry to build a stair case or a gabled roof, but in the process of building you may become inspired to learn that language, to enhance your process and performance. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think there is power in knowledge.  The more I learn the more I realize I<br/>\n&gt; have to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whether or not knowledge is empowering has a lot to do with how you (generic you) conceptualize your own personal power. Having knowledge can make you feel powerful, but it can just as easily make you feel powerLess. People regularly push away knowledge because it undermines their sense of personal power. In my own life, I&#39;ve found it helpful to move away from the idea that knowledge is tied to power to the idea that I find joy in learning and knowing and in knowing I have more to learn. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And we have found the more they know about mathematics, the<br/>\n&gt; more creatively they solve problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s great! Especially if its something they are enjoying and feels empowering to them. I&#39;m not trying to say you should prevent your kids from playing around with mathematics! My 8yo has specifically asked us to buy books on mathematics on occasion - its a lot of fun for her. But I don&#39;t ever ask her to do them, or do them in a particular way or order or timeframe. Its no more or less important than her comic books or stuffed animals. That sounds dismissive, but its not intended to be, the opposite, actually. Rather than &quot;putting down&quot; math, I&#39;m upholding all her interests, because they are all valuable to my kid. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that kids don&#39;t necessarily see all the<br/>\n&gt; possibilities out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Neither do adults. And WE have more baggage than they do. Sometimes kids can see possibilities to which adults are blind. Isn&#39;t that the wonderful part of childhood? The starry eyed looks that see right past all our grown-up obstacles? That&#39;s what I want to nurture in my kids, that sense of possibilities where others see limits. Climb the wall and look over it! Here, I&#39;ll help you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; We don&#39;t want to close mathematical doors for the boys<br/>\n&gt; by choosing not to suggest it for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You really can&#39;t know what doors you open and which you close. By choosing your current adventure, other doors are shut. They can&#39;t possibly be learning to play the cello with all that bicycling! By choosing to encourage math, you&#39;ve ignored something else, tofu making, for example. Those may seem like silly examples, but you have No way of knowing what lies in the future. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not to say you shouldn&#39;t strew new things and ideas and opportunites - strew away! Suggest and offer and encourage! But do those things with an eye on your kids&#39; joy and fascination Right Now, not whatever they Might do ten, twenty years down the road. Beyond uncertainty about the future, when you focus on what your kids Might need and be down the road, you aren&#39;t seeing them clearly for Who They Are right now, and that&#39;s a loss.
