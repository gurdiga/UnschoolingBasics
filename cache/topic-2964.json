Even then, it was several years before I had <br/>\ntime to use one. I have a few thoughts on the way you&#39;re looking at <br/>\nthe &quot;interruptions.&quot; :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you change the way you look at things; the things you look at <br/>\nwill change. (Wayne Dyer)<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t see ______ as an acceptable interruption when Laurie needed <br/>\nme to nourish her - spiritually, physically or otherwise. Fill in <br/>\nthe blank as you choose. Anything and everything will fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we see our children&#39;s needs as interruptions, they feel it. <br/>\nShe&#39;s learning that your computer time is more important to you than <br/>\nnourishing her. Maybe mama milk isn&#39;t what she REALLY wants. Maybe <br/>\nshe needs to know that she is number one to you, right then, when <br/>\nshe needs to know it, no matter what you&#39;re doing. Being a child is <br/>\nscary and removing all scariness is a time-consuming job for a <br/>\nparent, but it&#39;s a job with more benefits than you can imagine - <br/>\nbenefits that will become obvious to you as she gets older.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Laurie is 24 now and recently moved away to pursue her PhD.   <br/>\nLast night, I finally sat down at the computer to attempt to write <br/>\nsome notes to help me with my speech in Peabody this weekend. I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t intend on putting it off until the last minute, but it <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t be helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I had been typing for about a minute and a half (seriously) <br/>\nand the phone rang. It was Laurie, bubbling over with news about her <br/>\nfirst day in some of her classes. She started describing each <br/>\nprofessor that she&#39;ll be working with, the classroom, etc. I reached <br/>\nup and minimized what I had typed so I wouldn&#39;t be distracted from <br/>\nher phone call. She babbled and shared and &quot;interrupted&quot; me for over <br/>\nan hour. She told about her grocery shopping trip and how she found <br/>\norganic apples at the Winn Dixie.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she told me how much she loved me and how much it meant to her <br/>\nthat I always had time for her, in the past and now. She <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Knowing you, you were right in the middle of something <br/>\nimportant...but I&#39;ll never know about it, huh?&quot; I laughed and told <br/>\nher that nothing was more important to me than hearing from her. <br/>\n(I&#39;m SO grateful for cell phones) She said, &quot;Yeah, I am pretty <br/>\nwonderful, huh?&quot;  Yeah, she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you see that as an acceptable interruption since we&#39;re living <br/>\napart for the first time in 24 years and of course we&#39;re missing <br/>\neach other! Would you still see it as acceptable if you knew it <br/>\nhappened every day? It does. <br/>\n<br/>\nI miss the times when she crawled onto my lap for nourishment, but <br/>\nas far as I&#39;m concerned she&#39;s really still doing that, and there is <br/>\nnothing that will ever be more important to me than giving her <br/>\nnourishment. I figure that I was put on this earth to be Laurie&#39;s <br/>\nmom and anything else is lagniappe (cajun french word for &#39;extra&#39;).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it means that I only have a few hours to throw together some <br/>\nnotes for my speech at the Live & Learn conference, then the parents <br/>\nthere will understand, realize and KNOW that my speech about Laurie <br/>\nisn&#39;t as important as Laurie herself. I&#39;d rather fall short of an <br/>\nawesome speech than tell Laurie I&#39;m too busy to talk. (sorry <br/>\nconference goers. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nFinding your priorities is a very helpful thing. Will it matter five <br/>\nyears from now that you had uninterrupted computer time? No. Will it <br/>\nmatter five years from now that you welcomed her into your lap for <br/>\nnourishment everytime she wanted it? Yes. <br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly can&#39;t think of a single thing that I put off and suffered <br/>\nover so that I could nourish Laurie.

It was late at night, I was in the basement folding clothes <br/>\nthinking about how tired I was and how I wished I didn&#39;t need to do <br/>\nlaundry right then. <br/>\nI stopped myself right there and thought about many conversations <br/>\nI&#39;d had at unschooling.com, and realized it was my choice to feel <br/>\nthis way. I looked at the  pile of laundry and realized how very, <br/>\nvery fortunate I really was.<br/>\nEach and every piece of clothing was a symbol of a loved one, that <br/>\nwas still with me. I began to fold that laundry with a thankful <br/>\nheart, hoping that I&#39;d have many more opportunities to fold my <br/>\nmothers laundry.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t.<br/>\nShe died two years ago and I&#39;d give anything to fold her laundry, <br/>\nwash her hair and tell stories at night before bed (she was a <br/>\nstoryteller).<br/>\nWhen I get frustrated today, I stop, and look around at the lovely <br/>\nmesses that represent my loved ones. They are with me...and I am <br/>\ngrateful.<br/>\nThe crumbs on the counter mean they are healthy and eating. The pile <br/>\nof dirty dishes is a sign that we have enough food to eat, the dirty <br/>\nlaundry means we have nice clothing we enjoy and fun activities to <br/>\nget it dirty with.:)<br/>\nEverything in this entire life is about choices. There are always <br/>\nsituations and people we didn&#39;t choose, but how we respond is <br/>\ntotally about perspective and decisions.<br/>\nI choose to be thankful today. I&#39;m glad that my toddler can still <br/>\nnurse and recieve nourishment and comfort. I&#39;m glad that Sierra <br/>\nwants me to stop typing and watch another cartwheel, it means she <br/>\nstill sees me as an important part of her life. I&#39;m glad Trevor is <br/>\nbugging me to use the computer right now because it means he enjoys <br/>\nresearching his interests and learning new things. I&#39;m glad Jared is <br/>\nasking me to make him Cream of Wheat for the millionth time in the <br/>\nlast two days, because it means I&#39;m buying a food he likes!:) And <br/>\nheck, it&#39;s pretty easy as far as food requests go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThankfulness is a choice.

Maybe mama milk isn&#39;t what she REALLY wants. Maybe <br/>\n  she needs to know that she is number one to you, right then, when <br/>\n  she needs to know it, no matter what you&#39;re doing. Being a child is <br/>\n  scary and removing all scariness is a time-consuming job for a <br/>\n  parent, but it&#39;s a job with more benefits than you can imagine - <br/>\n  benefits that will become obvious to you as she gets older.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My Laurie is 24 now and recently moved away to pursue her PhD.   <br/>\n  Last night, I finally sat down at the computer to attempt to write <br/>\n  some notes to help me with my speech in Peabody this weekend. I <br/>\n  didn&#39;t intend on putting it off until the last minute, but it <br/>\n  couldn&#39;t be helped.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, I had been typing for about a minute and a half (seriously) <br/>\n  and the phone rang. It was Laurie, bubbling over with news about her <br/>\n  first day in some of her classes. She started describing each <br/>\n  professor that she&#39;ll be working with, the classroom, etc. I reached <br/>\n  up and minimized what I had typed so I wouldn&#39;t be distracted from <br/>\n  her phone call. She babbled and shared and &quot;interrupted&quot; me for over <br/>\n  an hour. She told about her grocery shopping trip and how she found <br/>\n  organic apples at the Winn Dixie.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then she told me how much she loved me and how much it meant to her <br/>\n  that I always had time for her, in the past and now. She <br/>\n  said, &quot;Knowing you, you were right in the middle of something <br/>\n  important...but I&#39;ll never know about it, huh?&quot; I laughed and told <br/>\n  her that nothing was more important to me than hearing from her. <br/>\n  (I&#39;m SO grateful for cell phones) She said, &quot;Yeah, I am pretty <br/>\n  wonderful, huh?&quot;  Yeah, she is.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Would you see that as an acceptable interruption since we&#39;re living <br/>\n  apart for the first time in 24 years and of course we&#39;re missing <br/>\n  each other! Would you still see it as acceptable if you knew it <br/>\n  happened every day? It does. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I miss the times when she crawled onto my lap for nourishment, but <br/>\n  as far as I&#39;m concerned she&#39;s really still doing that, and there is <br/>\n  nothing that will ever be more important to me than giving her <br/>\n  nourishment. I figure that I was put on this earth to be Laurie&#39;s <br/>\n  mom and anything else is lagniappe (cajun french word for &#39;extra&#39;).<br/>\n<br/>\n  If it means that I only have a few hours to throw together some <br/>\n  notes for my speech at the Live & Learn conference, then the parents <br/>\n  there will understand, realize and KNOW that my speech about Laurie <br/>\n  isn&#39;t as important as Laurie herself.

(sorry <br/>\n  conference goers. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Finding your priorities is a very helpful thing. Will it matter five <br/>\n  years from now that you had uninterrupted computer time? No. Will it <br/>\n  matter five years from now that you welcomed her into your lap for <br/>\n  nourishment everytime she wanted it? Yes. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I honestly can&#39;t think of a single thing that I put off and suffered <br/>\n  over so that I could nourish Laurie. Guess they weren&#39;t really that <br/>\n  important. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s all about choices and letting your child know that she&#39;s number <br/>\n  one with you.

She told about her grocery shopping trip and how she found <br/>\norganic apples at the Winn Dixie.<br/>\n <br/>\nThen she told me how much she loved me and how much it meant to her <br/>\nthat I always had time for her, in the past and now. She <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Knowing you, you were right in the middle of something <br/>\nimportant...but I&#39;ll never know about it, huh?&quot; I laughed and told <br/>\nher that nothing was more important to me than hearing from her. <br/>\n(I&#39;m SO grateful for cell phones) She said, &quot;Yeah, I am pretty <br/>\nwonderful, huh?&quot;  Yeah, she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you see that as an acceptable interruption since we&#39;re living <br/>\napart for the first time in 24 years and of course we&#39;re missing <br/>\neach other! Would you still see it as acceptable if you knew it <br/>\nhappened every day? It does. <br/>\n<br/>\nI miss the times when she crawled onto my lap for nourishment, but <br/>\nas far as I&#39;m concerned she&#39;s really still doing that, and there is <br/>\nnothing that will ever be more important to me than giving her <br/>\nnourishment. I figure that I was put on this earth to be Laurie&#39;s <br/>\nmom and anything else is lagniappe (cajun french word for &#39;extra&#39;).<br/>\n<br/>\n If it means that I only have a few hours to throw together some <br/>\nnotes for my speech at the Live & Learn conference, then the parents <br/>\nthere will understand, realize and KNOW that my speech about Laurie <br/>\nisn&#39;t as important as Laurie herself. I&#39;d rather fall short of an <br/>\nawesome speech than tell Laurie I&#39;m too busy to talk. (sorry <br/>\nconference goers. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nFinding your priorities is a very helpful thing. Will it matter five <br/>\nyears from now that you had uninterrupted computer time? No. Will it <br/>\nmatter five years from now that you welcomed her into your lap for <br/>\nnourishment everytime she wanted it? Yes. <br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly can&#39;t think of a single thing that I put off and suffered <br/>\nover so that I could nourish Laurie. Guess they weren&#39;t really that <br/>\nimportant. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all about choices and letting your child know that she&#39;s number <br/>\none with you. It&#39;s the wisest choice I ever made.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to the speech notes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nlove, Valerie<br/>\nwww.ubpub.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren","from":"&quot;Ren&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"personal boundaries...was: intro. and manners","postDate":"1093443532","msgId":2964,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwODI1LjA3MTk0MC4xMjY3NS40MTYxMzZAd2VibWFpbDEzLm55Yy51bnRkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2965,"prevInTime":2963,"nextInTime":2965,"topicId":2964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If not, what can I do?

My big thing is getting typing/computer time. EVERY time, <br/>\nlike right now, I sit she wants mama milk...is 2.5 too young for me to refuse? <br/>\nI&#39;m really feeling conflicted about this, and sometimes resentful. I want to do <br/>\nwhat&#39;s best for dd, and usually give in.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a change in the way you see things might help in this situation. Instead of seeing yourself as &quot;giving in&quot;, see it as an opportunity to spend time with a small child that desperately needs you. Yes, I think 2.5 is an exhausting age in many ways, you have to be available at all times it seems, with little time left for yourself. But there ARE ways to meet your needs and hers...you just have to be more creative in those young years.<br/>\nLike setting her up with a great movie and some popcorn before you sit down to type, and expecting to get interrupted will help you detach from that moment when it comes.<br/>\nPersonal boundaries ARE about being honest with what you really want to do, yes....but when a child is very young they need us more and I think it&#39;s really useful to try and detach ourselves from what is happening and be accepting. <br/>\nThis is what she needs right now. This is where your life is right now. Instead of longing for something you don&#39;t have, accept that this moment is perfect, just the way it is. Needy 2 year old and all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often look at things through the perspective of death. Maybe that seems morbid to some, but seeing myself as dead and gone keeps me thinking clearly about what I really want from moment to moment.<br/>\nOr reminding myself that I may not always have that needy toddler with me, or that grumpy teen....keeps me thankful that they are with me, that they are healthy and happy and I get more moments with them today.<br/>\nToday is perfect.<br/>\nThis very moment is perfect.<br/>\nThis may be the very most perfect moment ever, why mess it up wishing things were any different than they are right now?<br/>\nIt&#39;s a very Zen-like way of seeing your life. Unschooling is my Zen.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonal boundaries for me, with a toddler, are about not letting someone hurt me, letting that little person know when their voice is hurting my ears or I don&#39;t like the way in which they&#39;re talking to me.<br/>\n&quot;Jalen, when you say it that way I feel grumpy, can you just tell me NO without screaming?&quot;<br/>\nHe usually calms right down and says &quot;no&quot; much more softly.:)<br/>\nI assume that I am on call at all times with small people in my home...acceptance is a wonderful tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can creatively work it so you get time to  do that which you love....truly. It just takes a proactive method to get to a place where you have some free time. While they&#39;re asleep is one really great time.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3028,"nextTopicId":3044}}
