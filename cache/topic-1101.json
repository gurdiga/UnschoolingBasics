You can give them<br/>\nfreedom and let the learn as they learn, but they are also part of a<br/>\nfamily and the family has to be able to function.  Even the &quot;famiy&quot;<br/>\nhas routine to follow and rules they have to follow and it is<br/>\nimportant that our kids learn that life has rules that they will have<br/>\nto follow.  Setting some bounderies with the understanding that it is<br/>\nnot a punishment but so the whole family can function in a better way-<br/>\n-you know, cooperation, working together-- isn&#39;t a bad thing.  I am<br/>\nnot saying you have to set up strict rules or anything like that, but<br/>\nfinding ways that will work involving the whole family in the<br/>\ndecision making.  This way she is part of the decision and has say in<br/>\nthe choices and sees/understands what is going on and why.<br/>\n8888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888<br/>\n88888888888888<br/>\nThank you for sharing.  I have a four year old and I have required that he<br/>\nparticipate in working together to keep a clutter free home.  I guess a part<br/>\nof me could not care less if someone considers it anti unschooling or not.<br/>\nLimits and letting go and the like in regard to the environment may not be<br/>\nan issue for some families but I have difficulty thinking when I am tripping<br/>\nover toys.  Our house is large with many different play areas and it can get<br/>\naway from both of us if we do not take an active part in picking up.  We<br/>\nusually do it at least every other day.  When Alexander comes to me and asks<br/>\nwhere is this or that toy I can tell him by description because things do<br/>\nhave there place and there is also a drawer that things go if they did not<br/>\nfit into a catagory.  It seems to help the family function better when Alex<br/>\nis not grumbling around the house wondering where the lost toy ended up.<br/>\nThat&#39;s just me.  It really is not that different than the way I had to<br/>\noperate our recovery homes.  People were responsible for cleaning up after<br/>\nthemselves.   Most of the people I know live with others.  I think it is<br/>\nimportant for children to become familiar with the principles of<br/>\norganization and understand that the world we live in is a shared space.<br/>\nOur actions do affect others.  It mortifies me when I see someone throw<br/>\ntrash on the ground or a burning cigarette out the window.  I always wonder<br/>\nwhy that type of person did not learn better by now.  Not everyone figures<br/>\neverything out on their own.  I do believe setting boundaries or offering<br/>\ninstruction for basic life skills will benefit and not harm our children.<br/>\nTo me that is life learning.<br/>\nKay</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1137,"nextTopicId":1149}}
