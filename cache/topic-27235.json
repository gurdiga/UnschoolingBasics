I couldn&#39;t do it.<br/>\nShe was still in ps with over 3000 students when she went pink.<br/>\nNeedless to say, she turned heads everywhere.  The most precious<br/>\nwas all the little girls who would openly stare and smile.  My daughter<br/>\nalways took the time to smile and wave back.<br/>\nVicki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHer hair is beautiful. Thanks so much for attaching a picture. I <br/>\nwould love to do a color like that someday. I&#39;m not quite bold enough <br/>\nto do all my hair, but maybe dye it blonde (currently it is brown) <br/>\nand do the tips in neon pink! Fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nKendrah:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!

The Henna intensifies with the more you put on<br/>\nand it lasts for months.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst she went neon pink.  It was so pink that a wild macaw spotted <br/>\nher and came to visit.  Her hair was so brillant that she could be spotted<br/>\nover three quarters of a mile away.  No joke. Actual measured distance.<br/>\nhttp://s185.photobucket.com/albums/x79/geppetto24/Henna%20works/?action=view&current=CIMG0008.jpg<br/>\n<br/>\nLater she wanted to add other colors so I blended it from pink to deep <br/>\npurple to black on the under layers.   <br/>\nhttp://s185.photobucket.com/albums/x79/geppetto24/Henna%20works/?action=view&current=CIMG0567.jpg<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she finally tired of the bright hair, we bleached it once again (the pink returned some <br/>\nso she looked like Naruto, lol) Then we colored it as close to her natural color and dread locked it.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.dreadheadhq.com/<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took me eight hours just to section it all before I started dreading.  So be forwarned, it&#39;s a big<br/>\nprocess but she looked cute and got lots of compliments from other dreadheads+.  When she tired<br/>\nof dreads, she cut them out and is now sporting an adorable short do, ready to start her professional<br/>\ntraining as a Firefighter.
