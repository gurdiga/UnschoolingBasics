I could use my clothes dryer but I prefer to hang my<br/>\nclothes to dry. I could use my dishwasher (and still do some) but I<br/>\nprefer handwashing my dishes. I could choose to buy all of my food but<br/>\nI prefer growing my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the above choices make a lot more &quot;work&quot; for me, so why do I<br/>\nprefer doing those things?

For me, it&#39;s less about fun sometimes and more<br/>\nabout a deep satisfaction. It&#39;s about being authentic and being true<br/>\nto my priorities which involve living more independently, consuming<br/>\nless and treading gently on the earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople will make good choices for themselves if they can flex their<br/>\ninner guidance often. Humans often choose difficult things when it<br/>\ngets them closer to a goal or desire. I choose hard work because it<br/>\nmakes me feel good.

I don&#39;t have to starve to know good food. I don&#39;t have to suffocate to enjoy breathing. My children don&#39;t have to have hard work to enjoy leisure. I was walking my dog tonight and thinking about this, thinking about the idea of without dark there is no light, but it isn&#39;t true, without dark there just isn&#39;t any dark. Finland gets that, don&#39;t they? So they buy good blinds. <br/>\n<br/>\nHard work can be fun. I like scrubbing the floor. Linnaea does too. Sometimes when she takes a shower she cleans the whole thing. She and Simon cleaned their rooms a couple of months ago, because they wanted to have clean rooms. Then they hung out and watched a movie together. I don&#39;t know if they got the feeling of a well-earned bit of fun. My hope, actually, is that they won&#39;t ever feel that they need to suffer to enjoy. I think it is a very Puritan thing this idea that suffering now pays for future happiness. I don&#39;t have to suffer to enjoy right now. I am full of yummy homemade ravioli and Simon is sitting near me, David brought me a cup of tea and Linnaea is watching the Simpsons.

And where will my kids get that <br/>\n delicious feeling of a well-earned bit of fun from?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell if you are sitting around in your pj&#39;s and watching tv all day everyday you may want to consider being more present with your kids. :) If you really feel slovenly and it makes you unhappy change it !<br/>\n<br/>\nFor kids play is hard work. Times of physical labor , times of making logical and emotional connections. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is nine so this is the little Ive seen from the few long term unschooled teens Ive seen or read about. There will come a point where they will develop a passion and figure out how to make money off it ..... or volunteer work...and they will choose to miss out on other fun.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNicole <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry that children never listen to you : worry that they are always watching you--Robert Fulghum <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":291337950,"authorName":"almadoing","from":"&quot;almadoing&quot; &lt;almadoing@...&gt;","profile":"almadoing","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"The work ethic","postDate":"1224847574","msgId":36711,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdkc2JjbStqc2VrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":36715,"prevInTime":36710,"nextInTime":36712,"topicId":36711,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is something I ve been struggling with a bit recently.

I was <br/>\nraised to believe that hard work was good for the mind, body and soul, <br/>\nand that having fun had to be earned. Now if my unschooling aim is for <br/>\nmy kids to have fun I have to let go of that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t actually find it too hard irt my kids at ages 6 and 3, but I do <br/>\nworry I&#39;ll find it harder as they get older and I do find it a struggle <br/>\nfor myself. When I used to work outside the home I used to love that <br/>\nSaturday feeling of wearing PJs til lunch or watching tv all day or <br/>\nwhatever. Now, I just feel slovenly. And where will my kids get that <br/>\ndelicious feeling of a well-earned bit of fun from?<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to your thoughts and wisdom.<br/>\nAlison<br/>\nDH, DS1 (6) and DS2 (3)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36679,"nextTopicId":36760}}
