Let the Child Lead<br/>\nParents new to unschooling often feel overwhelmed by the               <br/>\nassumption that everything is in their hands. They believe that it               <br/>\nis up to them to choose the topics for each day. If that               <br/>\nassumption were true, most unschooling parents would burn out               <br/>\nquickly and send their children to school! Fortunately, the truth               <br/>\nis just the opposite. The best way to help a child learn is to let               <br/>\nhim have the reins - he will naturally know what is of most               <br/>\ninterest to him at every moment, and will make that clear to you.               <br/>\nAll the parent needs to do is to trust that the child knows best               <br/>\nwhat he is ready and eager to learn, and then help him to find               <br/>\nwhatever materials or information he needs. The best analogy is to               <br/>\na reference librarian, who waits until he knows what the library               <br/>\npatron is looking for, and then helps him to find it. No reference               <br/>\nlibrarian tells the patron what to learn. Relax and let the               child <br/>\ntake the lead. Once this truth is fully understood,               unschooling <br/>\nbecomes easy and joyous.<br/>\n----------<br/>\nI have a problem with this first one. Simon and Linnaea sometimes, much more <br/>\nthan they were younger, but still now, need input. Their experience with the <br/>\nworld is much less than mine and their knowledge of what is available is much <br/>\nless as well. It is and was my job to give them opportunities to explore unknown <br/>\nthings. It was and is my job to strew their path with interesting and engaging <br/>\nthings to explore. Starting with the idea that a child knows what to learn may <br/>\nkeep people from offering interesting things for children to do. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":83912605,"authorName":"naturalchildproject","from":"&quot;naturalchildproject&quot; &lt;jan@...&gt;","profile":"naturalchildproject","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Ten Tips for New Unschoolers","postDate":"1296923977","msgId":46075,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlpanVnOSt0bzk0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46076,"prevInTime":46074,"nextInTime":46076,"topicId":46075,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, I ve written an article for parents new to unschooling: Ten Tips for New Unschoolers ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-515757704\">Hi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve written an article for parents new to unschooling:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Ten Tips for New Unschoolers&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.org/jan_hunt/ten_tips_unschooling.html\">http://www.naturalchild.org/jan_hunt/ten_tips_unschooling.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also listed it in links/articles.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;ve left out any important points, please let me know - I may write a sequel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nJan<br/>\n<br/>\nJan Hunt, M.Sc., Director<br/>\nNatural Child Project<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.org\">http://www.naturalchild.org</a><br/>\nFollow me on Twitter: @janbaronhunt<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Unschooling Unmanual<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.org/unmanual\">http://www.naturalchild.org/unmanual</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Change the world - nurture a child.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46062,"nextTopicId":46086}}
