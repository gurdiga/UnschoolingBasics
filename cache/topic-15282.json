I think if a parent was expecting a kid to<br/>\ndo X and the kid didn&#39;t he&#39;d hear about it.  Since that&#39;s the way it is<br/>\nin most families that&#39;s what unschoolers caution against. <br/>\n<br/>\n***Although nobody on the planet agreed to be born or which<br/>\nparents to be born to &lt;snip&gt; so I dont really think that applies to<br/>\nareas of personal care<br/>\nor responsibility.***<br/>\n<br/>\nAdults have had time here, have experience and have reached the magical<br/>\nage of adulthood when they can enter into legally binding agreements.  An<br/>\nadult saying to another adult, &quot;yes, I&#39;ll live with you and share the<br/>\nresponsibility of  a home with you &quot; is not the same as a child being<br/>\nborn into a family where the adults have already made all the decisions<br/>\nabout the level of cleanliness and orderliness the house should have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAdults who agree to share responsibility do so (usually and hopefully&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\nwithout a huge difference in power between the agreeing parties.  Most of<br/>\nus did not get married out of fear of what the other person would do if<br/>\nwe said &quot;no.&quot;  Most of us did not agree to whatever standard of house<br/>\nkeeping our partner decided upon without some discussion or out of fear. <br/>\n I think that unless parents are very mindful, and even sometimes *when*<br/>\nparents are very mindful children understand where the authority is and<br/>\nfeel compelled to comply.     So I believe there is a difference.   We<br/>\naccept that children can&#39;t enter into legally binding agreements.  The<br/>\nreason there&#39;s a law is that children may be unduly influenced by a<br/>\nperson in a position of power and agree to something they would not have<br/>\nagreed to except under pressure or that they might not have enough<br/>\nexperience to know the agreement was not in their best interest.    <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I don&#39;t think bringing a child into an existing situation where the<br/>\nstandards for clean and orderly have already been set by someone bigger<br/>\nand more powerful is the same as two adults equal in the eyes of the law<br/>\ndeciding together to share the responsibility of a home. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t think you&#39;re talking about requiring chores.  You&#39;re saying<br/>\nexpecting kids to help isn&#39;t a bad thing.  I think it *can* be bad when<br/>\nthere is an &quot;or else.&quot;   And I think it&#39;s a very rare situation where a<br/>\nparent has an expectation of a kid and if the kid fails to meet that<br/>\nexpectation there is no repercussion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut more than that I&#39;m saying kids can learn to pick up after themselves<br/>\nand others and to be thoughtful without (what could be) the pressure of<br/>\nthe expectations of the parent.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy thoughts about Dylan were not that he &quot;should&quot; learn to pick up after<br/>\nhimself and be helpful.  My understanding was that he would see the value<br/>\nof such things and choose to do them.   I suspect you mean much the same<br/>\nthing. <br/>\n<br/>\n***For me, picking up after yourself isn&#39;t the same as helpfulness.  I am<br/>\nnot trying to &quot;teach&quot; my kids to be helpful by expecting them to put<br/>\ntheir<br/>\nstuff away now and then ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in a multi person household picking up after oneself is helpful.<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;   And I don&#39;t believe anyone can &quot;teach&quot; helpfulness.  We can model<br/>\nit and in doing so demonstrate the value of getting and giving help.  <br/>\nChildren who live where it is modeled understand the value and determine<br/>\nfor themselves it&#39;s worthwhile.   We can require a child to do things<br/>\nthat would be helpful to us but forcing a certain action is not the same<br/>\nas learning.  Children who are forced to be helpful don&#39;t necessarily<br/>\ninternalize the value of helpfulness.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I just don&#39;t<br/>\nreally consider picking up ones own stuff to be &quot;help&quot; though.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI would feel like Dylan was being helpful if he picked up his trains so I<br/>\ncould mop.  Or if he put his laundry away so I could have the laundry<br/>\nbasket.  When Dylan picks up his stuff that means I won&#39;t be picking it<br/>\nup and that&#39;s helpful to me if I&#39;m in a hurry or if I have a lot to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***It seems like<br/>\na natural gradual progression to get to that point unless it is stymied<br/>\nby<br/>\noutside forces.***<br/>\n<br/>\nRight.

As Dylan&#39;s mom I thought if resentment was the price<br/>\n&gt; of tidy, tidy was too expensive. &lt;g&gt;    But as I became a more mindful<br/>\n&gt; parent it became more about whether it was really Dylan&#39;s responsibility.<br/>\n&gt;   *I* was the one with the vision of &quot;tidy.&quot;   *I* was the one who&#39;d made<br/>\n&gt; the choices about furniture arrangement for the sake of *my* convenience.<br/>\n&gt;  David and I were the people who&#39;d decided we&#39;d live in house.

It wasn&#39;t his responsibility to meet my expectations for our<br/>\n&gt; home.   His expectations were very different.  He expected to have a<br/>\n&gt; happy day.  He expected to find his toys where he left them.  He expected<br/>\n&gt; to be able to play.   I believed that his expectations were just as valid<br/>\n&gt; as mine, and maybe more valid.  Mine seemed to be based on societal norms<br/>\n&gt; for standards of acceptable levels of tidy. &lt;g&gt;   (I got over that.<br/>\n&gt; )&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[***] I agree that kids don&#39;t have a responsibility to meet expectations for<br/>\na home, to care for a home or to do maintenance on a home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When I began to view his need for freedom to play and explore as equal to<br/>\n&gt; my need for a minimal level of tidy I found my happy place.  I could<br/>\n&gt; straighten up and clean without making him feel like he was in the way in<br/>\n&gt; his own home.  I accepted that he had as much right to have his stuff on<br/>\n&gt; the table and coffee table and floor as I did.  My stuff was rugs,<br/>\n&gt; pottery, candles, books, decorative doo-dads.   My stuff was pretty and<br/>\n&gt; made our home look nice.  My stuff still wasn&#39;t more important than his<br/>\n&gt; stuff.&lt;g&gt;  I wasn&#39;t more deserving of space for things than he was.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[***] I agree with this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would say, out loud, &quot;I&#39;m going to do the dishes so we have a nice<br/>\n&gt; clean kitchen.&quot;   or &quot;I&#39;m going to move your stuff for a minute to wash<br/>\n&gt; this table.&quot; Or, after dinner, &quot;Let me take your plate to the sink.&quot;  He<br/>\n&gt; saw the value in cleaning up.  He began to participate.  When he was very<br/>\n&gt; little, if he saw me wipe the table before dinner, he&#39;d go get a<br/>\n&gt; washcloth, sometimes dry, sometimes sopping wet, &lt;g&gt; and start wiping<br/>\n&gt; stuff: His toes, the cat, the floor, the chairs, my shoes. &lt;g&gt;  If he<br/>\n&gt; wanted to play at the coffee table he would often get a cloth and wipe it<br/>\n&gt; first.  After he was finished with food he&#39;d take his dishes to the sink.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know when I come downstairs in the morning  Dylan will have put his<br/>\n&gt; things away and taken his dishes to the sink.  I know he&#39;ll have locked<br/>\n&gt; the doors and turned out the lights.   It&#39;s not that I expect it in a &quot;do<br/>\n&gt; it or else&quot; kind of way but I know he&#39;s responsible.   If he didn&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt; one or all of those things I&#39;d know he had a good reason.  If the reason<br/>\n&gt; was that he was tired and forgot, that&#39;s a good reason.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[***] Yes I&#39;ve seen these same dynamics in my family.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For years Dylan has been responsible and helpful.  Part of that is his<br/>\n&gt; nature.  Part, I believe, is because we lived like this was his house as<br/>\n&gt; much as ours but we didn&#39;t force our expectations on him.  He had the<br/>\n&gt; freedom and time to learn that because it was his house too, he benefited<br/>\n&gt; from it being tidy.   He came to see this house as partly his<br/>\n&gt; responsibility and he has no resentment about cleaning and helping<br/>\n&gt; because he hasn&#39;t been held to someone else&#39;s expectation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[***] We&#39;ve always just had the assumption in our family that people as they<br/>\nget older gradually take on more personal responsibility for their bodies<br/>\nand their surroundings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are all responsible and helpful as well, in their own ways within<br/>\ntheir own personalities and ages.  For example, my 11 y.o. has a tendency to<br/>\nput his stuff everywhere around the house.  But on his way to bed he turns<br/>\nout all the lights, puts the cat away, turns off the lizard and toads day<br/>\nlights, and locks the doors.  Not because he&#39;ll be punished if he doesn&#39;t do<br/>\nit but because he enjoys doing it and feels like he&#39;s taking care of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nActual cleaning (not just stuff-picking-up) and yard care and house care is<br/>\nthe domain of the parents and/or whoever they want to pay imo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s the same with our animals.   The old dog is mine and was mine before<br/>\n&gt; I ever got David or Dylan.   The old cat, too.  The newer dog and cat and<br/>\n&gt; frogs and bird came later but the decision was mine.   I am the one who<br/>\n&gt; is home most of the time, I&#39;m the one who pays for food and vet bills.<br/>\n&gt; Dylan could not bring a critter into the house unless I agreed.   He<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t have a steady income that would pay for vet bills and food.  He&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; need the approval of the people who&#39;d be paying for that.   So the<br/>\n&gt; responsibility for critter care is on me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And just like with housework, as I took care of animals I&#39;d say &quot;You guys<br/>\n&gt; need fresh water.&quot;  And, &quot;Oh, no! Your bowl is empty!&quot;  And &quot;MAN! There<br/>\n&gt; are dog bombs all over the yard, it&#39;s time to scoop!&quot;     Dylan became<br/>\n&gt; aware of the level of care critters needed.  He loves the animals and was<br/>\n&gt; happy to contribute to their care.  I&#39;m sure I could have ruined his<br/>\n&gt; willingness to be patient with or to clean up after our old dog now if I<br/>\n&gt; had expected him to be responsible for the animals when he was younger.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Expected&quot; in the &quot;or else,&quot; kind of way, I mean.  Or else he&#39;d get<br/>\n&gt; yelled at, or else he&#39;d be shamed, or else he&#39;d be punished, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All along though, I have been able to ask for help.   I was able to ask<br/>\n&gt; for and get help from my five year old when I wanted it and it&#39;s the same<br/>\n&gt; with my teenager.   He has helped happily when I&#39;ve asked and he helps<br/>\n&gt; when I don&#39;t ask.   Again, that&#39;s partly his nature, but I believe it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; partly due to the freedom he&#39;s had to learn the value of helping.   I<br/>\n&gt; think of expecting a child to do chores the same way I think of requiring<br/>\n&gt; a child to do workbooks or drills.  It&#39;s not necessary.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; necessarily contribute to the learning most adults think it will and it<br/>\n&gt; can cause stress in the relationship.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[***] Yes, I think we blew it with my 15 y.o. on this one.  He *really*<br/>\nwanted a dog and we told him he would have to help take care of it (this was<br/>\nwhen he was like 7).  Here he is 15, and still having to take care of the<br/>\ndog plus another one we added later.  He has help for it, but his dad will<br/>\nsometimes make him do it when he doesn&#39;t want to.  This is obviously not an<br/>\nideal pet care situation.  I should be taking more responsibility for that.<br/>\nOn the other hand, the cat care has been my 11 y.o.s responsibility and he<br/>\njust handles it.  Sometime he needs a reminder but mostly he just does it.<br/>\nHe also, as I mentioned earlier, turns the lizard and toad light off at<br/>\nnight and on in the morning, although feeding crickets and cleaning cages is<br/>\nusually my domain.<br/>\n<br/>\nPets is a hard one for me.  I feel uncomfortable with the kids *knowing*<br/>\n(for example) that the dogs are hungry, but preferring to sit down and eat<br/>\nthemselves, or go to bed, without feeding the dogs.  Modeling the attitude<br/>\nof caring for animals and then self would obviously work better than saying,<br/>\n&quot;Feed the critters before you eat!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If unschoolers can trust a child will learn math concepts and reading and<br/>\n&gt; writing they can trust a child will learn helpfulness.   And just like<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers are prepared to accept later reading by a child if the child<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t ready to read at eight or nine or ten, they should be prepared to<br/>\n&gt; accept the helpfulness to come at exactly the time the child is ready.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s hard for parents as they tend to think they &quot;deserve&quot; help when<br/>\n&gt; *they* are ready for it.   But helpfulness is a gift and we don&#39;t demand<br/>\n&gt; gifts from gift givers.  We don&#39;t sit around waiting for gifts to be<br/>\n&gt; bestowed upon us.  We give the gifts we have; time, patience, freedom,<br/>\n&gt; helpfulness and when that beautiful thing blossoms from our gift giving<br/>\n&gt; we just sit back in awe of the amazing nature of our kids.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Deb Lewis<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[***] For me, picking up after yourself isn&#39;t the same as helpfulness.  I am<br/>\nnot trying to &quot;teach&quot; my kids to be helpful by expecting them to put their<br/>\nstuff away now and then (not stuff they&#39;re using; stuff they used three days<br/>\nago and is still laying out, for example).  Instead I am just expecting them<br/>\nto gradually gain more responsibility for their bodies and their<br/>\nsurroundings.  Stuff gets broken when it lays around.  Happens often around<br/>\nhere, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I &quot;deserve&quot; help.  I enjoy help when it comes. I just don&#39;t<br/>\nreally consider picking up ones own stuff to be &quot;help&quot; though.  It&#39;s just<br/>\npart of growing up and maturing.  When they&#39;re little they need help with<br/>\n*everything* - butt wiping, tooth brushing, feeding, dressing, etc. etc.<br/>\nWhen they move out (ideally) they are ready for the world - personal care<br/>\nand personal surroundings care, and able to care for others.  It seems like<br/>\na natural gradual progression to get to that point unless it is stymied by<br/>\noutside forces.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Q~<br/>\naka Sarah<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unbridledlearning.com\">http://www.unbridledlearning.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>\nVersion: 7.1.394 / Virus Database: 268.9.8/381 - Release Date: 7/3/2006</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"Deb Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Rules vs. Expectations","postDate":"1151940971","msgId":15282,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNzAzLjA5MzYxMS4yOTc2LjAuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15291,"prevInTime":15281,"nextInTime":15283,"topicId":15282,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I expect them to treat each other and their parents respectfully.

So I expect him to be faithful<br/>\nin our marriage.  I expect him to provide an income.  I expect him to be<br/>\nkind to his family.  And if he can&#39;t do those things or if he changes his<br/>\nmind I expect him to tell me.  There is an &quot;or else&quot; to the failure to<br/>\nmeet those expectations. &lt;g&gt;  If he&#39;s unfaithful he&#39;ll lose my trust and<br/>\nmaybe be divorced.  If he can&#39;t work he&#39;ll have to change the standard of<br/>\nliving he&#39;s accustomed to.  If he&#39;s not kind to us he&#39;ll have to change<br/>\nthat or he&#39;ll be asked to leave.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut Dylan didn&#39;t make any agreements with us upon his conception and<br/>\nbirth.  We didn&#39;t give him a choice.  We just made him and then kept him.<br/>\n  He didn&#39;t get to listen to our terms and agree or decline.   He didn&#39;t<br/>\nget to present us with his terms.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI never expected Dylan to help keep the house straightened up for a<br/>\ncouple of reasons.   Initially it was because as a child I had to help<br/>\nand I resented it.  As Dylan&#39;s mom I thought if resentment was the price<br/>\nof tidy, tidy was too expensive. &lt;g&gt;    But as I became a more mindful<br/>\nparent it became more about whether it was really Dylan&#39;s responsibility.<br/>\n  *I* was the one with the vision of &quot;tidy.&quot;   *I* was the one who&#39;d made<br/>\nthe choices about furniture arrangement for the sake of *my* convenience.<br/>\n David and I were the people who&#39;d decided we&#39;d live in house.   We were<br/>\npaying the mortgage.  We&#39;d decided it was worth it.  None of that was up<br/>\nto Dylan.    It wasn&#39;t his responsibility to meet my expectations for our<br/>\nhome.

I accepted that he had as much right to have his stuff on<br/>\nthe table and coffee table and floor as I did.  My stuff was rugs,<br/>\npottery, candles, books, decorative doo-dads.   My stuff was pretty and<br/>\nmade our home look nice.
