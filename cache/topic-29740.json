When I wrote my original post, he <br/>\nwas a shift supervisor - there is no chance for shifting hours in <br/>\nthat position.  The very next day after I wrote the post he found out <br/>\nhe was being moved to quality control.  He should be starting his day <br/>\na little later now.<br/>\n<br/>\n***maybe not schedule many &quot;events&quot; for those days (move the guitar <br/>\nlessons to a different day for instance) so that he can have more <br/>\ngeneral time with everyone?****<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for this big eye opener.  I realized I was over-scheduling <br/>\nsaturdays.  This is his one day to do what he wants, and I tend to <br/>\nplan some big family thing on this day.  He either has to do what I <br/>\npick or get left at home alone.  He really wants to use the first <br/>\nhalf of the day to do things around the house, and the second half to <br/>\ndo fun stuff with the family (not something I prescheduled without <br/>\nasking him).  So, today I threw out the museum trip I had planned, <br/>\nlet him sleep in as late as he wanted, helped him when he asked for <br/>\nit, and respected the choices he made about how to spend his time.  <br/>\nFunny - he just wants to be treated the same as the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n***-Does he get vacation time he can use &#39;creatively&#39;? For instance, <br/>\nthis year, instead of one big vacation, I&#39;m going to take most of my <br/>\nvacation time as one or two day bits to make 3 or 4 day weekends. <br/>\nThat way we can have fun some way almost every month (any months that <br/>\ndon&#39;t have a built in Monday holiday get a vacation <br/>\nday &#39;holiday&#39;).*** <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a great idea.  He&#39;s already scheduled vacation for the L&L <br/>\nconference, and the mill tends to shut down around major holidays.  <br/>\nHe has several other vacation days just waiting to be used.  He could <br/>\nschedule these days randomly throughout the year as days to do <br/>\nwhatever he wants to do.  He really doesn&#39;t get to do what he wants <br/>\nto do very much.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for helping me get to the heart of the issue.  I am actually <br/>\ncausing the problem by not allowing my dh to make his own choices <br/>\nabout how to spend his days off from work.

Appreciating the<br/>\nsituation is important too - I know that it helps me feel better about<br/>\nbeing the WOH parent knowing that DH recognizes that my going to work<br/>\nallows for the lifestyle we all enjoy - it gets verbalized, not just<br/>\nassumed. Then, we talked about how he *can* get the things he wants, the<br/>\nthings he wished he had now and things he wishes he&#39;d had when he was a<br/>\nkid (the same kind of respect, autonomy, freedom, etc). Things to<br/>\ndiscuss might include:<br/>\n <br/>\n-Does he &quot;have to&quot; keep this job if the hours are causing problems? I<br/>\nknow changing jobs is not always readily available or easy but put it<br/>\nout on the table at least.

Maybe<br/>\nstart at 7:30 am instead of 5:30?<br/>\n-Does he get more time late in the day because he goes in so early (as<br/>\nin starting at 5:30 am means he&#39;s home by 3 in the afternoon)? <br/>\n-Does he work longer shifts/shorter week (four 10 hr shifts for<br/>\nexample)? If so, can you and the kids plan to include him more on his<br/>\noff days - maybe not schedule many &quot;events&quot; for those days (move the<br/>\nguitar lessons to a different day for instance) so that he can have more<br/>\ngeneral time with everyone?<br/>\n-Does he get vacation time he can use &#39;creatively&#39;? For instance, this<br/>\nyear, instead of one big vacation, I&#39;m going to take most of my vacation<br/>\ntime as one or two day bits to make 3 or 4 day weekends. That way we can<br/>\nhave fun some way almost every month (any months that don&#39;t have a built<br/>\nin Monday holiday get a vacation day &#39;holiday&#39;). I also (back when we<br/>\ndid field trips more often with a local hs group) would plan for one or<br/>\ntwo days per year to take off and go with them (the &#39;big&#39; trips like the<br/>\nBronx Zoo).<br/>\n-Are there ways you can communicate with him during the day to keep him<br/>\n&#39;in the loop&#39; at least? Some folks use private blogs so that the away<br/>\nfrom home parent can log in whenever they get a chance to see what&#39;s up.<br/>\nWe deliberately chose cell phones with decent cameras (even though<br/>\nslightly more expensive) so that when my guys are out and about, they<br/>\ncan message me with pictures of things that are fun - snakes and lizards<br/>\nin the backyard, the submarine they visited on a field trip to the naval<br/>\nsub base/submarine museum, neat waterfalls on local hiking trails, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you discuss things with your DH, maybe have a family meeting to get<br/>\ncreative with it - if his biggest concern is not being connected to the<br/>\nstuff you&#39;re doing, discuss ways to include him  - whether it&#39;s lots of<br/>\nphotos, a blog, phone calls (I usually call/get called at least twice<br/>\nper day when I&#39;m at work), creatively scheduling the &#39;fun&#39; stuff so that<br/>\nDH can participate some of the time, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
