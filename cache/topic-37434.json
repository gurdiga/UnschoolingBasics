Ds will sometimes fall asleep at 7pm then be back up at 4 am. If I stay up really late then Im really worn out and cranky all day after getting up at 4. dd5 is usualy out no later than 9 on school nights because she has to get up early the next day and has adjusted her schedule to it. dd9 however will stay up till 3 am and sleep in till 10 or 11. <br/>\n<br/>\nso dh usualy after dinner dh takes ds while I help dd5 get a bath and get relaxed and dd9 usualy hangs out with dh and ds or snatches my computer for a while . <br/>\nThen either ds will have already fallen asleep while we are bahing or dh will take him on our bed and start laying down with him. I usualy lay down on with dd5 while she falls asleep . Dd9 is either still with dad and brother or is playing quietly in the room with us . I will often fall asleep between 8 and 9 with dd5 . Dh will carry ds to his bed then I go to our room. Sometimes around midnight Im back up for an hour because I enjoy a little quiet time to myself or with Courtney and sometimes I sleep all night. <br/>\nI sometimes feel bad that dd9 is up by herself for so ling but 1.

What I mean is that there are fewer <br/>\ndisciplines, fewer rules or mandatory commitments (say to piano for 1 <br/>\nyear or swimming lessons, etc - if the child becomes disinterested, <br/>\nthere is a philosophy to discontinue that route).  Fewer mandatory <br/>\nbedtime rituals, forced eating habits, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main question is &quot;Where did this idea of &#39;radical&#39; unschooling <br/>\nbegin and if the answer if basically from John Holt, could you point <br/>\nme in the direction of his writings that back this idea up??  I am <br/>\nreading much of John Holt&#39;s work and while I find it to support <br/>\neducational unschooling, I have yet to come across the lifestyle <br/>\nunschooling I describe.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think John Holt actually *said* or *wrote* that unschooling should leak into the rest of your life. But it was plain to *me*, in reading his books and articles and copies of Growing Without Schooling, that he truly believed children to be waaay more capable than adults gave them credit for. As a *child*, *I* knew I was waaay more capable than most adults gave me credit for!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that, if you read his last book, you will see how very radical his thinking was becoming. Yes, we may be reading more into it than he&#39;d planned, but my guess is that what we espouse here is only the tip of Holt&#39;s personal iceberg, had he lived=2<br/>\n0this long.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference is that we have children, have used his thought processes (and taken them further), and have seen---with our own eyes---what can happen when children are treated with respect and trust and dignity. Holt was kind of the instigator, but I feel that we have followed through. He gave us his hypothesis, but we&#39;re writing the dissertation. &lt;G&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI am intrigued by this and have considered it as an option when my <br/>\nchildren get a little bit older, but with a 1, 3, 5, and 8 year old, <br/>\nwe need a little more authority-type leading in our house or I feel <br/>\nthat it would be chaotic, at best. <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you saying my house is chaotic? OK, granted, I have two boys, 20 & 12; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbut I had a houseFULL of unschoolers last weekend---32 of them. No chaos. Quite peaceful, as a matter of fact.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one is saying &quot;You must do it this way.&quot; What we write on a regular basis is that we have seen the benefits---and they&#39;re amazing. But you should never do anything that *you* don&#39;t think is right. I have friends who are/were dictators. It works for them. Of course, their children are now grown and visit very rarely and have not very nice things to say about their parents---but it worked for the parents. I have bigger goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI already am very unstructured, <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nchild-led educationally.  I buy into &quot;Better Late than Early&quot; <br/>\nconcepts and the idea that a child will really only learn with <br/>\nr<br/>\netention if they are interested or passionate about something.  We <br/>\nconsider anything we &quot;have&quot; to do that we aren&#39;t interested in to <br/>\nbe &quot;hoop-jumping&quot;.  (Evaluations, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\n--=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet swimming lessons and piano lessons seem important to you. They are &quot;hoops&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n--=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, as I stated, this is not a judgement because I am looking at <br/>\nthis as a possible future way of living, but need a little more in <br/>\nthe resource department to really see that it works. <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI can guarantee that it will be harder to implement the longer you wait. The younger your children *are*, the less damage you have to undo. It&#39;s that simple. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI canNOT recommend enough the idea of attending an unschooling conference. You will be able to see teens who have been treated with trust and respect----there&#39;s NOTHING like it! You can see them interact with each other, with their parents, with grandparents, and with younger children and babies. THAT&#39;s the proof you need. Seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Furthermore, I <br/>\nhave very unsupportive parents about the unschooling process, both <br/>\neducationally and lifestyle ways.

I will really look at it and see how <br/>\nI can change some of the things we do to be more trusting of the <br/>\nchildren. <br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, I think I, personally, am very trusting of my children, <br/>\nespecially when it comes to the things most people get worried about -<br/>\nreading and math.  My 8 yo reads on a upper 1st grade level (if <br/>\nsomeone were to compare him) but I think that is just fine - it is <br/>\nhis level, he taught himself to read mostly and he enjoys being read <br/>\nto.  He has expressed an interest in learning to spell because he <br/>\ncan&#39;t spell much and we have looked into some ways for him to improve <br/>\nhis spelling.  Some days, when he is interested, I work with him on <br/>\nwriting letters to friends or relatives.  It is laborious, but it is <br/>\nwhat he has asked for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the big issue with the &quot;rules&quot; of the household is my <br/>\nhusband.  He wants the kids in bed at a certain time (all three boys <br/>\nshare one room) and demands they listen to him because he is <br/>\nthe &quot;authority&quot; and what he says goes.  I know that he gets this type <br/>\nof parenting from his parents.  My parents were VERY trusting and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t give me any rules or curfews, etc.  It worked for me, but not <br/>\nfor my sister - who was constantly doing the wrong things (drinking, <br/>\nstaying out until 3 am, skipping school).  I am trying to role model <br/>\nthe idea of peaceful parenting, trusting my kids with non-academic <br/>\nthings (my husband is almost completely on board now with unschooling <br/>\neducationally).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my thoughts are that right now the timing for our family - me <br/>\nAND my husband - are not ideal for me to push for an unschooling <br/>\nlifestyle beyond education.  Since this is my goal as a destination, <br/>\nI am looking for ways to ease into this style of living while not <br/>\nbombarding my husband with a list of demands as to how we need to <br/>\nchange our lives NOW.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is chaotic at our house as it is with four young children any way <br/>\nyou look at it.  I appreciate the posts and look forward to <br/>\nresearching this further.  I believe that my journey with unschooling <br/>\nhas just begun and can only get better.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, BRIAN POLIKOWSKY <br/>\n&lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is a collection of quotes from Holt:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/holt/quotes\">http://sandradodd.com/holt/quotes</a><br/>\n&gt; most are not compatible wit an authoritary parenting home.<br/>\n&gt; But my question for you is:<br/>\n&gt; What is authoritary parenting to you?<br/>\n&gt; Why do you think you could not unschool &quot;radicaly&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; Why do you think your home would be chaotic?<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling is about trusting your chld to learn what she needs, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>wants when she is ready.

Because there CAN be unschooling in a family where kids also have chores and bedtimes and have to clean their plates. I don&#39;t personally think it will have the depth or benefit, ultimately, as a house where the children&#39;s preferences and freedoms have high priority, but it could still absolutely be, in homeschooling terms, unschooling. <br/>\nI think this is a good point, and something I had been wondering about. We have unschooled for the past five years. My children had no assigned academic work; no TV, computer, or video game rules; and in general did what they wanted to when they wanted to. But they did have chores, and they did have regular meal and snack times and no food in between, and they did have bedtimes. <br/>\nOn the other hand, after being on this list for only a few days, I started to get the point of doing away with bedtimes, food control, and chores. I saw the whole picture and respect my children a lot more because of it. We no longer have assigned chores and surprise, surprise, my children often are willing to help out anyways. We no longer have any food controls, and I ask my children what they would like before I go to the grocery store, and believe it or not, I think they eat healthier than before. We no longer have bedtimes, and the kids do stay up a lot later than they used to, and they&#39;re sometimes too noisy even when I tell them that I&#39;m trying to rest, but this is still new to them, and I think they&#39;ll settle down after a while when they trust the situation more. <br/>\nI think it&#39;s great that all these topics were discussed on this list. This is a great place for other unschoolers like myself to see that there can be so much more to unschooling than just not doing formal academics. <br/>\nJacqueline (Ivorygrace7...)<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA mom on a discussion list had questions, and Robyn Coburn gave these inspiring answers: <br/>\nQ:I have been reading more on unschooling and I keep getting &quot;stuck&quot; on the whole no limitations or restrictions on food, tv, video games, computer time, bedtimes, participation in chores, etc. After reading some of the opinions/interpretations of other unschoolers I have become almost leary of using the term to describe what we do. So my question....are you an unschooler if you DO have guidelines on these issues????? <br/>\nTechnically, Unschooling is simply &quot;not doing school&quot; - trusting that your children will learn all they need from living a life of engaging in their interests. <br/>\nIf you don&#39;t want to Radically or Whole Life Unschool, then don&#39;t - no one is going to send the goon squad over to your house to insist that you drop all restrictions, or even that you ease your restrictions gently. However, we might suggest this as a way to greater joy and partnership with your children, instead of continuing to live in an adversarial manner with them, even if it is only mildly adversarial. <br/>\nI would encourage you to do more reading about living by Principles instead of rules, and especially to read at www.sandradodd.com/unschooling and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a> <br/>\nOne major foundation of Unschooling is the Principle of Trust. Unschooling will never be as sparkling and joyful and transcendently brilliant while you are only prepared to trust your children as long as they are making the same choices that you would make on their behalf. What you are then depriving them and yourself of are the startlingly brilliant, extraordinary, more creative choices that they would make for themselves, when they are able to be the fully autonomous arbiters of their own learning and managers of their own time. <br/>\nWhilever you are the person deciding which of their needs or interests is worthy of fulfilling, you are depriving them of the opportunity to fully know themselves. Q:We do alot of things together as a family because it&#39;s just what we do...we don&#39;t offer them the choice to not participate with family/household responsibilites - it&#39;s not really questioned, it&#39;s just what we do. <br/>\nBy relinquishing the desire to control, you help your child onto the path of living mindfully themselves, making choices and decisions mindfully and deliberately, instead of reactively. <br/>\nHow would you react if the lack of choice *were* to be questioned one day? Would your subsequent actions be likely to enhance or detract from your relationship with your children? <br/>\nYou are assuming that given the choice the children would never choose to help. The lists are full of stories of children spontaneously helping, doing unasked cleaning or tidying as gifts for their parents, doing *more* than the children with externally directed chores ever offer or do. Q:The tv does not stay on all day...I really haven&#39;t felt at this point like I have to RESTRICT their tv watching because there is typically something more interesting for them to do but it does go off after our rather late breakfasts. BUT if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was watch tv.....I would have a problem with that. (I can&#39;t really see that happening but...) <br/>\nIt happens here sometimes, and then it doesn&#39;t sometimes. I make no rules, give no directives, although I do remind her of other things that might be available in the smorgasbord of activities. My dd gets to choose what activities are of value *to her*. Sometimes that includes a lot of tv. Then she is done for a while. I Trust her to know her own desires. I verbally and physically appreciate her enthusiasm and joy in her chosen love of the moment. <br/>\nSwitch it around a bit with different words: <br/>\n&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was read books&quot;... <br/>\n&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was Dig in the garden&quot;.... <br/>\n&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was Play their violins&quot;... <br/>\n&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was Ride their horse&quot;... <br/>\n&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was Swim&quot;....The fact is that even if it is ALL they want to do for ALL day EVERY day, it will still be temporary; EVERY day would still not last forever. It would be a temporary need being fulfilled. Discovering and facilitating the children&#39;s passions is another tentpole of Unschooling practice. A child discovering something that they *want* every day is cause for celebration. <br/>\nThe only way to know if your children genuinely, truly want to do the other activities is if they have the option to choose not to do them. They can only choose to switch it off when they have the option to leave it on. Q:The girls don&#39;t choose when they go bed. We don&#39;t have a &quot;set&quot; bedtime...it flexes depending on what time they got up, what we&#39;re doing the next day and how early we have to get up and how everyone is acting and feeling. Ultimately though, when it&#39;s time...it&#39;s time. Once again, it&#39;s not typically questioned because they&#39;re tired and we have a nice routine that we follow and they share a bed/bedroom so they chit chat and do shadow puppets,etc. BUT if they decided that they wanted to stay up till 11 or 12 or later....well, I don&#39;t consider that an option for a 7 and 5 year old. <br/>\nCertainly there is no need to fix what isn&#39;t broken, or borrow trouble from a currently non-existent future scenario. <br/>\nHowever what I would encourage you to think about is just how arbitrary the times are that you mention. There is nothing magical about any particular hour on the clock, especially if the next day is fluid. Some children are naturally night owls, even when they are 7 and 5. Some are going to be early rising morning people for their entire lives. What is important is understanding and facilitating everyone&#39;s needs as much as is possible. At present it seems like everyone&#39;s needs are being met. Things can change, which is one reason why Principles work better in Unschooling, than rules or dictates. <br/>\nEvery time you feel the urge to control a choice, you can ask yourself &quot;why?&quot; and begin to question the assumptions (or fears) about children, parenting, learning and living joyfully that you are holding on to. <br/>\nIntentions matter. Guidance offered from the place of partnership and Trust has a different feeling, avoids rebellion, and is just plain less focused on the trivial. Guidance means optional acceptance instead of mandatory compliance. Guidance means parents being safety nets, not trap doors or examiners. Guidance facilitates mindfulness. Directives shut it down, and may even foster resentment instead. <br/>\nThe idea of Unschooling is for parents to be the facilitators of options, the openers of doors, the creators of environments of freedom, and the guardians of choice, not the installers of roadblocks and barriers. Unschoolers are making the huge and wonderful choice to renounce our legal entitlements to be the authoritarian controllers of our children&#39;s lives, and instead choose to be their partners. <br/>\nRobyn L.

What I mean is that there are fewer <br/>\ndisciplines, fewer rules or mandatory commitments (say to piano for 1 <br/>\nyear or swimming lessons, etc - if the child becomes disinterested, <br/>\nthere is a philosophy to discontinue that route).  Fewer mandatory <br/>\nbedtime rituals, forced eating habits, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main question is &quot;Where did this idea of &#39;radical&#39; unschooling <br/>\nbegin and if the answer if basically from John Holt, could you point <br/>\nme in the direction of his writings that back this idea up??  I am <br/>\nreading much of John Holt&#39;s work and while I find it to support <br/>\neducational unschooling, I have yet to come across the lifestyle <br/>\nunschooling I describe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am intrigued by this and have considered it as an option when my <br/>\nchildren get a little bit older, but with a 1, 3, 5, and 8 year old, <br/>\nwe need a little more authority-type leading in our house or I feel <br/>\nthat it would be chaotic, at best.  I already am very unstructured, <br/>\nchild-led educationally.  I buy into &quot;Better Late than Early&quot; <br/>\nconcepts and the idea that a child will really only learn with <br/>\nretention if they are interested or passionate about something.  We <br/>\nconsider anything we &quot;have&quot; to do that we aren&#39;t interested in to <br/>\nbe &quot;hoop-jumping&quot;.  (Evaluations, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, as I stated, this is not a judgement because I am looking at <br/>\nthis as a possible future way of living, but need a little more in <br/>\nthe resource department to really see that it works.  Furthermore, I <br/>\nhave very unsupportive parents about the unschooling process, both <br/>\neducationally and lifestyle ways.  I have learned to defend myself in <br/>\nsome areas, but any help you could provide would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance and hope everyone has a wonderful 2009!<br/>\nHeather</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37557,"nextTopicId":37549}}
