I have a friend in Canada, who is really interested in unschooling. <br/>\nHer kids are in school now, but she is done with the BS and is ready to try <br/>\nalternative methods. I am not sure how unschooly she will become, or wants to <br/>\nbecome, but I know she is very interested and has ordered The Teenage Liberation <br/>\nHandbook :) I asked her if I could help her find anyone near her - she has <br/>\njoined up with some Canadian yahoo groups for homeschooling, but is also <br/>\ninterested in knowing some people in person that unschool. Here is her info:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in Gatineau, Quebec,Â which is 2 minutes from the bridge into downtown <br/>\nOttawa, Ontario. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone knows anyone around tha area, that might be willing to meet up, or <br/>\ncould tell her of any unschooling in that area, that&#39;d be great. Thanks in <br/>\nadvance! <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************<br/>\nIdeas to please picky eaters.
