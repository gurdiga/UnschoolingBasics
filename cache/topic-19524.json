Our littlest boy will be 3 in March.  When he was 15 months even his pediatrician was very surprised that it looked like he was going to potty train, despite his age.  Then, from one day to the next, he had no interest in it whatsoever.  Lately, we&#39;ve tried to draw his interest back.  He likes to wear the underwear, but could care less about even trying to keep them clean and dry.  He loves to sit on the potty chair (not the toilet) but has never actually used it.  He used to tell us as soon as he messed his diaper (with either), but now he doesn&#39;t even seem to notice much less want to be changed.  We spent several days really putting focus on it then dropped it when it was obvious he just wasn&#39;t ready.  My oldest boy potty-trained at 2 from one day to the next.  Yes, I know they are all very different.  Yes, I know it will only happen when they are ready.  No, we are not pressuring him - we gave it a shot to see if he was interested and<br/>\n let it lie when he wasn&#39;t yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut....that hasn&#39;t kept me from wondering if we&#39;ve done something wrong.  That hasn&#39;t kept me from wondering why his interest changed so suddenly at 15 months or why he could now care less about the potty.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHEN I read on here an echo of his world:  This is a child who is demanding, at 2, that we spell things for him and write them down so he can see, demands to know what words say, has a vocabulary that is astounding... the typical things that escape this child&#39;s lips: &quot;Mom, are these actually your bracelets?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot;  (thinks) &quot;Hm..that&#39;s weird.&quot;  He also is a painting, coloring, drawing, cutting/pasting, tries-to-knit, dancing (as in self-choreographed!), singing fool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSO, I will quit worrying and realize I have an amazing child who is simply developing in many other astounding ways and will probably amaze me somehow or other when he is ready to potty train.
