My dd, who&#39;s <br/>\n11, has been thinking a lot lately about the meat she eats, mostly due <br/>\nto animal cruelty. She has always had an affinity for animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are some very knowdedgeable people here, and I am asking <br/>\nif anyone can recommend a website or two that offers good information <br/>\nwithout being too scare-mongering or too descriptive of animal <br/>\ncruelty.  For example, she loves chicken and eggs, and she wants to <br/>\nknow if the chickens are treated badly and if free-range really means <br/>\nwhat it says. <br/>\n<br/>\nI will also look myself, of course, but hey, I might miss some great <br/>\nsite that some of you already know!
