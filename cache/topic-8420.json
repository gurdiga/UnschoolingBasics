It seemed <br/>\nto have come at just the right time (driving home from a week visiting <br/>\nmy Mom) and I am really thankful for that one. Thank you , Ren, for <br/>\nthat. And Sandra, too, but I don&#39;t think she&#39;s on this list.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad it helped. It was a fun talk, but also kinda strange, seeing <br/>\nmy sister sitting in the front row crying every so often!!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&#39;s not on this list, but I&#39;ll forward the post to her, I know <br/>\nshe&#39;ll appreciate the comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8409,"nextTopicId":8412}}
