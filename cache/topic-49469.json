You could look those up or ask her. You could point out interesting tattoos on celebrities. If she likes movies you can look for tattoos on characters. You could ask her to design a tattoo for you and she could go with you when you get the work done. (If you like tattoos too, sometimes it’s genetic. &lt;g&gt; ) Visit tattoo places and look at designs and body jewelry.  Maybe she’d like to try henna? <br/>\n<br/>\n***Idk, I just don&#39;t feel comfortable w/her spend so much time on the computer***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLeaving school or school at home, living with grandma, those are big changes. If you have been or are stressed she might be feeling disconnected from you, too.  Be glad she has something that comforts and interests her.<br/>\n<br/>\n“...on the computer” sounds like one thing, but you’ve listed a lot of things she’s doing: Chatting with friends, role playing with friends, listening to music, watching videos, reading interviews, writing. In there somewhere she’s probably looking at tattoo designs and stumbling upon all kinds of interesting connections.  That’s a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you walk together just before bed, if she wants? Dylan and I used to walk late at night. It’s a wonderful time to talk. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you offer more outings to places that would interest her?  Offer but don’t insist.

Most of the time that passes within a few days as his sleep schedule turns. But, sometimes it goes longer. When it does, I might mention to him as we&#39;re snuggling in passing (so to speak) that I miss spending time with him and can we maybe plan to do something special (like a &#39;date&#39; to Starbucks - one of his fav places to hang out, we get a beverage and treat then play cribbage or scrabble or something that is portable like that - used to bring the battleship game along sometimes). He&#39;s usually quite willing to plan something for the near future and we both adjust our schedules to make it work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I would bet that the new extra time she&#39;s spending online is her way of dealing with the stress of living with grandma. I know that my hubby reacts to stress by retreating into videogames for a time. Once the stress recedes so does the extra time on gaming. If you&#39;re still deschooling PLUS have just moved AND have to live with grandma, that&#39;s a lot of stress for anyone, much less a child who has ZERO control over most of what has just happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebR<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

If you&#39;re disconnected from her music, from the bands she likes there&#39;s less for her to share with you when you do get together. Ask her about her best friends on line.

It can open the door to you sharing some of what you loved as a teen. Will she share her fan fiction with you? Don&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s romantic, perhaps even guy on guy romantic.

We began homeschooling mid-November. Dd has some issues that require medication, so in addition to deschooling, we are dealing with trying to stabilize that. The only thing she shows any interest in is the computer. I am lucky that she is actually interested in her online algebra program and Rosetta Stone German, but reading is out the window for the foreseeable future. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the online business, I try to focus on making sure she is being safe and try to let her follow her own interests. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I miss her! We are used to spending a great deal of time together.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My dd is also an only. I know how you feel! I think if you focus on making your time together enjoyable and do things you both like, they will be times she will look forward to. <br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t have a lot of answers, just wanted to let you know you are not the only one!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":382612893,"authorName":"regan","from":"regan &lt;regan@...&gt;","profile":"reganzzzz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: I need some insight & assurance","postDate":"1359329239","msgId":49470,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4RDEwQzA5LUYwRTMtNEM3OC1CNTE1LTE2Mzg2MzM5MTcyRUBzbG93Z2xvd2luZy5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGtlM3VpcisyYWZ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtlM3VpcisyYWZ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49469,"nextInTopic":49471,"prevInTime":49469,"nextInTime":49471,"topicId":49469,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Tina, I m interested in what others will write, others who have children your daughter s age and older, but I m moved to write because your daughter sounds","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-613080486\">Hi Tina,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m interested in what others will write, others who have children your daughter&#39;s age and older, but I&#39;m moved to write because your daughter sounds so much like ME!<br/>\nBeware, I am projecting�<br/>\n<br/>\nMy time was before the computer age, so I spent my free time writing long penpal letters to my distant friends (I had 100 penpals at one point), and trading magazine clippings with each other about our favorite bands.  I would watch MTV for hours trying to catch the short interviews they&#39;d intersperse with the videos, so that I could record them and rewatch them.  The penpal network would unearth old demo tapes and pass them around in the mail.  We&#39;d import magazines from England (at like $15 per magazine) so that we could access other photos and interviews.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI felt very far away from this world of culture I was so interested in.  I felt firmly entrenched in fandom, and didn&#39;t know that crossing over to being one of the artists was just a dream away.  When I became an adult, I was shocked to discover that there was a *local* music scene that matched the one I was supporting from overseas.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your daughter&#39;s place, this is some of what I would have wanted:<br/>\n- to visit local recording studios and see musicians at work<br/>\n- to design my own tattoos and have them made into temporary tattoos (did you know, this costs about $30?)<br/>\n- to have a decent camera and an understanding of mixed-lighting conditions, and attend all-ages concerts for the subculture of music I was interested in, and take photos of the bands<br/>\n- to have access to an instrument and recording software so that I could experiment with writing music myself<br/>\n- to have great drawing supplies and books on drawing and graphic arts<br/>\n- to have great photo books about tattoos<br/>\n- to learn about jewelry making.  art clay silver in particular!  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beadwares.com/class.shtml\">http://beadwares.com/class.shtml</a><br/>\n- to watch music documentaries about other musicians in the same subculture I was already into -- love learning how other creatives found their way to the public eye<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I hope some of these thoughts are good conversation fodder for you and your daughter.  For me, it was fun to imagine a do-over, everything that I would have tried so much sooner!<br/>\n<br/>\nall my best,<br/>\nRegan in NYC (my son is 3.75)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 27, 2013, at 2:18 PM, &quot;Tina M&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tmcadams81670@...\">tmcadams81670@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello all!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My dd is spending 10-12 hours a day on the computer.

I have been straight forward with my Mom about discipline & what my dd does and does not do. Maybe this is what is making me so nervous about her time spent on the computer. I miss her! We don&#39;t take our daily walk, and the only time we get time together is when we are going to bed together. She does see her bestie once a week, but b/c she lives 30 miles from us, so we only get to see her once a week. We go to the Library almost everyday, but while there she often hops on the computer. We don&#39;t have enough unschooling friends for support. I should also mention that we are smack dab in the middle of deschooling.
