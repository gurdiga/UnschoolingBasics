Thank you so much for taking the time to share your inspirational story on single parent unschooling.  Your post made my day and it is so great to hear it from someone on personal level.  Stories like yours keep me going.  I am a newly single mother so your situation definitely helps ease my mind on any of the doubts I&#39;ve had for being able to unschool as a single parent.  Unschooling is something that I&#39;ve kind of already been practicing with my son, but didn&#39;t know there was a name for it.  So unschooling when he&#39;s school age would just sort of flow naturally.  I am looking at my situation now and I feel that it is very possible to continue unschooling when my son is of school age.  What you shared has definitely helped me to see further than my own thoughts on unschooling and attachment parenting.

I don&#39;t know your situation, but I am a single (sole) parent. Reading the posts from unschooling parents with reluctant parents, I think the pro in mine is that I make my own decisions and do not have to really consult or convince anyone. My parents were initially concerned but I don&#39;t live with them, so I don&#39;t have everyday issues with them. <br/>\n <br/>\nThank you for posting this question. It gave me an opportunity think about it in detail.  For me, the key issues are:<br/>\n <br/>\n1. Financial Responsibility: considering that I cannot rely on anyone else (technically I can go to my parents, but) for financial support, I think it is important to address this. Not that it is a hurdle, but one does have to be creative in both finding appropriate earning opportunities and letting go of a few opportunities that may be very exciting. In my case, my job (I am a professor in a research school) requires only around ten to fifteen hours of face time at work. So as long as I can manage this job well and keep it, my financial concerns are not huge. And I decline many lucrative consulting opportunities so I don&#39;t spend any more time than absolutely necessary away from my son. I also know that there are many other single parents who are homeschooling their children making those choices.  Compred to families in our income levels, we also live frugally. I consciously chose a smaller house so my mortgage and utilities do not break me. I<br/>\nspend on stuff that he needs but skimp on things that he is not majorly into (clothes etc.) I spend a little bit on professional wardrobe but almost none on social clothes, etc. Any big expense, I try to save up rather than run a debt.<br/>\n <br/>\n2. Finding good caretakers: I think if you have to end up working outside the house, this is a key issue. I have been fortunate to draw on my ethnic and homeschooling networks for this. Currently, I have a local homeschooling teenager taking care of my son. I picked someone who is fun and can drive because it makes my life easier and my son&#39;s days more varied and interesting. She is able to drive him to beaches, parks, playgrounds etc.More importantly, I make sure that I find someone who my son connects well with.<br/>\n <br/>\n3. Support Networks: I have found this to be an important issue too. However, for this, I have had to be open minded in building support where I can. I would love to be embedded in an unschooler&#39;s network, but I live in a region where we are the &#39;only&#39; unschoolers. But over time, I have created good, solid relationships with local &#39;at home schoolers&#39; who are ever willing to support me and my son. In some ways, I am much closer to them than &#39;friends from work&#39;  etc. I have also needed to build similar trusting adult relationships for my son because I don&#39;t think it is a healthy situation if I am to be the only adult he can rely on or talk to.<br/>\n <br/>\n4. Lack of Personal Time: I am sure it is the case for any homeschooling parent, but if you are single, I think it is compounded. You don&#39;t have a spouse to pick up the slack. As is it is, I am away from my son a few hours a week and this means, I work a lot of hours every night on my research, teaching preparation etc. On top of it, I am neither inclined to pay for babysitting nor being away from him (even if I am willing to pay), for times when it is not absolutely necessary. This means that I have absolutely no time on my own when I am not working. So, I find little oases whenever possible. Some nights, I may take a break from work by watching a movie on my computer (Netflix is wonderful). I almost always try to wake up before him so I can get half an hour or so of quiet time with my coffee. What gets me down occasionally is that sometimes my life can get in a rut, because I don&#39;t have much time to pursue what may add a little spice and variety to<br/>\nmy life. We do a lot of things together: hiking, skiing, walking etc. I also live in a beautiful place and so sometimes, I find that taking a drive with him listening to his own stuff on his walkman and me listening to my music relaxes me, connects me with nature (even as I burn precious oil) and gives me that bubble of &#39;me&#39; time. <br/>\n <br/>\n5. Housework: I am sure that this is the same for all homeschoolers. I am a lot more comfortable with the house being in a mess. As long as it is clean enough to be healthy, I don&#39;t obsess about clearing all surfaces and keeping everything organized all the time. I grew up with servants and so I am used to everything being just so and letting go in this area took me a little bit of time. But I was frazzled all the time, because I was always working. Ofcourse, planning and organizing almost every space with bins helped in picking up stuff a lot. I don&#39;t usually expect my son to pick up etc. but I enlist his help in areas that he likes to do: for ex. cleaning windows and glass doors to the deck. He loves to do it. Similarly, he loves to rake and so I take his help in that. But, we have very long winters, so we don&#39;t have many months of outside chores. I hire help where I need and can afford - like snowremoval etc. We will not be take our car out if our<br/>\ndriveway is not shovelled everyday, perhaps even more than once some days. So it is money wellspent!<br/>\n <br/>\n6. Singleparent- single child companionship: I don&#39;t know if it is just a single parent thing or single child thing, but it definitely gets compounded in our configuration. My son is quite social (although not a major extrovert) and so there are times when there is so much energy I can put in being a companion to him. So, cultivating relationships with neighbors who have kids who may be in school etc. has helped in building a social life for him in the weekends etc. And I really constantly look for interesting things that both of us can do together. <br/>\n <br/>\n7. Avoiding negative thoughts: Because I am a single parent, I know I need to think about what will happen if something happens to me. I took out a decent insurance, talked to my sister and close friends about being potential guardians, executors, drew a will and decided to forget about it. I also try to keep these people closely informed about my parenting choices, Viyan&#39;s interests and growth so they will know him reasonably intimately should something happen. I also make sure that he stays in touch with his cousins in India, building a longer term family network for him.<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope this is helpful.

Reading the posts from","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-50662733\">Hi Theresa,<br/>\n <br/>\nI am a single parent homeschooling my 7 year old boy. I don&#39;t know your situation, but I am a single (sole) parent. Reading the posts from unschooling parents with reluctant parents, I think the pro in mine is that I make my own decisions and do not have to really consult or convince anyone. My parents were initially concerned but I don&#39;t live with them, so I don&#39;t have everyday issues with them. <br/>\n <br/>\nThank you for posting this question. It gave me an opportunity think about it in detail.  For me, the key issues are:<br/>\n <br/>\n1. Financial Responsibility: considering that I cannot rely on anyone else (technically I can go to my parents, but) for financial support, I think it is important to address this. Not that it is a hurdle, but one does have to be creative in both finding appropriate earning opportunities and letting go of a few opportunities that may be very exciting. In my case, my job (I am a professor in a research school) requires only around ten to fifteen hours of face time at work. So as long as I can manage this job well and keep it, my financial concerns are not huge. And I decline many lucrative consulting opportunities so I don&#39;t spend any more time than absolutely necessary away from my son. I also know that there are many other single parents who are homeschooling their children making those choices.  Compred to families in our income levels, we also live frugally. I consciously chose a smaller house so my mortgage and utilities do not break me. I<br/>\n spend on stuff that he needs but skimp on things that he is not majorly into (clothes etc.) I spend a little bit on professional wardrobe but almost none on social clothes, etc. Any big expense, I try to save up rather than run a debt.<br/>\n <br/>\n2. Finding good caretakers: I think if you have to end up working outside the house, this is a key issue. I have been fortunate to draw on my ethnic and homeschooling networks for this. Currently, I have a local homeschooling teenager taking care of my son. I picked someone who is fun and can drive because it makes my life easier and my son&#39;s days more varied and interesting. She is able to drive him to beaches, parks, playgrounds etc.More importantly, I make sure that I find someone who my son connects well with.<br/>\n <br/>\n3. Support Networks: I have found this to be an important issue too. However, for this, I have had to be open minded in building support where I can. I would love to be embedded in an unschooler&#39;s network, but I live in a region where we are the &#39;only&#39; unschoolers. But over time, I have created good, solid relationships with local &#39;at home schoolers&#39; who are ever willing to support me and my son. In some ways, I am much closer to them than &#39;friends from work&#39;  etc. I have also needed to build similar trusting adult relationships for my son because I don&#39;t think it is a healthy situation if I am to be the only adult he can rely on or talk to.<br/>\n <br/>\n4. Lack of Personal Time: I am sure it is the case for any homeschooling parent, but if you are single, I think it is compounded. You don&#39;t have a spouse to pick up the slack. As is it is, I am away from my son a few hours a week and this means, I work a lot of hours every night on my research, teaching preparation etc. On top of it, I am neither inclined to pay for babysitting nor being away from him (even if I am willing to pay), for times when it is not absolutely necessary. This means that I have absolutely no time on my own when I am not working. So, I find little oases whenever possible. Some nights, I may take a break from work by watching a movie on my computer (Netflix is wonderful). I almost always try to wake up before him so I can get half an hour or so of quiet time with my coffee. What gets me down occasionally is that sometimes my life can get in a rut, because I don&#39;t have much time to pursue what may add a little spice and variety to<br/>\n my life. We do a lot of things together: hiking, skiing, walking etc. I also live in a beautiful place and so sometimes, I find that taking a drive with him listening to his own stuff on his walkman and me listening to my music relaxes me, connects me with nature (even as I burn precious oil) and gives me that bubble of &#39;me&#39; time. <br/>\n <br/>\n5. Housework: I am sure that this is the same for all homeschoolers. I am a lot more comfortable with the house being in a mess. As long as it is clean enough to be healthy, I don&#39;t obsess about clearing all surfaces and keeping everything organized all the time. I grew up with servants and so I am used to everything being just so and letting go in this area took me a little bit of time. But I was frazzled all the time, because I was always working. Ofcourse, planning and organizing almost every space with bins helped in picking up stuff a lot. I don&#39;t usually expect my son to pick up etc. but I enlist his help in areas that he likes to do: for ex. cleaning windows and glass doors to the deck. He loves to do it. Similarly, he loves to rake and so I take his help in that. But, we have very long winters, so we don&#39;t have many months of outside chores. I hire help where I need and can afford - like snowremoval etc. We will not be take our car out if our<br/>\n driveway is not shovelled everyday, perhaps even more than once some days. So it is money wellspent!<br/>\n <br/>\n6. Singleparent-single child companionship: I don&#39;t know if it is just a single parent thing or single child thing, but it definitely gets compounded in our configuration. My son is quite social (although not a major extrovert) and so there are times when there is so much energy I can put in being a companion to him. So, cultivating relationships with neighbors who have kids who may be in school etc. has helped in building a social life for him in the weekends etc. And I really constantly look for interesting things that both of us can do together. <br/>\n <br/>\n7. Avoiding negative thoughts: Because I am a single parent, I know I need to think about what will happen if something happens to me. I took out a decent insurance, talked to my sister and close friends about being potential guardians, executors, drew a will and decided to forget about it. I also try to keep these people closely informed about my parenting choices, Viyan&#39;s interests and growth so they will know him reasonably intimately should something happen. I also make sure that he stays in touch with his cousins in India, building a longer term family network for him.<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope this is helpful. Please feel free to email me offlist if there is anything that I can help. I don&#39;t want to burden the list.<br/>\n <br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nLatha<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Sun, 9/20/09, tvgailo &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tvgailo@...\">tvgailo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: tvgailo &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tvgailo@...\">tvgailo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Reposting- Single Mama Wanting to Unschool<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Sunday, September 20, 2009, 4:30 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello Everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m Theresa and I have one 16 month old boy.
