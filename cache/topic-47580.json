With little kids, explaining won&#39;t help, they can&#39;t Possibly see any perspective but their own, so its up to you to make them safe as kindly as you can, minimizing distress and &quot;nos&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as you can, find places where he can walk and run around, but at the same time look for ways to get him there that Don&#39;t involve walking. If he&#39;ll ride in a stroller or pram, that&#39;s a good idea - with toys or games or a movie on a laptop to keep him happy along the way. Bike/jogging strollers are especially nice since they&#39;re big and enclosed - he can cuddle up and nap until you get where you&#39;re going if he likes. If there&#39;s any way to add a car to your life, now&#39;s a good time! Look at car-sharing and getting rides from friends as possible options in that regard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternately - or maybe in addition - go out less. Keep his perambulations to the corridors and stairs of your building or complex. He needs to Move and he needs to do that in safety and he can&#39;t provide his own safety right now. He depends on you for that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Ds seems fascinated by cars: he goes to the parked ones to touch them or to crawl under them<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could help to find a friend with a car so he can crawl over and through one to his heart&#39;s content. Or look for children&#39;s parks and museums with &quot;cars&quot; for him to play in and on. At home, be sure to provide him with lots of things to climb on and over - rearrange furniture and drape lots of cloths, build pillow forts and tunnels and have treasure hunts that include crawling under and through things.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the street, if you can&#39;t avoid walking, distract him as much as you possibly can. Be More interesting and engaging than the environment. Hold hands and run with him. Maybe toss a small object ahead and race to it with him. Don&#39;t just carry him, give him piggy-back rides while making animal sounds, silly-walk with him, go in costume and play-act with him. Don&#39;t walk anywhere without making it a big, engaging production which will keep him more interested in the fun he&#39;s having than the rest of the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd still expect him to periodically try to do things which aren&#39;t the least bit safe, to have to carry him screaming out of the road some of the time. Maybe a lot of the time for a couple years.

I do it when I remember. I remind my boys when I think of it. They sometimes do it on their own but mostly forget too. If I&#39;m in there wiping someone&#39;s butt, we always both wash our hands but that&#39;s as consistent as it gets. I really don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get seriously ill (beyond maybe a cold) by not washing hands. However, if there is already sickness (flu type, stomach virus, etc), it&#39;s probably prudent to be more conscientious.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I&#39;d focus on other things to keep people healthy. When my kids eat, they use a wet towel rather than a napkin because it helps with cleaning up their faces and hands if they&#39;ve gotten food on them and their hands have been in their mouths while eating. I periodically put powdered probiotics in my kids&#39; milk, especially during cold and flu season. I encourage them to sneeze or cough into the crook of their elbows rather than their hands. I wash off common surfaces like doorknobs and remote controls during cold and flu season too. We get flu shots, but I know some people aren&#39;t into that (my husband and I got ours today - I can&#39;t imagine having the flu while taking care of 3 kids).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an error where I prefer to manipulate the external circumstances rather than getting into a power struggle or being a nag. I, of course, inform them that some people think it&#39;s very important to wash their hands, especially after using the bathroom and I tell them why. I tell them that part of being a good guest or being a person other people are comfortable around can sometimes include making sure they are keeping up with their hygiene. I tell them some people are more bothered by dirt and germs than others. I don&#39;t want to send them out in the world having no clue where their actions (or inactions) put them on the spectrum of human behavior, <br/>\nparticularly in areas where we are more relaxed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know that most parents bug their kids about these types of things and it does nothing to help their relationship with their kids, nor does it give the kids the opportunity to make their own decisions about their own bodies. If a kid is doing (or not doing) something that will incontrovertibly harm someone else, it&#39;s a different issue. But slightly increasing the odds of sickness (that could probably be mitigated by controlling external factors with some effort on the parent&#39;s part, like I mentioned above) is not reason enough for me to override a kid&#39;s autonomy.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie M<br/>\nJames, Tyler and Audrey - 6, 4 and 2<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sacha Davis &lt;sacha@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks everyone.

I know, for instance, that my DS (now 13) doesn&#39;t like hand washing because he doesn&#39;t like the way his hands feel afterward (that still slightly damp clammy type feeling no matter how well you towel off). It gets in the way of other things he wants to do (drawing, videogames, etc). Also, I know that bar soap is difficult for him to manage so we have pump soaps of various sorts - a sudsy pump in one bathroom (liquid soap plus water creates a shaving cream like texture), a pump liquid soap in the other (apple cinnamon scent, none of us like soapy scents or florals). On occasions when HE feels a need to get clean hands (like after drippy ice cream cone) or I really have a need for his hands to be clean (like when he&#39;s helping me in the church nursery with toddlers), we&#39;ll discuss a good time to scrub his hands - often during a TV program that he&#39;s okay just watching, not doing anything else for a bit. Then I&#39;ll get a nice warm soapy SOFT wash cloth and I&#39;ll do the washing for him while he watches TV. Sometimes it&#39;s good old soap and water, sometimes it&#39;s hand sanitizer, sometimes it simply a wet wipe to remove sticky gunk. Germs, not so much. We do tend to do more hand washing when we&#39;re out and about (like AFTER being in the nursery with the toddlers) than if we&#39;re just around home - we&#39;re pretty much immune to each other and to the house and yard germs. It&#39;s the external &#39;bugs&#39; that might get us - one reason I wash my hands regularly here at work, all sorts of germs roaming on door handles and such that I do NOT want to bring home with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, I&#39;ve asked him to pick a time somewhere between this past Wednesday and next Friday morning to get shiny head to toe (shower, hair wash, hands clean, etc) because my parents are coming to visit for my birthday. I know my mom will want to take pictures. And, yeah, I know it&#39;s MY thing that I want him to look good for them (since we only see them a couple times per year). And HE knows it&#39;s MY thing, it&#39;s a favor he can do for me. If he doesn&#39;t, he doesn&#39;t. I&#39;ll live with it. And, he knows he can have my assistance in whatever way he needs - I can sponge bath him a bit at a time while watching TV if he wants (BTDT), he can shower and get it done himself all at once. The details are up to him, as well as the choice of whether to do this favor or not. He used to love baths but now he&#39;s gotten LONG and doesn&#39;t feel comfortable sitting in the tub. At the same time, he doesn&#39;t like water spraying in his face shower-wise. So, we have a hand held wall mounted shower head - it can sit in the bracket and spray down or it can be hand held so the spray doesn&#39;t get in his face, however he chooses. If he chooses, he can wear his bathing suit into the shower and I&#39;ll wash his hair for him (adolescent modesty is in full bloom). We&#39;ll see how it all works out.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

You keep the information on why you choose to do it  <br/>\nshort and don&#39;t repeat it more than, say, once a year ;-) You keep it  <br/>\nin perspective!<br/>\n<br/>\nMake the goal thoughtfully choosing to wash hands as needed as an  <br/>\nadult, rather than a rule that he must do it right now every time mom  <br/>\nbelieves it needs done. Right  now he&#39;s on a path of thoughtfully  <br/>\nchoosing not to do anything adults tell him to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it&#39;s important to wash hands after pooping, it&#39;s so the germs  <br/>\ndon&#39;t spread to others. If you&#39;ve pooped out germs, they&#39;re already in  <br/>\nyou and your immune system already has a handle on those. And since  <br/>\nhe&#39;s with you guys, you&#39;ve probably all got the same germs in you. So  <br/>\nhe&#39;s not spreading deadly germs around to the family if he doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nwash his hands this time, next time or the tenth time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for outside germs, he&#39;s undoubtedly already immune to 99.9% of what  <br/>\nhe&#39;s picking up out there since it probably isn&#39;t changing much!<br/>\n<br/>\nPartner with him in washing before eating which is when he&#39;s most  <br/>\nlikely to introduce some foreign germs. Keep it light. Make it part of  <br/>\nthe routine. Say &quot;Let&#39;s wash up before eating.&quot; Let him choose to no  <br/>\nwash, but you wash. Make sure there&#39;s fun soap and any other  <br/>\nobjections to washing have been dealt with. Ask him if there&#39;s another  <br/>\nway to keep outside germs off his food. Maybe wear gloves. Maybe pick  <br/>\nthe food up with tongs or toothpicks or forks. Or napkins. (Keep these  <br/>\nsuggestion light and fun and not every time. Keep it nonpressured. Let  <br/>\nhim choose to do nothing. Let the idea swirl around him so he can  <br/>\nthoughtfully choose to wash his hands.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Finn, four and a half, has started to refuse to wash his hands on a  <br/>\n&gt; regular basis and will lie about doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When parents become a road block between kids and what kids want, they  <br/>\nprovide prime opportunities for kids to figure out ways around the  <br/>\nroadblocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the bad guy is making the good guy do something he doesn&#39;t believe  <br/>\nis right, we find it acceptable, maybe even cheer worthy :-) if he&#39;s  <br/>\nclever, if he lies or sneaks to avoid the bad guy&#39;s control and do  <br/>\nwhat the good buy believes is right.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoral: Don&#39;t be the bad guy :-) Don&#39;t be in opposition to your child.  <br/>\nBe your child&#39;s partner. Assume he doesn&#39;t want to hurt himself or  <br/>\nothers and there are roadblocks between him and being healthy. One  <br/>\nbig, huge roadblock is the ability to choose. He can&#39;t make healthy  <br/>\nchoices if choice is taken away. Other roadblocks are the time it  <br/>\ntakes! He&#39;s 4. 15 seconds spent on something irritatingly boring is a  <br/>\nhuge amount of time. When he&#39;s 6 it won&#39;t be as big. When he&#39;s 15, he  <br/>\nwon&#39;t even think about it. Another roadblock might be the soap. Go  <br/>\nwith him and let him pick out some fun soap. (Maybe a pump bottle that  <br/>\nfoams.

I am just going to ask a few<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWho has the hand washing issue? And what does this issue mean to this person? What is it<br/>\ngood for and what fear does it cater to? What does it mean about this person if &#39;hands are<br/>\nnot washed according to their &#39;needs&#39;? When is the washing of hands enough? (Remember that<br/>\nthere is also a syndrom of hand washing which is considered to be unhealthy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, as I know this, handwashing could be anything else that HAS TO BE IMPLEMENTED<br/>\nfor mere survival on grounds of something that anyone else might consider quite<br/>\nirrational. The crux is that what is being contended is a symptom which may lead to some<br/>\nroot of disconnection (quite possibly an unhandled trauma - though I maybe way off here,<br/>\ntoo.) which may be way out of the presented context. This is definitely NOT a pointing<br/>\nfingers exercise from me. Like &#39; Your wife is wrong and is at fault and should get her act<br/>\ntogether so that you all can live happily ever after.&#39; Everyone is surely doing the best<br/>\nthey can with what they know how to. There just might be something that nobody is aware of<br/>\nwhich is quite summarily being swept under the carpet.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not have an answer, but I could give you some more questions if you want to.

It really is not about the &#39;germs&#39; and<br/>\ntheir danger but about some deeply held inner assumption that the world is not a safe<br/>\nplace to be in. This is what I found for my situation.

This could very well be boiled down to an issue between myself and my wife, but I need solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinn, four and a half, has started to refuse to wash his hands on a regular basis and will lie about doing it.  My wife feels very strongly that hands should be washed after coming in from outside, after going to the bathroom.  This has resulted in some yelling/forced hand-washing situations because her goals and Finn&#39;s goals are at opposite ends of the spectrum.  I&#39;m, of course, sitting smack in the middle.  After a recent incident I suggested changing to a soap and water wash after pooping and that it would be okay to use hand sanitizer in other situations - not my favorite solution since being an RN infectious diseases are in my face all of the time, but at least trying to get the needs of both parties met.  Despite strong protest, my wife did put the bottle of hand sanitizer in the bathroom the next day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI get that my wife feels hand washing cannot be abandoned at this time, especially with it being winter and the risk of getting sick increased.  I get that Finn is asserting his independence, taking some control in his life, and with us modeling the importance of hand-washing, he&#39;ll most likely return to some semblance of decent hygiene in the future.  I feel that enforcing hand-washing is not helping him, but it is meeting the goals of having clean hands and reducing the possible spread of gut bugs.  This is  my wife&#39;s primary concern.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHelp?  I know it&#39;s a simple thing, but it&#39;s causing friction in our household.  Practical solutions or philosophical solutions that might help my wife accept a higher level of risk are both welcome.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much<br/>\n<br/>\nSacha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nSacha (40), mommy to Finn (4) & Zivia (0) and wife to Megan (38)<br/>\n<br/>\nLivin&#39; la vida loca in Georgetown, Seattle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47603,"nextTopicId":47544}}
