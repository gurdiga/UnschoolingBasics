I said get what, his <br/>\nanswer, your teaching style.  Ok I was confused because the other day <br/>\nhe told me that I maybe alittle to &quot;liberal&quot; in my teaching.  Well he <br/>\ntalked about how our son was just a bucket of questions (apparently <br/>\nthey were working on their model trains).  I said yep that is most <br/>\ndays, if you find something he likes he is all consumed with it, and <br/>\nthen on to the next idea.  We do tend to use some traditional books, <br/>\nthese are choosen by our son, I guess I mix liberal art and unschooling <br/>\ntogether, but hey whatever work I say.<br/>\nSo anyways, I told my husband that it is very hard to sit him down with <br/>\na textbook, and this is why they get tossed in a box.  He gave me a <br/>\nhug, told me to keep doing what I was doing, because we had a really <br/>\ngreat child.<br/>\nMade me feel good, they really enjoyed their day togeher.<br/>\nKelli</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30269,"nextTopicId":30429}}
