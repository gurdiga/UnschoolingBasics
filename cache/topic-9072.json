I bought a bunch of bird and squirrel food from Wild Birds today (Xmas gift cards)---I want to set up the new feeders. I&#39;ll do that after I sign off here. I need to repack my VERY clean car (one of the errands) with all the fencing gear for fencing tonight.

Logan wanted Bandaids, so he picked out some Hot Wheels ones. I asked him to help me keep track of how much we were spending, because I only had $12 in cash with me. I explained why I wanted to count the $1.88 box of Bandaids as $2, then we went from there buying a loaf of bread, some prepared tuna salad, a box of popcorn, a can of Pringles, a package of cookies the kids wanted to try (generic Mallomars), and a package of cotton candy. Megan and Gracie counted to 10 over and over while we walked around. We met a couple ladies shopping who invited us to their church as we stood talking. Logan helped me to use the checkout (we love the self-checkers) and bag the groceries, then he counted the money as he put it into the machine. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Came home, and they are eating chips and PBJs watching Lilo and Stitch.

Matt never went to public","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-218529003\">Hi I am new here.  This is our 3rd year homeschooling.  Matt is 8, Carrie is 2 1/2, Annie is 1, and baby #4 is due this summer.  Matt never went to public school - we have homeschooled from the beginning.  We are ecclectic homeschoolers.  That sounds fancy but what it means here is that we throw things in here and there throughout the day and most everything depends on the craziness with the little ones and how I am feeling during this pregnancy.  Matt has ADHD so we had started with a very structured environment for him since that is generally what works well for kids who have ADHD.  However, he hated it so we have since moved to a very relaxed way of doing things.  Right now I am really bored with how we are doing things, but Matt seems ok.  I have ordered some homeschooling magazines so that I might find some inspiration.  That is also why I am on this site.  I have read some info about unschooling and I am not sure if we fit this category or not.  I do lead some of the learning<br/>\n and Matt also leads me.  It is great fun to follow his freight train of thought!  I have found that he does do well with a little bit of structure though.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Here is our day so far today......<br/>\n    took an hour to get him out of bed and going as he stayed up until well after midnight reading books.  had breakfast and did his chores.  Asked me what we were going to do first.....I pretty much always give him his choice.  He is learning multiplication and division so I give him the choice of the Twist and Shout Multipication toy or a few lessons in the Singapore math workbook.  He chooses the workbook.  Then he spends 30 minutes in his room reading something other than Captain Underpants and old Looney Tunes comic books - I think he chose one of the Secret of Droon books.  He has been dying to try   the experiment with white carnations and food coloring to see how the water travels up the stem - i actually remembered to get the flowers, so we did that.  He had a ball!!!  The best part for him was mixing the different food colorings to make the colors on the back of the box!  Then he played on the laptop with some Living Books for about 30 minutes.  Now he is in the basement<br/>\n playing on the computer for 30 minutes of free time before lunch and naptime for the little girls.  When they nap, Matt and I usually do something together - a game of Scrabble or something like that.  Then he will spend the rest of the day in his room building things with Imaginext, Magnetix, or these marble tunnel things.  He also reads A LOT!!  For Christmas he received a set of Hardy Boys hardback books so he is enjoying those as well.  We had company over the weekend and they taught me to play Texas Hold &#39;em and Matt was dying to learn too.  So, in the evenings we have been teaching him to play that with us.  He has asked me 3-4 times today if we can play NOW.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Anyway, that is our day - I really have no idea where to classify us though!!!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jill - who will find her way soon!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
