But mostly, a big heartfelt thank you and posting of<br/>\ngratitude - even veteran unschoolers continue to learn from everyone.<br/>\nSeveral threads have helped me tremendously with letting go even further<br/>\nwith areas of my own life that need to be more deeply unschooled,<br/>\nspecifically in perspective to how I treat myself.  I&#39;ve made some personal<br/>\nshifts which require more time than I want to give it to explain in a two<br/>\nminute email.  While I am a confident unschooler in my relationship with my<br/>\nchildren - my relationship with myself can always use adjustment.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway.I&#39;ll be off line for the next 10 days or so - but couldn&#39;t head off<br/>\nwithout at the very least acknowledging how wonderfully exceptional<br/>\nunschooling life is.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlways evolving,<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193844353,"authorName":"Nicole Willoughby","from":"Nicole Willoughby &lt;cncnawilloughby@...&gt;","profile":"cncnawilloughby","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"going no mail","postDate":"1140243193","msgId":10043,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMjE4MDYxMzEzLjQyMTUxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjMxOTEwLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24044,"prevInTime":10042,"nextInTime":10044,"topicId":10043,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Im off to Nashville for the weekend ( weather permitting) to see my little brother in law get married! so Im going no mail for the weekend. nicole ...
