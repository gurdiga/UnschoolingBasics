Then, get to really KNOW the actual laws of the state - what is *mandatory* and what are the repercussions? For example, in some states, you have to do standardized testing BUT no one sees the results unless you are specifically asked to produce them at some point. Otherwise, you just plop them in a folder in a drawer and there they sit until the next required test time, then they get tossed and the new envelope goes in. I&#39;ve heard some folks don&#39;t even bother opening the envelope to look at the results. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://washhomeschool.org/homeschooling/top10faq.html\">http://washhomeschool.org/homeschooling/top10faq.html</a> might help - definitely find local homeschoolers/unschoolers to find out the details of it all. If you&#39;ve been homeschooling you are probably already familiar with the laws. You can also likely google your state and unschooling and probably find some info out there on it already.

And to stop placing more value on the &quot;core academic subjects&quot; than on all of the millions of other subjects and skills worth learning. The more you read, and hear from other unschoolers, the more you will be able to feel comfortable letting go of the public school system&#39;s brainwashing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recommended reading articles on the Sudbury Valley School website, earlier. sudval.org .

It&#39;s such a blessing to have the internet so we can all quickly find support in our new ventures.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to share a bit about myself and our family before diving in with questions. I hope you&#39;ll all be patient with me, this might be looooong as I enjoy talking. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay.... so I am a stay-at-home mother who has been married to her best friend for almost 10 years, and I have two children (DD 8 & DS 6) and two cats. I am an artist and I run a business from my home as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen our daughter was almost 6, I had a lot of anxiety about our daughter attending public school. I remembered what it did to me (my best years in schooling were when I had a year of unstructured private schooling when I was about 15) - and seeing how similar my daughter was to me, I didn&#39;t want to throw her into &#39;the world&#39; and have the same things happen to her. My husband actually came to me one day with the thought of homeschooling. I felt a wave of peace come over me. We prayed about it, and it has just become a part of our life since then.<br/>\n<br/>\nInitially, when I sat down with ideas for what I wanted to do with my children, I *ironically* wrote down a lot of ideas that could have been considered unschooling methods. But when I did research and realized there were homeschooling laws, state standards, etc. that sort of flew out the window. I can honestly say that going that route broke my spirit & excitement for homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo years and hundreds of dollars later, I have skimmed through different methods of homeschooling - classic, textbook, worksheets, Charlotte Mason, etc. and even though each had its benefits, I continue to fall away from each of them. Weeks would go by without curriculum and just &#39;doing nothing&#39;, and I&#39;d try again - two weeks later, we&#39;d stop again for a month or more. I fall away more quickly each time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the past week I have been evaluating our lives here at home in what &#39;should&#39; be &#39;homeschooling&#39; time. I have had long stretches of time where I felt like we &#39;weren&#39;t doing anything&#39; and it got me down. I felt like a failure. After my father passed away about 2 years ago, it grew increasingly more difficult. BUT - in prayer and searching on the internet for help in homeschooling today, I grew to realize something.  The times that we had relaxed and just enjoyed life, where I shared things I had learned, took the kids to interesting places, showed them the beauty of the world outside our door, played with our cats, walked in the leaves, crafting & drawing, or curled up and enjoyed a movie - THOSE were the moments that stuck with me the hardest. Those were the times I kept returning to when I would fall away from &#39;curriculum&#39;. I had been in an unschooling mode all along, all I needed to do was re-direct myself!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to admit, I am scared. I have been reading Sandra Dodd&#39;s articles & watching some of her videos on Youtube like crazy today. It is helping immensely. But of course, how I was raised with an uptight mother & a &#39;spotless&#39; house (heaven knows mine is nowhere NEAR close to that) and public school stripping away a lot of my individuality... well, I have a lot to unlearn. But I look at my life and realize that my TRUE love for learning came from my own delight-driven education. I taught myself most of what I still know today by delving into things that interested me. THOSE are the learning experiences that stick!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if anyone here is familiar with Star Wars, but it&#39;s as Yoda says (and this has always piqued my interest ever since I was young)... &#39;You must unlearn what you have learned.&#39; I know I cannot fill a cup that is already full of standardization & the need to &#39;fit in&#39;. I want to look at the world with childlike curiosity and soak it all up like a sponge with my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love all the support I can get. I am worried about math, about state standards (I live in Washington), and how to let GO of WORRYING about those things, lol. :-) I am just BARELY getting to know Unschooling. I had always heard rumors about it, and of course all of them were harsh and negative. But now that I read about it, I am so excited. It&#39;s what I originally wanted for my children, I just never realized it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all for listening. See? I can write a novel!<br/>\n<br/>\n(hugs) Melissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48115,"nextTopicId":48188}}
