If there is a REAL reason to impose something, then by<br/>\nall means do it. But it can still be done with respect to what that<br/>\nperson wants, meeting their underlying needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re in a partnership with your child, then all issues/challenges<br/>\nare going to be handled AS a partnership rather than top-down<br/>\nmanagement style.  Of course children don&#39;t have the same experience<br/>\nand maturity that an adult does. Of course we are supposed to keep<br/>\nthem safe from harm. But a child wants to stay safe from harm too!<br/>\nThey don&#39;t always know how, nor understand consequences but if treated<br/>\nas intelligent capable human beings, they will surprise you with their<br/>\nability at a very young age.<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody here is advocating a free-for-all. Nobody is saying &quot;let your<br/>\nchild do whatever they want, regardless of the consequences&quot; yet that<br/>\nseems to be the message some folks are getting. <br/>\n<br/>\nArbitrary rules are silly. Principles help us live by a &quot;code&quot;, a code<br/>\nthat can apply in a variety of situations. My bedroom is shared by my<br/>\nchildren but I don&#39;t like food in it. They understand that. That<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean we have a rule that says &quot;You can never eat in a bedroom&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they want to watch tv in Sierra&#39;s room, they bring food in. When<br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t want mess in her room, we try to bring in mats or<br/>\nsomething to meet both needs.....food with tv AND lack of food on her<br/>\nfloor.:) The goal is to strive to meet everyone&#39;s needs, not lay down<br/>\nsome arbitrary rule. There are still codes of conduct, guidelines,<br/>\nbasic principles of treating each other well and personal boundaries.<br/>\nHeck, call it a rule. But our &quot;rules&quot; are mostly up for discussion<br/>\nbecause they center around what each of us prefers.

I thought &quot;generic unschooling&quot; (okay, so <br/>\nthere isn&#39;t a good term to differentiate, I guess) is ditch the <br/>\ncurriculum (unless the child wants it), and allowing them to learn, <br/>\nfollow interests, etc.  Setting guidelines in other areas of their <br/>\nlives, that effect the rest of the family, or not, even, but still <br/>\nallowing them to learn the things they chose to -- is that not a <br/>\nform of unschooling?  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, food/health issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose someone has a diabetic child (I don&#39;t, but have known <br/>\nsome.)  Child decides that they don&#39;t care about the consequences, <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t going to do testing, will eat whatever, and will not <br/>\ntake insulin.  This isn&#39;t a matter of respect but health and <br/>\nmaturity.  We cannot expect a young child to be mature, to make <br/>\nmature decisions, and in this example, it would have disasterous <br/>\nconsequences to respet the child&#39;s choices.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re all learning and growing constantly.

The devil is in the details -- and your <br/>\nfamily doubtless has different personalities, interests, needs, than <br/>\nmy family.  And than Mary&#39;s.  Or ...  <br/>\n<br/>\nI truly do respect that you have found that going &quot;whole hog&quot; has <br/>\nworked wonderfully for your family, and that you are passionate <br/>\nabout it.  (I tend to be passionate about things, too, in case ya <br/>\ndidn&#39;t notice. ;-))  But cannot we have some common middle ground <br/>\nthat allows us to acknowledge that there are many ways to do things, <br/>\neven unschooling?

There is no &quot;tone&quot; in most posts as we have no<br/>\nway of reading sarcasm, query or challenge into the words posted.  Our own<br/>\ntone enfluences how posts will be read.  :)  I was very recently kicked off<br/>\n(or rather asked to leave and then moderated) from an e-mail list for<br/>\nhomeschoolers.  It was for a group across the border.  I joined it because<br/>\nit was the only list for that are, a place we were considering moving and<br/>\nbecause Dan works there and I thought we might join them for some of the<br/>\n(really cool) activities that they do since it isn&#39;t that far of a drive.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve done a few things with them, but not much just because of the friggin&#39;<br/>\ngas prices (you can intone that anyway you want :) )  For the past year or<br/>\nso whenever a new person would sign on the list with their &quot;Hello, I&#39;m new<br/>\nto all this homeschooling and dont&#39; even know where to begin.  Help me.&quot;<br/>\nposts, I would offer information about unschooling.  Never the &quot;Oh this is<br/>\nthe ONLY way to homeschool and if you don&#39;t do it this way then you are a<br/>\ndolt.&quot;  But simply, &quot;I have found that unschooling has really worked well<br/>\nfor our family.  We love the freedom to learn as and what we want.  For more<br/>\ninformation you can write me off-list or visit this website.&quot;  *Everytime* I<br/>\nwould post something like that the owner would jump in and go &quot;Warning:<br/>\nUnschooling is NOT the only way to homeschool.  Please look into ALL the<br/>\ndifferent ways of homeschooling before you select one.&quot;  And yes; she would<br/>\nuse the word &quot;warning.&quot;  What I found ironic about the whole situation is<br/>\nthat she claimed that she was going to use the &quot;Classical&quot; or &quot;Trivium&quot;<br/>\napproach with her children (3 under the age of 5 - so not even &quot;starting<br/>\nhomeschool&quot; yet.)  When I asked once if she could tell me more about this<br/>\nstyle of learning she said that she really didn&#39;t know much, but that it was<br/>\nthe education that her husband was raised with in some Eastern European<br/>\ncountry and he thought it was best.  Hello?!??!?!  She is going to teach her<br/>\nchildren using a style she knows very little about but she tells other<br/>\npeople to do their homework on homeschooling.  Yeah.  Well.  I rarely posted<br/>\npersonal posts on that list and usually only posted &quot;informational&quot; posts.<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t looking to that list for support in our unschooling, just looking<br/>\nfor people to hang out with.  Very scary people to hang out with.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have found in doing work with interpersonal communication skills is<br/>\nthat people who have doubts about the way that they are doing something will<br/>\ntend to read what other people say as confrontational. They may be<br/>\nquestioning something that they have done or did something that they felt<br/>\nwasn&#39;t the right thing, but when they read that verification (that what they<br/>\ndid may not be right) they find that they have to justify their actions and<br/>\nany information, both positive and negative, is seen as a challenge.  I know<br/>\nthis list is good for questioning what people are doing by asking lots of<br/>\nquestions and for some people that can be seen as a challenge to the way<br/>\nthey are currently doing things and it makes them feel like they have to<br/>\ndefend it or prove why the suggestions won&#39;t work for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say that it felt good to get kicked off that list.  It validated,<br/>\nfor me, the things that I thought about most of these women.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":203677783,"authorName":"trektheory","from":"&quot;trektheory&quot; &lt;trektheory@...&gt;","profile":"trektheory","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Thoughts?","postDate":"1147442770","msgId":13006,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU0MjRvaSs2ZmhyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU0MHFsaCtrMGM3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":12986,"nextInTopic":13012,"prevInTime":13005,"nextInTime":13007,"topicId":12477,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It <br/>\nmeans giving the children what they need. And each child is different.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But I think it&#39;s important NOT to think you know what your child <br/>\nneeds! She can tell you. Maybe not now, but you should be able to take <br/>\nher cues. She&#39;ll let you know when she&#39;s had enough or when something&#39;s <br/>\ntoo much or not enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think a child who craves structure (like me) will develop that <br/>\nherself. If you see her struggling, you could help her tweak what she&#39;s <br/>\nalready doing---or show her an alternative. The biggest problem is <br/>\nmaking sure it&#39;s HER initiative, not *yours*!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  A lot of parents think their children need structure, when in reality, <br/>\nit&#39;s the parent that does. If the mom&#39;s structure slides, the mom <br/>\nfreaks out and starts making the children toe the line so that she can <br/>\nget things back in *her* order.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Structure&quot; (in education circles) often means curriculum. In <br/>\nUnschooling, it means a plan to the hour/day/week/month/year/whatever. <br/>\nSome children really do need to know what&#39;s going to happen next and <br/>\nnext and next. But in unschooling, they DON&#39;T need to know that math is <br/>\nat 9:00 and history at 10:00. They need to know they are going to the <br/>\npark at 10:00, lunch at 12:30 (and where), the grocery at 2:00, and <br/>\nlegos from 3:30 until supper. It&#39;s a different KIND of structure from <br/>\nthe school model. We don&#39;t need to structure their *learning*, just <br/>\nhelp structure their days for them. Their learning happens as that side <br/>\neffect.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *I* need structure to get all my list done in one day (been sliding <br/>\nsoooo much lately---too many irons in the fire! Makes me feel <br/>\npowerless. Need to stop, breathe, refocus!). But I DON&#39;T need to <br/>\nstructure my learning. I learn while I&#39;m doing all the things on my <br/>\nlists. (Yes, that&#39;s plural---I have several all going at once! &lt;bwg&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-=-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\n This is how we operate exactly... communication and understanding and<br/>\n operating on &quot;Principles not Rules&quot; - sorry can&#39;t cite that - too<br/>\n fried right now :-)<br/>\n This is how we&#39;ve always done things so I sorta felt as if I was being<br/>\n asked to go FURTHER beyond our highly liberal parenting ways or give<br/>\n up the idea of being an unschooler.<br/>\n I can see now we may just already be there on a lot of fronts and<br/>\n thats why the concept of unschooling clicked with us.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, we DO tend to ask you to go further! &lt;g&gt; I figure I can always <br/>\nbe a better parent, better spouse, better person. Just because I get <br/>\nit, doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t keep working towards a bigger, better goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If your child NEEDS structure, help her find it, develop it, channel <br/>\nit. Just be sure it&#39;s HER structure and not yours imposed on her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n Conference Coordinator<br/>\n Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n “Learn as if you were going to live forever.<br/>\n Live as if you were going to die tomorrow.” ~ Mahatma Gandhi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210051631,"authorName":"whatsreal12","from":"&quot;whatsreal12&quot; &lt;whatsreal12@...&gt;","profile":"whatsreal12","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Thoughts?","postDate":"1147157257","msgId":12895,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUzcGR1OSt2MmRlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDODM4QkExQjkyN0ZERC0xMDRDLTE0RjBAbWJsay1yMzguc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":12554,"nextInTopic":12971,"prevInTime":12894,"nextInTime":12896,"topicId":12477,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks so much for your reply, kbcdlovejoy!!
