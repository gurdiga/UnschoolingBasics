She also has 2 step-children, boy 7, girl<br/>\n11.  Just this summer, we were walking through Sears with our babies, and<br/>\nshe starts telling me how worried she is about my ds (6yo) because he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know how to read yet, and what if he has to go to school someday,<br/>\nand &quot;i just feel so bad for him and i&#39;m so worried about him and yada yada<br/>\nyada&quot;.  My ds had just gone to her ds birthday party at Chucky Cheeses, and<br/>\nevidently she was SO CONCERNED also about his social skills because he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t go out and dance with &#39;all the other kids and Chucky&#39;  Well, he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know ANYBODY else there, except the birthday boy, so he and my 4yo<br/>\nfelt best just staying by my mom&#39;s side.  HOW HORRIBLE, huh?<br/>\nAlso, her ds is a reader (of course), so I KNOW KNOW KNOW she is doing the<br/>\n&#39;comparison game&#39;.  I pretty much just told her right then and there that I<br/>\nwill not tolerate my children being compared, judged, etc against someone<br/>\nelses standards, and if I feel like that is happening, we will not be<br/>\nspending time with people who choose to do so.<br/>\nThe BEST part of this whole story, is while she was chewing my ear off about<br/>\nhow worried she was about my poor, unschooled, sad, illiterate, socially<br/>\nretarded children, they were out with their father riding down a local river<br/>\nin a canoe, stopping on every island they found, naming those islands<br/>\naccordingly (goose poop island, etc!).  They found a nest of turtle eggs,<br/>\nsaw gobs of turtles and other wildlife, and MOST importantly, were creating<br/>\nunforgettable memories with their father.<br/>\nShe (my sister) works full time, so does her husband.  THey have the step<br/>\nchildren 3 days a week.  I&#39;ve seen the interaction between their father and<br/>\nthem, far from warm and fuzzy.  They better do it and do it RIGHT (by his<br/>\nstandards), or they&#39;ll be pushed and pressured until they do.

I went<br/>\nthrough school, I did pretty good, but I was never outstanding at anything.<br/>\nI was just an average kid. As are most of the kids. Sometimes we look at<br/>\nthese kids who do exceptional things and we think it&#39;s because they&#39;re not<br/>\nbeing homeschooled that they have that opportunity. In my area, where there<br/>\nare a lot of homeschoolers of all kinds as well as private schools and the<br/>\nusual assortment of public schools, you can find kids who are doing amazing<br/>\nthings from any of the  groups.  But they are the exception, always. Not the<br/>\nnorm.  People like to point out these kinds of kids and make a big deal out<br/>\nof them and ignore all the average kids who are learning and growing in<br/>\nequally amazing but less flashy ways.  What I want for my kids is for them<br/>\nto be happy, content and able to support themselves as adults.  If they need<br/>\nto win spelling bees to do this, I&#39;ll help them all the way, but in reality,<br/>\nit will mean excepting who they are and where they are at any given time. My<br/>\noldest &quot;looks good&quot; to outsiders. She writes and directs plays. She directed<br/>\nour local Homeschool play this fall and did a fabulous job. It&#39;s who she is<br/>\nand what she would do in or out of school (actually, I think she has more<br/>\nopportunities by not being in school).  My other daughter is very good at<br/>\npeople skills. She has lots of friends, lives to hang out with her friends<br/>\nand is currently in the process of analyzing her friends to do psych<br/>\nprofiles of them. But it&#39;s not flashy and public and no one (except her<br/>\nfriends) are really aware of what she does. Neither is more or less<br/>\nimportant. Both are right where they need to be right now.  Be happy where<br/>\nyour child is right now and it&#39;s easier to enjoy the spotlight of someone<br/>\nelse&#39;s child. And quite honestly, there is something to be said for not<br/>\nbeing in the spotlight. Those expectations can be very heavy after a while<br/>\nand mistakes are glaring.  Being average and unobtrusive can have a lot of<br/>\nadvantages!! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-19, Lisa-16, Karl-14, & Ben-10.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reachhomeschool.com\">http://www.reachhomeschool.com</a>&gt; www.reachhomeschool.com<br/>\n<br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art!     &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artkunst23.com/\">http://www.artkunst23.com/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artkunst23.com\">http://www.artkunst23.com</a><br/>\n&quot;Know where to find the information and how to use it - That&#39;s the secret of<br/>\nsuccess.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955)<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Amy Bowers<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 13, 2005 9:02 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] RE: Need Support<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI would also try to find a way to be happy for them.

That&#39;s a shame, I have no problem with it. <br/>\nNosey person #2: You don&#39;t use a curriculim (sp?)? How do you know <br/>\nwhat to teach them? <br/>\nMe? So if you homeschooled your children you would need a pre-<br/>\npackaged curriculim to teach your children? I&#39;ve never had a need <br/>\nfor one. <br/>\nYou get the idea.

This is SOOO common at this young age: you&#39;re just going to <br/>\nhave to grin and bear it for a few years. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;d recommend starting now with practicing that hand wave---like, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s nothing&quot;---then turn, with <br/>\nyour nose in the air, and say, &quot;The proof is in the pudding, and I&#39;m a patient cook.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd just leave it at that. Walk away. Say no more!<br/>\n <br/>\nI did that for five years---and now MY kids are the stars! Because high school SUCKS! Suddenly our lives<br/>\ndon&#39;t look so lame! &lt;bwg&gt; My kids can look the adults in the eyes and carry on conversations. They have <br/>\npassions they are immersed in. They&#39;re confident. They&#39;re interesting. They CARE! <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd they LIKE their parents! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI refuse to go to the Lovejoy Christmas gathering any more---just not worth it. But Ben said that the <br/>\nchange was palpable! &lt;g&gt; At nine and 17, our boys were the ones everyone was impressed with. (And <br/>\nunschooling isn&#39;t looking so freaky anymore! &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t give a crap about the family&#39;s late-coming accolades, but I can look back and know I did <br/>\nthe right thing. My children are happy and engaged and engaging. Their cousins are sullen and full of hate <br/>\nand self-doubt.<br/>\n <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t chnage a thing---except that I wish that I&#39;d found unshcooling earlier!<br/>\nProof is in the pudding. Be patient. You&#39;ll enjoy the future gatherings a LOT more! &lt;G&gt; I promise!<br/>\n <br/>\n ~KellyKelly LovejoyConference CoordinatorLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a>  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95897089,"authorName":"simplemom3","from":"&quot;simplemom3&quot; &lt;sja3k@...&gt;","profile":"simplemom3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE:  Need Support","postDate":"1134473794","msgId":8272,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRubWJvMitybWl0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8273,"prevInTime":8271,"nextInTime":8273,"topicId":8272,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m new here and it s a bit embarrassing to bare my soul, but here goes....I received an email this morning from my niece, (we both have girls that are","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1379092937\">I&#39;m new here and it&#39;s a bit embarrassing to &quot;bare my soul,&quot; but here <br/>\ngoes....I received an email this morning from my niece, (we both have <br/>\ngirls that are within one month of each other in age) proudly <br/>\nannouncing that her dd just won the regional spelling bee for her <br/>\nschool.
