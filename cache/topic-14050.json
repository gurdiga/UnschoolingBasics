Within the English language <br/>\nwhat has evolved or become &quot;accepted&quot; usage is precisely how either <br/>\n&quot;correct&quot; or &quot;proper&quot; gets determined by the folks who write and publish <br/>\nthe big books.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was no such thing as standardized spelling (either correct or <br/>\nincorrect) when the Declaration of Independence was written, for <br/>\ninstance. Now, however, there is &quot;correct&quot; and &quot;incorrect&quot; spelling, and <br/>\nlikely we all have computer programs that can tell those apart. One <br/>\ncould do some research on original documents (I know because I have <br/>\nlooked at many) and find numerous text written by several different <br/>\nfounding fathers and find &quot;errors&quot; in spelling, though that&#39;s not how it <br/>\nwas perceived at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a long time, by way of another example, the grammar rule in English <br/>\nwas to use commas between all items in a series, including after the <br/>\nlast item before the coordinating conjunction &quot;and.&quot; Now, however, the <br/>\nmore accepted or preferred usage is to leave the final comma out. Give <br/>\nit another 10 years or so of being &quot;preferred&quot; and the old way will soon <br/>\nbecome &quot;incorrect.&quot; Complicate that scenario even further by taking a <br/>\ngander at the several different style guides governing different <br/>\nprofessions--commas are used differently, quotations are done <br/>\ndifferently and are &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;incorrect&quot; only by virtue of context.<br/>\n<br/>\nComing onto an elist and making broad claims about what&#39;s correct and <br/>\nincorrect language is irritating, imnsho. Talking about the principles <br/>\nbehind our phrasing choices and the effects those choices are likely to <br/>\nhave will help us all gain a deeper understanding of unschooling and our <br/>\nrelationships with others--way more so than making stylistic <br/>\npronouncements as if they were absolute fact.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (8), Julia (7), Sam (6)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com\">http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\nConnections: ezine of unschooling and mindful parenting<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://connections.organiclearning.org\">http://connections.organiclearning.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"Deb Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] more on &quot;buts&quot;","postDate":"1149436589","msgId":14062,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNjA0LjA5NTYyOS4zMTY4LjMuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":14055,"nextInTopic":14074,"prevInTime":14061,"nextInTime":14063,"topicId":14050,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"****She* was an alumna!*** OH!

When I was in<br/>\ncollege I had a professor who was a lawyer.  She was an alumnus or the<br/>\ncollege so offered to teach 1 class each term pro bono (so to speak).  She<br/>\ntaught a speech course.  Not only how to correctly pronounce words, but also<br/>\nhow to use words.  She said that the reason that she was so compelled to<br/>\nteach about speech was because of her years as a lawyer.  She said that a<br/>\nlawyer&#39;s first line of defense is the spoken language.  A lawyer can tear<br/>\napart a witness or other lawyer by shredding their words and deciphering<br/>\nwhat is a well-meant phrase.  Knowing how to correctly speak and use<br/>\nlanguage should be the top priority of any lawyer and while none of us in<br/>\nthe class were intending on becoming lawyers, it was still important for us<br/>\nto know language.  She started my quest for learning how language should be<br/>\nused verses how it is used.
