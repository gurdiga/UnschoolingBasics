One of the mom&#39;s in my homeschool group started and registered her own, and the law says, as far as I understand, that it can not be set up just for your own children.  So she has to have other kids enrolled in the school.  The school is not accredited, there is no testing or school work of any kind.  The mom also is an unschooler.
