I have made a<br/>\ncommitment to not spanking or punishing. This is regardless of how Jayn<br/>\nbehaves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the great difference is that I don&#39;t consider Obedience to be a<br/>\nvirtue or, more importantly on this list, a useful Unschooling Principle. If<br/>\nJayn chooses not to comply with some request of mine, the lack is in *me* -<br/>\nmy reasoning is insufficient, my explanation is inadequate, my request is<br/>\nunreasonable. Real aware and reasoned and mindful Compliance, comes from<br/>\nfree agreement. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it is a case of life threatening danger, why would Jayn, never expected<br/>\nto obey, not respond to a warning of danger - from a place of Trust, from<br/>\nhearing my fear expressed in my voice? If the person who claims spanking<br/>\nsaved their child&#39;s life on two occasions would like to expand on those<br/>\ninstances, I would be interested in hearing about them. Be warned that I<br/>\nwould be looking at them with a view to seeing how the same good results<br/>\nmight have been reached without the spanking. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a page talking about a lot of research about spanking including the<br/>\nEmbry study showing that spanking actually increases the number of &quot;street<br/>\nentries&quot; by toddlers.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stoptherod.net/research.htm\">http://stoptherod.net/research.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure that no-one here would advocate the use of rewards (stickers) as<br/>\nEmbry suggests, but rather would employ the strategy of empowering safe<br/>\nexplorations as has been already suggested by other posters. This also<br/>\nremoves the emotional challenge content of the testing behaviors. Spanking<br/>\nis not the best way to ensure (as far as we can ensure) safety.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn took a step onto the busy road once in a moment of excitement, but<br/>\nstepped back instantly when dh said &quot;stop&quot; very sharply. Our response was to<br/>\ngive her a lot of hugs instead of any spanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother spanked me all through my childhood. She did so because she felt<br/>\npowerless and had no better strategy. Appallingly, she was actually doing<br/>\nbetter than her own father did with her. The end result was that I have no<br/>\nmemories of life with my mother that are not tainted by fear or anger or<br/>\nresentment. None. All the joys in my life came from other people and other<br/>\nplaces than my home. I forgive her, but I am sure that she wanted to leave a<br/>\ndifferent legacy. <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the powerlessness of having a child being wild at moments, and<br/>\nwishing for control over her and her challenging behaviors. There have been<br/>\ntimes when I have been angry. Jayn has told me I had a scary face, which I<br/>\nsaw as a call to action in myself. What I do is those instances, rather than<br/>\nresorting to the primitive violent exertion of control over Jayn, is first<br/>\nremind myself to breathe, mentally reiterate my commitment NEVER to spank,<br/>\nand then look for the loving action I can take towards her. Or just to step<br/>\naway for a moment to find the desire to show her love again. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeciding never to spank does not have to mean looking into a yawning black<br/>\nvortex of chaos and helplessness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose people who don&#39;t have resentments towards their parents who spanked<br/>\nthem are lucky. Alice Miller has written a great deal, from a psychological<br/>\npoint of view, about how children, even once grown, who were hurt by their<br/>\nparents often go to any lengths to excuse them and deny the hurts. I was<br/>\nthat way when I was young also, making myself believe that I was a &quot;naughty&quot;<br/>\ngirl, who somehow deserved these punishments. I know better now. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is one place to find Alice Miller&#39;s writings:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thisisawar.com/AbuseChildren.htm\">http://www.thisisawar.com/AbuseChildren.htm</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is also a person who has written about a link between uncritical<br/>\nobedience and the rise of fascism and the horrors of the Holocaust.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople say things like &quot;I was spanked and I turned out OK&quot;. My response is<br/>\nto say that, no, you turned out to be someone who thinks it is acceptable to<br/>\nspank a child. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the greatest gifts that not punishing in any way gives to us is an<br/>\nability to stay happily present in the moment. There are no resentments<br/>\ncarrying forward. Any problems are dealt with at once. There is no<br/>\nanticipation of the future punishment tainting our next conversation after<br/>\nthe current problem - and they are all really tiny - has been solved. One of<br/>\nthe reasons sometimes given for a spanking ahead of some other punishment,<br/>\nis that it deals with the negative behavior at once. Until the next<br/>\nspanking, of course. <br/>\n<br/>\nYet here James and I are, never having to be the Enforcers (as we have no<br/>\nrules), never needing to do more than help Jayn be her best self right now<br/>\nin this moment (which is actually kinda huge), never having to fear that she<br/>\nis being sneaky or learning to lie or that she is ever going to be afraid to<br/>\nask us for help if she is ever in any kind of trouble. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am no longer a Christian, although I was brought up in the Church of<br/>\nEngland. I think there is a logic schism between the concept that coerced<br/>\nobedience to a parent needs to be taught and enforced (in order to represent<br/>\nthe relationship of the Christian and God), and the idea of adults freely<br/>\n*choosing* obedience to a loving God as an act of Faith.  I thought the<br/>\nwhole point of the Christian religion was that God has stopped needing to<br/>\npunish us since sending His Son to accept the punishment on our behalf about<br/>\n2000 years ago. It is the *absence* of punishment that makes the obedience<br/>\nworth having.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was taught in my Church of England high school divinity classes that bad<br/>\nstuff happens to good people even though they did not bring it on through<br/>\ntheir own actions, but that we can rise to those occasions.  I don&#39;t see God<br/>\nas a blackmailer. I don&#39;t see that spanking is a useful strategy for<br/>\nelucidating the loving acceptance of a loving God. I don&#39;t see coerced<br/>\nobedience as a stepping stone to Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
