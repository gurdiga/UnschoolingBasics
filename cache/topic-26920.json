At that time my spouse worked his stocks to keep a decent income. Which<br/>\nwould most likely be what he would advise, since it worked for him.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for online employment, Florida Virtual School has teachers who work online only so<br/>\nI know teacher jobs are available but once again, not something I&#39;ve looked into.  My parents<br/>\nconsidered &#39;retiring&#39; and living in an RV.  They had found that you can &#39;work&#39; campgrounds and<br/>\nsuch where you stay for awhile and help run the place.  When you&#39;re ready to move on you do.<br/>\nI&#39;d have to call my dad to find out more about that option, as once again, I wasn&#39;t interested<br/>\nso didn&#39;t listen closely, lol.  Bad me.<br/>\n <br/>\nRemember, when you calculate costs, you need to keep in mind fuel prices.  Food cost more <br/>\nin the northwest and milk is off the charts deep into Canada.  At one point, we opted to just do<br/>\nwithout when they were selling a pint of frozen milk for $5.00!  In Juneau, Alaska, it&#39;s cheaper <br/>\nto buy powders to mix your own drinks then to be premixed as you pay for shipping weight.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe used a Cummings-Diesel Pickup that walked right up the side of the steep mountains and never had to drop off our camper because it was in the bed of the truck.  Many people pulling fifth wheels had to leave their camper behind to go exploring.  Also, many people tow jeeps, trackers, neons behind the RV so when they get somewhere, they can park their &#39;home&#39; and have a runaround vehicle.<br/>\nSome campers now come equipped with motorcycle carriers, too.  Once again, I couldn&#39;t advise which<br/>\nstyle would work best for you as its all very personal choices.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;d recommend that you start getting RV&#39;ing magazines, National Park Newsletters, etc, then decide<br/>\nwhich style your family prefers.  Our slide in camper would be way too small for the size of our current family but it worked very nicely for our younger selves.  You can also visit Camper World (my parents favorite place) and also visit one of the camper shows to get a feel for just what your choices are.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy dad has been using a 35&#39; fifth wheel behind a Ford crew-cab diesel for the past ten years.  At 75 years old, he just built a slide in to load in the bed of the same truck.  I&#39;m extremely impressed that at his age, he just quit his full time job AND accepted another one.  He&#39;ll be using the camper so he and my mom can go on the road for his new job reading over construction contracts and visiting the sites.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a few sites to get you started:<br/>\nhttp://www.trailerlife.com/<br/>\nhttp://www.rv.net/forums/index.cfm/fuseaction/thread/CFB/1/TID/295636.cfm<br/>\nhttp://www.gypsyjournal.net/some_of_our_favorite_rv.htm (we used Good Sam&#39;s Club, too.)<br/>\nhttp://www.rvlifemag.com/<br/>\nhttp://www.motorhomemagazine.com/<br/>\nhttp://www.travelalaska.com/<br/>\nhttp://www.alaskaone.com/<br/>\nhttp://www.nps.gov/<br/>\nhttp://www.flyingj.com/<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!

Ten years ago, my spouse and I loaded up the kids and traveled in our pickup with a slide in camper across the USA, up the Pacific","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1638411334\">OK....I&#39;ll jump in....<br/>\n <br/>\nTen years ago, my spouse and I loaded up the kids and traveled in our pickup with a slide in camper across the USA, up the Pacific coast, into Alaska, visited for awhile then worked our way back to the Canadian Rockies, then weaved our way south visiting lots of National Parks on the way back to the East Coast.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many money saving ways to do this, one being get a Flying J membership.  Flying J&#39;s have fuel, water to refill your water tank storage, laundry facilities, and most importantly, a dump station.  We timed out our travels to hit the Flying J&#39;s to re-fuel (we had dbl tanks on our truck, too.) My spouse would dump the holding tank, then we would all shower as long as we liked, then he would dump the tanks again, so when we left, all the storage tanks were back to full and the gray & black tanks empty.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also buy a US National Park Pass <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm\">http://www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm</a> which makes visiting multiple parks affordable.  I contacted each state we planned on going through and they sent me lots of information on what their state had to see.  For Alaska, they have a travel book that they print every year telling you of everything you will need to know: Fuel stations and distance between, road construction areas, road grade, festivals and dates, etc...<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for income:  We were fortunate as neither of us worked.  My spouse had money in the stock market and we lived off our interest payments.  It helps to have your home paid off and no car payments.  At that time, we lived comfortably off $30,000. a year but we had few expenses and the kids were little.  My spouse kept us on the same &#39;budget&#39; we&#39;d have been on had we stayed home so we did advance planning.  Some activities can be pricey, so you budget them into the months spending.  We didn&#39;t stay in campgrounds often as that can become pricey.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen we returned home we bought a farm and haven&#39;t done much traveling since.  We talk about selling the place and going to live on a sailboat or back to an RV, but the kids say only if the horses come along too. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy spouse spent all his childhood summers living on a sailboat, Bahama Island, canoeing boundary waters, or RV camping.  He would be more then happy to answer questions of how to manage this.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou can also rent nice RV&#39;s so you can have a &#39;trial run&#39; before you jump in with both feet.  Six weeks might prove more then you can handle in such tight space or you may love it!  I&#39;d also recommend that you or your spouse know how to do basic vehicle maintenance, generator connections, and empty the tanks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGo RVing!  It&#39;s awesome!
