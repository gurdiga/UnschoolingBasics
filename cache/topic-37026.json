There are normal times when kids DO put on weight and *need* to do so because they are growing. I know with my DS, he &quot;inchworms&quot; so to speak - he&#39;ll get a visible bit of a belly, then he&#39;ll shoot up an inch or two, then stabilize, then repeat. I&#39;ve had the occasional anxious thought about it because weight issues run in both families along with hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes (I&#39;m type 2, diagnosed 2 years ago). BUT I remind myself of the pattern he&#39;s had since he was a baby. And I make sure that nutritious stuff is available - not hard since he&#39;s come to prefer our homemade whole grain options to most store bought stuff (except one brand of organic oreo-like cookies - he prefers them to true Oreos because he says they&#39;re creamier inside). Also, if I&#39;m getting anxious about it, I make an extra effort to find/offer/do myself some more active things like suggesting a visit to one of our favorite nature/walking trails (we go in just about any season, provided it&#39;s not pouring rain or snowing). On his own, he&#39;s decided that riding the exercise bike while reading whatever his current book is works out well for him. We got the bike for me to use but I&#39;ve decided I prefer our treadmill and DS uses the bike more often. It&#39;s quiet, it&#39;s convenient, and he can ride whenever he wants (Because it&#39;s quiet) sometimes he&#39;ll jump on the bike at 11 pm and read a bit as DH and I are heading to bed. He&#39;s determined that 5 minutes on the bike is enough for him to read one chapter in his Bionicle series book. So, he&#39;ll do 5 minutes here and there. He&#39;s also 10 Â½ so I know that he&#39;s heading into a pre-puberty time when he&#39;s likely to add weight before he sprouts up taller than me. We&#39;ve never regulated his eating in his life (aside from &quot;Well, we&#39;re out of oranges, it&#39;ll have to wait until grocery shopping on Saturday but I&#39;ll go ahead and add it to the list right now&quot;) so it&#39;s not quite the exact same situation - he has no concerns that we&#39;re going to take away something anytime soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

However, here is <br/>\nmy question regarding food control/issues.  For about 3 weeks now, <br/>\nI&#39;ve been letting my kids make their own choices about food but I <br/>\nhave also been preparing lots of healthy snacks and meals for them to <br/>\nhave as choices as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has really been excited about having some &quot;fun&quot; <br/>\noptions/choices and has been really focusing on eating lots of ice <br/>\ncream, cookies, candy, etc. Some days he does make some other <br/>\nchoices...like grilled cheese, eggs.  I find that he has been making <br/>\nchoices that *I* consider more healthy so I believe he will *balance* <br/>\nout once he truly realizes that he has these choices available to him <br/>\nwhen he wants them but I noticed tonight that he is putting on <br/>\nweight.  I don&#39;t mean to sound focused on his appearance but I&#39;m <br/>\nstarting to have some fear that he may gain a lot of extra weight <br/>\nduring this time of exploring his choices and that he may then have <br/>\nsome problems getting rid of the weight, now or when he is older.  My <br/>\nhusband was a heavy kid and his family has a tendency to be on the <br/>\nheavier side; he fears this too.  And it is not just appearances, I <br/>\nworry about his health.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to hear from anyone who has feedback/comments. <br/>\nThanks so much!<br/>\nnatalie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36999,"nextTopicId":37043}}
