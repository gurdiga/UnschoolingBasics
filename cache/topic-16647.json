He stays IN the <br/>\nhouse overnight though, so he can charge a little more. He has about a <br/>\ndozen clients. They keep him pretty busy! It&#39;s also a good transition <br/>\nfor *me*! &lt;g&gt; He stays overnight for several days: I&#39;m getting used to <br/>\nwhat it&#39;ll be like when he moves out (ugh! &lt;g&gt;). And house-sitting <br/>\nallows him to work at his other jobs at the same time---because he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to IN the house 24/7. He&#39;s just there early am when the <br/>\npets get breakfast and late afternoon when they get supper, and he <br/>\nmakes sure they&#39;re let out first thing in the morning, last thing at <br/>\nnight, and several times during the day---just like with our own dogs. <br/>\nEasy!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother job that is terribly underrated is pooper-scooping.

I know someone on another list who makes jewelweed <br/>\nsoap (natural remedy for poison ivy). Taking a page from her book, I <br/>\nmade some this year (we&#39;ve got LOTS of jewelweed, lots of poison ivy <br/>\nand my siblings are very allergic to it). It cost me roughly 50 <br/>\ncents per bar to make using a store bought glycerin base and the <br/>\njewelweed I cut out in the yard (not including time, and even then <br/>\nit was minimal). It cost a little for the molds I bought (though you <br/>\nCAN use things like tuna cans and old yogurt containers and such) <br/>\nbut the molds are reusable. Factoring it all in, it cost maybe $1 or <br/>\nso to make each bar and it can sell for $2-$4 per bar on the open <br/>\nmarket. Getting additional supplies (colorings, scents, etc) would <br/>\nrun more but again, would not add much on a per bar basis when it is <br/>\nfactored over how much you get out of it. Cutting wildflowers or <br/>\nholding a basket for cuttings is something small kids can do and I&#39;m <br/>\nsure there are other things they could be involved in, if you chose <br/>\nto make colorful labels or wrappings and such - maybe putting the <br/>\nfinished soaps into small gift bags for example. Flea markets and <br/>\ncraft fairs would be good places to both get ideas as to the market <br/>\nAND potentially set up shop on occasion. <br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":65986723,"authorName":"jane doe","from":"jane doe &lt;thebrucelisa1@...&gt;","profile":"thebrucelisa1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Another question about money!","postDate":"1156278704","msgId":16672,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwODIyMjAzMTQ0Ljg4ODYwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzODA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVjZm9oMyt1M21oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16668,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":16671,"nextInTime":16673,"topicId":16647,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... love ...
