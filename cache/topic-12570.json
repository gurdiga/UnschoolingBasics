Puberty is a door to confused attitudes.  Doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmake them wrong.  :)  I have a friend who was making table &quot;arrangements&quot;<br/>\nwhen we all went out to eat.  There were 3 adults, 3 children and 1 teen.<br/>\nWe were at a sort of fast food place with small tables.  She said, &quot;The<br/>\nadults can sit at this table.  The kids can sit at that table and we will<br/>\nput the sullen teen over across the room at her own table.&quot;  I cocked my<br/>\nhead and asked, &quot;What sullen teen?  If you are talking about Emily she is<br/>\nnot what one would call sullen.  Why don&#39;t we ask the children where they<br/>\nwant to sit?&quot;  We had a long discussion about how teens are only sullen if<br/>\nthey want to be sullen or if they are expected to be sullen.  In the end the<br/>\nkids decided that they wanted to sit together and Emily decided she wanted<br/>\nto sit with us.  I think it surprised my friend how socialble my teen really<br/>\nis!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a teen in our resource day who sits by himself often drawing.  He<br/>\nhas long hair and it is always in his face.  If an outsider were to walk<br/>\ninto the room and see him, he would probably be labeled &quot;sullen teen.&quot; (And<br/>\nif they looked at the drawings of all the fantasy creatures he so<br/>\nbeautifully draws it would be &quot;morbid sullen teen.&quot;)  But he is FAR from<br/>\nsullen.  He is ingenious, creative, funny, talented, and witty.  He is<br/>\nenjoyable to be around.  He just prefers sitting and drawing to playing ball<br/>\nor walking in the park although he&#39;s been known to do those as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12378,"nextTopicId":12565}}
