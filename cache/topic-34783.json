Quentin did language arts his<br/>\ntime4learning online skipped two sections but read the decoder book (his<br/>\ngoal - not mine) and learned about zero as a place holder for math then<br/>\nplayed Danger Zone with hubby. (Education wise this PC board game has lots -<br/>\nit is from Jurassic Park. There is everything from audio patterns to quick<br/>\ntrivia all having to do with dinosaurs.)
