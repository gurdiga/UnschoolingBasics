I also have a 5 & 2 yr old <br/>\n<br/>\nanother reason I thought unschooling would be easiest for us.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a close friend who&#39;s child in currently in a Waldorf school <br/>\n<br/>\nand is thinking of unschooling next year.  She was that is, until I <br/>\n<br/>\nstarted discussing some of the topics related to TV consumption and <br/>\n<br/>\nnutrition.  That&#39;s where I lost her.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if she&#39;s right regarding TV & computer, as they <br/>\n<br/>\npertain to eye health.  Not to mention the research on taking in too <br/>\n<br/>\nmuch violence.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if any of you are familiar with the Waldorf education <br/>\n<br/>\nmindset.  They are very child centered, however they try to control <br/>\n<br/>\neverything their children see, especially in the early years.  My <br/>\n<br/>\nfriend spoke to aanother Waldorf parent who said that unschooling <br/>\n<br/>\nsounded more like unparenting to her.  That kind of annoyed me, but <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand how it might appear that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend is fond of reminding me that children aren&#39;t hatched. They <br/>\n<br/>\nneed our guidance.  She reminds me that children have no way of <br/>\n<br/>\nknowing what is bad or good for them during the early years. How <br/>\n<br/>\nwould my 7 yr old know that excessive computer usage could effect <br/>\n<br/>\nhis eyesight in the future? <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNutrition is also a big concern.  I do not want my children to eat <br/>\n<br/>\nwhat they want when they want.  How can we refute the connection <br/>\n<br/>\nbetween healthy/poor eating habits and illness? My children know <br/>\n<br/>\nwhat&#39;s healthy; they just don&#39;t care.  I care.  If they get sick, <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m responsible.   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there&#39;s the issue of not making them help clean up.  I just <br/>\n<br/>\ndon&#39;t know about that. I get the whole idea that it is better that <br/>\n<br/>\nthey want to help, however I do not want to be the ONLY one cleaning <br/>\n<br/>\ntheir stuff.  My husband&#39;s mother did everything for him and he <br/>\n<br/>\nstruggles with responsibility as an adult.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that unschooling is really a very beautiful non- <br/>\n<br/>\nconfrontational way of raising children.  I&#39;m just not sure if my <br/>\n<br/>\nfriend may be right especially when health issues are in question. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdvice is greatly appreciated.

If limiting his TV<br/>\nand PC use is what she feels is best, then so be it.<br/>\nIf she does, and someone says &quot;Oh! You are not an<br/>\nunschooler because you do that&quot; what does that mean?<br/>\nIt means precious little. It means that that is THEIR<br/>\nopinion, and she can take it or leave it. I hope she<br/>\nwill not miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime for<br/>\nher child simply because of a definition or someone<br/>\nelse&#39;s opinion! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- sandralzires &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sandralzires@...\">sandralzires@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hello all, <br/>\n&gt; I am new to home education and due to my son&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; temperament I felt <br/>\n&gt; that unschooling would be ideal for him.

I do not want my<br/>\n&gt; children to eat <br/>\n&gt; what they want when they want.  How can we refute<br/>\n&gt; the connection <br/>\n&gt; between healthy/poor eating habits and illness? My<br/>\n&gt; children know <br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s healthy; they just don&#39;t care.  I care.  If<br/>\n&gt; they get sick, <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m responsible.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, there&#39;s the issue of not making them help<br/>\n&gt; clean up.  I just <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know about that. I get the whole idea that it<br/>\n&gt; is better that <br/>\n&gt; they want to help, however I do not want to be the<br/>\n&gt; ONLY one cleaning <br/>\n&gt; their stuff.  My husband&#39;s mother did everything for<br/>\n&gt; him and he <br/>\n&gt; struggles with responsibility as an adult.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I feel that unschooling is really a very beautiful<br/>\n&gt; non- <br/>\n&gt; confrontational way of raising children.  I&#39;m just<br/>\n&gt; not sure if my <br/>\n&gt; friend may be right especially when health issues<br/>\n&gt; are in question. <br/>\n&gt; Advice is greatly appreciated.
