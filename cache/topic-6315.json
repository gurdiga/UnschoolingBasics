She&#39;s a Girl  <br/>\nScout and her troop is planning a trip to New York City in June -  <br/>\ntaking the train from Southern California.

She&#39;s been reading a lot of Jane Austen and watching  <br/>\nthe PBS series of Jane Austen movies on Masterpiece Theater.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe spends two or three days a week hanging out with a group of  <br/>\nfriends who all love to play games - they play video games, Risk, D&D,  <br/>\nMagic the Gathering, and whatever other games they happen to feel like  <br/>\nbringing. These game days have been going on for years, now.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has a boyfriend - they go to a movie together every few weeks, and  <br/>\nlike to spend time hanging out together at the bookstore.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe talks to friends online - has friends all over the place.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe reads stuff online - goes from one interesting thing to another.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe play games at home. She makes latch hook rugs from kits. She  <br/>\ncrochets a little - makes scarves.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe listens to her ipod - has a HUGE music collection - very eclectic,  <br/>\nbut includes a significant amount of musical theater.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I can think of right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a 20 year old - Roxana. She&#39;s in Paris as part of a study- <br/>\nabroad program through the community college. She&#39;s a musical theater  <br/>\nperformer, loves language and literature. She&#39;s having a wonderful  <br/>\ntime visiting museums and historic sites and learning to live on her  <br/>\nown with roommates in a tiny tiny west bank apartment. She just got  <br/>\nback to Paris on Monday after spending a week visiting cousins and  <br/>\naunts and uncles (my husband&#39;s family) in Germany and Spain. This  <br/>\nweekend she&#39;s going to Ireland and the following weekend to London -  <br/>\nboth with other kids in the program with her. When Rox comes home,  <br/>\nshe&#39;s going to spend another year pursuing musical theater and taking  <br/>\nsome community college courses, then she plans to transfer to UC  <br/>\nIrvine, most likely, and major either in Comparative Literature or  <br/>\nAnthropology and minor in Theater. She&#39;s very intellectual and I&#39;d  <br/>\nguess she&#39;ll end up getting a PhD. Unless she makes it BIG on  <br/>\nBroadway, first. We&#39;ll see!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 23 year old, Roya, graduated from college with a degree in  <br/>\nRecreation and Leisure studies. She spent that summer working as an  <br/>\nassistant forest ranger in the back country of Alaska. Now she works  <br/>\nfor a nonprofit organization that provides services to adults with  <br/>\ndevelopmental disabilities. She is the event planner - she plans and  <br/>\nruns trips and activities. They went to Sea World one week, had a  <br/>\nbowling party another, stuff like that. But they also have BIG trips -  <br/>\nthey just went to a dude ranch in Arizona and they&#39;re going on an  <br/>\nAlaskan cruise and week-long trip to London. She&#39;s totally in charge  <br/>\nof all the planning and administering and carrying out of these trips.  <br/>\nShe just had a performance review and they gave her a 6% raise. She  <br/>\nLOVES her job.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoya also takes kung fu (Rosie is one of her instructors). She does  <br/>\nceramics, paints, has a bird, supports herself - living on her own  <br/>\nwith her boyfriend and just bought herself a new Toyota Yaris. This  <br/>\nweek she drew and painted a big mural on a wall at my sister&#39;s house.   <br/>\nShe&#39;s very artistic and crafty - crochets and knits and makes quilts.  <br/>\nShe goes running and swimming regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnough? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSupport their passions when they are young. They&#39;ll stay passionate as  <br/>\nthey get older!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re:new to unschooling","postDate":"1206551521","msgId":31297,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZzZTA1MSs4cG5jQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxM2EwMWM4OGY1NSQ0ZDAyMDdmMCQ0NDAxYThjMEByb251MmZpczR0OHNrOD4="},"prevInTopic":31294,"nextInTopic":31314,"prevInTime":31296,"nextInTime":31298,"topicId":6315,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~They are all moving forward with great purpose and passion.

Keep going. If there&#39;s something she asks <br/>\nfor (a book on web design, a better graphics package, etc) do what <br/>\nyou can to facilitate it - help her research the options, determine <br/>\nwhere it fits in the budget (we can buy this low end $25 package now <br/>\nor we can wait 3 months and get the really nice one for $75 - what <br/>\nare HER priorities - have it now, or live with what she has knowing <br/>\nthat what she really would prefer is coming), etc. Consider her a <br/>\nreal person. How would you address interests a partner or friend <br/>\nhas? For instance, my DH likes music, silly music, jazz, blues, <br/>\nclassical, Celtic are tops on the hit parade. So, if I see a TV <br/>\nprogram advertised or find out about a concert or whatever, I bring <br/>\nit to his attention. From there, it&#39;s up to him to pursue it or not. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not about me. My DS (he&#39;s 7, never been schooled) realy enjoyed <br/>\nseeing the movie The Fantastic Four. He was talking about it a lot <br/>\nfor weeks. One day, I was out doing errands and stopped in at a <br/>\nbookstore (forget the exact reason). As I was looking for whatever <br/>\nit was, I spotted a Fantastic Four graphic novel (&quot;comic book&quot;) so I <br/>\npicked it up. I brought it home and put it by DS&#39; place at the <br/>\ndinner table (that&#39;s the place things get noticed - if I want DH to <br/>\nsee something, I put it by his place). He looked at it a bit and it <br/>\nhas been sitting all alone since then. But, it&#39;s there if he wants <br/>\nit. It&#39;s his and it&#39;s his *choice*.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She is very interested in animals and I was thinking of asking her <br/>\n&gt;if <br/>\n&gt; she wants to volunteer at one of the local kennels. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t ask at this point. Mainly because it&#39;s liable to be <br/>\nperceived as a sneaky way to get her to do school - &quot;it&#39;s <br/>\neducational - science, etc&quot;. If -you- want to, get the info (is she <br/>\nold enough, for example, and what types of activities are involved, <br/>\nand what is the time committment they ask for, etc). Then you&#39;ll <br/>\nhave it available if she expresses an interest in it. Or, wait a <br/>\nyear and then ask - by then hopefully you&#39;ll have changed the <br/>\nbalance so she&#39;ll see it as you just strewing yet another item of <br/>\npossible interest for her to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185316150,"authorName":"nrskay","from":"&quot;nrskay&quot; &lt;okmardesich@...&gt;","profile":"nrskay","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"new to unschooling","postDate":"1124844918","msgId":6315,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRlZ2dobSs3YjFwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6321,"prevInTime":6314,"nextInTime":6316,"topicId":6315,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 11 yo dtr went to school for the 1st 3 years and I attempted to homeschool the last 2 years.
