Throughout the <br/>\ngrowing season, my children and I harvest lettuce, beans, <br/>\nblackberries, strawberries, tomatoes and basil among many other <br/>\ndelicacies. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe plant dill especially for the black swallowtails that flutter <br/>\nthrough our yard on which to lay their eggs.  We plant native <br/>\nflowers and shrubs to feed the wildlife and nurture those that <br/>\nspring up on their own. The native spicebush leaves turn a beautiful <br/>\nyellow in the fall after hosting spicebush swallowtail caterpillars <br/>\nthroughout the summer, then give way to glossy red berries, feeding <br/>\nthe birds that overwinter here. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur pond, home to koi and comets, attracts many species of <br/>\ndragonflies as well as black snails, numerous frogs and the <br/>\noccasional snake and boxturtle. This past spring, we purchased <br/>\ntwelve rare breed chicks to raise for fresh eggs, designing and <br/>\nbuilding the chicken house and yard that protect them from local <br/>\nwildlife and our family dog so that it rotates frequently enough to <br/>\nallow free range grazing. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re learning all about organic gardening, different ecosystems, <br/>\nwildlife and animal care, and our landscape reflects the fervor of <br/>\nour passions and our pursuit of learning through life.
