If they can&#39;t be polite, and accept a polite refusal of an invitation, that is their problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet them talk about you behind your back while you relax and figure out how you want to spend your day and get on with your life. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, next year, or the year after that, if you are feeling up to it, and have it in you to tell people when to back off (you know, no one in our family ever questions me and DH about our choices when it comes to our children -- why do you think that is? :) ) then think about whether you want to attend the annual party.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of being free is actually enjoying yourself! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I need some help for this up coming party - It is <br/>\na challenge for me to make them understand - I get stuck with &quot;It is <br/>\nthe right thing for us to do - I haven&#39;t been so sure of anything <br/>\nbefore.&quot; Well that holds very little water as it should. I am happy <br/>\nthat they care so much about my guys and don&#39;t want to discourage <br/>\nthat but how can I convince them it will be OK? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help, handouts and suggestions. <br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28012,"nextTopicId":18059}}
