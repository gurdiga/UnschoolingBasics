If more hitting is likely, the first thing will be to gently as <br/>\npossible physically prevent any further hitting. If the hitting is over, <br/>\nnot ongoing, the first thing might be to say, &quot;Whoa - what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of times I wouldn&#39;t address the actual hitting until maybe later. <br/>\nI&#39;d help resolve whatever issue led to it. Later, I might say to the <br/>\nhitter, when everything is calm, &quot;You got so frustrated you hit your <br/>\nsister.&quot; I&#39;d wait and see what the reaction is to that. We&#39;d just talk, <br/>\ncalmly, about why he did that and not something else, or maybe how it <br/>\nfelt just before he hit and what else he might do when he feels that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nException to this would be if this is a frequent occurrence. In that <br/>\ncase, I might have had this conversation multiple times already and I <br/>\nmight have said, at some point, &quot;When you hit, the hitting becomes the <br/>\nproblem, instead of what your original problem was.&quot; And, if we&#39;d gotten <br/>\nto that point, I might NOT deal with the current issue, but immediately <br/>\nsay, &quot;Hitting gets in the way of problem solving.&quot; Especially if the <br/>\nchild is continuing to try to hit, I would not move on to trying to <br/>\ndiscuss the current problem until the hitter was clearly ready and <br/>\nwilling to do that without hitting anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe MAIN thing I&#39;d do is be more present and watch for myself what is <br/>\nleading up to it. Then I&#39;d talk to the kids about what I observed and <br/>\nwe&#39;d brainstorm ways to avoid it. It might be that it is over younger <br/>\nkids grabbing toys away from the older ones, for example, since that&#39;s a <br/>\nfrequent cause of a 6 year old hitting a 4 year old. So that would be <br/>\nthe focus - how can the older kids have a safe place to play without the <br/>\nyounger ones being a nuisance?<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/1/2009 7:43 AM, Marla B. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; What is the very first thing you say or do when one sibling hits another sibling (ages 6 y0. and up)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Marla<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
