As far as I can<br/>\ntell, NJ is one of the easiest states to home/un school in. I am not<br/>\nrequired by law to let anyone know that I am keeping them out of school, nor<br/>\nam I required to have the kids take tests, provide proof of curriculum, etc.<br/>\nThere may be some reporting required if someone decides to report you to<br/>\ndyfus, but even that is a fairly straight forward thing. I have to report to<br/>\nthe state 2x a year for food stamp/Medicaid benefits (we&#39;re self-employed<br/>\nwith no health insurance - we use traditional Chinese medicine for all our<br/>\nhealth care - but wound up with a 40k bill from the hospital when I was<br/>\ntransferred there for the birth of our first daughter, so state aid came to<br/>\nour rescue!) and they are aware of our intention to keep our kids out of<br/>\npublic school, and it has never presented a problem. On the contrary, most<br/>\npeople I&#39;ve met, from intake people to my caseworkers, all think it&#39;s a<br/>\ngreat thing to do, and wish they could do it!!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are websites that can tell you what the laws are in each state<br/>\nregarding home schooling. I&#39;m sure someone on this list can tell you exactly<br/>\nwhich sites to go to for the best information. But if you&#39;re in NJ, you are<br/>\npretty much free to go your own way.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere in NJ are you?

As best I recall it (we moved away from NJ 3.5 years ago, unfortunately:-(   NJ law calls for homeschooling parents to provide an &quot;equivalent&quot; education but the onus is on the state to actually ask for proof at which point it&#39;s on you to prove it presumably however you&#39;d like.  Unless you get involved in a custody case or something, it&#39;s pretty unlikely to ever be an issue.  I&#39;m sure if you google it or ask one of the NJ homeschool groups you can find the exact wording.  But basically, you don&#39;t have to do anything in terms of reporting or testing beyond what you yourself want for your own purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n            Hi everybody.
