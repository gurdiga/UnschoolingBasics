I normally am in Trinidad - <br/>\nSouthern Caribbean - but am in South Miami Beach this week.  I used to live here up to about <br/>\n2 years ago and now am trying to be back in this area about every 2 to 3 months for a week <br/>\nor two.  It would be great to make some connections here.  I always found South Beach itself <br/>\nto have very few homeschoolers - of any philosophy - so it would be great to meet other <br/>\nhomeschoolers in this area.  But if there are any unschoolers then that would be extra <br/>\nwonderful.<br/>\nThanks a million<br/>\nGillian<br/>\nMother to 8 year old Kwamena and 3 year old Efua</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30163,"nextTopicId":30439}}
