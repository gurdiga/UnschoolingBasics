I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re unschoolers or if  <br/>\nthere will be scenes of the kids doing curriculum or not, but just  <br/>\nthe fact that they&#39;re doing this looks interesting :-) -- Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n==================<br/>\n<br/>\nHi I was wondering if you could pass this information along to your  <br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nHi my name is Kati Loud.  My family and I are homeschoolers. We RV  <br/>\nfull time and we have a show airing on TLC called Six For The Road   <br/>\nIt is  about our life and journey. One year ago we gave away and sold  <br/>\neverything we own and bought a fifth wheel and hit the road. We  <br/>\nrealized that we became caught up in life and became so busy with  <br/>\ndaily routines that we needed to take back our life. So we did what  <br/>\nwe have always dreamed of. We decided to leave it all behind and we  <br/>\nhave never looked back.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe love roadschooling! We have enjoyed learning so much while we are  <br/>\non the road. We have been able to learn hands on in the most able  <br/>\nplaces. We have been from Williamsburg to the Toilet Seat Museum. We  <br/>\nhave been to NYC and experienced the big city and we have been to a  <br/>\nsmall town in Tennessee to help tornado victims try to put their life  <br/>\nback together. We have done this as a family and we have loved it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to go from 3500 square feet to 300 square feet. We have  <br/>\nfour kids. Two girls 15 and 13 and two boys 12 and 10. We also have 3  <br/>\ndogs and a little hamster. Life in an RV can get really crowded and  <br/>\nhectic but it is fun.  The first 2 episodes air on October 29 Eastern  <br/>\nMountain and Pacific time zones are at 10:00pm and Central is at  <br/>\n9:00pm. Our next two episodes air on November 5th. Same times. Each  <br/>\nnight they will show 2 episode in a row. Please watch and help us  <br/>\nshow how many homeschoolers may be interested in a show like this. We  <br/>\nare on right after Jon and Kate plus Eight. Our production company  <br/>\nalso does there show.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease pass this info along to anyone that you think may be  <br/>\ninterested. If you would like TiVo the show and even turn all your  <br/>\nTV�s on to help our numbersJ We also re- air that night at 1:00am if  <br/>\nyou want to TiVo that also J<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a website at www.ourloudfamily.com    We are having our site  <br/>\nre built and it will be 100% in a week or so. We have a great forum  <br/>\nfor homeschooling info, travel ideas, etc. We have our blogs that are  <br/>\nstories and pictures of our journeys. We do have a contest right  <br/>\nnow . We our looking for people to help us design 3 new bumper  <br/>\nstickers. There is a $100.oo first prize for each one.  Here is the  <br/>\nlink for the dimensions etc   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourloudfamily.com/blog/view/\">http://ourloudfamily.com/blog/view/</a> <br/>\nid_75/title_loud-family-bumper-sticker-contest-win-big-money/<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go to our site you can sign up as a member. By doing this you  <br/>\ncan get Homeschool deals, travel deals and updates.  We also have a  <br/>\nMySpace type program for families. This is a safe MySpace type page  <br/>\nprogram without a lot of junk added. Just go and design a page. We  <br/>\nhave around 200 homeschool members right now. This has been a fun way  <br/>\nto meet other moms and to see pics of each other�s families and learn  <br/>\nabout their styles and making new friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will also be on the TODAY show October 29th during the 9:00 am  <br/>\nhour. They may have a glimpse of the show for you to see.
