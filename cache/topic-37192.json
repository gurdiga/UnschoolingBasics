I try my best to follow unschooling but with my 3 yo I am at a loss right now. I need some advice from some other people with late talkers. I am talking about age 3 and after. <br/>\n <br/>\nWilliam turned 3 in Oct. He is not a big talker. He has a handful of words he will say and use on a regular basis. He will also sometimes repeat things but they are not words he usually uses. Since he does not talk much communication is hard at times. There are some days where it seems all he does is YELL. I mean that SHRILL high pitched yell that makes your ears hurt. This happens when he wants my attention (will not say mombut will say daddy sometimes), something upsets him, he does not want XYZ (like today he wanted the TV off so he yelled), ect ect. I KNOW why he does this. I know he is frusturated. I know it is the best way HE knows to get my attention. I know all this. I know he is not doing it to annoy me or anything. We have always been of the mindset that he will talk when he is ready. He babbles ALL the time. Holds conversations with me, his toys, his brothers, himself but this is all in babbles that we can not understand. He is a very bright<br/>\n kid. He was doing puzzles early, imaginative play WAY before most kids I know, ect. ect. Not that I am comparing him to other kids just saying that I know it is not an intelect thing. <br/>\n <br/>\nRight now we are in the process of getting his hearing checked. He screams with loud noises like the smoke detector, his baby brother crying a certain way, people singing close by (like in a restaurant singing happy birthday), ect ect. I took him yesterday but he would not let the earbuds go in his ear so we will be working on that and trying again. He also will repeat some words and they wil sound NOTHING like the word he is trying to say. So we do not know if that is part of the speach issue. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I need to know is what can I do to help this. Some days I am ok with the screaming. However some days (like today) there is A LOT of it and it just starts to grate on my nerves. I guess I just need some been there done that stories and am wondering when your kids really started talking more then one word here and there. <br/>\n <br/>\nLisa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"Kelly Lovejoy","from":"Kelly Lovejoy &lt;kbcdlovejo@...&gt;","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] wants vs. needs vs. frivolity","postDate":"1228862092","msgId":37219,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQjI4NjU3Q0I0QTRDRS0xNkQ4LUUxREBXRUJNQUlMLU1CMTMuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDY0MzMyNS43MzQxOS5xbUB3ZWI1MjcwMS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDhDQjI4MUZDMzEyMjZFOC1DMUMtMURGNkBXRUJNQUlMLU1CMTMuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+IDw2NzE0My4zMzIwMS5xbUB3ZWI1MjcwMS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+IDw4Q0IyODQ4NkM4QzExN0EtMTM5NC01QThAV0VCTUFJTC1NQjEzLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPiA8NjQzMzI1LjczNDE5LnFtQHdlYjUyNzAxLm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":37218,"nextInTopic":37220,"prevInTime":37218,"nextInTime":37220,"topicId":37192,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You can *always* ask UNspecific questions!

I am more than willing to put $20-$25 towards <br/>\nher desired Hollister jeans purchase IF she is in need of another <br/>\npair of jeans.  I just bought all of the kids 5 pairs of jeans each.  <br/>\nMy other 5 children could care less what brand they are, but my 14 yo <br/>\ndd on the other hand wants brand name.  I have NEVER made her feel <br/>\nbadly about wanting brand name!  I have always tried to help her find <br/>\nthem for cheaper when possible.  I truly couldn&#39;t afford Hollister <br/>\njeans, so I told her I could buy her 1 pair of Hollister jeans or 5 <br/>\npairs of cheaper jeans.  She opted for 5 pairs of cheaper jeans...and <br/>\nI ended up buying her jeans from Aeropostale (online for $12-$20 each <br/>\npair)!  The other kids got their jeans from Walmart and Target for <br/>\nabout $10-$18...and everyone is happy.  She also has one pair of <br/>\nHollister jeans that were given to us as hand-me-downs last year.  <br/>\nThey have a hole in the pocket, so just the other day my hubby and I <br/>\ntook them to a woman who does complicated clothing repairs and we&#39;re <br/>\npaying $17 towards the $27 repair.  I just bought her 5 pairs of <br/>\njeans and our finances are really tight right now, so she is very <br/>\nwilling put $10 out of her $14 weekly allowance towards fixing the <br/>\njeans.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all do this thing we do differently and I am happy to see/accept <br/>\nthat!  I think the fact that some of us have 1 child and some of us <br/>\nhave 4 or 6 or 8 children makes a big difference in how we can each <br/>\nhandle money/allowance when it comes to our children&#39;s needs/wants. <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Stacey Grimm&quot; <br/>\n&lt;taboulichic@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Here&#39;s where we differ somewhat.

What they&#39;re not telling<br/>\nyou - being that they are *in the moment* - is all of the things that<br/>\nwe *do* do for them.

The solution is to cut back on some of your expensive indulgences for the kids.  What about if the parents really do not have money to indulge themselves either and the kids want everything they see?  Then how to you make them feel important while not spending your rent money on frivolous things they are going to play with once and then be tired of ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Kelly Lovejoy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 9, 2008 6:15:45 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] wants vs. needs vs. frivolity<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI received a request to post this from a reader:<br/>\n<br/>\n************ ********* ******<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you do about a child who feels he isn&#39;t important or supported?<br/>\n<br/>\nMom and dad complain regularly about how little money they have, but they don&#39;t hesitate to buy expensive organic free trade coffee and indulge their own &quot;expensive&quot; wants/needs.
