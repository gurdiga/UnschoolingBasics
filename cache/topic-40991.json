Asynchronous development (some things developing out of synch with others) is something you can learn a lot about by reading about giftedness, but its not limited to &quot;gifted&quot; kids - its just most noticable in kids who are &quot;asynchronous&quot; in the sense of being very &quot;ahead&quot; (or &quot;behind&quot;) developmentally in some few areas. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids have bigger needs than other - due to development or temperament, or just the way they happen to be wired.

If the idea utterly panics you, brush up on how to give a heimlich to a child. <br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching a child to trade doesn&#39;t guarantee the child will want to engage in that kind of negotiation to get a toy (trading works well with babies, not so well with toddlers). If you are right there in the middle of the kids playing, can you see the toy-grab coming and head it off at the pass, somehow? Offer a snack? Suggest a new game or a new location?

In general, though, how often do you like to be commanded bribed or begged? Do you typically follow requests or suggestions when you can&#39;t see the point of them? Young children are stuck in a world that doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense, surrounded by people who seem to be arbitrary and unreasonable. It doesn&#39;t matter how reasonable *you* think you are being - its the perspective of the child that matters. <br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally speaking, its not a good strategy to try to get young children to see an adult pov. They can&#39;t! They&#39;ve never been adults! But we adults have an ability they don&#39;t - we can try to envision others&#39; perspectives. We can see where children are coming from. It takes effort and practice, but we can do this, and find ways to be reasonable and helpful From the Perspective Of the Child! But like I said, examples help in terms of seeing *how* this can happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts important that young children feel capable, and that they feel like they have choices - even young children want to make some of their own decisions. So generally speaking, when younger children are lashing out, its good to look for ways to give them more options and help them feel capable. No and don&#39;t and &quot;you do this now&quot; leave children feeling powerless - its no wonder two and three yr olds have a reputation for being resisitant! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i am beginning to wonder if i should take him to a psychiatrist.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like his behavior is very age-appropriate to me, although a therapist of any kind will likely tell you he &quot;needs limits&quot;.

I can&#39;t remember all the way back to when my two kids were 3, but we do watch the 3-yo nephew. Even though he didn&#39;t walk until he was 2 and is not talking a lot yet, he seems to be exactly what I would expect when it comes to behavior. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s testing and exploring, he&#39;s trying to do things for himself, he&#39;s asserting himself, he&#39;s alternately sweet and cuddly and happy and over-the-top emotional and obstinate and uncooperative.<br/>\n<br/>\nSound familiar? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not easy being 3. (It is not easy being any age, really, something I try to remember as the kids go through each one. :) ) <br/>\n<br/>\nEverything is forbidden/delayed, all the fun stuff anyway. The pool -- you have to wait for someone to go with you. The car -- everyone gets to drive but you. The kitchen -- still blocked off. All this and you have very little, if any, concept of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, we do change things to let him explore as much as possible but he&#39;s not going in the pool alone or in our tiny kitchen when something&#39;s cooking, etc. So there are frustrations in his day. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just trying to do normal things can be frustrating. I marvel at his patience in building with blocks and other things. He can play with those big Legos for a long time, it seems to me, for 3. But then one doesn&#39;t fit on or something falls and you can end up with a flying Lego. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we get tired and his Mom and Gramma get tired. The big kids are not always in the mood to do the same thing over and over again. The world is busy and he gets taken along to many things -- sometimes just for him but he&#39;s often just riding along -- I think it must be a blur sometimes even though we talk and explain. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, no shrink on call here. We&#39;re just living with a 3-yo. Trying to remember not to overreact when he&#39;s particularly difficult.

We do have<br/>\ngood days, like today, where the twins are super sweet and playful. But even<br/>\non those days, she is completely, 100% only going to do things her way and<br/>\nin her time. I think that stubborn streak is ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL and it<br/>\nwill serve her well in life if she can teach herself to temper it a bit. It<br/>\nisn&#39;t helpful when it means she&#39;s taking something she wants out of her<br/>\nsisters hands (and making her sister cry) or breaking things that don&#39;t<br/>\nbelong to her or us (like the screen door of our rental house) or<br/>\nendangering herself (like shoving an entire piece of bread in her mouth at<br/>\nonce just because i reminded her to take little bites) or pushing and<br/>\npunching. I&#39;ve done everything possible to mitigate these situations, to<br/>\ncreate a world where they are less likely to occur (like still cutting up<br/>\nher food, teaching them how to trade, etc) ...but it is impossible to do<br/>\nthis for every situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think its about being a middle child personally. Genevieve is a<br/>\ntwin...and they are the youngest kiddos in the house...and her sister has a<br/>\ncompletely different temperament.  I don&#39;t want to take her anywhere where<br/>\nshe&#39;ll be labeled. But I have started trying techniques like those used by<br/>\nparents and caregivers of kids with ADD and aspergers. Sometimes it helps<br/>\nand sometimes it doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel bad for Genevieve because she spends so much time frustrated for no<br/>\nreason. And I feel bad for her twin sister McKenna, she&#39;s such a<br/>\nsweet-natured and easy going little girl and some days it seems she falls<br/>\ninto the shadows when we&#39;re trying to find something, anything that will<br/>\ncalm Genevieve down.  Sometimes it&#39;s hard to maintain a balance and keep<br/>\nyour sanity.

That being said, I used to baby-sit for a girl who was exactly the opposite - I couldn&#39;t touch her at all without telling her clearly in words, first what I was doing and why or she would scream and lash out. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, I&#39;ve always found it helpful to look carefully at what *I&#39;m* doing and look for things to change, and then experiment a little and see what works and what doesn&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"+Re:unschooling and toddlers","postDate":"1250123460","msgId":40998,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg1dm1zNCs4dWZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGQ3M2NhNjJlMDkwODEyMDYzOGk0YjY0YWNjNXNjZTYzMjcyMjQ2MTY3Yzc3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40995,"nextInTopic":41000,"prevInTime":40997,"nextInTime":40999,"topicId":40991,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Alternately, she may need a chance to be really active and physical before sleep - my 7yo races around the house like a mad thing for about an hour every evening or finds some other energetic bit of fun. Another consideration is how long since she&#39;s eaten. Some kids need a bite before bed to stablize their blood sugar, while others need a snack a couple hours before, but Not imediately before bed. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":348791836,"authorName":"laura white","from":"laura white &lt;laurawhiteritchie@...&gt;","profile":"katzenjammer_42","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] +Re:unschooling and toddlers","postDate":"1250103376","msgId":40995,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNiZjA0ZDUwOTA4MTIxMTU2ZzdlNzMyNzVjaDc3Y2VkZWI5NGFiMjE5OTZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGQ3M2NhNjJlMDkwODEyMDYzOGk0YjY0YWNjNXNjZTYzMjcyMjQ2MTY3Yzc3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGQ3M2NhNjJlMDkwODEyMDYzOGk0YjY0YWNjNXNjZTYzMjcyMjQ2MTY3Yzc3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40991,"nextInTopic":40998,"prevInTime":40994,"nextInTime":40996,"topicId":40991,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One of my 2-yr old twins gets hyper violent too.
