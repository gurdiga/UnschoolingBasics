He plays on the rec department teams. <br/>\nHe&#39;s played soccer for a few years now and at first the verbal<br/>\nassaults coming from the parents used to really bother me.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve that parents were treating their children that way.  THEN... <br/>\nhe started wrestling.  I have never seen ANYTHING like it in my ENTIRE<br/>\nlife.  Youth wrestling is a nightmare for non-competitive types. <br/>\nYouth wrestling was more intense then high school wrestling when I<br/>\nwould go watch my brother, way back in highschool.  I would feel<br/>\njustified in saying most parents steer clear of ever allowing their<br/>\nchild to wrestle.   It really is not a peaceful environment. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think after the initial shock of it all,  I started to see the other<br/>\nparents less and less.  I focused only on my son and his needs and<br/>\nwants.  Admittedly, we were lucky to have fabulous coaches,  who<br/>\nexemplified sportsmanship and remained positive.  I would say watch<br/>\nyour son closely, see if he even notices the other parents.  He might<br/>\nnot.  Focus on him, talk about situations as they arise.  If he is<br/>\nnoticing, it&#39;s a great opportunity to discuss real life situations and<br/>\nhow he feels about them.  Overall, my son has had extremely positive<br/>\nexperiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry not to be afraid to talk to or speak up to the coach if necessary<br/>\nand be an example to the other parents.  Sometimes I feel that is is<br/>\nnecessary to put my &quot;blinders&quot; on in order to support my son exactly<br/>\nthe way he needs me to.

I <br/>\n&gt; checked into other programs but didn&#39;t like the demands of 2 <br/>\n&gt; practices a week plus games.

My 8 yo is not athletic and not aggressive, but he is a people pleaser, so he doesn&#39;t voice his opinion.  I have talked to him several times (after reading many posts on this message board) that it is completely up to him if he wants to play basketball or ANY sport for that matter.  Before the season, I did explain to him that we really didn&#39;t have the money for him to sign up for this season, but if he wanted to play that daddy would make it happen.  I am afraid that maybe I should have kept my mouth shut because &quot;maybe&quot; he feels he has to keep playing because of the money.  My 5 yo, on the other hand, is like your son - a born athlete.  Everything he plays and touches turns into gold without any effort.  He plays sports because he LOVES them.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI really liked the suggestion from another mom of starting my own league, but with 4 little ones, I am not sure I have the energy.  Maybe I could just get other boys together for some pick-up games for my oldest.  That wouldn&#39;t be enough for my 5 yo.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI just don&#39;t want his image of sports to be tainted by something, although it may not really be bothering him, maybe just me.  I hadn&#39;t asked him or brought it up because if he hadn&#39;t noticed it before I didn&#39;t want to bring it to his attention.  Should I?  Before being part of this message board, I would never have thought about these issues and would have demanded that he &quot;stick it out&quot; because he had committed to it and we had paid money for it.  Now, I am trying to make sure I help him and give him guidance, while continuing to trust that he will let me know how I can help him.

For you, that means being really clear that it&#39;s about your child, not about what you see or get from it. Much like with TV shows or video game choices, sometimes we&#39;re not comfortable with what our kids enjoy exploring. Dan, our youngest (8 today!), is a born athlete. He&#39;s played soccer for three seasons (currently on winter break) and really enjoys it. He&#39;s a pretty good player, and steadily improving. He also bikes in BMX, where he&#39;s quite good, especially for a kid who competes maybe twice a month, and doesn&#39;t really practice between races. Dan also runs like the wind -- it&#39;s what he was born to do. No track sports yet, but he&#39;s young for that still. Dan is a true sportsman, and very competitive. Not in an ugly, win-at-all-costs way, tho. Dan understands that if a competition has a winner, then there are also folks who don&#39;t win. Some days you win, and some you lose. Dan truly gets that the point is to do your very best, to work with your team and take your lumps. And this seems to be something he just innately knew. My dh and I aren&#39;t sports fans, or athletes. We&#39;re both bothered by the screaming parents in the stands. We&#39;ve never been ones to scream &#39;kick&#39; or &#39;shoot&#39; or &#39;run&#39; during a game. I&#39;ve coached this season, so I do sometimes give instructions from the sidelines, but not as a Mom. I&#39;ve asked Dan if he&#39;s prefer we be the screaming supportive types, and thankfully he&#39;d rather we just watched without the all the drama. He&#39;s kind of bothered by the screaming parents, but understands that some people are just that way. He also knows some kids play sports only because their parents insist on it (true for too many kids) and that their parents are often the worst screamers. Last season, he commented to me &quot;I think AJ really doesn&#39;t want to play, but since his Dad is Coach, he has to.&quot; We talked a bit about that, and Dan knows that all the choice are his, not ours. Even tho the parents&#39; behavior sometimes bothers me, Dan really enjoys sports and the ugly parts don&#39;t taint it for him, so we support him in his choice. For me it&#39;s about trusting that Dan will let us know if the overall environment of an activity is no longer working for him.

I was unhappy with our neighborhood rec center soccer and t-ball (parents yelling at 4-5 year olds!) My ds started playing at a church and the difference is amazing. At the start of the season he was 12 but placed on high school team and the older kids were great. They took him under their wings and helped him learn! And when parents misbehave they kick them out. :)\r<br/>\nBeth\r<br/>\nSent from my Verizon Wireless BlackBerry\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-----Original Message-----\r<br/>\nFrom: &quot;hmschleidt&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hmschleidt@...\">hmschleidt@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDate: Sat, 24 Jan 2009 20:14:53 \r<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Disgusted with sports programs\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI just got home from our Local YMCA.  My 8 yo plays basketball, by \r<br/>\nhis choice, and he loves to play (although he is not very good, but \r<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t know that!). My son was rotated out of the game 4 times, \r<br/>\nwhile the better children played the entire game.  That doesn&#39;t \r<br/>\nbother me too much because it didn&#39;t bother him, but it is not in the \r<br/>\nspirit of the YMCA guidelines.  My husband and I support him and \r<br/>\nwatch, but we don&#39;t scream and yell and try and coach him from the \r<br/>\nsidelines.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThroughout the last three weeks of games I have been so disgusted \r<br/>\nwith the yelling, screaming, and tormenting of the kids by their \r<br/>\nparents.  One man today had the nerve to tell his son that when he \r<br/>\nwas telling him something (the kid was in the middle of the game on \r<br/>\nthe court) that he had better listen to him. There is no team spirit \r<br/>\nin the area - many parents offer $1 per basket that the kids make.  \r<br/>\nthey usually don&#39;t encourage the other kids on the team, they just \r<br/>\nscream for their individual child to &quot;get the ball and shoot&quot;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy point in bringing this up is to ask whether it is ok for my son to \r<br/>\nbe in this environment.  I am not a &quot;sheltering&quot; person by nature, \r<br/>\nbut at 8 and 9 yo these kids should be allowed to just play the game \r<br/>\nand not feel the stress of competition.  They don&#39;t even keep score \r<br/>\nin this league until they are 10.  This is what he wants to do, but \r<br/>\nat what point, if any, should I allow my child to be subjected to \r<br/>\nthis environment when I am trying to promote a different type of \r<br/>\nenvironment at home?  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAny advice how to handle the games and the parents?  I had to remove \r<br/>\nmyself today for a few minutes so that I wouldn&#39;t say something out \r<br/>\nof line.  I said something to one parent today (hopefully, nicely) \r<br/>\nbecause he was beating up his child verbally for missing shots.  I \r<br/>\nchecked into other programs but didn&#39;t like the demands of 2 \r<br/>\npractices a week plus games.
