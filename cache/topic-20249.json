Do we always trust that very sensitive children will<br/>\neventually have the will to leave the relatively safe haven of<br/>\nmake-believe to find a way to support themselves?<br/>\nI do know a young lady who spent all her time playing an on-line game at<br/>\nthe age of 21, while coming to grips with anxieties made worse by her<br/>\nparents nasty problems. She did step away after a year or so & is happy<br/>\nto be making her own money.<br/>\nStill, I worry about my 14yo boy, who was sooo damaged by the school<br/>\nsystem. He is already obsessive-compulsive & after much rejection by<br/>\nother kids, doesn&#39;t have a great desire to socialize in person.  He<br/>\nhappily plays 8 bit games in an online community where the kids create<br/>\ntheir own games & chat while playing (Beyond).  His computer time is not<br/>\nlimited. These days he rotates between Beyond, Oblivion & the Wii. I<br/>\nremember the friendly young child I knew & wonder if he will hide at<br/>\nhome forever? The more I read these lists, the less I think so but many<br/>\nof the children we are discussing have never lived through as many<br/>\nnegative experiences as Nick. Nor are they already facing the internal<br/>\nstruggles that OCD & Tourette syndrome place on my son everyday. I would<br/>\nthink he has more reason to use virtual communities to escape. <br/>\nI&#39;ve already made the leap of faith & unschool him, I just worry about<br/>\nthe future, given his special challenges. I read to escape. Sooner or<br/>\nlater, I get bored & go looking for challenge. These games are many and<br/>\nvaried. It&#39;s the very fact that they are so challenging that worries me.<br/>\nWhy should he ever leave them?<br/>\nJudy<br/>\nMom to three gaming boys.<br/>\n <br/>\nps:All the talk of WOW has made me mention it to Nick.
