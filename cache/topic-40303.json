Compiled from 3-4 grade levels.<br/>\nThen there was hsing with my actual son. Darned if he didn&#39;t deviate from the plan! :) <br/>\nThe notebook was quickly shelved and never used again. <br/>\nBut I did go through a year where we had a traditional annual evaluation and I dutifully logged activities and collected papers and odds and ends. <br/>\nWe switched to another option in our state that fits us better and doesn&#39;t make me think of our days in terms of being split up into subjects but for a while we were close enough to a standard curric to know it didn&#39;t work for us. And it took a while to let go of a lot of that thinking -- all together, a year or two.<br/>\nShort answer: Yes. :)<br/>\nGive yourselves lots of time to transition and enjoy! :)<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":321209154,"authorName":"Melissa Lake","from":"Melissa Lake &lt;melis108@...&gt;","profile":"melis108","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Ever gone from structured curriculum to \tunschooling?","postDate":"1243565124","msgId":40313,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYzZWNhNzZjMDkwNTI4MTk0NWoxZGM5ZjlkNGllZmEzYWUzNTdlNjI5NmE2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGd2bWNvaCszaHRiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGd2bWNvaCszaHRiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40309,"nextInTopic":40353,"prevInTime":40312,"nextInTime":40314,"topicId":40303,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We re in the process of doing it right now.
