I encourage silly stuff like having pajama days where nobody gets dressed. Or, we have brownies for breakfast and bake brownies which we then proceed to eat all day until they are gone. We try to do fun stuff or do stuff that is completely out of character. Sometimes, we all pile in the car and just drive around and listen to the radio. If we see something cool, we will stop but most of the time we just drive and talk and play loud music. I remember one winter where it was in the single digits and we went out for ice cream. We had to get out of the house because we were all stressed and driving each other crazy. We have gone to the beach when it is cold and built sand castles. One time, when we could afford it, we packed up and went to a local hotel in the area and ordered pizza and spent the night. We have done other ridiculous/crazy stuff as a family just to relieve stress. The main thing is that it is not something that you would ordinarily do. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":211307854,"authorName":"mykaylabee@comcast.net","from":"mykaylabee@...","profile":"sognokids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Breaking point","postDate":"1262652331","msgId":42786,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxMzQxMTc0NjcuNzEzMTEzMTI2MjY1MjMzMTk1OC5KYXZhTWFpbC5yb290QHN6MDAwOGEuZW1lcnl2aWxsZS5jYS5tYWlsLmNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MTAwMTA0MTYxMHUxMTM4MDRjNmlhOTFmN2NiNmI0ZTE5ODI4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42785,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":42785,"nextInTime":42787,"topicId":42776,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When things get low for me (especially in these dark, rainy months of the PNW) I give myself a vacation from my LIFE!
