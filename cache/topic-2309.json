Wow. Supermom. Wow. <br/>\nPlease give yourself a break mentally, physically, emotionally. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important lesson I have learned as a parent is that I need <br/>\nto take care of myself before I can take care of anyone else. <br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;You can&#39;t serve soup from an empty pot.&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that my son will resist going and doing when we have <br/>\ndone too much out-of-the-house play or activities. My &quot;Waldorf&quot; <br/>\nfriend maintains that all of that stuff is overstimulating to <br/>\nchildren before age 10 or so. I fall closer to your side of the <br/>\nfence. We go and do alot. But I do see how my son needs time to <br/>\nprocess the activities and incorporate our outings in his play IF he <br/>\nhas non-structured, uninterrupted time to play. So, I purposefully <br/>\nprovide this for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it is hot, I try to do outings early. Then we come home to <br/>\nreflect and process and re-center ourselves in our familiar <br/>\nenvironment. One can only learn in a non-threatening environment and <br/>\nthe world has a lot of unfamiliar and disruptive activity. Even at <br/>\nthe playground, I see that he gets upset when mothers are not <br/>\nresponding to their crying babies immediately. Or when he sees others <br/>\nyelling or pushing at the pool or park. We discuss these thing at the <br/>\ntime but they are &quot;play acted&quot; at home: &quot;mama is going to take care <br/>\nof the baby&quot;, &quot;please don&#39;t take that from my hands&quot;, etc. He <br/>\nprocesses the important parts of his day in his play. This allows him <br/>\nto get a handle on the outside world. <br/>\n<br/>\nHome is a safe place to practice. Home is just as important as the <br/>\nworld. More important, even? <br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sherri-Lee Pressman &lt;sherri-<br/>\n-lee@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi there,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope someone will be able to tell me I did ok.

She is so much more out now than<br/>\never, so I am making headway:-) but still have a way to go. She was a very<br/>\npowerful figure in my life that was extremely critical and impossible for me<br/>\nto please her. And being who I am, that is the person who&#39;s approval I have<br/>\nspent the most time trying to get. It has never worked. As I learned a while<br/>\nago, she does not see herself as having value, so she can not look at me,<br/>\nwho came from her body as having value. She also has a lot of issues with<br/>\nthe fact that my 3 older siblings were adopted and then I came along as a<br/>\nsurprise. I have always been under the 8 ball to apologize for my existence,<br/>\nlike I didn&#39;t deserve to intrude on how great things were and have always<br/>\nbeen the outsider. So getting those messages out of my head are extremely<br/>\nimportant and difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the &quot;useless&quot; comment. hmmm. more useless than a 6 month pregnant<br/>\nwoman who spends her time taking care of a 4 year old? Yes I would say he is<br/>\nsometimes. He doesn&#39;t take care of the 4 year old when we are both tired or<br/>\nhot, I suck it up and do what needs to be done and he retreats. I have asked<br/>\nhim, and most of the time he is wonderful and helpful and willing to try to<br/>\ndo anything to help me out and make me happy, sometimes (like the last week)<br/>\nhe retreats into his cave and acts like a hungry bear whenever disturbed.<br/>\nVery difficult to live with.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thank you for your thoughts and insight, it has helped me get some<br/>\nclarity.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jon and Rue Kream [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skreams@...\">skreams@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Saturday, July 24, 2004 8:45 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] tell me I did ok today...<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I think I hear my mom saying that on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>nice days you should be outside,<br/>\n<br/>\n**Hi Sherri-Lee - You can&#39;t stop your mother from saying things irl, but you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to let her talk in your head &lt;g&gt;.

Wow. <br/>\nPlease give yourself a break mentally, physically, emotionally. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important lesson I have learned as a parent is that I need <br/>\nto take care of myself before I can take care of anyone else. <br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;You can&#39;t serve soup from an empty pot.&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that my son will resist going and doing when we have <br/>\ndone too much out-of-the-house play or activities. My &quot;Waldorf&quot; <br/>\nfriend maintains that all of that stuff is overstimulating to <br/>\nchildren before age 10 or so. I fall closer to your side of the <br/>\nfence. We go and do alot. But I do see how my son needs time to <br/>\nprocess the activities and incorporate our outings in his play IF he <br/>\nhas non-structured, uninterrupted time to play. So, I purposefully <br/>\nprovide this for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it is hot, I try to do outings early. Then we come home to <br/>\nreflect and process and re-center ourselves in our familiar <br/>\nenvironment. One can only learn in a non-threatening environment and <br/>\nthe world has a lot of unfamiliar and disruptive activity. Even at <br/>\nthe playground, I see that he gets upset when mothers are not <br/>\nresponding to their crying babies immediately. Or when he sees others <br/>\nyelling or pushing at the pool or park. We discuss these thing at the <br/>\ntime but they are &quot;play acted&quot; at home: &quot;mama is going to take care <br/>\nof the baby&quot;, &quot;please don&#39;t take that from my hands&quot;, etc. He <br/>\nprocesses the important parts of his day in his play. This allows him <br/>\nto get a handle on the outside world. <br/>\n<br/>\nHome is a safe place to practice. Home is just as important as the <br/>\nworld. More important, even? <br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sherri-Lee Pressman &lt;sherri-<br/>\n-lee@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi there,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope someone will be able to tell me I did ok.

My dh<br/>\nis useless in the heat and has spent the better part of the last 3 days in<br/>\nhis music room where it is cool and we have barely seen him, so I have felt<br/>\nlike providing everything for my dd has fallen on me. And I thought I did<br/>\npretty good until today, but I was just done in.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we got home and I turned on the TV for her to her station (kids cartoons<br/>\nall the time) and she has sat and watched that happily, then she spent 3<br/>\nhours on the Polly Pocket website (thank you to whoever posted that URL, we<br/>\njust visited it yesterday and I have a little addict on my hands, I can&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve how much she has learned to do on the computer in two days!) and<br/>\nthen more TV. It will be bedtime soon, and then we will read some stories.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI just feel like I have let her down, like I should have taken her to a<br/>\nwater park or to the lake or something to play and be outside in the nice<br/>\nweather and in the water to cool down. I think I hear my mom saying that on<br/>\nnice days you should be outside, which I guess I agree with, but sometimes<br/>\nit is just too hot to be outside right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess I just need some support that having such a passive day is ok.<br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t seem unhappy, we have not had a fight, she has eaten well and I<br/>\nthink she might have learned some things. If she was bored we would have had<br/>\nless contentment and more agitation I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for listening I guess I needed to just get it out and if<br/>\nanyone has anything to say I am happy to listen to it,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\n<br/>\nNeed safe and natural health products?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aloeessence.com\">http://www.aloeessence.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2319,"nextTopicId":2331}}
