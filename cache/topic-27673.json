It&#39;s not a volunteer thing that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you learn by reading a couple of books and raising a lamb for <br/>\n </span></blockquote>slaughter.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There is chemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, radiology and surgery<br/>\n&gt; techniques to learn.  All of it available in books but you actually <br/>\n </span></blockquote>have to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAll those things *can* indeed be learned outSIDE a school. But those <br/>\naren&#39;t things you would ever learn in high school anyway. Most of those <br/>\nthings are taught at the college and grad school levels. But don&#39;t <br/>\nthink they can&#39;t be learned outside a school. It&#39;s just not common.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a dedicated mentor would be the way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the kid.  If she thinks that being a vet is what she wants to <br/>\ndo YOU<br/>\nMUST get her volunteering NOW in shelters.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t have to be in shelters. There are a zillion possibiliities. <br/>\nDairy farm, dog showing, horse farms. Pretty much any kind of high end <br/>\nbreeding operation or performance training.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n  Additionally, some kids have this idea that working as a<br/>\nvet is all hugging puppies and it&#39;s not. It&#39;s putting down the otherwise<br/>\nhealthy dog because the idiot owners let it bite someone&#39;s kid and YOU <br/>\nKNOW<br/>\nit&#39;s their fault but the dog pays.  It&#39;s picking up the kitten your <br/>\nclient<br/>\njust threw at the wall because it was his kid&#39;s cat and he didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto<br/>\npay the bill.  It&#39;s trying to sew up a dog who was cut open *for fun* <br/>\nover<br/>\nThanksgiving by some lovely children and left to die but did not.  It&#39;s<br/>\nhaving clients refuse to pay thinking you should do all this out of the<br/>\ngoodness of your heart, and as much as you want to, you have school <br/>\nloans to<br/>\npay and you can&#39;t.  It&#39;s telling owners their dog is suffering and needs<br/>\ntests and meds and having them tell you a bullet is cheaper.  It can be<br/>\nrewarding but with the general downward trend in the quality of people <br/>\nand<br/>\nthe depth of their compassion, it&#39;s harder and harder to find good <br/>\nowners.<br/>\nThis is why I am not a vet.  Because I simply lack the restraint and <br/>\nwould<br/>\nhave physically assaulted at least one client by now.  As a tech I <br/>\nspent Sat<br/>\nafternoons euthanizing the puppy mill puppies from the local pet store <br/>\nthat<br/>\nwere too sick to sell.  5 week old puppies, and I had to pick them up, <br/>\nand<br/>\nkill them.  Week after week.  There is more to this job than playing <br/>\nwith<br/>\nkittens.  She needs to know that.  Too many kids think it&#39;s all fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been chewed on by snakes and alligators.  I&#39;ve had a wicked staph<br/>\ninfection from an iguana scratch.  I had an iguana tail whip me so hard<br/>\naround my stomach that I still have the scar.  I had a cat, high on<br/>\nketamine, deliver over 200 bite and scratch puncture wounds to my whole <br/>\nbody<br/>\nincluding my head.  There isn&#39;t a part of me that isn&#39;t scarred.  She <br/>\nhas to<br/>\nhave the dedication to be able to reach into a carrier knowing she&#39;s <br/>\ngoing<br/>\nto get bit and remove the animal.  She can&#39;t be scared of blood nor of<br/>\nfeces.  She can&#39;t be scared of or so upset by death that she can&#39;t <br/>\nperform<br/>\nher job.  She can&#39;t cry.  (Crying is for after you do what you have to <br/>\ndo.)<br/>\nIt&#39;s not for everyone.  Just like Drs have to do with their patients, <br/>\nvets<br/>\nand techs often have to inflict pain on animals.  Many people can not do<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is the best write-up of vetmed I&#39;ve seen in a while! &lt;G&gt; <br/>\nANd why I say that &quot;I love animals&quot; is a crappy reason to get into <br/>\nvetmed---or any animal-related field.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps you to think more about what kind of discussions to <br/>\nhave<br/>\nwith her.  Feel her out.  Find out why she wants to be a vet.  If she <br/>\ncan&#39;t<br/>\ncome up with anything more than &quot;I like animals.&quot;  It&#39;s not likely the <br/>\njob<br/>\nfor her.  Additionally, (and we all hear this often) some people think <br/>\nif<br/>\nthey are vets they won&#39;t have to deal with people.  UNTRUE.  You have <br/>\nto be<br/>\ngood with people to be a successful vet.  I do not like people.  I am <br/>\nnot a<br/>\nvet.  I started on that path but found a better road for me to walk.  <br/>\nThere<br/>\nare many ways to help animals that do not include being a vet.  But <br/>\nthey all<br/>\nstart with xp and pets DO NOT COUNT.  &quot;Well I always had a dog.&quot; doesn&#39;t<br/>\ndemonstrate anything legitimate to anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI so agree. It&#39;s not for those who are unwilling to get their hands <br/>\ndirty---really dirty!<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure she has animals in her life to love. If she is cut out for <br/>\nvetmed, she&#39;ll make that effort. If she&#39;s not, maybe she&#39;ll just be a <br/>\nvet&#39;s dream client and care for her own pets really well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nEmail and AIM finally together.

I think she was worried about my apparent lack of focus and me just drifting through life. Anyhow, she found a bunch of Jane Goodall books (which I would absolutely recommend to a 13 year old girl excited about animals) and sent those home to me and I read them from cover to cover completely rapt. I decided there and then that I wanted to grow up to be a primatologist and when I spoke to my mom about the idea, she told me I didn&#39;t have the right kind of mind to be a scientist. She told me that there weren&#39;t enough jobs within primatology for me to be able to make a living as a primatologist. She told me that it wasn&#39;t a realistic goal. And she told me (this wasn&#39;t all at once, but over the course of a few conversations) that I would have to<br/>\n study lots of math to become a primatologist. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe was absolutely wrong. But I didn&#39;t know that. If I had decided, or if I decided today, which I could do, that I wanted to become a primatologist that love, that excitement would have helped me to overcome the obstacles that she envisioned between me and working with the chimpanzees in Gombe National Park. If I had wanted to make it my life&#39;s work to study and learn and protect the wild chimpanzee all the other pieces would have come together, statistics, mathematical modelling, algebra, geometry, biology, all of the things that my mom saw as insurmountable hurdles, would have just been pieces of a puzzle that I was playing with. Instead her words made it seem too difficult, too hard, not worth the effort. Every female primatologist I know, and I know a few, is working. It isn&#39;t that hard of a field to work in, particularly as a woman. But rather than helping me to fulfill that dream, she decided that it was too scary, too iffy, too unreasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t do what my mom did to me. Don&#39;t tell your daughter that she must suffer through algebra worksheets to become a vet. If she really wants to be a vet, see if she would be interested in talking to a local vet, or Humane association to do volunteer work there, or see if you and she can collect and freeze some road kill and dissect it (I had a friend whose dad used to do that with her). There is a vet who lives across the road from us, I imagine if Linnaea or Simon were keen I could probably talk to her about letting them hang out with her for a day or two. Although the UK is pretty rule-bound about letting children do volunteer work before the age of 16. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimon wants to be a marine biologist and I can remember when he told me. I had fantasies about being a marine biologist as well, which my mom boosted with books, but squashed with words. So when Simon told me of his dream I had to bite back all the words of hard work and limitations and difficult employment. I had to stop my voice from speaking her words. I&#39;ve found local dive classes for children and adults which we are planning to sign up for next year (when David and the car are around more regularly) and we watch and read quite a bit about marine life. He knows so much about the life cycle of squid and sharks. Yesterday we spent a lot of time talking about what &quot;the bends&quot; were and how you have to come up slowly from a deep dive. Linnaea is worried that he will die like Steve Irwin if he becomes a marine biologist, and I can appreciate that fear, but I can&#39;t be led by it. I also figure if he never becomes a marine biologist, if that is a dream that<br/>\n he lets go of when other dreams overshadow that one, he will know that it was his choice and not my fears or doubts or obstacles that defined his dreams. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and science doesn&#39;t depend on math nearly as much as it depends on curiousity and a willingness to ask questions and to look for answers. If you stifle those things with your fears, no amount of mathematical proficiency will substitute for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n========================<br/>\nMy dd is 13 this week.

I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have worked with animals since I was 12 in many ways, volunteer, tech,<br/>\n&gt; kennel help, groomer, receptionist, obedience trainer, zookeeper, and<br/>\n&gt; behaviorist.  RE: unschooling to vet school I&#39;ve no idea.  RE: vet tech to<br/>\n&gt; veterinarian not likely.  There may be some credits that transfer but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not like she would cut years off her time in vet school. Might up her<br/>\n&gt; chances to get in though.  Think RN to DR.  RNs don&#39;t get to cut in line or<br/>\n&gt; do less schooling, save for perhaps some basics.  4-H to certified vet<br/>\n&gt; tech??  My first thought was no freaking way.  My second thought is &quot;Better<br/>\n&gt; not be.&quot;  Being a vet tech is a REAL job. It&#39;s not a volunteer thing that<br/>\n&gt; you learn by reading a couple of books and raising a lamb for slaughter.<br/>\n&gt; There is chemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, radiology and surgery<br/>\n&gt; techniques to learn.  All of it available in books but you actually have to<br/>\n&gt; go to school.  Saying it can be learned by going to an after school club is<br/>\n&gt; insulting. (Not directed at the poster btw, just at the concept.)  It&#39;s like<br/>\n&gt; saying &quot;Be a hospital volunteer and read a couple of books on blood pressure<br/>\n&gt; and be an RN.  NO FREAKING WAY is that possible and if it is, I want to know<br/>\n&gt; about it so they can be sued and the program stopped.  NOW, that being said,<br/>\n&gt; a veterinary ASSISTANT is a very different job (and the difference in pay is<br/>\n&gt; dramatic) and does not require a college degree.  Only hands on training.<br/>\n&gt; So maybe we are having a terminology problem here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Back to the kid.  If she thinks that being a vet is what she wants to do YOU<br/>\nMUST get her volunteering NOW in shelters.  All vet schools want to see<br/>\nactual experience around animals and no pets don&#39;t count.  I began by<br/>\nvolunteering at an animal shelter, then with that xp I got a job as a kennel<br/>\nworker at a vet&#39;s office, then worked as an assistant. And that begat<br/>\neverything else.  Additionally, some kids have this idea that working as a<br/>\nvet is all hugging puppies and it&#39;s not. It&#39;s putting down the otherwise<br/>\nhealthy dog because the idiot owners let it bite someone&#39;s kid and YOU KNOW<br/>\nit&#39;s their fault but the dog pays.  It&#39;s picking up the kitten your client<br/>\njust threw at the wall because it was his kid&#39;s cat and he didn&#39;t want to<br/>\npay the bill.  It&#39;s trying to sew up a dog who was cut open *for fun* over<br/>\nThanksgiving by some lovely children and left to die but did not.  It&#39;s<br/>\nhaving clients refuse to pay thinking you should do all this out of the<br/>\ngoodness of your heart, and as much as you want to, you have school loans to<br/>\npay and you can&#39;t.  It&#39;s telling owners their dog is suffering and needs<br/>\ntests and meds and having them tell you a bullet is cheaper.  It can be<br/>\nrewarding but with the general downward trend in the quality of people and<br/>\nthe depth of their compassion, it&#39;s harder and harder to find good owners.<br/>\nThis is why I am not a vet.  Because I simply lack the restraint and would<br/>\nhave physically assaulted at least one client by now.  As a tech I spent Sat<br/>\nafternoons euthanizing the puppy mill puppies from the local pet store that<br/>\nwere too sick to sell.  5 week old puppies, and I had to pick them up, and<br/>\nkill them.  Week after week.  There is more to this job than playing with<br/>\nkittens.  She needs to know that.  Too many kids think it&#39;s all fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been chewed on by snakes and alligators.  I&#39;ve had a wicked staph<br/>\ninfection from an iguana scratch.  I had an iguana tail whip me so hard<br/>\naround my stomach that I still have the scar.  I had a cat, high on<br/>\nketamine, deliver over 200 bite and scratch puncture wounds to my whole body<br/>\nincluding my head.  There isn&#39;t a part of me that isn&#39;t scarred.  She has to<br/>\nhave the dedication to be able to reach into a carrier knowing she&#39;s going<br/>\nto get bit and remove the animal.  She can&#39;t be scared of blood nor of<br/>\nfeces.  She can&#39;t be scared of or so upset by death that she can&#39;t perform<br/>\nher job.  She can&#39;t cry.  (Crying is for after you do what you have to do.)<br/>\nIt&#39;s not for everyone.  Just like Drs have to do with their patients, vets<br/>\nand techs often have to inflict pain on animals.  Many people can not do<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps you to think more about what kind of discussions to have<br/>\nwith her.  Feel her out.  Find out why she wants to be a vet.  If she can&#39;t<br/>\ncome up with anything more than &quot;I like animals.&quot;  It&#39;s not likely the job<br/>\nfor her.  Additionally, (and we all hear this often) some people think if<br/>\nthey are vets they won&#39;t have to deal with people.  UNTRUE.  You have to be<br/>\ngood with people to be a successful vet.  I do not like people.  I am not a<br/>\nvet.  I started on that path but found a better road for me to walk.  There<br/>\nare many ways to help animals that do not include being a vet.  But they all<br/>\nstart with xp and pets DO NOT COUNT.  &quot;Well I always had a dog.&quot; doesn&#39;t<br/>\ndemonstrate anything legitimate to anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\n&quot;Family isn&#39;t about whose blood you have.
