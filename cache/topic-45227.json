That&#39;s surely not what I saw as an unschooling mom, when one of the children wasn&#39;t delighting in a group or activity! <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I don&#39;t understand is how anything about planned weekly group homeschooling (even in the old group you preferred, much less the new one at which you and your children get your feelings hurt) is moving your family toward successful whole-life UN-schooling ideas and activities.  For that, why would you need to have this new group, or any group at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you thought about your own old feelings of hurt, being stuck to suffer as a shy child in whatever learning group you&#39;re put in by the adults, unable to feel you belonged yet also unable to honor those feelings and get out? It seems like answering such questions for yourself would be a more helpful direction even if you aren&#39;t unschooling, than steeling yourself against your children&#39;s unhappiness so you can stay in a group. To me that sounds like it would be setting your children up for socialization lessons, trying to teach them they might as well get used to feeling excluded and mom can&#39;t help because she doesn&#39;t know how. And even if you believe it, I hope you will think better of letting them know you see their shyness as some kind of predetermined fate or curse in your family, that dooms the children no matter what.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think this is where this is my hang up and misunderstanding with the group.  It is advertised as a learning co-op, and we do plan weekly activities.  But, when we are actually there, it is more of a play group.  There are few activities that involve all of the children at the same time.  The kids can either do the activity or not.  So, there is not a shared goal for the children and adults.  There are no shared experiences like in another group we were in before moving.  We would occassionally do things like have a Winter Holiday party and have each family take a turn sharing one favorite holiday tradition (any winter holiday - Hanukkah, Christmas, solstice, etc.).

Are the other kids mean about it or do they<br/>\njust not invite your kids to participate? Do your kids make any effort to join<br/>\nthe smaller groups?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids are in a wide range.  The smaller groups sort break off around age groups, but with a very wide berth.  The older group might include 10 and 11 yr. olds as well as teens, and then there might be another group with 11 yr. olds and down.  It kind of shifts around.  I do think my kids tend to be sensitive (it&#39;s a family trait, both inherited and learned), but there is some meanness too in the way they are turned away.  Not statements so much as kids just turning away from them and purposefully going in a different direction, when they are trying to make an effort to join the group They do lean towards being shy.  It is hard for a shy person to work up the courage to break into a group.  It takes a lot of emotional energy, and then to have your efforts rejected, it hurts even if the other person isn&#39;t trying to be mean.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;If this is a homeschool co-op that does not <br/>\n </span></blockquote>require kids to participate in the activity, then what is the goal of the group?<br/>\nDoes the group have any sort of requirements or guidelines at all?
