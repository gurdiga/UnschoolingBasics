They *will* rediscover how to enjoy learning and self-motivate, but to do that they need some time and they need help of a kind that&#39;s challenging to most parents - they need you to step back from the idea that learning is something you direct or guide or even &quot;encourage&quot; them in. Learning is a something natural that people do - humans Love to learn! But schooling diminishes that love. This is what deschooling is about! Finding the natural love of learning all over again. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m not sure what to do at this point to encoursge them to want to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The absolute best thing you can do is give them a break. Let them decompress however works best for them, even if it seems like they do nothing at all. Offer to do things that are &quot;just for fun&quot; no learning agenda. Let them watch tv and play games and chill out. They Need to chill out! While they&#39;re doing that, you can be educating yourself about what it means to learn naturally - it doesn&#39;t look like schooling! It doesn&#39;t even necessarily look like &quot;unit studies&quot;. Here&#39;s a good place to start, with more links to more good things to read at the bottom of the page:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/puddle\">http://sandradodd.com/puddle</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;She is ADHD and I am beginning to suspect possible Dyslexia and/or Dyscalcula. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beauty of unschooling is that those don&#39;t have to be roadblocks for her. Everyone learns a little differently, and if her way of learning about the world is that much more idiosyncratic, its not such a big deal as long as she&#39;s finding what works for her. A certain amount of all the three things you list above can be a result of schooling - I&#39;m not saying they &quot;don&#39;t exist&quot; but schooling can also turn perfectly normal kid behavior and variances into Issues. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8yo has a certain amount of dyslexia, for example, but it doesn&#39;t hinder her. I&#39;m not even sure it effects her reading, although it shows up when she writes. She&#39;s not being graded on her writing, she writes for pleasure and to communicate with people she knows, so she doesn&#39;t have to worry about how to form letters if that&#39;s not her top priority. She *knows* its an issue, but not because its been pointed out to her over and over. When she wants to have her writing read by people she doesn&#39;t know, she types, or asks me to write for her, or double check her writing for clarity.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8yo would likely be labled with something more than dyslexia in school. How she&#39;d be labled would depend on which &quot;walls&quot; she ran into in terms of boredom or social issues or sensory matters. At home, those are things she can learn about without the pressure of performance. If she&#39;s struggling to communicate verbally, she can try different strategies without being mocked or corrected. If she&#39;s having a rough time with sensory issues, she do that too, plus she can choose to say &quot;no&quot; to sensory experiences that she&#39;s not ready for in the moment. She gets to decide on her comfort zone and decide when and how much to move beyond it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know when I was homeschooling my now-16yo he seemed to have more &quot;issues&quot; that have largely resolved with unschooling. He&#39;s still a quirky individual, but that&#39;s not a problem, if you see what I mean?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m eally worried that the Board of Ed where I live will have something to say about this <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nDealing with the legal aspects is a separate thing - there are unschoolers who manage in some very heavily regulated areas! Its a matter of learning how to translate the very real learning that goes on all the time (even now, in your home, believe it or not!) into language that appeases the Powers that Be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to know the law well, know the specific minimum requirements for your area so you&#39;re not doing more than you need to do. The state is far far less important than your real life! Don&#39;t waste time giving them more than they ask for, spend time being with your family instead. Here are some ideas from that same big site as to how other families have translated unschooling (as it were) for the authorities:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337053754,"authorName":"witchywoman345","from":"&quot;witchywoman345&quot; &lt;witchywoman345@...&gt;","profile":"witchywoman345","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Looking for advice","postDate":"1269600311","msgId":43507,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhvaTM3bitycmNuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17112,"nextInTopic":43508,"prevInTime":43506,"nextInTime":43508,"topicId":16907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone.

There is a HUGE<br/>\ndifference from someone having asthma and someone having asthmatic<br/>\nreactions to allergies (or colds).  And how your son&#39;s body is<br/>\nreacting to pneumonia may not be a good indicator of whether or not he<br/>\nis truly asthmatic!  Most children who are diagnosed &quot;asthmatic&quot;<br/>\nactually have allergies which cause asthmatic responses.  They don&#39;t<br/>\nget short winded when they exercise or have unrelated breathing<br/>\nissues.  They may get wheezy when they are around things that trigger<br/>\ntheir allergies (dogs, cats, grass, molds, yeasts, dust, smog, smoke,<br/>\nflowers, Yankee Peddler Candles :) )  but the rest of the time they<br/>\nare fine.  It&#39;s a science of controlling the allergens rather than<br/>\nreacting to a crisis (especially if the crisis can be avoided!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a great doctor who set me straight on asthma.  As someone who<br/>\nhas had asthma since I was a young child I thought that my son also<br/>\nhad asthma.  Then we realized that his &quot;asthma&quot; was related to the<br/>\nfresh mown grass(had an &quot;ah-ha&quot; moment at a baseball game).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Looking for advice","postDate":"1156819383","msgId":16910,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZEMERCQTg4LTQzOUUtNDJGMS1CN0EyLUREM0Q3OURCQjExOUBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVkMDM5dithdHJiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVkMDM5dithdHJiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16909,"nextInTopic":16912,"prevInTime":16909,"nextInTime":16911,"topicId":16907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, my personal experiences with asthma are about 20 years old, and recently with a friends son, but I do know that most medications have multiple forms and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-86272115\">Well, my personal experiences with asthma are about 20 years old, and  <br/>\nrecently with a friends son, but I do know that most medications have  <br/>\nmultiple forms and varying ways of application.
