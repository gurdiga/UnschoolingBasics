Mentoring - connecting people up according to interests, and kids&#39; ages.<br/>\n<br/>\nMentors: Let me know how many mentees you would take, and your interests.  (Mentors don&#39;t need to be regular posters, but you DO need to be confident in unschooling and willing to share.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMentees: Let me know your interests and kids&#39; ages.<br/>\n<br/>\nI plan on doing this as soon as requests come in so that you can have the chance to email before the conference.  I will do my best to get you as close as possible to your requests.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Stickers to announce your druthers - There will be some colored stickers at the registration table for you to put on your name tag (changeable throughout the weekend as you please) signifying things like:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve been to several L & L conferences and can help you&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m shy, please talk to me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n Please send your info to me <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jparmer@...\">jparmer@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n Jill P in Colorado<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6066,"nextTopicId":566}}
