It&#39;s better to consider that the whole family is a team together, not you and dad against the child or mom and kids against dad - or &quot;the girls&quot; against the one male in the family. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe usual &quot;united front&quot; is parents against kids - which doesn&#39;t help in terms of building communication or supporting relationships. In those terms, there&#39;s no &quot;rule&quot; as to whether its better to keep adult conversations away from kids - its a matter of thinking about all the individual relationships as well as the &quot;team&quot; as a whole. How does your daughter react to intense conversations between you and dad? How does dad feel about &quot;airing his dirty laundry&quot; as it were in front of his daughter? It might be better to have some conversations privately so that your husband isn&#39;t on the defensive. It might be better to have some conversations openly so that your daughter doesn&#39;t feel shut out. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m still figuring out this unschooling thing and may have confused &quot;living an open book life&quot; with &quot;too much information,&quot; it seems!<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Too much information&quot; will vary from person to person, it will change as kids get older, it will be different when your daughter is in a cheerful mood and when she&#39;s hungry and want&#39;s some space ;) Unschooling doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you &quot;live an open book&quot; - its not terribly considerate of the needs of children to dump lots of personal issues on them! It&#39;s not a bad thing to censor yourself in that regard, out of consideration for the needs and thoughts and feelings of the people around you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn conventional thinking &quot;being a friend to your child&quot; is too often equated with parents dumping adult concerns on kids - which isn&#39;t being a *good* friend, that&#39;s for sure! Be a *good* friend to you daughter and to your husband. Think about their viewpoints, what&#39;s important to them.

But none of that should be done as a way of winning and arguement, rather as a way to connect with him and let him know his thoughts and feelings, hopes and fears are important to you. Partners are more often comfortable with unschooling when they get some of the &quot;benefits&quot; - so treat yours as respectfully as you would your child, whether or not you agree with him. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;My partner says I should not have let her check out the book and that I need to be filtering things far more for her at this age.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help to reassure him that she&#39;s unlikely to be harmed by reading things she doesn&#39;t understand - those sorts of things tends to go right past kids without having any effect on their &quot;innocence&quot;.

I have a question, of course! ;-) My daughter, who is seven, got a book from the library about &quot;girl stuff.&quot; It&#39;s a fairly thick book which covers body development, sex, dating, etc. The authors say it&#39;s for girls eleven and up. My daughter just adores this book and has even made her own version of it for fun. My partner says I should not have let her check out the book and that I need to be filtering things far more for her at this age. He says I&#39;ve taken out some of the magic of childhood and there are things not appropriate to know about at her age.<br/>\n I&#39;m torn; I do feel a little uncomfortable when she wants me to read the book aloud, although I do anyway and I&#39;ve told her about my discomfort and that it comes partly from how I was raised and partly because it isn&#39;t so common to discuss such things in detail with someone as young as she is. She is reading at an adult level and so could easily have read the book herself. I&#39;m not sure how to handle such things in the future. She has taught herself basic algebra and she knows all about the digestive system, for example, and I don&#39;t take those things away and tell her they&#39;re for older kids. And although I might not ideally have chosen for sex and dating to be her current educational passion, I do think it&#39;s nice that when she hits puberty that her development won&#39;t be a mystery but will seem natural. <br/>\n  The worst part is, that now that her dad has expressed his opinion, my daughter calls the book she made her &quot;book of shame,&quot; which is exactly what I wouldn&#39;t want. I don&#39;t ever want her to feel shame about anything.<br/>\n  Thoughts? And thanks for being there. :-)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47008,"nextTopicId":46964}}
