(Which Winchester do you<br/>\n&gt; live near?) There is not much to speak of here at first glance, but we<br/>\n&gt; are always looking for learning opportunities. I do have to drive<br/>\n&gt; quite a ways for certain things, but that is just the way it is out<br/>\n&gt; here. We are not only far from a major city, but we are far from most<br/>\n&gt; people who have alternative thinking like we do (especially any who<br/>\n&gt; have organized themselves into a group or business). I remember<br/>\n&gt; visiting my relatives in Massachusetts this summer and I loved that<br/>\n&gt; you could be remote, but that there were often many interesting,<br/>\n&gt; educated, eccentric people and businesses around these remote places.<br/>\n&gt; What I wouldn&#39;t give to have these kind of resources around me.

It brings me close to friends who<br/>\n&gt; are far way as well as has been a ways of finding new friends in my<br/>\n&gt; area and beyond.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It has been a way for me to find out about many local opportunities<br/>\n&gt; for fun and learning for my son (Though we haven&#39;t done much as of<br/>\n&gt; yet. Once my husband gets a truck for his work and I have a car I can<br/>\n&gt; use every day, there will be more.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Finances and the fact that we own eight (yes, eight) dogs interferes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with us going too far away from home.  We are quite isolated.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You said you can&#39;t travel much. Have you considered sending your kids<br/>\n&gt; somewhere: to visit a brother or another relative or to a retreat of<br/>\n&gt; some kind--maybe as counselors, so it won&#39;t cost so much. You can also<br/>\n&gt; just explore and visit places your area on day or day and a half<br/>\n&gt; trips, perhaps?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is always difficult for me and my almost 3 year old to get up and<br/>\n&gt; go somewhere like Shreveport or other nearby towns. We have a special<br/>\n&gt; diet, so I have to prepared meals for us on the road. I have thought<br/>\n&gt; about making a goal for at least one fun trip to the city a week.<br/>\n&gt; Money is very tight right now, so we are worried about how much the<br/>\n&gt; gas will cost for too much driving. I am optimistic though that we or<br/>\n&gt; he will find the opportunities and resources that are needed when the<br/>\n&gt; time comes, even though to outward seeming I live in an area devoid of<br/>\n&gt; culture and interest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I personally would try to expose them to lots of different things and<br/>\n&gt; see where it takes you. Whatever you can find. Stay busy with things<br/>\n&gt; (when they are ready and want to) and even if they reject them, at<br/>\n&gt; least they will know more about what they DON&#39;T like. While they are<br/>\n&gt; unwinding from their school-at-home experience, you can wait for them<br/>\n&gt; to reach out to you for suggestions on things to do or you could offer<br/>\n&gt; some fun ideas, like lets rent or borrow a bunch of movies or go to an<br/>\n&gt; amusement park or whatever. (if renting movies is costly, most<br/>\n&gt; libraries have movies and if there is nothing there you like, they can<br/>\n&gt; usually get a requested item through interlibrary loan. the louisiana<br/>\n&gt; interlibrary loan catalog is online and i can browse it anytime. i<br/>\n&gt; share this because most people don&#39;t think to use this resource,<br/>\n&gt; though homeschoolers i&#39;m sure are more savvy than your average library<br/>\n&gt; patron. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My fears with my other two come from our isolation, will they <br/>\n&gt; &gt; eventually be motivated to get absorbed in something they are really <br/>\n&gt; &gt; interested in, if they choose to go to college how will they get in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; without the credits they need, is our situation so unique will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschooling just not work for us, and lastly fear of ruining their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chance for success which I feel very responsible for?  I hope you have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some positive answers and ideas for me.  Is there anyone out there who<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  is in our situation or has been and has been successful?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know there are many homeschoolers and unschoolers who go onto<br/>\n&gt; college. The &quot;Unschooling Handbook&quot; shows an example of a transcript<br/>\n&gt; written for a child that was unschooled. The book also mentioned that<br/>\n&gt; colleges may look favorably on homeschooler/unschoolers because they<br/>\n&gt; may know better what they want (unlike so many college students who<br/>\n&gt; have no direction) and they are motivated to learn. But if your kids<br/>\n&gt; are like your other kids, they will find a way to get what they want,<br/>\n&gt; once something sparks their interest. I have two art degrees and I<br/>\n&gt; think I could have taught myself most of what I learned by working my<br/>\n&gt; way up in a good graphic design studio and on my own or even explored<br/>\n&gt; other areas of interest without the constraints of a degree.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, try not to feel so much pressure about them figuring things out<br/>\n&gt; by the time they are 18, when most kids go to college. I took time off<br/>\n&gt; in the middle of college and traveled and did some service. There may<br/>\n&gt; be opportunities, paid, unpaid, and free for your kids to travel/learn<br/>\n&gt; when they are old enough. I wish I had done more exploring internally<br/>\n&gt; and physically before I went to college.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Would your kids be interest in volunteering/doing an intership (paid<br/>\n&gt; or unpaid) somewhere that interests them? It might be a way for them<br/>\n&gt; to make more social contacts. (I forget how old they are.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Last week we spent the week doing no school and my kids and I pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much just layed around, read, watched T.V., etc.  I was extremely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bored except for the day we went to town for a Dr.&#39;s appointment.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What are your interests? Maybe your kids need to see you unschool<br/>\n&gt; yourself as well and pursue some of your own passions. Just an idea.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope you can find other unschoolers in your area/state for support.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have no idea if any of this is helpful, but I thought I would share.<br/>\n&gt; It is difficult to come up with the exact answers when I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; every detail of your situation and don&#39;t know your kids. You will be<br/>\n&gt; their best guide, partner and companion in exploring themselves and<br/>\n&gt; their world.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have hope for you and for us all. I sincerely believe that<br/>\n&gt; unschooling or not should not depend on where you are (if it is<br/>\n&gt; legal).

Naturally I have more questions and fears.  Let me<br/>\nexplain our situation a bit further.<br/>\nWe live in an extremely remote area on four acres in a trailer; trying<br/>\nto build a house for the last three years.  Having currently run out<br/>\nof money to complete it we have curtailed this project. The town of<br/>\nWinchester is about ten miles from our home.  My son is involved in<br/>\nCivil Air Patrol, but my daughter has no social outlets here. <br/>\nFinances and the fact that we own eight (yes, eight) dogs interferes<br/>\nwith us going too far away from home.  We are quite isolated.  So,<br/>\nalthough I am convinced that following a strict curriculum at home is<br/>\npretty much a waste of time as they will forget most of what I make<br/>\nthem learn and it will not be pertinent to what they eventually do<br/>\nwith their live I still wonder if unschooling will work in our situation?<br/>\nI have three older boys, two of which were educated through the public<br/>\nschools.  My oldest had trouble in high school only because he<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do his homework and was totally unmotivated.  He did however<br/>\nmanage to get himself into Pratt Institute in New York with a $10,000<br/>\nscholarship and a GPA of 2.6.  I believe it was his art portfolio that<br/>\naccomplished this.  He graduated this past May, one of only 160 with a<br/>\nBachelor&#39;s in Architecture.  My 21 year old is on the west coast<br/>\nlearning computer graphics and 3d amimation to some day make computer<br/>\ngames.  Please don&#39;t think I am telling you this to brag.  I just made<br/>\nthe connection that both of them are doing things that they did not<br/>\nlearn in public school.  I know they both love art.  The second didn&#39;t<br/>\nfind out how talented he was until his senior year and then paid for<br/>\nhis own private lessons, put together his own portfolio and got into a<br/>\nschool that only accepted 50 new applicants a year.  Obviously, his<br/>\ncareer also stemmed from almost an addiction to playing video games. <br/>\nBy the way he first wanted to do the progamming part of gaming, but<br/>\nswitched to the animation because in the fall of his senior year he<br/>\nfound out he hated programming from the class he was taking in school!<br/>\n They both took almost no basic courses in college; the ones that are<br/>\njust a continuation of high school, but were able to start right in<br/>\nwith their majors.  I won&#39;t go into my third son as this is getting<br/>\ntoo long, but I now see that my older kids did what they wanted and it<br/>\nvirtually had nothing to do with publc school.  Another reinforcement<br/>\nfor unschooling.<br/>\nMy fears with my other two come from our isolation, will they <br/>\neventually be motivated to get absorbed in something they are really <br/>\ninterested in, if they choose to go to college how will they get in<br/>\nwithout the credits they need, is our situation so unique will<br/>\nunschooling just not work for us, and lastly fear of ruining their<br/>\nchance for success which I feel very responsible for?  I hope you have<br/>\nsome positive answers and ideas for me.  Is there anyone out there who<br/>\n is in our situation or has been and has been successful?  A friend of<br/>\nmine who I spoke to about this I know thinks I&#39;m completely crazy.<br/>\nI am taking a religious excemption so I won&#39;t ever have to worry about<br/>\nthe authorities wanting test results and my intention to homeschool<br/>\nincluding outling my curriculum.<br/>\nLast week we spent the week doing no school and my kids and I pretty<br/>\nmuch just layed around, read, watched T.V., etc.  I was extremely<br/>\nbored except for the day we went to town for a Dr.&#39;s appointment.  I<br/>\nasked my son if he wanted to go back to doing school and he said no. <br/>\n  He has previously expressed wanting to go back to public school, but<br/>\nI am against it.  I guess I&#39;m afraid he might get so bored that he<br/>\nwill want to again.<br/>\nWell, I will stop.  I know this is way too long, but I hope someone<br/>\nwill take the time to read it and possibly respond.  I have been<br/>\nreading the Teenage Liberation Handbook which I find reinforces the<br/>\nway I feel about public schools.

If so, keep schooling <br/>\nthem at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your goal is to give your children happy childhoods (now <br/>\nteenagehoods &lt;g&gt;) with a love of learning and a deep, abiding trust in <br/>\nyou, then you&#39;ve come to the right place. Unchooling can do that. It <br/>\ncan also allow you to give your children dipomas---BUT you have to be <br/>\nwilling to let go of those schoolish goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s never too late, but you&#39;re pushing it with your son. Maybe <br/>\nconsider delaying the &quot;diploma&quot; with him so that he can heal. There&#39;s <br/>\nno &quot;end&quot; of learning, but he&#39;s going to need to DEschool a while before <br/>\nyou can consider unschooling him. Average time is one month for each <br/>\nyear spent in school or school-at-home. Maybe more for sensitive <br/>\ntypes---and maybe more if you don&#39;t quit nagging or start trusting them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDEschooling *often* looks like watching tv all day. In my house, it <br/>\nlooked like sleeping, watching TV, talking on the phone, IMing friends, <br/>\nand sleeping some more. I took Cameron (now 18) out of school at the <br/>\nend of sixth grade when he was 13. His deschooling took 18 <br/>\nmonths---more than it *should* have, but *I* had a hard time not <br/>\nnagging and pushing. I think we could have moved along more quickly had <br/>\n*I* been more deschooled! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey WON&#39;T be motivated to learn, more than likely. There&#39;s always the <br/>\nexception, of course, but they desperately need to heal. And THAT looks <br/>\nlike ...well....not much! It looks like tv and sleeping and lounging. <br/>\nBut that IS healing. AND there&#39;s learning going on there even if *you* <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to believe it! It&#39;s not easy to watch, I can tell  you. But <br/>\nif you TRUST them, they&#39;ll slowly start to trust *you* and get better. <br/>\nThen they&#39;ll find new passions or resurrect old ones, and then they&#39;re <br/>\nOFF!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much in the way of funds do you have? You&#39;ve BEEN buying curricula. <br/>\nI KNOW *that&#39;s* expensive! Instead of a curriculum, buy an iPod or join <br/>\nNetflix or a used PS2 with games. Plan travel---you can stay in <br/>\nfriends&#39; homes all across the country.<br/>\n<br/>\nColleges are starting to pursue unschoolers because of their <br/>\ninteresting lives and passions. You don&#39;t necessarily make a typical <br/>\ncollege transcript---although that&#39;s *possible*. Better to submit a <br/>\nposrtfolio with lots of letters and references. Make your child&#39;s <br/>\neducation    S T A N D  O U T !!! from all the thousands that the <br/>\nadmissions director has to slog through. Don&#39;t even TRY to make his <br/>\ntranscript look &quot;average&quot;! Make it DIFFERENT! and EXCITING! and <br/>\nLOOK-AT-ABLE!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing I can tell you from a BTDT perspective is to free your <br/>\nchildren and enjoy them. Make popcorn. Watch movies. GO places <br/>\ntogether. Live life!  THEN write down what learning you&#39;ve seen <br/>\nhappening *after* the fact. You&#39;ll be surprised! They&#39;re learning <br/>\nmachines---*after* they get all that toxicity out of their systems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s a small world...but a BIG life!&quot;   ~Aaron McGlohn. aged 6<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kixlover2000@...\">kixlover2000@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n    I have a twelve year old daughter and a fifteen year old son who  <br/>\nhave<br/>\nbeen homeschooled for about four years.

This whole idea of<br/>\nunschoooling really frightens me, but it also makes so much sense as I<br/>\nknow most of what I&#39;m teaching them now they will either have no use<br/>\nfor or they won&#39;t retain most of it.  I also want them and myself to<br/>\nhave more fun in their school day.<br/>\nAnyone who has any suggestions on how to unschool older kids who are<br/>\nused to a lot of stucture or has been in my situation and can also<br/>\nalleviate my fears, I welcome your comments.  I look forward to<br/>\nhearing from anyone soon.<br/>\n                              Thanks a lot,<br/>\n                              Joanne Barwick</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17655,"nextTopicId":17688}}
