You","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1012064623\">I think it is offensive when people who are ignorant of what the &quot;label&quot;<br/>\nactually means to people and their families make a blanket statement such as<br/>\nthat. You could also tell a parent who has a child with dyslexia that her<br/>\nproblems don&#39;t really exist, but that wouldn&#39;t be very nice. My daughter,<br/>\nwho has several learning delays, knows she is different without being told.<br/>\nGifted children are not just &quot;smart&quot;. There is a whole lot of emotional and<br/>\nsocial issues which make them different. They process information about the<br/>\nworld around them differently. Their emotions are magnified by 10. A gifted<br/>\nchild knows they are different without having to be told.  My son would tell<br/>\nyou it&#39;s not a gift, it&#39;s a curse. He wishes he was like everyone else. He<br/>\nhas many friends but still feels isolated and lonely because he has trouble<br/>\nrelating and does not enjoy many of the things they do, although he<br/>\ndisguises it well. He recognizes new information, he does not learn it. A<br/>\ngifted child does not have to &quot;apply&quot; himself. Gifted children function<br/>\ndifferently. They perceive things differently. It can be very damaging to a<br/>\nchild when a parent does not understand. I know I did my share of damage<br/>\nbefore I understood what was really going on. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like the term gifted at all. I agree with you that all children have<br/>\ngifts. I prefer asymmetric learners myself. It more describes what it truly<br/>\nis. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere many good websites that can give more information and can tell you<br/>\nwhat the term means so that maybe you could better understand. <br/>\n<br/>\nAubrey<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of frozenandcold<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 03, 2005 2:23 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] re: article on ADHD<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is gifted, really?
