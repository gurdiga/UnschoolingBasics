When I had Emily, I was<br/>\nthe first one in our group who had a baby, so *all* my friends were<br/>\nstill in the &quot;working stiff&quot; mode.  While they were more than willing<br/>\nto play &quot;auntie and uncle&quot; on the weekends or an ocaissional night,<br/>\nmost of the time they were very busy with work and being in that DINK<br/>\nmode.  We had no family to turn to either and hiring someone to come<br/>\nin was impossible since we went from two incomes to one and we were<br/>\nvery strapped.  THE solution was for me to give up on long periods of<br/>\nsleep.  When we had Mary Elayne and then Keon we were living in a<br/>\ndifferent area of the country and while we did have more family close<br/>\nby, most of them were busy with their own lives (work, school, their<br/>\nown kids) and all our friends were in similar situations as we were.<br/>\nSingle income families with multiple kids.  We tried doing a co-op<br/>\nonce where we would each take care of someone else&#39;s kids for a few<br/>\nhours each week in exchange for the same.  But, with multiple kids all<br/>\ncoming down with various illnesses, activity schedules, appointments,<br/>\nas well as our own volunteer work or other activities this too was not<br/>\nsomething we could regularly rely on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that your friend has an idyllic situation.  Available friends<br/>\nand family and a partner with a flexible work schedule.  Not everyone<br/>\nis so graced.  That&#39;s when &quot;giving things up&quot; comes in to play.  And I<br/>\nknow that I am not permanently &quot;giving things up&quot; because I know that<br/>\nmy babies are not going to be nursing through the night forever (just<br/>\nfelt like it at the moment) and that not having a dog (which is one of<br/>\nmy desires, but vehemently opposed by my co-parent, so I live<br/>\nvicariously through a friend&#39;s dog) is also not a permanent thing<br/>\nbecause I know in another dozen (or fewer years) that I won&#39;t be<br/>\nliving with Dan any longer and can have the freedom to have a dog (or<br/>\nnot - who knows by then).  I know that my &quot;sacrifices&quot; are only<br/>\ntemporary and I&#39;m patient enough to wait for those changes in my life<br/>\nto open up more avenues to explore that are momentarily on hold.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m at a point now where I can get the sleep that I need.  I have my<br/>\nown room, I have three kids who put themselves to bed when they are<br/>\ntired, I have a comfortable mattress, and I&#39;ve &quot;allowed&quot; myself to go<br/>\nto bed when I&#39;m tired instead of feeling like I needed to wait for<br/>\nsome magical appointed hour or event (such as a spouse arriving home<br/>\nlate from work.)  I may not have believed that I would get to this<br/>\npoint just 4 years ago, but voila!  Here I am.  :)  I don&#39;t mind<br/>\nputting my desires on hold when it means peace in my home.  Peace is<br/>\nmuch more desirable to me than all the other little things like sleep,<br/>\npets, chores, and perfectly tidy kitchen counters.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"Genant2@aol.com","from":"Genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Finding solutions","postDate":"1164072521","msgId":19136,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJlMi41ZmFjMzNmLjMyOTNiMDQ5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19143,"prevInTime":19135,"nextInTime":19137,"topicId":19136,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/20/2006 8:02:44 P.M.
