And I&#39;m betting with &quot;no internet without parents&quot; the reasons have to do with internet security. Have you talked about that at all? My 8yo already knows that some sites will send popups and viruses just from poking around, looking for new games sites. We didn&#39;t have to have a discussion about porn or internet stalkers for her to &quot;get&quot; the idea that not all parts of the internet are &quot;safe&quot;. That knowledge will expand as she gets older and her idea of safe/not safe grows with her. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy stepson, Ray, lived with his bio-mom for a few years, and came back to live in our unschooling home when he was 13 - that was pretty intimidating! All of a sudden I had a teenage boy! Yikes! And he wanted to play games online all night long - double yikes! So for starters, we talked about spam and filters and viruses and blockers. We talked about the hassle of dealing with sites sending us junk we didn&#39;t want and solutions to that - everthing from new and better firewalls and filters and how to have a sense of which sites are okay and which to avoid. Somewhere in there the subject of porn came up, because some of Those sites are all about sending gunk to other computers. We didn&#39;t say &quot;no&quot;, we said &quot;safe is good&quot; and let him know we trusted him to maintain the integrity of the computer (and he found some great new resources for spyware in the process...he&#39;s so cool).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also got interested in what he was looking at online - and most of it, at first, was gaming: Runescape, one of the big multi-player games. We (my partner and I) started playing, too, so that we could know what that was all about - the game part *and* the social part. We discovered that Ray was pretty good at spotting &quot;trolls&quot; - adults pretending to be kids or men pretending to be women - and found them annoying. He didn&#39;t Need some strange grown-up to give him a sense of freedom and importance, he had two grown-ups in his new home who were treating him with respect. That whole concern turned out to be a non-issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut he&#39;s a teenage boy! So what about the porn? He&#39;s discrete. He has no interest in his little sister or anyone else seeing what he likes to look at for fun - that&#39;s his private, personal business. He erases his history, and he&#39;s careful. He doesn&#39;t want a ton of sex pop-ups showing up on the computer any more than the rest of us! At one point we were letting a neighbor use our computer and Ray complained that the guy *wasn&#39;t* erasing his history when he went to porn sites - complained in a big, angry way about it, about the sites being disrespectful to women and offensive. We banned the neighbor from our computer, but at the same time, it turned out to be one of those times when a potentially icky experience is really good in parenting terms. We learned a whoooooole lot about what Ray really thinks about porn without ever crossing over into his personal business. He&#39;s not interested in &quot;offensive and disrespectful to women&quot;. That&#39;s awesome!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s more on the subject of internet security in general and porn in particular here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/sex\">http://sandradodd.com/sex</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"Karen Swanay &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] re: unschooling and bed times","postDate":"1273152840","msgId":43871,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG0ydjY3YTlkNzUwMTAwNTA2MDYzNHU0MWYzZmYwY3czNjMzMTJmZWViZjAyY2E4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU1NjI3NTI3LTgzOTUtNDE0My1CNUJCLTQ4RjU5N0RBQTEzM0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDM2MDc5MS41MzMyNy5xbUB3ZWI1MjEwMi5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+IDxyMnE2N2E5ZDc1MDEwMDUwNTEyMTNsZWI3NTZjYTV2OWVlYTc1MjAzYjA3YjQ5NUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gCTw1NTYyNzUyNy04Mzk1LTQxNDMtQjVCQi00OEY1OTdEQUExMzNAdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":43870,"nextInTopic":43875,"prevInTime":43870,"nextInTime":43872,"topicId":43862,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ah your are right...even when I think I ve shed most of the conventional parenting, the lingo is still there.

Courtesy is something people want to do. If you store  <br/>\ncommon courtesy in the same box as imposed requirements, it&#39;s easy to  <br/>\nslip into reacting to them with the most common understanding of the  <br/>\nword rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe environment around rules is about power, authority and obedience.  <br/>\nOnce someone has seen enough &quot;forgetting&quot; (real or feigned) it&#39;s  <br/>\ntreated the same as rule breaking. Someone&#39;s desire to follow the rule  <br/>\nor break it is irrelevant because the goal is obedience not getting  <br/>\npeople to want to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if we trust kids want to be kind, then it&#39;s easier to see their  <br/>\nslips as either mistakes or they don&#39;t yet have the ability to do it  <br/>\non their own and need help. We don&#39;t need rules, then. We have  <br/>\naccepted truths or natural limitations and the goal is creative ways  <br/>\nto meet needs within those boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why the single word reminder when a kid forgets works better  <br/>\nthan an explanation or punishment. Kids naturally want to not hurt  <br/>\npeople and things. What gives parents the idea that kids are selfish  <br/>\nand don&#39;t care is that conventional parenting is rife with disrespect  <br/>\nfor kids. And it isn&#39;t until someone is immersed in the discussions of  <br/>\nhow to live respectfully with kids that how much of conventional  <br/>\nparenting is disrespectful. It&#39;s chock full of practices that an adult  <br/>\nwould never do to another adult they cared about because they&#39;d know  <br/>\nit would damage the relationship. But the practices are accepted as  <br/>\nnecessary to raise kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t until someone steps well back from conventional parenting  <br/>\nthat they can see the disrespect and how senseless it is to expect  <br/>\nkids to not react negatively. The focus of conventional parenting is  <br/>\nmolding the child into who the parent believes they should be. In the  <br/>\nbest parents the molding is subtle stuff, like getting the child to  <br/>\nrespond politely, stick with a task, not hit and so on. But from the  <br/>\nchild&#39;s point of view it&#39;s not different than if a husband were  <br/>\nconstantly nudging his wife to be &quot;better&quot;, eg, more in keeping with  <br/>\nhis ideal of what a wife should be rather than honoring her for who  <br/>\nshe is and trusting she wants to be the best she can be.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unschooling the focus is on accepting that kids want to do their  <br/>\nbest and if they&#39;re hurting someone it&#39;s because they need help. Not  <br/>\nlectures to be told what&#39;s right. But help. The solution might be  <br/>\nremoving the child from the situation until they&#39;re old enough. (Like  <br/>\nstaying away from the street until a child can understand the dangers  <br/>\nof moving cars.) It might be mom doing whatever it is until the child  <br/>\ncan do it. (Like saying thank you until the child is ready.) It might  <br/>\nmean removing the privilege of staying up late until a child can  <br/>\nconsistently allow others to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat last is a bit confusing! It sounds like conventional rule based  <br/>\nparenting but it will feel different to an unschooled child. An  <br/>\nunschooled child knows mom and dad are on his team and will help him  <br/>\nfind ways for him to meet his needs. An unschooled child feels  <br/>\nrespected for who he is and trusted that he wants to be kind and  <br/>\nrespectful. (Not the fake respect of conventional parenting given when  <br/>\na child is conforming to a parent&#39;s expectations.) Those two factors  <br/>\nmake &quot;If you want to stay up you need to be quiet&quot; come across as a  <br/>\ntrust with a new responsibility rather than being given an entitled  <br/>\nfreedom that the parent might jerk back when the parent is angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat shift in feel doesn&#39;t come instantly! ;-) After 10 years of  <br/>\ncontrol, a parent can&#39;t just tell a child they respect and trust them  <br/>\nand not expect the child to think &quot;Whoo! Freedom! I&#39;m the boss now! I  <br/>\ncan do anything I want!&quot; That child is far less likely to respect  <br/>\nothers&#39; feelings because his have been trampled on for the parents&#39;  <br/>\nconvenience.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] re: unschooling and bed times","postDate":"1273098796","msgId":43866,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEIzNzI1NUYyLUYzNEEtNEFGQi05OURELUE4MDVDRDM3QzNDMkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDM2MDc5MS41MzMyNy5xbUB3ZWI1MjEwMi5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDM2MDc5MS41MzMyNy5xbUB3ZWI1MjEwMi5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43865,"nextInTopic":43870,"prevInTime":43865,"nextInTime":43867,"topicId":43862,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The  <br/>\nneed for the breadwinner to get a solid night&#39;s sleep trumps noisy fun  <br/>\nat 2AM.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our son is now 14, so my husband and I allow him to stay up after we<br/>\n&gt; go to bed if he wants to occasionally but the modem for the internet<br/>\n&gt; is turned off.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What if your husband decided you could stay up an hour after he did to  <br/>\nread, but you couldn&#39;t listen to music even with headphones? Would it  <br/>\nfeel trusting and respectful? Would it feel loving? Would it feel like  <br/>\none of his joys in life was you enjoying yourself?

It&#39;s all about making raising kids more convenient.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut kids aren&#39;t convenient. They have needs that often inconvenience  <br/>\nus. Using our power to make someone more convenient -- child, partner,  <br/>\nfriend -- doesn&#39;t build a stronger relationship with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list is geared to providing advice that will help parents build  <br/>\nbetter relationships with their kids. Becoming a child&#39;s partner has  <br/>\nits stumbling blocks, mainly because other than radical unschoolers,  <br/>\nthere aren&#39;t good models to grow an understanding from and build from.  <br/>\nMost people try to build from the conventional models of parent child  <br/>\nrelationships they are familiar with and partnership and authoritarian  <br/>\ndon&#39;t fit well together.<br/>\n<br/>\nRadical unschooling does need a huge shift in perspective. It requires  <br/>\nquestioning and letting go of a lot of ideas that people are certain  <br/>\nare necessary to raise children successfully. It often means creating  <br/>\nmore inconvenience for us. But in the long run, the benefits in the  <br/>\nrelationship are huge. For unschoolers it&#39;s not chance to end up with  <br/>\nteens that trust and like their parents. It grows naturally from  <br/>\ntrusting them and respecting them from an early age.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a full on radical unschooler isn&#39;t a requirement for membership  <br/>\non the list. But for those who&#39;ve joined for the purpose the list is  <br/>\naimed at, the advice needs to help them let go of and move beyond  <br/>\nconventional practices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad what you&#39;re doing is working for you. I think with most  <br/>\napproaches that someone wouldn&#39;t use on a friend or a partner, it&#39;s  <br/>\nlikely to decrease trust, make the child feel his needs are only  <br/>\nimportant when the parent agrees with them and indulged and begrudged  <br/>\nother times. Maybe this one thing is the only rule you have and the  <br/>\nrest of your hours are about supporting his needs however you can. One  <br/>\nrule is not likely to chip at the relationship. But if there are other  <br/>\nareas you&#39;ve drawn a line you don&#39;t feel comfortable for him to cross,  <br/>\neach will chip a bit more. As independence pulls at him as he gets  <br/>\nolder, even as soon as 16, you might feel the strain and him pulling  <br/>\naway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it won&#39;t happen. Some kids are compliant. Some kids feel  <br/>\ncomforted by rules that set how their world works. I was that way.

You don&#39;t trust him much do you?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have three kids, two boys 13, and 11 and a daughter age 5 (mentally she&#39;s<br/>\nabout 3)  She&#39;s the only one with a bed time but that&#39;s because she asks to<br/>\ngo to bed.  Often we keep her up later than she&#39;d like because she&#39;d rather<br/>\nbe on 5pm to 5am schedule and I don&#39;t want to be up that early.  But the<br/>\nboys go to bed whenever they want.  Occasionally that means they stay up all<br/>\nnight or until something kind of stupid like 6am!  LOL but if it&#39;s what they<br/>\nneed they know it.  And then they sleep until they get up.  The only rule we<br/>\nhave re: sleep is that if they want to be up all night that&#39;s fine but when<br/>\nsister goes to bed at 8:30-9pm and we go to bed 9-10 pm then any bickering<br/>\nthey want to do better be quiet bickering.  NO YELLING.  That&#39;s it.  And<br/>\nthat&#39;s just common courtesy.  I return the courtesy by not running the dyson<br/>\nwhile they sleep etc.  But the rule isn&#39;t meant to control them just allow<br/>\nthose of us who need sleep to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour &quot;study&quot; of unschooling...mind elaborating on the research design and<br/>\nreliability and validity?  What external and internal threats did you find<br/>\nand adjust for?  Can I read it somewhere because to the best of my knowledge<br/>\nthere aren&#39;t studies on unschooling published anywhere.
