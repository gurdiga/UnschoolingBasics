Like when you&#39;re all in the car together.  <br/>\nAsk them about being energetic with each other and what *they* think  <br/>\nabout it. And what solutions they might come up with. Listen without  <br/>\ninterjecting much. Helping them play around with ideas and problem  <br/>\nsolve is a much more useful life skill than getting them to release  <br/>\nenergy for a single day&#39;s more peaceful evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: computers and activity","postDate":"1264771069","msgId":43091,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NkRFQUUyQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":43084,"nextInTopic":43093,"prevInTime":43090,"nextInTime":43092,"topicId":43081,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... mini-trampoline, sit on an exercise ball, that sort of thing.

Is there a time they all tend to get sick of the computer at once? If so, maybe you can plan some high-energy fun to happen around that time - actively look for something they can do to work off some of that pent up energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, look for ways for them to get some action while playing - either encourage them to do something physical while something is loading (and by encourage I mean offer to do something fun *with* them, right that second) and/or look for things they can do while also playing: jump on a mini-trampoline, sit on an exercise ball, that sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince part of the trouble is being stuck inside, look for big-body toys to bring into the house - you might need to rotate them if, like me, you don&#39;t have much space! But you could have a sit-n-spin availabale, a big ball with a handle for bouncing (or an exercise ball), balloons, a small slide, a chin-up bar, a rope swing, a skateboard (sit on it and scoot around the floor), a punching bag, a tunnel, I even had a small slide at one point! Like I said, you might have to have just one or two things available and rotate as they get stale. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":334199134,"authorName":"Chrissy","from":"&quot;Chrissy&quot; &lt;EquinoxAutumn@...&gt;","profile":"equinox_autumn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"computers and activity","postDate":"1264602250","msgId":43081,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhqcGlhYSsxMDlwZkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43084,"prevInTime":43080,"nextInTime":43082,"topicId":43081,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My boys are totally into using the computer all day long and i am ok with that but at the end of the day the boys all go NUTS!! they run around and scream and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-278315585\">My boys are totally into using the computer all day long and i am ok with that but at the end of the day the boys all go NUTS!! they run around and scream and jump on each other and can&#39;t control themselves to the point where they are all getting hurt and angry with eachother.  they need to get some activity during the day but i don&#39;t want to tell them they have to turn off the computer and jump for a while.  i suggest they take a break and play.  i pull out games that involve physical activity that they love and they say &quot;YEA! let&#39;s play LATER!&quot;  i know a lot of this is because it&#39;s winter in northern ohio and it will get better in the spring but what to do until then?  any suggestions? <br/>\n<br/>\npeace, <br/>\nchrissy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43024,"nextTopicId":43126}}
