All she has to do give me<br/>\nany clue she is not interested and the game will change or stop.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think all of your activities sound entirely &quot;strictly unschooling&quot;<br/>\nactually, and truly delightful.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;If a preschooler is having fun learning history on their level, then that<br/>\ntoo can be an educational game and unschooling.<br/>\nOf course, to *ME* a preschooler&#39;s goal is to play and have fun, not do<br/>\nschool.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy impression of the other poster was that *her goals* were what was<br/>\nimportant, and she was going to do all she could to make *her goals*<br/>\ncontinue to be fun and enjoyable for her kids. That&#39;s fine, but it is not<br/>\nunschooling. She has a prearranged timetable for commencing American<br/>\nHistory. That is not unschooling. If the kid is interested in Am. History,<br/>\nlet her start at once in some way. If the kid has not expressed any<br/>\ninterest....well don&#39;t have a plan tied to a date in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn unschooling the phrase &quot;she may NEVER become interested in American<br/>\nHistory&quot; is not terrifying, nor a reason to institute controls over the<br/>\nkid&#39;s education.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;However, any parent who talks w their child naturally teaches their kid<br/>\nlanguage and about the world.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a recent thread about then idea of &quot;teach&quot; as a verb, or maybe I&#39;m<br/>\nthinking of Sandra&#39;s essay on the subject ( www.sandradodd.com ). It doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhelp people to keep that in their mind as how they are interacting with<br/>\ntheir children, IF they are trying to become unschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI liken it a bit to when you have a food sensitivity and you are on an<br/>\nelimination diet. You have to get rid of *all* the dangerous food for a<br/>\nperiod of time (in this case schoolish language) to become desensitized.<br/>\nEventually you are able to reintroduce limited amounts of the food without<br/>\nit causing a reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;How many squares and triangles have you counted w delight as you walked<br/>\ndown the road w your three year old?   :-)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNone. I actually don&#39;t remember how Jayn learnt all her shapes, but she did.<br/>\nI only counted for Jayn when she asked how many of whatever there was in<br/>\nfront of her. There is a world of difference between &quot;Jayn learnt&quot; and &quot;I<br/>\ntaught Jayn&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Educational ops are everywhere.  Why should we as unschoolers not raise a<br/>\nquestion or two?  Isn&#39;t that part of a daily exchange?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way you are speaking of the idea of strewing. However I like to live as<br/>\nthough *life* opportunities are everywhere and Jayn will learn what she<br/>\nneeds - both skills and facts - to engage in the activities that interest<br/>\nher. Joyce (Fetteroll) once wrote that in unschooling &quot;education happens as<br/>\na side effect&quot;. This isn&#39;t necessarily a &quot;Basic&quot; concept. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are raising questions because you want to know the answer, or notice<br/>\nsomething your child might be interested in but hasn&#39;t spotted, or have a<br/>\nshared interest that you are both exploring, the dynamic of the question<br/>\nraising is different from raising a question in order to subtly or covertly<br/>\ndirect your child&#39;s attention or experience, with some goal of your own in<br/>\nmind. Goals that might include ensuring your child covers a topic fully, or<br/>\ngets a well rounded education. These put the standards of success into a<br/>\nschoolish framework. See how easy it can be to slide back into schoolish<br/>\nthinking if you are not vigilant. (I&#39;m NOT suggesting that you are doing any<br/>\nof that stuff, Dail!)   <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Unschooling is not unlearning and it is not only one way.  It can be very<br/>\nparent hands on.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is unlearning all the bad habits and language we all had ingrained into<br/>\nus over the 12+ years of education most of us had - good or bad as the<br/>\nexperience may have felt at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are practices that are not unschooling, however. If the way you are<br/>\nengaging with your child is not unschooling, it harms all of us, especially<br/>\nthose struggling to change, if people who are &quot;Relaxed&quot; or &quot;Eclectic&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;Unit-Studies&quot; homeschoolers are complacently calling themselves<br/>\nunschoolers. No-one can control how a family wishes to label their<br/>\nhomeschooling style in the wider world. However on a list devoted to<br/>\nunschooling I will continue to protest when the activities described and,<br/>\nmore importantly, the language used is not unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is *more* parents&#39; hands-on - because it is entirely<br/>\nunpredictable. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I think you can have fun learning right alongside your kid and not direct<br/>\nwhere/ when/ how it is they will proceed.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat poster was talking about her intentions to continue to direct the<br/>\nteaching of her children. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
