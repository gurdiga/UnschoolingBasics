He’s authored several books criticizing institutionalized schooling, including the highly popular Dumbing Us Down; The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling (1992), a must-read for home educators; The Underground History of American Education (2001), Gatto&#39;s opus; and his newest book, Weapons of Mass Instruction (2008), a shocking look at how and why the mechanisms of compulsory schooling cripple imagination and discourage critical thinking. One professor of education has called his books &quot;scathing&quot; and &quot;one-sided and hyperbolic, [but] not inaccurate.” <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nGatto&#39;s office is in New York City, his home in Oxford, New York, where he is currently at work on a documentary film about the nature of modern schooling entitled The Fourth Purpose, with his friend and former student, Roland Legiardi-Laura. Gatto has been married for forty years to the same woman, and has two grown children and a cat. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n* Please note – Gatto’s Keynote Address, as well as all other UWWG events, are open only to registered UWWG attendees. You must have a wristband to enter. <br/>\n<br/>\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <br/>\n<br/>\nJoin us!
