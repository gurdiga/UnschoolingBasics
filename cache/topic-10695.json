She is<br/>\npretty nit-picky (though I give her some grace because she has 3 kids and<br/>\ndoes this alone... the ex is in another state) and more controling.  I even<br/>\nthink she still spanks.... eekkk.  We just don&#39;t make our parenting styles<br/>\nan issue in our friendship.  She knows I don&#39;t think spanking is Biblical...<br/>\n and I&#39;ve even said to her... &quot;man, our parenting styles are so different.&quot;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBut I&#39;ve never told her she should or shouldn&#39;t do something with her kids<br/>\nand she&#39;s never done that to me.  That&#39;s respect and love at it&#39;s finest. <br/>\nWhen two people can be great friends because of their common values and<br/>\ninterests and look past the differences.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLesa\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n-------Original Message-------\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nFrom: Ren Allen\r<br/>\nDate: 03/12/06 10:36:58\r<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] safety issues\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI have friends that don&#39;t unschool, some that unschool but control\r<br/>\nseveral things we don&#39;t, I never felt like it was my place to tell\r<br/>\nthem how to do things unless they asked. I do share bits and pieces\r<br/>\nwhen appropriate of course.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLast week a Mom commented that she doesn&#39;t allow violent video games\r<br/>\nin their home and I said &quot;we don&#39;t control our children&#39;s choices&quot;.\r<br/>\nI told her what WE did, not what SHE should do.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI think one important aspect of unschooling/learning/life is learning\r<br/>\nthat other people have different boundaries and sensitivities than we\r<br/>\ndo and how to respect that.  Going into someone elses home, or car\r<br/>\nmeans some things will be different than in our own home...unschooler\r<br/>\nor not.\r<br/>\nIf she&#39;s modeling to her child, that THEIR values should be imposed on\r<br/>\nother people wherever they go, that&#39;s not a great skill at getting\r<br/>\nalong in this life.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRen\r<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS Secondary school education Graduate school education Home<br/>\nschool education \r<br/>\nGraduate school education online High school education Chicago school<br/>\neducation \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYAHOO!
