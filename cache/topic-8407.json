I have been reading about unschooling for at least 4 years,<br/>\nbeen off and on various lists.  This is our first year at home, although<br/>\nI&#39;ve been planning to be home for quite some time.  Previously, I was a<br/>\nprivate school teacher and my kids attended the school I taught at.  My kids<br/>\nare 15, 10 and 6, all boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgainst my initial better judgment I signed them all up for the charter<br/>\nschool that I work for (working from home now).  The 15 y.o. absolutely<br/>\nhated it so I withdrew him after the first quarter.  He will take a couple<br/>\njr. college classes starting in January and for now is mostly doing nothing<br/>\n(although I want to prep him a little bit for the placement test).<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the younger two I have been like a multiple personality freak.  The<br/>\nfirst quarter we did the charter curriculum by the book.  They did fine, but<br/>\nI hated it because it is so schoolish that it goes against everything I<br/>\nbelieve about teaching and learning.  Then I decided to forget the<br/>\ncurriculum and unschool.  They loved the concept, especially my 10 year old<br/>\nwho decided everything he was doing for fun was learning (picked up on that<br/>\npretty dang fast).  Then after a couple weeks of that I freaked out about<br/>\nall the curriculum they were not doing (and the fact that I didn&#39;t discuss<br/>\nany of this with my husband and he assumed they were still doing the<br/>\n&quot;school&quot;work) and decided to do a relaxed form of the curriculum.

They loved the concept, especially my 10 year old<br/>\nwho decided everything he was doing for fun was learning (picked up on that<br/>\npretty dang fast).  Then after a couple weeks of that I freaked out about<br/>\nall the curriculum they were not doing (and the fact that I didn�t discuss<br/>\nany of this with my husband and he assumed they were still doing the<br/>\n�school�work) and decided to do a relaxed form of the curriculum.  We did<br/>\nthat temporarily, and the kids were not thrilled, so I went back to<br/>\nunschooling mode.  Then back to curriculum mode.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am a basket case, lol.  I�m not sure how to make a decision and stick to<br/>\nit one way or the other, and how to know that I�m not� I don�t know, not<br/>\nallowing my kids to live up to their full potential.  That�s a ridiculous<br/>\nstatement in one sense because it has always been so obvious to me that the<br/>\namazing and wonderful things that they do and know are almost invariably<br/>\nthings they learned and discovered on their own and not from school or from<br/>\ncurriculum.  On the other hand� there isn�t really another hand.  I think my<br/>\nbig fear/guilt is that *other people* will judge them and will not see their<br/>\ntrue brilliance (mommy pride) the way I do.  I was always<br/>\nacknowledged/praised/noticed for my intellect and achievement in schoolish<br/>\nthings� I don�t want that to be their identity but I do want them to be seen<br/>\nas intelligent and well-rounded.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any words of advice for me before I make my kids insane with my<br/>\nwishywashyness?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n~Q~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>\nVersion: 7.1.371 / Virus Database: 267.13.13/200 - Release Date: 12/14/2005<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8383,"nextTopicId":8416}}
