And you don&#39;t need to give up your right to sleep for his right to choose to stay awake. It&#39;s all about balance. You need to balance  his freedom of choice  and the needs of other members of the household. Plus you must take into account his age and level of understanding and empathy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe never had an enforced &quot;bedtime&quot; when my kids were 5. I didn&#39;t send them to bed just because it was 8:00. But I would certainly help them to bed when it seemed the time was right-when they seemed tired or I would soon be too tired to help them. That was just part of our gentle routine. So they were used to me talking about when we were going to bed, did they want help getting into their jammies, etc. That usually resulted in happily getting to bed before 9 or 10. Now that they&#39;re older (11 and 16) they stay up till whenever and handle it all on their own. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur children shouldn&#39;t be making their choices without consideration for the other people in the house. Some of that understanding comes with age. So you could remove the &quot;you must be in bed by 8:00&quot; part while still not leaving it open for him to challenge himself to stay awake as late as he can. We had routines instead of rules and that seemed to work very well.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water.

One is to lift off constraints and allow <br/>\nhim to make his own decisions.  He now wants to stay up very late <br/>\neither watching movies or playing on the computer.  I explained that <br/>\nhe could make that choice but I needed to go to bed.  He said he was <br/>\nafraid to be alone.  We went back and forth with our seemingly <br/>\nconflicting needs.  The first night I read in his bed next to the <br/>\nroom where he watches TV.  Later I told him I was tired and he was <br/>\nwilling put out the light so I could sleep and went back to his <br/>\nmovie.  When he was ready he woke me up and we went back to the <br/>\nfamily bed where my husband was already sleeping. I was pretty <br/>\ndelighted at that point.  The second night he wanted to play the <br/>\ncomputer after his first movie.  I got up put on the computer.  The <br/>\nrepetition of the noise on the computer made it hard for me to relax <br/>\nand fall asleep.  I got up and explained that to him, we decided to <br/>\nturn down the volume really low.  At around 11:30, I thought to <br/>\nmyself, why am I doing this?  He is free and now I am trapped!!  I <br/>\nam in his bed so he can stay up, I can&#39;t sleep and I am tired!  But <br/>\nstill trying to allow him more freedom I decided to delay my needs <br/>\nand give it some more time.  Last night I explained that the <br/>\ncomputer noise made it hard for me to sleep.  So he decided that he <br/>\nwanted to watch two movies again.  When I explained that I can&#39;t <br/>\nstay up he begs me to watch them with him.  He tells me he is afraid <br/>\nto be alone.  (I do know that he is afraid of the dark sometimes <br/>\neven when I am lying down next to him.)  Then I feel bad.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to overburden him with my illness but I do have MS and I really <br/>\ndo need to get enough sleep.  My dh is willing to allow me to try <br/>\nunschooling but he is not going to be willing to sit up with him <br/>\nevery night until midnight either.  How can we give him choices <br/>\nwhile still taking care of ourselves? At the rate we are going I am <br/>\ngetting pretty tired, pretty quickly.  This level of fatigue then <br/>\ncompromises my mood the next day and I feel much crankier.  Joanne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7003,"nextTopicId":7090}}
