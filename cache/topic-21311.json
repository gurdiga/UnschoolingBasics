When we were active, each member participated as much or as little as they felt comfortable with. The uniform was used only for those who choose to compete in our 1 time a year Spring Show and simply was whites, white jeans, white shirt a green bandana and hat, or club colors, a green T-shirt. 4-H offers a wide variety of activities and our region, Yolo County, offers hunting to 10 and up. Also, the clubs will take any willing adult to lead most any project, so you could become a leader for hiking and arrange hiking trips 1 time a month with and for your son. The leadership through 4-H is fantastic and writing this post makes me realize how much I miss my involvement with the group. The kids run the program with adult support.<br/>\n<br/>\n Each club has its own uniqueness too, so if you have many clubs in your area, go to all of them before selecting. In our town, there are 4 local clubs, plus horse only club if you&#39;re totally into horses and most clubs offer different county wide programs, like the hunting, archery, sheep, rabbit, and quilting. These are open to kids from any club and generally meet 1 time a month for a few hours. Our club had over 30 projects for the kids to join.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":75406115,"authorName":"Beth Mouser","from":"&quot;Beth Mouser&quot; &lt;mouser4@...&gt;","profile":"mouser4983703","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Alternatives to Boy Scouts?","postDate":"1171002221","msgId":21311,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVxaDQxZCtydWV2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21330,"prevInTime":21310,"nextInTime":21312,"topicId":21311,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My soon to be 13-YO says he misses some aspects of Boy Scouts, since he quit last year.

He loved the camp-outs, but didn&#39;t like dressing up in <br/>\nthe uniform each week.  He has Asperger&#39;s and things like getting the <br/>\nuniform just right stresses him out.  He also didn&#39;t like having to be <br/>\nthere each Monday and said it was too often.  Further, he said trying <br/>\nto earn the badges stressed him as well.     <br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking that a once-a-month hiking club would work good for <br/>\nhim...some sort of outdoor club.  Does anybody have any ideas?  He does <br/>\nwant to go hunting very badly and his dad and I do not hunt.  I was <br/>\nhoping there was some sort of club for that as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help,<br/>\nBeth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21403,"nextTopicId":21418}}
