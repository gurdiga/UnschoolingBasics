We chose to unschool,<br/>\nbecause it was what felt right for us, and our<br/>\nlifestyle.  We are still in the deschooling process.<br/>\n(all 4 of us, my ds, dd, dh, and I).  It is still a<br/>\nbig adjustment.  I am loving this, because there is no<br/>\nschool work, only learning the natural way.  We have<br/>\ndone some  gardening, cooking, reading, watching lots<br/>\nof movies, listening to music, and playing video<br/>\ngames.  We are relaxing, and loving it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough sometimes my kids like their space, and need<br/>\nalone time (which I totally understand), we are doing<br/>\njust about everything together, except for dishes,<br/>\nlaundry, etc. LOL.  I am finding that I am learning<br/>\nright along with them.  For our gardening, we dug up<br/>\nour hostas, and discovered they have hard roots to dig<br/>\nout, and that we don&#39;t want to have any more in the<br/>\nflower garden. (the hostas were here, when we moved<br/>\nin.).  We&#39;ve also went for lots of walks, and trips to<br/>\nthe store.  We&#39;ve done grocery shopping, and just<br/>\nwindow shopping.  They know that money is tight, and<br/>\nwe can&#39;t afford alot of extra&#39;s right now, but it&#39;s<br/>\nfun to look and see what is new.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust learning to relax was hard for me.  It&#39;s hard<br/>\nletting go of the PS life.  My kids were in 3rd and<br/>\n4th grade when we pulled them out, at the end of the<br/>\nyear.  Since then, we have been exploring what life is<br/>\nlike, and to learn life lessons, as we go.  We did go<br/>\nto the air zoo at the end of last month, and we<br/>\ndiscovered that we didn&#39;t like it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry this is so long, but learning is easier, if<br/>\nthere is no restrictions, and they are free to pick<br/>\nsubjects that they really are interested in.

When I pulled my girls out of public school I decided that I was not going to recreate school at home.  I&#39;m taking the lead from them.  One of my daughters I could not get to read for nothing when she was in public school.......she was struggling and considered behind in reading, and a number of other areas.  Well she read two chapter books out loud to her Grandma this week because she wanted to, not because anyone asked her to.  When she was in public school we had nightly tears over Math.  Now she asks me to do Math worksheets, and all on her own because she wants to.......not because I or PS wants her to.  Life is so much nicer now, and so much less stress.
