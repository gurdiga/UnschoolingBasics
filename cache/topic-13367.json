","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-501713320\">An additional idea -<br/>\n<br/>\nA mom in our little unschooling group who has 3 kids under six regularly <br/>\nhires my 13yo daughter to come do the art thing with her kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had found herself dreading the mess nearly to the point of never letting <br/>\nthem do anything, and feeling that perhaps she should send the oldest to <br/>\nschool so she&#39;d get to be creative. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids look forward to having Sarah over, Sarah loves the kids and the art <br/>\nand doesn&#39;t mind cleaning the mess (probably because it&#39;s the only mess she&#39;ll <br/>\ndeal with that day.) She&#39;s been there for painting, chalk drawings, play <br/>\ndough, collage, and helped the kids make garden stepping stones for their <br/>\ngrandmother at Christmas time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s win/win/win. The kids are joyously creative, mom is able to be serene <br/>\nabout it all, and my daughter earns a decent amount of cash AND gets to enjoy <br/>\ncreative time with younger kids she adores. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13209,"nextTopicId":13372}}
