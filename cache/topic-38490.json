Another helpful thing is stuff like refillable cards<br/>\n(like for Starbucks) and gift cards - DS loves Visa gift cards because<br/>\nhe can use them anywhere for anything that I&#39;d use a Visa card for. He<br/>\nknows that if he spends on A, he won&#39;t have money for B and so on. Gives<br/>\nhim a sense of &#39;plastic&#39; as having real monetary value, not just cash.<br/>\nHe was about 5 or 6 when he walked into Best Buy with over $100 in gift<br/>\ncards (after Christmas), had me write a list of things he thought looked<br/>\ncool (item, price, any other notes he wanted added)...then we walked out<br/>\nto the car, sat down, juggled the list as he chose, then walked back in<br/>\nand bought the top ONE item for about $20-$30 and left (his choice, he<br/>\njust wanted that one thing right then, the rest could wait). Over the<br/>\nnext 6 months or so, we went here and there picking up the items from<br/>\nhis list or new items that bumped the others in priority. He has a cash<br/>\nallowance paid twice per month when I get paid so he knows that cash<br/>\ngoes out to pay for goods and services and he chooses how that gets<br/>\nspent. (He&#39;s had an allowance since he was about 5 or so, he&#39;s almost 11<br/>\nnow). He does like it when we pay cash if we&#39;re at a restaurant because<br/>\nit&#39;s faster to get done and out.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

It created a lot of hostility. Though things are improving now we had to come clean with them. They understood why we had to say no sometimes and also appreciate what we can do for them a lot more. We sit and discuss our budget openly and include them so that if there is something special that they want to do or even just an everyday thing they want, they can see that we might have to save up for it or might have to wait for another paycheck before it happens. But they get to help decide where some of the money goes and how important it is that we work as a family to achieve our goals. They come to us and say that they want to do X, do we have it in the budget to do so. So we sit down and look over the spread sheet and see if we can swing it or not. Happily these days we can swing a lot more. It also helped our stress levels not to have to hide it from them. They are sharing in the<br/>\n joy of being able to relax and see that we aren&#39;t struggling to get by anymore. But during tight times they learned a lot of ways to be frugal and how to plan for emergencies. Besides money math seems to be a whole lot more interesting the regular math drills anyway. It means we can go shopping!!

She would say this with such intensity and sincerity that I grew to fear money and the consequences of not having it.  It wasn&#39;t until I was in college that I learned that my father made almost 6 figures at a time when that was considered VERY high income.  Boy, was I resentful at the way we had been treated and misled. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRecently my father retired, as I mentioned in a previous post, to come work for my husband, and he is making less than half of what he has ever made.  He is excited and happy about his position, however, my mother has started up with her &quot;I don&#39;t want to be living under a bridge&quot; speech again.  We are not rich, but we could certainly provide for her if something ever happened.  I am amazed at how people do not like to talk about money.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI talk about it with just about anyone that asks me because it no longer controls me.  My husband&#39;s income took a 30% cut because of the economy, so we sat down with my 8 and 5 yo and asked them what their priorities were for this year, although I understood they could change.  Then I told them that daddy and I would do our very best to make sure that we budgeted money for the things that were important to them, but would have to make some concessions if money got tighter.  They were great.  My oldest said he didn&#39;t really like baseball and would rather just hit some balls in the park than to play on an organized team, but he would rather not give up art.  My 5 yo said that he could wait until his birthday to get more Wii games.  None of this was forced or coerced, just a discussion about reality without making them scared.  Plus, they don&#39;t resent it when I tell them we don&#39;t have the money.  They understand and even volunteer to use their own if they want it bad enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to be able to say yes to their every interest or desire, but with four children, that isn&#39;t financially possible.  We have our personal goals, too, that we choose to save for, and we inform the kids about those decisions, too.  My husband even showed our 8 yo the stock market and all the money we had invested, how much it had lost, and what the predictions are for a 30 year investment.  He didn&#39;t frighten him in any way about the losses, just matter-of-fact information and hope for the future of our financial stability.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that most people don&#39;t talk about money with their kids because they are barely getting by and don&#39;t want their kids to realize that.  They want their kids to see them as truly financially successful, which is what gets our children in trouble later, because they have never seen someone struggle financially and then are embarassed to admit that they made mistakes.  We talk about our mistakes (many!!) and also our successes.  It is a balance and I feel children can handle more than we give them, especially if we do it in a non-threatening way.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather - PS - I try to pay cash for everything I can, when possible, so that my children see the reality of the cash going out of my wallet over the counter to pay for the goods or services.  I think it gives them a better grasp on money, rather than just charging everything.

The kids, who were 11 & 13 <br/>\nat the time, immediately offered up ways they could help us conserve funds until Dad got <br/>\na new job.  They really wanted to help any way they could (my son even offered to sell his <br/>\ngaming systems, which we declined).   <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a Family Plan helped us feel more in control of our situation.
