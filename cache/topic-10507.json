It&#39;s good to know<br/>\nthat I&#39;m not alone in feeling like I&#39;m trying but not as good as other<br/>\nfamilies. And thanks for the reminder that overall that the respectful<br/>\nattitude is the most important.  I guess I just have to be patient<br/>\nwith myself ( ha-so hard for me :) but I am doing better  than I was<br/>\n18 months ago.  I am doing most the things you suggested, so that made<br/>\nme feel better.  I just need to keep my sense of humor and not take it<br/>\npersonally I guess.  I liked what you said about helping the girls<br/>\ntell whether what they are saying is helpful or hurtful and whether it<br/>\nwill help them get along better. I love &quot;Raising Your Spirited Child&quot;<br/>\n (I have 3 out of 4, plus myself)  and I just reread the adaptibility<br/>\npart.  I think I need to work on somehow having some predictability<br/>\nfor Nate without having a rigid schedule.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa, thanks for the hug!   Ah you overwelmed me with the 7 kids ;)<br/>\n It&#39;s so funny, you always hear about &quot;taking a deep breath&quot; but it&#39;s<br/>\nonly recently that I realized how helpful it really is.  I get really<br/>\ntense trying to rush places and the extra oxygen really does relax you<br/>\nand then the kids start laughing at their mom making big gasping<br/>\nnoises and everybody feels better.  Ah soooo true about not being able<br/>\nto fix things, but to just listen.  I don&#39;t really talk to my mom<br/>\nbecause she tries to fix things and I get mad because I done<br/>\neverything that can be done;  I just wanted to hear,&quot; yeah that really<br/>\nsucks&quot;.  Duh!  That&#39;s what my kids want too!  I just have to remember<br/>\nthat. <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren, thanks for the hugs and some back at ya!  Oh you are so right,<br/>\nNic doesn&#39;t get included in with his sisters and he isn&#39;t the cute<br/>\n&quot;baby&quot; and yeah I guess that I would be pissed too.  I really do need<br/>\nto have more &quot;dates&quot; with the kids, one on one, especially him.  Later<br/>\nthat day he came to me and asked for a hug, and then that night just<br/>\nhe & I snuggled up to watch TV together.  It&#39;s so nice to have this<br/>\nlist and hear &quot;give them more time & love&quot; instead of &quot;be stricter,<br/>\nlay down the law&quot;.  And thank you for saying I&#39;m a good mom, that<br/>\nmeans so much more coming from an unschooling mom :) <br/>\n<br/>\nPatti, I do need to do better about warning Nate about transistions. <br/>\nI have used the &quot;5 more minutes&quot; but I don&#39;t think it was concrete for<br/>\nhim (especially if sometimes mom gets talking and it turns into 20)  I<br/>\nwas thinking about finding some kind of timer that is just his that he<br/>\ncould actually see how much time was left?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!

I<br/>\nhave 4 sweet, challenging, & wonderful kids, but I feel like I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how to put it into practice, and that I&#39;m doing an awful job of<br/>\nit.  I hate to even admit that we are unschoolers because I&#39;m not a<br/>\ngood example of it.  I feel like we are bad proof of why you should<br/>\nuse &quot;typical&quot; parenting.   Ok, that&#39;s not true, I do get comments on<br/>\nhow sweet my kids are,  just not in the middle of one of their<br/>\nscreaming episodes ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, today the kids had swim lessons.  I usually lap swim<br/>\nwhile the oldest 3 have lessons and the 4 year old goes to the kids<br/>\ngym. On the way I listened while the girls fought and said what they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t like about each other.  I didn&#39;t know what to say.   I think it<br/>\nwas good that they were talking about what made each other mad, but I<br/>\nfelt like they didn&#39;t think I cared or was listening because I didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow what to say. Then Nic (6) & Nate (4) didn&#39;t want to go,  so I<br/>\nsaid we could hang out in waiting room while the girls swam.  Nate<br/>\ncries & screams everytime we go anywhere if he doesn&#39;t &quot;win&quot;, even<br/>\nthough we all try to let him win and don&#39;t even bring up racing or<br/>\nwinning or anything. He also cries & screams  ALOT every day and we<br/>\nall try everything to make him happy and don&#39;t know what he wants. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what to do.  Anyways, Nate brought his trike and Nic<br/>\nbrought a toy, and they fought and screamed for most of the 1 1/2<br/>\nhours.  They did have a few sweet moments, but most of the time Nic<br/>\nkept hitting Nate on the head and they both were screaming and angry.<br/>\n I told them to use their words  and stop means stop, and tried to<br/>\ntalk to Nic and said it must be hard being the big brother and have a<br/>\nlittle brother and he said yes, I want revenge and went to hit him<br/>\nagain. I tried to distract him and have him tear up some paper  and he<br/>\npunched me in the face ( a 1st). On the way to the car, I helped Nate<br/>\nride his trike down the stairs and then Nic wanted to and I was just<br/>\nworn out and said we would do it later.  Nic screamed the whole way<br/>\nhome and then Nate joined in because his brother was being loud. <br/>\nAlexa (11) & Autumn ( 9) love to go places and do stuff, but it is so<br/>\nhard doing anything with the boys.  Nate has a really hard time with<br/>\ntransistions so it takes us 10X longer to just get in and out of a<br/>\nplace, even when we limit it to just fun places. The boys are happy at<br/>\nhome but then the girls don&#39;t think we do anything. Autumn says she<br/>\nwants to go back to school because she feels she isn&#39;t doing anything<br/>\nbut watch TV. ( Not true and she has a persuasive best friend that<br/>\nwants her back in school, but I still feel guilty).  I feel like I&#39;m<br/>\nfailing in trying to make everyone happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t expect perfect peace and harmony, I&#39;ve finally realized that<br/>\nwas an only child&#39;s wishful fantasy :).  But I wish I felt like I knew<br/>\nwhat I was doing and was better at knowing what to say.   I&#39;m able to<br/>\nstay calm with the kids, but then I go home and hide and beat myself<br/>\nup for not doing better.   Which just makes things worse and I have a<br/>\nbigger hole to dig out of. Ok, sorry for the whining, I came to get<br/>\nsome of all your wise perspectives.  Could you share some of the<br/>\n&quot;scripts&quot; you use. I would also like to make a big list of<br/>\ndistractions so my overwhelmed brain doesn&#39;t have to think.  Pam, I<br/>\nhave a nice giggle whenever I read about some of your distractions<br/>\n(loved the potato chips & eggs in the bathtub), your girls had such a<br/>\nfun childhood!  We&#39;ve been using the bathtub a lot more often, I just<br/>\nwish I could put it in my van ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nChristine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10454,"nextTopicId":10548}}
