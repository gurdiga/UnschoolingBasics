We did have a map of Germany on our wall when my nieces lived there but that was more for me, so I could find the cool places they were visiting.   I think, in many cases, maps appeal to adults more than children.   Relief maps are great for kids.  We had lots of dinosaur play on our relief map. <br/>\n<br/>\n***A nice balance scale***<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t have a balance scale but we had a kitchen scale that weighed bugs, rocks, letters, puzzle books, etc. &lt;g&gt;   We didn&#39;t have a practical use for a balance scale.<br/>\n<br/>\n***A solid brass microscope***<br/>\n<br/>\nOurs isn&#39;t solid brass but it&#39;s a good one.  We got it second hand from a vector control company that had the funding for new equipment and got rid of their old.  It&#39;s a binocular scope and the guy we got it from gave us a bunch of slides.  It was expensive to replace the lights for it when they quit, we had to get them mail order, but it&#39;s been working perfectly for the ten or eleven years we&#39;ve had it.  It lived on our dining room table for years, with egg cartons full of little things we collected to look at.   Lots of dead bugs. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n***A selection of really good music CDs of various styles***<br/>\n<br/>\nI probably wouldn&#39;t buy music nobody was interested in just to expose my kid to that style.  There&#39;s so much music online, there are music store where you can listen to different music, there are movies with soundtracks, there&#39;s theater, there&#39;s the library if somebody was really curious.    I would certainly buy music I like and that my kid likes, and we like a pretty wide variety of music here.   Dylan plays the organ and plays a lot of Baroque stuff.  He just bought a book of Gershwin music, those great old songs, and is learning some of those on the piano.  He plays church hymns. He plays Emerson Lake and Palmer stuff.   Broad range of music. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n***rosetta stone language***<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I wouldn&#39;t spend money on a language course unless someone wanted it.  We got a Japanese course for Dylan when he was interested.  He&#39;s learning Italian from a Pimsleur course right now and watching movies in Italian and watching Italian TV online.   There are a lot of ways to hear other languages without springing for a course. There are foreign language films,  foreign language TV online, music online, travel, visits to ethnic restaurants, opera...<br/>\n<br/>\nCollecting cd&#39;s or buying a language course or a balance scale could get expensive and if your kid would rather have comic books and Heelys and a laptop that would be a better use of money. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209361242,"authorName":"JJ","from":"&quot;JJ&quot; &lt;jrossedd@...&gt;","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: what would you do with 1000.00 for school ?","postDate":"1273849804","msgId":44047,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhzanA0YytoNGZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrQk1aWExNSVhrLXFJVU9yWUlURnBESms5RGhrbTJRNjB0a2Y5MEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":44046,"nextInTopic":44048,"prevInTime":44046,"nextInTime":44048,"topicId":44041,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Let me suggest it s not what you choose but why you choose it, that will most affect your unschooling path.

We read the online catalogue descriptions out loud (generally doing overly dramatic or silly voices) and sometimes order a set of dvds that sounds especially fun, from Vikings and pirates to the stories behind constellations, Broadway musical history and Shakespeare.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is important: those things were not bought with any schooling motive, or as anything resembling curriculum. We spend a lot of money each year for one-on-one coaching when either child finds the right interest and the right mentor, such as singing and dancing for the stage, bagpiping, fencing and travel. Young Son just started spending an hour a week with a retired French teacher from the IB program here, and they really seem to enjoy each other so that&#39;s what makes it worth spending the money to me, not because it is &quot;educational&quot; and might look good on a school record. We never set aside any part of our budget or daily activities or our home (either in physical or psychic space) for &quot;school.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI come from a long line of teachers and college professors, school guidance counselors and perennial students. I loved school myself growing up and worked as a school librarian, elementary school principal and even state ed department official before having children and &quot;retiring&quot; to be a fulltime mom. Most of my friends were teachers even, so managing NOT to make home into school was my biggest personal challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on all that, I guess my two cents would be not spending even two cents on anything schoolish or curriculum-based! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; On Fri, May 14, 2010 at 8:53 AM, crystal rid &lt;cryway2@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My exhusband very much values education and is more then willing to pay for it to see that they get the best education.
