I honestly do try to sit/ rest or not do too much but as we all know just the basics keep a mom busy. Ie cooking and dishes. We have food allergies and intolerances so we make most things from scratch. And no dishwasher. They used to like to do recipes with me but when hubby cooks he ends them away so not sure if that is why they aren&#39;t in the kitchen w me much anymore. I do pick up or carry my kids when they ask. I am small 100 pounds and my daughter is already 40 pounds. They like piggy back rides. I do refuse to nurse my son anymore in standing and most times insist on the rocker/recliner so I am comfortable. My husband likes the house picked up when he gets home and I find picking up all the toys exhausting.  My kids like everything out.  They are starting to help.  I have an alarm on my phone that goes off every week day at 4:45 and they now know it is clean up for papi time. So they start to help so that is good.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo clarify on pee and poop talk it goes like this: mom says what do you want for dinner? 4 year old: poop. Or she may just say I am going to poop on you. It bothers other family members like grandma aunts uncles.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe spit thing is showing me it or trying to put it on me. I honestly have tried walking away and it does not work.  I have tried to explain that others don&#39;t like it but I get the impression in her eyes she is getting in trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll if these behaviors seem do much to me a part of who she is right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has always been a high need kid. Nursed 24 -7. When she does nurse she still does not want to let go like she needs a lot of sucking time.  My Dom used to be easy but demands a lot of attention himself.  He hates sharing nursing something he has done since day 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids won&#39;t let anyone watch them but mommy or daddy.  When I bring it up my daughter immediately cries and says but then I won&#39;t have a mommy anymore.  My husband works a lot and is out of town a lot so I do it all including working 1.5-3 hours outside the home when hubby is home.  When he is home he is great at playing with them but does not have a lot of patience if they do not listen to something he asks of them. He just expects them to listen. If they don&#39;t he gets frustrated and they end up in tears.  Both my kids now say take me with when I go to work.  If I can sell the building I own that just got leased with option I may quit work next year.  I am a little nervous about that as it is my only time away.  When I am home he has grass cutting, repairs on our 110 year old home or work for his job. My husband is very stressed at work and does not get good sleep as he is a light sleeper and has trouble with his back.  So I try to help him but we are both exhausted.  He also needs more time especially intimate time than I can give him.  My son has been staying up til 11:30. Last night he crashed at 6 on no nap. We hoped it was for the night. He woke at 10:30 pm nursed to try to fall back asleep but said he was thirsty have him water I had in the room then he decided he was hungry so had to bring him downstairs. He ate but now he was awake. I was up with him for 3 hours then both kids were up by 6:20.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Sacha Davis&quot; &lt;sacha@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think being as positive and loving as possible helps deflect the<br/>\n&gt; behavior and keeps you in a good place mentally (fake it til you make it<br/>\n&gt; real?).

If the goal is building a trusting relationship with a child, it&#39;s more useful to see behavior as the child&#39;s attempt to communicate a need. The method they&#39;re choosing may not be the best, but if the mom focuses on the method, the message she&#39;s sending is &quot;First fix your wrongness, then and only then will I listen to what you want.&quot; The mom would be saying she doesn&#39;t care about the child&#39;s need. Her priority is her agenda for the child. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the mom can say &quot;Whoa, I can understand you better if you don&#39;t scream (or whine),&quot; as she focuses on figuring out what the child needs, good! Helping kids find better, more effective ways to communicate their needs, helps the child *and* helps the child be people others enjoy having around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, it sounds like the mom has been reacting negatively to the child&#39;s attempts to communicate for quite some time. It&#39;s very likely the child needs a big dose of trust that her mom does care about her and her needs before she can have any energy left over for mom&#39;s messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you couldn&#39;t communicate well, were having problems where it felt like your emotions were overwhelming your brain, and someone repeatedly just walked away, would that feel nurturing and enlightening? Would you feel closer to that person, trust that person to be there to help you no matter what?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr might you feel bereft? Or even WTF?!?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She&#39;s testing your limits and trying to learn where the boundaries are. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The fewer arbitrary limits and boundaries a parent has, the less kids have to test in order to figure out what the heck&#39;s going on, and what these weird rules mean in actual practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how we&#39;re hard wired to figure out the world: Coming up with a theory, testing, assessing what happened, adjusting the theory if need be. Repeat until the theory is matching predicted outcomes well.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of limits, instead of control, use your values as tools to help your child get what he or she wants. Be kind, be patient, be helpful,  be trustworthy. If the child experiences all those as tools that mom uses to help her get what she wants, if she experiences them as tools that make her feel warm, loved and supported, she&#39;ll see them as useful and good too. If she experiences tools as means to stop her on her path towards something she wants for a lesson she hasn&#39;t asked for they&#39;re likely to feel irritating.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Getting up and removing yourself from the situation is effective and kids get that pretty quick.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What kids appear to understand and what they really understand can be two very different things. Just because a child stops doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve had an &quot;aha!&quot; moment. Quite often it means they&#39;ve given up asking because they&#39;re convinced they&#39;ll get no help from mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuite often kids mature while mothers are trying these harsh methods and it can seem like the method worked, when really it was the child growing out of it. But in the process, the relationship has suffered some damage the mom may not even realize if she&#39;s looking at who she wants her child to be rather than directly at her child.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151505017,"authorName":"CarenKH","from":"&quot;CarenKH&quot; &lt;carenkh@...&gt;","profile":"carenkh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Struggling with behaviors that I and society dislike","postDate":"1346069675","msgId":48973,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGsxZm9iYitsYjNmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ1NzMxNThCLTU3NTgtNDdBNi05RDcwLTg2MDkwNjkxQkM3RkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":48972,"nextInTopic":48974,"prevInTime":48972,"nextInTime":48974,"topicId":48969,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~So give her more attention, more hugs, more light-hearted responses to her subject matter, more of whatever feels like love to her and see if that helps~~ To","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-905894309\">~~So give her more attention, more hugs, more light-hearted responses to her subject matter, more of whatever feels like love to her and see if that helps~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo help with the lightheartedness, I recommend &#39;Playful &#39;Parenting&#39; by Lawrence Cohen.

I&#39;m tired today and I&#39;ve had to walk away from a couple of moments because I knew I was being crabby, being impatient, being annoyed over nothing more than being tired. <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo children is more than one. Double the number. If you don&#39;t understand that you are being asked to expend twice the energy that you were when you only had one, you will end up seeing more things wrong with your daughter than really are wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: ch1qui74 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ch1qui74@...\">ch1qui74@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Monday, 27 August 2012, 11:02<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Struggling with behaviors that I and society dislike<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nHi, my oldest just turned 4.

It&#39;s possible she has a higher need for touching and your full attention than you&#39;ve been giving. And your responses feel like a rejection of her.

I&#39;d consider getting a microscope slide to take a closer look.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut and about or with others though, I&#39;d explain that some people don&#39;t like that kind of thing and it&#39;s best that she doesn&#39;t do it when others are around. The same with talking about pee and poop. Let her explore with you in a safe, fun way. <br/>\n<br/>\nTalking like a baby I&#39;d try to be patient with, or maybe see if you can make it into a game together.<br/>\n<br/>\nReaching in your shirt I would tell her not to do that please, and think of a secret &#39;code&#39; together that she can do if she wants to nurse. If the code is more fun than pulling at your shirt, she&#39;ll likely do that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the more you lump these things together in your mind the more potentially damaging to your relationship with her. They&#39;re really all very very common behaviours for a four year old. With regards to others not liking them either, be light and be less stressed about them and re-direct her with a quiet word or a distraction. After that try not to worry about what other people think. But be respectful: if she doesn&#39;t stop and it&#39;s getting uncomfortable, tell her you think that you should both leave, and do so if she still continues. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would drop the idea of trying to correct them. See it more as trying to work with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best,<br/>\nJo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 27 Aug 2012, at 02:02, &quot;ch1qui74&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ch1qui74@...\">ch1qui74@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi, my oldest just turned 4.
