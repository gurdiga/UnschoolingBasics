Not so great<br/>\nfor conversation but at the same time if the public won&#39;t tolerate<br/>\nmeanness to kids, it will get less acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve often thought it would be nice to carry a passel of brochures<br/>\nthat advocate non-spanking or other gentle methods and resources that<br/>\nyou could simply hand to someone and say &quot;I thought this might be<br/>\nsomething you&#39;d enjoy&quot;. Much less obtrusive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe place I find it hardest to advocate for children is at work, where<br/>\nI have to consider my employment and how customers will react if I say<br/>\nsomething that offends. I try to focus on the child in those instances<br/>\nand tell the parents how wonderful their child is. When they respond<br/>\nwith negatives I simply disagree gently &quot;oh, I bet he&#39;s just<br/>\ntired...that&#39;s so normal for that age&quot; or &quot;she&#39;s just letting us know<br/>\nwhat she needs&quot;  or something along those lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"Genant2@aol.com","from":"Genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Yikes Reality Check","postDate":"1189518045","msgId":26141,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQwMi4xOWViOTIwYS4zNDE3ZjRkZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26146,"prevInTime":26140,"nextInTime":26142,"topicId":26141,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/11/2007 9:25:39 A.M.

I speak  from where <br/>\nI am standing.  I share what we do in our family, how it works  for us, what <br/>\nit looks like with our relationships.  If someone is more  interested they will <br/>\nask me to expand, if not that is fine too.  But it  presents how we do things <br/>\nin a comfortable manner without offending  anyone.  <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;We steer away from philosophies that advocate spanking.&quot; Lets them know  <br/>\nwhere you are coming from and what you are working with in your family.   But you <br/>\nare not demanding that they do things the same way, and you are not  saying <br/>\nthat they are wrong (which usually turns people off immediately).   But it <br/>\ngives them something to think about and an opportunity to ask for more if  they <br/>\nwould like.  Who knows they may go home and think about it more.   You never <br/>\nknow who you touch by example.  I think this was a great thing to  say.  I always <br/>\ntry to come from a place of love and admiration and that  allows for <br/>\nconnection and sharing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts<br/>\nPam  G<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit my blog:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26143,"nextTopicId":26134}}
