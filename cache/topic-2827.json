She talked at length about her years as a teacher and librarian, and her views on limiting TV for kids.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe statement that bothered me most, tho, was &quot;Children have to be taught to read; it isn&#39;t something you learn automatically.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was also very telling was this, &quot;My mother said she knew I&#39;d be a teacher when she heard me scolding my dolls for not paying attention.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nOkay.. so kids must be scolded to pay attention, and must be taught to read, because they can&#39;t be trusted to learn it on their own. So how does that explain all the folks like me (and Gary) who learned to read at age 4 without being taught by anyone.  <br/>\n <br/>\n************<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;From Publishers Weekly<br/>\nRecent surveys show  that &quot;national experts&quot; are the third most trusted type <br/>\nof public figure (after  Supreme Court justices and schoolteachers). &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nScary, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
