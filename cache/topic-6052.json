I have a basket of condoms in the bathroom closet.  I told her about them, we talked about ethics, about responsibility, about that I love her no matter what.

I know if my hubby tried to tell me what to do, see or read I&#39;d surely rebel.  I guess its a little hard to let him totally grow up.  But as long as he still comes to me before he goes to bed and gives me a hug and says our goodnight ritual we&#39;ll  be okay.<br/>\nI want him to be independant but still alittle  dependant on me too.  <br/>\nTeen years were difficult in the past, I have 2 adult children and one of which we had an extremely difficult time with.  This is why I have chosen to try and change they path we follow with our family & the 6 kiddies we are lucky to still have at home.<br/>\nI love the advice you all have given me and enjoy reading all the replies to others postings.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol - who is now smiling bigger than before  :)<br/>\n  <br/>\n  ********************************************************<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   On Aug 15, 2005, at 11:04 AM, camden wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; But what about<br/>\n  &gt; content?

When they were littler I did wait until they were in<br/>\nbed before I would watch movies that had content that I found inappropriate<br/>\nfor them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey knew there were things called R rated movies and at some point they<br/>\nreally wanted to see one just because I had limited them. (by purposefully<br/>\nwaiting for them to be asleep before watching one.)  When I finally eased<br/>\nup, I found that they only were interested because we had limited them. They<br/>\nmade it a point to watch one or two and then they weren&#39;t interested anymore<br/>\nbecause the movies were just not interesting to them.  They don&#39;t want to<br/>\nwatch things just because they are R rated anymore.  They don&#39;t have<br/>\ninterest in movies that are created for adults, for the most part.  They<br/>\njust don&#39;t hold their interest.  Once in a while if we are watching<br/>\nsomething rated R my youngest (almost 9) will come sit with us just because<br/>\nshe wants to be with us.  Nothing she sees on TV seems to bother her and she<br/>\nknows better than to repeat what she hears among the uninitiated.  My older<br/>\ndd (10) finds something else to do if she thinks a movie we are watching<br/>\nwill bother her.  (scary or otherwise)  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo sum it up, as long as your kids know not to repeat what they hear, if<br/>\ngiven the chance, they learn filter what they aren&#39;t ready for.  I am always<br/>\nthere to talk with them about anything they see that is too much for them<br/>\nbecause they only reason they usually chose to watch something R rated is<br/>\nwhen we are watching too.  On their own they still choose cartoons and horse<br/>\ntraining shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227522899,"authorName":"camden","from":"camden &lt;ccoutlaw@...&gt;","profile":"ccoutlaw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"tv & music?","postDate":"1124118242","msgId":6052,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTgwMWM1YTFhYSQ5Yjk0MGFkMCQ3MjAxYThjMEBIT01FPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwNDAwMWM1YTE5MiQyZGZjOGMzMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBob21lPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6061,"prevInTime":6051,"nextInTime":6053,"topicId":6052,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi I ve been reading and re-reading alot of posts here and have a question.
