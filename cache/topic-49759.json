Here, those things are scheduled. After many years of attending and presenting at conferences, I&#39;ve heard many times that someone came just to hear me, or just to hear the unschooling speakers. At least half the time, too, the room I&#39;m assigned is busy until just before time, and we have to get out quickly, or parents have to leave to get their children. We will have adjoining rooms—one for quiet play, and one for the presentations and meetings.&quot; Sandra Dodd<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allunschoolingminnesota2013.blogspot.com/\">http://allunschoolingminnesota2013.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRegistration still open and hotel conference rates still holds.
