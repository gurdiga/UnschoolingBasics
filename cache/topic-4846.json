I&#39;m grateful and will re-read the  <br/>\nlast bunch of posts often. Just want to clarify: I have no interest in  <br/>\nfollowing the school department&#39;s requirements -- but I do have to gain  <br/>\napproval of an ed plan and submit a progress report at the end of the  <br/>\nyear. I&#39;m only interested in making sure I&#39;m free to homeschool. So  <br/>\neither I have to do stuff that they consider equivalent in nature (but  <br/>\nnot identical), or I have to be able to explain what we really do in a  <br/>\nway that satisfies their criteria. When the kids were younger, it was  <br/>\neasier to take an unschooling month and find so much stuff in it that  <br/>\nwas &quot;equivalent in nature&quot; to what the schools expected. As they get  <br/>\nolder, it gets a lot harder to pull that kind of terminology out of  <br/>\nwhat we really do. Though, again, I&#39;ve got no problem doing that in  <br/>\ncertain curricular categories, but quite a bit of a problem in the  <br/>\nother ones. Personally, if I didn&#39;t have to report, we&#39;d never think  <br/>\nagain about those categories!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to make sure you get where that pressure is coming from.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 3, 2005, at 10:49 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are 9 messages in this issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Topics in this digest:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       1.

I am a worrier, and I feel better! My<br/>\n&gt; husband is a librarian and where he worked (at the Boston Public<br/>\n&gt; Library -- he&#39;s a curator at a private institution now) you need an MLS<br/>\n&gt; to be considered a &quot;professional.&quot;  I believe most of the big research<br/>\n&gt; libraries are the same. But I was clueless about smaller libraries. I<br/>\n&gt; guess the trade-off would be salary, as always! But that&#39;s often a<br/>\n&gt; worthwhile trade if everything else falls into place, isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And yes, these guys know all about what&#39;s out there to explore -- we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; not far from Boston and the local support groups organize stuff all the<br/>\n&gt; time. We just don&#39;t tend to hook up with them much anymore. But we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; certainly not isolated, either. My oldest does volunteer at 2 libraries<br/>\n&gt; so she&#39;s getting experience. Joanne got the science thing, alright.<br/>\n&gt; Fear of spiders and bees has kept us out of nature for the last bunch<br/>\n&gt; of years, so the first part of the year was spent trying to work<br/>\n&gt; through curriculum stuff because the kids thought that would be a good<br/>\n&gt; way to &quot;get some science.&quot; But it goes against all of our grain and we<br/>\n&gt; just plain dropped it. We&#39;re starting to explore (like, this is our<br/>\n&gt; first week!) the many videos and NOVA programs that don&#39;t include<br/>\n&gt; arachnids or blood and guts (that takes a little research).  And I<br/>\n&gt; think they&#39;re actually liking it. I certainly am, so maybe that helps.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I guess it&#39;s okay to ignore all the stuff about your kids needing to<br/>\n&gt; be well-rounded and let them round themselves however they like<br/>\n&gt; (barring requirements from the school dept.)? They are basically<br/>\n&gt; happier, and will be happier and happier the less we feel obligated to<br/>\n&gt; do stuff...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks again for you thoughts --<br/>\n&gt; Julia<br/>\n&gt; p.s. we&#39;re working on that physical activity thing, too!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; _<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; _<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 2<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 2 Feb 2005 11:28:59 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: Julia Berkley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:juliaberkley@...\">juliaberkley@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Model United Nations<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In answer to Jill&#39;s question about Model United Nations: They happen<br/>\n&gt; all over the country, usually organized by the political science<br/>\n&gt; departments of various colleges.

I recently was part of an  <br/>\n&gt; on-line<br/>\n&gt; conversation on a non-unschooling homeschool list about unschooling.  <br/>\n&gt; It was<br/>\n&gt; brought up because of an article I was part of in the local paper about<br/>\n&gt; unschooling. The conversation was very respectful which isn&#39;t always  <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; case on non-unschooling lists...anyway, being &quot;well rounded&quot; was  <br/>\n&gt; brought up<br/>\n&gt; and discussed. It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve run into that concern in  <br/>\n&gt; regards to<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.  The concern expressed was basically &quot;if I don&#39;t force my  <br/>\n&gt; kids<br/>\n&gt; to learn certain things, they will not be &#39;well rounded&#39;&quot; We discussed  <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; definition of &#39;well rounded&#39; which of course, had different meanings to<br/>\n&gt; different people so defining our meanings cleared up a lot. It seems  <br/>\n&gt; to me<br/>\n&gt; that in this day and age it is impossible to know &#39;a little about<br/>\n&gt; everything&#39; (one of the definitions that was used) and being exposed to<br/>\n&gt; different things, places, people, etc is going to be limited to some  <br/>\n&gt; degree<br/>\n&gt; by one&#39;s income, location, interests, etc. regardless of how one is<br/>\n&gt; educated. I&#39;m not particularly worried about my kids being &#39;well  <br/>\n&gt; rounded&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; My kids have areas of interest they pursue...but because of friends,  <br/>\n&gt; my own<br/>\n&gt; interests, activities they&#39;re involved in, they become exposed to  <br/>\n&gt; things<br/>\n&gt; they wouldn&#39;t on their own.  They are more &#39;well rounded&#39; than some,  <br/>\n&gt; less<br/>\n&gt; than others....but what seems right for us at this time.  So though  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; worried about it, I find it an interesting topic of conversation and<br/>\n&gt; thought.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~April<br/>\n&gt; Mom to Kate-18, Lisa-15, Karl-13, & Ben-9.<br/>\n&gt; *REACH Homeschool Group, an inclusive group meeting throughout Oakland<br/>\n&gt; County.. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingonashoestring.com/REACH_home.html\">http://www.homeschoolingonashoestring.com/REACH_home.html</a><br/>\n&gt; *Michigan Youth Theater...Acting On Our Dreams...<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.michiganyouththeater.org/\">http://www.michiganyouththeater.org/</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;What one knows is, in youth, of little moment; they know enough who  <br/>\n&gt; know<br/>\n&gt; how to learn.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Henry Brooks Adams (1838-1918)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; _<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; _<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 6<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 02 Feb 2005 16:14:33 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: college and rich environment<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 2/2/2005 11:54:03 AM Eastern Standard Time, Julia  <br/>\n&gt; Berkley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:juliaberkley@...\">juliaberkley@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Joanne got the science thing, alright.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Fear of spiders and bees has kept us out of nature for the last bunch<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of years, so the first part of the year was spent trying to work<br/>\n&gt;&gt; through curriculum stuff because the kids thought that would be a good<br/>\n&gt;&gt; way to &quot;get some science.&quot; But it goes against all of our grain and we<br/>\n&gt;&gt; just plain dropped it.

I&#39;m sure you could find one that would satisfy the  <br/>\n&gt; school board of you *had* to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cooking is commonly used as &quot;science&quot; by homeschoolers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As an unschooler, though, I can see that making &quot;Stone Soup&quot; isn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; *just* &quot;science&quot;----it&#39;s chemistry, of course, but it&#39;s also full of  <br/>\n&gt; art, history, literature, sociology, math, biology,----possibly even  <br/>\n&gt; foreign language/customs, depending on the soup!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So I guess it&#39;s okay to ignore all the stuff about your kids  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; needing to be well-rounded and let them round themselves however  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they like (barring requirements from the school dept.)? They are  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; basically happier, and will be happier and happier the less we  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feel obligated to do stuff...&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you actually KNOW an adult who is well-rounded? My dad is about the  <br/>\n&gt; closest to well-rounded that I know---kind of a renaissance man----but  <br/>\n&gt; he is totally in the dark when I talk about John Holt (or unschooling)  <br/>\n&gt; or bees or a poodle&#39;s pompons! He&#39;s NOT well-rounded in *my* world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would be a fish out of water at a NASCAR event---and that&#39;s OK. It&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; not part of my world. I&#39;m not well-rounded when it comes to NASCAR.  <br/>\n&gt; But if I wanted to be (let&#39;s say I divorced and married Mario  <br/>\n&gt; Andretti&#39;s grandson---you can tell how out of the loop I AM! &lt;g&gt; OHOH!  <br/>\n&gt; Jeff Gordon---he&#39;s one, right? &lt;g&gt;), I could probably learn myself  <br/>\n&gt; right into that world in no time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Each person&#39;s world is different. Well-rounded has nothing to do with  <br/>\n&gt; anything because...well, life (and the world) changes. It used to be  <br/>\n&gt; important to know how to chop wood properly. Well, lots of folks have  <br/>\n&gt; no need of wood. Do I still need to know how? Am I not well-rounded if  <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know how? In Montana, maybe!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (barring requirements from the school dept.)? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Too much school talk! There&#39;s NOTHING they can require that you can&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; provide just by living. Honestly! My kids can cover more in one day  <br/>\n&gt; than a school can cover in a week. We just look at things in a  <br/>\n&gt; different way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Start looking at your world with unschooling eyes and you&#39;ll be able  <br/>\n&gt; top see the art and literature and chemistry and biology and physics  <br/>\n&gt; and history and life and love in a pot of soup!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; _<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; _<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 7<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 03 Feb 2005 13:31:09 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Latoya Hanson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stuff4mom@...\">stuff4mom@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: mornings<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My children are sleeping later and later in the mornings.

I  <br/>\n&gt; realize television can be educational, but what if that was all the  <br/>\n&gt; child ever wanted to do?  OK, I can see an obvious answer - get rid of  <br/>\n&gt; the television! LOL, but seriously, even if there is no TV in your  <br/>\n&gt; home, how would you handle a child who is lazy about anything to do  <br/>\n&gt; with education, such as writing or reading something now and then,  <br/>\n&gt; etc.?<br/>\n&gt; Debbie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The concern expressed was basically &quot;if I don&#39;t force my kids<br/>\n&gt; to learn certain things, they will not be &#39;well rounded&#39;&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; _<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; _<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 9<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 03 Feb 2005 09:24:32 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;J.
