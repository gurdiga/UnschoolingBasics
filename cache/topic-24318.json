I would like a little advice on an issue.  I<br/>\n&gt; live next door to <br/>\n&gt; my in-laws (which includes two adult children still<br/>\n&gt; living at <br/>\n&gt; home).  They mean well, but they all are constantly<br/>\n&gt; at my house to <br/>\n&gt; see my two children.  I don&#39;t want to see them that<br/>\n&gt; often, and now <br/>\n&gt; that my daughter is three, it is getting harder to<br/>\n&gt; avoid them.  If <br/>\n&gt; there is a knock at the door, we always have to<br/>\n&gt; answer it now.  How <br/>\n&gt; do I avoid this?  Please consider this, they all<br/>\n&gt; have different <br/>\n&gt; schedules, and they can start coming from eight in<br/>\n&gt; the morning until <br/>\n&gt; eight or later at night.  We plan on moving<br/>\n&gt; eventually, but that <br/>\n&gt; depends on a job my husband is waiting for a<br/>\n&gt; position to open.  My <br/>\n&gt; kids love seeing them all the time, but I don&#39;t want<br/>\n&gt; to!  If the <br/>\n&gt; overwhelming opinion is to just &quot;suck it up&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; forget my yearning <br/>\n&gt; for a smidgen of privacy, then I would have to ask<br/>\n&gt; you for advice on <br/>\n&gt; handling very pushy in-laws.  Because, not only are<br/>\n&gt; they ever <br/>\n&gt; present, but they also do not respect my decisions<br/>\n&gt; and they <br/>\n&gt; manipulate my children to do what they want them to<br/>\n&gt; do.  For <br/>\n&gt; example, we have been outside for several hours and<br/>\n&gt; it is getting <br/>\n&gt; dark and I say we need to go inside now.  The<br/>\n&gt; grandfather might <br/>\n&gt; say, &quot;oh let her stay out longer&quot;.  I then say, &quot;no,<br/>\n&gt; we really need <br/>\n&gt; to do &quot;x&quot;.  He keeps on and at this point my child<br/>\n&gt; is running in the <br/>\n&gt; opposite direction.  My F-I-L is well known for<br/>\n&gt; doing very dangerous <br/>\n&gt; things.  He has held my baby next to popping grease<br/>\n&gt; and would not <br/>\n&gt; give her back to me (I was hormonal and I swear I<br/>\n&gt; could&#39;ve killed <br/>\n&gt; him!) He had her riding on a plow once even after I<br/>\n&gt; said &quot;no&quot;.  He <br/>\n&gt; is even a bad role model at times--he was riding on<br/>\n&gt; a tractor <br/>\n&gt; spraying the fruit trees and had a PLASTIC BAG OVER<br/>\n&gt; HIS HEAD!!  <br/>\n&gt; These are just a few -- I could go on and on!  They<br/>\n&gt; also will ask my <br/>\n&gt; child to &quot;ask me&quot; things they know that I won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; allow.  I feel like <br/>\n&gt; they should take these issues up with me and not use<br/>\n&gt; my child to <br/>\n&gt; make me look like the bad guy.

I would like a little advice on an issue.  I live next door to<br/>\nmy in-laws (which includes two adult children still living at<br/>\nhome).  They mean well, but they all are constantly at my house to<br/>\nsee my two children.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about inviting them for supper and telling them you have something <br/>\nvery important to discuss with them all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTell them that you love them very much but that you&#39;re feeling that <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t treating you as the *parent* of your own children. You feel <br/>\nthat you need to have the *right* to be your children&#39;s parent (so to <br/>\nplease back off)---and that, since you are *homeschooling*, you need at <br/>\na minimum 8:00-3:00 for &quot;school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTell them (almost) what you told us and exactly what you need and <br/>\nexpect.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet them know that you will revisit the topic weekly (maybe even plan a <br/>\nSunday dinner each week for all of you ---or Tuesday steak night or <br/>\nWednesday homemade pizza night) to let them know how it&#39;s working for <br/>\nyou. You can take that time each week to show them what the children <br/>\nhave done &quot;school-wise.&quot; That way they will know they get one night <br/>\neach week that *you* devote to them, specifically. They get to see and <br/>\nplay with the kids and find out what they&#39;re interested in. Maybe the <br/>\nkids would like to put on a short play r puppet show or something for <br/>\nthe grands or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following week do it all over again; but if they don&#39;t follow your <br/>\nguidelines, you could get a little more emphatic. If they aren&#39;t <br/>\nplaying along, you can eventually tell them that you WILL refuse to let <br/>\nthem see their grandchildren if they won&#39;t play nice. But then you HAVE <br/>\nto do it---at least for quite a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, we have been outside for several hours and it is getting<br/>\ndark and I say we need to go inside now.  The grandfather might<br/>\nsay, &quot;oh let her stay out longer&quot;.  I then say, &quot;no, we really need<br/>\nto do &quot;x&quot;.  He keeps on and at this point my child is running in the<br/>\nopposite direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it *is* time to go in now, simply scoop up your child, start <br/>\nwalking towards the house, and say, &quot;See you tomorrow!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow you word things IS important---don&#39;t give him an &quot;in&quot; to play his <br/>\ngames.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also will ask my child to &quot;ask me&quot; things they know that I won&#39;t <br/>\nallow.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nLike what?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.

No wonder you are concerned about you father-in-law. This goes far beyond being pushy or disagreeing, his behavior is irrational and dangerous!<br/>\n  What does your husband say to his behavior, especially when he is driving with a bag over his head? Is he trying to stop and reason with his Father? <br/>\n  If not, you have to make clear to him, that this is affecting the safety of your children, not just a convenience or a nuisance. In this case I would set clear boundaries with your husband first. For a few days, until you have had a chance to agree in detail with your husband how to deal with this dangerous behavior, stay clear of them. <br/>\n  Then enforce them strictly. <br/>\n  The second part of the issue you have raised, there is a blatant disrespect toward your authority as a mother - just because you are unschooling does not mean you are not in charge of your life and your household. This part will take more time to really help you with each issue. But for now, focus on the first part of the problem, keeping your kids safe.<br/>\n  I also offer you my services - email me, privately, if you wish, so we can work on whatever part of this issue you want to, together. As a homeschool coach, I will not charge anyone on this list for my services, so feel free to contact me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjblanton123@...\">cjblanton123@...</a>.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hope this helps.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Rev.
