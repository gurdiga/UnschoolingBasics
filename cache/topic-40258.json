The tricky part is finding ways for the other partner to feel like a valuble, loved member of the family - its easy to slip into &quot;mom and kids -vs- dad&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPlenty of families come to unschooling with only one parent onboard at first. Its a strange new thing - geez my dp has found some new &quot;cause&quot; or crazy idea... like home birth or breastfeeding on demand or going diaperless. It takes time to adjust to the strange new thing - and a parent working outside the home doesn&#39;t have as much time. It takes longer. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was helpful for George, early on, for me to just listen to his concerns about the kids, and his unhappiness that I seemed more interested in their feelings than his. I worked on being more appreciative of him, personally, of showing him in ways that made sense to him that I valued him and his feelings. That&#39;s what, eventually, got him &quot;on board&quot; with unschooling. He&#39;s never read a darned thing about it, as far as I know. And he&#39;s a staunch radical unschooler, too, so I know its not *necessary* to have all your ducks in a row, as far as parenting goes, before you start.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284534827,"authorName":"Jeff Sabo","from":"Jeff Sabo &lt;freeboysdad@...&gt;","profile":"freeboysdad","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] night time...help","postDate":"1243040948","msgId":40264,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyODM2Mi4zNzAwMi5xbUB3ZWI1NTgwNy5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40262,"nextInTopic":40274,"prevInTime":40263,"nextInTime":40265,"topicId":40258,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Hubby clucks his tongue and smiles at my struggles, because he never really was into homeschooling much less un-schooling.

Unschooling as an educational philosophy only is really hard to do if both parents are not on board; but when it becomes more a lifestyle choice (allowing them to choose their own bedtimes, as an example)it is critical that you guys be in at least the same book, if not on the same page. Mocking your struggle is an indicator, as is defining it as &quot;your struggle.&quot; If he has never been into homeschooling or unschooling, why are you doing it? It&#39;s one thing to be the leader of the unschooling in your home with a resistant partner, but it&#39;s something else entirely to have him not go along at all. I may be crossing into a discussion that you did not intend to raise, but  . . . .  having only one of the parents actually be a parent is not sustainable long-term, is it? I&#39;d encourage you to try and reconcile this before you start<br/>\n unschooling, because unschooling is amazingly challenging under the best of circumstances when both parents are aligned. <br/>\n <br/>\nWishing you a peaceful path - <br/>\n <br/>\nJeff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: night time...help","postDate":"1243034498","msgId":40262,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd2N2MyMitsaTRsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGd2NmVrMytkN21oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40258,"nextInTopic":40264,"prevInTime":40261,"nextInTime":40263,"topicId":40258,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ********************** It might be better to start waking them earlier, rather than trying to get them to wind down earlier.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-151698379\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;sistergoddesselli&quot; &lt;elinorsparks@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; the kids want to try to go to bed earlier, to accommodate my needs and to get more outside play during the daylight hours for themselves.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be better to start waking them earlier, rather than trying to get them to wind down earlier. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237471585,"authorName":"sistergoddesselli","from":"&quot;sistergoddesselli&quot; &lt;elinorsparks@...&gt;","profile":"sistergoddesselli","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"night time...help","postDate":"1243004355","msgId":40258,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd2NmVrMytkN21oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":40262,"prevInTime":40257,"nextInTime":40259,"topicId":40258,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We started homeschooling in December 2008 and un-schooling in February/March.
