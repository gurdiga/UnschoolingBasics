Sometimes this will work with my big guy but more times than not it is like he is afraid when he rages and wants me close,even to the point of lying with him and holding him tightly. After that ten minutes he almost forgets that there was <br/>\nanything wrong.Yes,I have noticed this sometimes too,like maybe he blacks out sometimes and doesn&#39;t remember the raging.  The trick though is that a  In the past, we have tried to <br/>\nconsole him, or get angry at him when he is calling us names in the <br/>\nmiddle of his rages.I am getting better at controling myself and not getting angry at him when this happens,to just be there for him and this helps him and me much more.  We have now learned to just walk away and let <br/>\nhim rage.I have tried this but he will follow me screaming and cursing,or worse throw something at me,so I have to stay with him.But I do get my younger dh away.  Sometimes that goes against what radical unschoolers <br/>\nsuggest but that is the only thing that allows him to come off his <br/>\nrage.You have to do what is best for YOUR child and only you know what works and what doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that we have come to realize is that there has to be <br/>\nfood available for him to grab at all times.  If his blood sugar <br/>\ngets even slightly low or he is hungry at all, there is probably a <br/>\nrage right around the corner. Ditto on this!If his blood sugar drops it&#39;s ON!! Sleep is also HUGE for him, and it is <br/>\njust not a matter of getting enough but when he gets it.  If he is <br/>\nnot asleep by midnight, regardless of when he wakes up, the next day <br/>\nis likely to be a difficult one. We have to give him benadryll at night or he would stay up for 24 hrs straight or longer and would rage for days.He has never gone to sleep without something to help him since he was 2.Before that he never slept more than 2 hrs at a time. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is also very sensitive to lots of noise!  Last night we were at a <br/>\nHUGE family gathering and I learned something new about him.  He had <br/>\nhis PSP and was playing it in a corner by himself almost the entire <br/>\nevening and the evening went as smooth as ever.  So I guess if he is <br/>\nfocused on something when there is all of this noise and commotion <br/>\naround him, he doesn&#39;t really notice it.  So now the PSP is coming <br/>\neverywhere with us!!!!!This is just the opposit of my guy,he would have been bouncing off the walls!Nothing would have calmed him.But if there had of been another child(couldn&#39;t have been 2 or more)he would have been fine!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that we have noticed that helps a lot is LOTS of hugs <br/>\nand positive comments and compliments, during the day, about the <br/>\nthings that we love about him. Right on! Best therapy there is for mine too,nothing helps more. It is so easy to get focused on the <br/>\nrages because they spend so much of our energy but he needs to know <br/>\nhow wonderful he is!!  And the great thing about him is that just as <br/>\nintense as his rages are, so is the intensity of his love and <br/>\ncompassion for people!!!This brought tears to my eyes,I came from a very abusive home growing up and have often said that Elijah was placed in my life to teach me real love and how to express it.He is the most loving human being I know,but then I know that you know exactly where I am coming from&lt;smile&gt;<br/>\n  Thanks you have helped me more than you know.<br/>\n  Tricia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n        Secondary school education   Graduate school education   Home school education     Graduate school education online   High school education   Chicago school education <br/>\n    <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!
