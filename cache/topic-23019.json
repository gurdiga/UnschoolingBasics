Being<br/>\nthe only unschooled family (all the other kids are homeschooled with<br/>\nregular work, etc.), my dd felt behind the others in this area.  Now<br/>\nshe keeps bringing it up and says that she wants to know why X and Y<br/>\nare part of math, when it is about numbers not letters.  She also<br/>\nfeels that she isn&#39;t as smart as the other kids who could answer the<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nUp to now, our math has just been answering her questions and through<br/>\nmonetary purchases, sewing patterns, and cooking.  We have never used<br/>\na math book, etc.  However, I don&#39;t know how to teach variables<br/>\nwithout using a math book.  We have much of the Math-U-See series,<br/>\nwhich I won in a raffle, but we&#39;ve only used the manipulatives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also have tremendous math anxiety, as shown to me by Pam G. at last<br/>\nyear&#39;s conference.  Opening the Math-U-See book and seeing triangles<br/>\nand lengthy problems practically brought me to my knees - lol (never<br/>\nmind that I made it through College Calculus II.  I look at my old<br/>\nbooks and am completely clueless - lol).<br/>\n<br/>\nDD wants to be a vet and if she continues on that path, math is in our<br/>\nfuture.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I know how to teach, what to teach, etc.?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarla    Mom to Amy (8 yo.) and Lily (3.5 yo.)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23008,"nextTopicId":22953}}
