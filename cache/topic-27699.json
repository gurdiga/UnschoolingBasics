On Dec 8,2004 I married a true NY&#39;er Italian/Colombian(born in Queens-raised in Long Island).  I am an adoptive mother of 4 GREAT boys. Only 2 are at home living & learning with us. My oldest is 16 has graduated from homeschool, and continues to live in FL.  My 14 yr old stays with my brother in KY who is also unschooling.  Then there are my 12 & 10 yr old who arrived fully engaged at ages 7 mos and 24 hrs old, I&#39;ve had the longest time of learning together with them.  They are my most avid &quot;teachers&quot;.  I&#39;ve been a huge John Holt fan since 1996 then Josh was born in 1997, so he&#39;s been my inspiration to &quot;unschool&quot;. I couldn&#39;t homesschool until the boys were legally adopted.  I wouldn&#39;t neccessarily call myself a radical unschooler, but I am learning all the time how our unschooling path has led to our personal relationships to be enriched.  This is a lifestyle we choose to live. That is why I am drawn to &quot;unschooling<br/>\n basics&quot;, to learn more  We as a family have moved ALOT and this lifestyle has been rewarding way more than challenging.  The boys were born in Oklahoma, where they came into my life, it took 3 yrs of fostering to finalize the adoption & at the turn of the century, our journey of life (legally) began together.  We left OK 12/99, to PA (my adoptive family lives)until 2/00 and then went South to Florida, we lived in Deltona (3 mos), Gainesville (13 mos)-where I learned to scuba dive! Jacksonville (9 mos), Starke (4 mos), Hollywood & Pembroke Pines (the rest of the time, maybe 3 yrs&#39;ish). We returned to OK (where both sets of my grandparents had lived & my mother currently lives) from 8/05-02/07 (18 mos) and then we moved to CA (where my dad has lived for 39 yrs-raising my stepmoms 5 children and having 1 more child between them) It was nice &quot;getting to know them&quot;  then on 10/15/07 we left southern CA for Lexington, KY almost a mo. we have been here and it is a beautiful city,<br/>\n but much to big for what we like (I have come here for some medical needs I had to have attended to that kept being put-off in the LA-VA 4 cancellations! I was like &quot;These are my ta-ta&#39;s you are brushing off! LOL)  The VA here has been absolutely wonderful in handling my needs, we still have a few more tests & biopsies to experience, but that is our purpose for being here. We have met some great homeschoolers here and have done some really neat activities with them, like Children&#39;s Play Place at the Lexington Athletic Club our 1st day here!! Then we had a bowling trip with them since there were over 30 of us we got 99 cent (incl shoe rental and 2 hrs of games!) been to the Ky aviation museum & airport-my husband had as much fun as the boys, since he&#39;s become familiar with the planes through movies.  We&#39;ve begun a newspaper route at 3 am! It&#39;s been fun working altogether. I&#39;d love to create a business that affords us to all be at home working together via the interent,<br/>\n mailing or something. So my husband doesn&#39;t have to leave us between 6am and 1 pm. He&#39;s a shuttle bus driver here at UK, he was a &quot;little&quot; trk driver in NY- I love saying that hehe, I taught him to drive big rigs 4 yrs ago. My background has been military- I was a cryptologist (Please don&#39;t hold that against me :) ) then I was medically discharged in 1987, I began driving a tractor-trailer across all 48 states. As a CDL instructor/driver trainer. I took a couple yrs break while I fostered 17 children in my home. Then went back since it&#39;s all I knew and wasn&#39;t willing to put time & $ into a college for a piece of paper to tell others I knew something else. I just sold my tractor-trailer in April (7 mos ago), yes the boys were with us.  And they loved it!! If it weren&#39;t so harsh on my back I&#39;d probably still be doing that, but we have moved into another phase of our life. Currently, the boys are enjoying their new bikes, and skateboards, ramps, BBQ, neighborhood friends,<br/>\n &quot;Roots & Shoots&quot;, camping, football, basketball, pets, scouting etc all more than the PS2 & movies for the time being!  Oh & their all-time best....sleeping in a still-not bouncing bed LOL. I kinda miss the vibrations to go to sleep with, too. :)  I am looking forward to meeting other un-schoolers and enjoying this journey together wherever you may be. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Loving Un-Schooling.........<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jana, Genaro, Jake & Josh <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
