Yet I also suspect that at times this is the best a parent of an adult can do. Once our kids are adults of course they may (will) make decisions we don&#39;t understand. Maybe they&#39;ll even send their kids to public school! I said that some of their decisions may couse me grief, which I feel is not synonymous with disappointment. Disappointment implies judgement. Grief is normal sadness, and if feelings are real and natural in our kids, aren&#39;t they so in us as well?<br/>\n With regards to whether military personnel desire peace and deserve honor for risking their lives, I know they do. I also know that many young people, the very ones actually out there, don&#39;t realize what they are in for until they are asked to shoot civilians (this happens in every war, whether it&#39;s admitted or not), or are sitting in a tank with their friend&#39;s severed leg across their laps and his fat on their face. (This happened to my friend&#39;s son, and my friend is a Viet Nam vet.)These kids are irrevocably harmed even if they return without a sctatch on them.  I beieve that they are lied to by our culture and sacrificed willingly. I also believe that most military personnel, though I honor them, are unaware of being caught up in a big human lie. That&#39;s my opinion, and I have a right to it, as you have a right to yours. My friends whose husbands have gone to our current war have never heard a word out of me like this because it would hurt them and be of no support or<br/>\n comfort. I&#39;ll say no more on this subject.  <br/>\n I think when replying to a post, if any of us are tempted to change the person&#39;s wording (such as changing grief to disappointment) it may mean that the reply does not directly answer the question.     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, March 12, 2007 8:56:24 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Learning without books<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: acsp2205@yahoo. com<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would happen if one of my kids joined the army, or killed <br/>\nsomeone, I would<br/>\ngrieve, and they would know it because we have that kind of honesty <br/>\nbetween us.<br/>\nBut I would never withdraw my love and support, and I think they know <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nEven with love and support, a parent&#39;s disappointment is hard to live <br/>\nwith.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd keep in mind that joining the service does NOT mean the child will <br/>\never have to kill.
