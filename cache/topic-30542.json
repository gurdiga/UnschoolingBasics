So I feel resentful and angry<br/>\nat the conflict over going.  On the other hand, I am often sick and<br/>\nstruggling with depression, so it can be hard to get out and about.<br/>\nOur schedule changes a lot and we are usually up late at night so the<br/>\nkids do not have the wish to go out very often. I want them to ask to<br/>\ngo places but that&#39;d mean consistent follow-ups on my part as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are 8 and 4 (twins)  - so I am not too confident on their<br/>\nability to opt out on something and stay home by themselves.  I could<br/>\ntry with the oldest but not with the youngsters, I think they are too<br/>\nyoung yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are some ways we could work together better on this?  What do you<br/>\nall do for your kids, especially single moms?<br/>\n<br/>\nAdrean</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30351,"nextTopicId":30532}}
