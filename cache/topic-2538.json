I should preface by saying that my daughter led me by the nose<br/>\ninto unschooling.  She has always been allergic to following anybody elses&#39;s<br/>\nschedule or doing scheduled activities or being given even the mildest<br/>\nsuggestions about something she is trying to do unless she asks for them.<br/>\nShe really has shown me how important it is to her to get that joy from<br/>\nfiguring things out herself, no matter what form that takes, and I&#39;ve gotten<br/>\ngreat joy from learning to respect that and watch her go.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven the above, it never made sense to me to even bother to suggest<br/>\nswimming lessons for her.  I&#39;m not against them by any stretch, but when I<br/>\nreflect on my daughter&#39;s reactions to being suggested to try something, to<br/>\ndoing anything like lessons on a schedule, and to being &quot;shown how to do<br/>\nsomething&quot;...well, it didn&#39;t take too long to do the math on that one.  So<br/>\nAline&#39;s swimming history has gone like this.  When she was around the age of<br/>\n4 she watched a Caillou episode on trying new things where Calliou&#39;s Daddy<br/>\n&quot;teaches him how to swim&quot;.  She was in the midst of a real &quot;trying new<br/>\nthings phase&quot; herself, and immediately begged me to &quot;teach me how to swim,<br/>\nMom&quot; which I interpreted as wanting to do what Caillou was doing.  We headed<br/>\nto the nearest pool.  She asked me to &quot;show her how&quot;.  I explained what the<br/>\nswimming aids were for and she strapped one on.  I pointed out what other<br/>\npeople were doing.  She went in the water in my arms and we just had fun,<br/>\nblowing bubbles, swirling around, dipping in.  Within two weeks, without any<br/>\nreal instruction on my part, she was swimming no her own with the aid on.<br/>\nThe following summer (this would be last summer) when she was 4 and a half<br/>\nshe figured out how to snorkel.  This summer at 5 and a half her big thing<br/>\nhas been swimming all by herself without the aid.  My sister keeps trying to<br/>\n&quot;teach&quot; her strokes (we are usually at their pool).  I just get in the pool<br/>\nwith her, ask her where she wants me to stand, and let her try her best to<br/>\nswim to me without any floating aid.  If she asks questions I answer them.<br/>\nOtherwise I don&#39;t say anything other than offer encouragement and smile a<br/>\nlot.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day recently, she saw another little girl swim under water at my<br/>\nsister&#39;s pool.  &quot;Mom, I want to try that!&quot; she shouted.  I got in the pool<br/>\nand in minutes she was doing it.  Her body naturally became horizontal<br/>\nunderwater, the thing she&#39;d been struggling with in swimming too far without<br/>\nthe swimming vest on.  She came up and cried &quot;Mom, I LOVE being<br/>\nunderwater!!&quot;  She continued staying pretty close to the stairs to the pool,<br/>\nfigured out how to turn underwater, started to do sommersaults under there.<br/>\nI said, &quot;You know, I&#39;ve noticed when you swim underwater, your body gets<br/>\nflat like you&#39;ve been trying to do above water.  I bet you could swim across<br/>\nthe pool now (the short way).&quot;  She decided to try it with me beside her,<br/>\nand by gum, she did it.  Five times in a row.  Needed no help.  But she<br/>\nwasn&#39;t so interested in pursuing that further, because what was more<br/>\ninteresting to her was diving down.  She figured out how to turn herself<br/>\nupside down and go down to the bottom (my sister has a porch pool that is<br/>\nonly 3 feet deep for the whole pool).  We got diving toys for her to<br/>\nretrieve.  Next visit my sister said &quot;I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s a five year<br/>\nold diving in my pool.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBest thing was at my sister&#39;s birthday pool party for her daughter who<br/>\nturned five last week.  We were there with a bunch of 4 through 6 year olds.<br/>\nMothers all talking about swimming lessons.  This lady watched my daughter<br/>\nand turned to me to say &quot;Gosh, how early did you have her in lessons?&quot;<br/>\nimplying that from how she was doing, must have been practically prenatal.<br/>\nI said &quot;She&#39;s never had any lessons.  She got interested from watching<br/>\nCaillou swim and figured it all out herself.  Isn&#39;t it amazing what kids can<br/>\ndo?&quot;  I wish I had a polaroid of the look on her face.  I think I completely<br/>\nburst her &quot;kids are empty vessels that need to be filled up with knowledge<br/>\nand lessons&quot; bubble.  It was so great.  (Of course what would be greater<br/>\nwould be for people not to have that mentality but since she did, it sure<br/>\nwas fun bursting her bubble).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody else got any &quot;burst the bubble&quot; stories?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2531,"nextTopicId":2477}}
