I have never stressed the &quot;ma&#39;am and  sir&quot; thing.<br/>\nNever. Even before I was unschooling. I also don&#39;t insist that  my<br/>\nchildren call adults by Mr. or Mrs. _______. Just their names.<br/>\nThat&#39;s  how I introduce them to my adults friends. &quot;Martha this is my<br/>\ndaughter  Emily. Emily this is my friend Martha.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********<br/>\n <br/>\nI missed the original post on this.<br/>\n <br/>\nI treat my kids the way I believe they will be &quot;expected&quot; to treat someone  <br/>\nelse.  I live in the land of &quot;ma&#39;am&quot; and &quot;sir&quot;.  I speak that way to  other <br/>\npeople naturally and I speak that way to my children.  That  sounds weird &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen my daughter says &quot;mom????&quot;, I say pleasantly &quot;yes, ma&#39;am?&quot;  But I  would <br/>\nnever insist on her saying it back.  If she is going someplace where  that <br/>\nsort of thing is expected, I might talk to her about  being mindful of it.<br/>\n <br/>\nI introduce or talk about adults the way the adult would like to be  called.  <br/>\nSo our neighbors are &quot;Miss Marcie&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Smith&quot; and  &quot;Linda&quot;.....all <br/>\nabout the same age.<br/>\n <br/>\nLike all things in social interractions, there is a huge spectrum of  <br/>\npossibilities.  Manners are a custom to help people speak a  common language of <br/>\nrespect and kindness.   Like all other languages,  children will pick up what is <br/>\nuseful for them and we will emphasize some things  that will help them navigate. <br/>\n I think they become more intuned with time  and experience.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf a person feels disrespected just because someone left out a &quot;ma&#39;am&quot;,  <br/>\nwell, that is their problem.  I used to get in trouble when we moved to New  <br/>\nJersey when I was a child because I said &quot;yes ma&#39;am!&quot;, they thought I was being  <br/>\nelitist.<br/>\n <br/>\nBy the way, my husband used to be on the Presidential helicopters.  I  never <br/>\ngot to meet either the Clintons or the Bushes, but many of my friends  did.  <br/>\nOne friend even had Thanksgiving dinner at Camp David with the  Clintons.  <br/>\nAnyhoo, the staff makes sure that you know your presidential  etiquette before you <br/>\ntalk with them.  I&#39;ll have to ask my husband  when he wakes up if he ever saw <br/>\nsomeone act &quot;inappropriately&quot; (gasp!)  and see what happened.  <br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17956,"nextTopicId":17970}}
