For instance &#39;Oh Brother Where Art Thou&#39; is a hilarious<br/>\nspoof with so much wonderful folk music that ds enjoys.  He gets that<br/>\nthere&#39;s a lot of humor, but since there&#39;s a lot of violence he<br/>\nsometimes gets quite concerned too.  I fast forward through the scene<br/>\nwith the bible salesman when he&#39;s frog squishing, tree limb bashing<br/>\nand the whipping scene.  They make *me* cringe.  But I tell ds that&#39;s<br/>\na pretend cow that got run over.  Those aren&#39;t real bullets... that&#39;s<br/>\njust for the movie.  &quot;Oh no... not the livestock.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI started doing more of this when we watched the Cat in the Hat movie<br/>\nstarring Mike Myers (a movie I personally didn&#39;t like).  That is,<br/>\nafter I read one of the unschooling lists advising to tell kids movies<br/>\naren&#39;t real, especially at disturbing points.  WellYeh... duh on me. <br/>\nToo straightforward for me to think of.  I tend to make these things<br/>\nharder than they have to be.  It&#39;s not like I have a great mentor I<br/>\ncan go to --other than the RU lists-- for parenting advice, so thanks<br/>\nfor spelling this stuff out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd during that same general time I found myself telling ds the things<br/>\nhe had up til then absolutely loved, enjoyed and gotten so much fun<br/>\nout of --monsters-- aren&#39;t real.  He became frightened of them<br/>\novernight it seems like, and suddenly they had taken on different<br/>\ndimensions to him.  He was saying there were monsters in the potty. <br/>\n??  I&#39;m not sure how that fear came about and I&#39;ll probably never<br/>\nknow.  I told him the only monsters we had in the house were on the<br/>\ntv, and even those weren&#39;t real.  He hasn&#39;t brought it up since, and<br/>\ngone back to playing monster with gusto.  No worries.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust think... here I was a couple years ago, concerned about the bad<br/>\ninfluence of tv.  Huh... tv has been a FANTASTIC easy way to build<br/>\ntrust with ds.  It even helps with real life --not just what&#39;s on the<br/>\nscreen.  Wow.  Too cool... too cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nA very simple thing.  I was glad for the support of unschooling lists<br/>\nwhich always have an odd habit of bringing up subjects right when I<br/>\nneed them.  I rarely if ever post a question.  Somebody always beats<br/>\nme to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh wait... how have you guys dealt with fear of the dark?  That&#39;s<br/>\nsomething I haven&#39;t been able to beat for ds.
