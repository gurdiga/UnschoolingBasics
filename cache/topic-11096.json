It&#39;s when that <br/>\nis seen as something &#39;more than&#39; learning through other means, <br/>\nwhen &quot;doing your math workbook&quot; is given more positive feedback than <br/>\ncompleting a complicated videogame level. Workbooks are one resource <br/>\namong many in an unschooling world. Also, &quot;educationally planned <br/>\nactivity&quot; divides the world into educational and non-educational - <br/>\nremove the divider.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;   I feel like I fall into<br/>\n&gt; this category, which makes me feel like unschooling would be the <br/>\n&gt;natural<br/>\n&gt; approach for us.  But, as a former teacher of 7 years I find it <br/>\n&gt;nearly<br/>\n&gt; impossible to lose the &quot;what is my child going to learn from this&quot; <br/>\n&gt;question.<br/>\n&gt; As a multi handicapped teacher there was no curriculum, I made it <br/>\n&gt;up as I<br/>\n&gt; went along planning fieldtrips to any community places I could <br/>\n&gt;find out<br/>\n&gt; about and planning classroom activities to go along with that.  As <br/>\n&gt;a teacher<br/>\n&gt; I would look at a trip to the zoo for example and think what can I <br/>\n&gt;teach my<br/>\n&gt; children about animals. differences in the animals and in their <br/>\n&gt;habitats.<br/>\n&gt; Are these not the same things an unschooler would explainer to <br/>\n&gt;their child<br/>\n&gt; during a family trip to the zoo?   Does transforming that question <br/>\n&gt;into<br/>\n&gt; &quot;will my child enjoy this experience, and what can I learn about <br/>\n&gt;what my<br/>\n&gt; child enjoys by doing this activity&quot; allow me to become an <br/>\n&gt;unschooler?  Do I<br/>\n&gt; have to give up the thought &quot;what will my child be exposed to or <br/>\n&gt;even what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; going on in our community that she would enjoy being exposed to&quot; to<br/>\n&gt; unschool?  What exactly is the difference between doing child led <br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt; interested based home schooling and unschooling.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>What seems of interest to my child and how can I facilitate that <br/>\ninterest? What interesting tidbits can I bring from the world into <br/>\nour home? If you start from the assumption that everything provides <br/>\nlearning, then the question &quot;what will my child learn from this?&quot; <br/>\nshifts a little bit. Because what your child learns from a trip to <br/>\nthe zoo and what my child learns from the same trip on the same day <br/>\ncould be totally different - and that&#39;s the glory of it all. It&#39;s <br/>\nnot a one size fits all answer. And your child will likely learn <br/>\nsomething different each time you go to the zoo, even if you go and <br/>\njust watch the monkeys for hours and hours every time and that&#39;s it <br/>\n(no lions, tigers, bears, lemurs, nothing but one cage of monkeys). <br/>\nAs an unschooler, I&#39;d help my DS find out the answers to his <br/>\nquestions about animal behaviors and habitats or I might comment on <br/>\nsomething new I found out or something I thought was really cool but <br/>\nI would not stand him in front of the monkeys and do a 5 <br/>\nminute &#39;lesson&#39; on primates, habitats, food, etc. We&#39;d stand there <br/>\nand marvel at the amazing and silly and sometimes human-like <br/>\nbehaviors of the monkeys and maybe read the plaque things for more <br/>\ninfo ... and maybe not. Everything is learning, not everything <br/>\nrequires a lesson. Definitely work on looking out for things to <br/>\nintroduce that might be interesting - but have no vested interest in <br/>\nwhether it&#39;s a yes or no response. For example, 3 years ago, DS <br/>\nwanted to do a town soccer camp. We signed him up, he went, great <br/>\nfun (mostly - there were two slightly older boys in his group that <br/>\nwere annoying to pretty much everyone). The following year, he had <br/>\naged up into the next level group - longer sessions, more drill <br/>\nwork. He did some of it and sat out some of it - he found a partner <br/>\nthere who also didn&#39;t want to do so much drill and just wanted to <br/>\nrun and kick the ball so they did that off to the side for some of <br/>\nthe time, only joining in the organized portion when they wanted to. <br/>\nLast year, I offered it again and he said no thanks. I&#39;ll offer <br/>\nagain this year too probably - and he&#39;ll likely say no but he might <br/>\nsay yes. This year he&#39;s more interested in the fact that once he <br/>\nturns 8 (early June) he&#39;ll be able to actually go on the par 3 golf <br/>\ncourse near us and play *real* golf (instead of mini golf or the <br/>\ndriving range).<br/>\n<br/>\nChild-led, interest based homeschooling says &quot;Ok, Jimmy is <br/>\ninterested in dinosaurs. So, I (mom/dad) will go put together a unit <br/>\non dinosaurs - we&#39;ll study where they lived for geography, we&#39;ll <br/>\nmeasure ourselves, the house, etc and compare to the size of various <br/>\ndinos (math), we&#39;ll read books about dinos (reading) and write <br/>\nstories about them, maybe write up an invented dinosaur (language <br/>\narts), and we&#39;ll do a little on archaeology and biology for <br/>\nscience.&quot; Jimmy doesn&#39;t have much say over what and when, just the <br/>\nareas of interest - and if he&#39;s tired of dinos in a week but mom has <br/>\nit planned for 3 weeks, that&#39;s the way it is. Now, it may be that <br/>\nyou end up doing all those things more of less simply because Jimmy <br/>\nis interested in dinos (we always compared dinosaurs to Daddy - DH <br/>\nis 6 ft tall so a small dino might be 1/2 a daddy size, a medium one <br/>\nmight be daddy size or twice daddy size, and a big one would be 6 <br/>\ndaddy sizes or more). <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was happy to see the post that a fellow unschooler had their <br/>\n&gt;child<br/>\n&gt; enrolled in a Gymboree program.  My daughter loves attending an <br/>\n&gt;art class<br/>\n&gt; there.  I wasn&#39;t sure if the fact that I enroll her in local <br/>\n&gt;community<br/>\n&gt; classes in arts and sports meant that I wasn&#39;t an unschooler.  I <br/>\n&gt;enroll her<br/>\n&gt; in classes to find out what her interests are.  For example I <br/>\n&gt;enrolled her<br/>\n&gt; in a Kindermusik class that she doesn&#39;t seem to enjoy, and even <br/>\n&gt;though it<br/>\n&gt; meant a lot of money down the drain we stopped going since she <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t enjoy<br/>\n&gt; it.  As an unschooler do you still encourage your kids to do <br/>\n&gt;things they<br/>\n&gt; appear to have an aptitude for, dropping it of course if there is <br/>\n&gt;no<br/>\n&gt; interest?  Most of the things I&#39;ve seen about unschooling make me <br/>\n&gt;feel like<br/>\n&gt; I won&#39;t be successful at it since I don&#39;t garden, only cook if it <br/>\n&gt;can be<br/>\n&gt; prepared in 30 min. or less, and more or less don&#39;t do a lot in <br/>\n&gt;the way of<br/>\n&gt; house work.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;ll offer things we see but I don&#39;t sign DS up for something <br/>\nwithout his okay on it - even if I think he&#39;d really enjoy it. In <br/>\nthe corporate world, it&#39;s called &#39;buy in&#39;. If he &#39;buys in&#39; to a <br/>\nclass, activity, whatever, then we&#39;ll go ahead and arrange it - with <br/>\nthe understanding that he can stop if it isn&#39;t suiting him (too <br/>\nlong, too teachery, too whatever for him at the time). Gardening and <br/>\ncooking are nowhere near the whole world of unschooling - bring your <br/>\ninterests into the house...and be willing to stretch a bit when your <br/>\nchildren&#39;s interests DO happen to be cooking or gardening. I know <br/>\nway more about James Bond now than I ever thought I would because DS <br/>\nloves the videogames and movies (fortunately, so does DH).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Basically here&#39;s what I do with my dd maybe one of you can tell me <br/>\n&gt;if it<br/>\n&gt; falls under the unschooling category, and if it doesn&#39;t why.  It <br/>\n&gt;seems<br/>\n&gt; lately most of our day is spent playing pretend with her stuffed <br/>\n&gt;animals the<br/>\n&gt; theme is usually mom and baby or friends/sisters.  She can&#39;t seem <br/>\n&gt;to get<br/>\n&gt; enough of it.  Last week she was really into Polar Bears, so we <br/>\n&gt;rented a<br/>\n&gt; National Geographic movie about them, printed coloring sheets of <br/>\n&gt;them to do<br/>\n&gt; art projects and of course played mommy and baby polar bears with <br/>\n&gt;her<br/>\n&gt; stuffed animals.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>All fun things. No problem with the activities per se. All things <br/>\nare learning and all things are resources. If she enjoys it, great. <br/>\nWhere the rub comes in is when she wants to stop the video halfway <br/>\nand return it or decides to not finish the coloring page (or maybe <br/>\nnot start it even). That&#39;s where the rubber meets the road so to <br/>\nspeak - is it okay with you? do you let her stop but inwardly clench <br/>\nyour teeth because she hasn&#39;t finished? do you go one step further <br/>\nthan she&#39;s interested because &quot;it&#39;s an educational video&quot;? Those are <br/>\nthe questions to ask inside yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhole life unschooling is a lifestyle of giving the same respect to <br/>\nkids that we give to adults - you&#39;d never think of making your <br/>\nspouse/SO read the plaque at the monkey enclosure and then tell you <br/>\nabout them (if you could readily read it yourself). So why do that <br/>\nwith your kids? My DH doesn&#39;t pester me about practicing piano - I <br/>\ngot what I wanted out of it for the time and I&#39;ll probably get back <br/>\nto it eventually but for now that&#39;s not something I&#39;m interested in. <br/>\nSo why would I want to pester DS about doing something he&#39;s no <br/>\nlonger interested in? A shorthand is to think before you do <br/>\nsomething whether you would do/say things in the same manner with <br/>\nyour partner (regardless of the topic). <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of analogies maybe to chew on:<br/>\n<br/>\nremember back when you were dating whomever? you studied that <br/>\nperson, their looks, their interests, everything about them. If you <br/>\nknew that this beloved person was head over heels excited about <br/>\nTransSiberian Orchestra&#39;s music, you might pick up a newly released <br/>\nCD, you might keep your eyes and ears out for concert performances <br/>\nnearby, and so on. And, if you gave the CD and they didn&#39;t play it <br/>\nimmediately, you&#39;d (hopefully) be okay with that. Apply that to your <br/>\nkids - study them, look for things that might pique their interest, <br/>\nlet them decide whether to run with it or let it sit.<br/>\n<br/>\npicture a big all you can eat buffet, everything from anchovies to <br/>\nzucchini is available. You assist your child as needed - holding the <br/>\nplate, helping with those really long serving utensils, providing <br/>\ninformation &quot;this winter squash with brown sugar is very similar to <br/>\nsweet potatoes&quot;, pointing out favorites &quot;I noticed that there was <br/>\nmac& cheese over this way - want to get some?&quot; and so on. But the <br/>\nchoices are theirs as to what to put on that plate. Once that plate <br/>\nis done, you might notice that the squash wasn&#39;t a big hit so some <br/>\nis still there but the mac & cheese disappeared in a flash. They <br/>\nmight want to go right back and get a whole plate of just mac & <br/>\ncheese. Or they might want to get some cherry tomatoes and bell <br/>\npeppers (the rings of bell peppers are really handy for corralling <br/>\nthose rolly tomatoes BTW lol). Or they might choose to sit and let <br/>\nthe first plate digest a bit. Your job is not to push them to refill <br/>\nwhen they want to rest a bit. It&#39;s not to make them rest when they <br/>\nwant to refill. Your job is to facilitate what they choose to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last one - learning is like eating (can you tell it&#39;s near time <br/>\nfor my mid morning tidbit lol) - what a given person needs at a <br/>\ngiven time is totally individual. Yes, we all need certain nutrients <br/>\nbut the proportions, timing, sources are all variable. And while <br/>\neating is a visible action, the real work is digesting. Trying to <br/>\npush in more food when what is needed is digesting is a recipe for <br/>\ndiscomfort if not disaster. Same with learning: the &#39;quiet&#39; times <br/>\nwhen new learning is being assimilated might not look like much <br/>\n(might in fact look like a banquet of old cartoons) but that is when <br/>\nthe learning is building up the internal network/structure/&quot;body&quot; of <br/>\nthought. The school paradigm requires eating a set amount at a set <br/>\nrate with little time for digesting/incorporating the information. <br/>\nAllowing for down time is just as important, if not moreso, than <br/>\nproviding stimulation and &#39;learning opportunities&#39;. The idea that <br/>\nlearning happens all the time does not mean that constant feeding is <br/>\nrequired. As with food, balance is key. I know I&#39;ve seen it with my <br/>\nDS - he&#39;ll be deep into something, then he&#39;ll get quieter, maybe <br/>\nmove to something else, when he cycles back to the first thing he&#39;s <br/>\nincorporated the first portion and is ready at a deeper (or higher) <br/>\nlevel for more. It definitely doesn&#39;t look anything like what <br/>\nsomeone with a school paradigm in mind would expect.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157089938,"authorName":"S Drag-teine","from":"&quot;S Drag-teine&quot; &lt;dragteine@...&gt;","profile":"dragteine76","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Total newbie question","postDate":"1143640386","msgId":11131,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDIwMWM2NTMzOCQxYmUzOGY1MCQyZTUwZjdhNUBob21lY3B1MjAwNjAxMD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ0MjlDM0MzLjIwNDAyMDdAY294Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":11119,"nextInTopic":11133,"prevInTime":11130,"nextInTime":11132,"topicId":11096,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son is the same way, getting frustrated when he loses anyway.

Learning to<br/>\nknit socks was my unschooling turning point for myself.  I knew how to<br/>\nknit.  I learned as a child.  Had been knitting all my life, but had been<br/>\ntold that knitting socks was hard and I would have to take a class.  I<br/>\nfigured it out on my own because it was something I truly wanted to do.

At the time I had<br/>\nno idea what they meant, but not long after I answered (education) I<br/>\nrealized I was actually more of a life unschooler.  Is that the same as<br/>\nradical unschooling?   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRE: Unschooling is just that &quot;not school&quot; - so the &#39;education&#39; part is open,<br/>\nnot school-<br/>\nlike, not subjects, not curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBy curriculum do you mean any kind of workbook activity, or do you just mean<br/>\nany kind of educationally planned activity.  Some children love the Fun Pad<br/>\ntype of workbooks you find at grocery stores.  Does letting your child use<br/>\nthese mean you&#39;re not an unschooler?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI joined this group b/c I&#39;m a newbie and still trying to figure out the<br/>\ndifference in all the different ways to home school, and where my family<br/>\nfits.  Going by Deb&#39;s definition of Radical unschooling:  trusting that kids<br/>\nwill learn what <br/>\nthey need when and how they need it) and extending it to the rest of life -<br/>\nthings like bedtimes, media access, food/meals, etc. I feel like I fall into<br/>\nthis category, which makes me feel like unschooling would be the natural<br/>\napproach for us.  But, as a former teacher of 7 years I find it nearly<br/>\nimpossible to lose the &quot;what is my child going to learn from this&quot; question.<br/>\nAs a multi handicapped teacher there was no curriculum, I made it up as I<br/>\nwent along planning fieldtrips to any community places I could find out<br/>\nabout and planning classroom activities to go along with that.  As a teacher<br/>\nI would look at a trip to the zoo for example and think what can I teach my<br/>\nchildren about animals. differences in the animals and in their habitats.<br/>\nAre these not the same things an unschooler would explainer to their child<br/>\nduring a family trip to the zoo?   Does transforming that question into<br/>\n&quot;will my child enjoy this experience, and what can I learn about what my<br/>\nchild enjoys by doing this activity&quot; allow me to become an unschooler?  Do I<br/>\nhave to give up the thought &quot;what will my child be exposed to or even what&#39;s<br/>\ngoing on in our community that she would enjoy being exposed to&quot; to<br/>\nunschool?  What exactly is the difference between doing child led or<br/>\ninterested based home schooling and unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI was happy to see the post that a fellow unschooler had their child<br/>\nenrolled in a Gymboree program.  My daughter loves attending an art class<br/>\nthere.  I wasn&#39;t sure if the fact that I enroll her in local community<br/>\nclasses in arts and sports meant that I wasn&#39;t an unschooler.  I enroll her<br/>\nin classes to find out what her interests are.  For example I enrolled her<br/>\nin a Kindermusik class that she doesn&#39;t seem to enjoy, and even though it<br/>\nmeant a lot of money down the drain we stopped going since she doesn&#39;t enjoy<br/>\nit.  As an unschooler do you still encourage your kids to do things they<br/>\nappear to have an aptitude for, dropping it of course if there is no<br/>\ninterest?  Most of the things I&#39;ve seen about unschooling make me feel like<br/>\nI won&#39;t be successful at it since I don&#39;t garden, only cook if it can be<br/>\nprepared in 30 min. or less, and more or less don&#39;t do a lot in the way of<br/>\nhouse work.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically here&#39;s what I do with my dd maybe one of you can tell me if it<br/>\nfalls under the unschooling category, and if it doesn&#39;t why.  It seems<br/>\nlately most of our day is spent playing pretend with her stuffed animals the<br/>\ntheme is usually mom and baby or friends/sisters.  She can&#39;t seem to get<br/>\nenough of it.  Last week she was really into Polar Bears, so we rented a<br/>\nNational Geographic movie about them, printed coloring sheets of them to do<br/>\nart projects and of course played mommy and baby polar bears with her<br/>\nstuffed animals.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease help me end the confusion!<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Deb<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 28, 2006 4:30 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Total newbie question<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n*\t Visit your group &quot;unschoolingbasics<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics</a>&gt; &quot; on the web.<br/>\n  <br/>\n*\t To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>?subject=Unsubscribe&gt; <br/>\n  <br/>\n*\t Your use of Yahoo!
