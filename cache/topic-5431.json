Right now we live in NC where the compulsory age is 7 so I haven&#39;t had to do anything with the state yet.  But we&#39;ll be moving to SC in Dec/Jan with my dh who&#39;s stationed there, and the compulsory age there is 5.  Is there anyone who lives in SC who has any advice for me as far as the laws go?  I looked over the laws and it looks like option #3 would be the best one (because you don&#39;t have to deal with the public schools) but I was hoping somebody could give me some real life experience with SC law and unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKim : )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBig Yellow Box by CRAYOLA!<br/>\nKimberly Griffin<br/>\nIndependent Sales Consultant<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bigyellowbox.net/kc\">http://www.bigyellowbox.net/kc</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:createwithcolor@...\">createwithcolor@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAlso visit my Biz Buddy:<br/>\nKathleen Weaver, The Carolina Weaver<br/>\nwww.carolinaweaver.com<br/>\nCustom handwoven baskets and totebaskets</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5424,"nextTopicId":5435}}
