So as big-screen gameplayers, your children are not equals. And you wouldn&#39;t have that as a goal, to force a false equality on them in that sense. What you DO want is to treat each child&#39;s passion equally or equivalently -- to help them find it and engage it, whatever that means. Ideally each child will support the others&#39; passions whether they are similar or wildly different. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchooling is about subdividing and standardizing and competition for scarce resources. Unschooling is the opposite of that in every imaginable way. It&#39;s about multiplying and diverging and synergy and systems theory. It really does depend on changing your mindset first, not the tv schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; .... If the other kids had an interest in something the older child is/has been passionate about and at the time we were able to provide the resource for the older at the time but can not provide the same resource for the youngers, for now...would it not be just as important to come up with some way to figure out a way to use what we had to find a middle ground so that the youngers needs are met as well?  We are just not able to bring in another &quot;anything&quot; at this time regardless if it a tv, video system, pack of cards, instrument...etc.  So, how do I find the middle ground with what we have now. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Try thinking of it this way - if he was passionate about playing the violin and your other kids were kind of so-so, sometimes liking to play but not all the time, you wouldn&#39;t expect him to share his nice violin. If he was passionate about fencing, you wouldn&#39;t expect him to share his foils and safety gear. If he was passionate about bicycling... do you see where I&#39;m going with this? The problem is that its something you deem of lesser value - maybe without realizing it - and that&#39;s clouding your understanding. Geez, kid, its just a violin, why can&#39;t your siblings play with it too?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ---Meredith<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar","from":"&quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Ideas/advice??

Sometimes, that requires me to throw out conventional wisdom and conventional ideas. If I feel like I don&#39;t have the physical space for something, I start thinking about what I can move or rearrange. I ask the kids. I ask my spouse. I go online and look for ideas. I was watching a show the other day and a professional organizer was showing how she could live in 100 or 200 square feet. I don&#39;t remember the specifics but she was able to have a lot of stuff in that small space. I am wondering if you could go online and do some research about how to optimize the space that you do have. You say that you don&#39;t have enough room for any more screens even if they were free. Would it be possible to stack them and have children use headphones? We have come up against several different limits but together we have found workable solutions. The solutions may not be what we had originally hoped for but they are workable. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, find small things to do that make YOU feel better. I know that it is hard for me to be creative and giving when I feel like I am lacking. Perhaps you will be able to think of more creative solutions if you can find small ways to build yourself up. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Ideas/advice??

You can draw the line you have chosen to draw and live with the consequences. Or you can look more closely at why you feel the need to draw this particular line.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout listing our life story, but in a nutshell: We may have started out with the construction quite a few years ago, but since then we have had a major accident w/brain damage, job loss, and the list goes on... so, we are on survival mode. Meaning that if it does not feed us, shelter us, clothe us... we do not buy it.  So yes, this particular line has been drawn out of necessity.  We have sold what we can (have worked on keeping tv, game systems, and computer because the kids requested..), turned in jars of coins to pay mortgage and buy groceries.  We do not have internet, cable, or memberships to anything.  The game systems and one of the tvs were gifts and the other one was bought prior to the beginning of construction (but with parts of the home torn apart...there is no space for additional screens, even if free). We are not in a position to resolve the issue by &quot;just getting...&quot;. Nor can we give up any vacations(those are just wistful dreams), or cut back any more on groceries, choose not too put gas in the car (we can, but then a job comes under jeopardy), or just not get medications.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just feels like from some of these responses and reading other threads that so many issues become resolved by just going out and buying and/or getting something. I can respect that, if you are able to, but it seems like one can really feel that they are lacking in meeting their child&#39;s needs as a parent, if their situation does not allow such an easy solution. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may sound like I am being obstinate, but I have not only been taking it all in, but sharing it with the boys, who have been really following the exchange and become more proactive in their ideas of figuring out our situation! So this exchange alone has been a huge help and bonus....so thank you to all honesty and responses!!<br/>\n<br/>\n...Erin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Ideas/advice??

We are really, really trying to meet needs, but an addtional tv, for now, is not an option due to finances  and space issues (long term construction ).

We had a very similar situation going on here last year, and this group gave us some excellent advice.

I agree with Meredith that 2 hours does not seem like long to a kid playing a video game. Mine have been known to spend 15 hours straight on Pixie Hollow! The solution is simply to make more game systems or computers available.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   We can not afford to buy any more tvs, game systems or same games for each system.

Your kids are making it pretty clear that what they want/need at this time is more access to games and media.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it becomes a family priority, you *will* find ways to afford more game systems and/or TVs.  We talked as a family about our limited resources and how we could allocate them to get more computers. We suggested giving up an unschooler gathering, skipping our annual trip to see grandparents in Florida, having the kids work in our family business so we all made more money, reducing the grocery budget, one adult taking a freelance job, selling off outgrown toys on craigslist, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our case, each of the kids decided to shell out their life savings to buy themselves laptops or desktop computers. DD10 was still short on money, but she worked off the debt by taking pet-sitting jobs and selling a cage she no longer needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, did the problems disappear once the competition for games was eliminated? Believe it or not, they did gradually fade away. It took a few months for the communication patterns to change and for the younger kids to forgive the hurts from their older sister. But now, 8 months later, the kids are so much more friendly and helpful to each other than ever before. It&#39;s like they are a different family. Naturally, there have been other family shifts during that time, but the gist of all of them is to provide for the kids&#39; and adults&#39; needs and desires. Regardless of how difficult that seems at first.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Ideas/advice??

If he&#39;s having to give up what he&#39;s doing just when he&#39;s finally gotten settled in, no wonder he&#39;s getting cranky on a regular basis. His &quot;turn&quot; needs to be long - six hours, all day, whatever lets him feel &quot;full&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s getting grumpy after longer periods of time (four hours or more) I&#39;d look at the need for snacks and movement. You can bring him snacks. You can also help him find ways to get up and move while things are loading or during natural breaks in a show or movie. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you trade in that big tv for two smaller tvs? Maybe one that lets you play multiple games? Used tvs aren&#39;t that costly, especially if they aren&#39;t hooked in to something like a satellite dish. Limited resources can make for a lot of conflict. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247088336,"authorName":"erinanddavey","from":"&quot;erinanddavey&quot; &lt;e_mckinney@...&gt;","profile":"erinanddavey","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Ideas/advice??

We have been homeschooling 6 years...dropping bits here and there and working towards fully unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short Ds, 14, pulled out of school beginning of third grade and Ds,done after 2nd (his choice to go and be done). Husband finally on board with no limits for media...t/v, comp, etc...  We are both on the same page and we just say yes when they ask and make no issue when they do not and just go on. <br/>\n<br/>\n Now, here is the issue.  Ds, 14, becomes very aggressive and rude after long uses and is so unwilling to relinquish use if someone else has been waiting.  Example, ds, 10, wanted to watch a movie on the tv and waited patiently for 2 hours for his brother to finish up...going into hour #3 not so patient (14 year old had already been using for 2 hrs before 10 year old started waiting).  Ds, 14, was verbally abusive to him and even shoved him a couple of times because he needed to just finish &quot;this level&quot;, which turned into quite a few levels.  This is just one example of many that happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what we have tried and our media set up: We have 2 tvs with two game systems which can not be swapped out due to jimmy rigging and the tvs are two different sizes, and one computer.  The 360, 14s favorite, which is also the big tv and sometimes 10 year old wants to watch movie on big tv.  He is usually content to watch on smaller tv, but was really looking forward to the big tv with example given.  We can not afford to buy any more tvs, game systems or same games for each system.  We have tried coming up with compromises, helping facilitate conversations between the two, letting them work it out...but in a nutshell, the household is really becoming quite a frustrating, negative feeling place to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to hear all input, but would really LOVE to hear from people that started the process hen the kids were older kids and w/siblings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n...Erin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46581,"nextTopicId":46622}}
