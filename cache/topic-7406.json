HAHA  In 5th grade I was held back in reading<br/>\nclass so I didn&#39;t enjoy reading, I loathed history as<br/>\nwell, there wasn&#39;t much after the 8th grade that I<br/>\nactually enjoyed.  I don&#39;t remember ever having math,<br/>\nhistory, grammar and such discussions with my peers. <br/>\nI mean, the last thing any of us wanted to talk about<br/>\nwas &quot;schoolish&quot; things and at those illegal get<br/>\ntogethers on weekend&#39;s we did not talk about<br/>\nscientific theories!  I graduated a &quot;C&quot; student.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring my school years I worked at the local grocery<br/>\nstore as a bagger,  stock clerk and finally  cashier. <br/>\nI was always great at basic math no more than was<br/>\nneeded in order to play board games!  I guess<br/>\n&quot;science&quot; was sort of used in the stock area and of<br/>\ncourse you do not want to bag chemicals with food<br/>\nproducts.  I joined the military as a seaman and went<br/>\nto a secretary school.  I was a Yeoman.

No (unless the<br/>\nparent does nothing). Even schooled children who love<br/>\nthat stuff go above and beyond what the school<br/>\nrequires but it is because they LOVE IT.  An &quot;A&quot;<br/>\nscience student will not go to college as a science<br/>\nmajor if they don&#39;t have a passion for science. <br/>\nChances are that once &quot;A&quot; science student doesn&#39;t know<br/>\nor remember anymore science than me.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless one is to be a historian or political advisor,<br/>\nis it really necessary for a child to be made to feel<br/>\nstupid, if they can&#39;t memorize all of those dates,<br/>\npresidents, wars, parts of our judicial system etc.? <br/>\nNo.  I&#39;m not saying that a child INTERESTED in that<br/>\nsort of thing should be prevented from learning those<br/>\nthings because a parent deems it unimportant.  The<br/>\nthing is, is it important to the learner?  <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren when provided a rich environment will hear<br/>\nabout, see, read, etc. about some of those things<br/>\nregardless of learning not being forced, but should a<br/>\nparent be concerned if they don&#39;t remember or enjoy<br/>\nthose things....no.  Really, it is pointless for a<br/>\nhomeschooler to force learning on their kids too,<br/>\nisn&#39;t it?  If they are given the opportunities to<br/>\nexplore what they like and enjoy, they&#39;ll do what it<br/>\ntakes to learn it.  People who actually &quot;love&quot; what<br/>\nthey do for a living are not common, many are<br/>\nmiserable and sad.  It&#39;s not always about money<br/>\neither, if one is making a living doing what they love<br/>\nto do, they can (as a person living paycheck to<br/>\npaycheck) be happier than a millionaire who hates what<br/>\nthey do, never sees their family, etc. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf all dd wants to do is learn about animals then I<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be concerned.  Has anyone ever seen those<br/>\nindividual dog and/or cat books?  They are huge, lots<br/>\nof science, history, etc. in those books alone and to<br/>\nparaphrase Heidi &quot;She will learn what she wants, not<br/>\nwhat the schools tell us or deams necessary that she<br/>\nshould be learning.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry that this is so long, but I just feel so good<br/>\ntoday!<br/>\n<br/>\nPs....we had a tiny breakthrough on bedtimes but I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sharing unless I&#39;m sure that dh understands it ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Learning,<br/>\n~Sandy<br/>\nwww.360.yahoo.com/aplan4life<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!
