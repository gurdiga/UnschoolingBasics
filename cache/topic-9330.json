The link was posted and those who wanted<br/>\nparticipated.  <br/>\nThe question was whether it was responsible for the basics list to<br/>\nrecommend a very schoolish activity - keeping in mind this list has a<br/>\nhigher membership of people in the process of deschooling than some other<br/>\nlists.     <br/>\n<br/>\n***because for you it has an association with <br/>\nschool.***<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me?  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the only one who noticed. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\n***Ya know, school is part of the world, like it or not. If there was no <br/>\nschool, would activities like these, reframed in different language, be <br/>\nmore fun or appropriate?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think everyone understands the reality of school.  But unschoolers have<br/>\nmade a deliberate choice to turn away from school and they&#39;ve done so<br/>\nbecause they believe life without school and school influence is a better<br/>\nlife.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***If there was no <br/>\nschool, would activities like these, reframed in different language, be <br/>\nmore fun or appropriate?***<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are fun things to do everyday, everywhere that are not associated<br/>\nwith schools or school language and that&#39;s what unschoolers know.  They<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to look to the schools or to things that look like school. <br/>\nThey don&#39;t have to use a school example.   They can look in another<br/>\ndirection entirely and find more than the schools could ever think to<br/>\noffer. <br/>\n<br/>\n***Is it just the <br/>\nlanguage you have a problem with?***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe language is a symptom.   And like a symptom, if a person can get rid<br/>\nof it for awhile, they can finally feel strong enough to fight the<br/>\ndisease.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe word &quot;student&quot; can keep parents looking at their child as if he was a<br/>\nperson who needed to be educated by some method or teacher.   For<br/>\nunschooling to work parents need to see their children as whole beings,<br/>\nnot lacking.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe words Kindergarten through (grade) twelve can keep parents comparing<br/>\ntheir children to other children and measuring them against a standard.  <br/>\nUnschoolers need to understand learning and growth are personal,<br/>\nindividual, unique. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I&#39;m very interested in language <br/>\nmyself- after all, the way we speak affects the way we think, and vice <br/>\nversa.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThen it makes sense for unschoolers to stop using school related language<br/>\nin regards to their lives and children.   Unschooling won&#39;t work if<br/>\nparents still see school and academics as a measuring stick.   It starts<br/>\nwith the language, it transforms in their heads to thinking, and for<br/>\npeople to think like unschoolers (to think like people who are *not<br/>\nschoolers* ) they need to stop using the language of school. <br/>\n<br/>\n***But, in a broader sense, couldn&#39;t ANY life be a life of<br/>\nunschooling?***<br/>\n<br/>\nNo.  Children who are compelled into school by law and by parents are not<br/>\nliving an unschooling life.  <br/>\nPeople who are schooling are not unschooling.    <br/>\n   <br/>\n***thereby segregating those that &#39;are&#39; unschoolers from those that<br/>\n&#39;aren&#39;t&#39; <br/>\nunschoolers. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers aren&#39;t trying to isolate their children from the world.  It<br/>\nis the schools have separated children from the broader society and<br/>\nisolated them in institutions.   Unschooled children are talking to and<br/>\nmeeting with people of all ages and backgrounds and beliefs every day.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I can imagine an unschooling mom who lets her <br/>\nbabies cry it out and spanks her children.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is a list to help new unschoolers discover and apply the<br/>\nunschooling philosophy to their whole lives and that&#39;s why discussions<br/>\nabout *how* to spank or *how* to let babies cry it out are not<br/>\nappropriate here.   Discussions to give moms ideas for changing those<br/>\npractices are welcome.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***(like it or not, I think we all have rules or <br/>\nguidelines, spoken or unspoken).***<br/>\n<br/>\nA well considered philosophy inspires principled living and leaves little<br/>\nor no need for rules.   Danielle Conger wrote a very thought provoking<br/>\narticle titled Rules vs. Principles for Life Learning Magazine and I&#39;ve<br/>\nincluded it at the end of this post for those who haven&#39;t read it<br/>\nrecently. <br/>\n<br/>\n***It&#39;s not that <br/>\nI value an educational website more than watching TV (though I&#39;ll admit <br/>\nI value almost everything more than TV;***<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you mean you didn&#39;t consiously compare the two things?  By your<br/>\nwriting it seemed you considered her interest in the activity an<br/>\nimprovement over watching TV.   If something is better, that&#39;s a value<br/>\njudgement.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***She is very rarely excited about <br/>\nanything, and she will sit in front of the TV for hours and hours, just <br/>\nzoning out because she has no interest in doing anything. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kinds of things does she watch? <br/>\n<br/>\n***it&#39;s that she was actually excited and energetic and <br/>\nhappy, which is rare for her.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it possible she was excited because you initiated something with her? <br/>\nBecause it doesn&#39;t fit that a child who &quot;has no interest in doing<br/>\nanything&quot; was interested in coin flipping/ data gathering in an instant. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are things that hinder unschooling.  Those things are often our own<br/>\nbeliefs.  Those beliefs that can hinder us are often revealed by our<br/>\nchoice of words because just as you said, the way we speak (or write) can<br/>\nbe an indication of the way we think.   So, when someone writes and uses<br/>\nlanguage that devalues their child&#39;s choices it&#39;s a clue to their<br/>\nthinking.   When parents are making judgements about a child&#39;s choice to<br/>\nwatch TV they&#39;re seeing the TV as less valuable than some other thing and<br/>\nthey&#39;re evaluating their child as less discriminating than they&#39;d like<br/>\nhim to be.   <br/>\n<br/>\nA child who&#39;s watching TV is watching *something.*  A comedy?  A drama? <br/>\nSports?  Cartoons?  Maybe she&#39;s interested in acting, dialogue, set<br/>\ndesign, fashion, comedic timing, language, good stories, animation,<br/>\ngraphics, human interaction, human potential, sound, lighting...  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor unschooling to really take off parents need to pay attention to what<br/>\ntheir kids like.  The need to know what they like to watch on TV and why<br/>\nthey like it.  They need to know what interests their child and be<br/>\ninvolved in that interest.  <br/>\n<br/>\n*If* a child really and truly &quot;had no interest&quot; in anything and was<br/>\nsleeping late and was staring at TV with a total lack of interest in the<br/>\nprograming then the parent should know why that&#39;s happening as well.   If<br/>\na child is lost and bored and doesn&#39;t have anyone helping her find<br/>\nwonderful things to do then the mom needs to be much more available.  <br/>\n     <br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom here it&#39;s Danielle: <br/>\n<br/>\nRules vs. Principles   <br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n-------<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, while attending the 3rd Annual Live and Learn Conference, I was<br/>\nfortunate enough to attend an ongoing seminar by Ben Lovejoy on Rules<br/>\nversus Principles. I had heard about a previous year�s presentation by<br/>\nBen and Sandra Dodd, which got me thinking about this difference. Posted<br/>\non an online discussion group, the rules/principles debate seemed a<br/>\ndeceptively simple semantic argument, but it sunk deep in my brain and<br/>\nrefused to let go.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrior to this initial discussion, I hadn�t thought much about the<br/>\ndifference between rules and principles, nor would I have thought it to<br/>\nbe a terribly important distinction if pressed. Not that is, until I<br/>\nreally began to hash it out in my own mind and found it to be absolutely<br/>\nfundamental to self-directed learning.  <br/>\nIf organic learning means believing in a child&#39;s innate ability and<br/>\nmotivation to learn, offering her the freedom in which to learn and<br/>\nrespecting the learning in every moment and method, then organic learning<br/>\nitself is dependent upon a freedom that must extend beyond the mere<br/>\neducational box of schooling. Freedom cannot be<br/>\ncompartmentalized--allowed here, unaccepted there--if it is to flourish.<br/>\nInstead, it must be nourished, fed, encouraged and allowed to expand, so<br/>\nit may fully form the individuals that our children are and choose to<br/>\nbecome.<br/>\n<br/>\nFreedom, however, does not mean a free-for-all. It does not mean freedom<br/>\nto destroy, hurt, abuse, manipulate or coerce others--a common<br/>\nmisconception when first encountering the ideas of self-directed learning<br/>\nor non-coercive parenting. Freedom has both natural and ethical limits.<br/>\nThe key is to find those limits rather than imposing arbitrary or<br/>\ncoercive ones in their stead. But, how exactly do we find those natural<br/>\nor ethical limits? That&#39;s where an exploration of rules vs. principles<br/>\nbecomes particularly useful. <br/>\n<br/>\nRules are all about authority, hierarchy, rigidity and absolutes. They<br/>\ntend to be top down, reinforcing a power structure that relies upon a<br/>\n&quot;might makes right&quot; mentality--&quot;because I say so,&quot; &quot;I&#39;m the parent,<br/>\nthat&#39;s why,&quot; &quot;That&#39;s just the way it goes.&quot; Rules exist outside the<br/>\nperson to whom they are applied. They are externally enforced and<br/>\nprohibit the possibility of question, adaptation or exception. <br/>\n<br/>\nRules, laws, regulations, commandments all inherently imply punishment<br/>\nfor transgression and silence for challenge. Break a rule, get grounded<br/>\nor spanked. Break a law, get a ticket or go to jail, and so on. More<br/>\nimportantly, rules are inherently paradoxical because they are<br/>\nsimultaneously absolute and arbitrary. <br/>\n<br/>\nA parent both chooses the rules and chooses who must follow and when. A<br/>\ndictator makes rules that he is above. Even in a democracy, rules require<br/>\ninterpretation, include loopholes and remain inconsistently and<br/>\nopportunely enforced. American jails, for instance, are filled with the<br/>\nracial inconsistencies in the application of American law. Rules and laws<br/>\noperate on the myth of universality while reality consistently reveals<br/>\nthe arbitrary nature of their application.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about a household rule like �No eating in the bedroom� for<br/>\ninstance. A decree like this is phrased as an absolute when it is far<br/>\nmore likely an arbitrary restriction that will get thrown out the moment<br/>\na parent wants ice cream during E.R. or the family wants to share a bowl<br/>\nof popcorn while snuggling in bed and watching a movie. As a rule, �No<br/>\neating in the bedroom� comes across as an arbitrary absolute�a paradox! <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren sense this internal contradiction and resist its inherent<br/>\ninjustice. Of course, countless parenting books hail &quot;consistency&quot; as the<br/>\nkey to enforcing rules successfully. In this example, then, a parent<br/>\nwould forfeit the family fun of popcorn and a movie and the pleasure of<br/>\nice cream in her own bed for the sake of consistency. Or worse, she would<br/>\nbecome sneaky, like so many parents, and enjoy the coveted treat only<br/>\nafter the children have been sent to bed, none the wiser. Either way,<br/>\nsomething is sacrificed: the joy of family bonding or the parent&#39;s own<br/>\nethical standing.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrinciples, on the other hand, are about autonomy, mindful living,<br/>\nfreedom and flexibility. Principles, rather than being absolute and<br/>\nautomatic, demand careful thought and inquiry both to establish and<br/>\napply. They represent a consensus about rightness, fairness and equity<br/>\nthat once agreed upon provide an internal measure of conduct. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf after careful consideration we adopt a principle, we internalize it<br/>\nand thoughtfully apply it to countless situations throughout our life.<br/>\nThere is no external threat demanding our adherence, only our own<br/>\ninternal sense of right and wrong. Living by principles offers our<br/>\nchildren both the model of an ethical life and the opportunity to grow as<br/>\nethical and just individuals within themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrinciples can also help simplify our lives. A single sound principle,<br/>\nfully explored and sincerely adopted, alleviates the need for a multitude<br/>\nof rules. Rules proliferate because they are isolated and specific while<br/>\nprinciples are few, simple and basic, cutting to the ethical origin or<br/>\nfoundation of living in the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, if we live by the simple principle &quot;cause no harm,&quot; we<br/>\neliminate the need for countless rigid household rules and invite,<br/>\ninstead, creative thinking and problem solving. Suppose that a child<br/>\nwants to draw on the walls. If the rule is &quot;no drawing on the walls,&quot; the<br/>\nchild&#39;s choices are severely limited: draw on the wall and get in<br/>\ntrouble, or sacrifice her own creative impulse. Or, perhaps a creative<br/>\nchild will quickly decide that although walls are off limits, furniture,<br/>\ncomputer monitors or appliances may not be. One rule rapidly necessitates<br/>\nmultiple rules to cover all the possibilities a clever child might<br/>\nimagine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the principle is &quot;do no harm,&quot; however, that same creative child has a<br/>\nnumber of different choices, guided by a single principle and limited<br/>\nonly by her own imaginative problem solving. Choosing to live by<br/>\nprinciples, the whole family is able to help brainstorm for creative<br/>\nsolutions to her driving desire to draw on a grand scale. <br/>\n<br/>\nPrinciple-driven parents might explain that they don�t want paint ruined<br/>\nand the associated expense or labor of repainting. They might offer to<br/>\nput up a chalkboard, poster board, or craft paper, test and find truly<br/>\nwashable crayons, donate less-conspicuous wall space to creative<br/>\nexpression like a bedroom, closet or basement wall. Throughout this<br/>\nproblem solving process, parents act as their children&#39;s partners rather<br/>\nthan punishers, fostering peace and trust in the relationship and leaving<br/>\nthe child�s dreams and creativity intact.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrinciples apply to all, not just a few and not just those low down on<br/>\nthe hierarchical ladder because they are based on careful thought and<br/>\nconsent. As Ben Lovejoy pointed out in his seminar, rules are something<br/>\nto get around by clever thinking whereas principles are guidelines for<br/>\nlife. Sound principles, unlike rules, apply to everyone regardless of age<br/>\nor position because they represent the foundation of what&#39;s right and<br/>\nfair for all.  They demand thought and enable the flexibility necessary<br/>\nto ensure freedom for all family members, not just those �in charge.� <br/>\n<br/>\nFor parents, putting principles in place of rules provides the<br/>\nopportunity to model mindful living, problem solving and respect for<br/>\nothers. Principles enable us to forge strong and thoughtful connections<br/>\nwith our children as partners rather than adversaries, and they provide<br/>\nthe ethical foundation for living mindfully in the world rather than in<br/>\nisolation, coercion or compliance.<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n-------<br/>\n<br/>\n� Danielle Conger 2005</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9327,"nextTopicId":9332}}
