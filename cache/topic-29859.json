Just wanted to share a good unschooling article<br/>\nwith quotes from unschooled kids/teens and parents.   ~Kathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHey campers!<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of you talked to the UC Santa Cruz reporter who was doing the <br/>\narticle about unschooling. Well, here&#39;s the link to the article:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cityonahillpress.com/article.php?id=1037\">http://cityonahillpress.com/article.php?id=1037</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was pretty darn good except for one slightly mangled <br/>\nquote from me and the fact that she painted HSC and the campout as an <br/>\nunschooler&#39;s gathering. I sent her a clarification (see below). (I <br/>\nthought I had made it clear that it was a homeschoolers campout but <br/>\nthere would be many unschoolers there but I guess that got lost. I <br/>\nwas just excited that we&#39;d be in her neck of the woods and she could <br/>\ninterview people in person.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Subject: Re: unschooling article<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks Rachel! I&#39;ve read lots of articles on unschooling and yours <br/>\n&gt;was one of the best I&#39;ve ever seen! You really captured the essence <br/>\n&gt;and the enthusiasm of unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;One little clarification for the benefit of the Homeschool <br/>\n&gt;Association of California that sponsored the campout: HSC is not an <br/>\n&gt;unschooling organization but a support organization for all <br/>\n&gt;homeschoolers in CA and while many of the families there were <br/>\n&gt;unschoolers, it wasn&#39;t specifically an unschoolers gathering. HSC <br/>\n&gt;can be a little touchy about that!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But thanks for the fabulous article. It&#39;s great that you quoted so <br/>\n&gt;many kids. Did the article come out yesterday? Please let me know <br/>\n&gt;if there&#39;s any feedback or letters to the editor. Sometimes people <br/>\n&gt;have strong reactions!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 07:03 AM 2/14/2008, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Here is a link to the article on Unschooling.
