However, I&#39;m not opposed to homeschooling him once he hits say, first grade, I just KNOW right now, that he does very well at preschool-he &#39;s better suited for it then my daughter was which is why I&#39;m going to unschool HER for now. He really does need the speech therapy that the schools provide right now and he made amazing progress in prek last year and really started to blossom with his social and speech skills. <br/>\n    Also, since I&#39;m a new homeschooling mom this year, I want to make sure it&#39;s something that I can really do before I bring my son into it. Anyway, my son will be at home with us every morning-its only a half day pre k he&#39;ll be going to and I plan on incorporating him into all aspects of our mornings. <br/>\n  Jen L.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle/Melbrigða &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamperedmichelle@...\">pamperedmichelle@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">           On 8/5/06, jenjen71379 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jenjen71379@...\">jenjen71379@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m Jen Long, 27 year old married stay at home mom.

So, I have no problem sending Joey to an <br/>\nafternoon preschool where he will be getting his therapy and daily <br/>\ninteraction with some typical peers. Courtney on the other hand, has <br/>\nalways been anxious about school. She has some sensory issues going <br/>\non, loud noises bother her, teachers who yell obviously scare the <br/>\npants off of her, fire drills, etc... She&#39;s also, we think, behind <br/>\nabout a year emotionally and socially. She ACTS alot more innocent <br/>\nabout things than her typical peers. So we have decided that they<br/>\n best environment for her would be keeping her home this year and <br/>\nseeing how it goes.<br/>\nCourtney I believe fits an unschooler to a T. When she&#39;s interested <br/>\nin something, she dives into it. This summer, she was soooo into <br/>\nMummies. She liked to look at pictures of them and we ended up <br/>\nrenting a couple of documentaries about them-some specifically made <br/>\nfor kids, some for anyone and we all watched them together. Then, I <br/>\nran across a website about Zoobooks (a animal magazine) and so I <br/>\nsubscribed and when she got her first issue on Apes, she devoured <br/>\nit! lol We LOVE that she likes to learn in this way. Her father also <br/>\nloved learning things about different animals and stuff when he was <br/>\na kid-he said he would just see something on TV or read a book, and <br/>\nhe would instantly want books about sharks, foxes, ocean life, <br/>\netc... just cuz it fascinated him. He&#39;s also an airbrush artist and <br/>\nwe can see alot of that coming out in Courtney too-she&#39;s going to a <br/>\nhalf day art camp this summer and she enjoys it alot-she likes <br/>\ncreating things.<br/>\nI&#39;m hoping thru this list, I can get some good ideas for how to <br/>\nstart our unschooling journey. I&#39;d also LOVE to connect with some <br/>\nlocal families in Rhode Island. <br/>\nThanks!!<br/>\nJen Long<br/>\nCranston, RI</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16262,"nextTopicId":16295}}
