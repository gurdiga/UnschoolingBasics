I&#39;d like to <br/>\ntry to show this movie for free at our local public library friends <br/>\nroom open to the public, and with an email invitation to members of a <br/>\nlocal alternative learning exchange group we started in our area.   We <br/>\nhave shown some movies at the library to this group and the public <br/>\nwithin the last year, and have had a table at a couple of local <br/>\nSustainable Living fairs where we showed books we wanted to share with <br/>\npeople, including John Taylor Gatto&#39;s  books, Llewellyn&#39;s &quot;Teenage <br/>\nLiberation Handbook&quot;, old copies of Growing Without Schooling <br/>\nNewsletter and John Holt&#39;s books.  One of Gatto&#39;s books has a section <br/>\nby Pat Farenga, John Holt&#39;s successor.   And we included the Sudbury <br/>\nphilosophy and &quot;Summerhill&quot;, among some others.    So we are initiating <br/>\ndialog and gathering together concerned parents with kids, a lot of <br/>\nthem in the public school system who want to get out.   And a few <br/>\nunschooling families have come to our meetings.    Due to our public <br/>\ninvolvement and holding meetings at the public library, a couple of <br/>\nlearning projects have gotten started in our area, which are very close <br/>\nto what I would call collective unschooling.    My husband and I see <br/>\nvalue to all learning experimentation and our own conclusion from our <br/>\nexperience with homeschooling was that the freer the kids are the <br/>\nbetter it is for them.    If any of you have suggestions on how to <br/>\nreach the public and get the word out that there are options, and how <br/>\nunschooling can be shared in a community, I&#39;d be happy to hear them.   <br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 18, 2006, at 12:05 PM, Chris wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Amy Mason &lt;doodlemakers@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; As long as you aren&#39;t offended by language, crude humor etc...that<br/>\n&gt;  comes<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; along with teen movies, you have got to see &quot;Accepted&quot;!
