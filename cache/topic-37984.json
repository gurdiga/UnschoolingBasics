So we make worksheets, learning books, etc available. It isn&#39;t her father that is the issue for us it is her grandfather, upon whom the sun rises and sets, that keeps asking about her going back to school. But not because of academics he has seen and does appreciate the amount of learning she is accomplishing, but because he thinks she needs more socialization. It still makes it difficult, a difficult age to begin with. I have flat out told my dad to express his opinions to us the parents and not necessarily to her. It shakes her confidence in her ability to be &quot;normal&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are pretty eclectic but are moving more and more into unschooling. It is of course easier with our 4 yr old, he hasn&#39;t been to public school. For him this is the status quo. The beauty of it all is since she feels more comfortable right now with traditional teaching we can do that, not every day we do plenty of outings that we have a blast doing. The end of the day my daughter will look at me or her father and realize she spent the whole day learning. We are also learning to relax and let nature take its course. It is an entire family transition from traditional parenting and schooling, but the more we relax and let things just happen the more the kids relax and I think in the near future it will all be good.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if we notice she is struggling with a subject we will give her more information on that subject or specific topic. It takes her a bit to digest it all. I guess give isn&#39;t quite the correct word but we make the information available would be a better statement. If she wants some kind of assessment on her work we give it to her. De-schooling is a long process, at least it has been for us. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your daughter wants school work no harm in making it available. It is what she is used to and getting the idea that we can learn outside the classroom setting is hard concept for children as well as adults. Especially in a society that tells you you will get no where with going to school and getting a college education so that we can all be good little robots and do as we are told. She will see the benefits of life learning soon.

They had some full primary middle school and hich school curiculum softwear packs at the half price books  a while back that we bought when we were in an educational software phase.

Is there <br/>\nsomething a child that has been conditioned to believe in school could <br/>\nread to gain insight into the idea that she&#39;s truly learning every <br/>\nday?  She really thinks she needs to be in a classroom or least using <br/>\ntextbooks to &quot;learn&quot;.  It makes me very sad :(  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe also has her dad (my ex), that is completely against homeschooling, <br/>\nconstantly asking her what school-work she has done.  Any suggested <br/>\nreading or thoughts for an 11 year old totally sold by the idea that <br/>\nlearning is only accomplished in the classroom or by reading a <br/>\ntextbook?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37775,"nextTopicId":38074}}
