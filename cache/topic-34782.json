He gets shy and quiet around new people - which is normal. I<br/>\nwas the same way growing up. But he wants to improve in this area.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can I help him?

We go shopping and are out & about.<br/>\nAny other ideas would be greatly appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could be writing about Cameron at 15-ish.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe rarely spoke. He was a bit uncomfortable. He wanted to be more <br/>\nsocial. He tended to sit back and watch, saying little.  Just kind of <br/>\n&quot;absorbing&quot; things. That&#39;s the way he does almost all things though. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt; He sits back and absorbs and then suddenly EXPLODES!<br/>\n<br/>\nBen and I chose to be strong examples: always smiling, holding out our <br/>\nhands, and introducing ourselves and him. We spoke *for* him a <br/>\nlot---until he was ready. We talked about what to expect *before* and <br/>\nkind of talked about what happened *afterwards*. About how he/we <br/>\nhandles things and how he/we could do better.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe entertain a LOT. So he got a lot of modeling there too. How to set <br/>\nthe house: mood, food, hosting. It&#39;s easier for *me* to host others in <br/>\nmy own home than to go to strangers&#39; homes---but we do a lot of that <br/>\ntoo! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut suddenly, when he was 18, I guess, *he* was introducing *us* to all <br/>\nthese new people. He had started playing drums and was working downtown <br/>\nwith several bands. One night, we had gone to see him at Mac&#39;s, and we <br/>\nwere astounded to watch him work the crowds!<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember: Ben and I were standing on the sidewalk in front of Mac&#39;s <br/>\non Main, and we looked over to see him working the crowd, shaking <br/>\nhands, and handing out his business cards. He knew *everyone* in town! <br/>\nWe were shocked! When did that happen?? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is to be as social as *you* can be so that he can have a <br/>\ngood role model.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut not everyone IS social! And I don&#39;t think everyone *needs* to be. <br/>\nBut if he *wants* to be, help him by setting up situations where he can <br/>\n*be* social. Start at home, if that&#39;s comfortable for him. Have a party <br/>\nor two. Or go TO parties. Put yourselves in situations to be social. <br/>\nTalk about what to expect before and &quot;debrief&quot; afterwards. Role-play, <br/>\nmaybe (I don&#39;t do that well, but I guess it works for some people! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nExperience is really helpful in almost all situations, but particularly <br/>\nwith this! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":315240425,"authorName":"Shannon","from":"&quot;Shannon&quot; &lt;dragteine76@...&gt;","profile":"dragteine76","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Social skills?","postDate":"1217141106","msgId":34812,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUzRENGNTdFOTlCMjRBOUVCMkE5MjkyRDU3RkUxMTlBQGRlbGw2Yzk5NzBhNDZjPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ1NkYyRUI4LTM0QUQtNEM5OS05Njg4LUM4MTAxNDA5ODdEQkBtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc2ZjY0ZCtkamkxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDU2RjJFQjgtMzRBRC00Qzk5LTk2ODgtQzgxMDE0MDk4N0RCQG1hYy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34810,"nextInTopic":34817,"prevInTime":34811,"nextInTime":34813,"topicId":34782,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"As a shy flirt myself. there is a trick someone taut me years and years ago.
