One of the concerned moms lives in  <br/>\na home with no television. They raise all their own meat. The family  <br/>\nlives on a very modest budget and don&#39;t see movies, go to the mall,  <br/>\nthings like that. But I thought later about what her kids are _not_  <br/>\nsheltered from. They&#39;re not sheltered from the reality of where their  <br/>\nfood comes from: they raise the turkeys and lambs, see them delivered  <br/>\nto the butcher, and eat them out of the freezer all year long.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re not sheltered from economic reality, as they see their  <br/>\nparents making hard choices about finances; the family has been  <br/>\nliving without hot water for some weeks now while they work on  <br/>\nreplacing a worn-out hot water heater, for instance. How many kids  <br/>\nwho are &quot;in the world&quot; more are so in touch with the economic  <br/>\nimplications of normal crises like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing this family does is bring the children into all of those  <br/>\ndecisions, or at least make them visible to the kids. The whole  <br/>\nfamily recently had a discussion about whether to get TV, for  <br/>\ninstance. You could argue that the discussion was a bit loaded, since  <br/>\nall the kids know about TV is what their parents have told them, but  <br/>\nthey talked very concretely about what they would give up in terms of  <br/>\nthe money to have TV and the time spent watching, and decided not to  <br/>\nget TV at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids know that the reason they don&#39;t have hot water right now is  <br/>\nbecause they don&#39;t have the money right now. They expect to have hot  <br/>\nwater back in the house by fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe family lives a certain kind of life. Very different from my  <br/>\nfamily&#39;s, certainly. But both of us share a goal of integrating kids  <br/>\ninto the economy of the household, not having secrets, letting them  <br/>\nsee how we live our lives. That&#39;s not sheltered, I don&#39;t think, in  <br/>\nthe sense that it will leave kids unprepared to cope.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure that exactly speaks to your concern, but it&#39;s what I&#39;ve been  <br/>\nthinking about this week.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu<br/>\n<br/>\nmom of Eric, 6, and Carl, 3</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160045678,"authorName":"seccotine_ch","from":"&quot;seccotine_ch&quot; &lt;seccotine@...&gt;","profile":"seccotine_ch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Over protecting ???","postDate":"1182715814","msgId":24679,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1bWozNitsanAzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24680,"prevInTime":24678,"nextInTime":24680,"topicId":24679,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello everyone I haven t benn there for a while , but the academic term is over and I turn back to you with pleasure and relief (I don t know many people ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1410228170\">Hello everyone<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t benn there for a while , but the academic term is over and <br/>\nI turn back to you with pleasure and relief (I don&#39;t know many people <br/>\nfavorable to unschooling ...)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sisters, in particular, don&#39;t understand what we are doing. I had <br/>\nan awful discussion with one of them and my brother-in-law ... I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to convince them, I just wanted them to trust me, to give <br/>\nmy husband and I some credit about the decisions we take for our own <br/>\nfamily. I thought after that discussion that I should simply tell <br/>\nthem to get information about unschooling before deciding that I&#39;m <br/>\nabout to turn my children into criminal or idiots. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had another discussion, though, which made me think and I would <br/>\nlike to have your always-appreciated-opinion about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI discussed with another sister of mine who told me how worried she <br/>\nwas about her younger daughter, who is 14. According to my sister, my <br/>\nniece only do things when she is obliged to. For instance : she is <br/>\nsupposed to wash the dishes when she is alone at noon and doesn&#39;t do <br/>\nit, doesn&#39;t thank my sister when she washes them for her; the evening <br/>\nbefore, she was talking on the phone and she went on talking even <br/>\nthough my sister asked her to join them for the evening meal, but <br/>\nwhen my brother-in-law said, very drily &quot;You have 30 seconds&quot;, she <br/>\nhang up the phone ... She had troubles at school because she didn&#39;t <br/>\ndo her homeworks and had an attitude with her teachers;  until my <br/>\nsister and her husband decided to punish her for every bad remark on <br/>\nher &quot;carnet&quot; by diminishing her pocket-money, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI deeply disagree with the measures and the tone, and the <br/>\nwhole &quot;repressive&quot; thing. Actually, my sister didn&#39;t really believe <br/>\nin it either, she is the more understanding of my three sisters about <br/>\nmy educational choices, the fact that I still breastfeed my little <br/>\none, that she still sleeps in our room, that I don&#39;t spank my kids, <br/>\netc. (but not the fact that I don&#39;t send them to school ;p).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that it works : my niece does have better grades, and <br/>\na more appropriate behaviour, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t like to give you the wrong feeling about my sister, who is <br/>\na very concerned mother, who deeply love her kids and who would <br/>\nprotect them over her life ... but she can be hard, sometimes, <br/>\nprimarily with herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister doesn&#39;t like being hard with her daughter, but when she <br/>\nsees that her behavior has changed, she asks herself if she hasn&#39;t <br/>\nbeen over-protective with her after her father&#39;s suicide. She is <br/>\nconvinced that over-protecting children is not good for them, that it <br/>\nis part of our parenting job to let them have bad experiences, that <br/>\nwe can&#39;t avoid it and that, if we try to keep them safe at all cost, <br/>\nthey will turn into &quot;dysfunctional&quot; adults - and she can give me some <br/>\nexamples which, I have to say, are a bit frightening. We decided, at <br/>\nthe end of our talk, that kids needed some sort of protection, but <br/>\nthat, sometimes, parents are protecting themselves more than their <br/>\nkids, taking more care of their own fears than of their child <br/>\ndevelopmental needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, after that discussion I was wondering if I was not too <br/>\nperfectionist in keeping my children away from the school experience <br/>\nand if I wasn&#39;t &quot;over-protecting&quot; them. I am the one who thinks that <br/>\nschool isn&#39;t a good environment for kids ... but maybe my kids NEED <br/>\nto be away from me and to experiment not-so-good environment to grow <br/>\nstronger ? <br/>\n<br/>\n(As I writing it, I realize that it doesn&#39;t make sense, but I would <br/>\nlike to read you about this anyway, really).
