While he played in the garden with her <br/>\ntwo children, John and Dona Ana, she interviewed him for the bimonthly magazine <br/>\nMothering.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is your philosophy of learning?<br/>\nBasically that the human animal is a learning animal; we like to learn; we need to learn; we <br/>\nare good at it; we don&#39;t need to be shown how or made to do it. made to do it. What kills <br/>\nthe processes are the people interfering with it or trying to regulate it or control it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy homeschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a big question. The great advantage is intimacy, control of your time, flexibility of <br/>\nschedule, and the ability to respond to the needs of the child, and to the inclinations. If <br/>\nthe child is feeling kind of tired or out of sorts, or a little bit sick, or kind of droopy in <br/>\nspirits, okay, we take it easy, and things go along very calmly and easily. When the child is <br/>\nfull of energy and rambunctious, then we tackle big projects, we try tough stuff, we look at <br/>\nhard books. And I think schools could do much more than they do in this kind of <br/>\nflexibility, but in fact they don&#39;t. I want to make it clear that I don&#39;t see homeschooling as <br/>\nsome kind of answer to badness of schools. I think that the home is the proper base for <br/>\nthe exploration of the world which we call learning or education. Home would be the best <br/>\nbase no matter how good the schools were. The proper relationship of the schools to <br/>\nhome is the relationship of the library to home, or the skating rink to home. It is a <br/>\nsupplementary resource.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the school is a kind of artificial institution, and the home is a very natural one. There <br/>\nare lots of societies without schools, but never any without homes. Home is the center of <br/>\nthe circle from which you move out in all directions, so there is no conceivable <br/>\nimprovement in schools that would change my mind about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does one do at a homeschool?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what Growing Without Schooling is about, of course. What one can do depends a lot <br/>\non what one&#39;s own life is. A lot of families have small businesses or subsistence farms or <br/>\ncrafts, or various kinds of activities that the parents are involved in, which the children are <br/>\nalso very involved in. The children just partake in the life of the adults wherever they are, <br/>\nand then questions are answered as they come up. Other people may live at home and <br/>\nwork somewhere else; they may have a more conventional kind of existence.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe in formal fixed curriculums, but it may very well be that when parents and <br/>\nchildren start off, they&#39;re both a little nervous. They&#39;re both wondering what they should <br/>\nbe doing. If it makes people feel happier to have a little schedule, and to work with a <br/>\ncorrespondence school for a year or so, kind of as a security blanket, there&#39;s nothing <br/>\nwrong with that. It&#39;s a starting place.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice is always to let the interests and the inclinations of the children determine what <br/>\nhappens and to give children access to as much of the parents&#39; lives and the world around <br/>\nthem as possible, given your own circumstances, so that children have the widest possible <br/>\nrange of things to look at and think about. See which things interest them most, and help <br/>\nthem to go down that particular road.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow that&#39;s done depends very much on the family&#39;s circumstances and their interests, and <br/>\nthe particular interests of the children. Some kids are bookish, some children like to build <br/>\nthings, some are more mathematical or computerish, or artistic, or musical, or whatever. <br/>\nThe mix is never going to be exactly the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes homeschooling require that the parents spend a great deal of structured time with <br/>\ntheir children in a formal learning situation?<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling doesn&#39;t require that parents spend a great deal of structured time. I think <br/>\nas parents get into this they tend to spend less time. How much time they spend with their <br/>\nkids depends a little on the circumstances in their own lives. Sometimes they spend a lot <br/>\nof time in company together just because it&#39;s fun. Other times that&#39;s harder for them to <br/>\ndo. The children, though they may enjoy a lot of their parents&#39; company during the day, <br/>\ndon&#39;t need it once they get past 7 or 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the parent without background in education or experience as a teacher at a <br/>\ndisadvantage in a homeschooling situation?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say they have a very great advantage. I wouldn&#39;t say that a person was disqualified <br/>\nfrom doing it because they had had training in education, but I would have to say that <br/>\npractically everything they taught you at that school of education is just plain wrong. You <br/>\nhave to unlearn it all. I never had any of that educational training. The most exclusive, <br/>\nselective, demanding private schools in this country do not hire people who have <br/>\neducation degrees. If you look through their faculties - degrees in history, mathematics, <br/>\nEnglish, French, whatever - you will not see degrees in education. I think for the most <br/>\nprestigious private schools you could almost set it down as a fact that to have a teacher&#39;s <br/>\ncertificate, to have had that kind of training, would disqualify you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre parents talented or knowledgeable enough to teach physics or math?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, well, the children don&#39;t have to learn physics or math from you. There are plenty of <br/>\npeople to learn from; there are plenty of books; there are plenty of extension courses. <br/>\nGWS will have information on that. There are plenty of other people to answer your <br/>\nquestions. And the children don&#39;t have to get it all from Mom and Pop. There are people <br/>\nwho have only high schooling, or may not even have finished that, who are now teaching <br/>\ntheir children at home and doing a very good job of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about the child&#39;s social life?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for friends Â– you&#39;re not going to lock your kids in the house. I think the socializing <br/>\naspects of school are ten times as likely to be harmful as helpful. The human virtues - <br/>\nkindness, patience, generosity, etc. are learned by children in intimate relationships, <br/>\nmaybe groups of two or three. By and large, human beings tend to behave worse in large <br/>\ngroups, like you find in school. There they learn something quite different - popularity, <br/>\nconformity, bullying, teasing, things like that. They can make friends after school hours, <br/>\nduring vacations, at the library, in church.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about the opportunity for youths to meet members of other backgrounds, other <br/>\nsocioeconomic classes?<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the schools that I know anything about are tracked - there would be a college <br/>\ntrack, and a business track, and a vocational track. Studies have shown over the years that <br/>\nthese tracks correlate perfectly with economic class. I think I know enough about most <br/>\nhigh schools in this country to say there is very little mingling of people from different <br/>\nbackgrounds, different religious groups. The rich kids hang out with the rich kids, the <br/>\njocks hang out with the jocks, the pointy heads hang out with the pointy heads, the <br/>\ngreasers hang out with the greasers. Maybe there are some exceptions to that . . . but the <br/>\nidea of school as a social melting pot where people of all kinds of backgrounds get <br/>\ntogether - pure mythology, folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is your philosophy about teaching reading?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the teaching of reading is mostly what prevents reading. Different children learn <br/>\ndifferent ways. I think reading aloud is fun, but I would never read aloud to a kid so that <br/>\nthe kid would learn to read. You read aloud because it&#39;s fun and companionable. You hold <br/>\na child, sitting next to you or on your lap, reading this story that you&#39;re having fun with, <br/>\nand if it isn&#39;t a cozy, happy, warm, friendly, loving experience, then you shouldn&#39;t do it. It <br/>\nisn&#39;t going to do any good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think children are attracted toward the adult world. It&#39;s nice to have children&#39;s books, but <br/>\nfar too many of them have too much in the way of pictures. When children see books, as <br/>\nthey do in the family where the adults read, with pages and pages and pages of print, it <br/>\nbecomes pretty clear that if you&#39;re going to find out what&#39;s in those books, you&#39;re going to <br/>\nhave to read from that print. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any way to make reading interesting to <br/>\nchildren in a family in which it isn&#39;t interesting to adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat your philosophy about math?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy approach to math is to say, What do we adults use numbers for? We use them to <br/>\nmeasure things. And we measure things so that having measured them we can do things <br/>\nwith them, or make certain judgements about them. And so I say let children do with <br/>\nnumbers what we do with numbers. I&#39;m a great believer in many kinds of measuring <br/>\ninstruments - tapes (centimeter tape, inch tapes, rolls of tapes), rulers, scales, <br/>\nthermometers, barometers, metronomes, electric metronomes with lights flashing on and <br/>\noff that you can make go faster and slower, stopwatches, things for time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is money. Kids are fascinated by money. We all say: &quot;We&#39;ll have to teach <br/>\nthem all this arithmetic so that some day they can deal with money.&quot; I think dealing with <br/>\nmoney is inherently interesting to children. I say family finances ought to be out on the <br/>\ntable, charts on the wall: expenses, food, taxes, insurance, health care, how much this <br/>\ncosts, how much it cost last year. I think actually, like typing, double-entry bookkeeping <br/>\nand basic accounting are fascinating skills, and if you&#39;re talking about basics, those are <br/>\nbasics.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fundamental idea of double-entry bookkeeping, the distinction between your income <br/>\nand expenses and assets and liabilities is one of the really beautiful inventions of the <br/>\nhuman mind. It&#39;s fabulous the way it works, and I think families should do their finances <br/>\nas if they were a little teeny corporation with income and expenses and assets and <br/>\nliabilities and depreciation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids might get to the point where they would want to be the family treasurer and <br/>\nkeep the family books and balance the checkbook. This is all really &quot;big adult stuff.&quot; Let <br/>\nthe child write out the checks that are paying the bills, instead of the harassed picture, you <br/>\nknow, of father with his tie untied, sitting at the desk and papers all over the place. Why? <br/>\nThis is inherently interesting, so let&#39;s at least make this part of our life - like every other <br/>\npart - accessible to children. The best way to meet numbers is in real life, as everything <br/>\nelse. It&#39;s embedded in the context of reality, and what schooling does is to try to take <br/>\neverything out of the context of reality. So everything appears like some little thing <br/>\nfloating around in space, and it&#39;s a terrible mistake. You know, there are numbers in <br/>\nbuilding; there are numbers in construction; there are numbers in business; there are <br/>\nnumbers in photography; there are numbers in music; there are fractions in cooking. So <br/>\nwherever numbers are in real life, then let&#39;s go and meet them and work with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat subject matter do you see as essential?<br/>\n<br/>\nNone.*<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about the parent who works outside of the home?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne question which often comes up is &quot;How am I going to teach my kids six hours a day?&quot; <br/>\nAnd I respond to that by saying, &quot;Who&#39;s teaching your kids six hours a day now?&quot; I was a <br/>\ngood student in supposedly the best schools and it was a rare day that I got five minutes <br/>\nof teaching... that&#39;s five minutes of somebody&#39;s serious attention to my personal needs, <br/>\ninterests, concerns, difficulties, problems. Like most other kids in school, I learned that if <br/>\nyou don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on, for heaven&#39;s sake, keep your mouth shut. What <br/>\nhappens when children become ill, or have an injury, etc.? Home teachers come in for <br/>\nthree to five hours a week. It has been found that this is perfectly sufficient. These <br/>\nchildren don&#39;t fall behind. No child needs, or should stand, six hours of teaching a day, <br/>\neven if a parent were of a mind to give it. It would drive them up the wall!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow are homeschoolers evaluated when they go to enroll at the university level?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like anyone else. You know, there are these tests you can take... the College Boards, <br/>\nthe SAT, and so forth. Actually, homeschoolers do exceptionally well on these things. <br/>\nThey&#39;re more motivated to learn what areas will be covered, and prepare for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it sometimes happen that a homeschooling student will express a desire to go to or <br/>\nreturn to traditional schooling? How do parents handle this?<br/>\n<br/>\nVarious ways. Sometimes parents have to decide (we&#39;re the grownups) that we don&#39;t want <br/>\nthem to go back to that school, and then stick with it. But other times, if the children want <br/>\nto go, then that means they&#39;re immune to the manipulation the schools can do with the <br/>\nchildren who don&#39;t have a choice about whether they have to be there or not. The school <br/>\nloses some of its power when the children know they can quit if they want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=--=--=--=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n* Once when John Holt was speaking to a school audience, describing his views on the <br/>\ntheir structured curriculum, a student asked him, &quot;But surely there must be something <br/>\nimportant enough that everyone should learn it?&quot; He thought for a moment and replied, <br/>\n&quot;To learn to say `I&#39;m sorry&#39;, `I don&#39;t know&#39;, and `I was wrong&#39;.&quot; [unpublished anecdote]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19791,"nextTopicId":19817}}
