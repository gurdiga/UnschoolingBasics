What I actually found was a group of <br/>\nunschoolers and I jumped in with both feet.  Problem is that most <br/>\npeople are fine with unschooling young kids but move to a much more <br/>\nstructured approach (usually at the insistence of DH) at around 9, so <br/>\nall the kids in the group were quite young.  My 2 oldest kids had no <br/>\none to hang out with and wanted to spend time with the kids they met in <br/>\nthe first group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, I re-joined the first group.  I was very up front and open with <br/>\nthe leaders about who are family is and what we are and asked if it <br/>\nwould be a problem.  They assured me it wasn&#39;t a problem and the few <br/>\ntimes it has been a problem with other members, the leaders have backed <br/>\nme up 100%.  I have made friends in the group and admittedly they think <br/>\nI&#39;m a bit wacky but we seek out each other to spend time with <br/>\noccassionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now we simply belong to two groups, one in which I am the norm and <br/>\none in which I am very much the odd-ball.

For","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-811916968\">I&#39;m fortunate to have been with the same friends for a while now.  <br/>\nPerhaps you can keep your eyes/ears open to certain types of <br/>\nhomeschooling programs.  For example, if textbook programs such as <br/>\nCalvert, Abeka and BJU are being discussed, those types of <br/>\nhomeschoolers are usually very structured.  But if you hear of <br/>\nprograms like Oak Meadow, Sonlight, Charlotte Mason, and Winter <br/>\nPromise, those homeschoolers are generally a bit more relaxed.  <br/>\nPeople who use Unit Studies can go both ways.  I&#39;ve seen some very <br/>\nstructured families using Unit Studies, and some very relaxed <br/>\nfamilies as well.  If that makes any sense.  But anyway, if you can <br/>\nencourage friendships with the people who are using slightly more <br/>\nrelaxed materials, you might find some common ground.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may just be a slow-going mission.  Chances are you&#39;ll find <br/>\nsomeone who wants to be more relaxed but is surrounded by die-hard <br/>\nstructured homeschoolers and feels the need to keep up with the <br/>\njoneses.  That describes me to a &quot;T&quot;.  I am more confident now and <br/>\nhave real friends who care more about me than about how I homeschool <br/>\nmy children.  In fact, one of my best friends who has been an even <br/>\nbigger curriculum junkie than me is moving towards unschooling <br/>\nthough she&#39;s still fighting it somewhat.  She&#39;s met an unschooler <br/>\nand is extremely inspired by their family.  And now that I&#39;ve gone <br/>\nback to unschooling, it just provides more support for her.  It&#39;s <br/>\nnot good to jump in with both feet sometimes.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also try starting some different conversations.  Ask about <br/>\nfavorite educational software, or book recommendations for pleasure <br/>\nreading.  Begin a conversation about Science exploration for young <br/>\nchildren ala Charlotte Mason, i.e. nature walks.  It seems that even <br/>\nvery structured homeschoolers feel it&#39;s okay to be relaxed in <br/>\nScience in the early years though of course you may get some <br/>\nrecommendations of curriculums.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":232225755,"authorName":"jsnhawkins","from":"&quot;jsnhawkins&quot; &lt;jsnhawkins@...&gt;","profile":"jsnhawkins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"I just don&#39;t fit in (locally)","postDate":"1146923614","msgId":12809,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUzaTlvdSsyaDl2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12810,"prevInTime":12808,"nextInTime":12810,"topicId":12809,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve been HSing (unschooling) for a couple of months now and we ve met several other HSing families in various ways.

This has led to some<br/>\nfun activites for DS (such as our local group goes to the park every<br/>\nFri for playtime). However, it just makes me feel like one big<br/>\noutcast.

I don&#39;t have much to add since obviously we don&#39;t<br/>\nutilize those things in our house.
