I don&#39;t think making a foreign <br/>\nlanguage important in the early years is necessary. The only way to <br/>\ntruly learn a language is total immersion.<br/>\nSo unless you or your partner speak another language, your children <br/>\naren&#39;t going to get fluent anyway. Just treat foreign languages like <br/>\neverything else, something to explore.<br/>\nI think if they HEAR foreign sounds at a young age, it&#39;s easier to <br/>\npick it up if they choose to immerse themselves one day. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4123,"nextTopicId":4125}}
