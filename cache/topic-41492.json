Who does benefit from being spanked?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know!  Hookers who get paid to let guys spank them! (I wonder how much you can charge for that?  That could be a new work from home scheme!))   Spanking is the special word we have for repeatedly slapping someone on the butt but if we could include other slapping then who benefits from being slapped?  In old movies, hysterical women got slapped.  It did seem to calm them down.    I wonder if it would benefit my husband to be slapped when he doesn&#39;t do what I want him to do.  What would those benefits be? (I wonder how long he&#39;d stand there and let me slap him?)  I wonder if my old mom would benefit from a slap or forty? (hold on!)  My boss waited on an annoying customer yesterday and I wonder if that customer would have benefited from some slapping.   (My boss might have felt some momentary satisfaction if she had slapped her!  Until the cops arrived.) <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a weird world when a mom worries video games or TV might hurt her kid but somehow believes being hit by the person a child loves and trusts the most has benefits. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"Karen Swanay &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Spanking study on CNN","postDate":"1253137231","msgId":41492,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDkwOTE2MTQ0MGk2NWRmZDAzNWoyY2ZiOTZlMDJkOTI4OEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":41519,"prevInTime":41491,"nextInTime":41493,"topicId":41492,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Not news to anyone here...and not totally unschool-y but every little bit helps.
