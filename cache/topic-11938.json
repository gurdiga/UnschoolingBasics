They are content to live the way that they are living at this<br/>\npoint in their lives.  2 years ago I stopped requiring my kids to help.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t announce it by standing on a chair and shouting, &quot;YOU NO LONGER HAVE<br/>\nTO DO CHORES.&quot;  I just quit &quot;asking&quot; them to do it.  I realized that my<br/>\nchildren felt that they didn&#39;t have a choice to say no when I &quot;asked&quot; them<br/>\nto do something.  I&#39;m not sure why parents who don&#39;t give their children a<br/>\nchoice ask their children to do things. Why not just tell them, &quot;Do the<br/>\ndishes.&quot;  I&#39;ve noticed that parents who &quot;ask&quot; their children to do something<br/>\nand the child exercises their free will to not do that thing will then say,<br/>\n&quot;I ASKED you to do that and you disobeyed me.&quot;  Hmmmm.  Asking equates to<br/>\nrequirement.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone on this list challenged me to quit making them do chores.  So I<br/>\ndid.  And guess what?  Now when I DO need their help they are much more<br/>\ninclined to assist.  The other day I was cooking and I asked one of my<br/>\nchildren if she could run back and get something for me out of one of the<br/>\nbedrooms.  She asked if she could wait for a commercial and I said, &quot;Don&#39;t<br/>\nworry.  I&#39;ll go get it.  I thought I heard you walking down the hall.&quot;<br/>\n(Which I did - must have heard something else).  I went and got it myself.<br/>\nI needed that thing right then and so I got what I was cooking stirred and<br/>\nwent and got what I needed.  I grew up in a family that if my mom had<br/>\n&quot;asked&quot; me to go get her something she meant right now, drop everything that<br/>\nyou are doing no matter how important it is and do it pronto.  Even giving a<br/>\nchild a delay still does not give a child a choice.

It<br/>\nis around their age per paycheck.  Keon can easily be the richest or the<br/>\npoorest member of the house depending on if he remembers that he has money.<br/>\nMary Elayen is a saver.

Emily *can*<br/>\nhave goals and save to meet them but she is very much an impulse shopper.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe chose dollar per age as a guideline, but the kids are always finding ways<br/>\nto earn more money.  So if Mary Elayne, for instance, bargains with me to<br/>\nclean my hobby area and wash all my rubber stamps for $2 (a bargain in my<br/>\nopinion) then she could easily end up having more money than her siblings<br/>\nput together.  And then we have the &quot;Name  Ever Changing Restaurant&quot; which<br/>\nthe kids run from time to time where they charge 50¢ for drinks (including<br/>\nwater - &quot;But madam, the water is filtered.  We do not serve that nasty tap<br/>\nwater here!&quot;) and meals are generally $1.  I&#39;m still trying to figure out<br/>\nhow come I have to pay for food that I bought and (much of the time)<br/>\nprepared.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne things the kids have come to realize is that if there is something that<br/>\nthey *really* want, that they can come to us to work out a way to get it.<br/>\nWhether it is a CD or a television set.  We will help them earn that money<br/>\nor contribute to their fund to help them get it.  The kids recently wanted<br/>\nto buy Kingdom Hearts II (a video game) and it was $50.  They pooled their<br/>\nmoney together and were still $10 short.  I agreed to purchase ownership<br/>\nrights into the game.  So I own 20% of the game :)  I think that means if I<br/>\ncan ever complete KH1 that I can play this game.

Dylan uses his money for things he wants to purchase<br/>\nhimself, books, cd&#39;s, games.  He chooses what he&#39;s going to pay for, I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t set the guidelines.  It&#39;s his money and I don&#39;t tell him how or<br/>\nwhen or in what way he has to spend or save.   If he&#39;s out and wants to<br/>\nstop for a Coke, he uses his money.   He is also very generous with his<br/>\nmoney and if we stop so he can grab a snack before heading out for a<br/>\ndrive he&#39;ll return to the car with something for everyone else, too.   <br/>\n<br/>\nLast week I saw the sweetest little desk in an antique store window and<br/>\nwent in to see how much it was.  I still feel like poking my eyes out,<br/>\ndays later, but in spite of my horror at the price, Dylan said he had<br/>\nmore than enough in his savings account if I&#39;d like to use that to get<br/>\nthe desk.    This is a boy who is saving for a car and will be getting<br/>\nhis license in a little over a year.  He has plans for his money, yet was<br/>\ngenerous enough to offer it to me.   I believe his generosity to us and<br/>\nothers is, in part, a result of our generosity with him. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I want her to realize that she has responsibilities and obligations as<br/>\na member of a<br/>\nfamily (helping with chores) ***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen did she apply for the job?  ; )   Dylan didn&#39;t choose to come here<br/>\nto work.  But Dylan has a sense of responsibility as a family member and<br/>\nit grew out of living with (reasonably) responsible people.   After some<br/>\ntime of  living with us and seeing us clean up spills, etc.  he<br/>\neventually helped.  When he saw us take our plates to the sink he did<br/>\nlikewise.  We let him help when he wanted to, even though at first his<br/>\nhelp often meant extra work. &lt;g&gt;  We helped him and from that, and<br/>\nbecause he&#39;s a nice person, he wanted to help.   That&#39;s what humans do. <br/>\nIt&#39;s all part of learning naturally.      <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan (13) helps around the house a lot but not because he&#39;s required to.<br/>\n He helps because that&#39;s how we live, with a mind to helping each other<br/>\nand ourselves.  We all appreciate being comfortable and we all, at<br/>\ndifferent times and in different ways, make an effort to keep things<br/>\ncomfortable.   I am not a meticulous housekeeper.  My standards are<br/>\nlikely lower than the standards of others here, but we&#39;re not sticky or<br/>\ninfested or in danger of being condemned and we do the things that seem<br/>\nmost important at the moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs partners to Dylan we share the benefits of our lifestyle.   David and<br/>\nI were adults when we mutually agreed to a partnership so we came into<br/>\nthis relationship with free choice.  Dylan didn&#39;t get a choice and we<br/>\nbelieved the choice to help, as a member of the family, was his alone. <br/>\nSince we knew he was a nice person right from the start there was no real<br/>\nquestion as to whether he would someday choose to help where he saw a<br/>\nneed for it.   There is no way to make someone responsible; there is a<br/>\nchoice to live responsibly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may go against everything you&#39;ve ever heard about kids learning to<br/>\nhelp around the house, but you will hear similar stories from other<br/>\nunschoolers.  Children living with kind and helpful parents who are<br/>\nthoughtful and generous, will be children who are kind and helpful and<br/>\nthoughtful and generous.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":124939329,"authorName":"Ellen Christian","from":"Ellen Christian &lt;scentednights2002@...&gt;","profile":"scentednights2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] allowances","postDate":"1145105001","msgId":11973,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDE1MTI0MzIxLjg1MTc5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyNzEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11969,"nextInTopic":11977,"prevInTime":11972,"nextInTime":11974,"topicId":11938,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I doubt mine is the correct radical unschooling answer but here goes.

They are 13 and 8. They do get money for birthdays, holidays or special occasions like if we are going to a fair, etc.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  They do have responsibilities around the house, not a lot of them but some. I will ask my daughter (13) to occasionally help me with sweeping or laundry. My son (8) I ask occasionally to help with laundry or dusting.  They both help with work outside as needed.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My reasoning - no one pays me to clean this house or make meals, it&#39;s my responsibility as a member of this household. When they grow up no one is going to pay them to make their family&#39;s dinner or sweep the family&#39;s floors.  They live here & help get it dirty. They enjoy the &quot;fruits&quot; of our garden, etc. So they need to help out. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  The money they get given to them is theirs to spend as they wish. My son almost always spends his on Pokemon cards or Dragonball Z cards. My daughter usually spends hers on earrings, art supplies or posters. Neither of them generally chooses candy/junk but that is because they are allowed to eat it within reason at home. I say within reason because both have ADHD and too much sugar is not good for their behavior.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So just my .02<br/>\n  Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty Felner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:misty@...\">misty@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  Just wondering what you give her allowance for.

It tends to be based on what kinds of things you spend money on (candy exclusively vs. all personal products/outings/etc.)  Each of us has a set amount with a fudge factor built in.  Everyone is also expected to help out various ways.  Nothing major and terribly time consuming but it is expected.  Nothing is written in stone.  Everything is fluid and flexible but it is expected.  I think of it as a give an take kind of thing.  All of us take time and energy out of the family for various things, we need to all give some time and energy back. If a kid is not willing to put energy back into the family, I am less willing to give energy to that kid&#39;s activities.  I am having to give extra time and energy to the family to take up the slack.  If a kid is willing to help out, I will go above and beyond the call to help that kid do what they want.  My kids are in lots of activities that require lots of money and travel all over the state.  We <br/>\nare gone most weekends.  I enjoy watching the kids enjoy themselves but it does require a lot of time and energy to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarsie spends 100 percent of her allowance on food.  I pay for all her entertainment.  Adriane likes expensive shampoos and makeup so her allowance buys the brands she likes, plus outings with friends, etc.  So Adriane gets more money than Marsie.  If Marsie runs out of money and I have some, I&#39;m still likely to buy the gum she wants, just like she will spend her money and share with her siblings.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe try to think of how we do things as general guidelines for how things go, not rigid rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Misty Felner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:misty@...\">misty@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, April 14, 2006 2:19 pm<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] allowances<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; RE:  Marsie spent her allowance (not tied to chores)on candy that <br/>\n&gt; she shared<br/>\n&gt; with her siblings.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just wondering what you give her allowance for.
