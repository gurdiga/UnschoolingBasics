The only time I&#39;d use it <br/>\nis with other people that actually understood the term.  It&#39;s not <br/>\nlike we&#39;re throwing the term around in mainstream circles.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t go around to my friends at work and say &quot;I&#39;m a radical <br/>\nunschooler&quot;.<br/>\nI guess it&#39;s all phases. If someone doesn&#39;t understand much about <br/>\nhomeschooling, I just say &quot;we homeschool&quot;. If a person understands <br/>\nhomeschooling, I might say &quot;we unschool&quot;, if they understand <br/>\nunschooling, I might say &quot;we&#39;re radical unschoolers&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to make this concept clear, radical is a great term in my <br/>\nopinion.<br/>\nRadical: 1. Arising from or going to a root or source. 2a.Affecting <br/>\nthe basis of something; fundamental in its effect, a far reaching <br/>\naffect..<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you put radical unschooling in light of the definition of <br/>\nradical, it&#39;s the root of the philosophy (trust in children) which <br/>\nwe apply to ALL of life, not just education. Those that are radical <br/>\nunschoolers are staying close to the source of the philosophy in all <br/>\nthat they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, radical unschooler to the core and proud of it!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4125,"nextTopicId":4137}}
