I do not have a RAD child, but my oldest son has schizoaffective disorder and it&#39;s very interesting to read the challenges you have faced. I am about to try unschooling for the first time with my son who is 15. So I am really late to the game. I hope it is not too late.<br/>\n <br/>\n Dealing with the school system has been awful for a long time and I have thought of homeschooling often over the years. I have had to literally fight every single year just to get the schools to do what they are supposed to do. He has been in self contained special ed since 4th grade and this year, more than ever, it was clear that the school had decided that he was not capable of learning and had totally given up on him, to the point that my son was asked to leave school early every day because he was being bullied. When I asked why my son needed to leave early when he was not the one that was causing the problem and the teacher actually said, &quot;He isn&#39;t doing anything anyway so it doesn&#39;t matter if he is here or not&quot;. My son had been getting more and more depressed as this bullying escalated. When he bacame suicidal I went to the school to talk with the principal and she denied it was even happening (going so far as calling the other student to the<br/>\n office and asking him right in front of me if he as picking on my son. Of course he said no.)and refused to acknowledge the damage that was being done to my son. My son has not been back to school since then.<br/>\n <br/>\nHis doctor actually filed paperwork saying that school was causing to have an unstable mood and episodic depression. He is in the 9th grade and the doctor strongly urged me to find an alternative. I thought I would just homeschool. My son was totally against it. He did not want to return to regular school, but for him home is the place you go to get away from the bad stuff and to &quot;do school&quot; at home would be letting the bad stuff in there. So I researched and researched and came upon unschooling.I cannot say I fully understand all of it but I am learning all I can right now and hoping that I can eventually make it work for a kid who no longer gets any joy from learning.<br/>\n <br/>\nJennifer</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164496538,"authorName":"jonlebar","from":"jonlebar &lt;lebar20@...&gt;","profile":"wildnwoolyranch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] unschooling and foster children","postDate":"1273371666","msgId":43892,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4QUZBRDNBLTIzRDktNDRBRC05MDFGLUMwRDIwNDNDRTFDQUBnd3RjLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhycDFxYis2N3A1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhycDFxYis2N3A1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43874,"nextInTopic":43895,"prevInTime":43891,"nextInTime":43893,"topicId":43850,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi gem We have adopted lots of kids with RAD.

It&#39;s been an interesting  <br/>\njourney.  We had home schooled and then went on to unschooling and  <br/>\nthen ended up with several in school.  I&#39;ve figured out the main  <br/>\nproblem we&#39;ve had is that unschooling is based on relationships and  <br/>\ntrust.  It goes both ways.  WE, who don&#39;t have attachment issues,  <br/>\nwant to trust and want to build a relationship with our kids.  The  <br/>\nproblem is that our RAD kids can only tolerate a certain amount of  <br/>\nintimacy and push away relationships at all costs.  Some of our kids  <br/>\nhave moved in as young as 3, but have come from such abuse and  <br/>\nneglect that even though we&#39;ve made much progress, there are still  <br/>\nhuge attachment issues, which, as you know, result in huge trust/ <br/>\nrelationship issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe whole heartedly in unschooling.  My biological kids are 28,  <br/>\n26, &22.  I homeschooled them from the time the oldest was 1st grade  <br/>\nand we were very &quot;eclectic&quot; and &quot;relaxed&quot;.  By the time my now 22 yr  <br/>\nold was 15 we basically had dropped all curriculum and let him live.   <br/>\nI wish I&#39;d have done the same with my older two, but still, we were  <br/>\nVERY relaxed.  I really really wanted to go to complete unschooling  <br/>\nwith our other kids, but it was very frustrating.  We go back and  <br/>\nforth btw. unschooling and public school depending on the needs of  <br/>\nthe kids each year.  It seems really flakey and I hate dealing with  <br/>\nthe school and the ridiculous influences, but we kind of fly by the  <br/>\nseat of our pants.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t bore you with all the details, but our first adoptions were  <br/>\n18 years ago and we had to go into an extremely controlling type of  <br/>\nparenting because of the things you described.  They have no internal  <br/>\ncontrols and their &quot;world view&quot; is based on their earliest &quot;reality&quot;  <br/>\nwhich was extremely dysfunctional.  This is very very hard to  <br/>\novercome even after 15 years of living in a &quot;normal&quot; family who is  <br/>\nloving and gives them unconditional acceptance.  They still sabotage  <br/>\nrelationships and freedom.  They haven&#39;t developed normal boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had all been unschooling until this last year when most of them  <br/>\nwent back to public school.  Which, btw, is pathetic.  I put them  <br/>\nback into school because our 12 yr old (bio mom is a prostitute, he&#39;d  <br/>\nbeen very abused physically, was fed marijuana, alcohol etc. and  <br/>\nadopted into our fam at age 4) who had been doing really really well  <br/>\n&quot;snapped&quot; and stole a neighbors brand new truck.  He then ran away  <br/>\netc.  This caused obvious concern from the authorities.  He made  <br/>\nfalse allegations to a psychologist, admitted he lied, but some ppl  <br/>\nbelieved him...we ended up with all of our kids being interviewed by  <br/>\nsocial services etc.   It all turned out fine, but this brought our  <br/>\nfamily under intense scrutiny.   The &quot;we get to do whatever we want  <br/>\nfor school&quot; didn&#39;t fly to well with the judge & our son&#39;s attny.   <br/>\nlol!  We really needed to put our kids in school so we would have  <br/>\n&quot;witnesses&quot; that we are a &quot;normal&quot; family etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with school is that they have no sense of self so they  <br/>\nact like whoever they&#39;re with.  The older they get the more of an  <br/>\nissue this is.  They can&#39;t maintain friendships because they don&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand the give/take/loyalty that most kids naturally develop.   <br/>\nIn school they eventually end up with the &quot;wrong crowd&quot; because  <br/>\nthat&#39;s who they are accepted by.  At home they maintain a victim  <br/>\nstatus and there are usually huge power struggles over the dumbest  <br/>\nthings!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you need to realize is that you cannot change these kids.  THEY  <br/>\nhave to want to change.  We can&#39;t change their thought processes.  We  <br/>\ncan model &quot;normal&quot; but they have to decide to live that way and it&#39;s  <br/>\nusually waaaay out there for  them and very scary.  Our kids are  <br/>\ntotally different when we aren&#39;t looking.  It won&#39;t be your fault if  <br/>\neverything you have done seems to be undone.   All kids are  <br/>\ninfluenced by people and may do things that we don&#39;t approve of, but  <br/>\nour RAD kids have no loyalties to us as parents.  That&#39;s just not in  <br/>\nthem.  We live thinking that our RAD kids have changed and have  <br/>\nconnected to us.  With some, this is really true.  With others, their  <br/>\nbehavior and &quot;attachment&quot; is just a way of &quot;fitting in&quot; because &quot;in  <br/>\nthis house we have to do it this way&quot;, so it&#39;s just another survival  <br/>\nskill for them, not a life change.  With a lot of them it&#39;s not  <br/>\nreal.  It&#39;s in their &quot;heads&quot; but not in their &quot;hearts&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are working on unschooling two of the kids that are 15 & 16.  They  <br/>\nNEED to be unschooled because they NEED to develop the life skills of  <br/>\nmaking their own decisions etc.  The problem is that they take  <br/>\neverything you say as an authority challenge.  We had baby kittens  <br/>\nborn and our 16 yod brought them in the house the day they were  <br/>\nborn.  We&#39;ve raised newfoundlands & st. bernards in the past and have  <br/>\nseveral litters of barn cats over the years.  I reminded her that we  <br/>\nneed to leave the babies alone for awhile - &quot;it&#39;s best to leave them  <br/>\nalone til their eyes are open.&quot;  She brought them in 3 days later so  <br/>\nsome 3 & 5 yr olds could hold them.  I asked her if she remembered  <br/>\nthat the kittens really need to be left alone and she said, &quot;Yes, but  <br/>\nI need to make my own decisions and I don&#39;t want to do what you tell  <br/>\nme.&quot;  She&#39;s 16 and she&#39;s got a normal IQ, but her lack of attachment  <br/>\ncauses her to behave in ways that are just weird.  Today they were on  <br/>\nmy computer e-mailing and they got into my facebook and read my  <br/>\nprivate inbox...no boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, every time I post I end up writing a book.....  We only have 5  <br/>\nkids left at home and may bring them all back home again for next  <br/>\nyear.  I won&#39;t go into that but it&#39;s in my blog...<br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie<br/>\nmylifeasyomama.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not sure if (especially initially) unschooling principles would  <br/>\n&gt; work with some of these kids as they have such a different starting  <br/>\n&gt; point.

At the same time, he fought like the dickens against any kind of imposed structure - he didn&#39;t want to be told and directed. Having a regular routine helped enormously, though. I noticed when he most often needed to eat, and planned meals and snacks around those times. I noticed what sorts of things helped him deal with having high energy and planned more of those things for his high-energy times of day. I noticed that transitions were hard and actively planned gentler transitions for him. I kept the things he most often wanted in consistent locations - like shoes by the front door, cereal on a certain shelf, stuffed bunny on the pillow - so that he wouldn&#39;t be stressed out by having to search. Very very little of that involved me setting out rules or managing his time, rather it involved a lot of me *responding* to his regular needs so that they were being met not just consistently but also predictably. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;And if you have been malnourished, food regulation is sometimes an issue and needs lots of guidance, sometimes children will just eat and eat till they vomit as they are used to having no food and their bodies tell them to eat now, because it might be gone.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that all the strategies that unschoolers suggest for deschooling food are just that - strategies. The &quot;goal&quot; is for kids to be empowered where food is concerned, to feel like they are the ones making the decisions, and having a sense of abundance where food is concerned is often a key to empowerment. Depending on how old they are, bring them into the process of deciding what foods are available and coming up with plans for how to be sure everyone gets &quot;enough&quot;. For younger kids, making snacks &quot;handy&quot; - quick rather than something that needs time to prepare - can help them start to feel that sense of abundance. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] unschooling and foster children","postDate":"1273061579","msgId":43857,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUwOUYwRjJFMjY5ODQwRjlBMUIyMEIxMTdFRDVENzQ5QGRlYm9yYWg0M2YxM2ZkPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhycDFxYis2N3A1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43852,"nextInTopic":43874,"prevInTime":43856,"nextInTime":43858,"topicId":43850,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***On that more practical point in australia we don t have the legal right to not enrol foster children in school as the government is legal guardian.*** Maybe","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-818169667\">***On that more practical point in australia we don&#39;t have the legal right to not enrol foster children in school as the government is legal guardian.***<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you can find some information and ideas here: (if you haven&#39;t already seen these)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.joyouslearning.info/\">http://www.joyouslearning.info/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liberatedlearning.info/phpbb/\">http://liberatedlearning.info/phpbb/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed.vic.edu.au/\">http://www.home-ed.vic.edu.au/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hea.asn.au/\">http://hea.asn.au/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe hea site offers a lot of info and links. <br/>\n<br/>\nI found those here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/world\">http://sandradodd.com/world</a>  there is also a link to a list of Australian blogs. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] unschooling and foster children","postDate":"1273009373","msgId":43852,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhBMDg0QTU2RjVCNjQ1NzM5QzIwOUMzMURFMTgyNTM2QExZTEFMQVAyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhycDFxYis2N3A1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhycDFxYis2N3A1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43850,"nextInTopic":43857,"prevInTime":43851,"nextInTime":43853,"topicId":43850,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i just shared this article with someone this morning, about adopting older children and attachment parenting: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-357301491\">i just shared this article with someone this morning, about adopting older children and attachment parenting:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kindredcommunity.com/articles/bonding-the-journey-of-the-mother-who-adopts-older-children/p/1264\">http://www.kindredcommunity.com/articles/bonding-the-journey-of-the-mother-who-adopts-older-children/p/1264</a><br/>\nlyla<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: gemlily14 <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, May 04, 2010 4:52 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] unschooling and foster children<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n  Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Was wondering if anyone has experience unschooling foster children(or adopted children) with a history of trauma.<br/>\n  Have been parenting along lines of attachment based theories for trauma, ie Daniel Hughes, Bruce Perry and Dan Siegel.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Not sure if (especially initially) unschooling principles would work with some of these kids as they have such a different starting point.
