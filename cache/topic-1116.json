When it is time to do house work, <br/>\nwe all pitch in.  Even my 2 yr old helps right along side someone <br/>\nelse.  :)  We just all get started and bring the kids along with us <br/>\noffering them things to do along the way to help out.  It is working <br/>\ngreat and they are learning very valuable skills too.  Making it more <br/>\nlike fun instead of drudge work really make a big difference too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow to add another twist to this.  lol!<br/>\n---We also have a small farm where there is work (animal care) that <br/>\nHAS to be done.  It won&#39;t get done by itself and the animals expect <br/>\nus to keep them healthy and comfortable.  When we started farming, we <br/>\ntalked to our older kid before adding anything new to the family.  DH <br/>\nwasn&#39;t capable of doing some of the work due to an accident a few <br/>\nyears ago (he broke his right hip and thigh), so the kids knew if we <br/>\ntook on the responsability of an animal then they too would be <br/>\nresponsable for help and care.  They decided along side of us what we <br/>\nwould and wouldn&#39;t be doing.  The younger ones of course were to <br/>\nsmall at the time to be part of the decision making, but now they are <br/>\nincluded into the &quot;chore time&quot; of animal feeding-which they beg to <br/>\ndo.  lol!  They love to be around them and help care for them.  It <br/>\nhas been a wonderful experience.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis of course wouldn&#39;t not be or work if the kids were not here to <br/>\nhelp on the farm.  It requires their help/work to make it all run <br/>\nsmoothly.  Yes, dh and I could do it alone if we so desired now, but <br/>\nwe feel it is better to have the kids involved.  So, we still ask for <br/>\nthier input in matters and we all work together to make it all run <br/>\nsmoothly.  They are not forced to work, BUT they also know it is <br/>\nrequired at the same time.  We are raising foods for the whole family <br/>\nto eat-including them-and they are part of the family unit, so it is <br/>\nnecessary to for them to help with the &quot;family&quot; work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only problem we have encountered so far is our oldest dd who <br/>\nfeels her chores should only be what she should have to do.  She <br/>\nbought her own horse and she tends to skip helping with all the <br/>\nfamily animals.  This created some stress.  She has since moved out <br/>\nof the house, but WE have her horse and are having now to care for <br/>\nit.  This isn&#39;t fair, as it wasn&#39;t a decision made by us all, AND it <br/>\nis HER animal and responsability.  This is something that we as a <br/>\nfamily are going to have to take care of here in the near future and <br/>\nwill be.  But this is the only child we have had any issues with in <br/>\nthis area.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Amanda<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ren&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@n...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I have a four year old and I have required that he<br/>\n&gt; participate in working together to keep a clutter free home.
