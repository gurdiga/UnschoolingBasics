We have tons of Legos and often he&#39;s the one <br/>\ngetting them out and making amazing structures and things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that we&#39;ve gotten to really enjoy thanks to DS is the <br/>\ndrive in theater (yup there&#39;s one about 15 minutes from us!). We <br/>\nspend pretty much every Friday during the summer there (providing <br/>\nthere&#39;s at least one movie we want to see that we haven&#39;t already <br/>\nseen - they have double features and 3 screens so with 6 first run <br/>\nmovies there&#39;s usually something to go watch). We&#39;ve been there <br/>\nduring thunder storms, chilly evenings, warm muggy evenings, all <br/>\nsorts of weather. The ticket sellers and the parking guys (the ones <br/>\nwho make sure people park big vehicles in the back and small <br/>\nvehicles in the front, etc) all recognize our truck and come by to <br/>\nsay hi and all. It also led to a funny that had DS erupting <br/>\nrepeatedly in giggles last night. DH went out and picked up KFC (he <br/>\nwas wanting fried chicken without all the work). The KFC is just <br/>\npast the drive in. On the drive in sign, which he reported back to <br/>\nus, setting off the giggle fest, it said<br/>\n<br/>\nClosed for the Season. Reason.
