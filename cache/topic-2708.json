I just wanted to say that I <br/>\nwas in 4-H growing up and maybe it was just the group we were a part of, but <br/>\nit was really laid back.  Everyone participated in just what they wanted to and <br/>\ncould try out different activities and stop if they decided it wasn&#39;t fun.  <br/>\nMy family was mostly in to the animals.

There were no badges or anything like that.  It was a <br/>\ngreat way to explore many different activities and experience lots of different <br/>\nthings.  I had a great time doing it.
