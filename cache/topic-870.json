Unschooling is very organic according to<br/>\neach family, and would not be unschooling if there were a rule book.  I<br/>\ndo believe we all have wonderful things to offer to this group.  Some<br/>\nmay be more aggressively purist in their posts, and some may get their<br/>\nfeelings hurt.  We probably can all agree that as the parent, we have a<br/>\nlot to learn.  There are ways to influence people without being<br/>\nnegative, or righteous.  There are also ways to hear criticism that<br/>\nwon&#39;t leave you feeling stupid.  This is not a religion.  This is a way<br/>\nof raising our kids to be confident self-learners.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell put Andrea.  Thank you.  At times with those more &quot;purist&quot; I get the<br/>\nfeeling it is religion in the fanatical sense and was beginning to question<br/>\nwhether or not I should refer to myself as an unschooler.  In my heart and<br/>\nfrom all I have read so far it is what I am but I wondered if perhaps I<br/>\nmissed out on the rule book somewhere along the line.  I have plenty to<br/>\nlearn but trusting there is a safe place to come and pose a question or two<br/>\nor share an experience without being attacked means a lot.  There is a yahoo<br/>\ngroup for radical unschoolers.  Always Learning seems to be for the old<br/>\ntimers too but it is enjoyable nonetheless.  Basics to me means beginnings.<br/>\nMost people crawl before they walk.  It doesn&#39;t mean they have no intention<br/>\nof walking or should be judged harshly for crawling.  It simply means they<br/>\nmay be new to the path.<br/>\nKay</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":848,"nextTopicId":838}}
