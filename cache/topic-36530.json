The moment I got to &quot;ice houses&quot; my eyes glazed over and I <br/>\nwondered if there was still coffee left in the pot and did we have <br/>\n*any* coco in the house? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad I found the last part about your real day and the kids <br/>\nreading and eating apples... what a lovely snapshot, complete with <br/>\nodors, ahhhhhh. <br/>\n<br/>\nMo and I spent the afternoon hanging around in the sewing studio, <br/>\nshe on the computer playing The Incredible Machine, which has kind <br/>\nof quirky old dance music for background sound, and I trying to <br/>\ncontrive a curtain for my big round window. I&#39;m trying to applique a <br/>\nsun on one side and a moon on the other, all out of flimsy polyester <br/>\nfabrics that don&#39;t cooperate without a lot of starch. Every now and <br/>\nthen Mo would call out &quot;come see this one!&quot; and I&#39;d go look at the <br/>\nfantastice &quot;contraption&quot; she&#39;d created on the computer. They&#39;re <br/>\nsilly sorts of contraptions that include bombs and alligators and <br/>\nlots of pulleys, much fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt some point we went back to the house (the studio is in an old <br/>\nbarn) for snacks and I had one of those smell-my-kid&#39;s-hair moments. <br/>\nI often forget to do that, but I&#39;ve been spending more time on RUN <br/>\nand Sandra recommends that alot, so its on my mind. So my afternoon <br/>\nsmelled like starch and little girl and overheated polyester and <br/>\nmilky cereal and home-made spaghetti sauce and light machine oil. In <br/>\na little while my evening will probably smell of popcorn and juice <br/>\nand little girl while Mo and I watch some cartoons, snuggled <br/>\ntogether in the bed. George and Ray are off playing music so its a <br/>\ngirls night, here.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: making anything [was &quot;soap&quot;]","postDate":"1223770233","msgId":36565,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdjcmY5cCtyNzNmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDVjYWQ0NjgwODEwMTAxMjU2bzRjYTkxMTA2d2IyOWVmNmFiMGIzODgxMTZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36559,"nextInTopic":36567,"prevInTime":36564,"nextInTime":36566,"topicId":36530,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... of ...

I was thinking about how it could be a teaching moment. I could invite Linnaea or Simon to help me deal with the frosty trays in our freezer having first researched the history of Frigidaire, which is the make of fridge in my house, so that I could lecture on the history of that company. I could talk about the ice houses that I&#39;ve read about where in winter ice from a pond would be cut and stored nestled in hay in a dark and well insulated building so that there might be coolness and food storage on offer in summer.  And then how ice boxes were the fantastic way of keeping things cool for everyone, not just those folks with access to an ice house and maybe I could talk about my vague recollections of A Tree Goes in Brooklyn having an ice man bringing ice up the stairs to their apartment.  Those are interesting things, to me, this wanderings through the history and importance of keeping food<br/>\n fresh and cool. And I could talk about that and how a lot of different kinds of food preparation are about keeping something from going bad, like smoking or curing meat (although the best beef is hung for a while before it is treated, or so I am led to understand), or making cheese and yoghurt. Some of those things Simon and Linnaea may already know, some of those little bits and bobs of information may have bubbled up into their lives through me or David or one of the other many routes that they have to information. I talk a lot, David does as well. There are lots of discussions about lots of things that happen in our lives, often as they are happening. Stories that are told when cooking or watching a show or going for a walk or cuddling up in bed. And I would have talked about something if Simon or Linnaea had helped to clean out the freezer. But it wouldn&#39;t have been staged. Maybe that is the point. It would have just been a conversation with both<br/>\n sides giving and altering and moving from subject to subject without any known goal. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I finished cleaning out the freezer by myself. Linnaea went out to the new old car we bought last weekend and drove home this morning and she sat with a book on the warm black leatherette car seats with a smell that reminds me completely of my childhood and read. Simon ate an apple and watched some videos on youtube and David looked at all the rust points on the car that he wants to fix. They all learned the things that they wanted to in that moment and I enjoyed, as I always do, washing out the frosty freezer thinking thoughts and dwelling on memories of other freezers in my life. No one was sullied by my lesson plans to accompany cleaning out a freezer. And now you can open the ice drawer without using a foot for leverage (for those not familiar with the UK design of fridge, the freezer is usually on the bottom with the fridge section on the top, it isn&#39;t a big box with shelves, it&#39;s a box with drawers:<br/>\n http://www.fridgemaster.co.uk/image.asp?ProductID=141).<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nhttp://www.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to jump on the discussion for a moment, just because I <br/>\nthink something very vital is being missed.<br/>\n<br/>\nErin, no one is saying NOT to invite kids to join in on life.

I have a shortened to the point explaination (on the &quot;About Us&quot; page under FAQ&#39;s at www.kissingmoons. com) on my website on how soap is made, History of Castille soap, what is in commercial soaps and how it is different from traditional handcraftred soap, etc if you would like to use that information. &quot;<br/>\nWhatever the point of posting that  the suggestion was that you can use the making of glycerine soap as a tool for introducing ideas about hygiene, physical science, color theory and for introducing the history of castille soap and comparing the process used in making soap yourself versus the ivory soap you&#39;d buy at the store. <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid and I were just standing in the kitchen talking about why he makes soap or brews beer or fixes the car or why I knit or garden or bike. All of those things are about function. They are about getting something done. I bike to get to the store to buy milk or sherbet or frozen curly fries, or whatever, I knit because I enjoy the feel of the wool and the click of the needles and the calmness. David fixes the car because he likes to make it work better and run better and to keep it from falling apart. None of those things are done with the goal to learn something tangential to the point. That will happen. I have this fantastic book of knitted gansey patterns that talks alot about the history of the gansey and has pictures from the late 1800&#39;s of places in the UK where I&#39;ve been which is kind of cool, &#39;cause the book was a gift when I lived in Albuquerque and had no plans of living in the UK. You will also get those wonderful McGyver moments where you<br/>\n can use the knowledge you gained while fixing up the bike, or bringing soap to trace or using borax as a preservative to solve some other, seemingly unrelated, problem. But again, I don&#39;t garden to prepare myself to solve an as of yet unknown problem that I may find myself dealing with later down the road.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------snip----------<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not suggesting going into something with an educational agenda.<br/>\nRather, I&#39;m suggesting a parent invite a child to do something with<br/>\nthe parent. Just do, not necessarily learn.<br/>\n----------snip------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ll learn and not just do. It isn&#39;t possible to do and not learn, if not about the task at hand than about something else.  Try it. Try doing something, even sleeping, and not learning. You&#39;ll wake up rested, maybe, and filled with the cobwebs of dreams and thoughts and plans for the day ahead. Making soap is full of learning. But it doesn&#39;t need to be a &quot;learning opportunity&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI invite Simon and Linnaea to do stuff with me all the time, and, cooler still,  they invite me to do stuff with them. My point wasn&#39;t about inviting their company when I engage in an activity I think they might enjoy. My point was that inviting a child to join in with you with a preplanned list of teaching bullet points that the activity should achieve isn&#39;t a way to facilitate a fun time hanging out making soap. It becomes a lecture and not an engaging thing to do. The other stuff will come up, maybe. Maybe you&#39;ll be snuggling up together reading Little House on the Prarie (I seem to recall some soap making mention) and the history will be related, and the experience will already be present, or maybe it won&#39;t. Life is long and learning is always happening, maybe the possibility for knowing about material sciences and going from liquid to solid will come up again and again and again. I make a lot of ice.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------snip------------<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that a parent should say &quot;Come do this with me because<br/>\nyou might learn a thing or two.&quot; I&#39;m saying invite the kid to do<br/>\nsomething, allow him/her the opportunity to say yes or no. If yes<br/>\ngreat! Interest might be peaked, but that isn&#39;t the goal anyway. If<br/>\nnot, well, that&#39;s fine too. *shrugs*<br/>\n--------------snip------------<br/>\nBut it was implied in the post that I responded to. It was suggested that the point of making glycerine soap was to impart all the tangential knowledge that soap making may touch on. The history of soap, the comparing and contrasting of large scale soap making versus homemade soap making, the science of liquids and solids, the theory of color, the hygiene potential. <br/>\nAbsolutely, though invite your kids to do lots of things. I spend a lot of time coming up with new things to invite Simon and Linnaea to do with me. And I don&#39;t press them if they say no. And the goal is, at least in some part, to pique their interest. I want to engage them, so I offer things that I hope will do so. Things that I want to do, as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n--------------snip------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m new to this, so please don&#39;t flame me! <br/>\n<br/>\n------------snip------------<br/>\nI&#39;m not flaming you. Flaming, according to wikipedia is: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Flaming is the hostile and insulting interaction between Internet users. Flaming usually occurs in the social context of a discussion board, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) or even through e-mail. An Internet user typically generates a<br/>\nflame response to other posts or users posting on a site, and such a<br/>\nresponse is usually not constructive, does not clarify a discussion,<br/>\nand does not persuade others. Sometimes, flamers attempt to<br/>\nassert their authority or establish a position of superiority over<br/>\nother users. Other times, a flamer is simply an individual who believes<br/>\nhe or she carries the only valid opinion. This leads him or her to personally attack those who disagree. In some cases, flamers wish to upset and offend<br/>\nother members of the forum, in which case they can be called &quot;trolls.&quot; Most often however, flames are angry or insulting messages transmitted by people who have strong feelings about a subject.&quot;<br/>\nOn a discussion list like this the ideas, the words that are posted are going to be examined and discussed. I have no desire to hurt or upset you or anyone else on this list. I want to help others and be helped by others to understand and embrace unschooling. If someone comes here and talks about the educational potential of an activity there will probably be a discussion around the idea of doing something simply because of it&#39;s learning potential. However there may be very intense discussions defending the learning potential of the activities that children choose to engage in, like video games, or watching Spongebob Squarepants.  I fully believe that Simon and Linnaea would learn alot about different things making soap. What I don&#39;t believe is that I can direct and limit their learning effectively when making soap. And I think if I tried I would suffocate a lot of the joy of the activity. <br/>\n<br/>\n------------snip--------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI worry that to be a proper<br/>\nunschooler means to *not* initiate inclusion of one&#39;s child in one&#39;s<br/>\nlife. Is it ok, for example, to say to one&#39;s child, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m going to<br/>\n[place] to do [activity]. Wanna come?&quot; Or &quot;I&#39;m going to make [craft or<br/>\nfood item]. Care to join me?&quot; It worries me because I fear that if I<br/>\ndo that and then come onto an unschooling list and offer my<br/>\nexperiences having done that then I will be chastised for having done<br/>\nso. I&#39;m not trying to be mean or spiteful by asking this. Instead I<br/>\nliterally feel paralyzed from doing anything with my kids by fear of<br/>\npotentially having the wrong intention, or that it might look to an<br/>\noutsider like I had an educational agenda.<br/>\n------------snip--------------<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t want to be an unschooler if it left me feeling paralyzed about getting it right. I wouldn&#39;t want to be an unschooler if it felt like it was building walls between me engaging, playing, being with Simon and Linnaea. I don&#39;t think anyone here is chastizing anyone else for inviting their kids to join in the fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@ btopenworld. com&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I would be very wary of going into soap making with the desire to use it as<br/>\n&gt; a teaching moment.

Just do, not necessarily learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that a parent should say &quot;Come do this with me because<br/>\nyou might learn a thing or two.&quot; I&#39;m saying invite the kid to do<br/>\nsomething, allow him/her the opportunity to say yes or no. If yes<br/>\ngreat! Interest might be peaked, but that isn&#39;t the goal anyway. If<br/>\nnot, well, that&#39;s fine too. *shrugs*<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m new to this, so please don&#39;t flame me! I worry that to be a proper<br/>\nunschooler means to *not* initiate inclusion of one&#39;s child in one&#39;s<br/>\nlife. Is it ok, for example, to say to one&#39;s child, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m going to<br/>\n[place] to do [activity]. Wanna come?&quot; Or &quot;I&#39;m going to make [craft or<br/>\nfood item]. Care to join me?&quot; It worries me because I fear that if I<br/>\ndo that and then come onto an unschooling list and offer my<br/>\nexperiences having done that then I will be chastised for having done<br/>\nso. I&#39;m not trying to be mean or spiteful by asking this.
