This is my mantra and you should learn it:<br/>\nThe only person you are accountable to for your child&#39;s learning is<br/>\nyour child.  And if you choose to unschool and allow her the freedom<br/>\nto learn as she chooses then that&#39;s all that matters.  Most of my<br/>\nfriends know we unschool (and some of those do as well!)  My family<br/>\nwould never understand unschooling because they would never take the<br/>\ntime to read up on it.  With my extended family I don&#39;t even discuss<br/>\nanything with them. With my mom I just tell her to trust me.  It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stop her from offering advice and hoping that I will take her<br/>\nup on her offer to help get the kids into the &quot;right programs&quot;  but it<br/>\nreally isn&#39;t anyone&#39;s business!
