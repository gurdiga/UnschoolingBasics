That pretty much sums up my life. I did all the things I was supposed to do, but today I can&#39;t figure out what I&#39;m doing here. My only real passion after finishing college was having a family. I&#39;ve loved birthing nursing and carrying my babies all over the place. Now that I&#39;ve &quot;awakened&quot; to life beyond what &quot;they&quot; (society, religion, school)tell me to do, I&#39;m not sure what do with my kids, let alone myself. Thank you again for your words.
