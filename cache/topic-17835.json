The author uses William Howell&#39;s<br/>\nmodel of the Four Stages of Competency applied to parenting:<br/>\n<br/>\nStage 1:<br/>\nUnconscious Incompetency.<br/>\nI react automatically w/ no consideration for long-term consequences.

The tools and<br/>\ninsight Ms. Harris provided are already proving beneficial.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a mom to and 18 and 15 year old using traditional parenting styles I<br/>\nswung from one extreme to the other when my 2 year old came along.  From<br/>\nwanting total submission to authority to feeling like I had to keep the kids<br/>\nhappy all the time.  ~At my expense!<br/>\nI&#39;m realizing that boundaries are healthy.  There is a happy medium and I<br/>\nWILL eventually see it.  I have the right to feel as I do......be it anger<br/>\nor joy.....(just as my kids do)......however *I* am responsible for my<br/>\nfeelings.  My rage does not really come from being yelled at by my 2 year<br/>\nold or because my 18 year old still throws her clothes in the floor instead<br/>\nof the laundry area.  By changing my perception I can see that *I* need to<br/>\ntake responsibility for my own anger and not blame it on anyone else.  It&#39;s<br/>\na habit I fell into many years ago.  If I can blame someone else for my<br/>\nissues with statements such as .......&quot;You are really pissing me<br/>\noff&quot;........instead of owning them......&quot;this makes me angry because I<br/>\nfeel......&quot;.......then I don&#39;t have to open old wounds and examine what<br/>\nabout the situation pisses me off.  In other words I can change the blame to<br/>\nself exploration, let the wounds dry up, and move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dear mama friends,  please get yourself a copy of this book!<br/>\nI&#39;m sure it will be a blessing and a relief!<br/>\nLove to all,<br/>\nNay<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/dazynay\">http://360.yahoo.com/dazynay</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFacing a mirror you see merely your own countenance; facing your child you<br/>\nfinally understand how everyone else has seen you.<br/>\n~Daniel Raeburn, The New Yorker, 05-01-2006<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17821,"nextTopicId":17833}}
