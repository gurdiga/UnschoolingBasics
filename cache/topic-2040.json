I always answer, of course they&#39;ll be holes in <br/>\nhis education, but no, I&#39;m not afraid of missing anything important.  <br/>\nOn the surface this answer seems contradictory, but on closer <br/>\nexamination it makes perfect sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course they&#39;ll be holes in his education.  We all haves holes in <br/>\nour education.  There is so much to do, see, and learn in this world, <br/>\nthere is no way anyone can learn it all.  There is no way any school <br/>\ncan even come close to teaching it all.  How many people graduate <br/>\nhigh school knowing nothing about chemistry or world politics?  How <br/>\nmany people graduate college knowing nothing about art or religion?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a PhD in biology.  I spent 23 years of my life in school.  23 <br/>\nyears!  I have huge holes in my knowledge.  Although I&#39;m a scientist <br/>\nI know very little about physics.  I knew even less geology and <br/>\nalmost no astronomy.  I&#39;m learning more astronomy now because my <br/>\nhusband is really interested in it.  My holes in other subjects are <br/>\neven larger.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son wants to build a real combat robot like those seen in <br/>\nBattlebots.  I know nothing about this.  I have no idea how the <br/>\nmechanics work, how the motors and gears go together to make motion.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t know how the electronics are hooked up to bring power to all <br/>\nthe components.  Programming a remote is beyond me.  Even the metal <br/>\nworking, the seemingly simplest part leaves me at a loss.  The good <br/>\nnews is I can learn all these things.  I am learning all these <br/>\nthings.  I can fill this hole.  However, I will always have holes.  <br/>\nSo will my son.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I&#39;m not afraid of missing anything important.  What&#39;s important <br/>\nto learn is different for each person.  What&#39;s important for an <br/>\nartist to know will be totally different than what&#39;s important for a <br/>\nmathematician to know.  I can&#39;t know what will be important to my <br/>\nson, a school certainly can&#39;t know what will be important to him, <br/>\nonly he can know that.  What I do know is that if it is important he <br/>\nwill learn it.  He may not learn it by the time he is 10 or 15 or <br/>\neven 18, but learning doesn&#39;t stop at these ages.  Learning happens <br/>\nour entire life.  If it is important to know when he is 40, he can <br/>\nlearn it then.  There is no deadline on learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will definitely be holes in my son&#39;s education, but I&#39;m not <br/>\nworried about missing anything important.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":107504422,"authorName":"jesika hare","from":"jesika hare &lt;jesika2starr@...&gt;","profile":"jesika2starr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] help me understand","postDate":"1089921696","msgId":2103,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzE1MjAwMTM2LjgxMzQ1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzOTA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJEMUI1M0FGLjI5MTZDJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":2101,"nextInTopic":2104,"prevInTime":2102,"nextInTime":2104,"topicId":2040,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"thanks to everyone for helping me with this...!! just to add, i *do* know kids, some homeschooled, some not, but none that are unschooled. so, i was just","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-81035282\">thanks to everyone for helping me with this...!! just<br/>\nto add, i *do* know kids, some homeschooled, some not,<br/>\nbut none that are unschooled. so, i was just wondering<br/>\nabout the differnce in them .... <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; on 7/14/04 5:44 PM, jesika hare at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jesika2starr@...\">jesika2starr@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; but i<br/>\n&gt; &gt; am wondering how your children learn  much when<br/>\n&gt; its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just left up to them?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why would kids *not* learn when it&#39;s left up to<br/>\n&gt; them?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Actually you can&#39;t answer that question because you<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know any kids. ;-)<br/>\n&gt; You only know *schooled* kids.

He asked for and received electric guitar lessons <br/>\nfor his birthday.  Mondays he goes to a nearby school and takes <br/>\nAfrican drumming lessons. He&#39;s taking a weekly film class starting in <br/>\nMarch, and we&#39;ll be sending him to a weeklong film school in Maine in <br/>\nMay. Duncan (almost 8) just started karate lessons.  Ben (my husband) <br/>\nhas just finished a class (with tests and all) that&#39;s required before <br/>\nhe can put on Lt Col (Air National Guard) and is now in NJ for three <br/>\nweeks of &quot;rah-rah&quot; and classroom training and tests for the two new <br/>\ndrugs he will be selling. I&#39;m going to a one-day intensive &quot;Bee <br/>\nSchool&quot; to learn to take care of my Christmas present: two beehives.<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron said the other day, &quot;For Unschoolers, we sure are taking a <br/>\nlot of schooly classes!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat got me thinking...especially since we are one of those families <br/>\nthat discovered unschooling after years and years of schooling. I <br/>\nthink that there are three &quot;Stages of Unschooling&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nStage I<br/>\nThe first stage is the longest and most difficult and involves <br/>\ngetting rid of all school-think, which includes classes <br/>\nand &quot;instruction&quot; and school-speak. We have to rid ourselves of the <br/>\nreliance on schools and teachers and testing and book-worship. We <br/>\nneed to look deeply into the difference between &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;learn&quot;. <br/>\nWe ban classes and structure and nagging. It&#39;s accepting that grades <br/>\nand requirements and diplomas and curricula and extrinsic motivations <br/>\ntruly have no meaning in an unschooling life. It&#39;s realizing that the <br/>\nwhole world is related and inter-related: it&#39;s about NOT dividing the <br/>\nworld into subjects: math is science is art is history is literature <br/>\nis FUN! It&#39;s a time for reflection on how we&#39;ve learned the things <br/>\nthat really matter in our adult lives.  It&#39;s hard to let go of all <br/>\nthat school-think, to go beyond what we&#39;ve been *taught* was <br/>\nimportant and to value ALL learning as important. It&#39;s realizing that <br/>\nwe learn what WE believe is important WHEN we are ready.  And it&#39;s <br/>\nrealizing that what&#39;s important often changes. It&#39;s about abolishing <br/>\ncoercion in learning and about the freedom to change passions. It&#39;s <br/>\nunderstanding that learning doesn&#39;t stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n Face it, almost all of you reading this in 2004 went to school---at <br/>\nleast for 12 years, maybe as many as 22 or 25 years! School is so <br/>\ningrained in us, that it&#39;s hard to think any other way. We <br/>\nappreciate &quot;straight A students&quot; and &quot;AP&quot; classes and college prep <br/>\nhigh schools and term papers and &quot;higher math&quot; and high SAT/ACT <br/>\nscores. &quot;Good&quot; students are given preferential treatment by everyone: <br/>\npizzas for reading and Chuck E. Cheese tokens for good report cards. <br/>\nEven our child&#39;s car insurance is lowered if we have an &quot;A student&quot;!<br/>\n<br/>\n Stage one is about ridding our minds of those things, about really <br/>\nthinking about learning in a holistic manner. It&#39;s about examining <br/>\nhow we learned what truly interests us---especially those things that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t require a &quot;teacher&quot;. What are your passions? HOW did you learn <br/>\nto do those things? In a classroom?<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo of my passions as a child were dogs and horses. Dogs and horses <br/>\nare NOT taught in any grade, middle, or high school *I* know of. But <br/>\nI wanted to learn everything I could about them. My parents gave me <br/>\ndogs and horses. They bought me books and paid for me to take riding <br/>\nlessons and dog obedience classes. They paid for dog and horse shows <br/>\nand equipment. My passion threw me into reading every book I could <br/>\nfind (there were no videos back then----or &quot;Animal Planet&quot;!). By <br/>\ntwelve I could identify every breed of dog and horse that I had ever <br/>\nseen or read about and tell you how it was developed, where, why, and <br/>\nby whom. I spent every weekend and every afternoon at a dog <br/>\nshow/horse show/event/trial or just hanging around the stable or <br/>\nkennel. I asked thousands of question and &quot;got my hands dirty&quot;. Many <br/>\nof my friends were adults with the same passions. Training, breeding, <br/>\ngrooming, showing, husbandry----all of these things I learned because <br/>\nI was consumed by them!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, of course, dogs and horses are NOT school subjects---and are <br/>\ncompletely unimportant in the school world. What if I had waited for <br/>\na teacher to come along and say, &quot;Today we are learning all about dog <br/>\nand horses&quot;? Not only would I have waited all my life, the teacher <br/>\nwould only have given me a &quot;taste&quot; of the subject!<br/>\n<br/>\n OH! And you *can&#39;t* make a living with dogs and horses---right? &#61514;<br/>\n<br/>\nStage one is often referred to as DEschooling. It&#39;s the period of <br/>\ntime we need to give ourselves in order to &quot;step away from the box&quot; <br/>\nof school and school-think. Ask yourself why and how you learned your <br/>\npassion: whether it was music, cooking, flying, gardening, or long-<br/>\ndistance running. Or even more &quot;academic-like&quot; passions, like <br/>\nShakespeare, chemistry, World War II, or a foreign language. When you <br/>\nare comfortable with how learning happens by indulging in passions <br/>\nand making connections in your learning, you are quickly heading <br/>\ntowards stage two.<br/>\n<br/>\nStage II<br/>\nOnce you are comfortable with the idea of immersion learning----and <br/>\nyou&#39;re over wanting or needing classes and structure, you&#39;re finally <br/>\nover the deschooling hump and are actively in the process of <br/>\nUNschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n Stage two involves really immersing ourselves----and allowing our <br/>\nchildren to immerse themselves---into passions and even into slight, <br/>\nfleeting interests.  Seeing connections and making connections and <br/>\nyet realizing that somethings *might* not connect for YEARS is the <br/>\nmost important part of stage two.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnection: I remember lying in my bed when I was about 11 or 12. My <br/>\nbed was behind the door, so that, when open, the door obscured the <br/>\nhead of my bed. I had tied a string to my doorknob. I would try to <br/>\nshut my door with my finger at the point of the doorjamb; then I <br/>\nwould open the door back up with a pull on the string. It took *a <br/>\nlot* of pressure (and pain!) to close my door at the point of the <br/>\njamb. But every inch closer to the door knob I got, it would be <br/>\neasier and easier to close, so that by the time I was right at the <br/>\nedge of the door (by the knob), I could almost &quot;blow&quot; it shut. I <br/>\nhad &quot;discovered&quot; torque----but it had no name!<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool&#39;s idea that children should be given the definition of torque <br/>\nand then have it explained is backwards. It was so simple for me to <br/>\nunderstand the definition of torque because I already had made the <br/>\npersonal and meaningful connection with my bedroom door.<br/>\n<br/>\nPassion: There are people who invest their time (and many even make a <br/>\nliving) studying Elizabethan fashion or reading/writing about the <br/>\nworks of John Steinbeck or determining whether an 17th century chair <br/>\nis a forgery or watching birds make nests/feed their young or , as I <br/>\nheard on the radio yesterday: there&#39;s this guy who&#39;s getting his <br/>\nMasters degree in Soil Science! Go figure!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf allowed (and often, even if not allowed!), a child will pursue his <br/>\ncareer by following his passion(s). A wise parent will encourage this <br/>\npursuit of passion, because it may be what the child decides to <br/>\ndevote his life&#39;s work to. Maybe *more* importantly, that wise parent <br/>\nwill step aside when a passion becomes &quot;old&quot; because the parent will <br/>\nknow that *some* connection has been made with this fleeting passion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom 10-12 years old, Cameron was a magician. I actually thought that <br/>\nhe would become the next Lance Burton or Jeff McBride (who once <br/>\nreferred to Cameron as &quot;mini-me&quot;!). He was so passionate about magic, <br/>\nhe would practice and perform ALL day! Insert here: &quot;If I let him, <br/>\nCameron would sit around and do magic ALL DAY!&quot; Well, he DID! Until <br/>\nthe day when he quit. I was stunned! He&#39;d lost all interest. We&#39;d put <br/>\nthousands of dollars into costumes and tricks and gimmicks and <br/>\nconventions and tapes and books and private sessions with famous <br/>\nmagicians---and he just up and quit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first I was incredulous. Then I realized it was just an intense, <br/>\nfleeting passion. We still have a huge box of magic upstairs in the <br/>\nattic. He can come back to it whenever----or not. What&#39;s important is <br/>\nthat it inspired him and fed a passion and entertained him (and us <br/>\nand hundreds more). He met some truly fascinating people and made <br/>\nconnections that will last a lifetime---because he had an interest, a <br/>\npassion.<br/>\n<br/>\nStage one, deschooling, is a very uncomfortable time! It&#39;s a period <br/>\nof intense questioning and of challenging yourself to think <br/>\ndifferently. This is difficult, but it can be done---as with all <br/>\nlearning: when you&#39;re ready to!<br/>\n<br/>\nStage two may be even more uncomfortable, because you&#39;re actually <br/>\nputting the ideas into action: you&#39;re allowing the passions to take <br/>\nover and you&#39;re not pushing the three &quot;R&#39;s&quot;. You are beginning to <br/>\ntrust that the child will learn and you&#39;re respecting his choices. <br/>\nYou&#39;re UNschooling! And the more you do it, the easier it gets!<br/>\n<br/>\nStage three is freedom and joy and trust and respect and desire: <br/>\nRadical Unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n Stage III<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third and final stage is when we can honestly and sincerely look <br/>\nat ALL learning as equal and not hold one &quot;method&quot; or style or <br/>\nsubject or means of obtaining information above another. By stage <br/>\nthree, we live and breathe unschooling---it&#39;s such a part of our day-<br/>\nto-day living that we can&#39;t separate it from our lives: it&#39;s not just <br/>\nthe &quot;educational&quot; part because *everything* is educational. We can <br/>\napply unschooling principles to bedtimes and eating and video gaming <br/>\nand TV and &quot;chores&quot;. We know that our children will learn because <br/>\nit&#39;s what they were born to do; they&#39;re hard-wired to learn. Learning <br/>\nis how the human species survives and progresses and<br/>\nsucceeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the stage when we can effectively and confidently start <br/>\ngiving out unschooling information to the uninformed or misinformed <br/>\nbecause we &quot;get it.&quot; We can live our lives joyfully because we&#39;re not <br/>\nworried whether Susie will pass her algebra or whether Johnny will be <br/>\nable to get into a good college, because they WILL if they want to. <br/>\nWe know that they will pursue their passions...well, passionately! <br/>\nAnd that each day will bring more connections and learning <br/>\nopportunities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the stage when classes and instruction may eke back into our <br/>\nlives, as it recently has in our family&#39;s. We don&#39;t give more weight <br/>\nto the learning that is happening in Sociology-101 or karate or bee-<br/>\nkeeping just because it&#39;s happening in a classroom situation. A class <br/>\nis just another means of pursuing our passions, making the <br/>\nconnections, and receiving the information. Learning happens all the <br/>\ntime in all places---*even* in a classroom!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to give the impression that acceptance of class/book <br/>\nlearning automatically makes you a Radical Unschooler. Stage III <br/>\ncannot &quot;just happen&quot;: you&#39;ll have to go through Stages I and II <br/>\nfirst. For those of us that attended school, deschooling will always <br/>\nexist at a lower level throughout our lives. The next generation (our <br/>\nunschooled children) will not have this stage to work through: <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be able to see all learning as equal and good from the get-go.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a process: getting rid of the school-think and structure, <br/>\nbecoming comfortable and implementing immersion learning, and *then* <br/>\naccepting ALL learning as equally valuable.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] help me understand","postDate":"1089854319","msgId":2072,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEMUI1M0FGLjI5MTZDJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzE0MjE0NDA3LjQ3MjYyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzOTA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2071,"nextInTopic":2073,"prevInTime":2071,"nextInTime":2073,"topicId":2040,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

No schedule. No time limit or  <br/>\nmaximum/minimum age for learning something.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy children are surrounded by dogs. They learn about dogs because they  <br/>\nobserve dogs, because they ask questions about dogs, because I talk about dogs.  <br/>\nThey go to dog training classes. They do to dog shows. They watch me work with  <br/>\nthe dogs. They play with the dogs. We groom dogs. They can&#39;t help but learn  <br/>\nabout dogs.

Our children live full<br/>\ninteresting lives pursuing interests that are of vital importance *to them*<br/>\nand their interior selves. In the course of this, real life skills such as<br/>\nmath use or spelling (well enough that the meaning gets across) get learnt.<br/>\nChildren ask for the help they need unless they have learnt that asking for<br/>\nhelp gets them some kind of lesson with the parent&#39;s agenda foremost. <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren who seem unmotivated are often damaged by school. Alternatively<br/>\nthey are plenty motivated, but don&#39;t get unconditional support from their<br/>\nparents in those interests, so keep them secret. Some have to struggle with<br/>\nfeelings of lack of self-worth from constantly having their interests<br/>\nbelittled in favor of &quot;important&quot; schoolish subjects. 12 years old is a long<br/>\nway from your baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to save your imagination, you can come to the conference and see<br/>\nwith your own eyes a couple of hundred enthusiastic autodidacts of all ages.<br/>\nOr you can keep reading and take our word for it that the kids are full of<br/>\ndiverse consuming passions.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;i am very interested in raising my 10m<br/>\nold by unschooling, but I&#39;m afraid he will need some<br/>\nstructured lessons.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe may not, or he may want them. The key is following his lead, and leaving<br/>\nhim free to stop the structured lessons on his timetable. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou may find Unschooling easier if you try to keep the mindset of enjoying<br/>\nthe present moment, and not getting caught up in future scenario that is at<br/>\nleast several years away.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;i&#39;m sorry , but i just don&#39;t see<br/>\nkids &quot;wanting&quot; to learn things. i understand that they<br/>\nlearn thru life experiences, but they don&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily learn every thing they might need.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough life experiences and self-motivation is the only authentic way to<br/>\nlearn everything that a person genuinely needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you spend some time observing your son, you will see that &quot;wanting&quot; to<br/>\nlearn about his expanding world is his primary motivation for all his<br/>\nactions. Forced lessons is the number one inhibitor and destroyer of that<br/>\ninstinct.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; how do<br/>\nyou get a child to want to learn instead of play video<br/>\ngames, etc?.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t.<br/>\nWe don&#39;t see those as mutually exclusive. <br/>\n<br/>\nTry www.sandradodd.com and click on the gaming links.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I didn&#39;t learn how to balance a checking account, manage a <br/>\nhome, cook, clean, have a healthy pregnancy and birth, raise children, <br/>\nknit, garden, auto maintantence, taking care of dogs and horses, buying <br/>\na home, getting a job, using a computer, using the Internet, canning <br/>\nfood, herbalism, nutrition, and how to swim until AFTER I graduated <br/>\nfrom high school.  That short list is just what I came up with off the <br/>\ntop of my head in about one minute.  There&#39;s tons more, but I won&#39;t <br/>\nbore the list.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI learn new things every day and &quot;big&quot; things on a regular basis.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s always MORE to learn.  There&#39;s no way that you could ever learn <br/>\nEVERY thing you MIGHT need all by the time you&#39;re 18.  Besides, most of <br/>\nthe things that I now deem &quot;important&quot;.... I didn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass <br/>\nabout when I was a child or teen.  LOL  Those things will come with <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [how do you get a child to want to learn instead of play video games, <br/>\n&gt; etc?]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t try?  :)  Seriously, there&#39;s nothing &quot;bad&quot; about playing video <br/>\ngames.  Your DS is likely reading, using math, strategy, memorizing <br/>\nfacts and trivia, hand/eye coordination, and more.  Here&#39;s a link to a <br/>\ncouple of issues including TV, video games and the like.  I also <br/>\n*really* encourage you to read through as much of Sandra&#39;s web site as <br/>\nyou can.  This helped me immensely while I was on my journey of <br/>\nlearning (GASP!  There I was going and learning again! ;&#39;) about an <br/>\nunschooling lifestyle.   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/life\">http://sandradodd.com/life</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHTH  :D<br/>\n-Tracy-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":72521049,"authorName":"Wendy E","from":"&quot;Wendy E&quot; &lt;mommytoluc@...&gt;","profile":"mommytoluc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Food","postDate":"1089846424","msgId":2052,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNkNGVhbytocTA5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2051,"nextInTopic":2053,"prevInTime":2051,"nextInTime":2053,"topicId":2040,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes, Trader Joes rules!

I would be happy to offer you ideas, just not sure where to start.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son (3.5) is into bean burritos with tomatos and onions, macaroni and spinach with extra cheese, pizzas with boca crumbles brocoli and tomatos...falafel, anything dipped in hummus (easy to make).<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go all day...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy baby (1) loves guacamole with cottage cheese cheddar.  Smoothies are a huge hit around here and raw pasta sauce (tomatos, garlic in blender).  I make most of my dishes kid friendly by adding cheese or some tomato based sauce...put ANYTHING in a sandwich maker with WW bread and cheese, dip in sauce.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried to be vegan for a little bit but we just can&#39;t stay away from cows cheese!<br/>\n HTH<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Wendy E <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, July 14, 2004 1:34 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Food<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Any ideas for quick, easy, vegetarian, kid friendly foods? <br/>\n  Cookbooks...etc....<br/>\n<br/>\n  searching for ideas... <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
