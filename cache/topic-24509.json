I wouldn&#39;t have told the kids it would be. I would have said we&#39;ll look at it as that date got nearer and see what it looked like and then check it out on 6/16 if it looked likely. But if I thought it was safe and we were there already, I would have stayed with the kids and DH while they played. What could the big bad park authorities do, anyway?

Their was <br/>\na sign up that said it would be closed till 6/15. So, for the past <br/>\nmonth and a half we have been telling my daughter that the park would <br/>\nbe open on 6/16. So on Saturday (6/16) we went to go play at it but <br/>\nthe park was nowhere near finished.
