It&#39;s old, with last year&#39;s conference info. I had to update a few  <br/>\nthings---new e-lists and websites and such. <br/>\n <br/>\nPam, I need to get your math site info to be included! <br/>\n <br/>\nFunny thing is: Ren names this new list UnschoolingBasics, and I&#39;d  <br/>\nforgettien that was this one&#39;s name! Maybe I should rename it &quot;Unschooling-101&quot;!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooling Basics<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is trusting the  child to learn what he needs to learn when he<br/>\nneeds to learn it. Unschooling  is also sometimes called &quot;natural learning&quot; <br/>\nand<br/>\n&quot;child-led learning&quot; . But  mostly unschooling is NOT school-at home: we do <br/>\nnot<br/>\ntry to replicate school  in our houses. It&#39;s real living in the real<br/>\nworld---for and with a purpose.  You cannot live and not learn---we&#39;re <br/>\nsurrounded by real opportunities every day  to learn. And it&#39;s REAL learning, not <br/>\nsimulated as in<br/>\nschool. Living is  learning is unschooling is living is learning  is<br/>\nunschooling.....<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several good books on the inanity and  insanity of schools and on<br/>\nthe marvels of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling  &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer in the<br/>\n70&#39;s who came to  realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most popular<br/>\nbooks are How  Children Fail, How Children Learn, Teach Your Own, and Learning<br/>\nAll the  Time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year.  He finally<br/>\nquit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely  behind<br/>\nunschooling. His two big books are Dumbing Us Down and The Underground  <br/>\nHistory<br/>\nof American Education.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank Smith has a great little book  called The Book of Learning and<br/>\nForgetting that shows how little one learns  in and remembers from school. He<br/>\npushes REAL learning---for a  purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards shows the total inanity of  EXtrinsic<br/>\nmotivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of  INtrinsic<br/>\nmotivation.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrace Llewellyn&#39;s The Teenage Liberation  Handbook (How to Quit School and<br/>\nGet a REAL Education) is the &quot;bible&quot; for  unschoolers. It&#39;s a great read for<br/>\nteens, but parents should read it too. Be  SURE not to skip the &quot;cute little<br/>\nstory&quot; at the beginning. Grace also hosts  the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; in <br/>\nthe early<br/>\nfall for teen unschoolers---a  place to meet other unschoolers and share<br/>\npassions and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary  Griffith has two books, The Homeschooling Handbook and The  Unschooling<br/>\nHandbook. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for  documenting<br/>\nwhat&#39;s being learned; and, since that is a requirement in SC,  it&#39;s very <br/>\nhelpful.<br/>\nBut The Unschooling Handbook is THE handbook for new  unschoolers. In it she<br/>\ngives real life examples and explanations. VERY  understandable. Convinced my<br/>\nhusband that what I was suggesting made sense!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert has two: And the Skylark Sings with Me and  Homeschooling and the<br/>\nVoyage of Self-Discovery. Both are witty---and easy  reads.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie Fitzenreiter has a brand new book that I highly recommend:  The<br/>\nUnprocessed Child: Living Without School. It&#39;s about unschooling her  <br/>\ndaughter,<br/>\nLaurie. I give it as gifts a LOT!<br/>\n <br/>\nMagazines:<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Life Learning Magazine&quot; <br/>\n&quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;, originally  put out by John Holt. No longer in <br/>\nproduction, but back issues available from  &quot;old&quot; unschoolers and from FUNbooks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWebsites:<br/>\n<br/>\n_www.unschooling.com_ (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/)\">http://www.unschooling.com/)</a>  is THE website  for <br/>\nunschooling. There are other lists<br/>\nthat &quot;say&quot; they unschool; these are  the radicals who KNOW what they are <br/>\ntalking<br/>\nabout. There are essays and FAQs  which you should definitely read first.<br/>\nAfterwards go to the message boards  and read, read, READ! If you have <br/>\nquestions<br/>\nafter reading for a few weeks,  then post---but most things have been <br/>\nexplained<br/>\nbefore, so if you read,  you&#39;ll run across the answers to most of your<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe posters to pay attention to are Sandra Dodd,  Joyce Fetteroll, Pam<br/>\nSorooshian, Anne Ohman, Lyle, and Mary Gold. There  are other wonderful <br/>\nposters, but<br/>\nthese are all radical unschoolers who all  have great ways of expressing <br/>\nthemselves and getting to the nitty gritty of  unschooling. They will all be at the<br/>\nconference in August.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">_UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>_ <br/>\n(mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>)  is  a great e-list if you prefer your messages in mail form, but <br/>\nthe traffic is  HIGH. 200-400/day sometimes on the Discussion list.

It hosts<br/>\nthe unschooling conference in  August.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd is a radical unschooler of three children, 16, 14,  & 12 (I<br/>\nthink). She has her own website that is chocked FULL of essays  and stories <br/>\nabout<br/>\nunschooling.

Meet other families on the same journey,<br/>\nlisten to inspiring speakers, and  discover the art of unschooling in <br/>\nbeautiful<br/>\ndowntown Columbia, SC. This is a  non-age-discriminatory conference: anyone <br/>\ncan<br/>\nparticipate in any Funshop or  Presentation. Bring the whole family for a<br/>\njoy-filled  weekend!<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool&#39;s Out Support (SOS) is a volunteer-driven, statewide  organization<br/>\nwhose mission is to support and promote unschooling, provide  information,<br/>\nmonitor and influence legislation, offer opportunities for  families to get <br/>\ntogether,<br/>\nand empower families to make the choices that  respect the rights, needs and<br/>\naspirations of their children. SOS welcomes  anyone with an interest in<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince its inception in April  2001, SOS has supported families that have made<br/>\nthe decision to unschool as  they face difficult questions and challenges.<br/>\nThese families may wonder about  socialization, the legal issues surrounding<br/>\nunschooling, accountability  associations, or integration of John Holt&#39;s<br/>\neducational philosophy into their  everyday lives. Some families may doubt <br/>\ntheir abilities, feel confused and ask  themselves, &quot;Can I really do this?&quot;. SOS <br/>\nencourages<br/>\nparents to trust  themselves and their children to make good decisions and<br/>\nempowers them to  find the support and information they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur Presenters<br/>\nFor our  Keynote presenter we are very fortunate to have the popular<br/>\ncontributor to  Unschooling.com message boards, its e-list, AlwaysLearning, <br/>\nand<br/>\nregular  columnist in HEM---unschooling guru, Sandra Dodd. A former middle  <br/>\nschool<br/>\nteacher, Sandra has talked countless families into running away from  school <br/>\nand<br/>\njumping into learning for fun. Her motto: &quot;Everything  Counts!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re also delighted to have Anne Ohman, from the  Unschooling.com message<br/>\nboards, back for a return engagement. She &quot;stole the  show&quot; last year with her<br/>\ndebut and is now in demand at conferences all over  the country. AnneO&#39;s<br/>\npassionate, gentle approach to life and learning  continues to inspire <br/>\nfamilies<br/>\ndaily.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian is well known in  &quot;all the unschooling<br/>\ncircles&quot;---Unschooling.com&#39;s message boards, the  unschoolingdotcom e-list,<br/>\nAlwaysLearning, NHEN, and<br/>\nthe California boards.  When she&#39;s not teaching college level economics and<br/>\nstatistics, Pam&#39;s an  unschooling mom of three teenagers: she&#39;s &quot;been there, <br/>\ndone<br/>\n<br/>\nthat&quot;---and  will surely have a few answers for you!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Gold is better known as  &quot;Zenmomma&quot;--and you can find her wherever<br/>\nunschooling is a topic! Mary  &quot;preaches&quot; peace and trust and joy---and the <br/>\npure<br/>\ndelight of unschooling her  children. Her encouraging words are music to a<br/>\nstressed<br/>\nparent&#39;s  ears---and she always leaves you knowing that &quot;Life is good!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Weiss&#39;  storytelling has captivated and delighted both adults and children<br/>\nwith his  original stories and retellings of classics.
