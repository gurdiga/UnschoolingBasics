The reason I rejected the posts<br/>\nwas not to avoid a discussion on various educational philosophies and<br/>\nthe merits or demerits of each, but because I feel it is disrespectful<br/>\nto the list members that joine here to learn about UNSCHOOLING.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to further this conversation, I am posting a small part of one<br/>\npost that I rejected. I figured it will foster a discussion without<br/>\nthe list feeling &quot;preached at&quot; about how great Montessori is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy issues with the following post are:  Unschoolers are quite aware of<br/>\na child&#39;s need to be involved in real work and invited into the adult<br/>\nworld. If the poster had read here for more than a week, that much<br/>\nwould be obvious.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, how does Montessori meet these needs better than<br/>\nunschooling??  The truth is, it doesn&#39;t.

Kids not only love to play, but they love<br/>\nto work and do what they see adults doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids love to stretch themselves and do hard things (as long as they<br/>\nchoose it themselves) and to do it themselves.   They are pulled by<br/>\ntheir own interest like a magnet into such activities and they get<br/>\ntremendous satisfaction out of doing these things.    The<br/>\nMontessori environment is a response to the children&#39;s desire in<br/>\nthis direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, Montessori does not close the door to play, fantasy, art,<br/>\nmusic, dance, poetry, love of<br/>\nnature, etc., but these are all an integral part of Montessori as<br/>\nwell.
