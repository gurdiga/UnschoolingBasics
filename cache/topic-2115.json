Tori is thrilled that people are wishing her <br/>\nwell when they don&#39;t even know her.  She&#39;s doing great, now if I can <br/>\njust keep her from reinjuring herself until she heals.  Today she <br/>\nwanted to take the dog for a walk and I had to remind her how hard <br/>\nhe pulls on the leash. Kids bounce back amazingly fast.  I on the <br/>\nother hand, feel like I got hit by a truck.  It was all very scary <br/>\nand we won&#39;t even go into the looks we got when I told them she <br/>\nhadn&#39;t had a tetanus shot and needed one....or when Tori announced <br/>\nto the Dr that she didn&#39;t do schoolwork when asked if she was <br/>\nlooking forward to school starting.  She did give all of them the <br/>\nthird degree before she&#39;d let them do anything to her.  I have to <br/>\ngive them credit for answering all of her questions and respecting <br/>\nher right to ask. They even went out of their way to find <br/>\nalternatives when she didn&#39;t want shots to numb her arm for <br/>\nstitching and when she finally told them she&#39;d take the shots after <br/>\nabout 30 stitches, they didn&#39;t bat an eye. She was very brave,  <br/>\n(unlike her mom) and somehow missed damaging any major arteries and <br/>\nnerves.  Now if we can get through the next couple of weeks without <br/>\nher trying to run on all fours I think she will heal just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore info than you needed but did want to thank you all for thinking <br/>\nabout us. <br/>\n<br/>\nLeaAnn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Wow...what a scary thing to have happen.
