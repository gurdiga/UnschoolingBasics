My son, Kevin, has some of <br/>\nthe best spelling and grammar and he has never had a formal lesson.  <br/>\nHe knows when a sentence sounds right and when it doesn&#39;t.  He used to <br/>\nbe a big reader of books but now most of his reading is on the <br/>\ncomputer, for which he spends hours a day on!  With his spelling, he <br/>\nknows I am always available and quite often (used to be dozens of <br/>\ntimes a day, now just a few times a day) just calls out and asks me <br/>\nhow things are spelled.   I tell him the answer, he types it, and he <br/>\nis on with whatever he is doing.  Most people don&#39;t know all the <br/>\njargon of grammar but we know how things are supposed to sound in a <br/>\nsentence, that is what is really important.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9912,"nextTopicId":9901}}
