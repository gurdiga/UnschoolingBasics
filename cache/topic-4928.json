I&#39;m not sure I can go 10 yrs, but I know someday we&#39;ll all miss these years.<br/>\n <br/>\nAndy was 3 and a few months before he toilet trained.  I was beginning to worry he&#39;d never get it right because he just never minded being &#39;wet&#39; and was more than happy to change his clothes several times a day.  At 8, he still has the same tendency to change clothes several times a day! <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

As I unschool my children ages 3 and 9 months I unschool myself. I have so much more self-trust, generosity, and joy. I grew up in a rigid household and hated school until college and Grad school. It is a blessing to just let go of layers and layers of false junk.  have found it difficult to be around parents who do not unschool (i.e. most people I know.) It feels hurtful to be judged as a neglient parent when you have given how you parent/school literally hundreds of hours of thought. It seems at least among the preschool set that setting ridiculous limits and constant time-outs are the standard thing. Already I&#39;m getting asked all the time about my three-year old who is not potty trained, still wants to pretend nurse and has no bedtime etc etc. Everyone around me is filling out applications for schools and we&#39;re just learning all the time!  Yes, the judgement goes both ways! Yesterday we painted mandalas, made a cake that looked like my husband (Chocolate sprinkles are great for beards), and made valentines.
