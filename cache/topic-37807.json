Families are the experts and fun is the name of<br/>\nthe game - every activity is for the whole family, children are the<br/>\nfeature of the event and everything is open to them. The speakers are<br/>\neither parents of unschooled children, or grown unschoolers<br/>\nthemselves. There are also more intimate interactive circle chats on<br/>\na wide range of topics, and loads of &quot;Funshops&quot; - like workshops,<br/>\nonly so much more FUN - where you can discover new talents and<br/>\nskills, or share one of your own! The unschooling talent show is<br/>\nalways a huge hit, as is the big family barefoot boogie dance! Folks<br/>\nof all ages can hock their handmade wares at the &quot;Un&quot;trepreneurial<br/>\nFair. And Amy Steinberg, who performed a fabulously energetic concert<br/>\nlast year will be back to do it again this year:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.myspace.com/amysteinberg\">http://www.myspace.com/amysteinberg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd because we cannot bear to part at the end of all this fun, we<br/>\nspend the Monday picnicing at a terrific nearby park.<br/>\n<br/>\nDads are a huge part of the event too, speaking, leading funshops,<br/>\nand having gatherings of their own that are sometimes referred to by<br/>\nthe beverage-inspired moniker &quot;SSUD&quot;s (the Secret Society of<br/>\nUnschooling Dads).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a pretty cool feeling just to be surrounded by families of all<br/>\nages who live unschooling every day, and totally get your life<br/>\nwithout you having to explain a thing! We literally take over the<br/>\nhotel, which is a sight in itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a sneak peek at what the conference looks like, check out these<br/>\nvideos from past years.<br/>\n<br/>\n2008: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txdBOES235k\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txdBOES235k</a><br/>\n<br/>\n2007: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyysoHMuz_o&feature=channel_page\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyysoHMuz_o&feature=channel_page</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEn route, Seattle and Portland both offer amazing museums, science<br/>\ncenters, zoos, and children&#39;s museums. It is the perfect excuse for a<br/>\nroad trip!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out the conference website for all the details on speakers,<br/>\nmain presentations, circle chats, funshops, registration, hotel<br/>\nreservations, FAQs, etc. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lifeisgoodconference.com/)\">http://www.lifeisgoodconference.com/)</a>.<br/>\nThere is also a Yahoo Group set up for questions, chatter, intros,<br/>\nideas, etc. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LifeisGoodconference/)\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LifeisGoodconference/)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou are encouraged to pass this message along to any other lists/<br/>\npeople you think might find it of interest.</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/txdBOES235k?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"},{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/OyysoHMuz_o?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]}],"prevTopicId":37791,"nextTopicId":37733}}
