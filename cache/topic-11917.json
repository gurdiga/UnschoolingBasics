The 1989 version of the ordinance required a minimum of 300 <br/>\nsquare feet of habitable floor space2  for the first occupant and an <br/>\nadditional 200 square feet for each additional occupant. Codified <br/>\nOrdinance § 1387.14, the version of the ordinance now being <br/>\nchallenged by Housing Advocates was adopted in September 1991. The <br/>\n1991 occupancy ordinance requires a minimum of 200 square feet of <br/>\nhabitable space for the first occupant and 150 additional square <br/>\nfeet for each additional occupant. The ordinance further requires a <br/>\nminimum of 650 square feet of habitable space for dwellings having <br/>\nfour occupants. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe deposition testimony of John Marrelli, the Bedford Heights <br/>\nBuilding Commissioner at the time the ordinance was enacted, was <br/>\npresented at trial. Marrelli testified that the ordinance was <br/>\npassed, in part, due to residents&#39; concerns about too many people <br/>\nliving in one apartment, unsupervised children, children playing in <br/>\nunsafe environments (e.g., balconies, parking lots, hallways, <br/>\nelevators), noise, and overcrowding. Further, in response to <br/>\nplaintiff&#39;s counsel&#39;s question of whether &quot;[t]he law was directed <br/>\ntowards problems associated with children and problems that other <br/>\ntenants, adult tenants, were experiencing in relation to these <br/>\nchildren,&quot; Marrelli answered, &quot;Yes.&quot; J.A. at 126. However, Marrelli <br/>\nalso stated that in passing the ordinance, the city &quot;did not look at <br/>\n[the ordinance] as having an impact on any specific group of <br/>\npersons. . . .We weren&#39;t trying to define who could live in the <br/>\nsuites, but how many.&quot; J.A. at 129. He further stated that the <br/>\nordinance was passed to address &quot;[h]ealth, safety, and sanitation&quot; <br/>\nproblems that could result from overcrowding. J.A. at 137. According <br/>\nto Marrelli, the ordinance was enacted as a result of the 1988 <br/>\namendments to the FHA, and in response to landlords&#39; and tenants&#39; <br/>\ncomplaints regarding overcrowding. Thus, after the FHA amendments <br/>\nwere passed, information regarding these amendments, along with a <br/>\ndraft of the proposed ordinance, was submitted to local apartment <br/>\nlandlords/owners. Bedford Heights, working with the <br/>\nlandlords/owners, developed the square footage requirements included <br/>\nin the final version of the ordinance. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, B. Allen Clutter, Vice-President and General Manager of <br/>\nOwners Management Company, testified at trial.3  Clutter stated that <br/>\nalthough using a square footage occupancy standard is not <br/>\nunreasonable, for consistency purposes, Owners Management imposes a <br/>\ntwo-person-per- bedroom standard. Clutter further admitted that he <br/>\nwas aware that Owners Management was in violation of Bedford <br/>\nHeights&#39;s occupancy ordinance due to the company&#39;s two-person-per-<br/>\nbedroom standard. A letter Clutter wrote to the Mayor of Bedford <br/>\nHeights shortly before enactment of the 1989 occupancy ordinance was <br/>\nalso presented at trial. This letter referenced the 1988 FHA <br/>\nAmendments and pointed out that Bedford Heights did not have an <br/>\noccupancy ordinance. Clutter indicated in his letter that he <br/>\nknew &quot;there [would] be a great demand for family housing in this <br/>\narea because of the school system,&quot; and thus, he &quot;urge[d] [the <br/>\nMayor] to consider proposing such [occupancy] standards so that over <br/>\ncrowding does not occur.&quot; J.A. at 523. <br/>\n<br/>\nHmmmm.<br/>\nWe lived in 2 different apartments owned by Owner&#39;s Management for 7 <br/>\nyears before moving into our house 3 years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like a good way to get more rent money if families are <br/>\nforced to get bigger apartments if they have more people.
