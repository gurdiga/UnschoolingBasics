My girls are now 8 and 10 and I<br/>\nhave always lain down with them while they&#39;ve gone to sleep.  Sometimes in<br/>\nthe past it has frustrated me occasionally, but for the most part, I&#39;ve<br/>\nthoroughly enjoyed that time with them.  It is a time that they talk about<br/>\ntheir days and ask thought provoking questions.  I only have two kids and<br/>\nthey shared a bedroom up until a month ago so it was fairly easy to do.<br/>\nGoing to bed has always been a relaxing thing to do at our house.  Time to<br/>\ncuddle and share.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest has always slept in her sister&#39;s room (when she didn&#39;t sleep in<br/>\nmine) and she recently decided to move to her own room.  She&#39;s done it twice<br/>\nbefore but it never lasted more than 2 nights so I wasn&#39;t sure how it would<br/>\ngo this time.  But this time she was determined and part of the reason for<br/>\nthat is that she wanted to make her room into a barn, complete with a horse<br/>\nstall, and sleep in the barn every night.  :-)  I told her that her sister<br/>\nisn&#39;t comfortable going to sleep alone and that she was welcome to move out,<br/>\nbut that I would still lay with her sister while she goes to sleep.  I told<br/>\nher that I would spend some time with her in her bed each night talking and<br/>\ncuddling and make sure she was comfortable but that then I would leave<br/>\nbecause her sister just isn&#39;t ready to go to sleep alone. She said that was<br/>\nfine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe moved out and we started on her room.  We pulled off the old pooh bear<br/>\nborder and painted the walls.  Then she sponged horse shoe prints all over<br/>\nthe walls and we asked my dad if he&#39;d be willing to build her a stall in her<br/>\nroom.  He said he would.  She slept in there every night for a month (except<br/>\none really windy night) and I know she is there for good. She is going to<br/>\nsleep alone now but she feels really good about it.  Her stall got built<br/>\ntoday and it is really cool.  If anyone wants to see it, I&#39;ll send you<br/>\npictures privately.  Just let me know off list.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people forget that there are other options than leaving their<br/>\nchildren to go to sleep alone.  This has worked for us.  It didn&#39;t create<br/>\noverly dependent children. It just allowed them to transition to sleeping<br/>\nalone at their own pace.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy older dd is by nature more sensitive/needy than most.  I have faith that<br/>\nin her own time she too will be able to go to sleep with out me being beside<br/>\nher.  (Actually, she fell asleep last night before I got to her room, but I<br/>\nwoke her and climbed in with her anyway because she cherished the time we<br/>\nspend talking and cuddling.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s sweet that they were able to transition to sleeping alone when<br/>\nthey were ready.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141959941,"authorName":"Judy Anderson","from":"&quot;Judy Anderson&quot; &lt;temair@...&gt;","profile":"kblackclaw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: I think I get the effects of control now","postDate":"1111421194","msgId":5282,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE1HRUxKTUNKRkhQTUZDQU5HSU9LR0VLQkVBQUEudGVtYWlyQGFkZWxwaGlhLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGQxbXIwNCthMHFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5280,"nextInTopic":5286,"prevInTime":5281,"nextInTime":5283,"topicId":5277,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Actually, I did our usual naptime routine, read a book and sing a song before I kiss her goodnight.

It was fun <br/>\nfor a while, we were all laughing, too, and having a good time <br/>\ntogether. BUT - being mom - I could tell there was an edge of hysteria <br/>\n- a sort of loss of control - going on with her. I knew that I needed <br/>\nto get her settled down or something was going to set her off in a <br/>\nnegative way and she was going to end up upset.<br/>\n<br/>\nI KNOW this about her - having seen it repeatedly. When she&#39;s really <br/>\ntired, she gets that way. Sometimes she gets really pesty - goes around <br/>\nfrom person to person and does things that are sure to be irritating to <br/>\nthem - like leaning against the back of their chair and wiggling around <br/>\nor tapping something, making a little persistent noise, close to them. <br/>\nWhen I start to hear, &quot;Rosie, could you stop that, please,&quot; over and <br/>\nover, I know she&#39;s worn out and that if I don&#39;t help her out, she&#39;ll <br/>\nprobably explode when somebody eventually snaps at her too strongly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - this is pretty subtle - her dad doesn&#39;t see it coming. But last <br/>\nnight Roxana saw it coming and quietly said to me, &quot;Mom, maybe we <br/>\nshould go watch tv for a bit, help Rosie settle down.&quot;  She was right - <br/>\nwe put in an episode of West Wing on dvd (one we&#39;d watched already, <br/>\nseveral times) and Rosie laid down on the couch and was asleep in about <br/>\n45 seconds. The rest of us then turned the tv off and did other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t make a kid lie down if she was fighting, Judy. I&#39;d find a <br/>\nway to help her settle down. But sometimes this process has to start <br/>\nearly enough - if a kid gets too tired, it is harder for them to settle <br/>\ndown. So - instead of forcing her to lie down - try coming up with a <br/>\nlist of ways you have to help her settle down -- warm bath, warm milk, <br/>\nsoft music, lower the lights, cuddle up together to read aloud, listen <br/>\nto a calm tape (see Jim Weiss&#39;s relaxing tapes), back rub, ride in the <br/>\ncar or stroller, nursing, watching tv, or whatever....try different <br/>\nthings. I do think the key is being alert to the signs of readiness to <br/>\nsleep so that you can get started supporting her need before she&#39;s <br/>\noverly tired, though. This is probably especially true for kids who <br/>\nhave been going to sleep on a schedule - they aren&#39;t all that in touch <br/>\nwith their own personal signals and might ignore or even fight it when <br/>\nthey need to sleep. Your goal might be to make sleeping something they <br/>\nlook forward to - something pleasant - think about how much nicer the <br/>\nworld looks to them when they wake up - sleep isn&#39;t something negative <br/>\nto be fought - it is a GOOD thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"scrapgal","from":"&quot;scrapgal&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: I think I get the effects of control now","postDate":"1111420740","msgId":5279,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQxbXIwNCthMHFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PE1HRUxKTUNKRkhQTUZDQU5HSU9LQ0VKT0VBQUEudGVtYWlyQGFkZWxwaGlhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":5277,"nextInTopic":5280,"prevInTime":5278,"nextInTime":5280,"topicId":5277,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ate a ... the box, I ... anyway. ... to eat ... one in the ... does.

If you offer <br/>\nhim food he will eat it.  If he walks through the kitchen he will <br/>\nstop and eat something.

Last night I sat down an ate a<br/>\nwhole box of Samoas after the kids went to bed.  Halfway through the box, I<br/>\nrealized I didn&#39;t want to eat them anymore, but I finished the box anyway.<br/>\nWhy? I asked myself.  Because I was afraid I wouldn&#39;t get a chance to eat<br/>\nthem later.  That of course was very silly, because I am the only one in the<br/>\nhouse who likes them.  That&#39;s when I &quot;got&quot; what food control does.  I am<br/>\nstill struggling with it, though.  I still find myself saying that they just<br/>\nneed to wait ten minutes until dinner is ready.  I&#39;m working on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith bedtime, I got it yesterday when Lauren got tired for her nap.  I had<br/>\nnot made her take her nap because she didn&#39;t want to take one.  By 4:00 she<br/>\nwas exhausted and started throwing fits.  I picked her up, told ehr it was<br/>\nobvious she was tired and let her choose where she wanted to nap, my bed or<br/>\nhers.  She fought and fought, but I made her lay down anyway.  Five minutes<br/>\nlater, she was sound asleep.  So with bedtime, I think I went to the other<br/>\nextreme.  I think I found the happy middle ground now in regard to sleep.  I<br/>\nthought food would be first, but I guess not.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5209,"nextTopicId":5296}}
