To see your children grow up to<br/>\nhave the ability to confidently decide what is best, to seek out<br/>\nknowledge independently, and to work toward goals that will allow them<br/>\nthe lifestyles they desire.  Just consider yourself along for the<br/>\nride, on a train if you like, but not as the driver.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s wonderful to be the one for young minds to bounce their questions<br/>\noff of, to listen as they make observations about the world, to be by<br/>\ntheir sides as they surpass your skills and abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone asked me recently if I intended to put my kids in school &#39;some<br/>\nday&#39; - I responded by saying &quot;Never Ever&quot;  This experience is too<br/>\nrewarding to give away.  But, I&#39;ll tell you, during a recent round of<br/>\n&quot;I want to go to school&quot;, I finally consented and gave full<br/>\nunconditional permission for them to explore this fantasy they<br/>\nimagine.  After several days, my son came back and announced that he<br/>\nwould prefer to homeschool.   I was so sad to have given this<br/>\npermission, but so empowered when the decision to continue came from<br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nSalam,<br/>\nNatalie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 5/15/06, Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;Unschooling is the journey, not the destination.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  That was awesome Mary.

Unschooling my children has enabled me to see my children for Who They Are right NOW rather than focusing on who I need to mold them into for the future. It has enabled me to live in the moment with my family without fear. I can appreciate the beauty of what my children *do* know, while still helping them experience the things that are new for them. Unschooling has empowered me to question the answers instead of only answering the questions. It has enabled me to learn from every experience without being afraid of failing. There is no failure in unschooling. There is only learning from any misteps and moving forward. Unschooling is the journey, not the destination.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://zenmommasgarden.blogspot.com/\">http://zenmommasgarden.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water.
