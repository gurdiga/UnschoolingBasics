My whole life, I would stare at <br/>\nthings in my house and think I *should* take care of it. Now it never <br/>\ntakes me more than 2 months, because every week I look for something <br/>\nthat needs to be done/maintained/deep-cleaned in that room. If I plan <br/>\nit and it doesn&#39;t happen, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ll NEVER do it--I know <br/>\nI&#39;ll do it next month.

In my years of <br/>\nhomeschooling, I&#39;ve seen people try to define it by making it fit <br/>\nwhat their view of unschooling is supposed to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just as Dayna mentioned in a video about sitting with the<br/>\n&gt; kids as they watch TV, unschooling doesn&#39;t mean unsupervised<br/>\n&gt; chaos.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh my, is that what you think unschooling is?  Unsupervised chaos?  I <br/>\nwork harder at being an unschooling mom than I worked when I had <br/>\nrules in my house for cleaning, bedtimes, schoolwork, etc.  I&#39;m <br/>\nalways amazed when I see someone suggest that unschooling is taking <br/>\nthe easy way out of parenting by letting their kids run wild and do <br/>\nwhatever they want.  My kids aren&#39;t wild and while they do things <br/>\nthey want to do, they&#39;re done with my help and usually my <br/>\nsupervision.  I take full responsibility of what my children are <br/>\ndoing.  I truly believe children just want to live happily and need <br/>\nmy support to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As a family, we&#39;ve decided that chores makes the house run<br/>\n&gt; smoothly for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So your whole family sat down to discuss this and everyone <br/>\nvolunteered to have a chore list?  Does that mean they can choose not <br/>\nto do the chores if they don&#39;t want to?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The other mom asked the question about how to keep it all clean<br/>\n&gt; and I answered her with what works for my unschooled kids. Like<br/>\n&gt; it or not, unschoolers come in a rainbow of degrees and you have<br/>\n&gt; to accept that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure that unschoolers really come in a rainbow of degrees.  <br/>\nDo they?  What are the degrees?  How are they defined?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Letting little kids stay up all hours of the night and doing all<br/>\n&gt; the cleaning yourself (or just ignoring it) is fine if that works<br/>\n&gt; for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, our unschooling lifestyle is more centered on what works <br/>\nfor all of us, not just me, my DH or just my kids.  We are treated <br/>\nequally.  I&#39;ve seen lots of unschoolers on this list and others who <br/>\nfeel that living freely and joyfully is unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, If it worked for the mom who asked the question she<br/>\n&gt; probably wouldn&#39;t have asked it.<br/>\n&gt; Peace, Cori<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Or maybe she&#39;s interested in learning how others who have no <br/>\nrestrictions or expectations of their children view this topic.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen on other parenting and homeschooling boards and the general <br/>\ntopics like chores and bedtimes are very different from what I see on <br/>\nunschooling lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Keeping your house tidy","postDate":"1217367952","msgId":34921,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwNzI5MTQ0NXAyOGE3ZDhmZG85MTM4NTk2MzYxODRlMDBAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwNzI5MTQzNW00MDRjZmYwZHlmMjYwMjA1Zjk5OTJhNDkyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc2bG4waitsa290QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDEzNDU5MS4xMTY2OC5xbUB3ZWIzMzIwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+CSA8YTU0MWIxOTcwODA3MjkwNDE3bTQyNDhiM2YzbmEzOGIxNThjYWEwYjRiNGNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8M2E5M2ZmZjEwODA3MjkxNDM1bTQwNGNmZjBkeWYyNjAyMDVmOTk5MmE0OTJAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34919,"nextInTopic":34924,"prevInTime":34920,"nextInTime":34922,"topicId":34868,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can really bugger up a post.

Most of  <br/>\nour kids DO get to this point and it is very sweet when it happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they aren&#39;t getting a choice, then they are not doing it as a  <br/>\ncourtesy to you, they are doing because you&#39;re making them do it. They  <br/>\naren&#39;t showing that they care about you, they&#39;re not showing  <br/>\nconsideration, they aren&#39;t even showing appreciation of what you do  <br/>\nfor them, they&#39;re doing it because they have no choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone&#39;s goal is really to get somebody else to pick up the toys,  <br/>\nthen making the kids do it is certainly workable. If a family has a  <br/>\nsystem set up and nobody is complaining or unhappy about it, then they  <br/>\nmay not see any problem and may wonder why all the discussion about  <br/>\nchores at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if what i just wrote was clear - my point is that someone  <br/>\nmight have children who are compliant types, who &quot;go along&quot; with mom&#39;s  <br/>\nplan without resistance. And, Mom might be especially good at getting  <br/>\nwilling cooperation. It could work. We&#39;ve had periods of time in my  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s lives during which I could say, &quot;Let&#39;s all spend some time  <br/>\ncleaning the house,&quot; and they&#39;d just do it with great attitudes. I&#39;ve  <br/>\nhad other times that I could solicit their help if I made it fun - we  <br/>\nplayed &#39;army&#39; - I was their sergeant and would give orders - they&#39;d  <br/>\nsalute and say YES SIR and run and do it. We played search and rescue  <br/>\ngames. We played spy games. It was really quite fun and the kids  <br/>\nremember those as games as much as cleaning times.<br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly see no negative repercussions from the above - a key  <br/>\nelement, though, was that we did it only as long as the kids were into  <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, that is quite different than chore charts with &quot;consequences&quot;  <br/>\nfor noncompliance. I see the possibility of negative repercussions and  <br/>\none of those is that kids who don&#39;t have a choice can&#39;t MAKE a choice  <br/>\nand so they can&#39;t &quot;show courtesy&quot; if they are doing what they have  <br/>\nbeen ordered to do. They can show compliance or resistance, that&#39;s  <br/>\nabout it. Lots of times kids respond with passive resistance - they do  <br/>\nthe minimum they can get by with. What are they learning from that?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever I went through a phase of trying to &quot;require&quot; chores, I&#39;d end  <br/>\nup having to list every little thing I wanted done. I could not say,  <br/>\n&quot;Clean the kitchen,&quot; I&#39;d have to say, &quot;Unload the dishwasher putting  <br/>\nthings in their correct places. Rinse the dishes well before putting  <br/>\nthem into the dishwasher. Be sure to load the dishwasher correctly or  <br/>\nthe dishes won&#39;t get clean. Run all the garbage down the garbage  <br/>\ndisposal. Sort all of the trash into the trash can or the recycling  <br/>\nbox. Put away any food that is out. Cover dishes before putting them  <br/>\ninto the refrigerator. Don&#39;t put utensils into the refrigerator with  <br/>\nthe leftovers. Wipe off all the counters. Wipe off the stove top.  <br/>\nClean the sink. Clean the little counter behind the sink. Sweep the  <br/>\nfloor. Be sure to sweep the corners and edges. Use the dustpan to pick  <br/>\nup what you swept and throw it into the trash. Put the broom and  <br/>\ndustpan away.&quot; And on and on. They&#39;d ONLY do what I told them to do -  <br/>\nno more.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrast, when they &quot;choose&quot; to clean the kitchen, they take pride  <br/>\nin it and do a great job and they notice that the counters need wiping  <br/>\nand the floor swept and so on, and I don&#39;t have to tell them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur biggest problem is not lack of willingness to help - they want to  <br/>\nhelp and know that it feels good to be helpful. Our biggest problem is  <br/>\nthat we ALL have other things we&#39;d rather do and, minute by minute,  <br/>\nhousework always gets a lower priority than something else. So,  <br/>\nsometimes I ask for help, because that supports them in doing what  <br/>\nthey want to do, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nON the other hand, my oldest daughter now has her own house to care  <br/>\nfor and she does just fine. It gets super messy (just like ours would)  <br/>\nand then she cleans it all up in a frenzy of concentrated effort.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s always pretty much been my style, too. As I&#39;ve gotten older, I  <br/>\nhave begun to enjoy keeping things a little cleaner and more organized  <br/>\nby doing more ongoing day-to-day maintenance, rather than spending a  <br/>\nhard-working day cleaning the house every so often. But, really, it is  <br/>\nclear to me that this is just a preference - either way is fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":295247339,"authorName":"Cori Belliveau","from":"&quot;Cori Belliveau&quot; &lt;coribell@...&gt;","profile":"corilmnop","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Keeping your house tidy","postDate":"1217362817","msgId":34926,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE1NDFiMTk3MDgwNzI5MTMyMGs3NGVhM2RlZXc4YjZmMDI1Y2JiMWVkYmU5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc2bmRpNStuOGs5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDQ1OTYwNS40NjA4OC5xbUB3ZWIzNTQwNi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+CSA8ZzZuZGk1K244azlAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34925,"nextInTopic":34929,"prevInTime":34925,"nextInTime":34927,"topicId":34868,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ll be happy to clean up my toys when the girls are old enough to cook for me ;-) ...

Nothing<br/>\n&gt; is all that consistent so that I have that perfect house all of the<br/>\n&gt; time. However, when I really have a need for a clean and tidy house<br/>\n&gt; I can get pretty creative and I enjoy the creative process of<br/>\n&gt; planning how to do it. I don&#39;t usually stick to one routine because<br/>\n&gt; it gets boring for me. Here are a few suggestions that helped me:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1) I need adrenaline or excitement to get into the mood for<br/>\n&gt; cleaning, etc. Sometimes I plan to have someone over just to keep<br/>\n&gt; the excitement high, or I try to &quot;Surprise&quot; my husband with a really<br/>\n&gt; clean house, or I play cleaning games with the kids. One of my kids<br/>\n&gt; (I have 3 and 5 yo boys and I&#39;m 34 weeks pregnant with another boy)<br/>\n&gt; really likes to play I spy. I usually spy something wrong with a<br/>\n&gt; room and he puts everything back where it belongs. Once everything<br/>\n&gt; is back where it belongs, I tell him what the secret item was and if<br/>\n&gt; he put it away. Then he does the same thing in a room that I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; cleaning. My 3yo doesn&#39;t like to do it very much if his older<br/>\n&gt; brother is playing too because then he thinks that he lost.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2) If I have a lot of house work to do and my kids are bored, I<br/>\n&gt; play while I&#39;m cleaning. I turn into some character and the<br/>\n&gt; silliness begins. We have pretended that our house is a hotel and we<br/>\n&gt; are getting ready for a king and queen to come visit. I play the<br/>\n&gt; bossy head maid and my son loves to be the irresponsible janitor. We<br/>\n&gt; have also made giant piles of laundry to jump in and throw around.<br/>\n&gt; Then the kids usually sort it ALL for me. My 3 yo loves to clean<br/>\n&gt; with me. He has his own cleaning cart (a kid&#39;s shopping cart)<br/>\n&gt; complete with vinegar and water spray bottles, baking soda (for<br/>\n&gt; scrubbing), rags, dusters, trash bags tied on the sides, and a bucket<br/>\n&gt; and small mop. He loves to wet his hands pour baking soda on them<br/>\n&gt; and scrub my shower.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3) Another thing I like to do is make a BIGGER mess. For example,<br/>\n&gt; if a room is really bugging me, I like to start from scratch and<br/>\n&gt; reorganize or rearrange. My kids love this! And my oldest asks for<br/>\n&gt; days if we can redo the house. I recently emptied my entire pantry<br/>\n&gt; onto the kitchen table and putting it all back took all day, but then<br/>\n&gt; I had a really neat pantry. The kids stayed busy checking out all of<br/>\n&gt; the food that they usually don&#39;t see and then they loved helping me<br/>\n&gt; decide how to organize it all back on the shelves. My oldest helped<br/>\n&gt; me until the very end.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4) Another thing that plays into the adrenaline thing for me is to<br/>\n&gt; set a timer. When the kids ask why I&#39;m moving so fast, I tell them<br/>\n&gt; and sometimes they want to get in on the fun. I usually say<br/>\n&gt; something like: I&#39;m trying to get this room picked up in 3 minutes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 5) Baskets are great for a quick tidy. I don&#39;t like to sort the<br/>\n&gt; baskets, but I just stick them in the guest room or closet and my<br/>\n&gt; husband doesn&#39;t mind doing some quick sorts once in a while. My<br/>\n&gt; husband is much better at picking up and I&#39;m much better at deep<br/>\n&gt; cleaning so that&#39;s usually how things get done around here.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 6) I am very comfortable in a mess and I think that helps to keep<br/>\n&gt; things low stress. However, I think we all function better when<br/>\n&gt; things are much more tidy, so that&#39;s the way I try to keep things.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 7) Try to think about how your kids play and how the &quot;mess&quot; is<br/>\n&gt; created. For example, my boys love to play legos, but if they played<br/>\n&gt; with them all over the floor I&#39;d be picking them up for hours. We<br/>\n&gt; use a play table (large train table with drawers under) for their<br/>\n&gt; legos. This way they never have to pick them up. It&#39;s an ongoing<br/>\n&gt; creative process. Ask yourself &quot;What is making the mess?&quot; &quot;How can<br/>\n&gt; I make things easier on myself?&quot; Get creative. My boys used to<br/>\n&gt; leave their dress up clothes all over the house until I created a<br/>\n&gt; special &quot;dressing room&quot; in one of our closets. We have a family<br/>\n&gt; closet for all of our clothes, so that has freed up some other<br/>\n&gt; closets and those are great places to make &quot;messes&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 8) Use more &quot;grown up&quot; things for play. For example, we used to<br/>\n&gt; have all kinds of art supplies for the kids but they always wanted to<br/>\n&gt; use my husband&#39;s stuff. We have gotten rid of all of the &quot;kid&quot; art<br/>\n&gt; stuff and have simplified our art supplies. Another example of this<br/>\n&gt; is tools. My 3yo loves tools. He had a bunch of fake tools, but<br/>\n&gt; they would get scattered all over the house. I have started helping<br/>\n&gt; him use adult tools instead and he has REALLY enjoyed this! He likes<br/>\n&gt; to hammer nails into boxes or even wood.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 9) Consider the length of time that your kids stay interested in a<br/>\n&gt; toy. Is it a toy that they just dig out, look at it for a second and<br/>\n&gt; throw it aside? I think that it&#39;s important for kids to &quot;check out&quot;<br/>\n&gt; toys, but we usually do this at toy stores, garage sales, and other<br/>\n&gt; kid&#39;s houses. I don&#39;t keep things that don&#39;t get played with. If<br/>\n&gt; they play with their stuffed animals once a month for a long and fun<br/>\n&gt; play time, then I&#39;d keep a basket of them in the top of the closet<br/>\n&gt; for when they&#39;re ready for them. But if they have a couple of<br/>\n&gt; stuffed animals that they just throw aside to get to other toys, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; get rid of them.

I was wondering what strategies any of you might<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like to pass on in terms of keeping your house tidy in your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschooling world. I have two boys - 5 and almost 3 - and I have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; say the state of the house is really bugging me. We spend anywhere<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from 30 minutes to an hour every evening tidying up (I&#39;m not talking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about cleaning, just picking up), and what happens a lot is I start<br/>\n&gt; &gt; snapping at the kids (which I really don&#39;t like, because I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; normally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pretty laid back and mellow), but it&#39;s usually just me putting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything away, while they move one block at a time using a tiny<br/>\n&gt; lego<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wheelbarrow to push it across the floor:)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We only pick up once a day, but still, it&#39;s starting to really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; irritate me. I probably am a perfectionist in that I find I just<br/>\n&gt; feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a lot better and my mind feels clearer when I am not looking out on<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lot of clutter (not to mention the injured feet after stepping on<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; umpteenth pointy block in the kitchen floor) Interested to know any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; strategies you all have either practical in terms of tidying, or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mental (i.e., coping strategies for me).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":274177100,"authorName":"Vickisue Gray","from":"Vickisue Gray &lt;vickisue_gray@...&gt;","profile":"viickisan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:Keeping your house tidy","postDate":"1217352416","msgId":34901,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc3OTU4NC4xNTc0Ni5xbUB3ZWI1NDEwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34894,"nextInTopic":34903,"prevInTime":34900,"nextInTime":34902,"topicId":34868,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"All these posts have been making me think of this past weekend.  See, last Friday early morning, I was awoken to what felt like a bug on me.  I slapped my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-10465722\">All these posts have been making me think of this past weekend.  See, last Friday early morning, I was awoken to what felt like a bug on me.  I slapped my arm and sure enough, it was!  I was so totally grossed out.  My spouse laughed and said no matter how clean the house is, we live in Florida, in a swamp, and bugs happen.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m 45yo!  I&#39;ve lived in Florida 31 years and never had a bug in my bed!  Needless to say, I wasn&#39;t sleeping in there until the room was cleaned from top to bottom including moving the mattress, heavy furniture, etc.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy spouse just told me I was being silly and that he could get the whole house clean and still have time to hang out at the glider field.<br/>\n <br/>\nWeeeeelllll....hmmmmm....

I am a 47 year old single mom of 10 year old Zack. I  <br/>\nconsider myself an unschooling mom in progress. <br/>\n <br/>\nHave been unschooling for the past year, after getting thoroughly  fed up <br/>\nwith the inept schooling system and mean school teachers. Short story on  it: I <br/>\nhad been looking into unschooling for several weeks (after realizing my  son&#39;s <br/>\ncurrent teacher was especially awful). Zack did not know about it  yet. He <br/>\ncame home one day, crying, after she had embarrassed him by  punishing him in <br/>\nfront of the whole class for something really minor. He  looked at me incredibly <br/>\nseriously and said, &quot;Mom, I don&#39;t want to go back  to school.&quot; His jaw dropped <br/>\nwhen I said, &quot;Oh honey, I don&#39;t want you to,  either.&quot; And the rest is <br/>\nhistory. He is such a happier boy. Our  relationship is so much more fluid and easy. <br/>\nI have stopped yelling. It&#39;s truly  transformed our lives.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that everything is easy, by any means. I still struggle  with <br/>\ngetting the house clean and usually I just make Zack help. I&#39;s not always  fun <br/>\ninitially, but I found that if we put on his hard rock music (Linkin Park is  <br/>\nhis fave) we usually go to town and actually enjoy the work (with  several <br/>\ndancing breaks in between). <br/>\nBUT...I just asked him to read your  post, Beth, and it brought up a great <br/>\ndiscussion between us. We are going to  change our MO. We agreed that two things <br/>\nhave to happen for it to work and  both of us be happy. The first is that I <br/>\nhave to really allow it to be  his choice to help--that if he says no, I need <br/>\nto accept it and move on. The  second is that Zack needs to work on wanting to <br/>\nhelp a little more. He  said that after he read your post, he thinks he will. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe will see. <br/>\n <br/>\nAgain, thank you!<br/>\n <br/>\nTamlyn  Jordan<br/>\n405-990-9524<br/>\nwww.univera.com<br/>\n<br/>\n_www.mynetimpact.com_ (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.univera.com/)\">http://www.univera.com/)</a> <br/>\nUse visitor ID#  1252031<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn why medical doctors use and recommend our life changing  products.. <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mynetimpact.com/doctors.cfm_\">http://www.mynetimpact.com/doctors.cfm_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mynetimpact.com/doctors.cfm)\">http://www.mynetimpact.com/doctors.cfm)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Get fantasy football with free live scoring.

Marry someone who is neater and way more organized than you,<br/>\nand out of love and respect for one another, he&#39;ll help you devise systems<br/>\nfor keeping all the mess at bay lol! Short of that, we have laundry baskets<br/>\n(plastic, with venting holes in the sides, you can get them at K-Mart or<br/>\nTarget) for quick tidy-ups. Having bins that have words and pictures that<br/>\nrepresent what goes in them helps the little ones know where things go when<br/>\nit&#39;s clean-up time. I think it&#39;s a bit much to expect young children to<br/>\nunderstand our (often flawed) systems of organization, so the pictorial<br/>\nrepresentations give them a clue, and adding the words helps encourage word<br/>\nrecognition. Personally, I have no problem with paying older children to<br/>\nhelp around the house, as long as they are happy with the arrangement. Right<br/>\nnow I have a mother&#39;s helper, and I pay them to play with the kids and<br/>\nclean-up before they go, so what&#39;s the difference? <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I noticed with my oldest (I have two daughters, 5 yrs and 2 yrs),<br/>\nwhen there is too much disorder, she doesn&#39;t want to play with anything, so<br/>\nthat is one good reason to bring the house back to order fairly regularly.<br/>\nShe is beginning to understand this about herself, and will sometimes<br/>\nwillingly help out when it&#39;s time to clean-up. Other times she doesn&#39;t want<br/>\nto help, usually because she is already involved in something else, which is<br/>\nfine with me. This is her time in life to have this freedom. My parents<br/>\nnever modeled happy clean-up time. It was always an issue in our home, as I<br/>\nsuspect it was in many other&#39;s homes. I think this is why so many regard<br/>\nclean-up as a chore. I think we all have a real opportunity here to do<br/>\nsomething different, something that will give our children the message that<br/>\nthey are loved and nurtured and respected, that they are not a burden to us,<br/>\nthat their play brings joy to a house, not aggravation. So when I see my<br/>\ndaughter frustrated because she can&#39;t find parts to a toy or game she wants<br/>\nto play, I help her find the pieces, and yes, I will talk with her about<br/>\nways to avoid missing pieces in the future, by putting things back where<br/>\nthey belong, but I&#39;ll do it with love and care, because she deserves that.<br/>\nHer job is to play and explore her world, and she is marvelous at it. My job<br/>\nis to help her to do her job well. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo get some baskets, make some picture/word signs to tape onto them, play<br/>\nclean-up games (with the baskets, almost anything can become a :basketball&quot;<br/>\ntype game), have clean-up races, have fun. Your kids deserve it, and so do<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":350349869,"authorName":"janewalker_sc","from":"&quot;janewalker_sc&quot; &lt;scottjanewalker@...&gt;","profile":"janewalker_sc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Keeping your house tidy","postDate":"1217345925","msgId":34907,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc2bmRpNStuOGs5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ1OTYwNS40NjA4OC5xbUB3ZWIzNTQwNi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34906,"nextInTopic":34908,"prevInTime":34906,"nextInTime":34908,"topicId":34868,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Jeanette, I m a new member coming out of lurkdom because of your fabulous post, Jeanette!

Nothing <br/>\n </span></blockquote>is all that consistent so that I have that perfect house all of the <br/>\ntime.  However, when I really have a need for a clean and tidy house <br/>\nI can get pretty creative and I enjoy the creative process of <br/>\nplanning how to do it.  I don&#39;t usually stick to one routine because <br/>\nit gets boring for me.  Here are a few suggestions that helped me:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1)  I need adrenaline or excitement to get into the mood for <br/>\n </span></blockquote>cleaning, etc.  Sometimes I plan to have someone over just to keep <br/>\nthe excitement high, or I try to &quot;Surprise&quot; my husband with a really <br/>\nclean house, or I play cleaning games with the kids.  One of my kids <br/>\n(I have 3 and 5 yo boys and I&#39;m 34 weeks pregnant with another boy) <br/>\nreally likes to play I spy.  I usually spy something wrong with a <br/>\nroom and he puts everything back where it belongs.  Once everything <br/>\nis back where it belongs, I tell him what the secret item was and if <br/>\nhe put it away.  Then he does the same thing in a room that I&#39;m <br/>\ncleaning.  My 3yo doesn&#39;t like to do it very much if his older <br/>\nbrother is playing too because then he thinks that he lost.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2)  If I have a lot of house work to do and my kids are bored, I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>play while I&#39;m cleaning.  I turn into some character and the <br/>\nsilliness begins.  We have pretended that our house is a hotel and we <br/>\nare getting ready for a king and queen to come visit.  I play the <br/>\nbossy head maid and my son loves to be the irresponsible janitor.  We <br/>\nhave also made giant piles of laundry to jump in and throw around.  <br/>\nThen the kids usually sort it ALL for me.  My 3 yo loves to clean <br/>\nwith me.  He has his own cleaning cart (a kid&#39;s shopping cart) <br/>\ncomplete with vinegar and water spray bottles, baking soda (for <br/>\nscrubbing), rags, dusters, trash bags tied on the sides, and a bucket <br/>\nand small mop.  He loves to wet his hands pour baking soda on them <br/>\nand scrub my shower.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3)  Another thing I like to do is make a BIGGER mess.  For example, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>if a room is really bugging me, I like to start from scratch and <br/>\nreorganize or rearrange.  My kids love this!  And my oldest asks for <br/>\ndays if we can redo the house.  I recently emptied my entire pantry <br/>\nonto the kitchen table and putting it all back took all day, but then <br/>\nI had a really neat pantry.  The kids stayed busy checking out all of <br/>\nthe food that they usually don&#39;t see and then they loved helping me <br/>\ndecide how to organize it all back on the shelves.  My oldest helped <br/>\nme until the very end.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4)  Another thing that plays into the adrenaline thing for me is to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>set a timer.  When the kids ask why I&#39;m moving so fast, I tell them <br/>\nand sometimes they want to get in on the fun.  I usually say <br/>\nsomething like:  I&#39;m trying to get this room picked up in 3 minutes.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5)  Baskets are great for a quick tidy.  I don&#39;t like to sort the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>baskets, but I just stick them in the guest room or closet and my <br/>\nhusband doesn&#39;t mind doing some quick sorts once in a while.  My <br/>\nhusband is much better at picking up and I&#39;m much better at deep <br/>\ncleaning so that&#39;s usually how things get done around here.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 6)  I am very comfortable in a mess and I think that helps to keep <br/>\n </span></blockquote>things low stress.  However, I think we all function better when <br/>\nthings are much more tidy, so that&#39;s the way I try to keep things.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 7)  Try to think about how your kids play and how the &quot;mess&quot; is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>created.  For example, my boys love to play legos, but if they played <br/>\nwith them all over the floor I&#39;d be picking them up for hours.  We <br/>\nuse a play table (large train table with drawers under) for their <br/>\nlegos.  This way they never have to pick them up.  It&#39;s an ongoing <br/>\ncreative process.  Ask yourself &quot;What is making the mess?&quot;  &quot;How can <br/>\nI make things easier on myself?&quot;  Get creative.  My boys used to <br/>\nleave their dress up clothes all over the house until I created a <br/>\nspecial &quot;dressing room&quot; in one of our closets.  We have a family <br/>\ncloset for all of our clothes, so that has freed up some other <br/>\nclosets and those are great places to make &quot;messes&quot;.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 8)  Use more &quot;grown up&quot; things for play.  For example, we used to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>have all kinds of art supplies for the kids but they always wanted to <br/>\nuse my husband&#39;s stuff.  We have gotten rid of all of the &quot;kid&quot; art <br/>\nstuff and have simplified our art supplies.  Another example of this <br/>\nis tools.  My 3yo loves tools.  He had a bunch of fake tools, but <br/>\nthey would get scattered all over the house.  I have started helping <br/>\nhim use adult tools instead and he has REALLY enjoyed this!  He likes <br/>\nto hammer nails into boxes or even wood.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 9)  Consider the length of time that your kids stay interested in a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>toy.  Is it a toy that they just dig out, look at it for a second and <br/>\nthrow it aside?  I think that it&#39;s important for kids to &quot;check out&quot; <br/>\ntoys, but we usually do this at toy stores, garage sales, and other <br/>\nkid&#39;s houses.  I don&#39;t keep things that don&#39;t get played with.  If <br/>\nthey play with their stuffed animals once a month for a long and fun <br/>\nplay time, then I&#39;d keep a basket of them in the top of the closet <br/>\nfor when they&#39;re ready for them.  But if they have a couple of <br/>\nstuffed animals that they just throw aside to get to other toys, I&#39;d <br/>\nget rid of them.  My friends and I love to have swap playdates, where <br/>\neveryone brings a bag of toys to trade.  Only having toys around that <br/>\nyour kids love really seems to help with the &quot;mess&quot;.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The bottom line is that you need to get creative to keep things <br/>\n </span></blockquote>tidy without all of the negative feelings and you have to practice <br/>\nmaking and enjoying messes with your children.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Best wishes!<br/>\n&gt; Jeanette<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----<br/>\n&gt; From: karend27 &lt;karend27@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 28, 2008 8:07:47 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Keeping your house tidy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt; First-time poster.

Got it off the web some where of what a child can do at what age.<br/>\nThis list empowers my children. My son loves the responsibility of taking<br/>\nout the trash when he has nothing better to do. My daughter loves helping<br/>\nmommy with laundry. Everyone picks up a stray sock when they see one.<br/>\nAlthough I haven&#39;t had to touch one in months because if I see one I am<br/>\nsupposed to tell my daughter so she can get it. She wants to help so much<br/>\nthat if someone else does it - she will melt down to the point that we have<br/>\nto undo it so she can do it.  My daughter who often makes a water mess in<br/>\nthe bathroom leaves it mostly dry and even cleans the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling for me means that we do what works for our family usually when I<br/>\nwrite here it is because I have tried everything else and it just isn&#39;t<br/>\nworking. We have the freedom to meet our needs. My kids do work but they<br/>\nhave the freedom to say no I am busy right now. Doing it the same time<br/>\neveryday is genius by the way - every one gets into the habit of doing it<br/>\ntogether at a set time. We are trying to get into a groove but right now<br/>\nwith the six month old and scattered bedtimes due to summer it has been hard<br/>\nto keep one going for very long. The kids just don&#39;t want to go to sleep!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n[mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Cori Belliveau<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 29, 2008 7:17 AM<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Keeping your house tidy<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids do chores. (I&#39;ve never posted here before because I have seen how<br/>\nquickly you attack people who post certain unlikeable ideas, so I&#39;m a bit<br/>\nscared to continue, but chores work for us.) I don&#39;t want the kids to grow<br/>\nup feeling like they have a free pass to destroy the place and follow their<br/>\nevery whim while I have to go behind them with a shovel and a spray<br/>\nbottle!! It doesn&#39;t take that long when we all help, and I tell them it&#39;s<br/>\npart of living with other people. I don&#39;t want to pick up my stinky old<br/>\nsocks any more than they do, but I do it as a courtesy to them to keep the<br/>\nhouse livable. They keep the toys and whatnot picked up as a courtesy to me<br/>\nfor cooking their food, driving them places, and a million other things they<br/>\nneed me for. They each have different chores (that they chose) and we do<br/>\nthem right after breakfast. I clean up at the same time so we&#39;re all in it<br/>\ntogether. I even ask the baby (16 mo) to carry her breakfast bowl to the<br/>\nkitchen. She loves it! The other two (6 and 4) aren&#39;t thrilled, but they<br/>\ndo appreciate the expediency of having a kitchen ready for that impromptu<br/>\nbaking experiment, or a dining room table cleared of crumbs and ready for<br/>\nplay dough, and the most important - knowing where their shoes are so they<br/>\ncan head for the woods.<br/>\nCori<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://coriandthegi &lt;http://coriandthegirls.livejournal.com&gt;<br/>\nrls.livejournal.com<br/>\n<br/>\nOn 7/28/08, A Perry &lt;ansperry@yahoo. &lt;mailto:ansperry%40yahoo.com&gt; com&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; hi,<br/>\n&gt; i also feel uncomfortable when the house gets really messy. it makes me<br/>\n&gt; feel confused more than anything, but i understand that crabby feeling.<br/>\n&gt; i think waiting until the end of the end of the day might be adding to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>your<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; crankiness. it&#39;s hard to clean up a whole lot of stuff after hours and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hours<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of playing. maybe try to put away the things everyone is really and truly<br/>\n&gt; done with when they finish with them. i usually clean up while my son has<br/>\n&gt; something to snack on. the mess is almost always in the living room and<br/>\n&gt; kitchen, so he&#39;s nearby and sometimes helps. my daughter does some of the<br/>\n&gt; cleaning, too, because i&#39;ve offered her money in exchange for some<br/>\n </span></blockquote>household<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; help. i imagine this is a loaded topic- the money for help thing- but it<br/>\n&gt; works. she gets a little spending money, i get a little help.<br/>\n&gt; we also keep things in the room where we use them, for the most part.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>there<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are toys in the living room in baskets, they are easy to just toss in when<br/>\n&gt; we finish with them. i used to prefer the toys in the other room but we<br/>\n&gt; never went into the living room until we put the fun stuff in there, and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; seemed to make clean up harder to put them in separate rooms.<br/>\n&gt; finally, if you feel seriously overwhelmed, you can either get rid of, or<br/>\n&gt; hide, some stuff. i have never been able to part with anything, but i have<br/>\n&gt; an enormous attic which i admit, is chaotic. i don&#39;t worry about that too<br/>\n&gt; much, because i remember as a child having a huge attic full of mysterious<br/>\n&gt; stuff, and it was wonderful. do you have a space where you can put some<br/>\n&gt; things that are not being used often? or you can circulate the toys,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>having<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; some stuff out for a month or so and then switching.<br/>\n&gt; i cleared out most of my own stuff to make room for the kids. i figure<br/>\n&gt; in five or so years, i&#39;ll wish i had legos and trains underfoot.<br/>\n&gt; angela<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- On Mon, 7/28/08, karend27 &lt;karend27@yaho a lot of tidying up all day<br/>\n&gt; long.<br/>\n&gt; From: karend27 &lt;karend27@yahoo. &lt;mailto:karend27%40yahoo.com&gt; com<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;karend27%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Keeping your house tidy<br/>\n&gt; To: unschoolingbasics@ &lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>yahoogroups.com&lt;unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Date: Monday, July 28, 2008, 8:07 PM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt; First-time poster. I was wondering what strategies any of you might<br/>\n&gt; like to pass on in terms of keeping your house tidy in your<br/>\n&gt; unschooling world. I have two boys - 5 and almost 3 - and I have to<br/>\n&gt; say the state of the house is really bugging me. We spend anywhere<br/>\n&gt; from 30 minutes to an hour every evening tidying up (I&#39;m not talking<br/>\n&gt; about cleaning, just picking up), and what happens a lot is I start<br/>\n&gt; snapping at the kids (which I really don&#39;t like, because I&#39;m normally<br/>\n&gt; pretty laid back and mellow), but it&#39;s usually just me putting<br/>\n&gt; everything away, while they move one block at a time using a tiny lego<br/>\n&gt; wheelbarrow to push it across the floor:)<br/>\n&gt; We only pick up once a day, but still, it&#39;s starting to really<br/>\n&gt; irritate me. I probably am a perfectionist in that I find I just feel<br/>\n&gt; a lot better and my mind feels clearer when I am not looking out on a<br/>\n&gt; lot of clutter (not to mention the injured feet after stepping on the<br/>\n&gt; umpteenth pointy block in the kitchen floor) Interested to know any<br/>\n&gt; strategies you all have either practical in terms of tidying, or<br/>\n&gt; mental (i.e., coping strategies for me).<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":319344940,"authorName":"Ginger and Jeff Sabo","from":"&quot;Ginger and Jeff Sabo&quot; &lt;thesabofamily@...&gt;","profile":"kaikade","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Keeping your house tidy","postDate":"1217344881","msgId":34892,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI1OTc2MzYxMDgwNzI5MDgyMWg1ODE3NTg3ZHA4OTdmNzI0YjdlN2VlMGQxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGE1NDFiMTk3MDgwNzI5MDQxN200MjQ4YjNmM25hMzhiMTU4Y2FhMGI0YjRjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc2bG4waitsa290QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDEzNDU5MS4xMTY2OC5xbUB3ZWIzMzIwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+CSA8YTU0MWIxOTcwODA3MjkwNDE3bTQyNDhiM2YzbmEzOGIxNThjYWEwYjRiNGNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34889,"nextInTopic":34893,"prevInTime":34891,"nextInTime":34893,"topicId":34868,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Tue, Jul 29, 2008 at 4:17 AM, Cori Belliveau  wrote: They keep the toys and whatnot picked up as a courtesy to me for cooking their","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1668819466\"><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">On Tue, Jul 29, 2008 at 4:17 AM, Cori Belliveau &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coribell@...\">coribell@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&quot;They keep the toys and whatnot picked up as a courtesy to me<br/>\nfor cooking their food, driving them places, and a million other things they<br/>\nneed me for.&quot;<br/>\nFirstly, I must say I&#39;m not attacking, I&#39;m discussing.  Please see it as<br/>\nsuch.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have my kids do chores.  They help me pick up when they wish to.  My<br/>\nyoungest will usually only do so if he sees I&#39;m doing it to enable our play<br/>\nto get bigger.  I don&#39;t require it.  I do ask for help sometimes and<br/>\nsometimes they help.  I also look at it as a skill they already have<br/>\nmastered and don&#39;t wish to practice right now (both boys know how to pick up<br/>\nand put things away) the same for dishes and laundry and dusting and<br/>\ncleaning.  I do acknowledge when they do something that is helpful (Kade<br/>\neven mopped the kitchen floor for me the other day all on his own<br/>\nvolition!).  I express my appreciation.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as to the quote.  My question is: what are you going to have to do &quot;as<br/>\na courtesy&quot; to them when they cook for you (or themselves for that matter),<br/>\ndrive for you and do the million things that you&#39;ve seen as &#39;needs from<br/>\nyou&#39;?  Do you keep tally with your Sig Other, too?  Is there a tally of who<br/>\ndoes what?  Should there be?  I personally say, no.  I try to make it as<br/>\nunconditional as I can.  That means I don&#39;t tally.  People show love in<br/>\ndifferent ways...and I am fortunate that I like to nurture (pick up after<br/>\nand feed).  However, all the others in my family have different ways of<br/>\nshowing their love.

However, when I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1830025927\">&quot;Keeping&quot; my house tidy just doesn&#39;t happen around here.  Nothing is all that consistent so that I have that perfect house all of the time.  However, when I really have a need for a clean and tidy house I can get pretty creative and I enjoy the creative process of planning how to do it.  I don&#39;t usually stick to one routine because it gets boring for me.  Here are a few suggestions that helped me:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  I need adrenaline or excitement to get into the mood for cleaning, etc.  Sometimes I plan to have someone over just to keep the excitement high, or I try to &quot;Surprise&quot; my husband with a really clean house, or I play cleaning games with the kids.  One of my kids (I have 3 and 5 yo boys and I&#39;m 34 weeks pregnant with another boy) really likes to play I spy.  I usually spy something wrong with a room and he puts everything back where it belongs.  Once everything is back where it belongs, I tell him what the secret item was and if he put it away.  Then he does the same thing in a room that I&#39;m cleaning.  My 3yo doesn&#39;t like to do it very much if his older brother is playing too because then he thinks that he lost.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  If I have a lot of house work to do and my kids are bored, I play while I&#39;m cleaning.  I turn into some character and the silliness begins.  We have pretended that our house is a hotel and we are getting ready for a king and queen to come visit.  I play the bossy head maid and my son loves to be the irresponsible janitor.  We have also made giant piles of laundry to jump in and throw around.  Then the kids usually sort it ALL for me.  My 3 yo loves to clean with me.  He has his own cleaning cart (a kid&#39;s shopping cart) complete with vinegar and water spray bottles, baking soda (for scrubbing), rags, dusters, trash bags tied on the sides, and a bucket and small mop.  He loves to wet his hands pour baking soda on them and scrub my shower.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  Another thing I like to do is make a BIGGER mess.  For example, if a room is really bugging me, I like to start from scratch and reorganize or rearrange.  My kids love this!  And my oldest asks for days if we can redo the house.  I recently emptied my entire pantry onto the kitchen table and putting it all back took all day, but then I had a really neat pantry.  The kids stayed busy checking out all of the food that they usually don&#39;t see and then they loved helping me decide how to organize it all back on the shelves.  My oldest helped me until the very end.<br/>\n<br/>\n4)  Another thing that plays into the adrenaline thing for me is to set a timer.  When the kids ask why I&#39;m moving so fast, I tell them and sometimes they want to get in on the fun.  I usually say something like:  I&#39;m trying to get this room picked up in 3 minutes.  <br/>\n<br/>\n5)  Baskets are great for a quick tidy.  I don&#39;t like to sort the baskets, but I just stick them in the guest room or closet and my husband doesn&#39;t mind doing some quick sorts once in a while.  My husband is much better at picking up and I&#39;m much better at deep cleaning so that&#39;s usually how things get done around here.<br/>\n<br/>\n6)  I am very comfortable in a mess and I think that helps to keep things low stress.  However, I think we all function better when things are much more tidy, so that&#39;s the way I try to keep things.<br/>\n<br/>\n7)  Try to think about how your kids play and how the &quot;mess&quot; is created.  For example, my boys love to play legos, but if they played with them all over the floor I&#39;d be picking them up for hours.  We use a play table (large train table with drawers under) for their legos.  This way they never have to pick them up.  It&#39;s an ongoing creative process.  Ask yourself &quot;What is making the mess?&quot;  &quot;How can I make things easier on myself?&quot;  Get creative.  My boys used to leave their dress up clothes all over the house until I created a special &quot;dressing room&quot; in one of our closets.  We have a family closet for all of our clothes, so that has freed up some other closets and those are great places to make &quot;messes&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n8)  Use more &quot;grown up&quot; things for play.  For example, we used to have all kinds of art supplies for the kids but they always wanted to use my husband&#39;s stuff.  We have gotten rid of all of the &quot;kid&quot; art stuff and have simplified our art supplies.  Another example of this is tools.  My 3yo loves tools.  He had a bunch of fake tools, but they would get scattered all over the house.  I have started helping him use adult tools instead and he has REALLY enjoyed this!  He likes to hammer nails into boxes or even wood.  <br/>\n<br/>\n9)  Consider the length of time that your kids stay interested in a toy.  Is it a toy that they just dig out, look at it for a second and throw it aside?  I think that it&#39;s important for kids to &quot;check out&quot; toys, but we usually do this at toy stores, garage sales, and other kid&#39;s houses.  I don&#39;t keep things that don&#39;t get played with.  If they play with their stuffed animals once a month for a long and fun play time, then I&#39;d keep a basket of them in the top of the closet for when they&#39;re ready for them.  But if they have a couple of stuffed animals that they just throw aside to get to other toys, I&#39;d get rid of them.  My friends and I love to have swap playdates, where everyone brings a bag of toys to trade.  Only having toys around that your kids love really seems to help with the &quot;mess&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is that you need to get creative to keep things tidy without all of the negative feelings and you have to practice making and enjoying messes with your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes!<br/>\nJeanette<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: karend27 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karend27@...\">karend27@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, July 28, 2008 8:07:47 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Keeping your house tidy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi everyone,<br/>\nFirst-time poster.

In my family, we don&#39;t <br/>\nhave assigned chores but my children&#39;s volunteering increases as they <br/>\nget older.  If I&#39;m cleaning and I feel like I need help, I ask if <br/>\nthey can help me.  Most of the time they are happy to do something.  <br/>\nBut they know that I completely respect their right to not help.  I <br/>\nlook at it as good role modeling.  I know I&#39;d be a very unhappy <br/>\nperson if my husband handed me a chore list and expected everything <br/>\nto be checked off.  I wouldn&#39;t feel like a valued family member.  I&#39;d <br/>\nfeel like an employee who isn&#39;t even getting paid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThings get easier as the children get older.

I&#39;m venturing out of lurkdom because I could <br/>\nhave written your post myself -- a few months ago, before this unschooling <br/>\njourney we started.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a 5 and (almost) 3 yo, both boys. So I can relate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the first thing to do is take a big, deep, breath, let it out, and <br/>\nrelax. I can feel the tension through the words in your post. I know <br/>\n*exactly* what you mean when you say the mess drives you crazy, but it&#39;s <br/>\nonly stuff: Start trying to let go of that need to have it all tidy and neat <br/>\nas a button. Remember what the toys all over the place represent: Your boys <br/>\ngrowing, loving life, learning, playing with each other, finding value in <br/>\nall the big and small parts of this great world, being HAPPY!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd slowly, consciously change the little voice in your head: When you see <br/>\nthe mess, think &quot;This is the outcome of a wonderful, positive, loving day <br/>\nthat my boys and I (and whoever else) shared together! I am so greatful for <br/>\nthis wonderful mess! In fact, I LOVE it! I embrace it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when you do clean toys up, realize it&#39;s because *you* don&#39;t like the <br/>\n&quot;mess&quot; (what I prefer to call creative output) -- not because they don&#39;t <br/>\nlike it. You are cleaning it up for your *own* sake. So don&#39;t expect them to <br/>\nnaturally want to do it. And if they want to put one Lego away at a time - <br/>\nremember, that is what makes sense to them. That is what is bringing them <br/>\njoy in tidying up. What if someone thought *your* method of putting toys <br/>\naway was inefficient and useless? Would that be a positive experience for <br/>\nyou, and would it make you want to tidy up all the time?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, here&#39;s another though: Many of us are programmed to think <br/>\n&quot;Cleaning up is such a chore!&quot; But really - isn&#39;t is sometimes fun? Kind of <br/>\nlike playing house when you were a kid? I dig into that inner child of mine <br/>\nwhenever possible when I&#39;m doing housework. I haven&#39;t solved the riddle of <br/>\ngetting the whole house cleaned up at one time (usually sections here and <br/>\nthere..), and I still dream (sometimes out loud!) of the perfect &quot;system&quot; <br/>\nthat joyfully keeps all the stuff (and laundry and groceries) flowing and in <br/>\norder (sort of), but I keep it all in perspective. It&#39;s only stuff; and I am <br/>\na better person when I rise above my &quot;need for organization&quot; and can let go.<br/>\n<br/>\n(There&#39;s a great Dayna Martin video on this - it&#39;s where I got many of these <br/>\nideas from: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr7U7wXmBcA)\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr7U7wXmBcA)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps and makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ariana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;karend27&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karend27@...\">karend27@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 28, 2008 8:07 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Keeping your house tidy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt; First-time poster.
