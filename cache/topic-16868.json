I know my children whine as an expression of frustration (well. . those could be tantrums ;-) ), hunger, fatigue, etc.  For instance, when we&#39;ve been at the water park since 11 (when they open) and they close at 5 and we need to leave, all three of them will whine and complain.  They are 1. tired. 2. they don&#39;t want the fun to end and 3. maybe hungry (too busy playing to get enough of the snacks we brought).  I think knowing it is an expression of an emotion shouldn&#39;t illicit negative reactions and negative emotions from *us*.  Reflecting their feelings, agreeing (&quot;Yes, baby, I don&#39;t want to leave either!  This was really fun!&quot;) and being there helps.

Let them SEE and HEAR you work out this<br/>\nissue.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree!!  It&#39;s so weird to think about hiding away to come to some<br/>\nagreement first. I think if the parents are yelling and being angry,<br/>\nmaybe wait and don&#39;t discuss it then. But I can remember many times<br/>\nwhen dh would say something really limiting and I&#39;d just look at him<br/>\nand say &quot;What is the big deal if he wants more ice cream?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUsual answer would be &quot;well, he&#39;s had a lot of ice cream and he hasn&#39;t<br/>\neaten anything healthy&quot; to which I would reply &quot;So what you&#39;re really<br/>\nworried about is that he gets healthy food? Why don&#39;t you fix him<br/>\nsomething yummy and healthy then?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThat usually ended conversation, as dh is not much of a cook!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids know I will stand up for them. I&#39;m their ally and they trust<br/>\nme. I had to be their ally with their Dad too....now he is just as<br/>\nlikely to catch me saying something stupid as I am him. It&#39;s cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16955,"nextTopicId":16949}}
