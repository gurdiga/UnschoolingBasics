I am also not required to be on campus for more than fifteen hours (tops) on any given week and so there is quite a bit of wiggle room.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the last academic year (mine, not his!), our schedule was like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonday - Art & Music work with his favorite teacher, 3 hours with his babysitter when I teach alternate monday nights. <br/>\nAlternate Tuesday nights - babysitter<br/>\nWednesday AM - babysitter (my office hours)<br/>\nThursday 1 - 2.30 pm (Open swim with homeschooling families followed by gymtime) followed by lunch at our favorite place and shopping at the co-op<br/>\nFriday - 3 - 4. 30 pm (Chess/Drama club with homeschooling families followed by gym time)<br/>\nFriday evening or Saturday AM - Library visit<br/>\nSunday - Tennis/playdate with schooled friends<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if the structure helped him (as in reducing anxiety,<br/>\nproviding stability), but it helps me to get out of the house. I could<br/>\nhappily spend days without getting out of the house and as the sole<br/>\ncompanion to a single child, it would be easy (for me) to get into a rut of<br/>\nscreen time, books and board games in front of the fireplace, but my son is<br/>\nreally physical and social and so active time with other kids was really helpful. So, although we went skiing, sledding, and snowshoeing a lot, gym and swim time with other kids was a lifesaver in our &#39;really long&#39; winter. He is also not fond of group classes and so the open swim gave him a context to hang out with other kids and swim rather than be in a structured class setting. We also built a sled hill in our backyard this year, so we could play outside a little bit every day even if we didn&#39;t feel like hitting the trails.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not yet sure about how this summer is going to transpire for us. We arrived in India early this week and will be here all summer. It is really hot during the day so that precludes us from doing outdoorsy stuff. So far he has sleeping his jetlag off and riding his bike that his grandparents bought for him and watching TV. We will probably go to the beach in the evenings and travel a bit, but other than that, everything is up for grabs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nLatha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Tue, 5/5/09, Zoa Conner &lt;zoaconner@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\nFrom: Zoa Conner &lt;zoaconner@...&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Kids who benefit from structure - what kind?<br/>\nTo: &quot;unschoolingbasics&quot; &lt;unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, May 5, 2009, 9:59 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n      I know some of you have kids who flourish more with some<br/>\n<br/>\namount of structure.
