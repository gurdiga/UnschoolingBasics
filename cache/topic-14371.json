His parents came here with his grandparents when they<br/>\nwere newly married.  My dad went back to Iceland to visit about 20<br/>\nyears ago and &quot;met the cousins.&quot;  Everyone knew his lineage as soon as<br/>\nhe would say that his grandfather was Sigurd Geisleifurson.  Oh, well,<br/>\nSigurd was married to Alfhid and her father was .......&quot; and it would<br/>\ngo on all night.  My dad&#39;s family is Icelandic back to when Eric and<br/>\nLeifur were exploring it!  People there know their lineage.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn my mother&#39;s side, I know about the American part of her father&#39;s<br/>\nside because one of the cousins wrote a book.  Being the<br/>\nAmericancentric jerk that he is he didn&#39;t feel that anything prior to<br/>\ntheir arrival to America in the late 1700&#39;s was important.  So not<br/>\nimportant he doesn&#39;t even mention where they came from!   On her<br/>\nmother&#39;s side that also is fairly easy as my greatgrandmoter was 100%<br/>\nCherokee.  She was the first in her family to marry a European.  And<br/>\nmy grandfather was a Weaver and his father was from Scotland.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] surnames, languages, etc...","postDate":"1150033938","msgId":14372,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVDN0U4MjVCLTZFQTItNDFENC1BMkZGLUU3NjQzMDI5MjY1NEBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTExNS1EQVY0RDg3OUVCRUMwQTAzRUMzRUMxOUNEMzhFMEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTEwMi1GNEQwOTBDRjhERUM1MDM1OUEzQUM5QjA4ODBAcGh4LmdibD4gPEJBWTExNS1EQVY0RDg3OUVCRUMwQTAzRUMzRUMxOUNEMzhFMEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":14371,"nextInTopic":14387,"prevInTime":14371,"nextInTime":14373,"topicId":14371,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My dad did....relatively easy since he s only third generation, he went back to about 1750.
