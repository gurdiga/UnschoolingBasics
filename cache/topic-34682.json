I think I forgot to mention a<br/>\nfew things, like that the plans are often malicious toward the younger<br/>\nkids around, and that he is generally sort of a bossy bull frog toward<br/>\nthe younger ones, and is sometimes downright bullyish. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have put some thought into the jealousy issue, and I think that,<br/>\nyes, that may be a part of it, because I don&#39;t really have a great<br/>\nrelationship with him. Mainly it&#39;s because I find it hard to be<br/>\nfriends with a person of any age that is cruel to young children and<br/>\nmanipulative across the board. I just have a really hard time handling<br/>\na situation in which there is a person that does not come to adults<br/>\nfor help, treat us as though we were his equals, as we treat him,  but<br/>\nrather, lies and sneaks so often that I find it hard to believe he is<br/>\nbeing honest at all. And, so, we go out and do things as a family, and<br/>\nhe comes along, and before I know it they&#39;re off whispering, and then<br/>\nsuddenly a younger kid is crying with a mudpie in the face. Or, an<br/>\niceball filled with rocks is being hurled at a car that&#39;s driving past<br/>\nand I&#39;m RIGHT THERE and it doesn&#39;t even matter. <br/>\n<br/>\n I lived with this family for a year, and no matter how much I said<br/>\n&quot;yes&quot; and played with them, and modeled the behavior of truthfulness,<br/>\nworking together, respecting other folks right to just *be* He just<br/>\nhas some issues with trusting adults, and, geez, how much can you<br/>\naffect another person&#39;s behavior, and when is it time to just call it<br/>\nquits? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that one of my most major issues here is that in our family,<br/>\nwe have principles, not rules, that guide us. Kindness, patience,<br/>\ngentleness, in our dealings with others. If a child is super<br/>\nfrustrated and just melting down, yelling at me and freaking out, I am<br/>\ngoing to calmly ask, can we talk about this when you don&#39;t feel like<br/>\nyelling anymore? I don&#39;t like to be yelled at. At their house, they<br/>\nmight just have a conversation screaming at the top of their lungs at<br/>\neachother, using mean and angry words. I think that with our maybe<br/>\nadmittedly idealistic lifestyle, I am just a bit sensitive to this. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to be screamed at, or manipulated, or lied to, and I know<br/>\nthat it may be impossible for a child who does not have a model of<br/>\npeacefulness in his own home to be a peaceful person, but do I really<br/>\nhave to deal with it? There&#39;s always some decompression time after<br/>\nthey play together, during which we discuss Solly&#39;s behavior, not his,<br/>\nand there&#39;s almost always a total communication breakdown for awhile,<br/>\nwhere Solstice acts like I&#39;m the big bad enemy. It just sucks. <br/>\n <br/>\nEspecially because I endeavor always to find a way around &quot;no&quot;. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to say it, I want to find a way to do the things they want<br/>\nto do. But, if they&#39;re running across the street to jump off of the<br/>\ndumpsters in the parking lot, and I say no, no matter what else I<br/>\nsuggest, I&#39;m just the evil adult. It&#39;s ridiculous, because I KNOW that<br/>\nsometimes the whatever it is that they want to do is not even a real<br/>\ndesire, but just a manipulation tactic to show my kids, &quot;see, I told<br/>\nyou she&#39;d say no.&quot; I&#39;ve heard him say it a million times. Well, you<br/>\nknow what, kids, no, you cannot burn the house down. No, you cannot<br/>\nlock the 5 year old in the closet on a hot day and then go outside.<br/>\nWhat the heck!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(all of this actually happened except for them trying to burn the<br/>\nhouse down. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Natalie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":316155691,"authorName":"Lori Denley","from":"Lori Denley &lt;loridenley@...&gt;","profile":"loridenley","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: kids and secrecy","postDate":"1216606029","msgId":34697,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc3MTE4Ni42ODM3Ni5xbUB3ZWI0NTIxNi5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGc2MGt1aCtibmNvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34688,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":34696,"nextInTime":34698,"topicId":34682,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe y all could set up some kind of adventure for the kids that they could do on their own, like a scavenger or treasure hunt maybe?    Lori ...

My ten year old son, Solstice, has a friend, well, his best friend, actually, that has some","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1993332984\">Hi folks, <br/>\nI have an ongoing situation I need a little input on. My ten year old<br/>\nson, Solstice, has a friend, well, his best friend, actually, that has<br/>\nsome tendencies to sneak around, and basically try to &quot;get away&quot; with<br/>\nstuff. When he and Solly get together, or talk on the phone, they<br/>\npretty much always have some sort of secret thing they&#39;re<br/>\nplanning,(which I normally would be fine with, in respecting my<br/>\nSolly&#39;s right to his privacy and independence) but over the past year,<br/>\nthe things they are coming up with are increasingly ill advised and<br/>\ndangerous. In December, the midst of a freezing Wisconsin winter, they<br/>\n&quot;ran away&quot; together, at 10 pm, without enough warm stuff on, or a<br/>\ndestination. This is the only friend there is ever any sneakiness<br/>\nwith, Solly&#39;s general policy is full disclosure, to a fault!  :)<br/>\nThis is puzzling to me for two reasons. Number one is my relationship<br/>\nwith my son. He has high functioning Asperger&#39;s, and I have always<br/>\nbeen his &quot;contact&quot; person, (or his &quot;advocate&quot; as they call it in the<br/>\npublic school system) and so he tends to choose to come to me with<br/>\nwhatever idea or plans he has and run them by me first. He knows that<br/>\nI will help him to work towards whatever his goal is, without<br/>\ntrivializing his desires.(I know this because he does come to me with<br/>\n lots and lots of stuff.) <br/>\n He does have a great deal of independence, and usually prepares most<br/>\nof his own food, uses his paints, clay, and other things that the<br/>\nyounger kids usually ask first about because he knows that he can do<br/>\nthese things on his own, and that they are things he feels confident<br/>\nthat I won&#39;t ask him to wait awhile, or do it differently (please take<br/>\nthe clay off of the couch and put it on a hard surface.) like I<br/>\nfrequently need to do with the younger kids. He will even ask<br/>\n&#39;permission&#39; to use a swear word! (totally his idea, and, again, he is<br/>\nlooking more for guidance than permission) I have assumed that maybe<br/>\nhe is trying to branch out and gain some further independence with<br/>\nmaking his own choices, but I also think that this other young man<br/>\nencourages him to hide things and to disregard the general policy of<br/>\nour household, which is to democratically decide things like when we<br/>\nhave friends over, what we are doing on the weekends, etc. Things<br/>\nchange a great deal in the way that Solly relates to others when this<br/>\nfriend is around.<br/>\nReason number two this is confusing, is that this other boy is also an<br/>\nunschooler, and his mother also is very open in her communications<br/>\nwith him, and facilitating his needs and wants. So, it is puzzling to<br/>\nme that he would have such a draw to secret plans and hiding things.<br/>\n(not that this couldn&#39;t be a parental issue) <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m holding my Solly back, or saying *no* too much,<br/>\nbut I guess I should probably ask him what he thinks about being<br/>\nsecretive. He has already told me that he doesn&#39;t feel like he sees<br/>\nthis friend enough, and I know that is because over the course of the<br/>\nlast year, I have really grown to mistrust this boy, his judgment, and<br/>\nhis motivations, and therefore I do find excuses not to have him<br/>\naround, which is probably only aggravating the situation. However,<br/>\nthis was all happening when we were roommates with this boy and his<br/>\nmother, over the course of a year, and it has only been since April<br/>\nthat we haven&#39;t lived with them. <br/>\nI guess I am just wondering about secrecy and kids in general. Is this<br/>\njust a natural part of feeling like they are &quot;master of their own<br/>\ndestiny&quot;-just branching out? How would you handle this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n-Natalie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34677,"nextTopicId":34663}}
