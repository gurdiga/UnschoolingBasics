(He had <br/>\ntold me after he left school that he would never read anything again! <br/>\n&lt;g&gt; He&#39;s now reading several books at the same time.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, Duncan was incredulous! Why would *anyone* NOT want to read?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s the reason *I* don&#39;t worry. I have one child that <br/>\nfinally is reading again for pleasure. I have another who was never <br/>\npressured, who learned in his own time, and who loves to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would rather have children who like to read than children who can, <br/>\nbut avoid it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeep breaths!

I can&#39;t say don&#39;t worry cos you will but as the process of life unfolds you will see how your dd progresses in her way and you will feel better.  My boys have little interest in reading and writing. They love being read to tho and they enjoy drawing and writing small bits and pieces if it is relevant to them - eg one is into Harry Potter so writes his name on everything. I think schooled chilren have the process of reading and writing forced on them when many are not ready and that cannot be helpful to them as they get older.  Remember we have an easy ride here with our laws on home education.  The law is clear that HE children do not have to be at school based standards.  I have recently had a battle over this with our LEA and won. They backed off after saying they wanted to test my twins and I refused to let them.  You dd is getting a childhood and playing is vital to learning. My 15 year old still plays but he has also learnt to read and write somewhere along the way lol. (Also do maths I can&#39;t understand!!!). So try to relax.<br/>\nRuth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Reading and Writing","postDate":"1119013414","msgId":5637,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5ZC4zNjAxNjA5ZC4yZmU0MjQyNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5635,"nextInTopic":5638,"prevInTime":5636,"nextInTime":5638,"topicId":5635,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/17/2005 8:51:37 AM Eastern Standard Time, unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com writes: We read  books every day together, but there has been","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-676532320\">In a message dated 6/17/2005 8:51:37 AM Eastern Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe read  books every day together, but there has been no sign that she <br/>\nwants to  read them herself.
