There&#39;s also one<br/>\nfor the Tri-Cities just East of you a bit further. I don&#39;t remember<br/>\nseeing  you there, but I don&#39;t always remember names on lists very well!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have this goal to turn the Tri-Cities area into an unschooling RICH<br/>\nplace.  I just found out last night that an RU family relocating from<br/>\nNew Orleans is moving here. Once they get settled, there&#39;s the chance<br/>\nthat 1-2 other unschooling families from their area will come.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m working on my sis and another friend from P&#39;cola that say they&#39;re<br/>\ncoming as soon as possible! AND another friend that used to live in<br/>\nP&#39;cola and is in SC right now is thinking about this area.<br/>\nSo......it&#39;s happening!! Tri-Cities TN is the place to be folks.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9850,"nextTopicId":9877}}
