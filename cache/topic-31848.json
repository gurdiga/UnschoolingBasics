So do you only stay at the campground till the end of April?  I just joined the FOTR group and before we left we sold all of our camping gear so for now I&#39;m thinking we aren&#39;t going to be staying in any campgrounds for a while...I&#39;m not familiar but I think some RV cgrounds do have designated tent areas.  I guess my main concern about RVing it is how do we get and stay connected to the Internet (without spending fortune) and with my husband having to go to the mall to work everyday how often would we find a campground that is really close to a larger town where the malls are located??  Lots of things to consider for us before making that big purchase I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were just up to me I&#39;d love to own a campground but his dream is to have a resort.

(heart <br/>\nwrenching) we wanted to get a feel for this life before we tried to <br/>\nbring him with us.  Unfortunately most of the corporate housing units <br/>\nare not animal friendly. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I have had a few moments of anxiety with just trying <br/>\nto get used to the dynamics of this new life style.  <br/>\nIt really is a challenge, but keeping an open mind and an attitude <br/>\nof &quot;this is an adventure&quot; and &quot;a means to accomplishing our goals&quot;  <br/>\nwill be key to making this whole life changing decision an exciting <br/>\nexperience.<br/>\nOur family goal is to build or purchase a resort in Puerto Rico to <br/>\nrun as a family with in the next few years. So by keeping  that goal <br/>\nin the fore front as well as enjoying all of new terrain and visiting <br/>\nas many attractions in each new location..it will be a wonderful life <br/>\nexperience for the three of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.

We are waiting for <br/>\nour house to sell, and then we will hit the road.  We had talked <br/>\nabout it on and off for the past year and finally decided it was <br/>\ntime to act instead of just wishing.  We have three children, two <br/>\ncats, two guinea pigs and a bunny...all going along...<br/>\nWhen we first approached the kids with the idea, it was just that, <br/>\nan idea.  We did not decide to do it until everyone was on board <br/>\nwith what we would be doing.  It was a process for us all.  <br/>\nUltimately, we asked the kids if they would like to do something <br/>\nlike this, and then asked what we could do to make it as &quot;normal&quot; as <br/>\npossible for them...well...normal to us!!!  They had many ideas, <br/>\nlike helping to pick where we go, laptops and webcams to keep in <br/>\ntouch with friends, helping to decide what we &quot;really&quot; needed in a <br/>\nmotorhome, etc...the hardest part for them has been getting rid of <br/>\nall of our things.  While I am finding it completely freeing, they <br/>\nare requiring more time, and if needed i will arrange for storage if <br/>\nthey feel they cannot part with something, or even everthing.  They <br/>\nare excited most days, but there is still a day once in a while when <br/>\nthey say they don&#39;t want to go...then the next day they are <br/>\nplanning some adventure on the other side of the world for us!  I <br/>\nthink the important thing is to talk, talk, and talk some more, so <br/>\neveryone feels that their ideas, concerns, fears, and wishes are <br/>\nvalid and being heard.

If we unschool and DH works <br/>\nfrom the computer, then why NOT travel?  We cannot afford to keep up <br/>\nour house though and horses AND travel extensively.  That is why the <br/>\nthought of just going all out, and getting out.  Something in me sees <br/>\nthe &quot;typical&quot; lifestyle so draining anyway, but I realize that RVing <br/>\nfull time has its own set of demands.  We have done it for vacations <br/>\nbefore, so we are aware of that!  I am more concerned with the lack of <br/>\nhome--aspects on the kids, the tight quarters, and again, the lack of <br/>\na A home.  Of course home is where the family is, but is that really <br/>\nhow the kids feel?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKelley</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31842,"nextTopicId":31851}}
