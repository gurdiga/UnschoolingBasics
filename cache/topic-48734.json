Can you plan day trips and even overnights? Are there any groups of homeschoolers you can connect with so you have people to visit? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s pretty extreme to uproot people from their community and established friendships - and cities aren&#39;t necessarily welcoming places. If your kids have a comfortable social group to move To, then they might feel better about visiting older friends in the country on weekends.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":87646156,"authorName":"joanne morehouse","from":"&quot;joanne morehouse&quot; &lt;joanne.morehouse@...&gt;","profile":"joannemorehouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"moving?","postDate":"1341809836","msgId":48734,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp0ZG9iYythcXNrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48736,"prevInTime":48733,"nextInTime":48735,"topicId":48734,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi group I have a question for you all.

My husband and I live in a semi-rural area outside a major city center-more of a bedroom community. Two of my kids are learning at home and one is in high school. I would like to move closer to the city so the kids can have more access to culture and activities that they can&#39;t find where we live. My dilemma is that my son who is in school really doesn&#39;t want to move and either does my daughter as all her friends live in the neighbourhood (all schooled). My other son would like to move closer to the city. It&#39;s quite a difficult decision to make and any alternative view points would be welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48725,"nextTopicId":48738}}
