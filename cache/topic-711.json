He&#39;s now growing out of this, it seems, and is <br/>\nopen to hanging out with kids and even approaching some at parks and at <br/>\nJeepers (like Chuck E Cheese).

He isn&#39;t complaining about not having <br/>\nmore friends, is he?  This is normal for HIM and he&#39;ll out grow it -- <br/>\nor not -- but you can&#39;t force him to change who he is.

Mary Sheedy Kurcinka&#39;s book &quot;The<br/>\nSpirited Child&quot; talks a lot about introvert / extrovert and that was the<br/>\nbook that finally changed my thinking around to accepting and celebrating<br/>\nthe extreme introvert that my child is.  I think it is doubly hard because<br/>\nit is my belief that it is our cultural norm here in the US anyway to value<br/>\nand celebrate extroverts - they are the ones who &quot;get things done&quot; the &quot;go<br/>\ngetters&quot; etcetera.  I think the contributions and skills of introverts are<br/>\nvastly undervalued and that affects all of our thinking.  I myself used to<br/>\nfeel I was just &quot;stuck&quot; with being an introvert - it would be so much better<br/>\nto be extroverted.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading Mary&#39;s book, I stopped trying to &quot;get&quot; my daughter into social<br/>\nsituations I wanted her to handle, or to particularly value that, and I<br/>\nstarted to notice and nurture the ways in which she feels comfortable<br/>\nmeeting others (small groups actually one on one or one on two is best; at<br/>\nour house is best for a while and almost a must the first time).  My<br/>\ndaughter loves playing with other kids she likes (and she certainly doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlike or have to like them all) in an environment that feels safe to her and<br/>\nwhat I think I understand now about her personality is that what affects her<br/>\nsafety level is her exteme sensitivity to others.  This is a wonderful<br/>\ngift - I&#39;ve seen her comfort other kids, she cares so much about their<br/>\nfeelings.  She is also very sensitive to the safety of others in a situation<br/>\nand how that makes her feel - rough play among other kids in a close<br/>\nenvironment will make her feel unsafe for instance even if it is not<br/>\ndirected at her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I do not believe there is anything wrong with your daughter, possibly<br/>\njust something faulty with our own culturally ingrained values and<br/>\nexpectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kate Sitzman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kate@...\">kate@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 16, 2004 4:02 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] How Much Socializing was Enjoying<br/>\nChildren /Intense Reaction to TV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;How do you (the collective &quot;you&quot; of the list) tell, or estimate, or what<br/>\n&gt;&gt;leads you to believe, that your kids &quot;need&quot; to socialize more?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sorry to answer a question with a question, but &quot;socialization&quot; has been a<br/>\nbit of an issue around here for me lately, and I wanted to throw this out<br/>\nthere. My son turns 4 this week, and he just does not function very well in<br/>\nsocial situations - he completely shuts down around unfamiliar kids, and is<br/>\nawkward and stressed even around those he knows well. At home or among close<br/>\nrelatives he is relaxed, talkative and charming. He doesn&#39;t like to go out<br/>\nmuch and prefers to stay home most days. My dilemma is that I really don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how to tell if this is just a normal personality variation that I just<br/>\nneed to accept, or a deeper problem that needs working on. It seems like he<br/>\nwould like to reach out to kids more often, and would like to be more at<br/>\nease with them, so in that sense it creates a problem, but is it serious<br/>\nenough to require a more concerted effort? Therapy? How do I know? The<br/>\nongoing dilemma for me is that I honestly don&#39;t know if he needs me to limit<br/>\nsocial situations at this point or if he needs me to give him more<br/>\nopportunities in which to improve his skills. I would love to know how<br/>\npeople make these decisions.

My son turns 4 this week, and he just does not function very well<br/>\nin<br/>\n  social situations - he completely shuts down around unfamiliar kids, and<br/>\nis<br/>\n  awkward and stressed even around those he knows well. At home or among<br/>\nclose<br/>\n  relatives he is relaxed, talkative and charming. He doesn&#39;t like to go out<br/>\n  much and prefers to stay home most days. My dilemma is that I really don&#39;t<br/>\n  know how to tell if this is just a normal personality variation that I<br/>\njust<br/>\n  need to accept, or a deeper problem that needs working on. It seems like<br/>\nhe<br/>\n  would like to reach out to kids more often, and would like to be more at<br/>\n  ease with them, so in that sense it creates a problem, but is it serious<br/>\n  enough to require a more concerted effort? Therapy? How do I know? The<br/>\n  ongoing dilemma for me is that I honestly don&#39;t know if he needs me to<br/>\nlimit<br/>\n  social situations at this point or if he needs me to give him more<br/>\n  opportunities in which to improve his skills. I would love to know how<br/>\n  people make these decisions.

That way we can be in the same room and he feels<br/>\nconnected to me while I get some personal time.  Also, it prevents him vying<br/>\nwith me for time on the computer which used to create conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\n* I try to find some quiet time to be just with him (usually while our 1.5yo<br/>\nnaps or plays with my dh) which helps us  when I need some non-interactive<br/>\ntime later. I&#39;ve already given him some focused time and he is more patient<br/>\nwith the time I want for myself or when I want to be in the same room but<br/>\ndoing a different activity.<br/>\n<br/>\n*He has a playspace in the house that is a place he can go alone, and other<br/>\npeople come in by invitation only.  I never thought he would want to play<br/>\nalone, but I think the lack of distraction and the ability to set up his<br/>\nplay as he chooses and leave it up as long as he wants helps him to get<br/>\ninvolved deeply which gives me some stretches of time to renew my energy.<br/>\nAlso he is experiencing that one way people get renewal is by having some<br/>\ntime alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel<br/>\nwww.DiaperFreeBaby.org</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":72521049,"authorName":"Wendy E","from":"&quot;Wendy E&quot; &lt;mommytoluc@...&gt;","profile":"mommytoluc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Enjoying Children","postDate":"1087282791","msgId":714,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNhbTZwNyt0NHJ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNhbHBsayszdGczQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":713,"nextInTopic":717,"prevInTime":713,"nextInTime":715,"topicId":711,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We seem to have a challenging 5yo theme going here (and not just the challenging boys, it seems).

And, yes I have had days<br/>\nwhen I have been thankful when his precious little head hit the pillow and<br/>\nsnoring sounds came out.<br/>\n      I don&#39;t know if you tried martial arts, but for Keegan it really<br/>\nseemed to pull something out of it.  He needed the focus and ability to see<br/>\nsomeone letting off steam, but not directly hurting someone.  Initially I<br/>\nthought; Yeah right teach him how to really hurt someone, but was I wrong.<br/>\nI think all the focus on being courteous and having self control is starting<br/>\nto sink in.<br/>\n     I don&#39;t know if this is the case for your daughter, but for Keegan I<br/>\nlove that his personality is constant.  No matter where he goes or who he is<br/>\nwith his emotions are raw and out there.  The other kids in his martial arts<br/>\nclass are wearing masks while their there.  They are all composed and<br/>\nthoughtful during class and then when they get outside they are crying,<br/>\nwhining and carrying on to their moms and dads.  With Keegan you get what<br/>\nyou see and I just love that.<br/>\n    It also helped to look at things a little differently in my case.  I<br/>\nneeded to stop seeing the negative Keegan and start seeing the positive<br/>\nthings he did.  That isn&#39;t as easy as it sounds when you thought that you<br/>\nwere in a constant battle with a five year old.  When I woke up and saw that<br/>\nwhen he wasn&#39;t tormenting someone or needing to wear his clothes just right<br/>\netc.. he had extreme happy moments.  You gotta love that!!<br/>\n    I don&#39;t know if I helped at all, but atleast you know you are not the<br/>\nonly one out there with a child that just takes a little more energy than<br/>\nthe rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnMarie<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: melissazietlow [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Zietlowfamily@...\">Zietlowfamily@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Monday, June 14, 2004 11:16 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Enjoying Children<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hello All,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just wondering if anyone else has been at a point with a child when<br/>\n  it has become very difficult to enjoy their company?
