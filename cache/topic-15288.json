Bread is good, you can&#39;t rush it, kneeding and feeling the dough transform is wonderfully theraputic. Working chocolate is good too, it&#39;s soothing to melt and swirl and it smells sooooo good.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Screaming/yelling has worked. We&#39;ll have yelling contests, the boys started this when they need to release and I&#39;ve found that it can work wonders.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Watching moves that make me cry. Sometimes when things are overwhelming and I&#39;ve had to hold it together and I just can&#39;t anymore I put on a movie that I KNOW will make me cry and I have at it.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hope some of this helped...<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ~Rebecca<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny transition serious enough to alter your definition of self will require not just small adjustments in your way of living and thinking but a full-on metamorphosis   ~Martha Beck~<br/>\n   <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:3boysleadtheway@...\">3boysleadtheway@...</a><br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nTalk is cheap.
