I have been lurking for a  <br/>\nwhile and enjoy the discussions.  I am a mom with 3 yo twins living  <br/>\naway from family with my partner.  I am very interested in  <br/>\nunschooling and thought my kids were &quot;too young&quot; to start thinking  <br/>\nabout &quot;education&quot;.  The more I read, the better I understand that the  <br/>\nlearning is happening here and now.  One of the ideas I am most  <br/>\nattracted to is allowing children to create their own path.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat brings me to my question.  I never went for letting my kids cry- <br/>\nit-out to get to sleep.  Because of sleep deprivation and lack of  <br/>\nextra help, I am in the position where my kids won&#39;t sleep unless one  <br/>\nof us is in the room laying down with them.  Some times this is fine  <br/>\nbut more often it feels like a burden these days.  I truly want my  <br/>\nkids to learn how to sleep on their own without trauma.  Today after  <br/>\nreading a post I realized forcing them into my idea of their sleep  <br/>\nschedule was creating discomfort for all of us.  I want to let them  <br/>\ndevelop their own routine around sleep and learn to ask to go to  <br/>\nsleep when they are ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be great if anyone who has been in this position could offer  <br/>\nsome advice.  My partner is not too keen on the idea.  Feeling it  <br/>\nwould be too loosy-goosey and permissive (we definitely fall on  <br/>\ndifferent parts of the spectrum around their role in decision  <br/>\nmaking).  We need to be on the same page about this as we both  <br/>\nparticipate in the night time routine.  I would love to have some  <br/>\nanecdotal evidence to share to bring us closer together on this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for all your support<br/>\nTheresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45068,"nextTopicId":45081}}
