It has created a variety of dynamics for our kids. They are getting exposure to other cultures but at the same time across the lines of ethnicity you have people who play nicely and those who just don&#39;t. It has taken a bit for our kids to find ones that play they play nicely together they have even started their own club &quot;The Club for Nice People&quot;. They have been trying to find a safe place for a club house. Well since my daughter&#39;s new best friend lives almost directly behind us, there is an empty trailer lot and a fence in between and the other mother isn&#39;t as involved with her children playing outside, she does have a very new baby to take care of and the weather has been icky. We decided that since we are turning out little lot into an edible landscape we are going to set aside one area with a lattice arbor and let the kids help us plant and create their own club house. The parents are all thrilled to<br/>\n death and materials are being donated. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had similar problems with some of the kids in the neighborhood, however, I have noticed that when I am outside, not necessarily playing with the kids but working on building our gardens, cleaning the car and restocking it, etc they seem to behave better. I think it is more or less an escape from dominating parents but if there is an authority figure around they seem to mind their manners. I do try to include them if they are near by when we pass out juice boxes or water bottles or some kind of snack. This is probably how our house becomes a haven to other kids. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course a few of the families are a bit taken back by the fact we homeschool. I haven&#39;t even attempted to explain unschooling to them it would just confuse them as they are having a hard time understanding why we don&#39;t take advantage of the school system and give ourselves a break from having the kids with us constantly. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I definitely promote the idea of creating a safe haven on your own turf. Most kids that bully are bullied themselves at home. Perhaps if this girl sees that not all parents are like that, it might help her to make better decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/\">http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/\">http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Meredith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meredith@...\">meredith@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, March 2, 2009 10:54:30 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: advice re child who plays with my children plz...slightly ot, but im worried<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;ann329851&quot; <br/>\n&lt;annworsley991@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;now, i dont <br/>\n&gt; want to level myself to the psych of a 14 yr old, but im becoming <br/>\n&gt; increasingly worried, that shes dominating and  controlling <br/>\n </span></blockquote>children <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; much much younger than herself. if im truthful, im quite angry she <br/>\n&gt; bullied mine too. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Its entirely possible that&#39;s what&#39;s going on.
