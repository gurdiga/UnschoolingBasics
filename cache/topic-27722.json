To me they are all important.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree.<br/>\nI sure wouldn&#39;t want someone else deciding the difference between my<br/>\nneeds and wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nJalen does some things that may seem bizarre to other people at times.<br/>\nOr make a big deal out of seemingly minor issues. But with his<br/>\nparticular personality and sensitivities, it IS a true need at the<br/>\nmoment. If I decided that his &quot;whims&quot; are just a want and not<br/>\nimportant, I can&#39;t imagine what that would do to his sense of self and<br/>\nhis ability to develop in his own time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use him as an example because sometimes he might be holding up an<br/>\nentire vehicle of kids that want to leave the park, in order to swing<br/>\na little bit longer. But in that moment, it is a NEED for him. He<br/>\nphysically needs those kind of motions to help him cope with life. My<br/>\nchildren are very understanding and willing to give so that he can<br/>\ntransition in his own time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I undermined that need, and didn&#39;t fulfill it, where would he be<br/>\ntoday? I shudder to think. Life seems to be more challenging for him<br/>\nin many ways, I like to smooth out the edges as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI trust him to let me know his needs and wants. I&#39;m not going to<br/>\ndecide for him that one is less than another (true of all my children).<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Wants and Needs","postDate":"1194969309","msgId":27723,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczNDc2NS41ODMyMi5xbUB3ZWI1MzgxMS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGM1Yi4xZDcwYTRhYS4zNDZiMTlmMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27722,"nextInTopic":27733,"prevInTime":27722,"nextInTime":27724,"topicId":27722,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There is a difference between a need and a want or desire.
