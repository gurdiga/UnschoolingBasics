I&#39;d bring one package home from the store, and they&#39;d  <br/>\nbe gone by the end of the day. I wasn&#39;t really paying attention, but  <br/>\nthen I heard Eric start to say things like, &quot;Will there be enough  <br/>\npudding for me?&quot; and I realized that even though I wasn&#39;t consciously  <br/>\nrestricting the pudding cups, I wasn&#39;t buying enough of them to keep  <br/>\nhim from experiencing a feeling of scarcity, which resulted in him  <br/>\ngetting anxious about pudding cups and needing to eat them all at  <br/>\nonce to be sure he got his share.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, a couple of weeks ago, I just without comment put two  <br/>\npackages in the cart. It didn&#39;t make it through the week, so I picked  <br/>\nup some more partway through the week. Eric liked opening the fridge  <br/>\nand seeing so many there. He liked feeling like he could have as many  <br/>\nas he wanted and there would still be more. He liked feeling so  <br/>\nconfident that there were enough that he could _offer_ pudding to his  <br/>\nfriends and little brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still bringing pudding cups home every week, but he might not  <br/>\neven eat one every day, and he doesn&#39;t dash to the grocery bags to  <br/>\nget them out first thing. He still likes having them around, but he  <br/>\ncan forget about them sometimes because he knows they&#39;ll always be  <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was an eye-opener to me to realize that he can experience a limit  <br/>\neven if I don&#39;t perceive myself to be setting one.

Binging is normal at first, but rather than say<br/>\nanything to your child, just start honoring their choices more...say<br/>\n&quot;yes&quot; more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefit from my point of view, is a balanced, whole child. A<br/>\nperson that trusts themselves and knows their own body.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I also think you need to see the whole picture of a<br/>\nchild that isn&#39;t &quot;food controlled&quot;. I DO notice symptoms of hunger,<br/>\ninbalance in my younger children and make sure to keep healthy foods<br/>\navailable. I will point out that they might need some protein, or<br/>\nmaybe a smoothie...I&#39;m not just putting out plates of candy and<br/>\nignoring them!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe bring a wide variety of foods into the house...some would be<br/>\nconsidered &quot;health food&quot; some would be called &quot;junk&quot;. It&#39;s just food.<br/>\nYeah, we talk about what is better for your body, but there&#39;s not a<br/>\nbunch of guilt associated with eating things that aren&#39;t as healthful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just part of the ebb and tide of life. Sometimes I want chocolate<br/>\nfor days in a row, but then I feel like salad, salad, salad.<br/>\nI want my children&#39;s choices to be honored, I don&#39;t want to send<br/>\nmessages that they aren&#39;t trustworthy.<br/>\nWhen children are raised like this, they are quite adept at figuring<br/>\nout what feels good and right for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids will ask for things like brocolli, brussel sprouts, raw<br/>\nsprouts, tofu etc...because I will also buy the candy, soda etc.. when<br/>\nthey ask (and sometimes just because).<br/>\n<br/>\nYour kids will only eat sugar if that&#39;s all you make available to<br/>\nthem. I dare you...I double dare you to put out a big platter of<br/>\ncrackers and cheese and grapes and carrots and dip and raisins and<br/>\npeanut butter and apples and (well, use your imagination) and just<br/>\nleave that big &#39;ol platter of yummy, healthy food on the table and<br/>\njust see if it disappears. <br/>\nNext time throw some chocolate chips on too...I bet they&#39;ll disappear<br/>\nfirst...but then so will the other stuff. Eventually, they&#39;ll trust<br/>\nthat there will be chocolate chips anytime they want &#39;em and the<br/>\ncarrots might disappear first. Truly.:) <br/>\n<br/>\nHuman beings naturally eat whatever is easiest and yummy (hey, we&#39;re a<br/>\nlot like squirrels aren&#39;t we?). So make a nice assortment of food<br/>\neasily available (usually &quot;junk&quot; food is the only thing readily<br/>\navailable..open and eat) and watch all that healthy stuff disappear<br/>\nbefore your eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9355,"nextTopicId":9057}}
