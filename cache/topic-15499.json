I am the one with more experience and have put more years into <br/>\nreading about homeschooling and unschooling, so I feel like I know <br/>\nwhat is best.  I&#39;m sure that my husband feels that vibe from me and <br/>\nfeels that I&#39;m not valuing his opinion.  He is starting to read a <br/>\nfew articles and read a couple chapters of Frank Smith&#39;s *The Book  <br/>\nof Learning and Forgetting*, but he reads them defensively- like <br/>\nwe&#39;re all trying to push some crazy idea - and just finds things to <br/>\nargue with.  It seems like we&#39;re in a bit of a power struggle- I&#39;m <br/>\narguing that the kids&#39; should have control over their own education <br/>\nand he&#39;s arguing that we need to teach them things.  We watched <br/>\nAlfie Kohn&#39;s Unconditional Parenting DVD together and that made a <br/>\nlot of sense to him.  He is a supporter of unconditional parenting, <br/>\njust not academic unschooling.  I will look for the tapes of Kohn <br/>\nafter the conference.  <br/>\n <br/>\nRevisiting Chris&#39;s school years is also a good idea.  We talked last <br/>\nnight- after the tension had eased up- about how he dropped his <br/>\ntyping class in hs because he was getting a *C* and was trying to <br/>\nkeep his grades up for Valedictorian (which he did get).  We laughed <br/>\nabout how he didn&#39;t really need that class, since now he types very <br/>\nwell just from working with computers.  So, if we can get out of <br/>\nthis power struggle maybe we can have some good dialogue about our <br/>\neducational experiences.

(But I encourage<br/>\neveryone else reading to correct me if they know of some sources.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend Alfie Kohn&#39;s writings as an interesting starting<br/>\npoint.  He&#39;s got many well-researched and enlightened-sounding<br/>\narticles on his website.  (You should be able to google his whole<br/>\nname.)  I&#39;ve read some, but not nearly all of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to mention a couple of his books.  He wrote one called<br/>\n_The Schools Our Children Deserve_.  What this book has is an appendix<br/>\n(A?) that summarizes research about learning that fits with what he is<br/>\ntalking about in his book.  The book AND the research both make the<br/>\npoint that what&#39;s best for children is individualized learning at<br/>\none&#39;s own speed (and probably not Phonics).  This book is not written<br/>\nBY homeschoolers or FOR homeschoolers, but it recommends types of<br/>\nlearning experiences that are hard to provide in a group setting in a<br/>\nclassroom but are much easier to provide to individual kids at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some concerns about using &quot;good job&quot; to get kids to work<br/>\nharder.  Some of these concerns are discussed in Kohn&#39;s book _Punished<br/>\nby Rewards_ and others in his recent parenting book _Unconditional<br/>\nParenting_.<br/>\n<br/>\nKohn is speaking at a Sacramento homeschooling conference in<br/>\nmid-August, so after that there should be tapes of his speeches for<br/>\nsale online at www.hsc.org   (Look for &quot;conference tapes&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel it is very important for parenting decisions, including those<br/>\nabout education, to be mutual.  This is tough if one parent hasn&#39;t or<br/>\nwon&#39;t do background reading or won&#39;t participate in sustained<br/>\ndiscussions.  But your situation sounds better than that.  Please look<br/>\nfor opportunities to discuss learning, education, etc. with your<br/>\nhusband at a time when you both are feeling calm and really have time<br/>\nto delve deeply into the topic.  If I was suddenly leaped into your<br/>\nshoes (like the TV show Quantum Leap), I&#39;d probably want to get your<br/>\nhusband talking about his experiences in school.  Maybe even go year<br/>\nby year and figure out how much he learned.  (I myself forgot an awful<br/>\nlot.)  I think you really have to hear &quot;where he is coming from&quot; and<br/>\nwhat his reservations are in order to marshall your arguments<br/>\nsuccessfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes wives ask their husbands to trust them for the first year of<br/>\nhomeschooling and then judge by the results at the end of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also good to make sure that spouses don&#39;t hate their jobs and<br/>\naren&#39;t jealous of how much fun unschooling is for everyone *except*<br/>\nthem.  Does your husband need you to make his life sweeter somehow?  I<br/>\nknow he probably got messages growing up that &quot;suffering builds<br/>\ncharacter&quot;, but I don&#39;t that&#39;s really true.  Maybe you can convince<br/>\nhim?  If he is embracing suffering, pour some sweetness and joy on him<br/>\nand see if you can convert him to the tap-dancing, yodelling,<br/>\nfingerpainting, joy-embracing side of life. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  I also like Frank Smith a lot!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209544912,"authorName":"Marcella O&#39;Brien","from":"&quot;Marcella O&#39;Brien&quot; &lt;marcellao@...&gt;","profile":"sajmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"intro and request for help with husband","postDate":"1152471210","msgId":15499,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTUwMWM2YTM4OCRmODhhNzBlMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBLb2R5Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15503,"prevInTime":15498,"nextInTime":15500,"topicId":15499,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have been basically unschooling up to this point, except a few months of me pushing a little schoolwork with my older son, Sean (age 9).  The pushing (along","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-651388124\">I have been basically unschooling up to this point, except a few months of me pushing a little schoolwork with my older son, Sean (age 9).  The pushing (along with traditional parenting methods of time out and such) resulted in a crisis situation where Sean started getting depressed, was violent towards us, and considered himself stupid.  I convinced my husband that we should back off all expectations, academic and otherwise, to give Sean time to heal.  It was just what was needed and Sean is now a happy, much more peaceful person.  We have switched to a peaceful, unconditional parenting approach, which my husband supports.  But he is not supportive of the academic part of unschooling.  I think it&#39;s the label or term that he is most uncomfortable with. Chris is growing concerned because Sean does not write, is very shy and is reluctant to try new things.  I don&#39;t agree with these concerns (they are true, by I don&#39;t see them as concerns), and instead see all the wonderful things Sean knows and does.  It seems like we&#39;re at a crossroads because Chris wants us to push academics more.  He makes all the usual false arguments (I&#39;ve had to do things I don&#39;t like in life, but it&#39;s helped me get where I am... People can&#39;t just do what they want all day long.) and doesn&#39;t agree with my answers.  I&#39;ve asked him to read books and articles, but he says everyone sounds too radical for him.  He seems to prefer research-based data to anecdotes about other children.  Plus, he&#39;s said that even if it&#39;s best for Sean that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s best for Jack (5) because Jack is less resistant to teaching and seems to like hearing * Good job * in tennis lessons and such. Now he&#39;s suggesting that we consider all academic options for the boys based on their individual needs.  I have spent the most time with the boys and have done all the reading on approaches and find unschooling to the best fit for all of us.  Chris wants me to sell it to him.  He asked me to pretend I&#39;m a teacher at a school and should explain why unschooling would be best for each child.  I don&#39;t know where to begin!!  I&#39;ve been telling him all along why it&#39;s best and all the benefits I see in the boys.  The boys are happy and creative, good problem solvers, and know tons of stuff the kids I taught didn&#39;t know. (I previously taught 5th grade in ps)  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this?? Thanks for any suggestions!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marcella in VA<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15487,"nextTopicId":15467}}
