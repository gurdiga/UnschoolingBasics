I <br/>\nthink a lot of things in our society were invented because of <br/>\nschool!  lol <br/>\n<br/>\nRen asked me to post this a while back but I haven&#39;t had a lot of <br/>\ntime to get on lists until this last couple days but in regards to <br/>\nthe above comment I thought it would fit in pretty good<br/>\n<br/>\nAn interesting excerpt from a book that Martin is reading called <br/>\nBefore You Quit Your Job, 10 Real Life <br/>\nLessons Every Entrepreneur Should Know About Building a Multimillion <br/>\nDollar Business:<br/>\n<br/>\nAre Some People Born Entrepreneurs?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Are people born entrepreneurs or are they trained to be <br/>\nentrepreneurs?&quot;  When I asked my rich dad his <br/>\nopinion on this age-old question, he said, &quot;Asking if people are <br/>\nborn or trained to be entrepreneurs is a <br/>\nquestion that makes no sense.  It would be like asking if people are <br/>\nborn employees or trained to become <br/>\nemployees?&quot;  he went on to say,  &quot;People are trainable.  They can be <br/>\ntrained to be either employees or <br/>\nentrepreneurs.  The reason there are more employees than <br/>\nentrepreneurs is simply that our schools train young <br/>\npeople to become employees.  That is why so many parents say to <br/>\nthere child, &#39;Go to school so you can get a <br/>\ngood job.&#39;  I have yet to hear any parent say, &#39;Go to school to <br/>\nbecome an entrepreneur.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEmployees Are a New Phenomenon<br/>\n<br/>\nThe employee is a rather new phenomenon.  During the agrarian age, <br/>\nmost people were entrepreneurs.  Many <br/>\nwere farmers who worked the king&#39;s lands.  They did not receive a <br/>\npaycheck from the king.  In fact, it was the <br/>\nother way around.  The farmer paid the king a tax for the right to <br/>\nuse the land.  Those who were not farmers <br/>\nwere tradespeople, aka small business entrepreneurs.  They were <br/>\nbutchers, bakers, and candlestick makers.  <br/>\nTheir last names often reflected their business.  That is why today <br/>\nmany people are named Smith, for the <br/>\nvillage blacksmith; Baker, for bakery owners; and Farmer, because <br/>\ntheir family&#39;s business was farming.  They <br/>\nwere entrepreneurs, not employees.  Most children who were raised in <br/>\nentrepreneurial families followed in <br/>\ntheir parents&#39; footsteps, also becoming entrepreneurs.  Again, it is <br/>\njust a matter of training.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was during the Industrial Age that the demand for employees <br/>\ngrew.  In response, the government took over <br/>\nthe task of mass education and adopted the Prussian system, upon <br/>\nwhich most Western school systems in the <br/>\nworld are today modeled.  When you research the philosophy behind <br/>\nPrussian education, you will find that the <br/>\nstated purpose was to produce soldiers and employees......people who <br/>\nwould follow orders and do as they were <br/>\ntold.  The Prussian system of education is a great system for mass-<br/>\nproducing employees.  It is a matter of <br/>\ntraining.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12708,"nextTopicId":12713}}
