Mary, First of all I appreciated what you wrote about your children.  That helps me have more confidence in the unschooling lifestyle.

But TV is not the enemy. In fact it can be a &gt;great unschooling ally if you learn to see it for the value it can bring to your child&#39;s otherwise interesting and full &gt;life.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;The first trick is to get in there and watch TV and play the PS2 with your kids. Figure out what they&#39;re getting from &gt;these games and programs and support that. TV has brought so much learning into our lives and has led to much, much more. &gt;There are times they binge and seem to watch a lot and times they expand and explore into other activities. It&#39;s kind of &gt;all connected. But by not demonizing the TV or XBox in our house, it&#39;s viewed as just another activity. Since you only &gt;got a TV a year ago and have been struggling with a homeschool schedule, TV is still new and inviting. I&#39;d let them fill &gt;their need until they&#39;re ready to branch out to other things.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mary,<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all I appreciated what you wrote about your children.  That helps me have more confidence in the unschooling lifestyle.  With respect to TV, I am so sick of Disney.  I can watch some of the TV shows but after a while I just want to regurgitate because it is too much!  Last year I gave up TV watching for 40 days.  It pretty much freed me up to do other things.  Now, my son is steeped in it and I just don&#39;t want to go back there.  I HATE video games.  I have never been into video games.  I don&#39;t have a problem with his love for TV or video games, but I can only take so much.  I remember other suggestions to just be in the room doing my own thing and that is working but a sistah is sick of TV.  There are other things that we like to do together but TV is his thing.  I know some of it has to do with the fact that we went from basic to expanded cable for the first time in his 5 yrs.  So Disney is totally novel to him.  I guess I am venting because I already feel that I know what the unschooling philosophy is.  I am just bored with TV.  Now that I think about it, I am bored with Disney.  I love PBS, I love Animal Planet.  Actually, I wish that I could binge on VH1 more.  But Disney and sometimes, Nick Jr, but mainly Disney is driving me nuts!  Okay, I am going to watch some Disney Channel now!  LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9118,"nextTopicId":9112}}
