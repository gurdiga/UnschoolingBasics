I have a fifteenth month old daughter, am new to unschooling,<br/>\nand have been gorging myself on the websites recommended here. I have also<br/>\nlearned a whole lot reading your questions and answers, thank you :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two questions I&#39;d really appreciate some feedback on:<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly,  I expected to return to work after a four month maternity leave<br/>\n(which I did and then quit three months later), and our plans (for<br/>\ntravelling, buying a home etc.) were based on both my husband and I<br/>\nbringing in an income. Even after having quit my job, I expected to return<br/>\nin a year, which became five years (when she&#39;d start preschool), and now<br/>\nperhaps never! I am really excited about unschooling, but I am worried that<br/>\nwe are going to struggle financially and that this may cause strife and<br/>\nimpact on our ability to provide our daughter with an environment that is<br/>\n&#39;rich&#39; enough for her to flourish. I worry that it is a luxury we may not<br/>\nbe able to afford. I would like to know whether any other families have<br/>\ndone well despite considerable financial constraints, or have had to<br/>\nsimilarly rethink &#39;plans&#39; and yet made it work. (I currently do editing<br/>\nwork at night, but it is slow-going and really doesn&#39;t pay well. I feel<br/>\nhelpless that I cannot contribute more to aid our situation.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, I feel that this decision to unschool provides the potential for<br/>\nmyself and my daughter to live quite a &#39;free&#39; life, to focus our energies<br/>\non living fully and joyfully, but in order to do so my husband has to slog<br/>\naway. He doesn&#39;t get to spend much time with her during the week. Being a<br/>\nstay-at-home mom is by no means easy, but it is extremely fulfilling, and I<br/>\ncannot say the same for his work. It just seems unfair. Any advice on how<br/>\nto navigate this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for a wonderful resource :)<br/>\nNicole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48780,"nextTopicId":48883}}
