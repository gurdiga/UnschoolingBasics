With Drew <br/>\nDorsey.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling in a Rotten Economy<br/>\nYou&#39;re a family who may  only have one working adult and maybe the trust fund <br/>\nhas suffered with the Wall  Street Adventures. Your teenager wants to trek <br/>\nthrough Europe, your preteen  wants a dirt bike, and your eight year old wants <br/>\nlots of Webkinz. What do you  do? How do you help everyone fulfill their dreams <br/>\nand still have something other  than Ramen noodles for supper? Hosted by Beth <br/>\nToolan<br/>\n <br/>\nEven More Different <br/>\nFace it, as unschoolers we live  out of the mainstream. But what if your <br/>\nfamily includes even more differences -  Disabilities, being gay, being of color, <br/>\nor anything else? How do you get  support within the unschooling community <br/>\nwith your difference, or in your other  communities as unschoolers? Hosted by <br/>\nKathryn Baptista, including Erika  Davis-Pitre.<br/>\n <br/>\nHow Will He Ever Learn to Read if You Don&#39;t TEACH Him?  <br/>\nYou&#39;ve heard it from friends, in-laws, strangers, even spouses: How will he  <br/>\never learn to read if you don&#39;t TEACH him? But I&#39;m here to tell you it&#39;s  <br/>\npossible. And the results are dramatic! <br/>\nReading is learned naturally---and  easily---in a world rich with text. We&#39;ll <br/>\ndiscuss ages and stages of reading,  gateways to comprehension, books that <br/>\ninspire, and hints to help you deal with  concerned &quot;others.&quot; With Kelly Lovejoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy Put the &quot;Radical&quot; in  Radical Unschooling?<br/>\nWhat IS &quot;radical unschooling&quot; and why is it  important? Why can&#39;t unschooling <br/>\nbe just about academics? It can, but then you&#39;d  be missing out on the BEST <br/>\nparts of your child&#39;s learning!
