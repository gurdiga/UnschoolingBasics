If you like LOA (you are exactly where you need to be, call the energy of the universe to your aid, etc) then its probably a good match. If you aren&#39;t into that stuff it will probably drive you away from unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nA note on internet etiquette - cross posting the same question to related lists is rude, since there&#39;s generally a bit of cross-over. At best, it creates confusing as people can&#39;t recall what&#39;s been said where if the threads get long. At worst, it peeves off the longtime writers and you get less gracious replies!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187853867,"authorName":"aldq75","from":"&quot;aldq75&quot; &lt;aldq75@...&gt;","profile":"aldq75","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: does this book represent the spirit un unschooling?","postDate":"1298342583","msgId":46227,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlqdjdybitpZ3A1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlqdjBtaCtqZ3RoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46226,"nextInTopic":46231,"prevInTime":46226,"nextInTime":46228,"topicId":46226,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have not read either book, but have read a lot at Sandra s website/blogs and Dayna s blog.

I have also watched both of them speak in YouTube videos. A bit of background on both authors:<br/>\n<br/>\nDayna&#39;s children are fairly young...I believe her oldest is just barely a teenager (or may still be a tween); she has been unschooling for less than ten years. She blends the Law of Attraction with her style of unschooling. Dayna bills herself as the &quot;leading voice&quot; in pioneering radical unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&#39;s children are grown (her youngest is 18-ish and her oldest is in his mid-20s), so she has been unschooling for about twenty years. Her approach is secular. Sandra is described as an unschooling advocate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea Q<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joy&quot; &lt;joy_bakker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also posted on the Always Unschooled list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, since I am not entirely sure if my kids have been always unschooled (they are 1 and 3 and we have practiced attachment parenting/consensual parenting since birth, we had an unassisted birth, etc...)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; but anyhow, I thought I would check this list out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know a lot of unschoolers go by Sandra Dodd&#39;s book, but a friend of mine lent me another book today, titled &quot;Radical Unschooling: A Revolution Has Begun&quot; by Dayna Martin, and I am looking forward to another perspective on unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has anyone read it?
