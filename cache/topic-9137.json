My 9 y.o. son and husband are taking turns building an <br/>\namusement park on Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. Earlier my son was <br/>\npainting the shield he is making for a Boy Scout project (it has a <br/>\nsnake on it, one of his favorite creatures, and he made sure to <br/>\npoint out to us that he painted the snake using 2 colors of green). <br/>\nThey were also tossing around ideas for a play they will do in their <br/>\nden, all the boys will have their home-made swords and shields, so <br/>\nI&#39;m sure it will be a play with alot of ACTION! I was out at the <br/>\ntime picking up a humane trap at a neighbor&#39;s house, we are working <br/>\non spaying/neutering a colony of feral cats in our neighborhood (but <br/>\nthat&#39;s a story for another list....) When I got home my son wanted <br/>\nto know how the trap worked so we set it and baited it and let one <br/>\nof our cats show us how to get trapped in it...and then <br/>\nreleased...no harm done...he is a tolerant cat!<br/>\nEarlier today my son and I watched &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot; since he has <br/>\nbeen interested in Knights and Dragons etc. ever since playing &quot;Fire <br/>\nEmblem Sacred Stones&quot; on his gameboy. He talks all about Druids, and <br/>\nKnights and weapons...I&#39;ve also rented Princess Bride and I want to <br/>\nfind Dragonheart to go along with this theme.... Before that he was <br/>\nbuilding Bionicles, he was matching them up by color with his <br/>\nmarbles and posing them around the livingroom. I was helping him <br/>\ntake pictures with the digital camera and later we&#39;ll make an album <br/>\nwith the photos. Gee...I guess we really do keep busy during the <br/>\nday...to top off the night we&#39;ll continue reading from the Murderous <br/>\nMaths series (my son loves these, but he insists we read them <br/>\ntogether, right now we&#39;re on &quot;Do you Feel Lucky? The Secrets of <br/>\nProbability!&quot;. Too bad I didn&#39;t get the Ben Franklin coin flip email <br/>\nuntil too late, or we would have done that too!<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nAmy (newbie lurker)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9133,"nextTopicId":9145}}
