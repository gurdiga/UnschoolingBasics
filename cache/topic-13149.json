Conor was more of a night person to begin with, and it&#39;s been more dramatic for him. He often pulls an all-nighter or stays up/sleeps for what seems like days.

When he hit <br/>\npuberty he shifted even more to the wee hours. He *can* get up before noon, but <br/>\nmuch prefers not to. He&#39;d probably be pretty happy with a job with overnight <br/>\nhours, we&#39;ll have to wait and see till he&#39;s old enough to be legally employed past <br/>\nten pm. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTed(27) was a middle of the roader - falling asleep easily late evening, <br/>\nwaking easily in the morning. As a teen he became an extreme night owl for several <br/>\nyears, but has shifted to where he is quite uncomfortable when he&#39;s held jobs <br/>\nwith evening hours or overnight hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah(14) has always needed more sleep than anyone else, starting in utero. <br/>\nShe was occasionally so still for so long that I&#39;d poke at her to make sure she <br/>\nwas still alive in there. Meanwhile, her wombmate Patrick would be making so <br/>\nmuch commotion it was clearly visible from across the room. &lt;g&gt; She&#39;s always <br/>\ntended towards the night owl end of the spectrum, but would usually go to sleep <br/>\ntwo hours or more before Patrick (and sleep a half hour to an hour after he <br/>\nwoke, as well.) At puberty she shifted farther into the night, staying up often <br/>\nwell past midnight. She is now a few years past puberty and is currently <br/>\nexperiencing another shift in sleeping pattern that she&#39;s finding painful. For <br/>\nweeks she&#39;s been waking many hours earlier than her usual, leaving her feeling <br/>\ngroggy and &quot;off&quot; all day. She&#39;s trying to purposely shift her going to sleep <br/>\ntime earlier to compensate.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa(21) was a lark as a young child. She&#39;d bounce into my room as the sun <br/>\nwas rising, put her face into mine and sing &quot;Good morning mommy! Isn&#39;t it a <br/>\nbeautiful day!&quot; Sometimes she&#39;d pry open my eyelids if I tried to keep them <br/>\nshut. :) It was really hard for me not to grouch back at her &quot;No, it is NOT a <br/>\nbeautiful day, it is too darn early to be up, go away!&quot; When she hit puberty she <br/>\nshifted into a night owl routine - for her that meant she sometimes was still <br/>\nawake at midnight. :) Currently she gets too little sleep by choice, staying <br/>\nup late to talk to her night owl boyfriend, getting up very early for college <br/>\nclasses. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13110,"nextTopicId":13135}}
