A toddler is a tiny little person only here on this earth a few years and IMO should NOT be burdened with labels and intentions like this. <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren want to please their elders. They want to be loved. They want to be liked. They want to learn how to do all the stuff the big people do. Sometimes it gets frustrating for them. They have little hands, get tired easily, get overwhelmed and hungry and are not yet skilled in the social graces. This is not the same  as &quot;malicious ill will prompting an urge to hurt or humiliate,&quot; the definition of spite.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this really how you want to think about your child, as spiteful, vindictive or malicious?  <br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://zenmommasgarden.blogspot.com/\">http://zenmommasgarden.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water.

That&#39;s a <br/>\nreasonable and good thing to do, but of course, I couldn&#39;t enunciate <br/>\nany of that back then.

You<br/>\nstill don&#39;t give it to her but you tell her that her hitting hurts.  &quot;Hmmm.<br/>\nMom didn&#39;t get the picture.  Let&#39;s hit her again harder so maybe this time<br/>\nshe will get it!&quot;  She isn&#39;t hitting you to hit you.  She is hitting you<br/>\nbecause she still has a need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":217204862,"authorName":"Misty Felner","from":"&quot;Misty Felner&quot; &lt;misty@...&gt;","profile":"mistyfelner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Digest Number 925- Thoughts","postDate":"1147703999","msgId":13178,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDExNDc1NjQ0MDEuMjQxMC44Njg0MC5tMjdAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13182,"prevInTime":13177,"nextInTime":13179,"topicId":13178,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"After reading some of Linda s responses and thoughts it gave the courage to post some thoughts I ve been having about some of the responses to dd is a hitter.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-428187611\">After reading some of Linda&#39;s responses and thoughts it gave the courage to<br/>\npost some thoughts I&#39;ve been having about some of the responses to dd is a<br/>\nhitter.  I am the original poster, and many people have replied saying that<br/>\nit&#39;s not possible for a 2.5 yo to do something maliciously.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\ngiving that a lot of thought, and even looked up the definitions for<br/>\nmalicious and vindictive in the dictionary.  They both stated that it was<br/>\ndoing something out of spite or for intentional harm.  I still feel that it<br/>\nis possible for a toddler to do something spiteful.  Examples... When dd<br/>\ndoes something that I say hurts, she understands what hurt is, and she gets<br/>\nthis spiteful look on her face and does it again even harder.  A friend of<br/>\nmine with a child the same age noticed that another child was picking on<br/>\nhers always taking toys from him etc.  One day her son had had enough and<br/>\n&quot;got even&quot; with him.  Most people respond saying that we&#39;re putting adult<br/>\nfeelings and emotions on a child, but at the same time they say that the<br/>\nchild doesn&#39;t understand  or can&#39;t express the feelings he&#39;s having.  They<br/>\nfeel frustrated, abandoned, lonely, jealous, but can&#39;t express it.  Well<br/>\nthese are all adult emotions and feelings I don&#39;t see how they differ.  I<br/>\nalso don&#39;t understand how someone can say that a 2 yo is capable of<br/>\nunderstanding that the food they ate 30 min or an hour, maybe even longer<br/>\nbefore is causing their tummy to ache, or that they feel cranky b/c they<br/>\nstayed up late the night before.  If they can understand that, why is it<br/>\nimpossible for them to do something out of spite.  And, if you still feel<br/>\nthey can&#39;t be malicious when are they capable of that is there a certain age<br/>\nor experience that suddenly causes them to be able to have those emotions.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think ill of my dd for experiencing this anymore than I would be<br/>\nangry with her for getting upset with frustration, it&#39;s just another<br/>\nfeeling, I&#39;m just trying to get her to learn that we don&#39;t act on those<br/>\nfeelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13242,"nextTopicId":13275}}
