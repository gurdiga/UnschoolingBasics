The kids are still destressing and  <br/>\ntrying to figure out what they want. this is long because of all the  <br/>\nkids, so that&#39;s your warning. Everyone is really into clubs right  <br/>\nnow, everyone has created one (well, not JOsh but the girls made the  <br/>\nvideogames club for him). They all have a secret password, they all  <br/>\nhave rules, absurdly difficult tests to get in, and special snacks in  <br/>\neach one. They build them up, help each other pass the tests, eat and  <br/>\ngiggle while I pretend not to notice that they&#39;ve nailed my comforter  <br/>\nto the deck. Some are funny (Sam&#39;s is the rhyming club, the words  <br/>\nhave to rhyme he doesn&#39;t care if you make up a word to rhyme or not)  <br/>\nsome are gross (Rachel&#39;s is the &#39;diarrhea club&#39; you have to eat  <br/>\nsomething that looks like, well, you know.

I&#39;m amazed but this is the  <br/>\nmost popular club)<br/>\n<br/>\nJosh suddenly decided he wanted to read all the harry potter books,  <br/>\nwhich he&#39;s never shown an interest in, so he&#39;s read all of them in  <br/>\nthe last three weeks. He also decided he wanted to learn how to play  <br/>\npokemon, so we&#39;ve been working on that, plus he&#39;s playing it on his  <br/>\nGBA. He&#39;s still reading the bible every day (he has the boys&#39; gross  <br/>\nfacts about the bible book) he&#39;s playing video games just about all  <br/>\nhe can the rest of the time,but he just unlocked the last thing on  <br/>\nmario kart, and he&#39;s maxed out the Tony Hawk game, and Harry potter,  <br/>\nso we&#39;re probably going to go looking at more. At that point he&#39;ll  <br/>\nhave to figure out how to make some money, we&#39;re dead broke for two  <br/>\nmore weeks. He checked a book out at the library about how to invest  <br/>\nmoney and make lots of money.<br/>\n<br/>\nBreanna spends every nice day outside mixing up mud. Lots of mud.  <br/>\nSometimes she mixes in sticks. Sometimes ashes from the fireplace.  <br/>\nShe makes runny mud and sees how far it will splash, she makes thick  <br/>\nmud to see how high it can stand. She lays on the ground in front of  <br/>\nher digging spot and arranges rocks in her mud. I would pay a lot of  <br/>\nmoney to know what she&#39;s thinking. But the mud is very important to  <br/>\nher right now. Rachel taught her how to use the sand castle boxes.  <br/>\nWell, Rachel used them and then Bre did. You can&#39;t teach Bre  <br/>\nanything, she gets really upset if you say, &quot;let me show you how....&quot;  <br/>\nShe must just observe. And since she&#39;s nonverbal, I can&#39;t just ask  <br/>\nher what&#39;s up.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily is spending alot of time figuring out how to make money for her  <br/>\nLenten box, and also figuring out what has corn in it. She wanted to  <br/>\ngive up corn products for Lent to understand what Breanna (who&#39;s  <br/>\nallergic) has to live with. She&#39;s really on a cleaning kick, and is  <br/>\nstarting to freak me out. Last week she walked up and asked if she  <br/>\ncould scrub the walls. Um. Okay. Right now everything is boring, and  <br/>\nshe seems to get frustrated easily. I&#39;m thinking she&#39;s learning alot  <br/>\nabout herself right now. She&#39;s also keen on the videogames. Although  <br/>\nshe just finished Pippi and Anne of Green Gables. We made a puppet  <br/>\nstage out of popsicle sticks and some pippi longstocking puppets. We  <br/>\nspent a few hours yesterday trying to take pictures of birds in our  <br/>\nbackyard with the digital camera. She really loves those (there are  <br/>\nsome great pictures she took on my blog)<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel is making stuff all the time, the craft stuff is on the table  <br/>\n24/7. She&#39;s making all kinds of puppets, pillows (she&#39;s held them  <br/>\ntogether with staples, hot glue, pipe cleaners, you name it...but  <br/>\nwhen I asked her if she wanted to use the sewing machine, she said no  <br/>\nway). I know she&#39;s learning a ton, but I couldn&#39;t verbalize what it  <br/>\nis. Mostly about how different materials work together, color, etc.  <br/>\nWe buy a lot of stuff on clearance at Hobby Lobby just to keep  <br/>\naround. Lots of glue. lots of paint. She checked out a few books on  <br/>\ncrafts, and we got a new highlights that had some fun spring games in  <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSam is learning how much fun it is to be the bad guy. He spends a lot  <br/>\nof time setting up scenarios that we follow along with, usually we&#39;re  <br/>\nthe good guys and he slaughters us. He explores our backyard a lot.  <br/>\nHe hikes up and down the hill in the back yard. He&#39;s been rolling  <br/>\nrocks down, and digging lots of holes. He&#39;s checking a lot of books  <br/>\nout at the library about dinosaurs and trying to find fossils. We&#39;re  <br/>\nprobably going to go to the natural history museum on Wednesday. I&#39;m  <br/>\nat a conference all day tomorrow and Tuesday, so dad&#39;s in charge  <br/>\nthen. We just found a really great book set for the leappad that is  <br/>\nabout dinosaurs, and has a trading card game in the back, different  <br/>\ndinosaurs match up, you choose friend or foe, and try to match up how  <br/>\nthey are similar or which one is more powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nDan is just, well, a two yo. he&#39;s spending all his time learning how  <br/>\nmuch power he has. he&#39;s a very powerful guy, very intense. I don&#39;t  <br/>\nknow what kind of resources we have for that, we watch a few toddler  <br/>\nshows and he&#39;s learning that. He&#39;s loving seeing his name written  <br/>\neverywhere, we buy the die cut shapes. He brings three up to me and  <br/>\nasks for me to write his name. He&#39;ll tell me &#39;first a D&#39;, then and A,  <br/>\nand an N. Sometimes he&#39;ll ask for another letter, and just laugh like  <br/>\nI&#39;m a fool when I write it down. He uses a magnadoodle a lot, and dh  <br/>\njust found the greatest thing, static cling write and wipe sheets. So  <br/>\nthere are these 2ft by 3ft white sheets stuck all over our house with  <br/>\nboxes of dry erase markers everywhere. Dan thinks its great to  <br/>\npretend he&#39;s writing on the wall and pats dh and says, Don&#39;t worry  <br/>\ndaddy, it&#39;s just pretend!<br/>\n<br/>\nAvari is working on crawling. No resource there except some socks to  <br/>\nkeep her knees from scratching up.

(I&#39;m <br/>\nbehind on email, trying to play catch up after a family emergency)<br/>\nWe pulled the kids out of school about a year ago. I sometimes think we are <br/>\nstill deschooling. For so long, any time I would suggest or even just mention <br/>\nanything to do, go see, check out etc. I would get a BIG &quot;NO WAY, NO THANKS <br/>\nMOM&quot;! That about killed me. I had to learn to just shut up and let them be! Boy <br/>\nwas THAT hard! I did sort of force them once to go with me to see a performance <br/>\nby the Jose Limone Dance Co. and they ended up being glad they went, it was <br/>\nawesome! But any other time, they would have adamantly turned me down. I&#39;m <br/>\nguessing this was all a part of a (very enjoyable for them) rebel towards anything <br/>\nthat they thought was schooly on their part!??? So, with that being said, now <br/>\nthat you have me thinking, I guess they are actually learning on their own!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur 12yo dd is into forensic science right now. (funny for someone who was <br/>\ntold by her last science teacher that &quot;she just wasn&#39;t going to be that good at <br/>\nscience)! She watches CSI like crazy, checked out 3 books on the subject from <br/>\nthe library and did a finger print experiment on all of us. (and wants to do <br/>\nmore experiments) There is a class coming up locally that is for one day where <br/>\nthey set up a crime scene and you try to solve the crime that she would like <br/>\nto go to. She&#39;s always loved reading and has recently found some new &quot;Royal <br/>\nDiary&quot; books at the library that she&#39;s always enjoyed. (series of biographies on <br/>\nroyalty, mostly women, in history) The one she&#39;s reading now is called <br/>\n&quot;Annacona&quot; about a princess from Haiti back in 1490. She also loves her horse and dog <br/>\nand has entered them both in 4-H, dog obedience classes and horsemanship. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur youngest (11yo dd) has just recently come back around to a love for <br/>\nreading and is on the 4th Hairy Potter book. (She is a Hairy Potter fanatic) She is <br/>\ninto fairies and wizards and plays and reads about them all the time. She <br/>\nalso wants to learn how to live in the wild and just checked out books from the <br/>\nlibrary on living off the land and a book called &quot;Worse Case Scenarios&quot; about <br/>\nwhat to do in various emergencies. She is also into 4-H with her dog. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a creek out back that they both play at all the time where they have <br/>\nmade a &quot;Village&quot; with the neighbor kids. They built houses out of wood and <br/>\nbranches, they each have &quot;jobs&quot; within the village, they write a monthly <br/>\nnewspaper for it. That keeps them VERY busy. They would like to start up a business of <br/>\ntheir own selling eggs from our chickens, we&#39;ve had several requests from <br/>\nfriends for some but we&#39;d have to get more chickens, right now, we only have <br/>\nenough to supply our family with eggs. They both love messing around on the <br/>\ncomputer and playing Neopets.

Below are a few of his interests right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nEgyptology<br/>\n    Tristan loves, loves, LOVES mummies and Ancient Egypt.  We have found a number of books over the years that he still enjoys looking through.  I also subscribed him to a kid&#39;s archaeology magazine called &quot;Dig!&quot;  He&#39;ll watch (or we record) nearly every documentary that comes onto TV that has to do with mummies or Egypt.  For a time, Friday night seemed to be Egyptology night, and we&#39;d watch 3+ hours worth of documentaries.  We&#39;ve also found a few kits...some good, some terrible.  The &quot;Lift the Lid on Mummies&quot; kit was great, but we found one made by Slinky that was a complete waste of money.  In theory, you make your own plaster mummy.  Well, the mold was very cheap plastic, and the plaster was terrible....nothing turned out.  I found some better plastic and with a lot of care, we were able to make a decent mummy cast.  Live and learn, I guess, when it comes to these types of kits!!<br/>\n<br/>\nForensic science/criminal justice<br/>\n    One night we were watching a documentary on Ancient Egypt, and they were working on the facial reconstruction of a pharaoh.  This led to us finding a clay facial reconstruction kit online (it happens to be of Julius Caesar).  We are working on this now, and he&#39;s also reading bits and pieces of a book he found called &quot;Silent Witness.&quot;  This has lead to all sorts of discussions about the death penalty, Saddam Hussein&#39;s trial, and many other topics.<br/>\n<br/>\nCreating Games<br/>\n    Tristan will pull parts from several games (say, the board from one, cards from another) and create his own game...always with an elaborate set of rules to go along with it! LOL  He recently finished the game &quot;Gauntlet Dark Legacy&quot; on PS2.  He has created and drawn a whole line of characters and has come up with an outdoor game he is dying to play with this friends once it warms up.<br/>\n<br/>\nTristan also spends a lot of time playing on his PS2 and building with Legos.  Right now we are creating a Lego village, complete with courthouse and jail.  The only problem here is that we are running low on building materials! ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\nMalinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling kids interests?","postDate":"1142181278","msgId":10679,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR2MWlpdStsMWtwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGQ1LjM4YjFhMDIzLjMxNDVhNDFkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":10678,"nextInTopic":10693,"prevInTime":10678,"nextInTime":10680,"topicId":10666,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My ds is almost 12 and my dd is almost 8.  <br/>\nMy son is into Yu-gi-oh.  Every aspect of it.  He only started reading <br/>\nlast year, mainly because he wanted to play the game.  He had me read <br/>\nthe whole rule book to him from cover to cover when he started playing <br/>\nand amazingly, he learned to play that way.  We got him a pc game <br/>\nwhich is now boring to him (it was one of the first games and he can&#39;t <br/>\nbuild the deck like he wants to).  We don&#39;t have cable, but we rented <br/>\nall the episodes from Blockbuster so he could catch up with the show.  <br/>\nNow he wants me to teach him how to use the internet to research Yu-gi-<br/>\noh.  He wants to know the history of it and who came up with the <br/>\ngame.  He wants to study strategies for building decks.  I&#39;m helping <br/>\nhim find the information he wants on the web.  Google searches and <br/>\nsuch.  We have found some neat sites with much of the info he wants.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHouston also likes to build with Legos.  We are fortunate to have a <br/>\ngreat Lego Store only an hour away.  He also loves to watch old <br/>\ncomedians like Charlie Chaplin, Fatty Arbuckle, and Buster Keaton (his <br/>\npersonal favorite).  He loves slap-stick comedy and our library has a <br/>\nlot of good videos and dvds.  We also buy them pretty cheap when we <br/>\nrun across them.  He also enjoys playing outside and swimming in our <br/>\npool.  He enjoys playing Call of Duty and Star Wars Battlefront 2 on <br/>\nhis ps2.  He also likes to play card games (Blackjack, Poker, Rummy, <br/>\netc.)  But right now, his passion is Yu-gi-oh.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd, Abby loves horses.  She is only 7 but she checks out the Horses <br/>\nmagazine every time we go to the library.  She loves animals of all <br/>\nkinds.  She checks out books on them and we watch videos.  She enjoys <br/>\nPBS shows on animals (we don&#39;t have cable right now).  She also loves <br/>\nto write.  She writes me notes all day long.  Many times she will <br/>\nwrite me a note instead of just telling me what she wants to say.  She <br/>\nalso loves to sew.  She has made a quilt pillow and skirts and a <br/>\npurse.  She loves using the machine!  She loves to play dress-up.  She <br/>\nalso loves to swim and play outside.  She really enjoys the Big Comfy <br/>\nCouch, Mya and Miguel, and Dragon Tales on PBS.  She also loves Power <br/>\nRangers and Kim Possible.  We check out those videos and dvds at the <br/>\nlibrary since we don&#39;t have cable.  We&#39;re hoping to get cable soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for that question.  It&#39;s fun talking about what my kids love.  <br/>\nYour oldest son is probably into a lot of stuff that might just not <br/>\nlook &quot;schooly&quot; to you.  Maybe the same with your 5yos.  How do they <br/>\nspend their time?  Try to get into what they do and help them find out <br/>\nmore about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your oldest is into one particular ps2 game help him find walk-<br/>\nthroughs and get into it yourself.  The same with your youngest.  If <br/>\nhe likes ps2 games, play with him.  If he likes Legos, go out and get <br/>\nhim a new set.

He made some business cards  and <br/>\nhas been taking orders for neighbors, family and friends.  He custom  makes them <br/>\nwith duct tape in colors or camaflouge tape and met several neighbors  this <br/>\nway as well making some money. He&#39;s playing PS2 and we&#39;re enjoying playing  <br/>\nboard games after having them packed away for awhile.  He beat me at  <br/>\ncheckers...again..:-) last night.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBrenna is spending time playing guitar and working on some songs she is  <br/>\ngoing to sing for a local competition in a late spring.  She got her  driver&#39;s <br/>\nlicense last week and yesterday drove herself to the library which is  about 25 <br/>\nminutes from the house.  Very weird for me but she left and came  home with a <br/>\nbig smile and a big pile of books and CD&#39;s.  Usually she spends  lots of time <br/>\nreading and she&#39;s still doing that some but she has a new interest  that she <br/>\nhas immersed herself in.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe wants to take some courses at the community college in the fall and one  <br/>\nof the requirements to take them is to have taken the SAT or  ACT.  She is <br/>\ntaking them April 1 so she is happily working through some SAT  books and tests <br/>\nand making vocabulary cards and asking me to quiz  her.   The cool thing about <br/>\nthis is after our years of unschooling she  is choosing to do this and is <br/>\nexcited and happy and having so much fun with  it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t view it any differently than some of her other recent passions  <br/>\nlike making ATC cards, learning to drive, writing a novel for NaNoWriMo or just <br/>\n reading to her hearts content.<br/>\n <br/>\n It has been so fun to watch her so excited about something many  schooled <br/>\nkids see as stressful.  Unschooling has given her the power to be  passionate <br/>\nabout anything she chooses to do.<br/>\n <br/>\nGail<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":218128791,"authorName":"happyfallingleaf@gmail.com","from":"happyfallingleaf@...","profile":"streetresearcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling kids interests?","postDate":"1142175687","msgId":10671,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwNjdiNzM2MDYwMzEyMDcwMXM1YjdjOGI0MXljNjBhZWRhMTBiNDg0MDY3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwMzEyMTQzNTMzLjEwNDkwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMDEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGR2MWIzcysxNnY4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDIwMDYwMzEyMTQzNTMzLjEwNDkwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMDEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10670,"nextInTopic":10676,"prevInTime":10670,"nextInTime":10672,"topicId":10666,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We just started unschooling this past week, I have three children, Deven 15, Samantha 14 and Jake 5 on the 30th.

I can see the damage I&#39;ve<br/>\nalready caused him and he has trouble expressing what his interests are. His<br/>\nfocus seems to be more on just having time with his dad.
