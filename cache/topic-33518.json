She can read a few words and some<br/>\nvery short, repetitive books, but not much more.  She does not do well<br/>\nphonically and tends to just memorize whole words.  She does not like<br/>\nto try to write words unless she knows exactly how they are written.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, she and her little brother were making an Aquarium for me to go<br/>\nvisit with all their plastic fish and such.  She was making signs and<br/>\nasked me how to spell &quot;Snacks&quot; which I spelled aloud for her.  She hung<br/>\nher sign up and I noticed that the word was written backwards.  The<br/>\nletters were all facing the right way, but the entire word was written<br/>\nfrom right to left.  She tends to make some of her letters backwards,<br/>\nlike the G in her name, but because she doesn&#39;t write unknown words<br/>\nvery often, it kind of threw me for a loop when she did this.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I be concerned?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t seem to bother Leonardo da Vinci. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan has written entire paragraphs backwards. He doesn&#39;t do it much <br/>\nany more---sometimes though. He still writes most of his numbers <br/>\nbackwards. Phone numbers that he takes down for me are still backwards. <br/>\nBut completely readable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI practiced writing backwards as a child/teen. With my left hand. I can <br/>\nstill do it, but it&#39;s not as fluent. Right to left and backwards, <br/>\nmirror image. It&#39;s cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe won&#39;t do it forever (unless she practices &lt;g&gt;).

Give it some time with the backwards","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2088180405\">Oh, I see, I didn&#39;t catch this first post when I responded just now.  My 9 y.o. daughter is just reading, same as yours.  Give it some time with the backwards thing, just modeling your spelling.  If her reading and writing get further along and she&#39;s still doing the backwards writing, maybe look into intervention, just to make sure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy .02,<br/>\n<br/>\n~Melissa, in MD :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: melissa_hice <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, June 04, 2008 8:00 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Should I Be Concerned?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My DD (9) is basically a non reader.
