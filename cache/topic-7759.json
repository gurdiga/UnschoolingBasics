Its been a crazy year. I was preggo when I met you and I lost that baby at almost 14 weeks. Well I am due again February 4th.<br/>\nI did meet Josefina we have been close friends with her and her son but they just moved up to the cities.<br/>\nI lurk here and I love it also. I probably check my e-mail 4 or 5 times a day just to read all the wonderful discussions here.<br/>\nI also just got Rue&#39;s book and I read it in 2 days. It is great.<br/>\nIf you remember I have a son who will be 4 next June. He was always very &quot;high need&quot; and intense. He is wonderful!<br/>\nI also trying to learn as much as possible about having more than one child. I want to be better. I get all the unschooling life and we have been unschoolers (even without knowing) from day one) but I make too many mistake. I catch myself saying horrible things and getting really frustrated at times..<br/>\nWell I hope we can get together again sometime. <br/>\nGreat to &quot;see&quot; you.,<br/>\nAlex<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: crissyhall <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, November 16, 2005 11:41 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Intro, etc<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jann,  thanks for the welcome!

So if you can explain my radical &quot;crunchy&quot; <br/>\n  idea to &quot;Mr. Logical&quot; (who needs &quot;scientific proof&quot;), that&#39;s saying A<br/>\n  LOT! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now you made my day when you said that I was being mindful and<br/>\n  respectful!  I know that I have a long way to go, but it&#39;s good to<br/>\n  know that I&#39;m moving in the right direction.  I really need to work on<br/>\n  being more &quot;present&quot; with the kids and trying to make transitions<br/>\n  easier.
