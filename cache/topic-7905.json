There was also a &quot;First&quot; Thanksgiving in America, but it was <br/>\ncelebrated thirty thousand years ago. At some time during the New <br/>\nStone Age (beginning about ten thousand years ago) Thanksgiving <br/>\nbecame associated with giving thanks to God for the harvests of the <br/>\nland. Thanksgiving has always been a time of people coming together, <br/>\nso thanks has also been offered for that gift of fellowship between <br/>\nus all. Every last Thursday in November we now partake in one of the <br/>\nOLDEST and most UNIVERSAL of human celebrations, and THERE ARE MANY <br/>\nTHANKSGIVING STORIES TO TELL.<br/>\n--Chuck Larsen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a pretty cool blog, I had fun looking through it:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unschoolingresources.blogspot.com/\">http://unschoolingresources.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7876,"nextTopicId":7880}}
