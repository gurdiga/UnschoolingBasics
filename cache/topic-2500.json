No sushi for a while.

Alas<br/>\nno weight loss either. Then I did have a problem. What was going on?<br/>\nAllergic to chicken? IBS? Nope. Turns out I had a creeping onset (not a<br/>\nmedical term but descriptive) lactose intolerance. Just as well I didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to rely on dairy as a primary protein source anymore.

One of the things that turned<br/>\nlightbulbs on for me the fastests as I read &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; recently,<br/>\nwas the author&#39;s modeling of actual conversations with parents and children.<br/>\nSo, Sharon, in the event this is helpful to you, here is how a conversation<br/>\nI feel is respectful to both my children and myself about veal that might<br/>\nget us to a compromise might go:<br/>\n<br/>\nDaughter:  &quot;Mom, I just saw this cool sounding thing called veal you can<br/>\neat.  What does it taste like?  I want to try some.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know what veal tastes like.  Veal comes from cows.  I&#39;ve<br/>\ndecided not to eat it because I saw a TV show about how the cows are treated<br/>\nto make veal, and I hated the way the cows are treated.  I don&#39;t want to buy<br/>\nveal because that&#39;s supporting the cows being treated in a way I really<br/>\ndisagree with.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDaughter:  &quot;How do they treat the cows?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  &quot;Well, veal is really tender cow meat.  To make the cow&#39;s bodies that<br/>\ntender, they have to keep the cows in a little stall their whole entire<br/>\nlives.  The cows never get to go outside that stall, ever.  It really<br/>\nbothers me to think of an animal spending their whole life in a dark stall.<br/>\nIt angers me that people would do that to animals for any reason, and I<br/>\nreally have a hard time with people doing it so their meat is more tender.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDaughter (assuming she&#39;s not persuaded): &quot;Well, I really want to try it<br/>\nanyway.  Can you make some for me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  &quot;Well, I respect that you make the choice about what you want to eat.<br/>\nBut this does require my involvement if you want me to go to the store, buy<br/>\nveal, then cook it.  I think that would be a really hard thing for me to do.<br/>\nI&#39;m having a hard time picturing myself doing it.  How do you think we could<br/>\nresolve this?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDaughter:  &quot;Well, maybe I could go to a restaurant with Dad and have some.<br/>\nThat way you don&#39;t have to buy it or cook it or be there when I eat it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  &quot;Good idea.

I know<br/>\nthat not everyone  here has a spiritual preference or wants to even think<br/>\nabout it but it is still  an area of  learning/modeling so the principle<br/>\nshould be the same, I would think.I am asking to know and not to start a<br/>\ndebate.

This could be for anything from diet<br/>\nchoices to movies,music etc.  ... as the child gets older say 7-10 ish the<br/>\nchild wants it and Mom feels strongly about the belief? Her<br/>\nresponse is to tell the child that she feels uncomfortable about him doing<br/>\nthat and while he lives in her house he needs to live by those standards<br/>\nwhether he agrees or not.   This scenario is played out in thousands of<br/>\nhomes daily.....how could that parent model her beliefs with the child to<br/>\nmake it possible to find an acceptable middle ground for both of them?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t see a specific response to this - and I don&#39;t know if it got lost<br/>\nin the thread, but I think it&#39;s worth singling out.  I&#39;m not a religous<br/>\nperson, but this morning I thought about something I&#39;ve found difficult and<br/>\nhow I&#39;ve handled it ... and I&#39;m wondering if anyone else, even if not<br/>\nreligous, has other examples too.  I think a better other example than the<br/>\none Sharon stated might be, for example, if anyone on this list is<br/>\nvegetarian or vegan, with strong underlying beliefs against the killing of<br/>\nanimals for human consumption, or the treatment of animals to make certain<br/>\nfoods (the way cows are treated to make veal for example which is a reason I<br/>\npersonally never eat veal).  How do you handle it if your child asks to eat<br/>\nmeat or veal - especially since you would likely have to purchase it and<br/>\ncook it?  How do you respect and honor what is SO important in unschooling,<br/>\nthe choices of the child, while still living with your own strong feelings<br/>\nand beliefs?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that with veal, I would explain to my child what veal is, why I don&#39;t<br/>\neat it which would include an age appropriate description of how they treat<br/>\nthe cows in the making of it (or I&#39;d just say I didn&#39;t like how they treated<br/>\nthe cows and see if they wanted to hear more).  I&#39;m hoping that would be<br/>\nsufficient to at least make them consider the question.  If they decided<br/>\nthey wanted to try it anyway, it would be really hard for me, but I think I<br/>\nwould put my belief in supporting their choosing first, and recognize that<br/>\nmy feelings about veal are just that, my own feelings, and forcing them on<br/>\nmy children feels as oppressive as forcing any of my other beliefs and<br/>\nfeelings on them.  And my feeling is that children who feel things forced on<br/>\nthem at some point as they get older rebel against those beliefs as not of<br/>\ntheir own choosing.  The reality is that my children will make their own<br/>\nchoices as they get older and it seems likelier they will be open to at<br/>\nleast strongly considering what I have to say if I present it as my feelings<br/>\nand explain it instead of making a rule about it or insisting it&#39;s going to<br/>\nbe such and such a way because it&#39;s &quot;my house&quot; - actually I believe it is<br/>\nthe house of each member of my family - I&#39;d always want them to feel that<br/>\nway.

My kids,<br/>\nwho have always been sensitive to what they decide is &quot;scary&quot; decided to<br/>\nwatch &quot;Scooby Doo&quot; (that&#39;s my 5 year old daughter and 3 yr old son).  My<br/>\ndaughter had always decided from the covers of the Scooby stuff before that<br/>\nit looked too scary.  My daughter has found herself scared of &quot;Little Bear&quot;<br/>\nbefore which is the gentlest thing ever, so that&#39;s where we&#39;re working from.<br/>\nSo we watched it.  The first time, my daughter would run out of the room at<br/>\nsome of the stuff, and my son would hide behind the pillows.  I reminded<br/>\nthem how the remote control worked and how they could skip what was scary.<br/>\nI reminded them they could turn it off.  They chose the remote control (of<br/>\ncourse, this was a video, so they have that control...and maybe one idea is<br/>\nto suggest taping a scary TV show so your son could do the same).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they used the remote and after each watching they used it less and less.<br/>\nPretty soon episodes they had previously skipped as too scary, they were<br/>\nwatching.  They did have a few nights with restless sleep on my daughter&#39;s<br/>\npart, and some nightmare stuff on my son&#39;s part I thought was related to<br/>\nwatching it.  The day after the sleep disturbances, they asked to watch it<br/>\nagain.   The way I responded was to remind them of the sleep disturbances<br/>\nand nightmares, and say that I believed they might be related to watching<br/>\nScooby, what did they think?  Because I think what they might need help with<br/>\nis hooking up the watching with the nightmares - the connection between the<br/>\ntwo might not occur to them.  In this instance, they said &quot;No, mom&quot;.  I<br/>\nrespected that and they&#39;ve been watching ever since.  They have not had any<br/>\nmore sleep disturbances or nightmares since we had that conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving thought a lot about it, I do not feel it is respectful at all to them<br/>\nfor me to decide what is too scary FOR them, plus I think they have good<br/>\nradar for that and I want to encourage them to challenge what seems scary<br/>\nwhen they want to, while also respecting what feels too scary. At the same<br/>\ntime, I want to help them.  I can do that by saying about a potential<br/>\nmovie/show - &quot;Sometimes you&#39;ve said you don&#39;t like certain scary things or<br/>\nsad things, and this looks like it could fit into that category&quot; and we talk<br/>\nabout it.  I make sure that there is no &quot;incidental&quot; TV or shows on that<br/>\nthey have not chosen - something my husband wants to watch for example - I<br/>\nask him to watch it out of their sight so that they do not end up scared by<br/>\nsomething they just happen to see, they haven&#39;t made a decision about it.  I<br/>\ncan do it by trying to point out how reactions I see by them like nightmares<br/>\nor other things might be related to try to help them make decisions.  But<br/>\nthe decisions always need to be theirs and I&#39;m available to sit beside them<br/>\nand watch too or talk about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my suggestion is instead of deciding for your son, talk to him about the<br/>\nnightmares, remind him of the proximity of them to the show and ask him<br/>\nabout it - does he think they&#39;re related?  Ask him if taping it so he could<br/>\ntake breaks or skip certain parts of it would help.  Respect that in the end<br/>\nonly HE really knows what&#39;s too scary for him.  You can be his partner and<br/>\nwork with him instead of deciding for him and the benefits of doing that are<br/>\nenormous.  Both of you will feel respected and like a team instead of<br/>\nadversaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps...I greatly respect your move out into new territory with<br/>\nyour son.
