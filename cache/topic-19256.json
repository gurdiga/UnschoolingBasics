A lot of people on this board and others are up in arms thinking the show was terrible.  Maybe it was and I&#39;m not seeing it.  Knowing that these types of shows (Dr. Phil, Oprah, etc.) are all about Ratings and Sensationalism, I expected the worst.  I was pleasantly surprised that they actually presented both sides, and the homeschoolers/unschoolers were not totally blasted.  I have seen Dr. Phil totally brow beat people in the past, and because of it I had stopped watching his show.  Anyway at the end of the show they had this 26 year old gal on that had been homeschooled, and she was anti-homeschooling.  She said it made her socially retarded, and that she to this day was afraid to go to College because she had never been exposed to a classroom type setting.  Well I had to wonder what the rest of the story was on that one.  The homeschooled teens I know where we live are involved in sports, clubs, going to homeschool proms,<br/>\n teen groups, 4-H, oh the list goes on and on........these kids are not socially retarded by any stretch.

Of course in any type of show like this they <br/>\nhave to give views of all sides.  But I thought it put a positive <br/>\nspin on Homeschooling and Unschooling.  I think though the thing <br/>\npeople don&#39;t realize is that there is such a varied group of <br/>\nhomeschoolers and unschoolers out there (some people want to put <br/>\nthem all in one group, and think they are all the same).  One woman <br/>\nin the audience was an unschooler and she did a nice job showing <br/>\nwhat a wonderful, rich life her 3 kids are living and that the 3 <br/>\nkids are happy.  And the unschooler on the stage did a good job too, <br/>\nand she made the point that her kids have a choice whether they want <br/>\nto go to school or not.  I think probably a lot of America has never <br/>\nheard of Unschooling or does not understand Unschooling so it put <br/>\nthe word out and hopefully it will make people think about it.  They <br/>\nhad a public school teacher talking about how wonderful public <br/>\nschool was, and she just was not convincing to me.
