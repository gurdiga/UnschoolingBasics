Mass-mail<br/>\nworms<br/>\nhave<br/>\nusually been contained in an attachment with an e-mail note<br/>\nencouraging<br/>\na<br/>\nuser to open it.<br/>\nThe worm, written in JavaScript, takes advantage of a vulnerability<br/>\nthat<br/>\nallows scripts embedded in HTML e-mail to run in the users&#39;<br/>\nbrowsers.<br/>\nYahoo<br/>\nusers should be able to modify their settings to block the zero-day<br/>\nexploit,<br/>\nHogan said.<br/>\nSymantec rated the worm a Level 2 threat, one notch above its least<br/>\nharmful<br/>\nranking. Hogan said the worm did not appear to be spreading widely,<br/>\nand<br/>\nhe<br/>\ndid not anticipate the threat level rising.<br/>\nHow It Spreads<br/>\nWhen activated, the worms then sends itself to other users in the<br/>\nvictim&#39;s<br/>\naddress book who also use Yahoo e-mail with the suffixes of<br/>\n@...<br/>\nor<br/>\n@yahoogroups.com. The worm mimics a function within Yahoo&#39;s Web mail<br/>\ncalled<br/>\nQuickbuilder,&quot; which allows a user to add contacts in an address<br/>\nbook<br/>\nfrom<br/>\nreceived e-mail, Hogan said. The process, however, is transparent to<br/>\nthe<br/>\nvictim, he said.<br/>\nThe harvested e-mail addresses are sent to a remote server. Users of<br/>\nYahoo<br/>\nMail Beta do not appear to be affected, Symantec said.<br/>\nThe worm also opens a browser that displays a Web page that does not<br/>\nappear<br/>\nto contain malicious content.<br/>\nAlthough Yahoo&#39;s Web e-mail has not been fixed, users are advised to<br/>\nupdate<br/>\nvirus and firewall definitions and block any e-mail sent from<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:av3@...\">av3@...</a>.<br/>\nThe subject line of the e-mail with the worm says &quot;New Graphic<br/>\nSite,&quot;<br/>\nand<br/>\nthe body says &quot;this is test.&quot;<br/>\nYahoo officials could not immediately be reached for comment</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14278,"nextTopicId":14449}}
