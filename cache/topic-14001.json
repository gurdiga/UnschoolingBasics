Talk about overwhelming!  <br/>\nAnyway, I sit for two of them, now 10 months and 6 weeks.  The six <br/>\nweek old lives with us as well.  I was wondering if there are any <br/>\nlists out there that you all may know of that would be beneficial to <br/>\nsomeone in my situation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve discovered that this aspect of my life weighs on my ability to <br/>\nbe an effective unschooling mother, and I would like to find support <br/>\nand/or resources to help me balance this part of my life.  My <br/>\nyoungest is 12, so baby days are LONG since over for me.  Not to <br/>\nmention, we are a combined family with seven children.  Only two are <br/>\nmy biological children, and they are EIGHT years apart.  I&#39;ve never <br/>\ndone two in diapers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love my grandbabies, and as their Nana I feel a strong need to <br/>\ncare for them as opposed to seeing them go to daycare.
