My<br/>\nhusband is dubious, but supportive.  He felt the same way about AP in<br/>\nthe beginning.

Now, I am done and cannot<br/>\n&gt; find a job, so I took her out of school to save money and to give us<br/>\n&gt; some time to spend together (like we used to before I started school).<br/>\n&gt; She is a bright, sweet, loving child who has been AP&#39;ed from the<br/>\n&gt; beginning. She loved her first year of preschool, but the last<br/>\n&gt; semester was a nightmare for both of us. She became an outsider<br/>\n&gt; because of one little girl who did not like her, and the teachers<br/>\n&gt; would not listen to my concerns about the situation. She has been so<br/>\n&gt; much happier in the last six weeks since she left school, and I want<br/>\n&gt; to explore my options in the next 7 months or so that we have before<br/>\n&gt; pre-K starts. (School starts at 4 here, but it&#39;s not compulsory until<br/>\n&gt; age 7).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What are some good ways to get started? I plan to hit our local<br/>\n&gt; library to see if I can find some books, but I&#39;d like some<br/>\n&gt; recommendations for a book to buy. Money is tight right now, so if<br/>\n&gt; you could recommend one book for a parent considering unschooling,<br/>\n&gt; what would it be?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She is very verbal, she can remember complex words and use them<br/>\n&gt; correctly after hearing them in context a few times. She has little<br/>\n&gt; interest in coloring, drawing or painting, except as a diversion when<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s bored with other activities. She likes to help me cook and do<br/>\n&gt; dishes, and she&#39;s fascinated with our garden. So what do I do? My<br/>\n&gt; gut tells me to just keep her involved in what I&#39;m doing and follow<br/>\n&gt; her interests from there. We go to the library occasionally, and I<br/>\n&gt; plan to do that more often these next few months.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any advice is appreciated, I&#39;m glad I found this group!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shannon<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":334703817,"authorName":"Cary Seston","from":"Cary Seston &lt;cary.seston@...&gt;","profile":"cary.seston","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: New member, seriously considering unschooling","postDate":"1232598339","msgId":38034,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc4NTY2NC41NjM0OC5xbUB3ZWI0NTcxMC5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38027,"nextInTopic":38040,"prevInTime":38033,"nextInTime":38035,"topicId":38024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been Radically Unschooling our 3 children under 6 only for a year.

Now, I am done and cannot<br/>\nfind a job, so I took her out of school to save money and to give us<br/>\nsome time to spend together (like we used to before I started school).<br/>\nShe is a bright, sweet, loving child who has been AP&#39;ed from the<br/>\nbeginning. She loved her first year of preschool, but the last<br/>\nsemester was a nightmare for both of us. She became an outsider<br/>\nbecause of one little girl who did not like her, and the teachers<br/>\nwould not listen to my concerns about the situation. She has been so<br/>\nmuch happier in the last six weeks since she left school, and I want<br/>\nto explore my options in the next 7 months or so that we have before<br/>\npre-K starts. (School starts at 4 here, but it&#39;s not compulsory until<br/>\nage 7).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are some good ways to get started? I plan to hit our local<br/>\nlibrary to see if I can find some books, but I&#39;d like some<br/>\nrecommendations for a book to buy. Money is tight right now, so if<br/>\nyou could recommend one book for a parent considering unschooling,<br/>\nwhat would it be?<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is very verbal, she can remember complex words and use them<br/>\ncorrectly after hearing them in context a few times. She has little<br/>\ninterest in coloring, drawing or painting, except as a diversion when<br/>\nshe&#39;s bored with other activities. She likes to help me cook and do<br/>\ndishes, and she&#39;s fascinated with our garden. So what do I do? My<br/>\ngut tells me to just keep her involved in what I&#39;m doing and follow<br/>\nher interests from there. We go to the library occasionally, and I<br/>\nplan to do that more often these next few months.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice is appreciated, I&#39;m glad I found this group!<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":161134106,"authorName":"Shannon","from":"&quot;Shannon&quot; &lt;ksbell@...&gt;","profile":"ksbell315","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"New member, seriously considering unschooling","postDate":"1232578972","msgId":38024,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdsODlpcytwZWl2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":38026,"prevInTime":38023,"nextInTime":38025,"topicId":38024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello all, I have a 4 year old daughter who attended a preschool for the last 1.5 years, while I finished up grad school.
