And I guess &quot;closet&quot; depends on who <br/>\nwe&#39;re &quot;closeted&quot; around.  All of my family and friends know exactly how <br/>\nwe homeschool...may not know there is a specific term for it. My <br/>\ndad &quot;gets it&quot; and we have many, many conversations.  He has taken to <br/>\npreaching on homeschooling and discipleship from an interest-led <br/>\nperspective - using real book, using real life experiences, sparking an <br/>\ninterest, etc.  It&#39;s been very exciting for me to have this connection <br/>\nwith my dad.   So I guess I just feel all closety around the homeschool <br/>\ngroup that we&#39;ve met with (meet monthly with moms and starting a <br/>\nmonthly get together for the kids - AFTER 1/2:00 so everyone can tidy <br/>\nup school).  These moms are really nice and I do think there is one who <br/>\nat least takes a more relaxed approach but she keeps shooting me the &quot;I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t say anything here&quot; looks whenever I ask how everyone <br/>\nhomeschools, what do they do, do they do everything in one big block of <br/>\ntime or do they break it up into their daily routine, etc.  I need to <br/>\nget her alone so we can have a heart to heart.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe did meet a family at the library a few weeks ago that we&#39;ve been <br/>\ngetting together with now for 2 weeks and they are great!  She only <br/>\nuses something for language arts and math and does &quot;school&quot; in under an <br/>\nhour.  So she&#39;s a lot more flexible with her time and we&#39;ve stayed out <br/>\ntogether all day.  Her 2 older girls are exactly the ages of the my <br/>\ntwo.  She asks how we do it and I tell her...just don&#39;t use the term <br/>\nunschool.  She&#39;s borrowed my Ruth Beechick books so I am kind of hoping <br/>\n(since she was open to it) that she&#39;ll get an idea or two of how to <br/>\nbreak away from the curriculum and see how to use their routine, <br/>\ninterests and daily life.  When we were together last week she asked if <br/>\nwe were going to go home and do Allie&#39;s schoolwork...I said that we <br/>\nwould definitely read (me aloud and Allie practicing her reading)before <br/>\nshe went to bed but that that WAS our &quot;school&quot;.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, she&#39;d been playing at the library (reading, computer, theme <br/>\nboxes, puzzles) the whole time we&#39;d been there.
