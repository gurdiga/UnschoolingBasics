I have a child younger<br/>\nthan yours, but I have been reading a lot of unschooling books to prepare<br/>\nmyself for the future etc.and from what I gather that children learn<br/>\nregardless of whether &#39;presented&#39; things or not. It is a child natural<br/>\ninstinct to learn things all the time.although in saying this I have read<br/>\narticles of children who go to school of have a curriculum that when<br/>\npresented with unschooling they will take a &#39;break&#39; for a while since they<br/>\nhave always been in a controlled learning environment - I guess it&#39;s there<br/>\nway of &#39;getting in touch&#39; with their instincts again.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI can highly recommend Valerie Fitzenreiter book &#39;THE UNPROCESSED CHILD -<br/>\nliving without school&#39; i think you&#39;ll find that if you read this book all of<br/>\nyour questions will be answered regarding learning etc. Valerie is/was an<br/>\nunschooling mum and goes though her challenges and every day life of<br/>\nunschooling children.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42120,"nextTopicId":42217}}
