But <br/>\nI try to at least recognize the terminology that goes with the various <br/>\ngames and such (and pointing out that there&#39;s a James Bond festival on <br/>\nAMC this week - 007 games are a favorite). And DS (7 1/2) understands <br/>\nthat certain things make me dizzy and uncomfortable. So, if he wants <br/>\nme to play, he sets it to one or two of the ones that I can manage and <br/>\nsets it for a relatively short time limit - basically he makes it <br/>\neasier for me and knows I&#39;ll likely play just that one round. Or, <br/>\nhe&#39;ll pick a game he knows I can manage (like Hot Shots Golf or <br/>\nMonopoly Party). It&#39;s still beyond me how he can be maneuvering his <br/>\ncharacter, keeping an eye on the split screens to locate opponents, <br/>\ntarget and fire accurately...all the while bouncing on his mini-<br/>\ntrampoline!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":106155453,"authorName":"Sonia","from":"&quot;Sonia&quot; &lt;soniacrane46@...&gt;","profile":"yookaysonia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"COMPUTER GAMES, DVDs, TV, entertainment.....learning from","postDate":"1136904484","msgId":8936,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRxMGhmNCs4cHUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8938,"prevInTime":8935,"nextInTime":8937,"topicId":8936,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, My son still, after 4 years u/s, plays lots of Xbox, N64 games and watches dvds, videos and tv.

I said, &#39;oh, <br/>\nwhere did you find that out from....Grandad, school....&#39; he said he <br/>\nlikes playing the computer war games, and the weapons are related to <br/>\nreal wars.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still can&#39;t play though, the hand to eye co-ordination gets to me, <br/>\nand it all leaves me rather cold, and once, when I was watching my <br/>\nelder son, I got quite queasy watching the driving.
