I went ahead and removed the post after I saw you<br/>\naccidentally posted it here Melissa...apparently I&#39;m just adding to<br/>\nthe confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really hope this discussion can lead to useful and productive<br/>\nsolutions for your local group.  Parents that have a child for whom<br/>\nhittiing or harming other children is a problem, might need to be more<br/>\naware of this issue. I know I would REALLY appreciate it if someone<br/>\nlet me know Jalen was having struggles when I was distracted.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe DOES seem to have a goal of hitting babies at times (no, this<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make him a &quot;monster&quot; on ANY level.....just something he hones<br/>\nin on very quickly as babies annoy the crap out of him) and I have to<br/>\nbe very aware in certain groups. He&#39;s doing a lot better now, but at<br/>\n4y.o. I would never have been able to turn my back for a second in a<br/>\ngroup with a baby/toddler present.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t mean leaving kids to navigate on their own.<br/>\nMindfulness takes a lot of effort and awareness.....even with other<br/>\nparents. I hope you can all find a place for positive solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"&quot;Melissa&quot; &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Mega post mega blush","postDate":"1177165925","msgId":23334,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYwZDc5NSs1YWNvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23338,"prevInTime":23332,"nextInTime":23335,"topicId":23334,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, now that I ve been outed (damn post button, i thought i hit Ren s email button), I guess I can thank you all in person for your responses.
