(Appreciate the person who posted about<br/>\nthat! :D) They were fine with that, didn&#39;t mind it.  DS8 bought<br/>\nhimself two games last time we went to GameStop.  He did the math he<br/>\nneeded and made the selective decision to buy two games instead of<br/>\njust one with the amount of money he had.  Cheers to him for making<br/>\nthat step in thinking -- It&#39;s great to notice all those little steps<br/>\nin growing and to cheer with the kids about it! :D<br/>\n<br/>\nre: the food issue -- I lost some of the original emails, especially<br/>\nthe personal ones when I had to close my pager service.  It is still a<br/>\nproblem for us because the kids want to eat different foods than I<br/>\ncan.  I&#39;m allergic to dairy so that influences some of our diet.  I<br/>\nlove Asian foods and the boys are decisively American in their tastes<br/>\n- cheeseburgers, pizza, and the like.  So we have different meals<br/>\ngoing on at once, and it&#39;s difficult keeping up my energy for that.<br/>\nLots of PB sandwiches on order sometimes.  I try to give them vitamins<br/>\nand juices to make up for their lack of green intake and offer them<br/>\nwhat&#39;s on my plate too.  They go to the food store with me and pick<br/>\nout stuff as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while they were eating cookies and candy for days on end.  I<br/>\ntried changing to a once-weekly food store trip and portioning out the<br/>\ncookies so they don&#39;t run out so fast.  Money IS tight.  But they<br/>\nlearned and slowed down a bit.  When they ask, I do offer something<br/>\nlittle more healthier WITH the sugar.  Sometimes just the cookie.<br/>\nIt&#39;s an ongoing process.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll try looking in the archives for the comments again but someone<br/>\ndid send me a great email with different suggestions that I wish I<br/>\ncould have found and carried over before service quit.  I forgot who<br/>\ndid that as well, sigh.  Would you mind resending again?? :D<br/>\n<br/>\nAdrean</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185316150,"authorName":"nrskay","from":"&quot;nrskay&quot; &lt;okmardesich@...&gt;","profile":"nrskay","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"update","postDate":"1129929174","msgId":7156,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRqYmxrbSthcW83QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31029,"prevInTime":7155,"nextInTime":7157,"topicId":7156,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Lindsay; We are so excited for you, congradulations on the wonderful news about your baby.
