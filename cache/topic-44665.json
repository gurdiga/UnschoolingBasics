We took our boys out of 2nd grade last November, and<br/>\nhave been deschooling and unschooling since then. My husband is not<br/>\ncomfortable with unschooling yet, so I agreed to sign up for a charter<br/>\nschool to calm my husband&#39;s fears while still being able to keep the kids<br/>\nhome and our marriage intact. Our &quot;teacher&quot; seems to be very helpful in<br/>\nletting us unschool, and help us translate into educationese what we are<br/>\ndoing. We will have to follow the California standards somehow, and then<br/>\ntest at the end of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo while I agree that this is not the place to discuss schools, a charter<br/>\nschool is after all a public school, I also know that many unschoolers in my<br/>\narea use charter schools because they get money for classes and educational<br/>\ntoys. This can be a help for many. And their kids are willing to put up with<br/>\nproducing some work samples and do testing in exchange for this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m hoping to achieve by going with a charter school this year, is my<br/>\nhusband&#39;s approval to NOT do it next year. I hope he will see that we don&#39;t<br/>\nneed it, and that by making our unschooling life rich and interesting they<br/>\nare learning all they need to without the external pressure of a curriculum<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t fit into our lives. This year, our boys are supposed to learn<br/>\ncursive. Well, they can barely write now. I&#39;d much rather just wait until<br/>\nthey are ready to learn it. I know they are not ready now and still it&#39;s on<br/>\nthe program for this year. That&#39;s not unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about how I can unschool and make life as good as<br/>\npossible within those limits: I can use the curriculum, or California<br/>\nstandards, as a list of things I can expose the children to, it can be like<br/>\nan idea list. In school, the kids never get through the whole thing anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to unschool, and I want/need my husband to be on board. The charter<br/>\nschool may be a detour, or a slow zone, but I hope that we eventually will<br/>\nreach our destination together!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Katrine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Aug 15, 2010 at 6:20 AM, JJ &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrossedd@...\">jrossedd@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joining a radical unschooling list to ask about your school options (for a<br/>\n&gt; six-year-old?) isn&#39;t a perfect fit for anyone, at home or online.
