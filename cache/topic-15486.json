There is a panel discussion on educational<br/>\nchoices and she has traditional school, Waldorf, Montessori, and<br/>\ngeneric hs covered. I told her I would help with unschooling - but I<br/>\ndo not think I will be comfortable representing unschooling as I have<br/>\na 4, 2 and newborn. I love to talk about it, but am not up to<br/>\ndefending how kids learn to read (etc.) without a curriculum bc I have<br/>\nnot been through that yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone in FL, planning on going to conference? I can put you in touch<br/>\nto be on the panel.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail me off list if you are interested. Thanks!<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15184,"nextTopicId":15450}}
