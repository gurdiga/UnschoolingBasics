I just thought I&#39;d share it here as well:<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;One thing that I hear again and again from parents on parenting sites,  <br/>\nneighbours etc. that really frustrates me is how children need consistency. I  <br/>\nthink many parents really confuse, children needing consistency of a life  <br/>\nstructured by parents, teachers, etc., with what I see their true need  being...... <br/>\nto feel secure. To me there is a  very big difference in  growing up feeling <br/>\nsecure in your life, (family, home, love) and growing up  under the authority <br/>\nof someone else&#39;s consistency/structure. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nReposted by<br/>\n~Kelly, because I couldn&#39;t get permission from the author---NOT that she  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t give it to me (I feel sure she would), but my e-mail to her wouldn&#39;t go  <br/>\nthrough<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2827,"nextTopicId":2831}}
