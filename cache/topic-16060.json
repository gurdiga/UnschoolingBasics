I had two that were painful; one because it went over my spine and kidney, and one because it went over an area that was seiously out of whack and I jumped anytime I was even touched there. Now it&#39;s better with chiropractic! The rest of mine have been pretty hypnotic experiences. Btw, I am petrified of needles. I hate them, even thinking about them gets me tensed and anxious. However, I have no problems with tattoos. If you have needle issues, though, get a tattoo artist who&#39;s has loads and loads of experience. They&#39;re likely to be quicker, smoother, and not as heavy of hand. The heavier the hand is, the more painful it&#39;s likely to be. Plus, that puts the ink too deep, and it fades a lot more quickly.  I use pure lanolin to heal mine. Some people do have problems with fainting when they get inked. My dh passed out twice during his first sitting, but he&#39;s been fine ever since. Our tattoo artist did say<br/>\n that it&#39;s usually the big, buff, muscled, macho guys who tend to pass out or complain about pain the most. My dh finds tats more painful than I do, also, but he has a lower pain threshold in general than I do. To me, they&#39;re very addicting, and as soon as I find the right image, I&#39;m getting my next one. I&#39;m looking for a fairy that reminds me of my son, something like a leprechaun or somesuch. If anyone knows of any pics that they think might work, let me know!<br/>\nCrystal<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Momma &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:southernbelle@...\">southernbelle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 2, 2006 8:36:59 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] RE: [unschoolingbasics) tattoos<br/>\n<br/>\n                            <br/>\n <br/>\n It hurts! But the pain is temporary and the tattoo is forever so it&#39;s worth<br/>\n it if it&#39;s important to you. I didn&#39;t have swelling afterwards but itching<br/>\n when it was healing. You shouldn&#39;t scratch but smacking it helps a lot. DO<br/>\n NOT use NEOSPORIN on it!!!!! I did cuz I ran out if the stuff they gave me<br/>\n and I had to get it redone! Neosporin heals it from the inside out and<br/>\n pushes out the ink. Use Bacitracin (sp?) only. After care is pretty simple<br/>\n and a good tattoo shop will inform you of all aftercare in writing and give<br/>\n you the stuff you will need.<br/>\n <br/>\n -Dawn<br/>\n <br/>\n Okay tattoo-ed folks, I need your real life input - just exactly <br/>\n what kind of pain is involved either during or afterward? I&#39;m a <br/>\n coward about needles in general (I can just about manage to get <br/>\n blood drawn each year to check some medical stuff but that takes <br/>\n lots of relaxing breathing just to get the needle in and there&#39;s no <br/>\n permanent marks or anything left). So, swelling afterward? <br/>\n irritation? pain (mild to severe)? etc. What kind of afterward-care <br/>\n is needed? (like with piercings that need certain types of cleansing <br/>\n and such when they&#39;re fresh)<br/>\n <br/>\n .<br/>\n <br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://geo.yahoo\">http://geo.yahoo</a> com/serv? s=97359714& grpId=12789513& grpspId=16000819 72&msgI<br/>\n d=16109&stime= 1154523466& nc1=3848530& nc2=2&nc3= 3&gt; <br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n     <br/>\n                       <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"post from anon member","postDate":"1154529334","msgId":16119,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhcWQ3bStzc24xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16118,"nextInTopic":16120,"prevInTime":16118,"nextInTime":16120,"topicId":16060,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"More from OP: ...

The only part that touches the ear is the earring, which is factory sealed and sterile. That being said, I also prefer body piercers doing the piercing, because it&#39;s healthier for your ears. With a gun, it punches through your ear, pushes the flesh to the sides, and causes scar tissue. A body piercer uses a hollow needle to &quot;core out&quot; the hole in your ear. It&#39;s much less prone to infection that way, no matter how much you clean or don&#39;t clean your piercing. ( I also used to work at a store that was getting ready to open a body piercing shop, when the location flooded. I have quite the varied work experience!) The only reason I&#39;m not taking my dd to a body piercer is because of the price. Body piercers are more expensive, but they&#39;re worth it. However, dd wants her ears pierced before she&#39;s a flower girl in my brother&#39;s wedding on Saturday, and I just don&#39;t have the money to take her to a body<br/>\n piercer right now.<br/>\nCrystal<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Michelle/Melbrigða &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 1, 2006 4:44:26 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Pierced ears WAS: post from anon member<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">                            On 8/1/06, kbcdlovejo@aol. com &lt;kbcdlovejo@aol. com&gt; wrote:<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; I have a BUNCH of single earrings (you *never* lose BOTH! &lt;g&gt;), and I<br/>\n &gt; have toyed with the idea of having another hole in one ear.

They use a needle to pierce it with.  No noise at<br/>\nall.  I think the only reason that my last one even hurt a little was that<br/>\nshe hit the cartlidge.  I didn&#39;t have a cartlidge piercing, it is just<br/>\nbeside the cartlidge, but I think she hit it.  There is definitely a dent in<br/>\nthe cartlidge on that ear.  LOL!

My grandmother was a very strict authoritarian, and I honestly don&#39;t think she liked little kids. There were a lot of rules at her house. Children were not allowed in the kitchen (which was where Grandma, my mom and aunts spent a lot of their time, btw) and we weren&#39;t allowed to touch any of the &quot;interesting&quot; things, such as a candelabra on a coffee table right at small child height. I was known as the contrary child; the one who refused to potty train, the one who pushed all the rules, the one who wouldn&#39;t share her mommy. I&#39;ve heard the stories all my life, and even remember some of them. When my grandmother told me not to lay another finger on the candles, I looked her straight in the eye, stretched out one finger, and touched. I even said, &quot;Touch.&quot; I would stand at the door to the kitchen, and slowly inch farther in, just to see how far I could get. I refused to potty train, simply because it was<br/>\n so important to everyone else, and didn&#39;t make sense to me. I didn&#39;t have a good reason to want to. i received lots more attention when I did things my way. The rules didn&#39;t make sense to me, therefore, I pushed them as far as I could. Even as a teenager and young adult, I still did that. I&#39;m trying very hard to parent my children differently.  One of the arbitrary rules as I was growing up was no ears pierced until you were 13. I took that stand for a long time myself, because it&#39;s what I was familiar with. Thanks to my lurking on this list for close to a year, after my almost 4 yo asked for the umpteenth time in several months to have her ears pierced, instead of just saying not yet, we talked about what it would involve and how we&#39;d have to care for pierced ears. She still wants them pierced, so we&#39;re going to do it later this week.  I&#39;ve learned that arbitrary rules are useless, and children understand that frequently much better than adults do. We forget so much as we<br/>\n grow up!

Sometimes it really seems that way!  with my oldest<br/>\n especially, I can stand right in front of him, look him in the eye, and<br/>\n tell him not to do something, and he will do it right in front of me. He<br/>\n has been this way for years. An example: I&#39;ll tell him not to touch his<br/>\n sister (she tends to screech lol) so he&#39;ll touch her one more time and<br/>\n then<br/>\n dart away.  Or I&#39;ll tell him not to stand on the couch so he&#39;ll do it one<br/>\n more time. This is extremely regular behavior for him. Just yesterday he<br/>\n had a giant ball and bounced it so high in the garage I was afraid he&#39;d<br/>\n take out a light bulb.  He did it again, and this time the ball hit the<br/>\n metal pieces that hold up the garage door, and popped. Trashed. And I was<br/>\n standing right there. another example, if I am laying on the bed nursing a<br/>\n sleeping baby he&#39;ll come in and I&#39;ll ask him to be quiet, he&#39;ll stand out<br/>\n of reach and hoot and/or throw something at me before he darts out of the<br/>\n room.

Aggressing behaviors are generally<br/>\ndirect and obvious. The one-up position the abuser assumes by<br/>\nattempting to judge or invalidate the recipient undermines the<br/>\nequality and autonomy that are essential to healthy adult<br/>\nrelationships. This parent-child pattern of communication (which is<br/>\ncommon to all forms of verbal abuse) is most obvious when the abuser<br/>\ntakes an aggressive stance.<br/>\n<br/>\n    * Aggressive abuse can also take a more indirect form and may even<br/>\nbe disguised and &quot;helping.&quot; Criticizing, advising, offering solutions,<br/>\nanalyzing, proving, and questioning another person may be a sincere<br/>\nattempt to help. In some instances however, these behaviors may be an<br/>\nattempt to belittle, control, or demean rather than help. The<br/>\nunderlying judgmental &quot;I know best&quot; tone the abuser takes in these<br/>\nsituations is inappropriate and creates unequal footing in peer<br/>\nrelationships. This and other types of emotional abuse can lead to<br/>\nwhat is known as learned helplessness.~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s from this website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eqi.org/eabuse1.htm\">http://eqi.org/eabuse1.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure a lot of it does not apply, but I think it&#39;s worth looking<br/>\nat.

Threats, yelling,<br/>\n&gt;cursing and anger do not support them as they grow, it only causes<br/>\n&gt;them to lose trust in their parents, themselves and their world.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know :(  I think I am much better at not threatening, but I still do<br/>\nlose<br/>\nmy temper and yell. I try to protect them from their father&#39;s verbal<br/>\nabuse,<br/>\nbut sometimes I am so frustrated with them myself that I don&#39;t, because I<br/>\njust can&#39;t get them to listen to me when they are acting so wild and<br/>\nout of<br/>\ncontrol! (but if he makes a ridiculous threat I am quick to assure<br/>\nthem its<br/>\nnot going to happen)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Not the best environment for joyful unschooling to take place.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ok. (I am not totally sold on unschooling the school stuff. I think I need<br/>\nto conquer these parenting issues before I work on that.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I suggest viewing them as perfect, beautiful human beings that are<br/>\n&gt;learning and growing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I love the way you put that, and I am trying to do that!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Obedience is not an ideal trait for an<br/>\n&gt;unschooler in my opinion. Choosing to obey a directive because it<br/>\n&gt;makes sense is one thing, blind obedience is what you&#39;re asking for<br/>\n&gt;though and that isn&#39;t honoring the child or their own intelligence.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I love the way you say that.  my oldest does know (as I have discussed it<br/>\nwith him) that he can ask why or discuss the issue.  that tends to make my<br/>\ndh irate when he does that.  but I have encouraged him. I tell him instead<br/>\nof whining or crying about it, talk to me.  ask me why. suggest an<br/>\nalternative.  I have also told the boys, if there is something you want to<br/>\ndo, come to me and ask me and I&#39;ll help you find a way to do it in an<br/>\nacceptable way. (example, a month or more ago they were outside<br/>\nplaying.....as I found out too late, they went in the garage, got unopened<br/>\nbottles of soda and water, took them out into the side yard and smashed<br/>\nthem open with baseball bats, that was some $20 worth of beverages ruined.<br/>\nyou can imagine our reactions.) I used that as an example to them, if you<br/>\nwant to do something tell me and I will help you find a way to do it that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t cause grief.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Work WITH them, not against them. They are very little boys and what<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;re doing to them today, is building a relationship with two<br/>\n&gt;teenagers and men. Treat them as the men they are going to become (as<br/>\n&gt;far as respect) while letting them be the small people they ARE.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>thank you.  I will try doing exactly that. In fact I will print that out<br/>\nand put it where I can see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for helping me!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"post from anon member","postDate":"1154442829","msgId":16074,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhbm9vZCtmcDVwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16073,"nextInTopic":16075,"prevInTime":16073,"nextInTime":16075,"topicId":16060,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... yes in part.  definitely could use the money. ... good point.

Were you with them?  Engaging<br/>\n&gt;them in an activity?  Finding something for them to do so that they<br/>\n&gt;could safely and less destructively use their energy?  A romp in the<br/>\n&gt;park, bouncing on a mattress on the floor, tumbling on said mattress,<br/>\n&gt;a gymnastics class or dance class or just a run around the block on<br/>\n&gt;their bikes or scooters (with mom joining them).  When my kids seem to<br/>\n&gt;be &quot;cluttery&quot; and restless I know that is a big signal to get out of<br/>\n&gt;the house and go somewhere.  Sometimes the park.  Sometimes the<br/>\n&gt;bookstore.  Sometimes the backyard.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this was at night, 8 or 9 p.m. although it seems like it went on for hours<br/>\nand hours so it must have started earlier.  but this kind of wildness<br/>\noften<br/>\noccurs at that hour. so going to the park wouldn&#39;t work. but the mattress<br/>\non the floor is a great idea! as for going to a class, they are in<br/>\nswimming<br/>\nlessons (this is the last week) which are first thing in the morning but<br/>\nwhatever energy they burn off in that class gets restocked quickly lol.<br/>\nthey are like the energizer bunny!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read on this list that it is ok to tell children to stop if they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are engaging in behaviors that bother other people (not in those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; words).  I was trying so hard to do that.  They will not listen to me,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; obey me, whatever word you want to use.  I ask them over and over to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You need to build trust and respect with them before you can expect<br/>\n&gt;the same back.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>yes, I understand that, and have dried to explain it to dh. (his response,<br/>\nthey don&#39;t respect anything! obviously he is a very negative person.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Yelling at them constantly to do things that annoy you<br/>\n&gt;is not the way to build trust.  What are your priorities when it comes<br/>\n&gt;to your children?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my children are my priority. they are the most important part of my life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  To your family?  How will the words you say bring<br/>\n&gt;you to a point where your children trust you and respect is mutual and<br/>\n&gt;you are joyfully living your lives?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am trying to figure that out! I don&#39;t want my kids growing up like I did<br/>\nwith an authoritarian father whose very presence in the house was like a<br/>\ndark cloud that lifted whenever he drove away. I don&#39;t want every<br/>\nbirthday,<br/>\nholiday and vacation ruined like my father ruined ours.  I want my kids to<br/>\nknow joy and happiness, to love life.  I want that so much!

I don&#39;t want them<br/>\njumping on/off the leather couches. I don&#39;t want them throwing whatever<br/>\nthey lay hands on. I don&#39;t want them eating in carpeted areas.

Has been home about 2 years now, and<br/>\nbefore<br/>\nthat was working out of town for 3 years.  So the boys have gone from one<br/>\nextreme to another regarding his presence and his negative<br/>\ncontributions to<br/>\nthe household. but I actually think I am a better parent when he is<br/>\naround,<br/>\nmaybe it just seems that way because he is worse? I take zoloft though<br/>\nwhich helps me considerably, I&#39;d be monster mommy without it.  btdt.<br/>\n(honestly my oldest would try the patience of a saint).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I&#39;m wondering if more mindful parenting could<br/>\n&gt;have prevented this accident.  Instead of saying, &quot;You many NEVER go<br/>\n&gt;into the freezer again&quot; you could just as easily say, &quot;When you need<br/>\n&gt;something from the freezer, let me know and I will help you since that<br/>\n&gt;door has problems shutting all the way.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that&#39;s a wonderful way of putting it. except knowing my boys, they would<br/>\nagree to that and then forget and open it on their own anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Or be aware of when they<br/>\n&gt;have been in the freezer.  Check it from time to time to make sure it<br/>\n&gt;is closed yourself.  Before you leave the house or go to bed.  Make it<br/>\n&gt;part of your routine.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>good idea. thanks :) I don&#39;t know why it doesn&#39;t shut all the way, it<br/>\nlooks<br/>\nlike its shut but its not, unless firmly closed.  I&#39;ll have dh check<br/>\nif its<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Do you really think that they say to themselves, &quot;Hey, I know mom told<br/>\n&gt;us not to do this, but let&#39;s see how much damage we can cause?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;Children don&#39;t think like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that regarding the freezer, but sometimes I do think that<br/>\nabout other things.  Sometimes it really seems that way!  with my oldest<br/>\nespecially, I can stand right in front of him, look him in the eye, and<br/>\ntell him not to do something, and he will do it right in front of me. He<br/>\nhas been this way for years. An example: I&#39;ll tell him not to touch his<br/>\nsister (she tends to screech lol) so he&#39;ll touch her one more time and<br/>\nthen<br/>\ndart away.  Or I&#39;ll tell him not to stand on the couch so he&#39;ll do it one<br/>\nmore time. This is extremely regular behavior for him. Just yesterday he<br/>\nhad a giant ball and bounced it so high in the garage I was afraid he&#39;d<br/>\ntake out a light bulb.  He did it again, and this time the ball hit the<br/>\nmetal pieces that hold up the garage door, and popped. Trashed. And I was<br/>\nstanding right there. another example, if I am laying on the bed nursing a<br/>\nsleeping baby he&#39;ll come in and I&#39;ll ask him to be quiet, he&#39;ll stand out<br/>\nof reach and hoot and/or throw something at me before he darts out of the<br/>\nroom.  I realize I should treat all this with humor but it is very hard to<br/>\ndo!
