It&#39;s Monday, March 14, 2005 and time for Math at ClickSchooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nRecommended Website:<br/>\nPhilTulga.com: Music Through The Curriculum<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.philtulga.com/resources.html\">http://www.philtulga.com/resources.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, THIS is a real find!  I stumbled upon this site quite by accident, and<br/>\nI&#39;m so glad I did -- you will be too!  :)  Phil Tulga is a professional<br/>\nmusician and music instructor. He has developed educational programs that<br/>\nweave music through the curriculum in almost every subject.  He presents<br/>\nthose programs to students in public and private schools in Sacramento,<br/>\nCalifornia and is available for private groups and organizations as well. As<br/>\na complement to his music programs, Phil has developed a series of FREE,<br/>\ninteractive music activities that are available at his website in math,<br/>\nscience, reading comprehension and much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you get to the site you will see a menu that includes:<br/>\n<br/>\n*MATH AND MUSIC -- Phil has taken popular math manipulatives and enhanced<br/>\nthem with rhythm and music. You&#39;ll find:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Unifix Cube Drum Machine -- This shows students how famous composers have<br/>\nused repeating patterns to create music. Students can make their own rhythm<br/>\nor drum patterns with popular Unifix cubes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Musical Fraction Bars -- Mathematicians like Pythagoras discovered that<br/>\nmusical pitches are derived from fractions. In this activity, students<br/>\ncompose and play their own songs using Musical Fraction Bars. Not only that,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll find instructions for how to build a homemade musical instrument that<br/>\nis based on these fractions.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Pattern Block Rock -- Song melodies are patterns of short and long sounds.<br/>\nIn this activity, students compose and play their own rhythmic songs using<br/>\ngeometric shapes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Fraction Pie Rhythms -- This activity shows how musical note durations are<br/>\norganized into fractions, e.g., two half notes equal one whole note. Compose<br/>\nand play your own rhythms using pie fractions instead of standard musical<br/>\nnotation.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Morse Code Music -- Listen to Phil as he plays patterns on his telephone<br/>\nusing short and long sounds. These patterns are very much like International<br/>\nMorse Code - a method of encoding each letter and number into short and long<br/>\nsounds called dots and dashes. In this activity, you can compose and play<br/>\nyour own rhythmic patterns using International Morse Code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter math, you&#39;ll find additional activities including:<br/>\n<br/>\n*HOMEMADE INSTRUMENTS -- Find directions for making your own panpipes, water<br/>\nbottle xylophone, tubular Glockenspiel, and an origami popper!<br/>\n<br/>\n*MATH, SCIENCE AND SOUND ACTIVITIES -- Explore 12 different musical<br/>\nactivities to learn about sound waves, frequencies, and even find out what<br/>\nfrequencies animals can hear.<br/>\n<br/>\n*READING COMPREHENSION -- Unbelievable as it may seem, Phil uses musical<br/>\nsound to teach sequences to improve reading skills, and he teaches<br/>\ninferences with riddles, picture puzzle predictions, and uses &quot;Peter and the<br/>\nWolf&quot; to teach musical themes and storyline components complete with story<br/>\nmaps!<br/>\n<br/>\n*READING FLUENCY -- Get Phil&#39;s tips for parents on how to encourage a love<br/>\nof reading in your child. Then, use the innovative &quot;Cucumber Pickle Machine&quot;<br/>\nto show your kids how to make rhythmic meters by combining two and three<br/>\nsyllable words!<br/>\n<br/>\n*PATTERN ACTIVITIES -- You won&#39;t believe this! Musical sequencing with<br/>\nFibonacci numbers and Pi! Not only that, play &quot;Name That Tune&quot; or learn<br/>\nabout music and the &quot;Mozart Effect.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis site gets a ClickSchooling Award for the best use of technology in<br/>\nhelping kids learn!<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane Flynn Keith<br/>\nfor ClickSchooling<br/>\nCopyright 2005, All Rights Reserved<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.Homefires.com\">http://www.Homefires.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.Carschooling.com\">http://www.Carschooling.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.UniversalPreschool.com\">http://www.UniversalPreschool.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
