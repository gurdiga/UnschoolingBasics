Does your DD remember? I&#39;m think if it was a class for 8-year-olds, it wasn&#39;t all that advanced -- no calculus textbooks required! :) <br/>\n<br/>\nVariables are no more mysterious than anything else in math. Think about doubling a recipe -- base recipe calls for 2 cups, to double means 4 cups. For every item in the recipe, X is the base recipe amount and 2X is the doubled amount. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I wonder what other things were in the &quot;quiz.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8 yo. dd is asking for &quot;math&quot; <br/>\nPosted by: &quot;Marla B.&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marla@...\">marla@...</a>   hilltowner4 <br/>\nFri Apr 6, 2007 9:02 am (PST) <br/>\nA few months ago, my 8 yo. dd went to a class on computers and at the<br/>\nbeginning the teacher quizzed the kids on their math knowledge. Being<br/>\nthe only unschooled family (all the other kids are homeschooled with<br/>\nregular work, etc.), my dd felt behind the others in this area. Now<br/>\nshe keeps bringing it up and says that she wants to know why X and Y<br/>\nare part of math, when it is about numbers not letters. She also<br/>\nfeels that she isn&#39;t as smart as the other kids who could answer the<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22884,"nextTopicId":23022}}
