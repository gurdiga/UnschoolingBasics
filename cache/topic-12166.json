It really made me think.  I know I&#39;ve VERY guilty of spending far too much time on the computer, or cleaning, and leaving my kids to play together, figuring that since they are siblings they can entertain each other.  And then when it all erupts into bickering, I get annoyed because MY LIFE has been interrupted.  How very sad of me - I&#39;m just being honest.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Kelly wrote has helped me to see what it means to unschool.  It&#39;s not about letting my children run wild and do what they want.  It&#39;s not about shirking my responsibility, but it&#39;s about embracing it.  It&#39;s about spending actual time with my children, about getting to know them like I would a friend or someone I was dating.  Unschooling is about being present with my children, and seeing them for who they are.  Not who I wish they would be, or who I want them to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this is MUCH MORE DIFFICULT than people realize.  They think unschooling is easy.  They think it&#39;s about letting your kids just &quot;go&quot;.  NO, unschooling is about being the most active parent you can possibly be.  It&#39;s about putting away the workbook that you would have your child do, and spending that time with them doing and being.  It&#39;s about playing a game and just laughing with your child - not playing a game &quot;to learn something&quot;.  It&#39;s about spending time with your child like you would spend with your best friend, or your partner - just enjoying their company.  And that&#39;s far harder to do than sending them to public school, private school, or even buying a complete curriculum.  But it&#39;s far more rewarding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so grateful for this group and the wisdom in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaisha<br/>\nhttp://www.geocities.com/maitai373/EarthSpirit.html&lt;http://www.geocities.com/maitai373/EarthSpirit.html&gt;<br/>\nhttp://khalfanifamilyadventures.blogspot.com/&lt;http://khalfanifamilyadventures.blogspot.com/&gt;<br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection.

There&#39;s a period of time (after <br/>\nleaving school or structured school-at-home) where a child needs time <br/>\nto...chill out, deprogram, unwind, get in touch with themselves, etc. <br/>\nThis may look like restlessness, boredom, etc. <br/>\nWhat type of things does he enjoy AND what type of things have you been <br/>\nsuggesting and offering to him? <br/>\nAs far as self-motivation....how long was your son in school? I believe <br/>\nthat school can squash any motivation a child has and it may take some <br/>\ntime to gain that back. My kids went through that also...school showed <br/>\nthem that learning has to be spoon fed and handed to them so when I <br/>\ntook them out of school, they sat back and waited for me to feed <br/>\nthem/teach them. Instead, I bought some cool new games and craft kits, <br/>\nbought season passes to a nature park and also to a water park right <br/>\nnear us, read with them and to them just about every day, took us all <br/>\nto get library cards and joined blockbuster online. <br/>\nNow, a year later, my girls are motivated because it&#39;s *their* life, <br/>\nand *their* thoughts and they feel free (probably for the first time in <br/>\ntheir lives-we adopted them after they had grown up in the foster care <br/>\nsystem). They want to learn because it makes their life interesting.<br/>\nLike you, we&#39;re still trying to find our way but we&#39;re really, really <br/>\nenjoying the journey. I hope it never ends. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (7), Shawna (10) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 30, 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://foreverparents.com\">http://foreverparents.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Pampered Chef Michelle","from":"&quot;Pampered Chef Michelle&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Digest Number 874 - intro/concerns...coffee , etc.","postDate":"1145290918","msgId":12203,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA0MTcwOTIxbjE3YjdmODIyczczZjFmYjY4ZTBmZTY0ZGVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMjIwMWM2NjIyZSQ1OTg4ZTgwMCQwMzAyYThjMEBCZWxraW4+","referencesHeader":"PDExNDUxOTQzNDUuMTczNC40NzgxMC5tMjdAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDQ0NDMxNzM5LjJlNGZiZDM3LjY3ZTIuNWI5ZlNNVFBJTl9BRERFREBteC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8Njg1YjJmMjA2MDQxNzA2MzVxMmUzNmI1N2V5OGFjMGY0MjYyODU2ZDcxNEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JIDwwMDIyMDFjNjYyMmUkNTk4OGU4MDAkMDMwMmE4YzBAQmVsa2luPg=="},"prevInTopic":12200,"nextInTopic":12214,"prevInTime":12202,"nextInTime":12204,"topicId":12166,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Natural limits are all around us.  They are the<br/>\n&quot;common sense&quot; things like stove burners are hot and sticking your tongue to<br/>\na metal pole during winter is not.  And yes; we do teach our children not to<br/>\nrun out in the street, but we tell them WHY they shouldn&#39;t run out into the<br/>\nstreet and then teach them how to safely cross the street or go out into<br/>\nthe street to retrieve something.  I&#39;ve witnessed countless mothers yelling<br/>\nat their children, &quot;You don&#39;t run out into the street.  Ever!&quot;  No<br/>\nexplaination.  My oldest child taught me early on that I could not have<br/>\n&quot;because I said so&quot; rules.  She would have deliberately run out into the<br/>\nstreet just to test a &quot;because I said so rule.&quot;  When she was less than 2<br/>\nyears old I learned that she needed explainations as to why things are so.<br/>\nWhen our children are near a street or in a parking lot we never say, &quot;don&#39;t<br/>\nrun out in the street&quot; we say, &quot;Look for cars.&quot;  And as parents it is our<br/>\nresponsibility to protect our children from the dangers of cars and<br/>\nstrangers and stampeding wildebeasts and to help them learn to protect<br/>\nthemselves from the dangers of cars strangers and stampeding wildebeasts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother would be a great unschooler if he would trust himself.  He rarely<br/>\ntells his daughter that there is something she can&#39;t do.  She wanted to help<br/>\nfix the roof of the church they attend after Hurricane Ivan, so my brother<br/>\ntaught her how to safely walk on the roof and what to do if she thought she<br/>\nwas losing her balance.  I think she was around 9 years old at the time.  So<br/>\nthere she was on top of the roof scampering around and pulling up old<br/>\nshingles.  Another time she wanted to swim out to a sand bar at the beach.<br/>\nRather than telling her that it was too far or too dangerous, he suggested<br/>\nthat they swim out there together.  Both of them are very good swimmers.<br/>\nLater my son wanted to go out to the sand bar.  He is not a very good<br/>\nswimmer (he&#39;s a great flailer though).  So rather than telling him no, my<br/>\nbrother got one of the small float boats we had been using, loaded my son up<br/>\non it and towed him to the sand bar which was just teeming with all kinds of<br/>\nlittle creatures.  What a great day that was for him.  He was not limited in<br/>\nwhat he wanted to do. He was provided with a safe means to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":191262975,"authorName":"Sher","from":"&quot;Sher&quot; &lt;mamasbakerybarn@...&gt;","profile":"theqponqueen","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Digest Number 874 - intro/concerns...coffee , etc.","postDate":"1145285463","msgId":12200,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjIwMWM2NjIyZSQ1OTg4ZTgwMCQwMzAyYThjMEBCZWxraW4+","referencesHeader":"PDExNDUxOTQzNDUuMTczNC40NzgxMC5tMjdAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDQ0MzE3MzkuMmU0ZmJkMzcuNjdlMi41YjlmU01UUElOX0FEREVEQG14LmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDY4NWIyZjIwNjA0MTcwNjM1cTJlMzZiNTdleThhYzBmNDI2Mjg1NmQ3MTRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":12190,"nextInTopic":12203,"prevInTime":12199,"nextInTime":12201,"topicId":12166,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"okay im curious than.  if there are no limits whatsoever, how do you keep your children from running out into the street?  from jumping off a high building or","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-943608511\">okay im curious than.  if there are no limits whatsoever, how do you keep your children from running out into the street?  from jumping off a high building or a bridge?  im thinking there has to be some limits?  i mean eventually they have to live in a society full of rules as an adult and not everyone will be able to own their own business and will probably have to work for someone else.  how will they learn they have to follow the rules to keep a job?  or even to follow the law?  what if when they are teenagers they want to experiment with illegal drugs?  and what if they do and get busted and end up in jail, the ultimate limiting experience?  i am not trying to challenge anyone, im just really curious?  i wrote a couple of weeks ago about the unschooling thing and since then i found that my son went crazy with boredom.  he just isnt the type of child to self motivate!  we are still trying to find our way.  <br/>\nsher<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Pampered Chef Michelle <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, April 17, 2006 8:35 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Digest Number 874 - intro/concerns...coffee , etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  On 4/16/06, Misty Felner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:misty@...\">misty@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; As for the coffee and food let me elaborate.

Yes I do put some limitations<br/>\non my daughter.  She&#39;s 2.5 and I feel at this age she needs guidance as to<br/>\nwhat is good for her to learn to make good decisions.  I also feel that<br/>\nrealistically in life the majority of people have limitations, things they<br/>\ncan and can&#39;t do on the job, in public, etc.  I am an unschooler not a<br/>\nradical unschooler.  When it comes to food she has been making decisions<br/>\nabout what she wants since she was 14 months old.  She knows that some foods<br/>\nhelp you grow and some don&#39;t.  She also knows which of these are acceptable<br/>\nfor her to eat and which aren&#39;t.  I never lie to her about food.  Carob<br/>\nchips are candy to her b/c that&#39;s what she compares it to.  When she asks to<br/>\ntaste something generally we let her.  For example last Halloween we took<br/>\nher trick or treating.  She didn&#39;t know what candy was, all she understood<br/>\nwas that it was something the older kids (trick or treaters that came to our<br/>\ndoor) coveted.  She played with the few pieces of candy she got and when she<br/>\nfinally got one open she took a few licks and that was that.  She&#39;s never<br/>\nasked for candy again, but she knows it&#39;s something you shouldn&#39;t eat often<br/>\nbecause it doesn&#39;t help you grow.  BTW we handed out pretzels not candy.  I<br/>\nam aware that the forbidden fruit is always the most tempting so when she<br/>\nasks I generally allow a small taste.  But there are things we consume that<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel are appropriate for 2.5 you may disagree and that is your<br/>\nchoice.  My daughter didn&#39;t start drinking juice until she was close to 2.<br/>\nWe never offered and she never asked.  When she did decide she wanted to<br/>\ntaster ours we let her.  Coffee and soda I just don&#39;t feel are appropriate.<br/>\nThat&#39;s my opinion others can do as they see fit for their kids.  Those of<br/>\nyou who responded that I&#39;m limiting her freedom by not letting her taste it<br/>\nwould you also let your child have a sip of your margarita (at 2.5) and if<br/>\nyour child decided they liked it what then.  Maybe you feel it&#39;s okay for a<br/>\nchild of that age to have a taste of coffee, alcohol, soda, whatever if it&#39;s<br/>\nonly a taste and not very often I don&#39;t, and I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m limiting her<br/>\nfreedom by not allowing her to taste it, nor do I feel I&#39;m doing any harm by<br/>\nexplaining to her the reason why it&#39;s ok for me to have it not her.  Maybe<br/>\nit&#39;s not a good example of me, but it also shows that there are times it&#39;s<br/>\nokay to have things you want even when they&#39;re not the best for you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce wrote: <br/>\nWhat you&#39;re doing is creating a mystique about coffee (as people  <br/>\noften do about alcohol).
