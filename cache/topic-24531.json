I am new to <br/>\nthis whole unschooling thing after trying to do school at home only <br/>\nbetter for a few years. With my 13 yr old it is harder to keep me <br/>\nand him out of the &quot;what am I learning today&quot; mindset and realizing <br/>\nthat life is learning. With the two girls I completely see <br/>\nunschooling flourish because they have no &quot;school&quot; training. They <br/>\nlearn at 6am or 10pm in all they do they learn and experience and so <br/>\nwith them I see it happening. It is hard but easy to move from <br/>\nconventional to unconventional parenting but the sooner you start <br/>\nthe easier it becomes. I find myself saying &quot;why not&quot; a lot. My <br/>\nyoungest daughter has been so strong willed that I had to change in <br/>\norder to save her precious spirit. The girls now say &quot;team work&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;working it out&quot; often and while they are worst enemies and best <br/>\nfriends it is all okay. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jennifer Barber <br/>\n&lt;graphophiliac@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Julie,<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;   Thanks so much for your response.
