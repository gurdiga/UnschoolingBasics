I have a  <br/>\nlot of trouble sleeping right now, and part of it is that I am a  <br/>\nnight owl. I start to recover consciousness around noon, and come  <br/>\nalive by 3pm. I love my time after 6pm, and usually cannot sleep  <br/>\nbefore midnight. I prefer around 2am. My dad has been a third shift  <br/>\nworker my entire life, he has consistently chosen jobs in which he  <br/>\ncould (nurse, graphic designer, artist, webpage designer). For the  <br/>\nfirst time ever, tonight, my stepmom compared our childhood, neither  <br/>\nof us ever slept as children at night. I didn&#39;t know that about him!  <br/>\nIt&#39;s so funny, because really, as a teenager I didn&#39;t desire to sleep  <br/>\nmore at night, I just became rebellious enough against my mom (she  <br/>\nhad primary custody) to fight it. I think maybe that&#39;s the  <br/>\ndifference, I was finally &#39;big&#39; enough to not be told I have to be in  <br/>\nbed by 9pm. I think a lot of times that&#39;s where the myth comes in.<br/>\n<br/>\nJosh and Emily are night people. They stay up with me, and often way  <br/>\nafter me. They sleep in. They are happy. Rachel and Sam are both kids  <br/>\nthat know their needs, and go to bed earlier. They also get up at the  <br/>\nbuttcrack o&#39; dawn....hence my problem NOW with the lack of sleep. I  <br/>\ngo to bed around 2am, and I&#39;m up at 6am. Sigh....someday I&#39;ll get to  <br/>\nsleep. lol!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut someone told me last week that I&#39;m &#39;allowing my kids to learn  <br/>\ndysfunctional behavior&#39;. I said, &quot;You have got to be kidding!

Not your<br/>\ntypical newborn &quot;confused about night and day&quot; type night owl, but truly a<br/>\nnight owl.  Did her best sleeping from about 3am to 10am (if she was allowed<br/>\nto).  I fought that for so many years, trying to get her to conform to a<br/>\n&quot;normal&quot; schedule.  Her creativity starts sparking at around midnight. She<br/>\ndoes her best writing at that hour.  She&#39;ll crawl into bed around 3 am or<br/>\nsometimes as late as 5 am.  If there is somewhere she wants to go the next<br/>\nday she will decide whether or not to go to bed earlier or whether to live<br/>\nwithout rested sleep (or decide in the morning not to go.)  And I&#39;m fine<br/>\nwith that ....... now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Elayne is probably the one that I would say is most to the societal<br/>\nnorm.  She goes to bed around 11:30 or so and is up by 8 or 8:30 usually.<br/>\nShe&#39;s always been that way.  From birth.  When she was a baby past when she<br/>\nweaned at 3, I used to joke that her lulla-bye was the theme music to Star<br/>\nTrek: Deep Space Nine as that was when she did her big &quot;sleepy nursing&quot; each<br/>\nnight.  It played in reruns after the news each night and by 10:35 she was<br/>\nout!<br/>\n<br/>\nKeon is a morning person.  He is up with the sun whether he has had 3 hours<br/>\nof sleep or 10 hours of sleep.  He does his best thinking at that time of<br/>\nthe day, can conquer obstacles, solve problems, and can be talked to about<br/>\nthings that might be upsetting him in his life best from 5am to about 10am.<br/>\nHe also has been like that since he was a baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was rough for a few years when I had one that I was &quot;fighting with&quot; past<br/>\nmidnight and another that was up at the crack of dawn wanting my attention.<br/>\nHOw I wish I had had the ability to trust that Emily would get the sleep she<br/>\nneeded and staying up with Daddy was an ok thing rather than the tears we<br/>\nboth shed so many nights over &quot;needing to go to sleep&quot; and &quot;not being<br/>\ntired.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nToo bad we don&#39;t live in a society that honors that people have different<br/>\ncycles sometimes at different times in their lives.  I can much more relate<br/>\nto Keon&#39;s cycles than Emily&#39;s because I used to not be able to sleep if the<br/>\nsun was up.  Even today if I wake up and recognize that the sun is up my<br/>\nbrain sends a signal that it is time to wake up.  I sometimes wonder if the<br/>\nmoon has the same effect on Emily.

But it seems that *most* <br/>\nteens DO change their clocks to more of a night owl schedule somewhere <br/>\naround puberty. Someone speculated on another list a couple of weeks <br/>\nago that maybe teens were the ones who had &quot;guard duty&quot; eons ago! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I saw it first hand with my now 18 year old. He was an <br/>\nup-with-the-dawn kid up until puberty.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, he estimates how much rest he may need for the following day&#39;s <br/>\nactivities.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son and I are both morning people.  I can&#39;t remember not being<br/>\non -- even as a teen, and my son, at 14, still is, and has been<br/>\nsince more or less birth.  (He used to cluster feed and then conk<br/>\nout for his &quot;long&quot; (2.5 hours, vs 2...) sleep of the night at 8pm<br/>\nfrom when he was a newborn.  He used to deny that he was a morning<br/>\nperson, but a few months ago, finally realized that if he wants to<br/>\nsuccessfully figure out a problem in a game, he is far better off if<br/>\nhe does it in the morning than at 9 at night!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve fluctuated throughout my life. Sometimes up really, really <br/>\nearly---like now, at 6:00am. Sometimes staying up late---&#39;til 2-3:00 <br/>\nand sleeping until noon.<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron (18), even as a newborn, would wake at 7:00, eat, go back to <br/>\nnap from 9-11:00. Wake up, eat, play, back down for a nap from 1-4:00. <br/>\nWake, eat, play, go back to bed at 7:00pm and sleep straight through <br/>\nexcept to roll over to nurse until 7:00am. Like clockwork---two naps <br/>\n(totalling 5 hours!) and a 12 hour night every day! He still needs a <br/>\nminimum of 10 hours every night---often taking an afternoon nap. Duncan <br/>\n(10) has always needed less sleep. He can already get by with 8-9 <br/>\nhours/day.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also realize that when they hit puberty (and my son hasn&#39;t<br/>\nyet), bodies go through big changes, and the sleep need generally<br/>\nincreases.  For those with teens, have you seen changes in sleep<br/>\npatterns?  Particularly if you have/had a morning person kid?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nYes. Cameron needed LOTS more sleep (hard to believe, huh? &lt;g&gt;). We <br/>\njoked that, like a toddler, he was growing so fast that he slept <br/>\nthrough puberty! Before, he would be up with the sun, every morning. <br/>\nAnd he would sleep when it was dark, so he slept more in winter than in <br/>\nsummer. At puberty, he wrapped his schedule so that he was asleep <br/>\nalmost all day, and up just a few hours/night.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s 18 now, and just said yesterday that he felt he needed to try for <br/>\nanother hour or so each night. The cool thing is that he KNOWS what he <br/>\nneeds sleep-wise because he has figured out what feels right and what <br/>\nfeels off.

Jared snuggles up on the couch near my <br/>\ncomputer, tells me he&#39;s cold and wants a blanket, and then BAM, he&#39;s <br/>\nout!  But for some reason that night he just wanted to go to bed.  This <br/>\nis just one example of how DH and I differ on the kids.  Jared is also a <br/>\ncomputer and gaming freak (in a good way) at 5.  My DH made him into one <br/>\n(we both have our own computers, I demanded DH build one for Jared when <br/>\nhe was 18mo because he was constantly on mine ~ lol), and he also <br/>\ninsisted we get a Playstation 2 for him for Christmas when I asked to <br/>\nget him a V-Smile.  Now DH complains because Jared spends all of his <br/>\ntime either on his Playstation or on his computer playing games.  <br/>\nJared&#39;s obviously learning lots from these games, and he&#39;s also starting <br/>\nto get his fill as I can entice him outside now, where before he <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t go at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned from this list to just let him play his games and not get <br/>\nuptight about it.  I&#39;ll tell Jared that I&#39;m taking Chase outside and he <br/>\ncan come if he wants.  He just says, &quot;Okay,&quot; and then in about 10 <br/>\nminutes he&#39;s coming out the door to play a little outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and DH&#39;s passions keep him on the computer all the time too, so I <br/>\njust find it ironic that he gets upset about Jared being on the computer <br/>\nso much ~ lol<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I think I&#39;m turning this message into more than it was supposed to <br/>\nbe about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKristie<br/>\n<br/>\nRen Allen wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Can you snuggle up with him when he&#39;s sleepy and wait until he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; almost totally out before taking him in the room?

And I&#39;m applying things learned here to my life and <br/>\nI&#39;m enjoying my kid&#39;s so much more!!  I&#39;m glad this isn&#39;t a traditional <br/>\n&quot;support&quot; list.  I need someone to challenge my actions and my way of <br/>\nthinking.  I&#39;m SO EXCITED about unschooling my boys (almost 5 and <br/>\n17mo).  I so wish I had found this list when I was pressured into <br/>\nputting my oldest in preschool.  I had to fight with Jared every school <br/>\nmorning to get him to go.  After I found this list, I was able to <br/>\njustify why I should take him out of preschool and I did it!  He hated <br/>\nit, it wasn&#39;t a good fit for him (he&#39;s very spirited, very active, and <br/>\nsitting at tables just does not work for him), he&#39;s a night owl and I <br/>\ncould barely get him up in the mornings to go.  So now, he&#39;s home and <br/>\nit&#39;s tougher for me, but I&#39;m learning to enjoy him and what HE enjoys.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, a big THANK YOU to the list owners for this list and challenging me <br/>\non a daily basis to live my life joyfully!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my question:  My oldest son, Jared, is a night owl like me.  My <br/>\nDH is an early to bed, early to rise kind of guy.  My second son is more <br/>\nlike my DH.  He likes to get up early.  So, the past couple of nights <br/>\nJared and I have been up really late (much later than normal), past <br/>\nmidnight.  I don&#39;t have a problem with it, but my DH does.  Jared has <br/>\n*always* been like this, from the day he was born, so it&#39;s nothing new <br/>\naround here.  Of course, the other guys my DH works with have kids that <br/>\nwere Ferberized and go to bed at 7pm every night.  Well, that approach <br/>\ndidn&#39;t fly in this house and it never will.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the other night I was working late, Jared was up with me and at <br/>\n12:30am he finally said to me, &quot;Mom, it&#39;s time to go to bed.&quot; (We all <br/>\nsleep in the same room.  Jared sleeps in a crib sidecarred to our bed, <br/>\nand Chase sleeps in bed with us since he still nurses at night).  So, I <br/>\nwas tired too, so we closed up shop and headed to bed.  Jared is loud <br/>\n(talks loud, walks loud, even though he&#39;s barely 30lbs).  I reminded <br/>\nJared to be quiet and not wake up Daddy and Chase, but Daddy woke up <br/>\nanyway and looked at me and said angrily, &quot;It&#39;s 12:30, why is he still <br/>\nup?!!&quot;  I said, we&#39;re going to bed now. So, DH starts up on his, &quot;he&#39;s <br/>\nhyped up on sugar,&quot; rant.  Well, no, he wasn&#39;t hyped up on sugar, and I <br/>\ntold him so.  I said,&quot;He&#39;s not like you, he&#39;s a night owl like me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, how do I respond respectfully to my DH without biting his head off, <br/>\nlike I&#39;d like to do, and I sometimes do?  I&#39;ve sent him links on <br/>\nunschooling.  I&#39;ve sent him the links to Sandra Dodd&#39;s page, Joyce&#39;s <br/>\npage, the unschooling discussion board and links to some other <br/>\narticles.  I know he said what he did out of frustration, out of being <br/>\nawakened by a loud child, rather than me carrying an asleep child to <br/>\nbed.  This has been an ongoing struggle with us.  Sure, I&#39;d like for <br/>\nJared to go to bed earlier than his normal 10:30 ~ 11pm, but he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve made peace with it.  My DH doesn&#39;t bother to help with <br/>\nany kind of &quot;bedtime routine,&quot; and the only time I can get my paid work <br/>\ndone is when Chase is sleeping, so I can&#39;t help Jared slow down at <br/>\nnight.  He&#39;s just one of those kids who talks from the time he wakes in <br/>\nthe morning till the minute he drops off to sleep.  If we make him go to <br/>\nbed before he&#39;s ready, lie down with him until he falls asleep, then he <br/>\ntosses/turns/talks until he drops off (which usually ends up being <br/>\naround 10:30 pm anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA,<br/>\nKristie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13098,"nextTopicId":13149}}
