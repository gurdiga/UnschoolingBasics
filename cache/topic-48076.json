It may not feel like that every day but you are heading in the direction of more connections and a happier life together. <br/>\n<br/>\nScreaming is one way to get attention and the littles may not have learned yet, or trust, that you are really there as much as they need. So they scream for attention. That&#39;s what they&#39;ve learned to do and it works. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you meet their screams with a normal/quiet voice (hard to do, I know -- but try not to yell over each other) that can lead to responses at normal/quiet levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you have a full house.

Learning to be proactive, instead of reactive will head off the screaming before it starts - in fact, the biggest, most important parenting &quot;trick&quot; you can learn (whether you continue unschooling or not) is to be more proactive. It takes time and practice to get the hang of it, though! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Is there anything more I can do to cut down on the noise level?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Something else to consider is if some of the kids - the little ones, especially - are going through a stage where they need to use their big muscles a lot. Screaming uses the big muscles of the chest, back and abdomen as well as moving a lot of oxygen around - so if the kids aren&#39;t getting enough big body movement in general, screaming is going to be really attractive as a way to meet some basic physical needs. Getting them out to run around can help - and getting them out also lets the little ones scream without breaking any eardrums ;) If the weather isn&#39;t amenable, though, you can also do things like blow bubbles and blow up balloons so the kids can use some of those big muscles in ways which don&#39;t drive you out of your mind. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237699340,"authorName":"messy_boys","from":"&quot;messy_boys&quot; &lt;messy_boys@...&gt;","profile":"messy_boys","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"New to unschooling and ? on littles","postDate":"1332520279","msgId":48076,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpraThnbitsYWVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48077,"prevInTime":48075,"nextInTime":48077,"topicId":48076,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello all, I started looking into unschooling a while back (maybe a year ago?), but eventually I let fear take back over and back to the workbooks we went.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-578623787\">Hello all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI started looking into unschooling a while back (maybe a year ago?), but eventually I let fear take back over and back to the workbooks we went.
