The teachers that have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-697111087\">Our story is another that happened while dad was away..... ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\nTristan has always struggled at school, not academically but socially.  The teachers that have taken the time to get to know Tristan really seemed to appreciate his personality (his perceptiveness, excitement towards many topics, sense of humor, etc.).  They did have a rough time with him since he would finish his work so quickly and then end up getting in trouble because he was bored. His second grade teacher, when asked how we could help at home, told us &quot;Well certainly don&#39;t teach him anything new at home!&quot;  Tristan is also really sensitive and reacts badly to any sort of joking/teasing/etc.  His strong reactions would end up getting him in trouble, yet the person doing the teasing would not be reprimanded.  Tristan would see the injustice in this and then react to that...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband left for Iraq three days prior to Tristan starting third grade.  School was a nightmare.  I won&#39;t go into all the details but we had two months in school go by and didn&#39;t hear any negatives from the school (yet I heard negative things from Tristan on a daily basis).  The out of the blue the school was demanding interventions and started doing whatever they could to get Tristan labeled with something.  Everyday got worse and worse....Tristan would be in bed crying at night saying that everyone at school thought something was wrong with him.  I even ended up taking Tristan to a psychologist who found nothing wrong and was working with him on COPING TACTICS for school.  *sigh*  His teacher was a mean and vile person.  The school loved to use shaming tactics and would use his dad against him (&quot;How do you think your dad, who is far away in Iraq, would feel if he knew you did such and such?&quot;).  Tristan&#39;s world revolves around Jody, and he was simply devastated when they said that type of thing to him.  I was incensed.  Pamela&#39;s story about visiting the ps for her child really hit close to home...that is what I saw at Tristan&#39;s school.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy mid-November I started researching homeschooling on the internet.  I know a few folks that homeschool, but they stick rigidly to curriculums and schedules.  I knew this wouldn&#39;t work for Tristan and I.  Our relationship was already strained, and me becoming the &quot;teacher&quot; would only make it worse.  I quickly came across unschooling, and I was hooked.  I checked out &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; and one of John Holt&#39;s books from the library and bought several more from Amazon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI emailed Jody and asked him what his thoughts were about homeschooling.  I had kept him informed about the problems at school.  He was all for homeschooling but was concerned because I would be taking it on alone.  I ensured him that Tristan and I would be fine, and I withdrew Tristan on Dec 1st of last year.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, Jody and I haven&#39;t had much of a chance to discuss unschooling, since our communication is quite limited; it is incredibly difficult to really have an indepth discussion of unschooling (the theory behind it, what a typical day would look like, etc.) through email.  I did recently send him a lengthy email discussing the basics of it.  I think he may be taken aback for a short time since it is such a dramatic shift away from the norm, but I now he&#39;ll quickly realize that this is the environment that Tristan will truly flourish in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat ended up being much longer than I meant it to be...my apologies!<br/>\n<br/>\nMalinda<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nomadicdreamers.blogspot.com/\">http://nomadicdreamers.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183015595,"authorName":"Mother Earth (Tyra)","from":"&quot;Mother Earth &#92;(Tyra&#92;)&quot; &lt;motherspirit@...&gt;","profile":"breastisbesttn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Your Unschooling Story please...","postDate":"1137858098","msgId":9454,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNmQwMWM2MWVhMSQyYjVjYWU2MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDAwMWMwMWM2MWU0YyQzNDQ2MmQ4MCQ2NDAxYThjMEB0aWJlcml1bT4gPGFlMjZhNTcxMDYwMTIxMDcxNGoxYzU1ZGFkNXJlYzYzNWVjZmI1NjAyYTgyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9452,"nextInTopic":9478,"prevInTime":9453,"nextInTime":9455,"topicId":9430,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I love your story.

I agree with Kelly, it is helpful if the partner is out of  town!<br/>\n <br/>\nI got interested in alternative education because my son was different (in  <br/>\nshorthand, autistic spectrum....but we didn&#39;t know that then) and I knew he  <br/>\nneeded much more than the typical preschool experience (because we thought he  <br/>\nhad to go, of course).  So, he went to Montessori preschool for two years,  one <br/>\nyucky year and one great year.  I learned a lot about Montessori and  read a <br/>\nbook or two.<br/>\n <br/>\nThen we were due to move again, my DH was in Afghanistan, and we  could not <br/>\nafford the Montessori school in our new town.  Plus, my  experiences taught me <br/>\nthat just like everything else, it depended on the  teacher, the school&#39;s <br/>\nideals and indeed the other parents and students what type  of experience my son <br/>\nwould have.  It had very little to do with Montessori,  in my opinion.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, I started reading H/S books in the bookstore and talked online to some  <br/>\npeople that I knew from a parenting message board I was on.

The rest has been  a <br/>\nslow and definitely not straight progression of his understanding.

And he notices that ours are happy and  interested <br/>\nin life and all the other schooled kids are really difficult to  be around.  <br/>\nHe is starting to see that other people judge their children on  what they are <br/>\nor are not achieving and seem to care more about the profession  they will <br/>\nbecome than who they are as people. So he knows we are doing something  right, <br/>\nbut he isn&#39;t exactly a supporter.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, he attended bits and pieces of the second Live and Learn Conference and  <br/>\ntwo years later said &quot;that was and UNschooling conference?????&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nKelly, maybe Paul and Ben should go on a long, long bike ride.

We&#39;re not rich but we do manage to support the <br/>\nfive of us and two pets on his one income. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a blog post about why we decided to take out kids out of <br/>\nschool. I&#39;ll copy it here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;My husband & I decided to homeschool our three children about a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>year and a half after we adopted them. At first, it was something I <br/>\nwas curious about because it was different. I&#39;ve always enjoyed <br/>\nexposing myself to, and experiencing, things that are off the beaten <br/>\npath and I found myself being drawn to the unschooling philosophy. I <br/>\nbegan doing a lot of researching on homeschooling in general, it&#39;s <br/>\ndifferent methods and found out what the laws were for my state. <br/>\nBilly & I started meeting with other homeschooling families and we <br/>\nwere confident that we could do this. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the time of our adoption, they were 5, 8 & 11. We adopted three <br/>\nchildren, siblings that had been in foster care for fours years.. <br/>\nAfter about a year, I started to feel as if we had hit a plateau in <br/>\nterms of bonding as a family. Sure, we knew which of us was not a <br/>\nmorning person (Shawna & I), which of us didn&#39;t like eggs (Cimion & <br/>\nJacqueline) and who could be counted on for remembering directions <br/>\n(Billy & Cimion), but I wanted more for us. I felt that we needed to <br/>\nstart bonding on a deeper, emotional level. There were emotional <br/>\nissues that needed more private family time in which to be <br/>\naddressed. I knew we couldn&#39;t accomplish that with them being away <br/>\nfrom us for 35 hours a week at school. <br/>\nAnd it didn&#39;t end there. After school hours, there was homework that <br/>\nneeded to be done and tests to be studied for and teachers to meet <br/>\nwith and over priced candy to sell. School seemed to have a way of <br/>\ncreeping into our personal lives and stealing our family time. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, over a four month period, we removed them, one at a time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been a year since we removed our first child and the benefits <br/>\nof un/homeschooling (and also being free of the school system) <br/>\ncontinue to have a tremendous positive impact on our family. We <br/>\nwould never have come as far as we have if our children were still <br/>\nin school.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI unschooled them from the start. <br/>\nRemoving them from school, saved them but unschooling makes it <br/>\npossible for them to heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has always been on board with whatever I wanted to do. He <br/>\ntrusts my judgement and has a lot of faith in my choices. <br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (7), Shawna (10) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 30, 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Christy Putnam&quot; <br/>\n&lt;personal_balance@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Which parent chose to unschool in your home, was it a mutual <br/>\n </span></blockquote>decision before<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; having kids, was it something you stumbled upon while researching<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling and it just resonated with one of you, if it was not <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a mutual<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; decision, how did you explain it to your SO or convince them, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>basically what<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; is your story of how unschooling became a part of your life?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Christy Putnam<br/>\n&gt;  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance\">http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance\">http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Independent Executive<br/>\n&gt; Discover a way to increase<br/>\n&gt; your health and/or income! &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://practicalsolution.info/\">http://practicalsolution.info/</a>&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://practicalsolution.info\">http://practicalsolution.info</a> <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Go confidently in the direction of your dreams.<br/>\n&gt; Live the life you have always imagined.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; - Henry David Thoreau<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Your Unschooling Story please...","postDate":"1137852001","msgId":9441,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDN0VDQUExQjIzRDI2Mi0xMUM0LTM2MURARldNLU0xMi5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMWMwMWM2MWU0YyQzNDQ2MmQ4MCQ2NDAxYThjMEB0aWJlcml1bT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMWMwMWM2MWU0YyQzNDQ2MmQ4MCQ2NDAxYThjMEB0aWJlcml1bT4="},"prevInTopic":9437,"nextInTopic":9442,"prevInTime":9440,"nextInTime":9442,"topicId":9430,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

A good student. I was heavily involved as room mom, was on the parents&#39; <br/>\nboard, and volunteered in the Resource Room. At the last parent&#39;s board meeting April of sixth grade, <br/>\nit was decided (against my protests) that the children needed MORE computer time and less art/music/drama.<br/>\nThat was the last straw. But Cameron had already complained about the arbitrariness of grades (which didn&#39;t <br/>\nkick in at this school until fifth grade) and all the bullying bychildren and teachers. We had discussed <br/>\nhomeschooling since the end of January, but had decided to just ride out the year.<br/>\n <br/>\nCameron suggested it in January. In February, while Ben was OOT for rwo weeks, I got every book at the <br/>\nlibrary on homeschooling. I ordered every curriculum catalogue. I read and researched and talked with <br/>\nclients and friends that homeschooled. When Ben got home, I said that I thought we needed to homeshcool <br/>\nthe boys. I had a HUGE pile of research and Q&A and books and ...I WAS PREPARED! For battle! &lt;g&gt; I had <br/>\nevery answer to every argument he could throw at me. <br/>\n <br/>\nHe said, &quot;OK. I trust you.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nShit!   All that work.... &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nBut he added that he wasn&#39;t sure how we were going to pay for TWO boys to go to private school. He hoped <br/>\nthis would work.<br/>\n <br/>\nI discovered John Holt pretty quickly. Realized that *this* man had a clue, found the unschooling.com <br/>\nmessage boards, and was an unschooling mom. Well, the idea clicked right away. The process to BE an <br/>\nunschooling mom took longer.<br/>\n <br/>\nBen still expected things to look more schooly---more educational. I tried to have a few schoolish examples <br/>\nfor him each week. Then I gave him Mary Griffith&#39;s book, The Unschooling Handbook, while he was again OOT. <br/>\nOne day he called home and told me to quit making them do anything schoolish---THAT wasn&#39;t unschooling! <br/>\n&lt;bwg&gt; It took him a little longer, but he got it! Thank you, Mary Griffith!<br/>\n <br/>\nNow Ben&#39;s just as vocal as I am about it.

It&#39;s been awhile since I wrote it all out.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We came to homeschooling when Will was 16 and in 10th grade at public school.  One day I got a call from a teacher, asking if Will was okay because they hadn&#39;t seen him in class in 15 days!  Yes, 3 weeks and this was the first I&#39;d heard of it.  We&#39;d been driving him to school every morning, and he&#39;d been leaving right after we drove away -- off to hang out with friends.  It was the first week of May, 2001.  We had just pre-registered Andy (then 5) for KG in mid-April -- earlier than we&#39;d planned, urged on by the arrival of Dan (in Jan 01) and my mil who insisted Andy was ready for school, even at only 5.  She had wintered with us for two months while I was on bedrest with Dan&#39;s pregnancy, and prepped Andy for school-life then. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Will asked to homeschool -- left me no choice, really -- so I bought him a GED prep book and left him to study at his own pace while I learned about homeschooling.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  The summer came and went -- while Andy spent 6 wks alone in Hawaii with the inlaws.  I took Dan to LaLeche meetings, where I met a few homeschoolers.  Andy came home from Hawaii and mil stayed a week.  That entire week I was seized with a sense of complete dread about school for Andy. She talked about how much he could look forward to it non-stop it seemed (she&#39;s a retired K teacher). I just couldn&#39;t see myself doing it, giving the schools another of my children to damage, with me as their agent in that misery.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My mil left one week before school was to start for Andy.  That same night, I told Gary(dh) how I was feeling and asked if we could just go back to our original schedule (Andy&#39;s a June baby, we&#39;d always figured we&#39;d wait until he was 6) and try homeschooling for one year.  If it didn&#39;t work, fine, I&#39;d find some way to send him the next year.  He agreed!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  When I called the school to tell them we&#39;d decided to wait a year (thinking it would be no big deal, after all he&#39;s our child) I found it was easier to become a homeschooler, than to be granted &#39;permission&#39; to keep a 5yo home from school -which actually requires approval from a board/committee of some sort!  So, we went on record as homeschooling Andy, and I found a homeschooling support group for us to hang out with.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Within only a few months, we had decided never to send Andy or Dan to school, but I still thought we needed a curriculum to school at home.  I tried Charlotte Mason, Five in a Row, explored Waldorf, and tried to pull together my own eclectic plan.  Nothing really felt right.  In the fall of 2002, I heard Sandra Dodd talk about unschooling and found myself thinking &quot;oh my god, I&#39;m one of those people&quot;  and it scared the daylights out of me!  It felt like working without a net.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  By April of 2003, Will had left home (along with my Mom, consuming much of my time from Feb - April) and Andy was starting to read -- from words he&#39;d seen on cartoons, and I was amazed at how much he learned in those two months when I was too busy to &#39;do school.&#39;  I began to feel comfortable with the idea of unschooling and spent as much time as I could at unschooling.com.  I didn&#39;t say anything to Gary then about unschoooling -- I was worried he wouldn&#39;t agree -- we just relaxed and got thru summer (a month-long family visit to the inlaws in Hawaii).  When we returned, we had an email from his parents -- full of concerns for how much Andy was missing and should be in school.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Gary and I spent 3 days drafting, rewriting, and editing our reply -- it started out 6 pages long, finally down to 3 (printed in email).  In that, we both made a strong case for how much school had damaged us, and our intent to have more for our children.  By the end of it, we&#39;d landed happily together into unschooling, tho it&#39;s not a word we&#39;ll ever use with his parents -- my Mom knows we unschool, but no other family have heard that from us.  As an extremist myself -- always an all or nothing gal -- we quickly became radical unschoolers, anything less being just not enough.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  It&#39;s been a good journey for us, and we&#39;ve both grown and learned so much about each other as people and as parents.  We still find new things out - for example, just a couple of days ago when my sister asked &quot;Is Dan reading?&quot; I answered &quot;Oh god, no -- not yet, but he&#39;s close&quot;  Gary&#39;s answer was &quot;Yes, he reads -- he has a lot of sight recognition words.&quot;  Just one of those moments when I&#39;m reminded that he gets it more than I do sometimes.  And the boys, of course, are thriving.  <br/>\n  <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Mom to Will (21 next weekend) Andy (9) & Dan (5 in just 4 days!) <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
