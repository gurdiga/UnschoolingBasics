That&#39;s not just a way to say that all subjects will be covered in due course; that&#39;s saying bits & pieces get picked up by kids all the time, with everything they&#39;re doing, and we can&#39;t say what bits and pieces will get used when or where or for what purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, you don&#39;t even needs games about words or letters or spelling to provide an environment or experience for learning about reading. (as long as you&#39;re living in a print-rich environment, which most of us reading here do)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be that in a story you&#39;re telling about something a friend said, you&#39;ll use a word he&#39;s seen written before, and didn&#39;t know, and he&#39;ll make the connection that those letters he saw on the page make that word you just said. It&#39;s probable he won&#39;t even be aware he&#39;s made that connection, he&#39;ll just be able to read that word when he sees it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nSinging a song might do more to help him read than reading a book will, at a particular time. Having the time and space for those bits & pieces to come together as they will, can be more helpful than trying to cram more bits & pieces in there. Time to daydream and BE and think freely and explore what makes him happy and what he&#39;s interested in gives him the freedom for those bits & pieces to connect & bounce off each other & reconnect & form new thoughts in a way that works best for HIM, which may look nothing like spelling or reading games. It might look more like building with Legos or beating a level on a video game - even one without written dialogue on the screen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when Seth was very young, maybe one or so, we went to a restaurant with my dad, and they had a Pepsi machine. Seth saw it and starting singing, &quot;Ba da bap ba ba&quot;, the theme to the Pepsi commercials then. That - him seeing the commercial, and making the connection of the song to the Pepsi logo - had as much to do with him learning to read as reading books to him did.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo play the games if they&#39;re fun, but don&#39;t think those games are more necessary to learning to read than him listening to music he likes on his iPod, or just staring out the window, watching the scenery go by, or having a conversation with you about something a friend said.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nCaren<br/>\n(very cute Pepsi commercial - <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7R-bR0cW8c)\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7R-bR0cW8c)</a></div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/h7R-bR0cW8c?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Reading ideas","postDate":"1318975743","msgId":47575,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo3a3RkditmaHZjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGo3azU5YStnbWUzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47573,"nextInTopic":47577,"prevInTime":47574,"nextInTime":47576,"topicId":47531,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ***************** It might help to think in terms of literacy rather than reading as such - there s a whooooole lot which goes into literacy besides","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1598114311\">&quot;zachsmom31&quot; &lt;melgates@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I do recognize in me a desire to &quot;jump on&quot; this current interest/willingness...

Even without decoding print, your son is busy every day learning about print - he knows a lot already! I&#39;m willing to bet he holds books and magazines right way up and knows which is the front. He knows the difference between a fictional story and a news article and a set of directions. He probably knows what a plot is (even if he doesn&#39;t know the word, or uses &quot;story arc&quot; from having watched lots of movie extras) and a character. He knows about mood and tone and how those work differently in a fast-paced story versus a documentary. He is likely aware of similarities and differences in words - things like rhyme or alliteration or homophones, again even if he doesn&#39;t know those words. Chances are, he can recognize certain kinds of symbolism already. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a lot to know about literacy already! <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may also help you to notice things he does well Without the help of print. Kids who read later tend to develop better verbal memories, for instance - I mean they have an easier time remebering what they hear than us poor blighted souls who need to write everthing down (like me!). <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Reading ideas","postDate":"1318972864","msgId":47573,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo3a3FrMCsydHJyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBRzB1Vzg9R3NqblQ2MmQrQjhzcWhoRGFDOFVaTFVrQkVFcUphZm9jaUR0Y0FZZHEzUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":47561,"nextInTopic":47575,"prevInTime":47572,"nextInTime":47574,"topicId":47531,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************** Part of the confusion is that what kids learn to do in school isn t reading in the way adults read - it s not reading fluently with good","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1298105107\">Claire Darbaud &lt;cdarbaud@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; And yet most school children I have met learn to read between 3 à 7 or 8.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the confusion is that what kids learn to do in school isn&#39;t &quot;reading&quot; in the way adults read - it&#39;s not reading &quot;fluently&quot; with good comprehension, its going through the motions of reading.

At least here in the US<br/>\nkids are supposed to know a certain list of words and every year they add to that. <br/>\nIt is not reading. Reading is when you can read pretty much everything.<br/>\n The reading books are specially written for each grade so it only contains the  words the child <br/>\nis supposed to know. Even then many kids go to remedial classes or whatever they call in elementary.<br/>\nPlus kids are not required to read unassisted until they have completed 3rd grade,<br/>\nMy son wrote words at 3 and could read . I say he learned at 6 and half but if it was by school standard he was reading at 3.<br/>\nAt 6 and a half he could read anything. He was reading fluently. He could also understand what he was reading. <br/>\nMany kids read and have no comprehension of what they are reading. Do you ask yourself why?<br/>\nWhy do schools work on reading    and comprehension ? Because kids can read some words but they do not really understand what they are reading in a sentence. MY son can. At nine he can read and write stories. Sure they are not perfect but compared to what I have<br/>\nseen from kids they same age they are pretty good.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother did not learn to read in school until he was 11. I learned at 4. Same class , same teachers. WHo do you think was smarter and <br/>\ngrew up to become a song writer? Yep, my brother. I suck at words but he had a way with it.<br/>\nMany kids in school manage to even graduate without learning to read or they read when they are older like my brother and the thing they have in common is that they feel they are less then.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son and the neighbor kid ( they are best friends) are supposed to be in the same grade. While my son was reading fluently and loving it the neighbor kid did say he liked reading but that it was really really hard work.

You can make this a little trickier by saying you have to use them in the order they appear, or easier in just any order. <br/>\n<br/>\nA game we call First One To See: choose a roadsign/popular branding/familiar roadside word and the first one to see it picks the next word. (sometimes more fun if you run a few words at the same time)<br/>\n<br/>\nReading the map? Road signs, place of interest signs, snack names etc when you stop for breaks? Not really a game butt hey are opportunities to read. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s ok looking down a little while you&#39;re driving (ie. not car sick) you could spot words then he could try to put them together in a homemade crossword. If he isn&#39;t into writing, you could get a magnetic scrabble set and he could use that.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could play your spot the alphabet game but with whole words beginning with a, then b etc. And try to read the word as you spot it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I think of more I&#39;ll post. <br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards and enjoy your trip,<br/>\nJo <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 16 Oct 2011, at 05:36, &quot;zachsmom31&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:melgates@...\">melgates@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi.
