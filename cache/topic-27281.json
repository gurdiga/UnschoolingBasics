Hitting or anger is an expression of something.  <br/>\nAnd for you to acknowledge how frustrated your daughter is in the <br/>\nmoment and approach her with compassion for her frustration instead <br/>\nof judgment of her behaviour may make all the difference in your <br/>\nacceptance of her and your ability to help navigate the moment <br/>\nwithout attempting to control with threats, coercive abitrary <br/>\nboundaries, or punitive measures - as we are so conditioned to <br/>\nbelieve that that is the way to control another person smaller than <br/>\noneself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth is as soon as you let go of the idea that you can control <br/>\nanother person you can approach the situation in a whole other way.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing wrong with simply saying to someone (anyone) i don&#39;t <br/>\nlike to be hit or please don&#39;t yell at me.  And in some instances <br/>\nwith some kids that is enough information for them to alter their <br/>\nform of communication or behavior in the moment.  But maybe not for <br/>\nyour 5 year old who is very much in her moment of frustration or <br/>\nanger or whatever pain she is feeling that perciptitates behaviour <br/>\nthat is making *you* uncomfortable.  Which brings me to another point <br/>\nto look at - your comfort level with your daughters expression of her <br/>\nwill.  I know Leia and her will is beautiful to behold.  Can you <br/>\nshift your internal response from one of discomfort to one of <br/>\nadmiration that she is one who can clearly express herself with <br/>\ndirectness and strength?***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what we grew up with (punitive and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; threats) and it feels wrong, but unsure of what to replace it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>with.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My daughter is 5 and very much her own person and strong willed. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; kind of muddling through figuring out how to approach <br/>\n&gt; her &quot;differently&quot; - is there a general gentle approach?  What does <br/>\n&gt; it look like?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***Yes there is a different way - it looks like extreme patience.  <br/>\nYes there is a different way and it looks like extreme expression of <br/>\nlove and acceptance.  And to an outsider it won&#39;t look like you are <br/>\nattempting to control your daughter - because you are not attempting <br/>\nto control your daughter.  You will be responding to her with <br/>\ncompassion and perhaps shifting the enviroment or protecting her from <br/>\nexternal judgements.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt will look like you don&#39;t care what other people around you think <br/>\nbecause you are not concerned with being &quot;gentle&quot; per se but rather <br/>\nit will look like you are secure in your response to your daughter.  <br/>\nIt will look like you know what you are doing and *your* behavior <br/>\nwill not be punishing, complaining, blaming, threatening, nagging, <br/>\ncriticizing, and bribing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour behavior will be between you and your daughter - an expression <br/>\nof trust, of your respecting her expression of her moment.  In that <br/>\nmoment that your daughter is expressing her strong will in a way that <br/>\n*you* may think is not OK, is for her a very real, very ok, very <br/>\nappropriate expression of her experience of that very moment.  A 5 <br/>\nyear old lives in the moment - our unschooled kids are allowed to be <br/>\nin the moment. And we can not be afriad of their moments or <br/>\njudgemental of their expressions of their moments.<br/>\n<br/>\nGosh - i feel like i must sound so very didactic.   But i know your <br/>\ndaughter Leia and i&#39;ve never witnessed her doing anything that is not <br/>\n*OK* or appropriate to her experience.  I *have* witnessed *your* <br/>\ndiscomfort with her full expression of her moment.  Oh - dear Janna - <br/>\nnow i hope that i am not coming across to critical of you - but that <br/>\nyou can hear what i am saying.  I hope that i know you well enough <br/>\nthat i trust you have the ability to look at yourself in this <br/>\nsituation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen i am uncomfortable with anything either of my daughters do, it <br/>\nis time to look at myself.  Because the issue always seems to lie <br/>\nwithin myself and where i am needing to stretch myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe cannot control another person - but we can choose to change our <br/>\nresponse to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWishing you well - always.<br/>\nLisa Heyman</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Intro and boundaries w/Children","postDate":"1193243706","msgId":27294,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg4NDEyOC41MDI0MS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGZmbjlhdithN2I2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27290,"nextInTopic":27320,"prevInTime":27293,"nextInTime":27295,"topicId":27281,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Janna!

I&#39;m on so many <br/>\nlists now. I can&#39;t keep up! We moved to Coastal NC a year ago (from <br/>\nNew York) and we are still trying to find kindred spirits out here. <br/>\nI haven&#39;t met 1 unschooler in this area so it was refreshing to be <br/>\nat the Live & Learn this year. We found out about this list from <br/>\nGail when we were at the Live and Learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do unschoolers set boundaries or limits without using threats <br/>\n(&quot;take this away or that away...if you don&#39;t&quot;)? When the child is <br/>\ndoing something that is not okay (like, when she gets angry she will <br/>\ntry to hit me sometimes). This is what we grew up with (punitive and <br/>\nthreats) and it feels wrong, but unsure of what to replace it with.  <br/>\nMy daughter is 5 and very much her own person and strong willed. I&#39;m <br/>\nkind of muddling through figuring out how to approach <br/>\nher &quot;differently&quot; - is there a general gentle approach?
