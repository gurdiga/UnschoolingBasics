I tell him that being scared shouldn&#39;t stop someone from doing something, but rather to help us look at whatever we&#39;re afraid of in a different way, take baby steps, try something different, see something differently, try later etc.  Then I have stepped out of the way.  This has been HUGE for him!  He used to be told-don&#39;t be scared, you can do it!  He now knows that he CAN do anything (even when he is afraid), but it just might take some time to figure it out.  He is 5, and since I have told him this he has been on his first rollercoaster ride, started to swim underwater, started jumping into the pool, tries to catch a football (he was so scared of balls), started hanging from monkey bars, and talking to new people.  This has all happened in the past month!  His confidence is now on a major high!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest son is not reluctant at all.  I feel that some of it is in his personality, but the rest of his confidence has more to do with the different ways that I raised them in the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeanette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and <br/>\nknow-it-all with Yahoo!

Sometimes they push themselves further. Sometimes <br/>\nthey don&#39;t. The deal is: *I* have to be OK with their decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not naturally a risk-taker.  I recognize that<br/>\ncomes a lot in part from the way I was raised.  My parents were<br/>\nsupercautious and often told us that things were dangerous or that <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t<br/>\ndo things.  I have fought against that tendency in myself and forced <br/>\nmyself<br/>\nto take risks.  This ranges from riding rollercoasters to quitting a <br/>\njob I<br/>\nhated, to going back to school to train for a second career, to<br/>\nhomeschooling my children, and lots of smaller tasks.  Almost without <br/>\nfail,<br/>\nI have been delighted with the outcome of these &quot;risky&quot; behaviors.  But <br/>\nI<br/>\nstill have to convince myself that I can do them.  It really helps me <br/>\nwhen<br/>\nothers express confidence in me and encourage me to do these things.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a HUGE risk-taker---not necessarily with physical harm (although <br/>\nriding racehorses and hunter/jumpers IS fairly physically risky! &lt;G&gt;) <br/>\nor illegal stuff---more with &quot;what if&quot;---like new businesses and <br/>\nconferences and keeping bees and planting a flower *there* and <br/>\ntraveling a LOT---stuff that won&#39;t get me hurt or imprisoned or cause <br/>\nme too much physical pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my father *always* told me that I could do anything. Be anything. <br/>\nAnd I believed him. I still do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my boys see me model it. Taking risks is not without failures <br/>\nthough---and I have no problem owning up to my learning-takes. I&#39;ve <br/>\nlearned a lot from my failures---or maybe...&quot;unsuccesses&quot; is better. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about kids?  For instance, learning to drive.  When your child is <br/>\nold<br/>\nenough and you believe that he/she is capable, but the child is <br/>\nreluctant,<br/>\ndo you encourage the child to try?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d encourage. But I&#39;d hold no expectations that they should reach for. <br/>\nThey need to have their own expectations---not mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they are supported---wholly and unconditionally, they *will* take <br/>\nrisks---risks that *they* are comfortable with.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI would tend to do that because I know<br/>\nthat in my own experience, it feels so good to accomplish something <br/>\nthat I<br/>\nwas reluctant to start.  It could be other things, like jumping off the <br/>\nhigh<br/>\ndive, riding a rollercoaster.  Yesterday, we were at Six Flags and it<br/>\nreminded me of just a couple of years ago when I encouraged my son to <br/>\ntry a<br/>\nrollercoaster that he indicated he wanted to try but was scared of.  I <br/>\ngave<br/>\nhim the facts about rollercoasters, that the chances of something <br/>\nhappening<br/>\nto him were practically nil, that he would get an incredible adrenaline<br/>\nrush, that he might decide he hates it, but he might decide he loves it,<br/>\nthat he had very little to lose and might learn something about himself <br/>\nin<br/>\nthe process.  He tried it and came off flush with excitement.  &quot;Thanks <br/>\nso<br/>\nmuch, Mom, for encouraging me to try.  I LOVED it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you earned was his trust. He trusted you a little already---enough <br/>\nto try it. Then his trust in you doubled because he found that you were <br/>\nRIGHT!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s when our &quot;try-it-you&#39;ll-have-fun-I-promise&quot; encouragements have <br/>\n*negative* outcomes.
