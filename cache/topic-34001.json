The son&#39;s plans when he became a man were to smoke, drink, and eat meat. He saw those things as the choices one makes with freedom. I have a daughter who is a vegetarian. I&#39;m not a vegetarian, but I have never forced her or tricked her or limited her so that she would have the same moral belief as I do. Simon, my son, was a vegetarian when he was much younger, again, his choice and I was happy to support him. When he decided to eat meat I never lectured him about how he was letting go of his moral compass to satisfy his carnal nature &lt;BWG&gt;. I just bought meat for him. Linnaea and I have had a lot of conversations about why I eat meat and the meat I choose to buy and eat. Because of her ethical vegetarianism it is important to her that the meat David and I eat come from animals who were reared well. Fortunately meat is a luxury item that we afford when we can and in a form that I<br/>\n feel good about. <br/>\n<br/>\nI picked Simon up from sleepover party once that was being held at a vegetarian household, bar one. Because of the one, the dad had lots of bacon around and was fixing bacon sandwiches for breakfast. One girl, who lives in a family that has enforced vegetarianism, said, &quot;Piglets are killed when they are 22 weeks old to make bacon.&quot; She then took a sandwich (there were plenty of vegetarian options available).  I figured her sandwich must taste of guilt and rebellion as well as a 22 week old piglet. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with making your vegetarianism his is that he doesn&#39;t get the chance to choose to eat as a vegetarian or as an omnivore without having the underlying guilt and pressure that you&#39;ve created in your desire to form his beliefs in the image of your own. Eating, for him, may always have emotional and moral overtones that it doesn&#39;t need to have. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a child is often about embracing change; learning to go with another person&#39;s flow; napping when they nap and waking when they wake. It&#39;s a wonderful thing when you have the luxury to wrap your life around the rhythm of your child&#39;s life. Holding on to rules that you made before you had a child is putting a barrier between you and your son. It becomes a point of contention, whether or not it is a spoken point. There are wonderful discussions about rules versus principles(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/rules)\">http://sandradodd.com/rules)</a>, but I&#39;m not sure what principle not having meat in your house could possibly be supporting. It is about you being a vegetarian. From what you have written it isn&#39;t about anyone else in your household being a vegetarian. It seems very exclusionary. <br/>\n<br/>\nLinnaea and I were upstairs this morning talking about this e-mail and I was talking about her dad and how he was a vegetarian for a long time. But that didn&#39;t preclude from having meat on occassion. When he was travelling in rural Belize he ate deer and fish, when he lived in the more inaccessible islands in the Phillipines he ate meat and when he would come with me to visit my grandparents he ate meat. For all of them, at least part of it was because his desire to be a vegetarian was less important than honoring his hosts. In the Phillipines I don&#39;t know that he could have sustained himself easily without meat, at my grandparents in Wichita, Kansas it would have been easy. But it made my grandparents happy to feed him, and he wanted to help them to be happy. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am now going to step into the veg thing below.  I have been a vegetarian since 1993.  I am modeling the vegetarian life and choices for my son.  I do not and will not cook meat in my house, it is against  my principles; my son and DH sometimes choose to eat meat when we are elsewhere.  Why shouldn&#39;t I model my personal beliefs to my son?  Why shouldn&#39;t I help him make the decision himself by explaining why I do not eat meat and do not have it in the house (and at 4.5 he can explain where meat comes from, so he has the connection between real live animal and meat on the plate) but that he is quite free to eat it elsewhere?  The no meat in the house was something my husband and I decided in early 1994.<br/>\n<br/>\nWere it a religious reason for abstaining from meat, would the situation be different?  The children you mention do eat meat, just not from mom. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo be a true unschooler, does one have to do things that are against one&#39;s principles or religious beliefs if the child requests it?<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin<br/>\n<br/>\n-- &quot;swissarmy_wife&quot; &lt;heatherbean@ gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also bothers me that you have children who clearly like meat, but<br/>\nyou will not make it for them.

I feed my 2 carnivorous dogs raw meat even<br/>\nthough I have been a vegetarian for 7 years.  The health of rawfed<br/>\ndogs is wondrous to behold, but I always made the analogy that I do<br/>\nthe same for my son (age 3) in that I put an emphasis on fresh, not<br/>\nprocessed, food for him believing that because his diet has been<br/>\ncompletely vegetarian I was doing him a favor and getting him off to a<br/>\ngood start.  I never saw it as limiting his choices or experience (or<br/>\ntreating my dogs better then I treat my son).<br/>\n<br/>\nI see the point that everyone has made about giving children a &#39;true&#39;<br/>\nchoice.  My husband is an omnivore and my son has eaten sausage and<br/>\nother items from his plate when we were out to dinner and that was<br/>\nfine. I did my best to be accepting, not sure if I pulled it off, but<br/>\nI tried not to make a big deal out of it. I always knew that once my<br/>\nson figured out his father was not a vegetarian that I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nable to keep his diet veg, but the reality that this time has come at<br/>\nage 3 is unsettling.  I have had very little trouble feeding my dogs<br/>\nraw meat because I don&#39;t have to cook it and there is very little<br/>\nhandling involved. I also am fortunate to get the leftovers from local<br/>\nproducers who treat their animals as humanely and ethically as<br/>\npossible. The thought of cooking animal products again is more then<br/>\ndaunting.  Well, we&#39;ll see how it goes and hopefully I will have<br/>\nenough experience meeting his other needs in a respectful, joyful way<br/>\nthat if the requests for home cooked animal products ever does get<br/>\nraised I will be able to support my DS in his choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew this unschooling thing was too good to be true! <br/>\n<br/>\n(Ummm...just to be clear, that last line was a joke.

She is free to go to Wal-Mart, if she chooses. She chooses not. We have been in Wal-Mart (I was told they were selling one of my designs), we noticed that Prilosec was over $3.00 more than I pay at CVS, I was on a Cheese-Nips binge and saw that the Cheese-Nips were more than 80 cents more than at Shaws.<br/>\nWe also have friends on various reservations. The Wal-Mart up near the Mandan-Hidatsu rez in North Dakota put all the smaller stores out of business then raised their prices.<br/>\nBrianna knows this. These are her friends too.

They were not unschooled (I do have a 4 and 2 year old <br/>\nthat I am unschooling) but they knew that I would respect thier <br/>\nchoice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo one told them to become vegatarians, or encouraged them.  They <br/>\ncame to that conclusion after reading about slaughter houses, and the <br/>\nPETA website.  They informed themselves with everything they needed <br/>\nto make what I consider a thought-filled descision.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was not, and still is not easy!!!  My husband won&#39;t touch a <br/>\nvegtable.  So I had to make 2 dinners a night, one for them, one for <br/>\nus.  <br/>\nAlways had to make sure to have bocca burgers, and morning star food <br/>\navailable for them.  Made sure that thier stuffing was made with <br/>\nvegtable stock, not chicken stock....I had to learn more than I ever <br/>\nwanted to about the vegatarian lifestyle.  (well they taught me most <br/>\nof it)..and I kept hoping, or thinking it was a fad or a phase that <br/>\nwould pass.  Well, it hasn&#39;t, and even though they crave a good pork <br/>\nchop or steak every now and again, I don&#39;t think they would ever go <br/>\nback.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never serve them meat and expect them to eat it because it is <br/>\nmy house, or because I think that they should eat it.  I think that <br/>\nthey respect me more because I allowed them this choice, AND <br/>\nsupported it.  I also think it is great for my little ones, one of <br/>\nwhich doesn&#39;t prefer meat, and one that does.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe looking at things from that point of view will help you <br/>\nunderstand.  If you were made to eat meat in someone else&#39;s house, if <br/>\nsomeone else did not agree with you, or would not prepare something <br/>\ndifferent for you...it might make you question thier respect for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":49412617,"authorName":"Coyote","from":"&quot;Coyote&quot; &lt;janis@...&gt;","profile":"janacoyote","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Not eating meat WAS: TV Help me understand","postDate":"1214349565","msgId":34027,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc5OTMwMWM4ZDY1MCRiZTI4Mjk5MCRjYTAxYThjMEBDb3lvdGU+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDgwNjI0LjA5NDIzMC4xNjUxMi4wQHdlYm1haWwxNy5kY2EudW50ZC5jb20+IDxjYzYxMjBhMTA4MDYyNDE1NTNrMmFkM2JmZDB0YmQwMzg5NGFlYTMwMjRiMkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":34025,"nextInTopic":34028,"prevInTime":34026,"nextInTime":34028,"topicId":34001,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I cannot imagine doing this.

I basically lived that same way<br/>\nwith my oldest son - he could eat meat while out with his Dad or over<br/>\nat a friend&#39;s, but I didn&#39;t want it in the house. It grossed me out!<br/>\nHe *never* asked for meat, it just wasn&#39;t a part of his life. Until...<br/>\nMcDonalds! And chicken nuggets! He LOVED them. How could I keep him<br/>\nfrom something he loved? It seemed silly to me, to place these<br/>\nprinciples before my own son.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen... along came youngest son. I still didn&#39;t cook meat in the<br/>\nhouse, and no one asked for it - until Mother&#39;s Day when he was 3. We<br/>\nmet at my mom&#39;s; my then-husband took Evan and Seth to her house while<br/>\nI ran to the grocery store. I bought a rotisserie chicken, and when<br/>\nSeth ran out to greet me, he came running toward me, his arms open for<br/>\na big hug. When he got close, he stopped, sniffed loudly, looked in<br/>\nthe bag and said with a big grin: &quot;Mama! Kicken! Tank you!!&quot;  I<br/>\nrealized... this child *needs* meat. So, 6 and a half years later,<br/>\nmeat&#39;s a part of my repertoire in the kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not up to me to determine my children&#39;s values for them. I share<br/>\ninformation I have - and they make their choices. I support their choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust last week, I cooked a *steak* for Seth, because he asked for one.<br/>\newww. Evan was grossed out by it, even though he&#39;ll eat burgers.

How well can he cook fried chicken if that&#39;s what he <br/>\nwants? It&#39;s up to *you*, his mom, to provide that *for* him, if that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat he wants and needs, even if it&#39;s not for *you*.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if your mother had forced you to eat meat---or worse---*tricked* <br/>\nyou into eating it---because she believed that eating meat was <br/>\nimportant in your diet. How would that have made you feel?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older son is frequently a vegetarian (he&#39;s probably eating meat <br/>\nright now because he&#39;s in the wilds of the Yukon, and it&#39;s a <br/>\nsurvivalist&#39;s program: out in the wild, you eat what you can get!). I <br/>\nmake every effort to keep his meals vegie. What if I said, &quot;You can eat <br/>\nvegetarian when you&#39;re out elsewhere, but *here* we eat meat!&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s not you. Treat him as he would like to be treated.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy shouldn&#39;t I help him make the decision himself<br/>\nby explaining why I do not eat meat and do not have it in the house <br/>\n(and at 4.5<br/>\nhe can explain where meat comes from, so he has the connection between <br/>\nreal live<br/>\nanimal and meat on the plate) but that he is quite free to eat it <br/>\nelsewhere?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s not getting to make *any* decision. You&#39;re making it *for* him! By <br/>\nnot fixing it---or at least having it available, like the rotisserie <br/>\nchicken, or sliced meats or whatever. He gets NO say in this process.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe no meat in the house was something my husband and I decided in <br/>\nearly 1994.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFine, but now you have a child who wants meat. So maybe there needs to <br/>\nbe a &quot;new&quot; decision for 2008.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWere it a religious reason for abstaining from meat, would the <br/>\nsituation be<br/>\ndifferent?<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-==-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think so, but I&#39;m not religious. I have plenty of Jewish friends who <br/>\nlove a good pork chop.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe children you mention do eat meat, just not from mom.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWho?

They aren&#39;t the child&#39;s principles or beliefs, are they? <br/>\nWhy can&#39;t the child choose? Why are his beliefs and principles less <br/>\nvalid or important?
