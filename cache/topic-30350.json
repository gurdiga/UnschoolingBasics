Is that the only way they enforce the law to follow the <br/>\nnational curriculum?  Have you talked to your kids about it?  Not to <br/>\nscare them or anything, but to let them know what the consequences <br/>\nare.  Perhaps there are ways to gain the skills to pass the test that <br/>\nwould be more a natural part of life than sitting at the kitchen <br/>\ntable doing lessons.  Reading books on things they like, looking up <br/>\nthings on the internet...  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is some chatter here in Virginia because next to us in <br/>\nWashington DC there is legislation that would tighten up <br/>\nhomeschooling in a similar way.  Requiring following their curriculum <br/>\n(if you&#39;ve ever heard how bad DC schools are, you should be laughing <br/>\nhysterically now).  I&#39;ve wondered what I would do.  To me unschooling <br/>\nis about getting the most joy out of life.  I think I would be more <br/>\njoyful doing a little curriculum than fending off the authorities.  <br/>\nAnd then working within the system to help bring about change.  We&#39;re <br/>\nso lucky in our state to have a state homeschool organization which <br/>\nis organized and well run (mostly by unschoolers) that keeps on top <br/>\nof legislation as it arises and helps to educate our lawmakers about <br/>\nhomeschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to hear more about the law and organizations like that in <br/>\nSwitzerland. <br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;seccotine_ch&quot; <br/>\n&lt;seccotine@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ***** <br/>\n&gt; Joyce Fetteroll wrote :<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Again why is more important than what.

EITHER you understand that children are <br/>\nhard-wired to learn, OR you don&#39;t. That part&#39;s not difficult to <br/>\nunderstand. That is very black & white.<br/>\n<br/>\nDO you believe that your children will learn EVERYTHING they will need <br/>\nto know? NOT *before* they need to know it, but that they will learn it <br/>\nWHEN they need to know it?<br/>\n<br/>\n*HOW* they learn it will be different for each and every person. So <br/>\nwill *WHEN*. And *WHERE*. *WHY* may also be different, but it should be <br/>\nrelated to the *learner&#39;s* desire to learn that thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could someone unschool part time? What would that look like? <br/>\nSeriously---can anyone here describe that to me? I trust you to learn <br/>\n*this*, but not *that*?? What kind of trust is that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you trust me to learn---if you trust that I am *capable* of learning <br/>\neverything I need to know, why would you feel the need to *make* me <br/>\nlearn anything?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could *help* me, if I have the desire, but you can&#39;t *force* me to! <br/>\nAnd by forcing, you demonstrate that you don&#39;t NOT, in fact, *trust* me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if the kids choose the class or want the curriculum?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* do that sometimes. Both of my boys have done it. Ben (my husband) <br/>\nis doing that right this minute: he&#39;s studying for War <br/>\nCollege----because he *wants* to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe philosophical problem comes from the societal view that classes and <br/>\ncurriculum and teachers are considered THE ways to learn. Any other <br/>\nlearning isn&#39;t really valued. If that&#39;s the way you or your children <br/>\nare seeing their classes and curricula, then it shows a lack of *trust* <br/>\nin the learning process.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, on the other hand, you see classes and curricula as a different way <br/>\nto access the information or a fun way to learn, then it&#39;s just that: a <br/>\ndifferent way to access the information and a fun way to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nSEEing that difference will enable you to trust that we *are* natural <br/>\nlearners. Classes and curricula can be fine ways to learn---if that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat makes the learner happy.

They also like taking classes at the Mystic Seaport Museum (the science related ones) and sometimes at the local nature center. <br/>\n   I never considered us to be true unschoolers, but ecclectic.  Although I would like to work on more unschooling. Is this also part time unschooling? What if the kids choose the class or want the curriculum? <br/>\n     -Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNever miss a thing.

Well, there&#39;s no UNIVERSAL definition. *I* have <br/>\none. I really GOOD one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically *anything* is unschooling to many people who simply aren&#39;t <br/>\nsending their kids to school. *I* feel they haven&#39;t bothered to read <br/>\nJohn Holt, if that&#39;s what they think it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* think Holt was VERY specific in his description/definition. He was <br/>\nwholly behind the idea that children are NATURAL learning machines and <br/>\nthat we don&#39;t need to coerce anything. That children *want* to learn <br/>\nand *want* to be as adult-like as possible. That we just need to be <br/>\npatient---and trusting and respectful and generous and curious and <br/>\nMODEL all that for them.
