She can be very angry and sad at times and especially angry at me <br/>\nand I find that very difficult. She says things to me and I feel so sad <br/>\nand hurt afterwards. it is taking a huge amount of energy to continue to <br/>\njust be there for her- to care for myself in ways that allow those hurt <br/>\nfeelings to pass so I can move on with her. She is very envious of her <br/>\nbrother who is 14 and has many passions and friends. She wants friends <br/>\nbut is having difficulty connecting in the situations we are in and has <br/>\nhad difficult times with a couple friends lately. She is just going <br/>\nthrough a large change, overall. She is beginning to find new interests- <br/>\nwhich is really exciting, but the friends part isn&#39;t falling into place <br/>\nand I feel like I really am not able to help her with this(though I will <br/>\nkeep trying) - she just isn&#39;t willing as much anymore to do things she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t prefer in order to be part of a group or be with another person <br/>\nand her interests are getting really specific. This is okay except she <br/>\nfeels sad and lonely. I am her main connection. It will take time and <br/>\njust being with all the emotions for her and for myself is important <br/>\nright now. I am needing to drop some other things to give her more time. <br/>\nThe idea that kids just gradually need less attention as they grow is a <br/>\nfalse one as they at times need so much going through transitions such <br/>\nas entering the teen years. This has been a challenge for me to accept.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter needs sleep next to me sometimes, needs to be taken lots of <br/>\nplaces, needs lots of treats and new things and supplies for projects, <br/>\nneeds especially to be reassured constantly in many ways that she is <br/>\nimportant and worth my time and resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son went through this at one point- growing away from friends in the <br/>\nmidst of finding new interests, but he has found a couple of things he <br/>\nloves to do with friends and in general is a more accommodating person- <br/>\nor is with friend that he likes, anyway. He is willing to work at <br/>\nfinding things to enjoy together. He very seemed discontent for a while <br/>\nalso.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMeredith wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; &lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Faith Void&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t understand this new era of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; development<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It sounds as though she&#39;s starting to go through some dramatic<br/>\n&gt; internal changes - the way she thinks and sees the world is starting<br/>\n&gt; to shift away from more concrete to more abstract patterns of<br/>\n&gt; thinking and perception.

That&#39;s a pretty unsettling experience, and <br/>\nmay account for a lot of her overall disatisfaction. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to what you can *do* about that? Mostly just be aware that she&#39;s <br/>\ngoing through a transitional time and transitions are never easy. <br/>\nBeyond that, take your cues from her - even though they will <br/>\nundoubtably be very very mixed. She may be wanting to be alone more, <br/>\nfor example, to process some of these big new ideas, and <br/>\nsimultaneously want to stay as distracted as possible so that she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t *have* to think. Do you see how those conflicting urges <br/>\nmight lead to her being hard to get along with? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She seems (by her words and actions) to<br/>\n&gt; be dissatisfied with everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does she seem to be looking for new directions to go in overall? She <br/>\nmay *be* dissatisfied in a sort of general sense. Nothing feels like <br/>\nit &quot;fits&quot; anymore, on a conceptual level. Maybe she needs to find a <br/>\nnew interest that she can grow into (although I&#39;d be willing to bet <br/>\nshe&#39;d be at least as intimidated as excited by the idea). Depending <br/>\non how she is overall, she may be looking for totally new things to <br/>\nread or watch or do, totally new people to hang out with. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (also we just had a baby a week ago and<br/>\n&gt; I am very short on energy) <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s an added challenge, for sure. She may even feel torn <br/>\nbetween playing caretaker and getting as far away from the baby as <br/>\npossible *and* wanting her mommy back (and wanting mommy to leave <br/>\nher alone and let her figure out what she wants dangit). Aaaaaaack! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, try to keep in mind that her *needs* are changing. They&#39;re <br/>\nstill the same concrete human needs of food and rest and comfort and <br/>\nall that, but she is starting to have more conceptual needs, too, <br/>\nthat she&#39;s having trouble identifying and expressing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry not to be more helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 14)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":259654066,"authorName":"greenqueen72","from":"&quot;greenqueen72&quot; &lt;boulier72@...&gt;","profile":"greenqueen72","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: need perspective change","postDate":"1191788940","msgId":26871,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZlYmZpYyt1ODhhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDcxMDA3MTAwM2g0YjEwODVkN281ZjQ3NmRjNjcyZjhhM0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26848,"nextInTopic":26897,"prevInTime":26870,"nextInTime":26872,"topicId":26848,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Faith~ I understand how you feel.

I too have dd&#39;s- well- 3 of them. 12, 9.5,  &<br/>\n7 and I hear your sadness and frustration. I try to remember how I felt<br/>\nat their ages and purpose not to take too much too personally. My 2<br/>\noldest can behave very erratically at times & then at others can be very<br/>\nkind, giving and sweet. It is hard to always know how to respond or<br/>\nreact, but I can suggest you step back when she is like that and just<br/>\nsee her through it- it will pass. What I think they need most is our<br/>\nstability and unconditional presence. What they are going through at<br/>\nthis age is new and maybe even a bit scary so our consistent patience<br/>\n(and I understand you are tired) will help them feel safe. I thought<br/>\nhome schooling would cause an almost complete escape from many of the<br/>\nissues I was warned about (ughhh- insensitive people!) -it has made it<br/>\nmore tolerable and we have plenty of time to talk through things- but<br/>\ndevelopmental stuff happens. As Moms, I think we take soooo much to<br/>\nheart and just want to please and shelter our kids from any pain, but as<br/>\nwe all know the hard times are what propels us toward growth and<br/>\nmaturity- IMO- of course. We can&#39;t change everything but we can help by<br/>\nbeing present, offering lots of hugs and an always open ear,  providing<br/>\nas healthy of an environment as possible, and empowering them by<br/>\ntrusting that they will succeed and overcome whatever comes their way. I<br/>\nhope that encourages you. Remember too that you are at a new time also<br/>\nand allow your dd to see you  learning to adjust to change (with your<br/>\nnew baby- congratulations!) That in itself is life altering and<br/>\nintimidating in some ways- perhaps to her as well as you. I remember<br/>\nwhen each of my babies were born and it is as much of a challenge for<br/>\nthe other people in the family as it is for us.<br/>\n((hugs 2 u))<br/>\nRachel<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Faith Void&quot;<br/>\n&lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am having an issue involving my 10.5 y/o dd.
