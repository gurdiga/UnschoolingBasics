If it doesn&#39;t fit, you <br/>\nmust quit?<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, in some sort crazed moment, I talked to the Boys & Girls Club near me <br/>\nabout volunteering as a reading tutor. There is no way I will have time to <br/>\nactually do this -- I got home with the form to fill out and haven&#39;t even had time <br/>\nto do that much. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, aside from my temporary insanity, I did one thing right I think. I <br/>\nmentioned right away that we are hsers. That my hours are flexible. (This was <br/>\nbefore I realized that they may be flexible but I don&#39;t have enough of them.) The <br/>\nG&B lady was very nice but said these are kids who are in ps so they need vols <br/>\nduring the after school hours. 3:00 and on. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy job is not to change them or their schedule but to fit myself into their <br/>\nworld -- imo -- if I ever (when the kids are older?) am able to vol there. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I won&#39;t expect to have conversations about learning and hsing and <br/>\nunschooling -- or to make friends with the Moms or B&G staff. If it happens, it <br/>\nhappens. But I would go into it knowing that there is a huge difference between our <br/>\nchosen lifestyles.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, imo, don&#39;t let the pushy playground lady upset you -- tell her off and <br/>\nget back to having fun. Take her aside if you need to. But don&#39;t let her get <br/>\nyou down. Don&#39;t expect to change her either. Her unhappiness is not your problem <br/>\nthough. When we have met people like this, my kids and I have had nice <br/>\nconversations on the way home about how certain people need to have sticks removed <br/>\nfrom . . . well, you get the idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, I don&#39;t like rudeness and when someone else&#39;s kid is disturbing us, I <br/>\nlet the kid know. (No, I don&#39;t think your son was rude -- just not aware of the <br/>\netiquette perhaps and excited.) And if the parent is sitting right there -- <br/>\nwell, they get to see me explain to their child how running and yelling in the <br/>\nmiddle of someone else&#39;s time to be heard or have quiet is not acceptable <br/>\n(This usually starts out with me saying: &quot;I&#39;m not shushing you just to be mean. <br/>\nThere is a reason. And the reason is . . .&quot; ). So then I am the mean Mom and the <br/>\nother parent can go home all upset with me. Sigh. . .<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1400,"nextTopicId":1403}}
