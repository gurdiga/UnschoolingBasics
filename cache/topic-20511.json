I actually lurked and read *every* post (with a huge<br/>\nhead nod several times, sitting on my hands to avoid posting a silly &quot;I<br/>\nagree!&quot; to a post months old haha), even dug back into the archives, for<br/>\nweeks and weeks, and then made an introduction.  Many of the posts<br/>\nresonated with me like being reunited with parts of my own mindset again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live our lifestyle with joy and positivity and grace and beauty, and<br/>\nfear just doesn&#39;t enter into the picture.  So in any lifestyle, be it<br/>\nsugar-free, meat-free, scent-free, environmentally conscious or<br/>\nless-wasteful or consumeristic, or whatever...  for US, the clear<br/>\ndefinition is in how we *live*, does it give us joy?  Or do *we* feel<br/>\ndeprived and like we&#39;re missing out?  And do we *behave* like *we* are<br/>\nclearly deprived and are trying really hard to restrict?  Abundance is a<br/>\nmindset we&#39;ve adopted, and we live a life of joy, gratitude and<br/>\nfriendship to others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know people who are older and bitter about not having this or that or<br/>\nthe other thing, so I have sometimes either taken money and bought<br/>\npeople something they were hankering for or found a good deal on it, and<br/>\nbeen able to give it to them anonymously (if I could, as that is my<br/>\nbelief in giving, that it not be about *me* but about the other person),<br/>\nand they don&#39;t have *joy*... they&#39;re not satisfied.  We choose to<br/>\ncelebrate the positive and the joy in life, and help other people (if we<br/>\ncan) who have plenty of reason to feel hurt and sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur kids still do get sugar, but they get very little of it from our<br/>\nhouse simply because we live in a neighbourhood where their friends<br/>\nconsume a very high amount of sugar.  I buy a 1kg (2kg?) bag of white<br/>\nsugar and a 1kg bag of &quot;brown sugar&quot;, and our children are free to make<br/>\ncookies/cakes whenever they want, but they rarely feel like it.  We just<br/>\ndon&#39;t even think of anything we do as &quot;missing out&quot; or anything.  It&#39;s<br/>\njoyful and abundant :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd our children enjoy it, and that&#39;s what unschooling is all about,<br/>\nfrom the many posts I read here and in the shine with unschooling group,<br/>\nthe joy of celebrating children!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best to everyone, and I&#39;ll enjoy continuing to read, and post<br/>\nwhere I can join in the conversation :)<br/>\nThis group is very welcoming, and is a joy to participate in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriannah in Nova Scotia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":278107510,"authorName":"alisonslp","from":"&quot;alisonslp&quot; &lt;alisonslp@...&gt;","profile":"alisonslp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: newcomers posting","postDate":"1168319927","msgId":20528,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVudjhqbiszYzM0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwYWUwMWM3MzNhOCQzOTgwZTdhMCRmYzY4OTA0NUBkZWJvcmFoNzZhNzlodj4="},"prevInTopic":20511,"nextInTopic":20549,"prevInTime":20527,"nextInTime":20529,"topicId":20511,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Deb, Thanks for the expansion.

I asked newer members to <br/>\npost less and read more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome newer members have posted many times to the list and in not very clear <br/>\nor well thought out ways.   I&#39;m asking that they consider reading more and <br/>\nposting less.   It&#39;s a suggestion, made as kindly as possible, with the <br/>\nsmooth operation of the list in mind.

Many posts by new people cannot and have not been doing that. <br/>\nAdvice to be afraid of candy or chipmunks or whatever other personal boogie <br/>\nman an individual may have is not good unschooling advice.
