How DO you keep them from getting caught up in<br/>\nthis?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHell if I know! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI struggled with it so much! He&#39;d bought into it after so many years in <br/>\nschool---and a private prep school to boot!<br/>\n<br/>\nI sat next to him one night while he IMed one girl from school. She <br/>\nwent on and on about how he would never amount to anything without <br/>\nschool---how he&#39;s never learn algebra or history or phyisics or a <br/>\nforiegn language or....<br/>\n<br/>\nI helped him write back---asking her about certain things and <br/>\nreassuring him that he&#39;d be just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat helped the most was time. He left school at the end of sixth <br/>\ngrade. His friends were starting algebra and writing and reading TONS. <br/>\nHe did not much of anything: he was proving her point! Then he slowly <br/>\nclimbed out of that. If I had stopped nagging and whining at him a bit <br/>\nsooner, I feel *sure* he would have climbed out faster---My bad! He <br/>\nstarted slowly finding interests and getting out and doing. He was <br/>\nskateboarding and filming--he was finally active. He got his driver&#39;s <br/>\nlicense. I supported all of it---financially and emotionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took a while, but he watched as his friends, who were die-hard <br/>\nschool-is-mandatory-at-all-costs. He watched them become more and more <br/>\ndisillusioned with school. Four of his friends were asked to leave the <br/>\nprivate school because they would eventually bring the high school <br/>\nnumbers down---they weren&#39;t competeive enough. They all went to public <br/>\nschools and goofed off. They hated their schools, their teachers, their <br/>\nparents, their lives. Two of them were arrested. One&#39;s mom told him she <br/>\nnever wanted to see him again; he lives with his dad now. They&#39;re <br/>\nreally good, sweet kids who just rebelled at what they perceived as <br/>\ninjustices.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily (or not?), Cameron avoided all these horrible things that were <br/>\nhappening to his friends. He can look at it more objectively now. I <br/>\nthink that had he remained in school, it would have sucked the very <br/>\nlife out of him. He would have been a solid &quot;B&quot; student. He would have <br/>\nstruggled, but done OK, school-wise. But the rest of him would have <br/>\ndied. He knows this too. Now. Now he&#39;s as gung-ho as anyone could be <br/>\nabout unschooling. I think he knows it saved him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope others who pull their kids out don&#39;t get caught up in this. It&#39;s <br/>\njust so hard to get through. Meeting other really cool unschoolers <br/>\nhelped---helped him see they weren&#39;t as odd as some of the homeschooled <br/>\nteens he&#39;d met. Time helped the most---and distance from the schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\nOctober 6-9, 2005<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Teenagers","postDate":"1122479891","msgId":5866,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDNzYwREIxRkQwQTE2Qi1FMzAtM0I4Q0BNQkxLLU0zOC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRjOGE4NStpdjByQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5865,"nextInTopic":5876,"prevInTime":5865,"nextInTime":5867,"topicId":5750,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Open and eager! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy comment is about Gail&#39;s quote above.  I&#39;ve heard this again and<br/>\nagain, and what I find is that it&#39;s hard for me to translate my passions<br/>\ninto anything my kids would be interested in.  I&#39;m not crafty, artful or<br/>\nmusically inclined.  I don&#39;t necessarily like games.  I work out of my<br/>\nhome, and I&#39;m on the computer or on the phone when I work, if I&#39;m not<br/>\nout at meetings or speaking engagements.  I&#39;m a &#39;big idea&#39; person and a<br/>\nvisionary in the adult world, but not so good with the minutia or<br/>\ntranslating those big ideas to my children.  I loved school and have<br/>\nbeen a perpetual student all my life.   I love to read, read, read.  The<br/>\nonly things I know how to &#39;strew&#39; are books.  (This can only go so far<br/>\nwith two small energetic boys.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I love unschooling and believe in it wholeheartedly, my<br/>\nconfession is that sometimes I think I&#39;m not cut out to be an<br/>\nunschooling mom.  In my moments of frustration, I think unschooling only<br/>\nworks for crafty, energetic, creative, get on the ground, get messy<br/>\nkinds of moms.   Are there other moms like me who are successfully and<br/>\njoyful unschooling?  Since my boys are young I&#39;ve got some time to grow<br/>\ninto it all, just let me know there&#39;s hope!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOoooh---I&#39;m one of those &quot;crafty, energetic, creative, get on the <br/>\nground, get messy&quot; kind of moms! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it depends on what kind of kids you have too---or what you can <br/>\nthink of to help them get what they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenetically, your kids could be a lot like you: you might luck out <br/>\nthere! &lt;g&gt; If not, you might need to find them outlets that would spur <br/>\ntheir interests. Like a Lego team or robotics group or 4-H or <br/>\n---whatever their interests are. You may do more driving than some of <br/>\nus.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;big idea&quot; part of you could be involved in making things happen. <br/>\nLike a conference! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really important for them to see you passionate about things. If <br/>\nyou like reading and discussing philosophical points---let them see you <br/>\ndo that. Join Toastmasters. A debate team. Write your own book. Join a <br/>\npoetry club. Host a mystery dinner. Do what you love.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doens&#39;t matter that it&#39;s not something *they* would be interested <br/>\nin. They may or may not join you. But they *will* see that it&#39;s <br/>\nimportant to follow a dream or or pursue a passion.<br/>\n<br/>\nLET them see that.

Right now he&#39;s at Not Back to School Camp in West <br/>\nVirginia. I understand he&#39;s having a blast. I can&#39;t give you an example <br/>\nof a specific day, but I can give you an idea of some of the things he <br/>\ndoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last three weeks, he has been housesitting, so he hasn&#39;t even been <br/>\nat home except to visit. He started this business when a friend of ours <br/>\nneeded someone to look after her dogs one weekend. It&#39;s turned into an <br/>\nalmost full-time gig. He stays at the house---doesn&#39;t just feed the <br/>\ndogs, but cares for the house too. He walks the dogs, brushes them, <br/>\nmakes sure they get meds, waters plants, takes care of mail and papers, <br/>\nwaters lawns---whatever. He&#39;s in high demand!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe works for two caterers parttime---it&#39;s sporadic. Some weeks he works <br/>\n5-6 days per week. Others, he hardly works at all. He delivers a local <br/>\nnewspaper on Wednesdays. They&#39;ve told me he&#39;s their best employee.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s started a band---took it upon himself to search out members. He <br/>\nset up the practice schedule (Tuesday & Friday nights, sometimes on <br/>\nSundays). They meet in our garage. He contacted a guy a couple of weeks <br/>\nago to record them. That happened the night before he left for camp. He <br/>\nhas a CD! &lt;g&gt; They&#39;re writing their own music and are now looking to <br/>\nset up a playing gig in town. Cameron plays the drums. He&#39;s out in the <br/>\ngarage 2-4 hours per day---sometimes more. The house-sitting puts a <br/>\ndent in drumming some days! :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nHe volunteers one night a week (Mondays) at the local independent film <br/>\ntheatre. He gets to watch the week&#39;s movie for free and has met some <br/>\nreally neat people. He worked with a few of them on a movie short last <br/>\nfall as a camera operator.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe swore he&#39;s never read again after he left school, but he subcribes <br/>\nto two drumming magazines, Modern Drummer and Relix. Reads them cover <br/>\nto cover. He&#39;s also into Phish and The Grateful Dead and Jimi <br/>\nHendrix---reads all about them and the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s a hippie! &lt;g&gt; He shops at thrift stores and makes some of his own <br/>\nclothes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has a girlfriend (dating for over two years now). He spends time <br/>\nwith her almost every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe pays his own car insurance and gas and maintenance (the car was a <br/>\ngift from us).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe draws. Not as much as he used to, but he still dabbles. I bet that <br/>\nwill pick up after we finish the room above the garage. We&#39;re putting a <br/>\nbathroom and AC up there and dividing it into a music room for the band <br/>\nand an art studio.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe helps me out around the house. He has certain things he prefers to <br/>\ndo---like empty the dishwasher (and I HATE doing that!) and garbage <br/>\ncollection (my hippie insists that I don&#39;t recycle nearly enough, so he <br/>\ndoes it for me! &lt;g&gt;). He does some heavy lifting of things I&#39;m getting <br/>\ntoo old to do---especially garden work. He takes care of our two cats <br/>\nand the rabbit. I care for the dogs, the rats, and the bees.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t watch much tv. He records That 70&#39;s Show and the Cosby Show <br/>\non TiVo---that&#39;s pretty much all he watches regularly. He likes movies, <br/>\nthough, so he&#39;ll watch with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s into meditation and occasionally goes to the Buddhist temple.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe loves to travel. This year, he&#39;s been to Albuquerque, NM to visit <br/>\nfriends and West VA for camp. We all went to Orlando and DisneyWorld <br/>\nfor a week in February. He&#39;s going to England and Scotland with my dad <br/>\nin September for ten days. He&#39;ll be at the conference with us in St <br/>\nLouis in October. He loves music festivals and went to Bonaroo (TN) <br/>\nwith his dad in June. He&#39;d like to do more festivals this fall; <br/>\nhopefully he can make LEAF in NC the weekend after the conference.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s REALLY busy. But this happened after months and months and months <br/>\nof lying around after we took him out of school at the end of sixth <br/>\ngrade. He did almost nothing for 18 months---just sleeping, eating, <br/>\nwatching tv, IMing on the computer, and talking on the phone. He <br/>\ndeperately needed time to heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s so exciting  to watch him do so much and be so happy. He knows he <br/>\nhas a pretty sweet life---especially when he sees the lives of some of <br/>\nhis friends---school and homework and chore lists. He&#39;s truly doing <br/>\nwhat he loves to do---almost all the time!<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that give you some idea of what all he&#39;s involved in? It&#39;s not a <br/>\n&quot;typical day&quot; but it comes close to how he has to manage his time to do <br/>\nall he wants to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":213809267,"authorName":"jlh44music","from":"&quot;jlh44music&quot; &lt;jlh44music@...&gt;","profile":"jlh44music","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Personal Passions - was Re: Teenagers","postDate":"1122418346","msgId":5849,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRjNmVyYStsNWZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMjIwMWM1OGY4YyQ3ZGZhZDBiMCQzMmJhNjQ1M0BwY2FiYTFkMzU1NTE5Zj4="},"prevInTopic":5830,"nextInTopic":5852,"prevInTime":5848,"nextInTime":5850,"topicId":5750,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... for that.

I&#39;m getting ready to submit <br/>\nmy first LOI this week, so I&#39;m finalizing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I wanted to comment on is the life long learner aspect.  Ruth, <br/>\nI&#39;m glad you wrote that, as that&#39;s how I see myself, I&#39;ve always <br/>\nliked learning new things, whether they be indepth or just passing <br/>\ninterests.  I&#39;m hoping this is what I pass on to her most of all.  I <br/>\nlove to read, my dd doesn&#39;t.  She hates math, has a very negative <br/>\nmindset towards it because of school.  So, while she&#39;s deschooling, <br/>\nand I&#39;m not working for the first time ever in my life, I&#39;m reading <br/>\nand doing things I enjoy, hoping that when she&#39;s ready, she&#39;ll move <br/>\non to some of her other interests.   Also not knowing how our town <br/>\nwill respond to our LOI, will determine how much &quot;schooly&quot; stuff we <br/>\nmay have to do (I&#39;m going to submit a narrative at the end of the <br/>\nyear, hoping they won&#39;t try to push for a standardized test, very few <br/>\nin my town homeschool, no unschoolers, one family with 2 kids in elem <br/>\nschool submit a portfolio).   So, my biggest concern, this first <br/>\nyear, is what we will actually have to provide.   Once I send my <br/>\nletter and (hopefully) hear back positively I&#39;ll relax more and move <br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to stand back and unschool.  I know it&#39;s what&#39;s best for <br/>\nour family and I have to constantly work on my attitude about it and <br/>\nrelax more!<br/>\nJann</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194903596,"authorName":"coolcrew","from":"&quot;coolcrew&quot; &lt;grayfamily9@...&gt;","profile":"ladybird579","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Personal Passions - was Re: Teenagers","postDate":"1122126201","msgId":5830,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjIwMWM1OGY4YyQ3ZGZhZDBiMCQzMmJhNjQ1M0BwY2FiYTFkMzU1NTE5Zj4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM1OGYzOCRhZDRiOTc0MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBEMTZWNDk0MT4="},"prevInTopic":5829,"nextInTopic":5849,"prevInTime":5829,"nextInTime":5831,"topicId":5750,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Sunday I ve heard this again and again, and what I find is that it s hard for me to translate my passions into anything my kids would be interested in.

You are modeling the process -<br/>\n  &quot;follow your passion&quot; - to them.  Sometimes your children will end up<br/>\n  sharing your passions, sometimes they won&#39;t.  Like reading - you might hope<br/>\n  your children will share your passion for reading - maybe they will, maybe<br/>\n  they won&#39;t.  But even if they do, they won&#39;t necessarily be interested in<br/>\n  the same reading material.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  One of my passions is dancing.  This means my dh & I are out many - 4 or 5<br/>\n  nights a week.  It takes  a lot of work to follow our passion & for me to<br/>\n  arrange playdates, sleepovers, childcare, etc for my kids.  My kids don&#39;t<br/>\n  share our passion yet.  Well, I take that back.  My daughter, Sierra, 6,<br/>\n  does love to dance.  I suspect that she will want to learn West Coast Swing<br/>\n  when she is older so she can share our specific passion with us.  I suspect<br/>\n  that my son, Quentin, 9, won&#39;t.  Maybe when he is older - who knows?  He is<br/>\n  very particular about what kind of music he enjoys listening to.  And some<br/>\n  of it includes music that we dance to.  Everything is connected :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  He  is passionate about pokemon LOL.  He mentioned the other day that he&#39;d<br/>\n  like to go to Japan because that is where Pokemon originated!  So we may<br/>\n  have to make some travel plans.   He is also passionate about his X-box<br/>\n  games and playing with his best friends.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Heather McLean<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS Unschooling  Home schooling curriculum  Home schooling high school  <br/>\n        Home schooling information  Home schooling program  Home schooling resource  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

You are modeling the process -<br/>\n&quot;follow your passion&quot; - to them.  Sometimes your children will end up<br/>\nsharing your passions, sometimes they won&#39;t.  Like reading - you might hope<br/>\nyour children will share your passion for reading - maybe they will, maybe<br/>\nthey won&#39;t.  But even if they do, they won&#39;t necessarily be interested in<br/>\nthe same reading material.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my passions is dancing.  This means my dh & I are out many - 4 or 5<br/>\nnights a week.  It takes  a lot of work to follow our passion & for me to<br/>\narrange playdates, sleepovers, childcare, etc for my kids.  My kids don&#39;t<br/>\nshare our passion yet.  Well, I take that back.  My daughter, Sierra, 6,<br/>\ndoes love to dance.  I suspect that she will want to learn West Coast Swing<br/>\nwhen she is older so she can share our specific passion with us.  I suspect<br/>\nthat my son, Quentin, 9, won&#39;t.  Maybe when he is older - who knows?  He is<br/>\nvery particular about what kind of music he enjoys listening to.  And some<br/>\nof it includes music that we dance to.  Everything is connected :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe  is passionate about pokemon LOL.  He mentioned the other day that he&#39;d<br/>\nlike to go to Japan because that is where Pokemon originated!  So we may<br/>\nhave to make some travel plans.   He is also passionate about his X-box<br/>\ngames and playing with his best friends.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather McLean<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":167822625,"authorName":"Sunday Cote","from":"&quot;Sunday Cote&quot; &lt;sundaycote@...&gt;","profile":"revsunday2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Personal Passions - was Re: Teenagers","postDate":"1122090202","msgId":5825,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM1OGYzOCRhZDRiOTc0MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBEMTZWNDk0MT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFjMS4yY2M5N2MzNC4zMDExNjM4MkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5807,"nextInTopic":5826,"prevInTime":5824,"nextInTime":5826,"topicId":5750,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Gail wrote: The absolute best advice I ever got when first unschooling was to follow my own passions.

It has steamrolled into lives for both for us all  that are <br/>\nbusy, exciting and fun!<br/>\nMy kids understand that each day is filled with possibilities because they  <br/>\nhave seen my enthusiasm and love for the things I do.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was a structured rule oriented parent who learned to trust her  children <br/>\nand allow delight to come into our lives.  This week I have 6  kids here from <br/>\nages 12-16 and today I bought lots of water  balloons and some red pool dye.  I <br/>\nreally wanted to see what the pool  would look like red and it is so cool!!  <br/>\nThree of the kids have been  in it much of the day and all of them thanked me <br/>\nfor coloring the pool.   Such a simple thing....a few dollars....a lots of fun. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t suggest things that often in the summer because it&#39;s seldom that  all <br/>\nfive will want to do the same thing....I usually say something like..&quot;.I&#39;m  <br/>\nheaded to Barnes and Noble and the pet store for awhile..anyone want to  come?&quot; <br/>\n Sometimes I&#39;ll get one or two for that trip.  Next time, it  might be my <br/>\nhusband saying..&quot;I really want to watch the shuttle go up on  Tuesday...anyone <br/>\nwant to go?&quot;  Last week, two of the boys went with him and  they plan on trying <br/>\nagain when it goes up next week.  I&#39;m a big believer in  spontaneity.  They <br/>\nalso all have different interests and at some point  we&#39;ll do something each of <br/>\nthem loves that may lead to other connections for  them. Occasionally we&#39;ll <br/>\nall do something together like the beach or dinner out  but that is less and <br/>\nless as they get older.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn the last week, either I or my husband or both of us has taken some  of the <br/>\nkids to the beach, to play miniature golf, to drive go-carts, to the  shuttle <br/>\nlaunch, to a guitar store, to Jo-Anns, to the library, to Target to buy  <br/>\nApples to Apples,  to a pizza place for dinner, to Barnes and Noble, to see  a <br/>\nmovie, to Walmart of get a frisbee, to rent movies......<br/>\n <br/>\nThe kids have played guitars, listened to music, played mulitiple monopoly  <br/>\ngames, swam in the pool, gotten henna tattoos from Brenna, used slingshots to  <br/>\nshoot berries off the tree from the top of the house, played Apples to Apples, <br/>\n played video games, played Scrabble, spent time on the computer, and had <br/>\nendless  conversations both with each other and with us.  They also stay up much  <br/>\nlater than us and I&#39;m sure have entire lives after we go to bed! :-)<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m available to take them places but I also find time to read or get on  the <br/>\ncomputer or do other things I love  (or pack which is my latest  passion <br/>\nbecause I&#39;m moving across the country in 10 days!)   <br/>\n <br/>\nI continue to believe that if a parent is excited and happy about  my  their <br/>\nown life, it can only carry over to everyone in the  family.

If they still like <br/>\nvideo games but seem bored with them, too, then get them started <br/>\nplaying online multiplayer games maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do YOU do that is interesting?<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 20, 2005, at 6:52 AM, Rose wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I read a lot of posts about babies and children under the age of 10,<br/>\n&gt; but there seems to be very little information out there for those of<br/>\n&gt; us who have teenagers. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Teenagers","postDate":"1121873141","msgId":5752,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDNzVCNTY2Qzc1QjVCNS1DRkMtNEJDQ0BNQkxLLU0yNS5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRibGt1aCtwcDh1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRibGt1aCtwcDh1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5750,"nextInTopic":5753,"prevInTime":5751,"nextInTime":5753,"topicId":5750,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Newbies come on and say what you said. <br/>\nOr they say thatmost people seem to talk about teens all teh time. What <br/>\nabout little ones? Or all of you seem to have large families, what <br/>\nabout onelies? Or most families seem to have onely one or two kids, <br/>\nwhat about large families? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not really sure what kind of info I am looking for, but my<br/>\nteenagers tend to only want to play video games yet they get bored<br/>\nwith them. My 15 yo seems to feel that something is missing, yet he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem interested in taking any kind of classes or sports,<br/>\neven for fun. I think he feels that he wants to be learning more<br/>\nadvanced &quot;stuff&quot;, but I&#39;m not sure how to go about finding<br/>\nopportunities for him to learn at this age without doing &quot;school-at-<br/>\nhome&quot;. He is interested in science, cars, and loves hard physical<br/>\nlabor (gets that from his Dad, not me).<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron went through this stage too. I think it&#39;s just the calm before <br/>\nthe storm! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nScience is a broad subject. Can you break it down to something more <br/>\nmanageable? Geology? Anatomy? Entymology? Ornithology? Zoology? <br/>\nAstronomy? Chemistry? Physics?<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt all branches of science are equally fascinating. I hate <br/>\nrocks---but Deb loves &#39;em! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCars---what about them? Design? Speed? Motors? Racing?<br/>\n<br/>\nHard, physical labor---Gardening? Building? Chopping? Toting? Picking <br/>\ncotton? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom 12.5 to 14, Cameron pretty much did nothing. Deschooling. Healing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at 17, he is soooo busy!<br/>\n<br/>\nHas he thought of starting his own business? Fifteen can do so much!<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you coming to the conference? Meeting other teens who are active <br/>\nand involved can be so helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI know some unschoolers who seem to be motivated to find activities<br/>\nthat they are interested in, but mine don&#39;t seem to have that<br/>\nmotivation. Also, our funds are very limited to do ongoing classes<br/>\nand such.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nHe still may need to heal. I thought Cameron would never come around. <br/>\nBut he started skateboarding, which led to filming, which led to <br/>\ndrumming, which is his now passion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorking is also wonderful. Cameron has met so many people (almost all <br/>\nare older). It&#39;s given him a lot of confidence and self-assurance.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95682545,"authorName":"Rose","from":"&quot;Rose&quot; &lt;rosejansen@...&gt;","profile":"rosejansen","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Teenagers","postDate":"1121867537","msgId":5750,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRibGt1aCtwcDh1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5752,"prevInTime":5749,"nextInTime":5751,"topicId":5750,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I read a lot of posts about babies and children under the age of 10, but there seems to be very little information out there for those of us who have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-709898958\">I read a lot of posts about babies and children under the age of 10, <br/>\nbut there seems to be very little information out there for those of <br/>\nus who have teenagers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not really sure what kind of info I am looking for, but my <br/>\nteenagers tend to only want to play video games yet they get bored <br/>\nwith them.
