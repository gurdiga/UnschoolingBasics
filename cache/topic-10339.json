In the past week since Courtney has been out of school Ive been able to drop a lot of the &quot;rules &quot; I felt necessary while she was in school. <br/>\n  My younger 2 will usualy fall asleep by 10 or 11 ....often much earlier . I sometimes lay down with them to encourage the process. Now that she is out of school my 6 year old does not have a bedtime. I have to be up fairly early to get Nathaniel to school so I like to be in bed by midnight. My rule is that if daddy is not up to watch her she has to be in the room with me. This way I feel safer but she is able to be up watch tv, play games, color/work on an art project. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
