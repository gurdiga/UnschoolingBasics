They also set my account to forward to a<br/>\nnon-existent yahoo account.  It was only my email via the web, not my<br/>\ncomputer....thanks goodness because that means everyone&#39;s email addresses<br/>\nwere safe!  The main thing it did to me was prevent me from getting emails<br/>\nfrom people.  The groups I am on, I can check the archives but individuals,<br/>\nI have no idea who sent what.  I will be sending out individual emails to my<br/>\nfriends for 2 reasons, 1 to warn them of this happening and 2 to see if they<br/>\nwill re-send any emails they sent to me today.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat is hard for me to understand is that no amount of spam/spyware/firewall<br/>\nprotection could have prevented this since it wasn&#39;t my computer that was<br/>\nhacked.  It simply comes down to password encryption!  I can not caution you<br/>\nall enough to pick really hard passwords for all your online accounts.  If<br/>\nyou encrypt them with symbols and numbers, it will make it harder for this<br/>\nto happen to you.  I *knew* better but had a very easy password.  Now it is<br/>\nhard for me to even remember, let alone someone else to figure out.  I will<br/>\nbe changing it every 3-6 months as well.  I will have to spend the next<br/>\nseveral days tending to my forums and sites that I have visited just to be<br/>\nsure someone doesn&#39;t use my accounts and ruin my reputation.  The likelihood<br/>\nof that happening is slim but right now I don&#39;t want to take any chances.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am so thankful for my computer geek husband because if not for him, I<br/>\nwould not have figured out what happened.  We have notified Cox of this<br/>\nissue but there is little they could do about it anyway.  I will be emailing<br/>\na word of caution to all my yahoo groups because I do not want this to<br/>\nhappen to anyone else, EVER!  Please learn from my mistake...<br/>\n <br/>\nWith Gratitude,<br/>\nChristy Putnam<br/>\nFunschooling Mom to Seth (12) and Aden (2)<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21840,"nextTopicId":21783}}
