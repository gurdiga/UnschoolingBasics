She has NLVD, TS, SPD, and ADHD.  Does the Tourettes affect your daughter a lot?  Obviously the Anxiety is a big issue for your daughter.  I&#39;m trying to figure out how hard the Tourette&#39;s is for my daughter, but I think it kind of takes a back seat to all the other issues.  Luckily we have not had other kids make fun of her (up to this point) about the TS........although some of her tics a lot of adults and kids would not recognize as a tic.  Her eye tic (eye twitching) makes it real obvious she has TS.<br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie Kowalski &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lrkowalski@...\">lrkowalski@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Yes, she definitely has anxiety issues as part of her TS (very common <br/>\nfor kids with TS to have multiple issues, as you wrote).<br/>\n<br/>\nHer anxieties are funny in that she can be supremely confident in one <br/>\narea and supremely terrified in another area.
