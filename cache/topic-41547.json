We strew toys and games, books and magazines, movies, websites, theories and questions, but most of all, possibilities. <br/>\n<br/>\nA year ago my 8yo didn&#39;t know she needed to learn programming and now she&#39;s learning about that, and learning what she needs to know to learn more. A year ago, my 15yo didn&#39;t know he needed to learn to solder and weld. A year ago, I didn&#39;t know I needed to learn to carve architectural details. A year ago, my partner didn&#39;t know he needed to learn about water filtration systems. Its Impossible to know what anyone will Need to know in the future. You can do a hundred things to prepare, but most people find they still have to do a lot of learning along the way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important thing, with all the uncertainty in life, is to know how to learn. To know what one&#39;s own process looks and feels like so learning isn&#39;t a chore, isn&#39;t something to be avoided. My teen dives headlong into things that are challenging, knowing they&#39;ll be challenging, because he has confidence in his own learning. My 8yo will break down crying when she gets frustrated, but then, half an hour later, will be back at whatever it is she&#39;s decided to do, working through her own frustrations to reach her self chosen goals. They both know that sometimes they won&#39;t have all the skills at the beginning of an endeavor, and are willing to work to discover and gain those skills. That&#39;s something &quot;getting ready for the future&quot; can undermine - can leave people with the impression that they need to Be ready to even start.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHappily, learning what you need when you need it isn&#39;t nearly as hard, or as lengthy, as learning in school makes it out to be.
