I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink it&#39;s fair for smaller creatures to suffer because you can&#39;t be<br/>\nmore creative in helping your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re still losing it, and resorting to spanking, then I would<br/>\nguess that he is simply acting out the pain that has been inflicted<br/>\nupon him, upon more helpless creatures. That happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil you get beyond the paradigm of &quot;fixing&quot; him, or hurting him to <br/>\nchange the behavior, it&#39;s going to be really difficult to come up with<br/>\nsolutions that truly help everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, I would try to spend a lot of time with him. Fill him up<br/>\nas it were. Make sure he gets a lot of attention and time BEFORE he&#39;s<br/>\nacting out. What activities bring him joy? What does he love? Focus on<br/>\nthat part of him so he can begin to feel whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there signs before he starts to act hurtfully? Does he give cues?<br/>\nAre you listening to the cues and being present when he needs help? <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is something in him that is hurting it sounds like. It IS your<br/>\njob to keep both the kittens and the younger child safe. If you can&#39;t<br/>\ndo that, then you&#39;re negating your position as a parent. That is not a<br/>\ngood environment for unschooling. Your younger child is feeling<br/>\nneglected because you aren&#39;t keeping him safe.
