Chess is pretty universal. Also, look into<br/>\n maybe some traditional &#39;craft&#39; ideas. And music - goodness, Asian style<br/>\n music is so different than Western music. All of that is *learning*<br/>\n whether or not it looks &quot;educational&quot; . Oh, and don&#39;t forget stuff like<br/>\n animation - I&#39;m sure Taiwanese versions are different than Japanese<br/>\n anime. <br/>\n  <br/>\n Deb <br/>\n***************************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nActually we have been doing a bit of origami, and the kids have these game cards which they bought at the $NT10 store (which may be the 5 and 10 you mentioned, sorry I am from South Africa so not too sure what the 5 and 10 store is), anyway, they are all in Chinese, but do have numbers in the corners in different denominations, and they have made up their own card games with these.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey do watch quite a bit of tv, and most of the programs are in Chinese, and what they tend to do after watching (especially Power Rangers), they find all the old cardboard boxes we have in the apartment, and make swords and shields with these (designing, cutting, assembling it all together, and sometimes even painting them).  As for music, my oldest is learning the guitar from my husband, although it is not Asian music.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I write all the things down here that they do, although at first glance it doesn&#39;t look very &quot;educational&quot; to me, but I guess if I take my *school glasses* off, I realise there is learning going on there....<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the suggestions....<br/>\n<br/>\n~* Starr *~<br/>\n<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
