I believe that I can trust the economy, the unpredictability<br/>\nof our neighbors or professional colleagues, the weather, our powerlessness<br/>\nover other people, the unlucky chance that leaves a nail in my driveway, and<br/>\nso on, to provide enough challenges in real life without me having to make<br/>\nup extra troubles. Being out of school will not remove these life<br/>\nchallenges, just the school based ones which are contrived.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also believe that our homes can and should be a haven from the<br/>\ntribulations of the world, especially for our children as they learn to cope<br/>\nwith their own development as well as learn about life. I don&#39;t have to<br/>\nbreak Jayn&#39;s finger to give her experience in coping with pain in case she<br/>\nbreaks her arm one day - I would rather help her keep her fingers safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also don&#39;t want her to think of her home life as something she will<br/>\neventually be able to escape from, which I believe is a prevalent attitude<br/>\namongst conventionally schooled and parented children. I have a couple of<br/>\nlittle neighbors who, at the ages of 7 and 5, are already trying to escape<br/>\nover here as often as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut aside from that I believe that the idea that life *should* be hard, that<br/>\nsuffering is ennobling, is erroneous - a mythic paradigm stemming from some<br/>\nreligions, and a jolly good excuse to not help people in poverty or trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer to live with the paradigm that although life sometimes has<br/>\nchallenges, our true selves and our higher nature lie in the pursuit of<br/>\nhappiness. Certainly tragedies occur, people do have real and serious<br/>\nproblems, and hubris makes great drama. However a life of joy is not an<br/>\nearned reward, but a philosophical choice. And if troubles lie around the<br/>\ncorner for our kids, at least we can give them as much joy now so that they<br/>\nface these troubles from a place of strength and love. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;(2)The other response to our ourschooling decision came from an <br/>\nacquaintance who is in a high management position in business.

Not a single person on this list, can share those  same <br/>\nexperiences in the same way, so how could someone who doesn&#39;t *get*  unschooling even <br/>\nbegin to see my point of view?<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, when someone out there is giving you their opinion, that is exactly  what <br/>\nit is....an opinion.  A commonly held one, yes, but it is still an  opinion.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for things being &quot;too easy&quot;, that is exactly what you are doing!  I  want <br/>\nit to BE EASY for my children to learn.  I call it the &quot;optimal brain&quot;  <br/>\nlearning system.  You are releasing your child from all the boredom,  competition, <br/>\nstress, anxiety, and personal sacrifice (you can&#39;t eat when you are  hungry, <br/>\nsleep when you are tired, go to the toilet, etc.) that goes along with  school.  <br/>\nThat makes it HARD to learn.  Add to that, having to read  when you want to <br/>\nplay, play when you want to read, do math when you weren&#39;t done  with science <br/>\nand it is amazing to me that kids learn in school at all.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut that&#39;s the point.  Kids learn.  Period.  If the human  brain didn&#39;t <br/>\nlearn, our species wouldn&#39;t be here.  Why confuse something  that is one of the <br/>\nmost basic of human functions?  Why wouldn&#39;t I give my  child the world and say <br/>\n&quot;go forth and learn&quot; instead of locking (yes, locking)  him away in a building <br/>\nwith lots of enforced rules about how, why, when, what he  learns?<br/>\n <br/>\nSchool is like that game show they had on Comedy Central  (Distraction???).  <br/>\nThey would ask people simple questions but would be  doing something so <br/>\ndistracting to them, it was really hard for them to  answer.  Things like going <br/>\n&quot;lalalalalalalalalalalalala&quot; in their ear.  <br/>\n <br/>\n******(2)The other response to our ourschooling decision came from an  <br/>\nacquaintance who is in a high management position in business. Her  <br/>\nemphasis was that children like all people need to have expectations <br/>\nset  of them. She feels that unless high expectations are set, people <br/>\ndo not try  to do well.**********<br/>\n <br/>\nFirst of all, your friend may have lots of experience with SCHOOLED people  <br/>\nthat don&#39;t do well unless they have expectation placed on them.  I&#39;m quite  <br/>\nsure she doesn&#39;t know any unschooled people.  And I doubt an unschooler  would <br/>\nwant to work in such an environment anyway.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere was a book a couple of years ago (can someone help me?  ack)  that <br/>\ndiscussed that the future of business would be the free agent, not the  corporate <br/>\nguy.  He compared the homeschooling community to this new  spirit of business. <br/>\n This book received high praise.  I believe  it....I think the age of the <br/>\ngiant corporation is fading.  They can&#39;t  support themselves and their inflated <br/>\nbudgets.  We need innovators and  people who know how to work for themselves, <br/>\nnot people that know only how to do  what they are told.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy children are relatively young, but I am amazed at the expectations they  <br/>\nhave for themselves.  They decide they want to do something and they set up  <br/>\nparameters and work and work.  If things aren&#39;t going as planned, they  change <br/>\ntheir parameters or revisit it later with new info. or skills or  scrap the <br/>\nproject.  There are moments of frustration, but no one is shaming  them or <br/>\ngrading them or expecting more from them.  Their self-esteem is in  one piece and <br/>\nthey move on to the next idea they have dreamed up.  <br/>\n <br/>\nLife has a way of moving you on.  As soon as you have risen to one  <br/>\nchallenge, another presents itself.  A childhood of happily moving  from challenge to <br/>\nchallenge, and getting to choose most of them (some things,  like illness, are <br/>\nbeyond our control), will result in a person who will meet  adulthood in the <br/>\nsame manner.  On their own terms and to their own  satisfaction.<br/>\n <br/>\nA person who has expectations set for them, will spend their life stressing  <br/>\nover meeting or exceeding these expectations and always with other people in  <br/>\nmind.  That is a life lived for others, and that person&#39;s happiness  will  <br/>\ndepend on what someone else thinks of them.  And the title  beneath his name <br/>\nmight hold more importance than who he is as a  person.  <br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC (sorry so long, I got on a  roll!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196090915,"authorName":"J.

Other issues are your own private business - as his how your child learns -  and nothing to do with your mother tbh.  My mother had similar concerns to.lol<br/>\n<br/>\n  In response to child need expectations set on them well I can only comment on my own personal family but my eldest son has been unschooled for 4 years and has decided off his own back to apply for a online university place and has just been offered one two years ahead of age time.  I have never pressured him this route or pushed or taught him. He did it himself.  I think the opposite is true. Setting expectations can cause untold stress and pressure and it is up to the individual child how they want to learn and what.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Ruth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Yahoo!

I am reading the literature and am on <br/>\nseveral lists. This certainly seems right for our family. My son is <br/>\nhappy. My husband is convinced. Yet I remain fairly anxious. As I am <br/>\ncontending with my own deschooling and rethinking what seemed like my <br/>\nown positive experience with education, I contend with people outside <br/>\nof the homeschooling community and their responses to our choice. I <br/>\nthought I would put out two of the responses I received thatlingered <br/>\nin my mind. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(1)The first was from (of all people) my mother. Of the concerns she <br/>\nraised, the one that I have thought about the most is the idea that <br/>\nwe are just making things too easy for our son by dropping out of the <br/>\neducation track. (These seems to be a refrain in her general worry <br/>\nabout other aspects of our parenting approach: such as not <br/>\ncircumcizing our son, not restrictng his food, not forcing him to <br/>\nplay sports.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(2)The other response to our ourschooling decision came from an <br/>\nacquaintance who is in a high management position in business.

I think that my <br/>\nconcern is not just about how to respond to people&#39;s criticisms but <br/>\nhow to address those cultural influences that remain voices inside of <br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nI live in PA where there aren&#39;t many true unschoolers and could use <br/>\nsome assistance.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nAndrea</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5631,"nextTopicId":5635}}
