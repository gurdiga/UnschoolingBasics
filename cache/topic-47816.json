I will add advice from my good friend who head of the Children&#39;s hospital emerg up here in Canada (which is in alignment with the Dr. Sears link offered) that fever is a symptom/reaction and not a tool. The body is fighting regardless of whether you manage the fever. Note Dr. Sears does not recommend put your child in a tepid bath without resetting the internal thermastat with medication first. The shivering raises their temp and can be dangerous. I have personally worked with mentally disabled youth that are now brain damaged due to a febrile seizure (seizures caused by fever) however not all febrile seizures cause brain damage and not all fevers will cause seizures. Nor do all fevers require intervention. If your child is sleeping and the fever is below the temp noted in another post. Then watch and wait. Concern is when it is not disappearing in a couple of days or shivering is occuring causing a rise in temp. You need to monitor and determine if your child needs intervention. Trust your mother&#39;s intuition - that little voice that says &quot;this is wrong&quot;. As far as a child adverse to medication administration, this is can be hidden. Get a dye free/flavourless liquid and mix it in pudding or jello or applesauce. I tell my 3 boys I&#39;m hiding it - so there isn&#39;t sneaking going on. &quot;I know the taste and texture is yucky, but how can we sneak it past your mouth?&quot; They have great ideas! However I have had a REALLY sick child during H1N1 scare that I put it in a syringe and squirted it in the back of his throat without asking or making a big deal. He was so sick and barely conscious that he didn`t fight me. That`s how I knew he NEEDED to get that fever down!<br/>\nGood luck - this is a tough area to navigate.<br/>\nStacey</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"Debra Rossing &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"scoopmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Fever Medication","postDate":"1325259494","msgId":47822,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE2MDREOUJDRjA0MEI0NDA5MjMxQzkyOTg0N0RERUU4MzUxQjRCNDhAVU5JQkxBQi5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47821,"nextInTopic":47823,"prevInTime":47821,"nextInTime":47823,"topicId":47816,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My rule of thumb has always been (a) above 102, start considering treating (yes, before it gets to the danger 104 zone) (b) if DS wants medication, then","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1477879058\">My rule of thumb has always been (a) above 102, start considering treating (yes, before it gets to the &quot;danger&quot; 104 zone) (b) if DS wants medication, then definitely. The thing is, he&#39;s almost always (as far back as he remembers) had full choice in the subject of things like OTC meds. We&#39;ll check his temp and talk. If it&#39;s 101 and he feels awful, he might opt for something then again he might just curl up and go to sleep for a while. If there are other symptoms, that&#39;s another part of the discussion too - he won&#39;t take a multi symptom med that covers more than what he has (if he has fever and nasal congestion, that&#39;s all he wants meds for, none of the fever, cough, congestion stuff). Sometimes he&#39;ll have more cool beverage, sleep a bit, and a couple hours later we reasses. Generally speaking, if it hasn&#39;t dropped in several hours/checks, he&#39;ll likely be wanting something so I check the options ahead of time - do we have a plain fever reducer that he prefers, do we have a couple multi symptom meds, are there other symptoms appearing and what do we have for that, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the issues with DS is taste - medicine tastes mediciney after all LOL. When he was a toddler, using the infant type dropper and squirting it in was helpful in bypassing the tastebuds mostly. Now that he&#39;s older (still can&#39;t handle swallowing pills like DH), I pour the dose of medication and a BIG glass of water or juice. He downs the med with one hand then takes a big gulp of the other to wash away the taste.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb R<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
