Really hard to watch the floundering, but I will step back.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n There is a related issue: that of well meaning friends and family who are plugged into the typical pressure cooker high school life of  more, more and more accomplishments, high grades, and activities - or else a young person fails at life...  These people, unfortunately my ex included, believe my son is not doing enough .  That since he turned 16, he should be super kid:  have the job, take the classes, be in sports, do internships, be a model citizen, etc, etc, etc.  Or he will not succeed.<br/>\nUnfortunately, my son feels this stress, and so do I often.  I have overcome the frustration of trying to explain unschooling to those who are not familiar with it. And I have learned to let go of any kind of time frame. Whether he graduates college at 22 or 30, or at all...<br/>\nHowever, I think adding to my son&#39;s stress about the algebra course is the fact that his father sees what he is doing as &#39;not enough&#39;  and compares him to his friends&#39; teens who are on this high achievement tract, which he views as the norm, and the preferable path. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I am just ranting!

The one constant is a shifting and changing balance of when to offer advice, when to be quiet, when to hug and when to step back.  Sometimes they&#39;ll let me know clearly with language, sometimes by just saying &quot;no thanks&quot; quite a bit . . . Their approach and method of working towards a goal is SO different than the way I would do it.   Most days I revel in the way they do things, some days, tho, it&#39;s frustrating for me and looks like &quot;nothing&quot; is happening.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Ann</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] time management","postDate":"1267616969","msgId":43271,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4MTM2LjQwMzg5LnFtQHdlYjg2MjA3Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDYwMjUzOC4zNjE3MS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwOC5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGhtazFwZytoMGV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NjAyNTM4LjM2MTcxLnFtQHdlYjg2MjA4Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43270,"nextInTopic":43273,"prevInTime":43270,"nextInTime":43272,"topicId":43267,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There is a missing transitional sentence, or word.
