Then each person in the tribe<br/>\nspeaks to the accused, one at a time, each recalling the good things the<br/>\nperson in the center of the circle has done in his lifetime. Every incident,<br/>\nevery experience that can be recalled with any detail and accuracy, is<br/>\nrecounted. All his positive attributes, good deeds, strengths, and<br/>\nkindnesses are recited carefully and at length. This tribal ceremony often<br/>\nlasts for several days. At the end, the tribal circle is broken, a joyous<br/>\ncelebration takes place, and the person is symbolically and literally<br/>\nwelcomed back into the tribe... as the Buddha said: Hatred will never cease<br/>\nby hatred.
