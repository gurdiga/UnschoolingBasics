I posted in late spring about my 9 yr. old daughter who returned to homeschooling after 1 1/2 yrs. in public school and how emotional she was at times, even when I was trying to be less restrictive, etc.  Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that she is doing better.  (Not perfect, since we all have emotional times and conflicts.)  I do think that using a less authoritarian/dogmatic approach with her has helped.  And, she is starting to express appreciation for my efforts to help her obtain the some of the things she wants, even if I can&#39;t give her everything she wants.  She also is starting to help more spontaneously as well.  Not as much as I would like,  but more than before.  I still have to work on my attitude about the amount of work I do around the house compared to the rest of the family, but I do find that the less I complain the more helpful they are.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo thanks everyone for your suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44627,"nextTopicId":44661}}
