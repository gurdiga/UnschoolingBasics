You can also use body language to communicate if one child Wants something while another wants to talk - point and make a &quot;questioning&quot; face, or hold out a hand if you see a child has an object. Then you may also be able to interject a quick question as an aside without more than pausing the flow of the speaker.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might also help to shift your priorities from answering in order of age to something else - it doesn&#39;t have to be the same criterion each time, and it will depend on what sorts of things they want to tell you. If one child tends to be long-winded, for instance, it might be better to hear what others have to say first. Or if one child wants to show you something you could be looking while listening to someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] When everyone talks at once...","postDate":"1334926483","msgId":48372,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdGNjc2RTQyLUYwQTQtNDY3MS1CMkRELTU1RTM2NEQ0RTEyRUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGptcXFkbiszdGVoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGptcXFkbiszdGVoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48369,"nextInTopic":48374,"prevInTime":48371,"nextInTime":48373,"topicId":48369,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Some of the requests of the younger the older kids might be able to help with. Some of the tasks can be broken down into simpler things the younger could help with, like grabbing some paper towels for a spill. The ones you&#39;re doing something for are more likely to be willing to do something for another one, especially if it frees you up to help them ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237699340,"authorName":"messy_boys","from":"&quot;messy_boys&quot; &lt;messy_boys@...&gt;","profile":"messy_boys","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"When everyone talks at once...","postDate":"1334897911","msgId":48369,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGptcXFkbiszdGVoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48372,"prevInTime":48368,"nextInTime":48370,"topicId":48369,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I need some ideas on how to handle my littles when everyone wants to ask me something or tell me something at the same time.
