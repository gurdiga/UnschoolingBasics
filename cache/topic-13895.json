LOL  When we started, we would spend all weekend, every weekend, hunting down caches. ;o)  We&#39;ve even placed a few of our own.  It&#39;s fun to see the log entries on the site and read about people&#39;s adventures trying to find your cache.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a GREAT way to find all sorts of really cool out of the way places.  When we go on roadtrips, we always print out a bunch of geocache listings and cache our way to and from our location.  It makes the trips more enjoyable and gives us an excuse to stop and stretch their legs.
