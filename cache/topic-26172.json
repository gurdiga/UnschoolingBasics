I know that when a room is cluttered or really messy it can be<br/>\noverwhelming to clean it - where do you start?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am imagining the joy and relief the girl felt when she came home<br/>\nto a tidy room, and then the betrayal and sadness and anger that must<br/>\nhave replaced that joy when she learned it was all done in retribution<br/>\nand that her belongings were in the garbage and her space had been<br/>\nviolated in such a mean-spirited way. You&#39;re right, it is so sad.
