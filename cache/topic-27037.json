So Then I was left to figure out a girls name.<br/>\nMany were rolled over the tongue, a few jotted down and tasted a few times, none grabbed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen one day when I was about six months along, we were discussing names and her father came up with <br/>\nCaylee.  So being me, I asked my baby-to-be if she liked the name Caylee.  It was the ONLY time I got this <br/>\npositive rap, kinda like saying,&#39;Yes! Yes!  That&#39;s my name!&#39; So she is named.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: wisdomalways5 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wisdom1133@...\">wisdom1133@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, October 12, 2007 1:48:16 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: What is the difference between Unschoolers and Radical Unschoolers?<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad you like it- yes use it<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com, Vickisue Gray <br/>\n&lt;vickisue_gray@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; May I post this to my Blog!!!!<br/>\n&gt; This is the best definition EVER!<br/>\n&gt; WoW!

I was recently talking about having a movie night on one of my local homeschooling groups.  One woman (who says she is a radical unschooler) said that she probably would not come because she is really picky about what her kids watch.  That just confused the heck out of me.  I&#39;d imagine unschoolers/radical unschoolers are like the rest of the planet, a diverse bunch, but limiting tv/and radical unschooling just did not seem to go in the same sentence to me.  And of course it got me thinking about what the difference between radical unschoolers and unschoolers is.  Of course if I asked a 100 people, I would probably get a 100 different answers.  It seems everyone I talk to has a different view on exactly what Unschooling is.<br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nwisdomalways5 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wisdom1133@...\">wisdom1133@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kellmar98&quot; &lt;kellmar98@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I get what the basic differences are.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kelly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Basically an unschooler is a homeschooler who does not use &quot;text books&#39; <br/>\nto learn but generally are more traditional in other areas of say tv, <br/>\ncomputer time, bedtine, chores, friends, styles stuff like that<br/>\n<br/>\nRadical unschooling is trusting your child in ALL areas of life not <br/>\njust schooling- they eat when hungry and sleep when tired and &quot;learn&quot; <br/>\nby living daily life.
