Asperger&#39;s Disorder in the only diagnosis that falls into the category of Pervasive Development Disorders.  Tourette&#39;s Disorder falls into the category of Tic Disorders, and ADHD falls into a specific category of Attention-deficit and Disruptive Behaviour Disorders (labels are so disquieting).  The broader labels (PDD, Tic, Attention-deficit) all fall under a specific classification of childhood disorders (Disorders Usually First Diagnosed In Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence).
