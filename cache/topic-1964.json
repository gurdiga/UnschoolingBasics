Well I haven&#39;t heard the term Joyful disruption before, but I have done that plenty, and you are right that it should work well in this situation.  Guess I was too busy being bothered to think of it...good idea, thanks!<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nHave you read about &quot;joyful disruptions?&quot; This might be a good use of <br/>\nthat kind of response - or at least something verbally imaginative.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, he says, &quot;No, don&#39;t eat cereal,&quot; and you say, &quot;It isn&#39;t <br/>\ncereal - I&#39;m eating a big bowl of juicy fat WORMS. YUM YUM YUM.&quot; He <br/>\nsays, &quot;Mommy, don&#39;t take a shower,&quot; and you say, &quot;Well, if I don&#39;t <br/>\nwe&#39;re going to be able to plant seeds all over my skin, I&#39;ll be so <br/>\ndirty, and then the seeds will grow into plants and I will be a walking <br/>\nforest.&quot; Etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould work - having a sense of humor really helps a lot with parenting. <br/>\nYou just have to be careful that it doesn&#39;t come across as teasing or <br/>\nmaking fun of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, I&#39;ll be listening to other responses, because I also do not <br/>\nat ALL handle it well when I feel like somebody is ordering me around. <br/>\nIt pushes all my buttons, too. I&#39;m sure there will be others here with <br/>\nsome great insight and we&#39;ll both learning something!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
