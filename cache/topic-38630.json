Its <br/>\nokay if it takes another year or two (or changes his mind entirely). <br/>\nIf you&#39;re wanting to be helpful in a proactive way, keep looking into <br/>\noptions around the idea using a portfolio rather than something more <br/>\nstructured for admissions. Maybe look into enrolling with some kind <br/>\nof &quot;umbrella school&quot; that will issue y&#39;all a diploma - some are very <br/>\nfamiliar with unschoolers and eclectic homeschoolers and will help <br/>\nyou turn what you do into something that you can use with the Navy, <br/>\nfor example. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve told him that whatever he needs, be it test prep study <br/>\n </span></blockquote>materials<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or books or anything that all he has to do is ask.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good. There&#39;s lots of time. Step away from the idea of materials, now <br/>\nand help him look for more things that appeal to him right now. He&#39;s <br/>\nnot into sports - how does he feel about things like juggling or <br/>\nskateboarding? Alternately, how does he feel about things like <br/>\npottery or metalworking? Those are some of my 15yos interests, which <br/>\nis why they come to mind, but they&#39;re all fantastically physical, <br/>\neven if they aren&#39;t &quot;sports&quot;. Maybe look into summer camps or <br/>\nscouting, too - organized ways to participate in what are, <br/>\nessentially, individual sports like hiking or canoeing (sp?) or rock <br/>\nclimbing. If you ds just isn&#39;t interested in doing things with his <br/>\nbody, eventually he&#39;s going to figure out that the military isn&#39;t a <br/>\ngood fit for him. Its okay if he takes awhile to figure that out, <br/>\nthough.

That said, how do you avoid the pitfall of not feeling that if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t push your child to learn that you&#39;ve failed them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis question mostly pertains to our 14yo son. He&#39;s a wonderful young<br/>\nman. For over a year now, he keeps talking about dual enrolling at the<br/>\ncommunity college when he&#39;s 16 (we haven&#39;t told him he &#39;has to&#39; and<br/>\nboth hubby and I have said it is his choice) and then joining the<br/>\nmilitary. We told him that he should do what he wants when it comes to<br/>\nall of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy &quot;concern&quot;...He speaks very passionately about both of those and,<br/>\ntogether, we&#39;ve looked at what needs to be done to accomplish them.<br/>\nThe Navy wants a &quot;diploma&quot; and &quot;credits&quot; and preferably &quot;sports&quot;--Zak<br/>\nis not into sports at all. We&#39;re having trouble finding out exactly<br/>\nwhat the Air Force requires (he doesn&#39;t want to join the Marines or<br/>\nArmy). Also, he doesn&#39;t want to write, spend time with grammar, or do<br/>\nscience projects. However, he loves reading about history from time to<br/>\ntime, finances and real estate. There just isn&#39;t any &quot;work&quot; to show<br/>\nfor it aside from me listing the books he&#39;s read.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for community college, he doesn&#39;t want to prepare for that either<br/>\nby learning what will be required to even get his foot in the door,<br/>\ni.e.; Florida FCAT, Clepping, portfolio. I can add books he&#39;s read and<br/>\ntv shows that he&#39;s watched and also a few community projects he&#39;s<br/>\ndone--but I don&#39;t know if it will be enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s such a wonderful young man. My mountain is trying to get over<br/>\n&quot;stories&quot; where people say, &quot;Thank goodness my parents/teacher/adult<br/>\npushed me to get good grades and study hard or I never would have made<br/>\nit through life!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve told him that whatever he needs, be it test prep study materials<br/>\nor books or anything that all he has to do is ask. He can partake in<br/>\nsports, volunteer, ask to be an apprentice, and more. Is that enough?<br/>\nI&#39;m worried that if he isn&#39;t able to get into college or the military<br/>\n(he may change his mind but it&#39;s been set for a long time and that&#39;s<br/>\nnever happened before) that he&#39;ll one day blame me for not pushing<br/>\nhim--it&#39;s a major fear for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven though I know what he needs to do, I dread the thought of saying,<br/>\n&quot;You said you want to go to college so it&#39;s time to take it seriously.<br/>\nFrom now on, everyday we&#39;re going to do &quot;x, y and z&quot; to get you there.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much for your time.<br/>\n<br/>\nRespectfully ~ Sandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38629,"nextTopicId":38631}}
