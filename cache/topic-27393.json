When she was sensitive to something he would be able<br/>\nto push my arm down and when she wasn&#39;t, my arm stayed strong and<br/>\nresistant.  I didn&#39;t believe it until I was actually experiencing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the treatment, he said that kids don&#39;t need needles because their veins<br/>\nand stuff are more near the skin than adults.  Anyway, he &quot;scratched&quot; Lilly<br/>\nin 8 places (elbow area on both arms, thumb area on both hands, near the big<br/>\ntoe on both feet and above the ankle on both sides).  That realigned her chi<br/>\nI guess.  All I know is that things have been a TON easier since she has had<br/>\nthe treatments.  He told me that when she gets angry I can do the treatment<br/>\nat home as well and I have and it has calmed her down.  If you google<br/>\naccupuncture you might be able to find the exact places to &quot;scratch&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that was calming for her was rubbing her ears.  Supposedly<br/>\nevery part of your body is linked to a place on your ear.  This was very<br/>\nhelpful to her as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.  I am really not an expert though and I would advise you to<br/>\ncall your local accupuncturist.

Especially the things he<br/>\nsays to you when he&#39;s angry. I have a pretty intense 4.5 yr. old boy<br/>\nhere. He says those exact words pretty much daily, or at least when<br/>\nhe&#39;s upset. He has a younger sis (2.5) that he has tolerated for the<br/>\nfirst 2.25 yrs of her life. She recently became the more strong-willed<br/>\nof the two (pretty much how he was emotionally at her age) and has<br/>\nbegun driving him to some pretty strong reactions. It&#39;s not fun. It<br/>\ngets me pretty worked up sometimes (unfortunately), and I have begun<br/>\nyelling at him to go in his room :(<br/>\nIt sounds like you are doing a great job already, keeping things<br/>\nlight-hearted and all. That is the hardest part, our own reactions. <br/>\nI have been trying to give DS some one-on-one time doing something he<br/>\nloves (art, usually), and it helps. I also try to keep him fed and<br/>\nbusy. These two things are important around here. My kids are<br/>\nfree-feeders, but my son seems to forget to eat, or wants me to make<br/>\nsomething when I am in the middle of something else. <br/>\nI also try to keep his sis busy. If she is pushing his buttons, I<br/>\ndivert her attention (hard for me, since I expect her to do this<br/>\nherself--I know, I forget she&#39;s 2.5 sometimes!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the most important thing I can offer is empathy. I absolutely<br/>\nfeel your frustrations having an intense kiddo myself. This is such a<br/>\ntough age. So much is being learned. Independence is really growing in<br/>\nso many ways.

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1021637244\">My wonderful middle daughter was like this at 4 years old. Really  <br/>\nsuper super intense, easily angered, very big outbursts over  <br/>\nseemingly little things. I worried for years about her ability to  <br/>\ncope with the normal difficulties of life. She&#39;s 20 now and she&#39;s  <br/>\nfine. Still intense. Still feels things very very strongly. Still  <br/>\nsuper sensitive and easily hurt and that hurt still shows itself as  <br/>\nanger (but her anger is no longer in the form of extreme outbursts,  <br/>\nshe handles herself beautifully, and is able to channel her strong  <br/>\nemotions into productive directions).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, accept it that there will be no magic &quot;thing&quot; you can do to  <br/>\nchange him. The more you accept him as he is, the more you&#39;ll be able  <br/>\nto help him. Get really serious about appreciating the way he is --  <br/>\nuse different vocabulary even in your own head. Don&#39;t think of him as  <br/>\n&quot;unreasonable,&quot; for example, or &quot;demanding.&quot; Change those words  <br/>\ninside your own head to, &quot;high expectations&quot; and &quot;idealistic.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, focus on supporting him, not on fixing him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI KNOW this sounds impossible. My intense child has an older and a  <br/>\nyounger sibling and I really do KNOW what you face in practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - your daughter is in her room with a friend and your son is  <br/>\nscreaming and banging on the door. In your head, you have a tendency  <br/>\nto think, &quot;He is SO rude, so unreasonable, so stubborn,  <br/>\nso...whatever.&quot;  Stop yourself and think from his point of view - he  <br/>\nis what? He LOVES to be with his sister and her friend so much. He  <br/>\nloves to be part of what&#39;s going on. He loves the stimulation of a  <br/>\nnew and different person in the house. He adores his sister and feels  <br/>\ncut off when he has to share her. He feels rejected and put down by  <br/>\nnot being included. His feelings are hurt AND he doesn&#39;t have  <br/>\nperspective and feels like she will ALWAYS be rejecting him from now  <br/>\non and that he&#39;ll always feel this hurt. And, to top it all off, his  <br/>\nmother, whom he counts on to fulfill his needs, doesn&#39;t seem to even  <br/>\nhalfway understand his needs and doesn&#39;t seem to care and is NOT  <br/>\ntrying to help him, but is judging him as being bad (even if you  <br/>\ndon&#39;t say it, he knows it). So now add a background sense of shame to  <br/>\nthe whole scenario, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - now your thinking is realistic. That is a big step. It changes  <br/>\nthe dynamics. It makes your own behavior result from trying to do  <br/>\nwhat is good for the kids, rather than responding to frustrations and  <br/>\nfears that your son&#39;s behavior triggers in you. It&#39;ll help prevent  <br/>\nyou from aggravating the problem by your own reactions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBreathe a few very deep slow breaths. Get your thinking back to basic  <br/>\nprinciples. What principles are important here? An important one is  <br/>\nthat your daughter has a right to safety (from harassment) in her own  <br/>\nhome. Speak that idea in words your son can understand, but don&#39;t  <br/>\nexpect him to respond or care. You might speak it a thousand times in  <br/>\nthe next 10 years or so. It helps to say it out loud so that you are  <br/>\nfocused on the principle, but it is what you do that really gets the  <br/>\nidea across.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce things have progressed to the point of a hysterical child  <br/>\nscreaming and banging on the door, out of control, you have to handle  <br/>\nit the best you can. It might come down to you carrying a screaming  <br/>\nand hitting child away from the door, into another room, and forcibly  <br/>\nkeeping him in there until he is calm, always using the least  <br/>\npossible amount of force. This should have to happen to you more than  <br/>\na time or two, though, before YOU learn to head it off. Again, when  <br/>\nthese situations arise, we deal with them best we can, trying to keep  <br/>\nour thinking clear and stay focused on the basic principles we want  <br/>\nto live by. But the most important thing isn&#39;t so much how you deal  <br/>\nwith that situation, it is that you learn from it so that it doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nhappen over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is really NO good outcome once that kind of situation is  <br/>\nentrenched. You have to think back to before the situation started  <br/>\nand figure out what you could have done to have prevented it. Don&#39;t  <br/>\nsay that there is no way, don&#39;t say it is unpredictable, don&#39;t say  <br/>\nthat you did what you could have done. We can give you lots of ideas,  <br/>\nbut you have to have an attitude of willingness to set things up so  <br/>\nthey work well for your family, even if other people might think  <br/>\nyou&#39;re going overboard to accommodate your son&#39;s behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - you don&#39;t invite a friend over for your daughter again without a  <br/>\nprior plan for your son, right? Because you know, for sure, that is  <br/>\nnot workable. Don&#39;t set up situations that you know are problematic.  <br/>\nMake a list of a lot of different options. Son goes to play at a  <br/>\nfriend&#39;s house, your daughter and her friend play at the park, your  <br/>\ndaughter goes to friend&#39;s house instead of friend at your house, you  <br/>\nhave a friend of your son&#39;s over at the same time, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt won&#39;t be forever - he&#39;s four and that is a relatively explosive  <br/>\ntime of life for most kids, and an extremely intense time of life for  <br/>\nthose who have that personality. But it is good practice for you -  <br/>\nyou have to practice thinking ahead and setting up his environment so  <br/>\nthat he can be successful and happy. That is a way of thinking that  <br/>\nwill help you as an unschooling parent and in many other ways with  <br/>\nother people, too. You&#39;ll thank him later for making it necessary for  <br/>\nyou to learn so much.

In August she started Head Start (I hadn&#39;t read<br/>\nabout homeschooling much less unschooling) but before that especially,<br/>\nwe had a really hard time being together all the time.  She would lay<br/>\nin the floor and kick and scream, at the drop of a hat.  My husband<br/>\n(her stepdad) gets really angry when she starts screaming, especially<br/>\nwhen our baby boy is sleeping, (and since DH is a night owl he&#39;s<br/>\nalways trying to sleep through the day) and it&#39;s been really hard to<br/>\nfind a solution that will help the entire family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLately she has become a little sweetie pie.  She keeps her room picked<br/>\nup and even cleans the living room, without being asked.  She&#39;s not<br/>\nbeen needing constant attention and will go in her room and color for<br/>\nan hour at a time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of what has happened is that she&#39;s going to Head Start for 4<br/>\nhours a day, so she has somewhere to be every day and is really<br/>\nenjoying it.  (I am not saying that you should do the same thing, as a<br/>\nmatter of fact I have a lot of regrets about sending her there before<br/>\nreading up on homeschooling.  This is just a theory on why she&#39;s all<br/>\nof a sudden so peaceful.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have started to validate her emotions.  This is when the<br/>\npeacefulness really began, almost immediately.  She still has a<br/>\nmeltdown sometimes, which goes like:<br/>\n<br/>\nDD:  Mommy, I need you to get me a piece of tape.<br/>\nMe:  I&#39;m nursing your brother right now, he&#39;s almost asleep, if you&#39;ll<br/>\ngive me just a min--<br/>\nDD:  *shrieking meltdown before I can get the words out*<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore, I would have gotten out of my chair with the sleepy brother,<br/>\nand spanked her, and screamed back.  (I&#39;m not proud of this.  It&#39;s<br/>\nvery hard to admit.)  I would have been infuriated.  Now, I understand<br/>\nwhy she&#39;s doing this.  It&#39;s because of all the times I said, &quot;In a<br/>\nminute,&quot; and didn&#39;t use some follow-through.  Now, I try to get<br/>\nthrough the screams by saying:  &quot;Sweetie, come here.  Okay.  You&#39;re<br/>\nangry that I can&#39;t get up right now to go get the tape for you?  And<br/>\nyou&#39;re afraid that when I say &#39;in a minute&#39; that I don&#39;t mean it?&quot; <br/>\nThen I assure her that if she will only wait a minute, we can have<br/>\nspecial one-on-one time, because then her brother will be asleep.  She<br/>\nwalks away sniffling but consoled.<br/>\n<br/>\nDD has also been very impatient over getting what she wants to eat or<br/>\ndrink RIGHT NOW at this second, and I&#39;ve found that if I&#39;m in the<br/>\nmiddle of making it, I&#39;ll say, &quot;I&#39;m making it.&quot;  If after saying that,<br/>\nshe&#39;s still panicking, I would try one of two things.  1) you can try<br/>\nvalidating his emotions again-- &quot;It&#39;s hard to wait on something to eat<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re hungry and want something in your belly already.&quot;  or 2) <br/>\nThis is probably my old method, but in this case I think being silent<br/>\n for about 30 seconds while you finish making it would be acceptable.<br/>\n  My dd senses my tension and when I try to exasperatedly tell her to<br/>\njust be patient, she will start raging.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso recognize that if he has a lot of pent-up anger, he needs to be<br/>\nable to express that.  Maybe you could work with him to find out where<br/>\nit&#39;s coming from and healthier ways to express it than beating on his<br/>\nsister&#39;s door.  Maybe explain to him that his sister has started to<br/>\nnot want to play with him at all because of the way he&#39;s been acting,<br/>\nand that if he could get out the frustration without actively<br/>\ndisturbing her that she&#39;d be more likely to WANT to spend time with<br/>\nhim.  The way to get someone to WANT to be with you is not to scream<br/>\nat them and bang on their door.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Note:  I am new at all this stuff, and part of me is asking myself,<br/>\n&quot;Why do you think YOU can give advice?&quot;  But we&#39;ve had a huge<br/>\nbreakthrough, it&#39;s been mostly due to my change in perspective.  I<br/>\nhope this helps even a bit.  I hope it&#39;s not all TOO obvious.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":314099889,"authorName":"Jamie Murray","from":"&quot;Jamie Murray&quot; &lt;CAHOLO@...&gt;","profile":"calicomama2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] intense & very strong willed 4 year old","postDate":"1193589742","msgId":27402,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTgwMWM4MTk4MSQ4NDEwNWU4MCQwN2IwYjk0M0Boc2QxLndhLmNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDY3MzczMWQ1ZjA1ODc5N2YyNDBkZDdjYmE4N2IwYzIxQHR3Y255LnJyLmNvbT4gPDdBMkQ5MUMxLUMzRUUtNERCMy1BOEE0LTMyMUJCOUI4MEMyREB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":27399,"nextInTopic":27405,"prevInTime":27401,"nextInTime":27403,"topicId":27393,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you too, as I will look into these too.

My daughter is 10 and my son is 4.  Here is the problem that <br/>\nI just can&#39;t figure out how to handle.  DS is very intense and <br/>\nextremely strong willed (which I do admire ~ really).  On a daily <br/>\nbasis, there is meltdown, tantrums and anger, throwing things, etc.   <br/>\nSome of the reasons for any of these could be that I can&#39;t make a <br/>\nsandwich for him fast enough or get his juice exactly right.  I can <br/>\nsense his mood and try to make the situation light-hearted but it often <br/>\njust infuriates him.  He has become extremely rude to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hardest situation is when my dd doesn&#39;t want to play with him, <br/>\nespecially when she has a friend over.  I completely respect that and <br/>\ntry hard to let them be alone.  This will send ds into a very angry <br/>\ntantrum, banging on the door of the room they are trying to play and <br/>\nbeing extremely rude to me, telling me to &quot;leave me alone&quot; or &quot;I said <br/>\nstop talking to me&quot;, etc.  He just refuses to take no for an answer.  <br/>\nAnd honestly, I try to say &quot;no&quot; as little as possible, although to him, <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t see it that way ~ he only notices the times I do say no.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really at my wits end as it&#39;s really making a rift with my <br/>\ndaughters.  They just don&#39;t want to be around him and they are sick of <br/>\nhis almost constant whining, complaining, anger, hitting, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve really, really tried to be understanding and divert his attention <br/>\nwhen things start to escalate and it&#39;ll work for awhile but eventually, <br/>\nit ends up back to him crying.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I really hope someone has some advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks SO much.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bittybraille.com\">http://bittybraille.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://julieannhandmadegoods.com\">http://julieannhandmadegoods.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://julieann.etsy.com\">http://julieann.etsy.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://julieann-handmade-goods.blogspot.com\">http://julieann-handmade-goods.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://indiediner.blogspot.com\">http://indiediner.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://findingwonder.blogspot.com\">http://findingwonder.blogspot.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27484,"nextTopicId":27495}}
