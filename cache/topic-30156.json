He&#39;s nervous<br/>\nhe will &quot;be behind&quot; (because he&#39;s been to school) and I don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat to tell him.  &quot;How will I get into college with no grades?&quot;  &quot;Do<br/>\nI need to take the GED?&quot;  That kind of thing.  He&#39;s kind of a worrier<br/>\nby nature...well a quiet worrier, so this stuff bounces around in his<br/>\nbrain for a long time until he&#39;s finally overwrought and it comes out.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron had the same doubts. We&#39;d sent him to a private prep school, so <br/>\nnot only did he have those thoughts instilled by the school and his <br/>\nteachers and peers, but by ME too! He was 13 when we pulled him out, <br/>\nand it took YEARS for him to be able to see that this was a *good* <br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, he never actually wanted to go BACK to school, but he wasn&#39;t sure <br/>\nI was all-so-flippin&#39;-smart either. &lt;g&gt; Talking to his friends <br/>\n*continually* gave him reason to wonder whether this was a good idea or <br/>\nnot. &quot;Not&quot; generally won out.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe can look back now and agree it was a great idea---this unschooling <br/>\nstuff, but that doesn&#39;t change how he felt *then*.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do you recommend I say to Liam to help him relax?  I want him<br/>\nto know that he can be a Dr or whatever he decides he wants to do when<br/>\nhe gets older even if he hasn&#39;t been put through the public school<br/>\ncombine.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it&#39;s hard now. BTDT. Honestly, not much *you* can say will make <br/>\na difference---not for a while, anyway. I mean---it wasn&#39;t that long <br/>\nago that *you* made him go to school, right? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t remember where you are. Is it possible to get to a conference? <br/>\nMeeting other teens can help a LOT. Older teens/young adults especially.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust seeing the absolute JOY in them---and how remarkably comfortable <br/>\nthey are with each other, with their own selves, with adults, and with <br/>\ntheir environment---he can&#39;t help but be inspired (you too!).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if we move to DC he wants to go to a private Jewish school.  (It&#39;s<br/>\n13K a year YIKES!)  I&#39;ve told him we can go visit it (our moving there<br/>\nis very iffy really so we don&#39;t plan to far out) and see what he<br/>\nthinks.  I don&#39;t know what to say to him.  If he wants to go back to<br/>\nschool do I encourage him to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t *encourage* it. But I wouldn&#39;t deny it either. Make *home* a <br/>\nplace that offers as much---if not *more* than school ever could.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHe does seem to do better when<br/>\nhe&#39;s in school because he doesn&#39;t worry about this other stuff and I<br/>\ncan&#39;t help but think if I could do a better job of answering him he<br/>\ncould relax about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you ever seen/read The Shawshank Redemption? Stephen King?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the characters gets released. He can&#39;t handle it. Prison is all <br/>\nhe&#39;s ever known. It&#39;s a *safe* place for him because he&#39;s been told for <br/>\nthe majority of his life what, when, and how. He has too hard of a time <br/>\ndealing with freedom on the outside, so he hangs himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think school can *do* that to us as well. Freedom&#39;s HARD. It&#39;s a <br/>\n*job* to learn how to handle freedom and all it entails. Sometimes the <br/>\nfamiliarity of NO freedom is easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt DOES get better.

I can remember at the beginning of every school year planning to be good, to buckle down and work hard. I would have my three ring binder organised because organisation was the key to knowledge, right? Oh and I always failed by about the 3rd week in. And I floundered all year, knowing that I should be able to do this stuff, but I just couldn&#39;t. Knowing that I would never be any good at anything. Poor Liam. It must be scary to have those kinds of fears whirling around in your brain. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/teens\">http://sandradodd.com/teens</a> might comfort a bit. Although it might make him feel lacking. It is easy to compare yourself line for line with someone else and see how you don&#39;t measure up. In the end the best way to make him feel better might be to up the engagement in his life. Not that I am suggesting he doesn&#39;t have an engaging life, but sometimes those fears could be a product of not feeling active or<br/>\n involved enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n==========================<br/>\n<br/>\nMy <br/>\nson <br/>\nLiam <br/>\n(9) <br/>\nis <br/>\nhaving <br/>\na <br/>\nhard <br/>\ntime <br/>\nwith <br/>\nthis <br/>\nconcept.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s <br/>\nnervous<br/>\nhe <br/>\nwill <br/>\n&quot;be <br/>\nbehind&quot; <br/>\n(because <br/>\nhe&#39;s <br/>\nbeen <br/>\nto <br/>\nschool) <br/>\nand <br/>\nI <br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\nknow<br/>\nwhat <br/>\nto <br/>\ntell <br/>\nhim.  <br/>\n&quot;How <br/>\nwill <br/>\nI <br/>\nget <br/>\ninto <br/>\ncollege <br/>\nwith <br/>\nno <br/>\ngrades?&quot;  <br/>\n&quot;Do<br/>\nI <br/>\nneed <br/>\nto <br/>\ntake <br/>\nthe <br/>\nGED?&quot;  <br/>\nThat <br/>\nkind <br/>\nof <br/>\nthing.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s <br/>\nkind <br/>\nof <br/>\na <br/>\nworrier<br/>\nby <br/>\nnature...well <br/>\na <br/>\nquiet <br/>\nworrier, <br/>\nso <br/>\nthis <br/>\nstuff <br/>\nbounces <br/>\naround <br/>\nin <br/>\nhis<br/>\nbrain <br/>\nfor <br/>\na <br/>\nlong <br/>\ntime <br/>\nuntil <br/>\nhe&#39;s <br/>\nfinally <br/>\noverwrought <br/>\nand <br/>\nit <br/>\ncomes <br/>\nout.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd <br/>\nI <br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\nthink <br/>\nI&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen <br/>\nable <br/>\nto <br/>\ngive <br/>\nhim <br/>\nan <br/>\nanswer <br/>\nthat <br/>\nhelps <br/>\nhim<br/>\nrelax.  <br/>\nJohn <br/>\non <br/>\nthe <br/>\nother <br/>\nhand <br/>\n(11) <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t <br/>\nseem <br/>\nto <br/>\never <br/>\nworry <br/>\nabout<br/>\nit <br/>\nat <br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo <br/>\nwhat <br/>\ndo <br/>\nyou <br/>\nrecommend <br/>\nI <br/>\nsay <br/>\nto <br/>\nLiam <br/>\nto <br/>\nhelp <br/>\nhim <br/>\nrelax?

He&#39;s nervous<br/>\nhe will &quot;be behind&quot; (because he&#39;s been to school) and I don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat to tell him.  &quot;How will I get into college with no grades?&quot;  &quot;Do<br/>\nI need to take the GED?&quot;  That kind of thing.  He&#39;s kind of a worrier<br/>\nby nature...well a quiet worrier, so this stuff bounces around in his<br/>\nbrain for a long time until he&#39;s finally overwrought and it comes out.<br/>\n And I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been able to give him an answer that helps him<br/>\nrelax.  John on the other hand (11) doesn&#39;t seem to ever worry about<br/>\nit at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do you recommend I say to Liam to help him relax?  I want him<br/>\nto know that he can be a Dr or whatever he decides he wants to do when<br/>\nhe gets older even if he hasn&#39;t been put through the public school<br/>\ncombine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if we move to DC he wants to go to a private Jewish school.  (It&#39;s<br/>\n13K a year YIKES!)  I&#39;ve told him we can go visit it (our moving there<br/>\nis very iffy really so we don&#39;t plan to far out) and see what he<br/>\nthinks.  I don&#39;t know what to say to him.  If he wants to go back to<br/>\nschool do I encourage him to do that?  He does seem to do better when<br/>\nhe&#39;s in school because he doesn&#39;t worry about this other stuff and I<br/>\ncan&#39;t help but think if I could do a better job of answering him he<br/>\ncould relax about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29965,"nextTopicId":30169}}
