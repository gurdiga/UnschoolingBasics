I&#39;d wager none.  They probably can&#39;t spell despite the fact<br/>\nthat they went through the public school system.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDespite that, I think spelling is like penmanship.

I&#39;m saddened that your opinion of these <br/>\nradical unschoolers is so affected by one school subject. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf that same parent, that can&#39;t spell very well is also one of the <br/>\nmost gentle and kind parents, a parent that is highly involved with <br/>\ntheir children and showing them how to get information, a parent <br/>\nthat is wildly successful in whatever they choose to do in life, <br/>\nwould that change your opinion? Maybe school subjects aren&#39;t the end-<br/>\nall-be-all of a wonderful life, NOR a good indicator of who will <br/>\nmake a great unschooling parent. <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, there are many very dull minded people that can spell <br/>\nand write perfectly.
