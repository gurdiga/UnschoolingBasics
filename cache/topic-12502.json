Like the <br/>\ntime I cut my baby brother&#39;s hair (I was 5, he was 2) and was grounded <br/>\nfrom TV for a day. I forgot of course, being 5, and when I was caught <br/>\nwatching TV a few hours later, I was grounded for a WEEK.  Huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your husband can&#39;t bring himself to admit - to your SON - that his <br/>\npunishment was stupid (because I can guarantee you the boy knows how <br/>\nstupid it is) it may well damage their relationship.  Whereas, the <br/>\nfather admitting that it was an ill-considered thing, having nothing <br/>\nto do with the offense at hand, and to sit down without anger and talk <br/>\nabout appropriate courtesy to people in general...it may strengthen <br/>\ntheir relationship. And this is really about the two of them, not <br/>\nabout you (right at the moment).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has been known to make some knee-jerk overstrong <br/>\npunishments (and by the way, I have no problem arguing with him in <br/>\nfront of the kids, because I want THEM to see that I will stand up for <br/>\nthem in the face of something like that, as my mother never did), and <br/>\nI want them to see how &#39;fair&#39; fighting between adults is done. When, <br/>\nas happens sometimes, I convince my husband to back down.....he goes <br/>\nto the wronged child and says &quot;I was angry, and I am still angry about <br/>\nbehavior X, but I was too harsh with the punishment and I was wrong <br/>\ntoo. So we&#39;ll do this other thing instead.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes a really big man to get down at a child&#39;s level and say &quot;I <br/>\nwas wrong too.&quot;  It takes nothing of the sort to use a ham-handed fist <br/>\nof authority.

My husband and I<br/>\nhave completely different parenting styles, if you can call it that.  (It&#39;s<br/>\nmore like driving without a map and refusing to ask for directions!)  He can<br/>\nbe all fire and brimstone sometimes because he just thinks shock and awe is<br/>\nso effective but I must admit I resort to the &#39;no candy&#39; method a lot and my<br/>\nson sees if for what it is and shouts:  Don&#39;t threaten me!&quot;  My kids are<br/>\nafraid of their Dad when starts yelling.

(I could go on <br/>\nabout how that makes no sense but I think you all get it)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband said &quot;this unschooling this is just not working, see what <br/>\nhas happened because of it?&quot;<br/>\nI disagreed.<br/>\nI think that because our Son has the right place and the safe <br/>\nenvoroment its all starting to come out (like poping a zit) and thats <br/>\na good thing.<br/>\nMy husband said that yes that was a posibility but felt he couldn&#39;t go <br/>\nback on what he said about the candy.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhile we were not an Unschooling family we hardly had hard & <br/>\nfast &quot;rules&quot; and were way less strict than other parents I know we <br/>\nwould ocasionaly need to limit things or remove things from our sons <br/>\nlife for a while.<br/>\n No more staying up late when he began having &quot;tired&quot; meltdowns at <br/>\nschool is one example, there always seemed to be a logical reasoning <br/>\nfor most things we limited/changed ect. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had stopped doing that because in reality there wasnt any need to <br/>\ncontinue with him being at home. -IMO- or at least thats what I <br/>\nthought untill Mr. No candy flipped his lid.  (I think that is all My <br/>\nhusband knows to do and he reached for that in a moment of frustration-<br/>\n -yes, I know he needs better tools-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHormonaly I think our son is entering a phase in his life that is very <br/>\nconfusing and frightening for him and for us as well but especialy his <br/>\nfather. (my husband didnt have a father and has no clue how to be one) <br/>\nI can see them begining to butt heads for &quot;controle&quot; sometimes (like <br/>\nmy husband and son both want to sit next to me on the sofa and both <br/>\npout when they can&#39;t) and I believe that our son is working out some <br/>\ntoxic Stuff in a safe place- which should be a good thing, but it <br/>\nhurts and its messy and frightening.<br/>\n<br/>\n I disagree with Mr. No candy on how this situation was handeled, <br/>\nhowever I also do not want to argue with him (but I do think he is <br/>\nwrong) I have made my points and shared my reasonings for our sons <br/>\nbehaviour recently and while my husband doesn&#39;t disagree he is still <br/>\nhaving a hard time believing unschooling can work. he is nervious and <br/>\nready to point out how it isnt working even though I do not think the <br/>\ntwo things (unschooling and unkindness) were related, and even though <br/>\nhe agreed (in retrospect) that perhaps they were not (but &quot;might be&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have however spoken at length with our son who agrees he is <br/>\nstrugeling and doesn&#39;t know what has been happening lately emotionaly <br/>\nfor him and we talked about moving away from restrictive things into <br/>\ntrust and we also discused the &quot;protective urge&quot; males have when they <br/>\nsee a female they love hurting from what someone else has said or done <br/>\namong a dozen other things relating to this incident.<br/>\n <br/>\n The best I can hope for is to be able to comunicate to my husband how <br/>\ninested of jumping for things we no longer need that he should be <br/>\nthinking in new ways. <br/>\n<br/>\n There is a welth of information out there which overwhelms him I have <br/>\nfound a few things for him to read but If anyone has anything that <br/>\nspecificly talks about this type of thing I&#39;d love to be able to let <br/>\nmy husband know that other men have been able to find positive ways to <br/>\nget through this time with their sons and not against them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIm tired, very tired, I hope this made sense.<br/>\nthank you for your support.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12610,"nextTopicId":12535}}
