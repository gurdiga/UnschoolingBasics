I like what Diana said at LIG, that it&#39;s an entirely different ball game for kids who are doing drugs to &quot;fill a hole&quot; than for kids who are experimenting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our home we TALK A LOT!!!  And Kev researches the hell out of things so he knows an incredible amount about each and every drug.  There are certain drugs that he won&#39;t touch, no matter what!  He has experimented with pot and mushrooms at this point and really wants to do LSD.  We&#39;ve talked with several people who have experimented with it as well and he is very informed on the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s already been mentioned but you aren&#39;t going to stop a child who really wants to do those things, what you can do is make it as safe as possible and I&#39;m really glad that we have the kind of relationship that he can come to me and talk to me about it.  And he isn&#39;t a &quot;druggie&quot;- he is an extremely responsible, well-grounded individual.  Diana reminded me that the man who created LSD lived to be 103 and did LOTS of it so...........  <br/>\n<br/>\nNot that I&#39;m an advocate for drugs, lol, but not all drugs are the scary, &quot;oh my god, he is going to be a loser the rest of his life&quot; thing that society makes them out to be.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41464,"nextTopicId":41488}}
