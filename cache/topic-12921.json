Keon still will hit<br/>\nwhen he gets *very* angry.  Why do children hit, especially in the younger<br/>\nyears?  Because hitting is a physical reaction to express an unspeakable<br/>\nemotion.  When a child is young or has difficulty expressing themselves when<br/>\nthey are emotionall upset, physical actions tend to take place of the words<br/>\nthat they can&#39;t say.  Some children will melt into a puddle.  Some children<br/>\nwill run away from the situation.  Some children will run to mommy to nurse<br/>\nor be soothed.  And some people will act in a way that is seemingly<br/>\ninappropriate.  Helping to give them words is a good way to help them<br/>\neliminate the physical action.  Give them the words when they are angry and<br/>\ngive them the words when they are not angry.  Talk about it.  Role play it<br/>\neven.  Eventually your child will learn these things on her own but it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t hurt to help her along.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I have noticed is that adults do their own form of &quot;hitting&quot;<br/>\nwhen they are angry.  It&#39;s called cussing.  Why do people cuss?  Because it<br/>\nshows a strong emotion like hitting does.  Running off a string of<br/>\nexplicatives is like punching the air with anger.  We have learned to<br/>\ncontrol the physical part of hitting, but the emotional part is still there,<br/>\njust replaced by words.  I would love to see a study if children who were<br/>\nhitters grew up to be adults who cuss.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way to help eliminate the hitting is to consider when and where she<br/>\nmost hits.  Does she hit mostly at playgroup?  Does she truly enjoy<br/>\nplaygroup? When it is playgroup day is she excited, eager, and ready or do<br/>\nyou take her just because it is something to do?  If you miss playgroup does<br/>\nshe express a loss or go about what she is doing?  Perhaps waiting a while<br/>\non the playgroup front is what is needed.  Or maybe she needs to work with<br/>\nsmaller groups.  Have one friend over or at the most 2.  If she says she<br/>\nlikes playgroup, find out what it is about playgroup that she enjoys.  It<br/>\nmay be that she enjoys the park that you go to or playing with a particular<br/>\ntoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":236384541,"authorName":"clinstrom5","from":"&quot;clinstrom5&quot; &lt;clinstrom5@...&gt;","profile":"clinstrom5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Help- dd is a hitter","postDate":"1147229610","msgId":12932,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUzcmtqYStydG0xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGUzcmptcCtxMmJwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":12931,"nextInTopic":12935,"prevInTime":12931,"nextInTime":12933,"topicId":12921,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Amelie-  Of course it would not work for all children.

I say &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; <br/>\nto the parents and the kid if necessary and offer help. Sometimes my <br/>\nkids do, sometimes not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKiersten<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nBut why not time outs?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s actually a good question when the AAP has advocated for Time <br/>\nOuts as a preferred alternative to corporal punishment.  In truth, <br/>\nif the choice is between a spanking and a time out, I&#39;d suggest the <br/>\ntime out.  But that&#39;s not the only choice!  And both are rooted in a <br/>\npunitive mindset.  A punishment is something that is added on to <br/>\nteaching to cause the child to feel bad with the underlying belief <br/>\nthat only by feeling bad can they learn.  But, in fact, they learn <br/>\nlots of things without feeling bad.  They learn to walk and talk and <br/>\nspell their own name without requiring punishment, so the argument <br/>\nthat they can&#39;t learn if they don&#39;t feel bad is completely <br/>\nunfounded.  In fact, a basic belief in GBD and PD is that people who <br/>\nfeel good act good while people who feel bad act bad.  So when a <br/>\nchild is acting bad it is illogical to think that making them feel <br/>\nworse will somehow get them to act better.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I&#39;m speaking of classic time outs here.  Or, thanks to <br/>\nSupernanny, what is sometimes referred to as a naughty place.  The <br/>\nway this works is that a child is separated from the family and <br/>\nignored for a time that is equal to 1 minute per age of the child.  <br/>\nThe child is told that they are bad/naughty/misbehaving/etc and the <br/>\nparent will get them when the time is up.  They are instructed <br/>\nto &quot;think about&quot; what they have done wrong.  Supernanny insists on <br/>\nan apology at the end .<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several punitive aspects to this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile Supernanny allows for young children to be viewable by the <br/>\nfamily, traditional time outs, and her Naughty Room for older <br/>\nchildren, require that the child be isolated away from the family <br/>\nduring the time out.  This gives the clear message to a child that <br/>\nacceptance in the family is conditional upon their behavior.  If it <br/>\nis not acceptable they are rejected; if it is acceptable, they are <br/>\naccepted.  For many children this translates into a message of <br/>\nconditional love.  Also, while introverted children may respond okay <br/>\nto forced isolation, for many extroverted children this is traumatic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one-minute-per year is an arbitrary time.  There is no guarantee <br/>\nthat a child will be calmed down in that time, and other children <br/>\nwill calm down long before that time is over.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen an apology is required to leave the time out or naughty place <br/>\nthis is a forced apology and not a true indicator of a child&#39;s <br/>\nremorse.  They are taught that an apology is a negotiating tool and <br/>\nnot taught empathy or remorse.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the place of classic time outs there are many GBD tools that <br/>\nprovide actual teaching and do not have the punitive aspects.  GBD <br/>\nis an entire paradigm shift.  Children are not viewed as &quot;naughty&quot;.  <br/>\nParents and children aren&#39;t in battles that must be won.  Since <br/>\npeople who feel good act good, one goal of GBD is to help people <br/>\nfeel good.  Now, happy isn&#39;t the only acceptable emotion, and <br/>\nthere&#39;s lots of opportunity to use tools like reflecting feelings.  <br/>\nThe way that people learn how to feel good is to be equipped with <br/>\ntools that they can use to exercise self control in difficult <br/>\nsituations.  Taking a break, or what is sometimes referred to as <br/>\na &quot;Positive time out&quot; is one way to do that.  As a means for <br/>\nproviding this, I recommend a Comfort Corner.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Comfort Corner is a space in the common area of a home that is set <br/>\nup to be a retreat for a child (or an adult).  It&#39;s a place they can <br/>\ngo to step out of a situation, take a break, regroup.  There are <br/>\nthings there that provide them with comfort--stuffed animals, <br/>\npillows, blankets, music, books, whatever will bless your child.  <br/>\nLet them help design it if you want.  It can be as simple as a chair <br/>\nwith a blanket, or as complex as a room under the stairs full of <br/>\noptions.  some will argue that this is rewarding poor behavior, but <br/>\nif you aren&#39;t actively high fiving and saying &quot;awesome&quot; about their <br/>\npoor behavior then you aren&#39;t rewarding or encouraging it.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever thanked my child for yelling or said that if they did I&#39;d give <br/>\nthem ice cream   One illustration I like to use, to make it relevant <br/>\nfor adults, is if I come over and you&#39;ve been having a bad day and <br/>\nnot behaving well (maybe grousing or yelling at the kids, not doing <br/>\nyour responsibilities around the house, etc) which would you prefer <br/>\nme to do:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  &quot;I&#39;m disgusted at the way you&#39;ve been behaving today. Your <br/>\nchildren deserve better than this.  What kind of a mother do you <br/>\nthink you are?  You need to go into your room for 30 minutes (1 <br/>\nminute per year  ) and really think about how bad you are.  I will <br/>\ncome and get you in 1/2 hour and then I will be nice to you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nor<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  &quot;Wow, you&#39;re having a bad day.  How about I watch the kids for a <br/>\nbit and you go get a cup of coffee and take a break    Come back <br/>\nwhen you&#39;re feeling better and if you want to talk about what&#39;s <br/>\ngoing on we can do it then.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a child is sent to the Comfort Corner the only rule is that you <br/>\ndon&#39;t talk about why they were sent when they are there, and they <br/>\nmay come out when they are ready to rejoin the family and be <br/>\ncooperative.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor older children there may be a need for a tool called &quot;you hit, <br/>\nyou sit&quot;.  When children get aggressive and violent it&#39;s appropriate <br/>\nto stop their bodies and give them a chance to get their brain back <br/>\nin control.  If you have a Comfort Corner they can be sent there, or <br/>\neven just sitting on the couch until they are ready to be calm in <br/>\ntheir play and make amends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do teach children how to apologize, including the words ,&quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nsorry&quot;, but more importantly the words, &quot;Will you forgive me?&quot;  And <br/>\nI teach all of my children how to forgive--because forgiveness is <br/>\nabout casting off the burden of unforgiveness and going on with your <br/>\nlife at peace with others.  When you wrong someone you owe them a <br/>\ndebt. Making amends is about taking responsibility and doing what <br/>\nyou can to pay that debt.  We can never undo our actions, but making <br/>\nan effort to repay the debt we owe someone teaches personal <br/>\nresponsibility for our actions, and is much more important than the <br/>\nability to say empty &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;s.  Saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; might be part <br/>\nof making amends.  There may also be a need to offer a gentle touch <br/>\nto make amends for a violent one, to return a toy and offer an <br/>\nadditional one where a toy was taken, to do a kind act where <br/>\nunkindness was done.  I have the offending child ask the offended <br/>\nchild what kind thing they can do to help them feel better.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly, GBD is about working to proactively prevent the situations <br/>\nthat would result in time outs.  By knowing our children well enough <br/>\nto structure situations to set them up for success.  Using the 5 <br/>\nSteps makes instructions non-optional and has built in &quot;help&quot; if the <br/>\nchild is not able to accomplish something themselves.  Ultimately, <br/>\nrather than an adversarial relationship, GBD equips parents to be <br/>\nthe coaches on the family team.  There may be a time during a <br/>\nsporting event where someone is pulled off the field to take a <br/>\nPositive Time Out, or have a break, regain their cool and get ready <br/>\nto go back on the field.  Something is very broken on the team when <br/>\nsomeone is thrown from the game in a negative time out.  When you <br/>\nview your family as a team it&#39;s much easier to see that when one <br/>\nperson fails, we all fail, but when one person succeeds, we all <br/>\nsucceed.  Success for all is the goal.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":236384541,"authorName":"clinstrom5","from":"&quot;clinstrom5&quot; &lt;clinstrom5@...&gt;","profile":"clinstrom5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Help- dd is a hitter","postDate":"1147216560","msgId":12930,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUzcjdyZys1OGM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGUzcXZxbCtkbGU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":12928,"nextInTopic":12931,"prevInTime":12929,"nextInTime":12931,"topicId":12921,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Misty-  AS the mom of a child who often on the receiving end of hitting by a friend I commend you for recognizing it and trying to do something about it.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-782639915\">Hi Misty-  AS the mom of a child who often on the receiving end of <br/>\nhitting by a friend I commend you for recognizing it and trying to do <br/>\nsomething about it.

When my toddlers were violent for whatever reason to <br/>\nanother child I always comforted and paid A LOT of attention to that <br/>\nother child very obviously in front of my toddler.

It is<br/>\nwritten with the idea that we can&#39;t teach that which we do not know.<br/>\nIt is called &quot;Easy to Love, Difficult to Discipline&quot; by Becky Bailey.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t agree with everything she has to say, but the skills and<br/>\nchange in mindset are top notch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-</a><br/>\n/0060007753/qid=1123189948/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-9559032-5273555?<br/>\nv=glance&s=books&n=507846<br/>\n<br/>\nKiersten<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------<br/>\nI was going to suggest the Becky Bailey book Easy to Love, Difficult <br/>\nto<br/>\nDiscipline as well. One idea from her that we have really integrated <br/>\nis<br/>\nthat of attributing a positive intention to a child&#39;s behavior even <br/>\nif<br/>\nthe behavior is problematic, and expressing that to the child. So, <br/>\nfor<br/>\ninstance, if my older son grabs a toy away from my toddler, saying,<br/>\n&quot;You wanted to make sure you got to play with that toy as much as you<br/>\nwanted to,&quot; or if he grabs a cookie off somebody else&#39;s plate, &quot;wow,<br/>\nyou are really enjoying those cookies!&quot; You can go on from there with<br/>\nwhatever &quot;discipline&quot; or problem-solving approach feels right to<br/>\nyou--we usually focus on alternative strategies for getting that need<br/>\nmet--but taking the attitude that there is some positive and<br/>\nappropriate motivation behind the behavior is good for the parent and<br/>\nthe child as well. (Think about what a different message that sends<br/>\nthan an implicit or explicit characterization of the child <br/>\nas &quot;greedy&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;grabby&quot; or &quot;selfish.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also like Bailey&#39;s assertion, as Kiersten mentioned, that you <br/>\ncan&#39;t<br/>\nteach what you don&#39;t know--another way to think about it is that you<br/>\ncan&#39;t expect a child to rise to standards of behavior you don&#39;t meet<br/>\nfor yourself. Bailey would say, you have to discipline yourself <br/>\nfirst.<br/>\nThis has helped my partner and me in looking at our own behaviors, <br/>\nand<br/>\nin developing expectations of behaviors and treatments that really<br/>\napply to the whole family, not with one (higher) standard for kids <br/>\nand<br/>\nanother one for adults.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------<br/>\nI agree that a great deal of the material (as well as the title) is<br/>\nnot ideal for unschooling. The title, in fact, doesn&#39;t seem to fit<br/>\nthe book at all and probably hurts her sales.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs background- I found the book being discussed on<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gentlechristianmothers.com/\">http://www.gentlechristianmothers.com/</a> when looking for advice for a<br/>\nDobson follower. She was only willing to read Christian authors. I<br/>\nwas not looking to &quot;discipline&quot; my kids. I was, however, intrigued<br/>\nby the discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I should list more specifics about why I DID like the book.<br/>\nSome of these ideas may sound obvious to you, but it came as a shock<br/>\nto me to hear things spelled out so simply. The family environment I<br/>\nwas raised in did nothing to help me learn these skills...<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the 7 &quot;attitude shifts&quot; she discusses and what I thought<br/>\nabout them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude shift 1: Harnessing the Power of Perception  (no one can<br/>\nmake you angry without your permission)<br/>\nReason: to own your own upset<br/>\n<br/>\nNotice how your thoughts create your feelings. when you feel angry,<br/>\noverwhelmed or anxious, check to see what you are thinking, where is<br/>\nyour mind directed?<br/>\nHow often do you use blaming language (You are making me so _____)?<br/>\nWhen you blame others, you are giving up your control (of yourself).<br/>\n<br/>\nI caught myself using blaming language more often than I expected<br/>\nand have been working hard to own my feelings and accept them.<br/>\nStrangely, I could accept my kids having big feelings, but was<br/>\npunishing myself whenever I got overwhelmed by similar emotions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude Shift 2: Harnessing the Power of Attention<br/>\nReason: what you focus on you get more of<br/>\n<br/>\nPay Attention to your focus. Are you focusing on what you want or on<br/>\nwhat you dont want?&quot; When you are upset, it is almost always because<br/>\nyou are focusing on what you DO NOT want!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am constantly trying to frame things in terms of what I DO want<br/>\nnow. I hadn&#39;t realized how often I said &quot;I can&#39;t&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t know<br/>\nhow&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t want this&quot;, etc. I was priming myself to feel BAD. It<br/>\nis hard for me sometimes to even come up with a positive statement<br/>\nwhen I am getting overwhelmed. I am working so hard to pay attention<br/>\nand make this change. It does work. Changing what I focus on is<br/>\nchanging my attitude and my actions. I feel like I can set a more<br/>\npositive example for my kids now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude Shift 3: Harnessing the Power of Free Will<br/>\nReason: The only person you can make change is yourself<br/>\n<br/>\nChange your &quot;shoulds&quot; to &quot;coulds&quot;; Then make a choice and live with<br/>\nit. Instead of saying I &quot;should&quot; go to the store or I &quot;should&quot; write<br/>\nthose thank-you cards, say I &quot;could&quot; do _______, and then choose. It<br/>\nis free will. YOU have the right to choose what to do.<br/>\nAllow others to have their own thoughts and feelings. Pay attention<br/>\nto what you feel when people disagree with you. (Most of us feel<br/>\nthreatened).<br/>\n<br/>\nI lived in a world of &quot;shoulds&quot;- guilt self-imposed that I put at<br/>\nthe feet of my mother or grandmother. I willingly felt bad for not<br/>\ndoing what &quot;they&quot; wanted. I feel so much more powerful and in<br/>\ncontrol since I have been owning my actions. Many times I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\ncomplete a task because it became this huge albatross of obligation<br/>\nand sucked away any of my desire to do it. I have felt more<br/>\nindependent and strong since I have been choosing my actions instead<br/>\nof trying to make other people happy at my own expense.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude Shift 4: Harnessing the Power of unity<br/>\nReason: to focus on connecting instead of trying to be special<br/>\n<br/>\nTake five minutes or more, daily and &quot;just be&quot; with each of your<br/>\nchildren. Put aside any agenda, and simply enjoy their company.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis one wasn&#39;t too powerful for me, but I am with them almost 24/7,<br/>\nso 5 minutes sounds ridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude Shift 5: Harnessing the Power of Love<br/>\nReason: to see the best in one another<br/>\n<br/>\nWish People Well. Do this silently from your heart when you are<br/>\nstanding in lines, driving, or passing people as you walk. Give this<br/>\ngift to everyone you see. Notice how you feel when you do this.<br/>\nBegin each day being grateful for at least three things. Before you<br/>\ngo to bed, tell all your family members how thankful you are for<br/>\ntheir presence in your life. Notice what this does for your energy<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where the idea of attributing the best possible intentions<br/>\nto a child was covered. I think I do pretty well with this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude Shift 6: Harnessing the power of Acceptance<br/>\nReason: this moment is as it is<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was a big one. She talked about not making blanket statements<br/>\nlike &quot;we don&#39;t hit in this house&quot; after someone has just hit. You<br/>\ndeny the present by making such statements. Accept what is, AS IT IS!<br/>\nMake choices based on what IS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often fall back on how things &quot;should&quot; be. I was raised in a very<br/>\npunishment/reward centered home and learned that if I did A, then<br/>\nB &quot;should&quot; happen. I have found myself dissapointed a great deal<br/>\nwhen what I expected and wanted didn&#39;t happen. I am working on<br/>\naccepting things as they are.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Practice being peaceful in the moment by noticing things and<br/>\ndescribing what you see, without judgements. Notice the weather,<br/>\nplants outdoors, shadows, smells and sounds.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Add a ritual to your childs bedtime routine that involves saying<br/>\ngoodnight to her body parts. for example, Im going to say goodnight<br/>\nto your ears (touch the ears) your chin, elbows.....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has helped me be more present and focus on just enjoying my<br/>\nkids and making up our own special time at night instead of focusing<br/>\non trying to get them to sleep as fast as possible. As a side<br/>\nbenefit, we are all happier and they do fall asleep more easily. (I<br/>\nam sure they felt my fatigue and desire for them to sleep before and<br/>\nI was probably noticibly &quot;going through the motions&quot; My kids are 2<br/>\nand 3 1/2, so I do help them wind down at night (when they are ready)<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude Shift 7: Harnessing the Power of Attention<br/>\nReason: Conflict offers an opportunity to teach<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever conflict arises, breathe deeply and remind<br/>\nyourself &quot;conflict is an opportunity to teach and learn&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus on Responding to conflict rather than trying to eliminate it.<br/>\nTHIS is probably the most important thing I could have read!<br/>\nMy kids are only 18 months apart and we have conflicts fairly<br/>\nregularly. I was raised in a family where my main objective was to<br/>\navoid conflict at all cost. It is a scary place for me to be<br/>\nemotionally and I was trying to get my kids to &quot;just get along&quot; and<br/>\nnot seeing the benefit to all of us in their inherent struggles.<br/>\nNow I am working on handling my emotions and helping them find ways<br/>\nto get what they want. They seem to be better at it than me :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this was a super long post, but I though maybe more info.<br/>\nwould help show WHAT, in particular, I liked about the book. I am<br/>\nstill early in this unschooling journey and most of my time is spent<br/>\nbecoming a better person for myself and hopfully making some of<br/>\nthese ideas second nature for my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf these ideas are all obvious to you, be GLAD!<br/>\nI have been changing a great deal since reading this book because it<br/>\njust wasn&#39;t obvious to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nKiersten</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96545052,"authorName":"marji","from":"marji &lt;marji@...&gt;","profile":"gaia10921","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Help- dd is a hitter","postDate":"1147212975","msgId":12926,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcuMC4xLjAuMC4yMDA2MDUwOTE3NTU1MS4wMWM4Y2FiMEBnYWlhd29sZi5vcmc+","inReplyToHeader":"PGUzcXZxbCtkbGU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGUzcXZxbCtkbGU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":12925,"nextInTopic":12927,"prevInTime":12925,"nextInTime":12927,"topicId":12921,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think it would probably be very helpful for you to be very involved or at least be very close by whenever she is with other kids.

Really, everything is about <br/>\ncommunication!  She&#39;s trying to tell you something, and she either <br/>\nhasn&#39;t found words for it, or she has found that this aggressive <br/>\nbehavior has served her better than being verbal has (it gets your <br/>\nattention or whatever other payoff she&#39;s seeking**).

Sheer malice is <br/>\nrarely  (if ever) a kid&#39;s M.O.  When kids don&#39;t feel right, they <br/>\ndon&#39;t behave right.  Something is not sitting well with her, and your <br/>\njob is to find out what it is and help her.

I&#39;ve been dealing with <br/>\nthe issue of hitting with her for over a year now, and I can&#39;t seem <br/>\nto get her to stop.

Though <br/>\nI know they say children don&#39;t do things to be manipulative, she <br/>\ndefinitely seems to do it malisciously.  I&#39;ve even had friends tell <br/>\nme how &quot;unique&quot; my dd&#39;s behavor is as they&#39;ve seen more and more <br/>\ninteraction among toddlers/preschoolers.  They say they&#39;ve never <br/>\nseen anyone her age be so vindictive.  I&#39;ve tried just about <br/>\neverything I can think of and can&#39;t get her to stop.  This will <br/>\nprobably be a long post, b/c I want to give you as much information <br/>\non our situation as possible, and maybe somewhat disjointed.  Sorry, <br/>\nhope you can follow my thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\n***First of all let me give you some examples of her &quot;aggressive <br/>\nbehaviour&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday at a LLL meeting she found a stick and started poking the <br/>\ntwo boys she&#39;d been playing with, ages 3 & 4.  I didn&#39;t know she was <br/>\ndoing this until she&#39;d done it a couple of times.  At one point she <br/>\npoked one little boy in the ear and hurt him.  The family is one we <br/>\nknow and have been around several times, so the mother reprimanded <br/>\ndd without hesitation.  My daughter didn&#39;t seemed phased.  After a <br/>\nfew minutes the mother and child left for the bathroom or something <br/>\nas they were leaving the son went up to dd and said &quot;don&#39;t poke me <br/>\nwith the stick Rachel&quot; and then left.  Rachel immediately turned to <br/>\nthe other boy she&#39;d poked earlier, the 4yo, and tried to hit him.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night she had a nighttime snack before she went to bed, she <br/>\nchose honey dew.  We took her into the bathroom to clean her up, <br/>\nlike always.  When it came time to brush her teeth my husband picked <br/>\nher up, she&#39;s lost interest in doing it herself and declined it <br/>\nagain, and she slapped him across the face.  We put her in time <br/>\nout.  Afterwards we went back to the bathroom only to have the <br/>\nscenario repeat.  Time outs are about the only thing I&#39;ve read to do <br/>\nin situations of aggressive behaviour.  I will get more into that <br/>\nlater.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning she asked for her best friend to come over and play, <br/>\nhe&#39;d been gone for a week and we haven&#39;t seen him.  Once he came <br/>\nover they played for about 10-15 minutes before she started becoming <br/>\naggressive... pulling on him, pushing him, kicking.  Finally we had <br/>\nto attend the playdate after less than half an hour b/c Rachel <br/>\nslapped him across the face (her preferred thing to do) when he sat <br/>\nin a chair that she apparently didn&#39;t want him sitting in, even <br/>\nthough she never seems to use it herself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn another instance she was nursing and started twirling my hair I <br/>\ntold her she was pulling it and it was hurting me to please stop.  <br/>\nShe took hold of my hair and yanked as hard as she could.  This has <br/>\nhappened more than once.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my husband plays with her if he lays down or does something she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want her to do she throws things at him.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Reasons I think why this may be happening.<br/>\nLet me say first that I do not believe this is a communication <br/>\nthing.  DD is very bright for her age her language is about a year <br/>\nahead of her age.  She has never had problems being able to <br/>\ncommunicate, adn has never had temper tantrums like those I&#39;ve seen <br/>\nor heard of kids doing out of frustration from not being able to <br/>\ncommunicate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis behaviour seems to be on a roller coaster trend.  She may go <br/>\nweeks without any serious problems, except with dad, then have a <br/>\ncouple of weeks with nothing but problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one time I suspected that she was doing it when she was feeling <br/>\nabandonment.  Dad&#39;s been gone to work so she let&#39;s him know her <br/>\ndisproval by hitting and throwing things at him.  She hasn&#39;t seen <br/>\nher friends so she aggressive toward them when she does.  But, that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t seem to follow the pattern, except maybe with dh.  When it <br/>\ncomes to kids, she often picks on whom she deems the &quot;weakest&quot;.  <br/>\nMaybe the youngest in the group, the one with the least verbal <br/>\nskilss, the one with the least agility, the clingy one, etc.  Again <br/>\nI find it interesting that I don&#39;t seem to see her pick on girls as <br/>\nmuch, but as I said mainly plays with boys.  Most of the girls in <br/>\nour group have WAHMs so most of the playdates she is the only girl.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed she doesn&#39;t seem to have problems in our unschooling <br/>\ngroup were the kids are all older than her, also contains more <br/>\ngirls.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLike most children the lows on the roller coaster especially occur <br/>\nduring times when she&#39;s tired or hungry.  This week has been <br/>\nespecially bad, and dh thinks maybe she&#39;s not feeling well.  He&#39;s <br/>\nhad really bad allergies this week, and he thinks maybe she has as <br/>\nwell.  She&#39;s rarely sick, I think only twice in 2 1/2 yrs so she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have a lot of experience in communicating when her body <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t feel well.  I&#39;ve noticed this week as well that she&#39;s been <br/>\nmuch more, disobedient for lack of a better word.  She&#39;s dumping out <br/>\nthings onto the floor and doing other things she hasn&#39;t done in <br/>\nseveral months and knows is wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Books I&#39;ve read...<br/>\nSince this trend began at about 14 mo or so I&#39;ve read any book I <br/>\ncould about discipline.  I&#39;ve read<br/>\n-Dr. Sears discipline book<br/>\n- LLL Without Spanking or Spoiling<br/>\n-Harvey Karp&#39;s Happies Toddler (not helpful I found)<br/>\n-Love and Logic for Preschooler<br/>\n-Don&#39;t shoot the dog (a book our local API leader gave me about <br/>\nbehavor training.)<br/>\n-(I&#39;ve even read the What to Expect book) As well as a non-approved <br/>\nLLL about 2 and 3 yo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t read Alfie Kohn, I just recently heard about him, and <br/>\nhave &quot;unconditionaly love&quot; on reserve at the library wants it is <br/>\nreturned.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like the primary example as a problem in most of these <br/>\nbooks is cleaning up toys.  I could give a rats ass about that, I <br/>\njust want my dd to stop hitting!<br/>\n<br/>\n***Methods we&#39;ve tried..<br/>\nAs I think I mentioned earlier it seems that most of the books talk <br/>\nabout Time outs, which we&#39;re finding not to be very effective, and <br/>\nI&#39;m beginning to feel they&#39;re too punitive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve tried giving her words or alternative things she could do in <br/>\ndifferent situations. Expressing herself using words, walking away, <br/>\nplaying something else, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve said things like, hitting isn&#39;t how we touch someone, this is <br/>\nhow, and took her hand showed her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe leave her have friends leave when she begins to get aggressive.  <br/>\nSaying we can&#39;t stay if we&#39;re hurting others.  This doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>\nbe effective.  She doesn&#39;t really seem to care about having <br/>\nfriends.  She asks occassionally for her best friend but other than <br/>\nthat she could care less.  (My DH is kind of the same way)<br/>\nIt alludes me what else we&#39;ve tried, but if I think of it I&#39;ll add <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mentioned this problem several months back at a LLL toddler <br/>\nmeeting and every suggestion was something we&#39;d tried.  The final <br/>\nconclusion was that she just need to grow out of it.  But I can&#39;t <br/>\nwait for her to grow out of it any longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of the cause this behavior needs to stop.  She needs to <br/>\nlearn that even if she&#39;s tired or hungry, hitting and other <br/>\naggressive acts are never ok.  Help please.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesperate,<br/>\nMisty</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12942,"nextTopicId":12947}}
