Take  <br/>\na look at this, from the CA Education Code:<br/>\n<br/>\n51220.5. (a) The Legislature finds and declares the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) The family is our most fundamental social institution and the  <br/>\nmeans by which we care for, prepare, and train our children to be  <br/>\nproductive members of society.<br/>\n<br/>\n(2) Social research shows increasingly that the disintegration of the  <br/>\nfamily is a major cause of increased welfare enrollment, child abuse  <br/>\nand neglect, juvenile delinquency, and criminal activity.<br/>\n<br/>\n(3) The lack of knowledge of parenting skills and the lack of  <br/>\nadequate preparation to assume parental responsibilities are not only  <br/>\nmajor causes of family disintegration, but also contribute  <br/>\nsubstantially to the disastrous consequences of teen pregnancy.<br/>\n<br/>\n(4) Because the state government bears much of the economic and  <br/>\nsocial burden associated with the disintegration of the family in  <br/>\nCalifornia, the state has a legitimate and vital interest in  <br/>\nadequately preparing its residents for parenthood.<br/>\n<br/>\n(b) The Legislature recognizes that the public education system is  <br/>\nthe most efficient and effective means to educate the populace on a  <br/>\nlarge-scale basis, and intends, therefore, to use the public  <br/>\neducation system to ensure that each California resident has an  <br/>\nopportunity to acquire knowledge of parenting skills prior to  <br/>\nbecoming a parent. That knowledge should include, at a bare minimum,  <br/>\nall of the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nChild development and growth.<br/>\nEffective parenting.<br/>\nPrevention of child abuse.<br/>\nNutrition.<br/>\nHousehold finances and budgeting.<br/>\nPersonal and family interaction and relations.<br/>\nMethods to promote self-esteem.<br/>\nEffective decision making skills.<br/>\nFamily and individual health.<br/>\n(c) Commencing with the 1995-96 fiscal year, the adopted course of  <br/>\nstudy for grade 7 or 8 shall include the equivalent content of a one- <br/>\nsemester course in parenting skills and education. All pupils  <br/>\nentering grade 7 on or after July 1, 1995, shall be offered that  <br/>\ncourse or its equivalent content during grade 7 or 8, or both. On or  <br/>\nbefore January 1, 1995, the State Department of Education shall  <br/>\nsupply, to each school district that includes a grade 7 or 8, a  <br/>\nsample curriculum suitable either for implementation as a stand-alone  <br/>\none-semester course or for incorporation within identified existing  <br/>\nrequired or optional courses, with content designed to develop a  <br/>\nknowledge of topics including, but not limited to, all of the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nChild growth and development.<br/>\nParental responsibilities.<br/>\nHousehold budgeting.<br/>\nChild abuse and neglect issues.<br/>\nPersonal hygiene.<br/>\nMaintaining healthy relationships.<br/>\nTeen parenting issues.<br/>\nSelf-esteem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201330991,"authorName":"Queana","from":"&quot;Queana&quot; &lt;queana7@...&gt;","profile":"queanabruedal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] unschooling vs. parenting","postDate":"1151890786","msgId":15264,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGU4OXIxayttajk0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15261,"nextInTopic":15270,"prevInTime":15263,"nextInTime":15265,"topicId":15261,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For the first time, that made sense lol.
