So, she is not doing the homeschooling &gt;of her daughter because<br/>\nshe is a full time double doc student<br/>\nAgain, whether you can home educate a child who you are not parent/legal<br/>\nguardian of  varies from state to state. I haven&#39;t seen any indication<br/>\nwhere you are but since you are already home educating your kids, you<br/>\nprobably already know where to go and check out the laws. For example,<br/>\nin Delaware, there are separate options for establishing a &quot;single<br/>\nfamily homeschool&quot; which is parents/guardians and their own kids and a<br/>\n&quot;multi-family homeschool&quot; which is when the children being educated are<br/>\nnot related as siblings (which would fit in your circumstance). In VT,<br/>\nthe &quot;home study program&quot; is offered to not more than 2 non-family<br/>\nmembers or the children of one other family. So, in that case, you<br/>\n-could- home educate your granddaughter because she is 1 non-family<br/>\nmember/child of one other family besides your immediate offspring. And<br/>\nsome states, like CT, have no regulation one way or the other as to how<br/>\nyou educate your children (parents are to educate their children per CGS<br/>\n10-184, but there&#39;s nothing that indicates how that is to be<br/>\naccomplished - public school, private school, tutors, co-ops, home<br/>\neducation, or any combination thereof).<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
