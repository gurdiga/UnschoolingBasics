We were<br/>\ngetting up early to head over to Hickory NC for a homeschooling<br/>\nconference Saturday morning. So I&#39;ll just post some random stuff<br/>\nthat&#39;s been going on over here lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conference was a lot of fun and we met some new folks from the<br/>\nlists. The NC crew did a great job organizing that event, I imagine<br/>\nthe attendance will be even higher next year. I got to hang out with<br/>\nKelly too...that&#39;s always great!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids had a ball playing and reconnecting with some of their<br/>\nfriends. We hung out at the Asheville mall on the way home. We left<br/>\nTrevor there, with Moira&#39;s family (his gf) and we won&#39;t see him for a<br/>\nweek. It&#39;s weird having him gone more lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of us picked up some Cinnabons which are making the house<br/>\nsmell lovely this morning. Ciara and Jalen have been building box<br/>\n&quot;houses&quot; for the baby kitties and re-arranging their area over and<br/>\nover. Jalen gets this veeerrrry high-pitched squeaky voice when he<br/>\ntalks to the kittens. It cracks us up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re getting ready to celebrate Jared&#39;s birthday tomorrow, with a<br/>\nfriend that has a birthday close to him. We&#39;ll have an airsoft battle<br/>\nin the backyard. I&#39;m trying to have a quiet, calm morning after a<br/>\nhectic week so I can re-charge before we run around for party supplies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an Imagination Tribe trade to work on, a floor to mop and<br/>\nsnacks to buy. Ciara and I will do our soapy-water--all-over-the-floor<br/>\nmopping. Lotsa fun.:) We get lots of soapy water and splash it<br/>\neverywhere then zoom around with rags on our feet. After that, we get<br/>\ntowels and throw them down to soak it all up. Voila! Clean floors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe exciting news this week was Jalen losing another tooth (his<br/>\nsecond) which he has proudly showed anyone who stands still long<br/>\nenough, Ciara writing her first chapter for a book, Jared reaching<br/>\nlevel 60 on World of Warcraft and Trevor going off to NC to help his<br/>\ngf move into her college dorm.<br/>\n<br/>\nOH, and Jalen&#39;s watermelons he is growing are getting BIG.

Since the heat in the middle of the day has been just<br/>\nunbearable this past week we have started getting up around 5 to work in<br/>\nthe early cool of the morning. Yesterday about the time it got<br/>\nunbearable we all got in the river and went for a wade. Ended up walking<br/>\nabout two miles upstream looking for wood to carve and other fun things<br/>\nlike frogs and snakes. The boys found a ring-necked snake, some turkey<br/>\nfeathers, and a baby squirrel that had fallen from a nest. They are<br/>\ntaking turns nursing that squirrel so I guess some one was up tending<br/>\nthe poor thing. I&#39;m hoping it will live but doubtful.
