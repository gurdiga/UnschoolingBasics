I do think people here have given so much  <br/>\nconscious thought to living a happy, peaceful life, that it makes  <br/>\nsense that someone would want to ask here when they&#39;re having trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we can offer some ideas --<br/>\n<br/>\n--- sounds like some pretty serious depression/anxiety and many of us  <br/>\nhave experienced that. As unschoolers, it is critical that parents  <br/>\nhave positive outlooks on life - I don&#39;t believe unschooling is a  <br/>\ngood idea for families with parents who are depressed/anxious. So,  <br/>\nthe writer seems to know that it is important to take care of herself  <br/>\n- but when in the midst of depression, it is very hard to know what  <br/>\nto do about it. If you have medical coverage of ANY kind, see your  <br/>\ndoctor, please. Very often they&#39;ll help you figure out some concrete  <br/>\nthings you can really do and just a few small things can make a huge  <br/>\ndifference. They might give you some anti-depressant medication -  <br/>\nagain, just a bit of that for a short time can turn your life around,  <br/>\nget you on a different, positive, path. In the meantime, try St.  <br/>\nJohn&#39;s Wort -- I am NOT a believer in homeopathy or most herbs - a  <br/>\ntotal skeptic - but St. John&#39;s Wort has enough clinical evidence  <br/>\nbehind it to satisfy even me. It won&#39;t hurt; it can be very very  <br/>\nhelpful for mild to moderate depression. Combine that with some  <br/>\nexercise - don&#39;t be too ambitious - just go for a 20 minutes walk  <br/>\nonce a day. That can also do wonders! If you&#39;re not sleeping well,  <br/>\nplease be sure to tell your doctor that, too, because it is very  <br/>\ndifficult to dig yourself out of depression and anxiety if you&#39;re not  <br/>\nsleeping. You can get help for that, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Are you making the kids do the life-pacs now, during the summer?  <br/>\nWhy?<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"i am confused!","postDate":"1152737704","msgId":15680,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5M25qOCs3dG1kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15679,"nextInTopic":15712,"prevInTime":15679,"nextInTime":15681,"topicId":15679,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~my oldest has to be threatened with grounding from the xbox and mo-ped to get him to bathe. :)~ How about this... quit threatening anyone.
