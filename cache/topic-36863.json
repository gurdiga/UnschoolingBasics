Gamefly is great for Megan. She is very specific about which games she wants to play and Gamefly has a large selection.  She likes to check out the graphics of a game before she orders it and Gamefly has screen shots as well as reviews.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a DS that I bought so I could play games with Megan (some of the games are multi-player, but you only need one copy of the game).  I also use my DS to keep Zoe(2) distracted when Megan wants to play and Zoe wants to help.  I also have a couple of games (Brain Age which Megan isn&#39;t interested in and Elite Beat Agents which Megan is very good at)<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now Megan is playing &quot;Littlest Pet Shop: Jungle&quot;.
