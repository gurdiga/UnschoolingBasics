My parents, although actually having every intention of being loving, and often succeeding, are rather fearful people. On top of that they are retired teachers (kindergarten -very impoverished area, and college art). So not only did they feel terrified that I was sentencing the children to abysmal ignorance, but also felt I was rejecting their careeres/life choices. We endured several years in which they were very hurtful to me and the kids--they really believed that the situation was desperate. I finally had to gently tell them that while I appreciated that they meant this all with love, that these were my kids, and they were pretty much going to have to shape up or be denied access to the kids. It was so hard to do, and thank God I had supportive friends. You may just have to do what you<br/>\n know is right...they may not agree ahead!  <br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: jentamar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jenniferlehman@...\">jenniferlehman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, March 16, 2007 10:57:57 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] new member -- question<br/>\n<br/>\nHi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Jennifer and I&#39;m the mom of a 3 1/2 year old boy. We live <br/>\nin Guelph, Ontario, Canada. I&#39;ve been reading the posts for the <br/>\nlast couple weeks and appreciating them soooo much. This approach <br/>\nof unschooling and the parenting style that goes with it just seems <br/>\nso loving and respectful to the child. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy question/request for support is this: I&#39;ve recently started <br/>\ntelling family members that my son won&#39;t be going to school in the <br/>\nfall; instead we&#39;ll be homeschooling, and it hasn&#39;t gone over well. <br/>\nMy dad just called to tell me that they&#39;re concerned that it&#39;s not <br/>\ngood for my son to get the message that my whole world revolves <br/>\naround him, and by homeschooling, I&#39;m sending this message. They <br/>\nthink it&#39;s best for my son to see me as someone with a career and <br/>\nlots of interests outside of the family. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was caught off guard by this conversation and didn&#39;t really know <br/>\nhow to respond. I did say that what I love most of all is being <br/>\nwith my son and didn&#39;t see any point in going off to work all day if <br/>\nthat&#39;s not what I want. I also think that as he gets older, I may <br/>\nhave more time to pick up other interests. But what do you think? <br/>\nIs it unhealthy for a child to see his mother focused so much on him <br/>\neach day? How would you answer someone who has this concern?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your thoughts,<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22284,"nextTopicId":22292}}
