It helps me feel better to know that even if it is difficult on my part, that this is exactly what she needs at this moment in her life.  It makes it easier to just let go and go with the flow and know that it is the right thing.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; There is a couple of things that maybe I did not explain too well.  My dd is a very determined girl and sometimes she&#39;ll make up &quot;rules&quot; as to how we play that are a bit restrictive to me but she knows it will get her my full attention. (I think).  For instance,  I&#39;ve suggested many times that we continue playing while I make dinner.  I could very easily &quot;talk&quot; for the dolls while doing that.  I just wouldn&#39;t be able to move them around.  Most of the time they just sit and &quot;talk&quot;anyway.  Or, I&#39;ll tell her, when we have to run an errand, that we can continue playing in the car or anywhere else as we do what we need to.  We&#39;ll just take them along.  That works occassionally, however, mostly its &quot;no, we&#39;ll play when we get back&quot;.  Then its &quot;how much longer&quot;,  &quot;can we go home now and play dolls&quot; Or  she&#39;ll bargain with me and say &quot; ok, we&#39;ll go out.  But you can only go one place and afterwards you have to play with me for 6 hours.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Also, you guys make it sound like its so easy to go for a bathroom break!   If I just get up and go she&#39;ll drill me as to what I&#39;ll be doing in there and will literally be upset if its anything more than a short pee.  Forget telling her matter of factly about having to throw in a basket of laundry.  I get an attitude from her if I fold laundry and tell her &quot;let&#39;s continue playing, I can still talk for the babies&quot;, or whatever we&#39;d be playing at the moment.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; She makes rules, such as, the playing can only take place on the living room carpet or dining room carpet and occasionally the steps is allowed.  It cannot be on  any couches or in the kitchen and I cannot be doing anything that even looks like a distraction.  Like sometimes I&#39;ll try thumbing thru a magazine or book while my &quot;kids&quot; are sleeping.  That is not allowed.  ( I&#39;m laughing as I write this, as it seems funny now)  I think she makes these rules so that I pay the strictest attention and that I remain focused and serious and not fall asleep.  I may tell her my back hurts from sitting on the floor so much (the truth). So then she&#39;ll allow me to sit on a folding chair, but no couch.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m laughing now as I talk about this craziness but I do wonder if she is not manipulating the situation.  Does anyone else have it this crazy?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Its not like she doesn&#39;t have anything else she likes to do.  We have plenty of games and manipulative toys and puzzles and of course the computer, and she loves art.  I have many different art stuff like crayons, markers, acrylic paint, water color, etc and she loves doing it.  What always amazes me is that when I am busyy with housework she prefers TV over anything else.  She will only do those things if I am doing them with her.  But then we come back to the same thing. If I am with her she&#39;d rather play pretend.  That&#39;s another thing that frustrates me is that if I&#39;m busy she will watch TV to the point where she is bored of it but will continue watching if I&#39;m not done rather than picking up another activity for a change.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; When she has a friend over she&#39;ll refuse to play pretend with any of them.  She may color,paint or do arts and crafts, play ball sometimes dress up but with no dolls.  Everything but dolls.  When I ask her why not, especially when the other kids would love to play with her dolls, she just says its not the same as playing with me.  I think maybe its because she has such an attachment to some of her dolls that they are like her kids and the other kid will turn it into something else.  Then again, I could be wrong.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Sorry about rambling so, but I guess I never sorted all this out.  You guys had asked me what kinds of play does she do when we pretend.  We&#39;ll its mostly babies.  She keeps getting pregnant, having a big stomach and then giving &quot;birth&quot;  and of course she is the best mommy ever.  Nurses them, diapers, takes care when they are sick...  She even went so far as to get nursing books out of the library and so now she knows how to nurse twins as well!  Sometimes its one baby, other times it could be as many as 8, octuplets!  and of course she takes care of shopping, cleaning, cooking etc.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes she&#39;ll switch to being a big sister and we go thru her growing into a teenager year by year,  then she&#39;ll get her drivers license, job, and/or college... we even have a wedding ceremony, and then of course there are the babies!  That&#39;s basically the theme nowadays.  Occasionally it will vary with the jobs or things she does as she &quot;grows&quot; in the game.  Like she might be learning ballet, or she&#39;s a great artist from Paris, or a checkout person, or a doctor, vet, various therapists, librarian or rock star,etc.  And let me tell you she goes all out.  She tries to dress the part as authentically as possible.  (I do have a mountain of dress up clothes along with make up.  When she doesn&#39;t find what shes looking for there, there is always my closet that she raids..)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I know some day I&#39;ll look back at these days with fond memories.  I do already see how her pretend play has evolved, and that&#39;s one reason why I continue it.  I know that&#39;s where she got her strong thinking skills. She is also able to speak very well.  It always amazes me how she&#39;s able to hold a conversation with adults and its only afterwards that they tell me that they had to remind themselves that this is a 7/8 year old.  She&#39;s able to offer advice and suggestions and reassurances that are wise beyond her years.  I attribute that to the &quot;conversations&quot; we have when we play.  We resolve &quot;issues&quot; or talk about many things when I come to &quot;visit&quot;etc<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; You are right when you say that it may not always look like what we want learning to look like, but it is there.  Thank you for reminding me.  Its nice to have a bit of encouragement and to be set back on track when we get a bit lost and our vision gets a bit out of focus.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Rebecca <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301676677,"authorName":"Monica Van Stelton","from":"Monica Van Stelton &lt;tatyland_usa@...&gt;","profile":"tatyland_usa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] pretend play","postDate":"1256528566","msgId":41923,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NzYwMi45MTMwMC5xbUB3ZWI1NjEwNS5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEFCMjA2MzZFLTVBMDktNDVENS04MjJFLTg4MUNERjg3MzExREB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":41922,"nextInTopic":41924,"prevInTime":41922,"nextInTime":41924,"topicId":5302,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Joyce,More accurately, she s old enough to do that when she s ready to do  that.

That can be really challenging! I know!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow are you dealing with her &quot;attitude&quot; as you call it? Are you walking on tiptoes trying not to set her off? Sometimes it can be better, in terms of being less stressful all around, to learn to be okay with the knowledge that, whatever you do, there are going to be rough parts to the day, maybe even meltdowns. A lot of tension can go into trying to avoid those kinds of situations, and yet that very tension can make it harder to communicate openly, to comiserate with an unhappy child even when you&#39;re the trigger for that unhappiness. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I may tell her my back hurts from sitting on the floor so much (the truth).

Does anyone else have it this crazy?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like maybe you&#39;ve given some unclear messages to her about what your boundaries are, and she&#39;s taking advantage of that. Its good to stretch one&#39;s boundaries with young children, and kids with bigger needs, but its not good to become a doormat in the process! If you&#39;re okay with sitting in the folding chair, that&#39;s one thing, but if you need to be on the couch to be comfortable, then that&#39;s Not really okay. Your boundaries matter. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve been downplaying your own needs to avoid meltdowns, its good to notice that and be clearer about what your needs and boundaries are. The goal in unschooling isn&#39;t to create an environment where a child is never unhappy, never has a meltdown. In fact, part of what unschooling can offer children is a safe environment in which to learn about dealing with big, negative emotions. Unlike conventional parenting, we&#39;re not setting kids up to fail and experience those negative emotions, but we&#39;re also not trying to get rid of disappointment and frustration entirely - for one thing its not possible! And for another, its not healthy. Negative emotions are a part of life, and kids can learn to have better tools for dealing with those feelings by having a sympathetic parent supporting them during those times.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you haven&#39;t given much in the way of detail in that area so I may be going off on a complete tangent to your issues - if so, nevermind! <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136944076,"authorName":"Jenna Robertson","from":"Jenna Robertson &lt;mamamole@...&gt;","profile":"Mamamole","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: pretend play","postDate":"1256489961","msgId":41916,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgzNTE5MS41OTQ2My5xbUB3ZWI2NTcwOC5tYWlsLmFjNC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":41915,"nextInTopic":41917,"prevInTime":41915,"nextInTime":41917,"topicId":5302,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Another reason she may not want to play w/ friends is that they won t give her the same absolute control of the situation that you do.  While some children","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-647932148\">Another reason she may not want to play w/ friends is that they won&#39;t give her the same absolute control of the situation that you do.  While some children will give the other child control, most want to have say in the situation and work out the plot of their dramatic play together.  This can lead to conflict, but learning to resolve that conflict is part of learning how relationships work.       <br/>\n <br/>\nIs there a dad in the picture?  If so, what kind of relationship/what activities do they share?<br/>\n <br/>\n:)<br/>\nJenna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;If I had influence with the good fairy who is supposed to preside over the christening of all children, I would ask that her gift to each child in the world be a sense of wonder so indestructible that it would last throughout life.&quot; <br/>\n               - Rachel Carson <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: pretend play","postDate":"1256489192","msgId":41915,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcxNDMxRTRCNjNFMDQ0QzBBNThCMzREMTg0RUNDQURDQExZTEFMQVAyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDcwMDU4NC43MDUwNy5xbUB3ZWI2NTUxMi5tYWlsLmFjNC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDcwMDU4NC43MDUwNy5xbUB3ZWI2NTUxMi5tYWlsLmFjNC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":41914,"nextInTopic":41916,"prevInTime":41914,"nextInTime":41916,"topicId":5302,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"rebecca, have you read playful parenting by larry cohen? you might get some good ideas in there for ways to work in, in a therapeutic  way, any issues you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1520013682\">rebecca, have you read &quot;playful parenting&quot; by larry cohen?<br/>\n<br/>\nyou might get some good ideas in there for ways to work in, in a &quot;therapeutic&quot;  way, any issues you think she might be struggling with, that are inspiring her rules, control, and seeming anxiety around your attention and the pretend games.  <br/>\n<br/>\nwarmly, lyla<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":292945730,"authorName":"Rebecca","from":"Rebecca &lt;rbccelkoby@...&gt;","profile":"rbccelkoby","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: pretend play","postDate":"1256479314","msgId":41914,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg4NzkwOS4xMjgyNy5xbUB3ZWI2NTUwNy5tYWlsLmFjNC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhjMWlwdSs0bWZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41913,"nextInTopic":41915,"prevInTime":41913,"nextInTime":41915,"topicId":5302,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you so much for the article, Melinda,   This is just the article I need to keep me going!  It certainly boosted my energy!

(I think).  For instance,  I&#39;ve suggested many times that we continue playing while I make dinner.  I could very easily &quot;talk&quot; for the dolls while doing that.  I just wouldn&#39;t be able to move them around.  Most of the time they just sit and &quot;talk&quot;anyway.  Or, I&#39;ll tell her, when we have to run an errand, that we can continue playing in the car or anywhere else as we do what we need to.  We&#39;ll just take them along.  That works occassionally, however, mostly its &quot;no, we&#39;ll play when we get back&quot;.  Then its &quot;how much longer&quot;,  &quot;can we go home now and play dolls&quot; Or  she&#39;ll bargain with me and say &quot; ok, we&#39;ll go out.  But you can only go one place and afterwards you have to play with me for 6 hours.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, you guys make it sound like its so easy to go for a bathroom break!   If I just get up and go she&#39;ll drill me as to what I&#39;ll be doing in there and will literally be upset if its anything more than a short pee.  Forget telling her matter of factly about having to throw in a basket of laundry.  I get an attitude from her if I fold laundry and tell her &quot;let&#39;s continue playing, I can still talk for the babies&quot;, or whatever we&#39;d be playing at the moment.  <br/>\n <br/>\nShe makes rules, such as, the playing can only take place on the living room carpet or dining room carpet and occasionally the steps is allowed.  It cannot be on  any couches or in the kitchen and I cannot be doing anything that even looks like a distraction.  Like sometimes I&#39;ll try thumbing thru a magazine or book while my &quot;kids&quot; are sleeping.  That is not allowed.  ( I&#39;m laughing as I write this, as it seems funny now)  I think she makes these rules so that I pay the strictest attention and that I remain focused and serious and not fall asleep.  I may tell her my back hurts from sitting on the floor so much (the truth). So then she&#39;ll allow me to sit on a folding chair, but no couch.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m laughing now as I talk about this craziness but I do wonder if she is not manipulating the situation.  Does anyone else have it this crazy?<br/>\n <br/>\nIts not like she doesn&#39;t have anything else she likes to do.  We have plenty of games and manipulative toys and puzzles and of course the computer, and she loves art.  I have many different art stuff like crayons, markers, acrylic paint, water color, etc and she loves doing it.  What always amazes me is that when I am busyy with housework she prefers TV over anything else.  She will only do those things if I am doing them with her.  But then we come back to the same thing. If I am with her she&#39;d rather play pretend.  That&#39;s another thing that frustrates me is that if I&#39;m busy she will watch TV to the point where she is bored of it but will continue watching if I&#39;m not done rather than picking up another activity for a change.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen she has a friend over she&#39;ll refuse to play pretend with any of them.  She may color,paint or do arts and crafts, play ball sometimes dress up but with no dolls.  Everything but dolls.  When I ask her why not, especially when the other kids would love to play with her dolls, she just says its not the same as playing with me.  I think maybe its because she has such an attachment to some of her dolls that they are like her kids and the other kid will turn it into something else.  Then again, I could be wrong.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nSorry about rambling so, but I guess I never sorted all this out.  You guys had asked me what kinds of play does she do when we pretend.  We&#39;ll its mostly babies.  She keeps getting pregnant, having a big stomach and then giving &quot;birth&quot;  and of course she is the best mommy ever.  Nurses them, diapers, takes care when they are sick...  She even went so far as to get nursing books out of the library and so now she knows how to nurse twins as well!  Sometimes its one baby, other times it could be as many as 8, octuplets!  and of course she takes care of shopping, cleaning, cooking etc.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes she&#39;ll switch to being a big sister and we go thru her growing into a teenager year by year,  then she&#39;ll get her drivers license, job, and/or college... we even have a wedding ceremony, and then of course there are the babies!  That&#39;s basically the theme nowadays.  Occasionally it will vary with the jobs or things she does as she &quot;grows&quot; in the game.  Like she might be learning ballet, or she&#39;s a great artist from Paris, or a checkout person, or a doctor, vet, various therapists, librarian or rock star,etc.  And let me tell you she goes all out.  She tries to dress the part as authentically as possible.  (I do have a mountain of dress up clothes along with make up.  When she doesn&#39;t find what shes looking for there, there is always my closet that she raids..)<br/>\n <br/>\nI know some day I&#39;ll look back at these days with fond memories.  I do already see how her pretend play has evolved, and that&#39;s one reason why I continue it.  I know that&#39;s where she got her strong thinking skills. She is also able to speak very well.  It always amazes me how she&#39;s able to hold a conversation with adults and its only afterwards that they tell me that they had to remind themselves that this is a 7/8 year old.  She&#39;s able to offer advice and suggestions and reassurances that are wise beyond her years.  I attribute that to the &quot;conversations&quot; we have when we play.  We resolve &quot;issues&quot; or talk about many things when I come to &quot;visit&quot;etc<br/>\n <br/>\nYou are right when you say that it may not always look like what we want learning to look like, but it is there.  Thank you for reminding me.  Its nice to have a bit of encouragement and to be set back on track when we get a bit lost and our vision gets a bit out of focus.<br/>\n <br/>\nRebecca <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209361242,"authorName":"JJ","from":"&quot;JJ&quot; &lt;jrossedd@...&gt;","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: pretend play","postDate":"1256476286","msgId":41911,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhjMWlwdSs0bWZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4RDY4MENBLUExQkEtNDU0RC04MjA1LTVGQzg5NUFDN0RENUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":41910,"nextInTopic":41912,"prevInTime":41910,"nextInTime":41912,"topicId":5302,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If this will help you believe that you are doing wonderful things for your child by playing wit her to her heart s content: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-98696827\">If this will help you believe that you are doing wonderful things for your child by playing wit her to her heart&#39;s content:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-serious-need-for-play\">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-serious-need-for-play</a><br/>\n<br/>\nScientific American Mind - January 28, 2009<br/>\nThe Serious Need for Play<br/>\nFree, imaginative play is crucial for normal social, emotional and <br/>\ncognitive development.

I still have this underlying niggeling anxiety that I try my best to ignore.  My daughter is enjoying &quot;homeschooling&quot; very much.  She loves to play with her baby dolls alot.  If I did not run out of energy she would play all day and even forgo eating sometimes.  If I say lets stop for a rest and do something else such as eating, or going out or playing a game etc., she gets very upset.  She will sometimes tell me that I hardly played when we&#39;d been playing for hours.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI mostly enjoy playing with her except after a while I do need a break.  It&#39;s hard pretending to be a &quot;mom&quot; and pretend to do the things that I have to do in real life, for hours.  My brain just needs to be more stimulated.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when we play, I pretty much follow her lead.  I was wondering if it is ok to try and incorporate a bit more complex situations into the play.  For instance, when we play that she is a teenager who works as a checkout person, is it all right to actually ask how much things cost and have her add them together?  She played that once or twice but started being upset about adding the amounts together.  She&#39;ll tell me not to bother with that and just make up pretend numbers or say we are not playing like that.  It&#39;s like she&#39;d rather just go thru the motions in general but no headwork..  I feel that this may be an opportunity to incorporate some more thinking into the play she already likes to do, seeing as we don&#39;t have many opportunities to work with numbers.  In general, she mentally shuts down and refuses to hear any discussion or even a comment about numbers.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it normal for a kid to want to play so much pretend?  We&#39;ve been doing this for years already.  She does not tire of it.  I know kids get some benefit from playing and are ultimately learning something that they need and that it may not always be recognizable to us, as parents.  But,shouldn&#39; t she have worked out any issues or figured out what she needs to by now? I know its a weird question but this playing is almost an obssesion with her.  If it were up to her we&#39;d play all day and never see daylight(of course it can&#39;t be played anywhere else but at home, believe me I&#39;ve tried)and forgo eating.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking maybe its something I&#39;m just not seeing.

The bigger issue seems to be that she&#39;s wanting the play with you, and you&#39;re getting tired. Will she play with anyone else? Are there kids or even other adults you can arrange play dates with? That was something we did with Ray when he was younger and soooooo social. He was active, too, so we looked for active young people who could play at 90mph!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I mostly enjoy playing with her except after a while I do need a break.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I totally understand! Have you talked with her about this? I think Ray was six or seven when we started talking about the needs of introverts vs extraverts. He really didn&#39;t know that Everyone in the whole world didn&#39;t love to socialize Allllll the time! Why would he think that? He loved to socialize, after all. So we explained about George and I needing quiet time and time by ourselves, let him know that it was about us, not him, something we needed so that we could be better at the social stuff. He offered us some time in the mornings, when he&#39;d play in his room by himself until a certain time, then we&#39;d have breakfast together and the day&#39;s social marathon would begin. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;If I say lets stop for a rest and do something else such as eating, or going out or playing a game etc., she gets very upset. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nBring food where the play is - or vice versa. Joyce gave you the link on monkey platters. You could also suggest moving the play to wherever you need to get some work done. Bring toys into the kitchen and play while you get food ready. Offer to play something that lets you get the laundry done at the same time. Make it as much of a win-win as you can by saying &quot;I want to keep playing, but I also want to do xyz, how can we do both?&quot; You might also start the day with a plan: &quot;I want to do these things today, how can we do that and play at the same time?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, when we play, I pretty much follow her lead.

Otherwise you&#39;re interrupting something she&#39;s very busy doing - learning! Her learning isn&#39;t going to look like you expect. Its going to look like play. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; It&#39;s like she&#39;d rather just go thru the motions in general but no headwork.. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some kids learn to speak by getting an overview of language but not bothering with words for years. Some kids learn to write by &quot;pretend writing&quot; for years, picking up the overview of what writing looks like before ever troubling with words or spelling. Do you see where I&#39;m going with this? Going through the motions in a general way Is a learning strategy. It just doesn&#39;t look like you thought it would.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read a book, I generally skim through the first time, just to get the plot in my head and all the characters sorted out. That&#39;s it. It took me years not to feel bad about that, because school insists that you start pulling books apart from the first page. Is this foreshadowing? Is that a metaphor? I like looking for all that literary hoo-haa the second and third and fortieth times through (I&#39;m a chronic re-reader). You can think of the way your dd is learning along those lines, if you like. She wants the whole picture, first, and will gradually add details as she&#39;s ready for them. They may not be the details you expect! As Joyce pointed out, she may be far more into parsing out the details of a social interaction than the numbers, and that&#39;s okay. She&#39;s learning what&#39;s important to her right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor that matter, if she&#39;s wanting to learn about mathematics globally then throwing numbers at her is only confusing the issue, in her mind. She&#39;s not ready for that. She&#39;s still internalizing what numbers and patterns Do, what they&#39;re For. She&#39;s learning the big concepts and will plug numbers into that later. Don&#39;t scare her away from those numbers! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;shouldn&#39;t she have worked out any issues or figured out what she needs to by now?

Play is how children learn. My 8yo plays pretty much all day long, although she&#39;s more of an introvert than Ray was at the same age (whew! once was enough! I really do sympathize!). What Kinds of things does you dd play? Maybe we can help you see the variety of things she&#39;s learning about.

Yes, it&#39;s hard to  <br/>\ndo what you&#39;re doing. Focusing on how hard it is makes it harder.  <br/>\nRather than trying to pull away from her to meet your needs, find a  <br/>\ntime to carve out for yourself. Early in the morning.

It&#39;s just not the kind you&#39;re looking for.  <br/>\nConstructing stories, sifting through possibilities (which *is*  <br/>\nmath), and working through relationships is a lot of headwork.  <br/>\nWriting novels is hard work.

The more you push, the more she&#39;ll associate  <br/>\nnumbers with your pushing and the feelings that rouses in her.

I was wondering if it is ok to try and incorporate a bit more complex situations into the play.

She played that once or twice but started being upset about adding the amounts together.  She&#39;ll tell me not to bother with that and just make up pretend numbers or say we are not playing like that.  It&#39;s like she&#39;d rather just go thru the motions in general but no headwork..

She couldn&#39;t just go and touch and feel and <br/>\nexplore it and learn by trial and error.  Each station in the room <br/>\nhad a direct and orderly way in which it was to be used.  No <br/>\nvariation on a them.  Step 1, step 2, step 3 in that order always.  <br/>\nIf a child skipped to step 3, he was directed back to step 1 to <br/>\nstart again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think most children learn better when they work it out <br/>\nthemselves.  Some will ask for direction and want to know the steps <br/>\nwhile others want to know what the end product is and then be left <br/>\nalone to figure out how to get from point A to point B and still <br/>\nother children just want the tools and to be left alone to explore <br/>\nit and manipulate it to its fullest extent.  They are all valid <br/>\nforms of learning, but when you are in school, even the best of <br/>\nschools, rarely are you given the freedom to choose how you wish to <br/>\nlearn.  You are taught using one formula (usually that which the <br/>\nteacher learns easiest through or has been taught to teach.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I hear often from my mother is, &quot;Think how much <br/>\nbetter your children would be in school!&quot;  In her world if they are <br/>\nso brilliant and wonderful without school then *certainly* they <br/>\nwould be even more brilliant and more wonderful in school.  In <br/>\nactuality, I think that they would be less brilliant and less <br/>\nwonderful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDo I have all the knowledge needed to teach my children everything <br/>\nthat they need to know?  No.  I&#39;ll freely admit it. What I do have <br/>\nis the ability to provide for them the resources and opportunities <br/>\nto learn the things that they want.  I now about a thimble full of <br/>\ninformation on ancient Egypt, yet my 12 yo can talk circles around <br/>\nme on the subject.  Everything from the religion to kings and <br/>\nsuccessions and how pyramids were built and what copic jars were <br/>\nfor.  When she said she wanted to learn about Egypt, we went to the <br/>\nlibrary, checked out a few dozen (probably hundred by now) books on <br/>\nEgypt, found cool and interesting websites about Egypt and drew <br/>\nreams of pages of hieroglyphs.  (And I still know squat about Egypt <br/>\nLOL!)  So one doesn&#39;t need to know everything about everything in <br/>\norder to properly provide for their children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] help me choose!!","postDate":"1112036729","msgId":5316,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM0ZmY0MTYwYmRkNGMxYTRhNDBkMzk3MzY0YThiMDJhQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM1MzNhYyQyNWNlNWQ4MCQxNzYyOWYwNEBwYXZpbGlvbj4=","referencesHeader":"PGQyNDVncitucXUwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ZGRmMGVlNTFjODczYzdiOTczMTE4MzM2OWQwNDk0MDFAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4gPDAwMDAwMWM1MzNhYyQyNWNlNWQ4MCQxNzYyOWYwNEBwYXZpbGlvbj4="},"prevInTopic":5315,"nextInTopic":5318,"prevInTime":5315,"nextInTime":5317,"topicId":5302,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Its a shame that people took her philosophy and decided they still had to &quot;control&quot; the kids. <br/>\n  Not saying I would put my kids in school. Maria&#39;s study was for kids that where very poor and had no parents around so it was sort of an unschooling class so kids like that had a place to go. She actually started with mentally disable kids.<br/>\n  Kids did whatever they wanted and learned at their own pace and were never told what to do. She actually did not want &quot;teachers&quot; in the group but just someone to be there if the kids had any questions. The groups were also mixed and not separated by age.<br/>\n  I have read someof her books and all I have read about people here that have their kids in Montessori school is a shame.<br/>\n  Alex<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; Their life journey can take many twists and turns, it&#39;s never too<br/>\n  &gt; late for them to develop more of an interest in all those lovely<br/>\n  &gt; artistic/musical things that Montessori seems to value.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Waldorf, maybe.

I looked at the table at our house and saw a <br/>\n  wide variety of paper styles and lots of different kinds of markers, <br/>\n  crayons, pencils, pens, and paints and watched her tear paper and cut <br/>\n  it into little pieces and use glue and glitter and make a mess and be <br/>\n  truly creative.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The specialized equipment is cute. The &quot;lessons&quot; in how to use it can <br/>\n  be truly obnoxious - have you ever actually watched a Montessori <br/>\n  teacher giving a 3-period lesson? Suppose they want to teach a child <br/>\n  the names of some barnyard animals - they first instruct the children <br/>\n  by telling them &quot;This is a pig. This is a horse.&quot; Then they ask, &quot;Which <br/>\n  is the pig? Which is the horse?&quot; Then they ask the child, &quot;What is <br/>\n  this? What is this?&quot; Always the same three steps.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you really think that kids at home with their families need this? <br/>\n  They learn by experience, by asking questions, by noticing what other <br/>\n  people called things, by trial and error, and so on. They learn in <br/>\n  THEIR own ways - each unique. Learning is not a &quot;logical progression&quot; <br/>\n  as Montessori schools would like to make out - it happens in fits and <br/>\n  starts, but all the time, and it isn&#39;t always observable and it <br/>\n  consists of making connections, thousands of connections, and each <br/>\n  person&#39;s brain does this differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Do any <br/>\nof<br/>\nyou worry about this? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere do you feel your education is lacking? If you believe in self-<br/>\neducation, then you can correct the perceived deficit at any time in <br/>\nyour life, right?:)<br/>\nWith unschooling, it isn&#39;t the parent imparting knowledge to the <br/>\nchild, so it isn&#39;t how much the parent is &quot;educated&quot; or not that <br/>\nmakes the difference.<br/>\nWhat I believe is absolutely essential, is the parents willingness <br/>\nto learn, to be curious, to get excited about life, to have <br/>\ninterests of their own and open the world to  their child(ren).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you feel your child would benefit from the activities you listed, <br/>\nthen bring them into your home!! If you don&#39;t know how to do those <br/>\nthings and they sound interesting, then learn them WITH your <br/>\nchildren. That&#39;s the wonderful healing power of unschooling...we can <br/>\nhave the childhood of our dreams, it&#39;s never too late.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever I&#39;ve looked at those seemingly wonderful Montessori type <br/>\nprograms, I see the cost and think about how much travelling, how <br/>\nmany supplies etc...we could buy for that fee.<br/>\nHaving the school for free changes that vein of thought! But if you <br/>\nreally think about a 4 or 5 year olds ability to be gone from their <br/>\nparents, I doubt school can offer anything remotely as valuable as <br/>\nhaving Mom nearby.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about your child in terms of emotional health. What is more <br/>\nbeneficial? To be &quot;enriched&quot; by strangers, or simply to play in the <br/>\ncomfort of home?<br/>\nAll this &quot;enrichment&quot; is highly overrated in my opinion. Four year <br/>\nolds need their parents mainly, and an interesting environment at <br/>\nhome.<br/>\nIf your child has books, movies, games, toys and a loving parent, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think anything can beat that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is your oldest child, so it might be hard to try and see the <br/>\nperspective you will have when he&#39;s older. They don&#39;t need all these <br/>\nwonderful painting, drawing, music experiences at four. They just <br/>\nneed to have paper, pencils, crayons, CD&#39;s and such in their home. <br/>\nThey can learn all of those more formal things at ANY time. <br/>\n<br/>\nTheir life journey can take many twists and turns, it&#39;s never too <br/>\nlate for them to develop more of an interest in all those lovely <br/>\nartistic/musical things that Montessori seems to value. <br/>\n<br/>\nTrust your child, trust yourself. You may understand how damaging <br/>\nschool can be, but you&#39;re still letting that fear send you messages.<br/>\nTell it to go away, you&#39;re doing just fine thank you.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41988,"nextTopicId":42001}}
