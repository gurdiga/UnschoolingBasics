Alot of people call themselves <br/>\nunschoolers but dont truly GET IT, and most people who have been <br/>\nliving this lifestyle for awhile and can look back and think of THE <br/>\nmoment when they DID GET IT.

Please don&#39;t<br/>\ntake it to private conversation unless both parties are willing for<br/>\nit. I had a member emailed in a very hostile manner recently and I<br/>\nreally do NOT think that is a helpful thing to do, nor should anyone<br/>\nhave to deal with offlist emails unless they want to engage in that. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, rather than telling the list how to post, just post in the<br/>\nmanner you believe is most helpful. When posts start giving advice to<br/>\nother people about how to post, that is a meta-discussion and that<br/>\nisn&#39;t something we want on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":282257979,"authorName":"Wildflower Car","from":"&quot;Wildflower Car&quot; &lt;unschoolfool@...&gt;","profile":"red_olive5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Hostility on the Group?!?!","postDate":"1168227309","msgId":20418,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTctRjIzMzBFRjlBQTExQzhGMUQxNTc5N0ZDQUJDMEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":20421,"prevInTime":20417,"nextInTime":20419,"topicId":20418,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have noticed several post, even my own, starting to be somewhat hostile.
