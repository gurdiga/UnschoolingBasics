I used to do similar things like eating what","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-972653401\">I&#39;m coming out of lurkdom to give my opinion on this<br/>\none because I used to have a problem with &quot;wasting<br/>\nfood&quot; too. I used to do similar things like eating<br/>\nwhat was left on my kids&#39; plates because I didn&#39;t want<br/>\nto &quot;waste&quot; it. We were on an extremely tight budget<br/>\nand I let the idea of throwing away &quot;perfectly good&quot;<br/>\nfood really get to me. It seems to be my nature to<br/>\nquestion anything and everything so of course I<br/>\nquestioned my reactions to this as well. Eventually I<br/>\ncame to the realization that it wasn&#39;t the &quot;wasted&quot;<br/>\n*food* that I had a problem with, it was the &quot;wasted&quot;<br/>\n*money*. If we had plenty of money I was much less<br/>\nuptight about wasted food, but if money was tight I<br/>\nbecame uptight about food again. But sometimes even<br/>\nwhen we had plenty of money I would feel guilty about<br/>\n&quot;wasting&quot; and worry about *other* people who don&#39;t<br/>\nhave enough money. It all came down to a fear of *lack<br/>\nof money* for me. Once I started working through my<br/>\nissues with money, I began to see the &quot;wasted&quot; food in<br/>\na different light. <br/>\n<br/>\nI began to pay attention to the &quot;wasteful&quot; behavior<br/>\nthat happens in nature. If a monkey eats only half a<br/>\npiece of fruit in the wild for instance, he just<br/>\ntosses the rest on the ground. To us, this might seem<br/>\n&quot;wasteful&quot;, but in nature it serves an important<br/>\npupose. That &quot;wasted&quot; piece of fruit might feed other<br/>\nanimals and insects, decompose into nutrient rich<br/>\nsoil, and help spread seeds so that the plants<br/>\ncontinue to multiply. In nature &quot;wasting&quot; *IS* okay.<br/>\nIt&#39;s part of a very natural, very *positive* process.<br/>\nIt&#39;s all in the way you look at it. So, with that in<br/>\nmind we began to think of ways that our &quot;wasteful&quot;<br/>\nbehavior was actually *helpful* and started doing more<br/>\nthings to promote a more positive mindset about<br/>\n&quot;wasting&quot; food. Some of the things we did were things<br/>\nwe had once done that had fallen by the wayside while<br/>\nwe were busy working on our house like composting and<br/>\nstarting a worm farm. But even when we threw food out<br/>\nwe did so with a different mindset. If we were out on<br/>\na picnic and couldn&#39;t put leftovers away for instance,<br/>\nwe would &quot;feed the racoons&quot; by putting it in the trash<br/>\ncan (racoons raid trashcans pretty regularly around<br/>\nhere). If there were ducks and we had bread or<br/>\ncrackers leftover, we&#39;d feed the ducks. If something<br/>\naccidentally dropped on the ground we would leave some<br/>\nbehind for the ants and other insects. In other words,<br/>\nwe paid attention to the ways in which we were<br/>\nparticipating in nature&#39;s larger plan. After a while I<br/>\nrealized that by simply being more mindful about our<br/>\nparticipation in &quot;wasteful&quot; behavior, we actually<br/>\nbecame *LESS* wasteful! And it extended beyond just<br/>\nfood too. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that this exact mindset is what is<br/>\nnecessary for this mother however. I&#39;m simply saying<br/>\nthat examining one&#39;s own reactions and the reasons<br/>\nbehind them will probably do more good and create more<br/>\nchange than trying to change *someone else&#39;s<br/>\nbehavior*. I say that becuase it seems to me that the<br/>\nmother you mentioned is focusing a bit too much on how<br/>\nshe can change her *child&#39;s* behavior. His behavior<br/>\nsounds appropriate for his age to me. I have a soon to<br/>\nbe 3 year old daughter and her behavior is very<br/>\nsimilar sometimes. For instance, she may get an apple,<br/>\ntake two bites and then say she&#39;s done. But I also<br/>\nhave a 10 year old son who went through the same thing<br/>\nat that age. It is perfectly natural for that age and<br/>\nI know from experience with watching my son that my<br/>\ndaughter *will* grow out of it. I can trust in that<br/>\nprocess because I&#39;ve seen it before. But if this is<br/>\nthe mother&#39;s only (or oldest) child, she may have just<br/>\nnot developed that trust yet. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like there is a lot more dialogue that could<br/>\nbe going on between the mother and child. She might<br/>\nwant to talk to the child more about why he prefers<br/>\nhis routine though. (With the intention of simply<br/>\n*understanding* and not *changing* it, mind you.)<br/>\nPerhaps he just likes the predictability of it.<br/>\nPerhaps he really *wants* to like that particular kind<br/>\nof ice cream and so keeps trying it. Maybe the routine<br/>\nhas become a comfort ritual for him so he is unwilling<br/>\nto give it up just yet. Maybe the child feels the lack<br/>\nof trust coming from the mother and feels it as a lack<br/>\nof trust in *HIM* and is trying to remedy that in a<br/>\nroundabout way. Maybe he is just testing to see if his<br/>\nreaction to the ice cream will always be the same.<br/>\nThere are many reasons why he might not want to change<br/>\nthat routine just yet. Once the mother is more<br/>\naccepting of the &quot;why&quot;, then maybe the child might be<br/>\nmore open to discussing the possibility of exchanging<br/>\nthis routine for another.    <br/>\n<br/>\nJessica R. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNeed Mail bonding?<br/>\nGo to the Yahoo!
