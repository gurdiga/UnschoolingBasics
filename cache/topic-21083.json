Summerhill was first published in the US in the late 1960s,<br/>\nthough it&#39;s much older than that, and its publication triggered a wave<br/>\nof free schools at that time including Sudbury school. Many schools<br/>\nflamed out but there are ones from that time period still going strong. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am interested in opening some sort of free school down the road,<br/>\nperhaps a Sudbury school. I really like the idea of it and I like the<br/>\nopportunity to bring an unschooling experience to kids who otherwise<br/>\nmay not get it.
