I&#39;m on lots of lists so I don&#39;t usually do the<br/>\nintro thing until I&#39;m ready to jump in on a<br/>\nconversation, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done that here<br/>\nyet. I&#39;m Jessica, mom to ds Cameron and dd Catherine<br/>\nand wife of almost 14 years to Dave. We have been an<br/>\nunschooling family pretty much since my first child<br/>\nwas born, the exception being a brief period of time<br/>\nrecently when I lost my focus and we did a very<br/>\nrelaxed, eclectic homeschooling thing. It&#39;s a long<br/>\nstory but basically I came to my senses and realized<br/>\nthat I had strayed from our original path and because<br/>\nof that we were all becoming unhappy. That&#39;s the<br/>\nreason I&#39;ve joined so many unschooling lists after all<br/>\nthese years of doing it on my own - I needed to get my<br/>\nfocus back on my family and on *real* learning. Since<br/>\nI know no other unschoolers IRL I sought them out on<br/>\nline.<br/>\n<br/>\nJessica in Indiana    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nStart your day with Yahoo! - Make it your home page! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\">http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":236897304,"authorName":"frozenandcold","from":"&quot;frozenandcold&quot; &lt;fivefreebirds@...&gt;","profile":"frozenandcold","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"re: coffee for your kids?","postDate":"1132685479","msgId":7895,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRsdnBiNys3azFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7893,"nextInTopic":7901,"prevInTime":7894,"nextInTime":7896,"topicId":7876,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Bring up coffee and people start getting chatty!!
