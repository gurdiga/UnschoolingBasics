He works 365 days a week from 4 :30 in the morning until 8-9 PM and sometimes had to get up at night to check on pregnant cows or deliver babies, or sick animals.<br/>\nI do everything else, kids, home, yard. He helps me  by  cutting wood with the chain saw. I stack, load, unload and split  the easy ones. We help each other. We do not keep tabs. I do what I can to help him and he does the same to me.Since he works very very hard everyday and I get to sleep in ( he never does only when he went to the hospital) I am super nice to him. I also manage our finances, pay the bills and even sign his checks. He  just deposits the check in his account and I do the rest ( he does not even know how to log in online to his account!) <br/>\n I think it is because we are friends and trust each other. We discuss any big expense. Which for us is  like 100 dollars up for anything other than groceries!<br/>\nWe did have an agreement that if we had kids I would stay home with them. I did work until my son was almost two and took him to work until he was 13 months than my mom watched him but that was hard so I quit.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"Kelly Lovejoy","from":"Kelly Lovejoy &lt;kbcdlovejo@...&gt;","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] RE: Salary","postDate":"1352402285","msgId":49264,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDRjhCRkNFOTVCQzAyRi0xNDAtN0ZDMEB3ZWJtYWlsLWQwOTUuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAyZTAwMWNkYmRkNyQ3NTkxMDhmMCQ2MGIzMWFkMCRAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAyZTAwMWNkYmRkNyQ3NTkxMDhmMCQ2MGIzMWFkMCRAZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49263,"nextInTopic":49265,"prevInTime":49263,"nextInTime":49265,"topicId":49262,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Nope.

It makes sense to know who&#39;s going to be cooking dinner before everyone&#39;s hungry ;) And it may make sense for one person to do certain tasks based on ability or interest - for instance, for awhile I did all the stacking of firewood and hauling of trash because George wasn&#39;t able to do so. And nowadays I do all the sweeping and mopping because he&#39;s kind of oblivious to the degree of cleanliness at floor level and I like to walk around in bare feet.

I concur: throughout my 21+ years of marriage with my<br/>\nsweetie, I can&#39;t imagine doing it any other way.  Though our situation has<br/>\nchanged over time (from neither of us working, to only me working, and now,<br/>\nonly him), our bank account has always been OURS, regardless of who<br/>\ncontributes what.  And I, too, handle the books, not only because I can do<br/>\nit the fastest, but because I like the control (and my hubby doesn&#39;t mind me<br/>\nhaving it).  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept of a division of labor within a family seems to have been<br/>\nneglected over the past decade or two.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m overstating it to<br/>\nsay that a successful division of labor (whenever possible) is the keystone<br/>\nof a successful marriage.  I mean, it just makes sense not to duplicate<br/>\nlabors.  The nonsense that domestic tasks are somehow demeaning or<br/>\nunfulfilling really undermines the most important part of our life (that is,<br/>\nhome-life), and, if you think about it, is neither here nor there anyway,<br/>\nsince domestic chores must be done by SOMEBODY.  Not honoring them doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmake them go away (I&#39;ve tried!), and only serves to foster resentment.  Now,<br/>\nwhen I&#39;m vacuuming dog hair for the 80-jillionth time, I think of it as my<br/>\ncontribution to my family.  If I don&#39;t vacuum it, someone will have to,<br/>\nright?  Why would I want to give more work to my husband or son?  They&#39;re<br/>\nalready doing their own jobs.  It also helps to think of the blessings<br/>\ninvolved, and there are many: I have a house to vacuum; I have a vacuum<br/>\ncleaner to help with the task; I have a home large enough to have pets; I&#39;m<br/>\nlucky enough to have a family to take care of; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] <br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 08, 2012 12:44 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Digest Number 4710<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1a <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/49260;_ylc=X3oDMTJz\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/49260;_ylc=X3oDMTJz</a><br/>\nY2NhOWZwBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE1BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTcwNTA4MTk3MgRtc2dJ<br/>\nZAM0OTI2MARzZWMDZG1zZwRzbGsDdm1zZwRzdGltZQMxMzUyMzY0MjY5&gt; Re: salary <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWed Nov 7, 2012 5:04 am (PST) .

In the last<br/>\ncouple of years, there are more and more at home dads but for a long time it<br/>\nwas a conversation killer of sorts when meeting people &quot;What do you do?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m a fulltime stay at home dad&quot; &quot;Oh&quot; Aside from Mr. Mom comments (which<br/>\nmake me crazy - they assume men are incompetent at caring for their own<br/>\nchildren), people didn&#39;t quite know what to make of it. It&#39;s totally by<br/>\nchoice - when DS was born, we consciously decided to have one parent home<br/>\nwith him (barring unusual/unforeseen circumstances beyond our direct<br/>\ncontrol). What that has turned out to mean is that my job<br/>\nprospects/pay/benefits have me at work fulltime and hubby at home. He loves<br/>\nit. He gets to write, create, cook, explore, play videogames (he&#39;s been a<br/>\ngamer since the first home systems came out back in the day). I come home to<br/>\na hot meal and a cozy home. I make sure he knows I appreciate his work, as<br/>\nhe lets me know he appreciates me getting out of bed in the dark and cold<br/>\nand heading off to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI handle the bookkeeping stuff by mutual agreement (our first couple years<br/>\nof marriage, we traded off each year but after a couple of years, he didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant it back lol). In most cases, I just pay things as they come due but<br/>\nwhen we get additional discretionary funds (holiday bonus for example), we<br/>\ndiscuss how to allocate things. We often joke that he&#39;s the Captain and I&#39;m<br/>\nhis Executive Officer. Part of my job, as I see it, is to facilitate the<br/>\nthings our family wants to do - checking the funds and looking for ways to<br/>\nmake stuff we want happen, happen, and letting DH and DS know the options -<br/>\nwe can do X now, but that will impact Y that we were thinking about for next<br/>\nmonth. We can postpone X, postpone Y, or consider Z.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVersion: 2012.0.2221 / Virus Database: 2441/5382 - Release Date: 11/08/12<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49240,"nextTopicId":49151}}
