But she wants her hair to flow like white ppl&#39;s hair.  How do I allow free access to a media that tells my daughter she is not beautiful as she is?  How do I allow her to watch these girls knowing that deep down inside she wants to look like them?  And watching the anguish that causes her?<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Could she have hair more like she wants?  I don&#39;t know a lot about the texture of african american hair, but aren&#39;t there are product lines marketed for both natural and straightened hair?  I&#39;ve known many white girls with straight hair who perm for curl --done it myself, tho never to my satisfaction.  Maybe something temporary, like the 28 shampoo color jobs?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I remember in third grade, I saw the most beautiful little girl I&#39;d ever seen -- and her hair!  I&#39;d have given everything I had for hair like hers.  Except my hair would never look like hers did.  And it wasn&#39;t just her hair, her skin was gorgeous.  Her Mom was african-american, her dad Cherokee. Her hair was wavy and shiny, and very, very thick.  I&#39;m just basic white girl with (then) plain brown hair that only &#39;waved&#39; where I had cowlicks, and never seemed to do what I wanted it to.  I was very jealous.  I spent years trying to perm my hair -- it never came out even, or as I&#39;d expected it to. Turned out the object of my envy had a younger sister, who was later the prettiest girl my little sister had ever seen.  I still remember both girls&#39; names 35 yrs later, as does my sister.   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  When I finally got up the nerve to ask her why her hair was so shiny, she told me her grandma put vaseline on it and &#39;ironed&#39; it.  I&#39;d never heard of any kind of hair irons then -- curling or straightening.   My mother had still didn&#39;t let me have any style besides a pixie cut, because she just didn&#39;t have the time to brush my hair.  I have the kind of hair that tangles without me even moving.  It was two more years before she let me grow my hair long, and then taking care of it was completely my responsibility.  My sister begged and cried to have long hair, too, so I took over her hair care then too.  She had hair as poker straight, baby fine and the color of spun gold.  I was still very envious.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all that unusual to want to be what we&#39;re not, even when it crosses race lines.  Often, it&#39;s just a chance to try on new things, like different clothes or shoes.  I think that as long as you give a child many things about his/her own life and identity to cherish and desire, they&#39;ll find their own path -- even if it may not be exactly what a parent would have chosen (it seldom is, you know). <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Mom to Will (21) Andy (9) and Dan (5) <br/>\n     <br/>\n  Let the beauty you love be what you do  --  Rumi<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNew Yahoo!

The standards of beauty don&#39;t generally include anything I&#39;ve got! lol But at 46 I&#39;ve finally learned to just ignore those stupid standards. Right now I&#39;m the happisest with my hair that I have ever been. It&#39;s also at it&#39;s most natural, just a few highlights.

The difference is, she is happy with who she is and how she looks. She&#39;s comfortable in her own skin. She may dye her hair pink or pierce her ears, but only to complement her own sense of style. Not because she&#39;s unhappy with herself or her looks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe this is a direct result of the fact that  she has been unschooled her whole life.

We are not unschooling as of yet,still thinking about it. This e-mail list has definitely been thought provoking and taught me quite a bit as well. So no matter what choices we make, I definitely am enjoying the discussions here. I have two questions.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Do any other families here just not have a t.v.? We don&#39;t have any and I must say it&#39;s been liberating and more peaceful.You know, I&#39;m not completely against t.v.,but there just is so much else to do. And I think it can be pretty addictive.Also, there are many companies that spend millions figuring out how to market to children. I know I&#39;m not articulating all this well. But since we got rid of the t.v.(over two years ago).Both dh and I read alot more(dh especially was not a reader before) we talk more and have more sex(hey, that&#39;s what people used to do,lol.) And the kids,well they just live. It&#39;s not an issue here so I&#39;m not controlling it or censoring it. Maybe in time, this will change.I mean, maybe someone here will want a t.v. and I guess then we can discuss it.  But just my two cents, there&#39;s alot of freedom in not having one. And I really feel it opens the doors to living even more fully....<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Second question---to those who don&#39;t have a spouse around too often..Although I love spending time with my kids,sometimes I need a break .Sometimes I&#39;ve just heard enough conversations with the word &quot;poop&quot; in it.lol (remember they&#39;re 3 1/2 and almost 6). Anyway, dh leaves early and gets home after the kids are asleep. He works 6 and occasionally 7 days....We can&#39;t afford much in the way of an occasional babysitter. So how does anyone else get a break?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks, Kim  ---mama to Ethan and Kai<br/>\n    <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: the influences of the media","postDate":"1144796701","msgId":11662,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxaGNtdSs4OGZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTExMC1EQVY5QjhEMTRBMjRBRDdCRTQ3RjhFNEE5OUNEMEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":11653,"nextInTopic":11669,"prevInTime":11661,"nextInTime":11663,"topicId":11622,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter is brown (biracial:black/white) and she LOVES all the Disney Princess!

I am also not fond of the way women <br/>\nspecificly are portrayed the steriotypes are unrealistic all the way <br/>\narround. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo combat this problem My son and I talk about what messages we are <br/>\nbeing spoon fed and how and possible why&#39;s (being aware of what is <br/>\ngoing on you can kind of step away from it and look at it from an <br/>\namlost scientific point of view)- not every time we watch Tv but <br/>\nquite a lot.<br/>\n I have noticed the more we talk and think about the media and how <br/>\nit is used the more he will actualy catch things before they enter <br/>\nhis brain and get stuck in there.<br/>\n Often he will say things like &quot;what does that woman with big <br/>\nbreasts have to do with a cheeseburger?&quot; (or something similer)<br/>\n I have friends of diferent sizes, races, religions, economic <br/>\nbackgrounds, who have difering interests and abilitys that he gets <br/>\nto hang out with. I can only hope that the exposure to so many <br/>\ndiferent people will help reinforce what we talk about re: the media.<br/>\n The way we do things here has made my son very inquisitive but <br/>\nunfortunatly there are a lot of people who do not care for his <br/>\ncuriosity or the &quot;thinking comments&quot; he makes.<br/>\n (example) We were having lunch with a friend of mine who eats very <br/>\nlittle meat or sweets and we were discussing our meal and food in <br/>\ngeneral when my son looks at her and says &quot;if you dont like sweets <br/>\nand you don&#39;t eat meat how come your not skinny?&quot; <br/>\nafter a moment of stunned quiet we kind of laughed and talked about <br/>\nhow everyones body is diferent and how you can be healthy without <br/>\nbeing super thin like the TV people and then we went on to discuss <br/>\nother health/media related issues, prejudices and other things.<br/>\n if my friend was not so sweet I could see that being a huge problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nPs) gotta say I *love* the new Dove adds, with all diferent types of <br/>\nwomen. we need more media like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Maisha Khalfani&quot; <br/>\n&lt;earthspirit393@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m going to need some suggestions for this:  when it comes to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>watching tv I have relaxed quite a bit.

My daughter is 12 (13 on Friday). She is tall and skinny with dark hair and pale skin. The rage seems to be long blonde hair and dark tans on TV now and most of the 13 yo&#39;s portrayed on TV do NOT look 13 to me. They are much more &quot;filled out&quot; than what I recall 13 being and Sarah just doesn&#39;t fit that ideal. She wants to know when her butt will be bigger (her words!) so her jeans fit tight like that. We try to stress that God made her just the way He wants her to be & that she is beautiful the way she is.  I don&#39;t know what role religion/spirituality plays in your home but perhaps just remind her that her creator made her the way that he/she intended her to be and that she is beautiful as she is.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  On the other hand, does she watch That&#39;s So Raven?
