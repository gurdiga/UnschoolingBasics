Of course being his mom, I<br/>\nnotice EVERYTHING!  He has grown out of much of it now, but when he<br/>\nwas younger and displayed a &quot;problem&quot; I would look at it like this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWho&#39;s having the problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre they expressing a need to change the behavior?  (not your need,<br/>\nTHEIR need)  If they are embarrassed and have come to you with a<br/>\ndesire to change, then you can help them with pronunciation or could<br/>\nseek out solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it affecting any aspect of their life negatively.  I mean is it<br/>\ncausing them great difficulty in social interactions,  or can people<br/>\ngenerally understand them and they are enjoying conversation?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a big believer in letting kids be.  I think this day in age we<br/>\nworry too much about their quirks and differences.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut thats just me.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jenjon1964&quot;<br/>\n&lt;amparo0914@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone I hope to get some advice.
