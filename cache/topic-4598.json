He needs to trust you. Can *you* go and do  <br/>\n  some cool things? Invite him to go, but if he reuses---then GO!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Can *you* volunteer at the shelter one day/week? Just invite him along?  ONLY <br/>\n  if you&#39;re interested, of course. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Do *you* have any passions he can watch you totally get into? I have dog  <br/>\n  grooming/showing. my garden, my bees, cooking, entertaining, decorating,  <br/>\n  unschooling, & the conference. My boys *see* me doing so much. That&#39;s really  <br/>\n  important---to model what you want to see!<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lately I&#39;ve been getting a lot of questions  from the relatives about<br/>\n  how it&#39;s going, and I mostly just say OK without  many details(they&#39;re<br/>\n  not ready to understand unschooling  yet)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yeah---they need to get their noses out of your business! &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  But you can always just say, &quot;Yes! It&#39;s great! He&#39;s finally started showing  <br/>\n  real signs of healing from school-itis. Every day is better and better. I&#39;m so <br/>\n  glad to have taken this leap of faith with him.

He&#39;s just <br/>\n  &quot;digesting&quot; them.&lt;G&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am worried that he will never learn to  love<br/>\n  learning again and get out there and do things like so many of  the<br/>\n  other unschoolers I have been reading about.  Yikes!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  OK. Have *YOU* learned to love to learn again? If *YOU* have, then it IS  <br/>\n  possible. But what you&#39;re attempting to do with your son is for him to  do it <br/>\n  SOONER than at 28 or 31 or 35!<br/>\n<br/>\n  So rather than look at it as being slow to get that love of learning  <br/>\n  back----look at it as learning to love to learn SOONER! &lt;G&gt; You&#39;re  allowing him to <br/>\n  be AHEAD of the game!<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BUT, reading what you wrote Kelly, has  helped me to not fly into a<br/>\n  total panic and has strengthed my resolve to  leave him alone and not<br/>\n  force things.

I really needed to hear this today!<br/>\n I just hopped on this list to read(and do my usual lurking - I am new<br/>\nto the group)but was going to write today about my concerns with my<br/>\nson (that I just found out happen to be very similar to what you went<br/>\nthrough).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI pulled him out of 9th grade in Oct(he&#39;s 15 in April and my youngest<br/>\nand only child still at home) and I have been letting him deschool<br/>\nwhile I read as much as I could about homeschooling to figure out<br/>\n&quot;how.&quot;  After everything I&#39;ve read, I really think unschooling makes<br/>\nso much sense. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen a few positive changes in his attitude and he does read<br/>\ndifferent things on his own(he devours most things on mammals that I<br/>\nstrew in his path).  BUT, he does not want to go ANYWHERE, and does<br/>\nnot feel like socializing outside the family and has lately been<br/>\nsleeping later and later into the day.  Most of his time awake is<br/>\nspent playing online games like World of Warcraft(and I do understand<br/>\nthe value of the games so I am not complaining about that).<br/>\n<br/>\nLately I&#39;ve been getting a lot of questions from the relatives about<br/>\nhow it&#39;s going, and I mostly just say OK without many details(they&#39;re<br/>\nnot ready to understand unschooling yet)Another problem: my oldest son<br/>\nis home from college doing an internship(he completed public H.S. in 3<br/>\nyears, but disliked it), and is wondering why his brother is doing<br/>\nnothing all the time!  I thought he would &quot;get it&quot; more than anyone<br/>\nand be our biggest supporter and instead I find myself having to<br/>\ndefend homeschooling with him!<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I am getting at is that everything happening right now is<br/>\ncausing me to falter and want to slip into a &quot;school mode&quot; to justify<br/>\nsome kind of learning happening.  I am worried about starting so late<br/>\nwith my son (Can he really afford a year or more of deschooling?).  I<br/>\nam worried about the portfolio review that needs to happen in June<br/>\n(What have we got to put in it except a list of books and magazines my<br/>\nson has read?).  I am worried that he will never learn to love<br/>\nlearning again and get out there and do things like so many of the<br/>\nother unschoolers I have been reading about. Yikes!<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, reading what you wrote Kelly, has helped me to not fly into a<br/>\ntotal panic and has strengthed my resolve to leave him alone and not<br/>\nforce things.  I found exactly what I needed to &quot;hear&quot; at exactly the<br/>\nmoment I needed to hear it.  I still am freaking out some on the<br/>\ninside, but I will keep reading on this list.  It is great to have<br/>\nthis support group - you&#39;ve helped me today more than you know!!<br/>\n<br/>\nTHANK YOU!<br/>\nKim in Maine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128601079,"authorName":"iamjill4ever@wmconnect.com","from":"iamjill4ever@...","profile":"creeksidemom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] pros-cons question for Kelly","postDate":"1105160291","msgId":4601,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ1LjFmMWQ0MzM5LjJmMTBjMjYzQHdtY29ubmVjdC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4600,"nextInTopic":4639,"prevInTime":4600,"nextInTime":4602,"topicId":4598,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/7/2005 10:28:16 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

How long did it <br/>\ntake  your son to heal Kelly?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nHe left school at the end of sixth grade. He was 12.5. That summer he went  <br/>\nto Australia with People to People for three weeks. We spent the rest of the  <br/>\nsummer just hanging out. I read the .com boards and learned as much as I  could <br/>\nabout unschooling. I *understood* it, but I had a hard time putting it  into <br/>\npractice.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen loading the car for a trip, I&#39;d point out that that was geometry!  &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nI&#39;d nag him that he hadn&#39;t read anything in a while. I would read a  short <br/>\nstory to him and ask him to draw a picture of it or of how it made him  feel. <br/>\nAfter a trip, I&#39;d suggest that he write me a paper about it.<br/>\n <br/>\nYeah, yeah, yeah----I know. It took a while to make it work! &lt;bwg&gt; I  <br/>\nprobably could have knocked six-eight months off his deschooling if I&#39;d quit  nagging <br/>\nand just TRUSTED him.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe spent 18 months doing NOTHING but sleeping, watching TV, talking on the  <br/>\nphone, and eating.  Seriously. It was painful to watch. BUT he needed that  <br/>\ntime to heal. It was VERY important!<br/>\n <br/>\nSlowly, he started to do more. He started with IMing his friends. He&#39;d  hated <br/>\nthe computer in school, preferring to write assignments by hand. But  he got <br/>\n*really* fast on the computer and knew more about its capabilities than  my <br/>\nhusband or me in just a few short months.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have another son, eight years younger. We&#39;d go somewhere almost every  <br/>\nday----the park, the zoo, the beach, the library, a restaurant----*somewhere*.  <br/>\nI&#39;d ask each day whether Cameron would like to join us: his answer was always,  <br/>\n&quot;No.&quot; Then.....one day, I asked and he said, &quot;Yes!&quot; It was all I could do not <br/>\nto  jump up and do the happy dance----but I did one inside!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThen he started to join us more and more----and we started to do things HE  <br/>\nwanted to do. He started drawing again, so I bought him some really nice papers <br/>\n and charcoals. <br/>\n <br/>\nHe and his friends started skateboarding, so we got him a skateboard and  <br/>\nsent him to Camp Woodward that summer. Then he started filming other skaters, so  <br/>\nwe got him a camera. That eventually led to more filming (and his first 6.5  <br/>\nminute film). Now he volunteers at the local independent film theatre and is  <br/>\ncalled on by local film-makers to do camera work. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also asked for drums (who knows why!?), so he got drums one  Christmas. <br/>\nHe&#39;s really gotten into music. He&#39;s playing with three bands---all  different <br/>\nstyles. He&#39;s had a few lessons, but does it mostly on his own; only  going to <br/>\nDanny when he&#39;s struggling with something. He got a high-tech metronome  for <br/>\nChristmas this year. (My dad thought that was SOOOO funny---that a  child would <br/>\n*ask* for a metronome! &lt;g&gt;) He plays three-four  hours/day---sometimes more. <br/>\nLuckily, the drums are in our DEtached garage!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nHe&#39;s traveled to Seattle with Wilderness Ventures. He&#39;s made many road  trips <br/>\non his own since he got his license. He&#39;s flying out to Albuquerque  by <br/>\nhimself next month and to Europe with his cousin in September.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe has three jobs: delivering a weekly paper to businesses,  <br/>\npet/house-sitting, and catering. He has his volunteer gig at the theatre. He has  the <br/>\nfilm-making that keeps him thinking and the drumming that has him  finding/playing <br/>\ngigs at different bars every now and then.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe&#39;s so busy now ----like he&#39;s making up for those lost months.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe thought he was stupid and was going nowhere without a diploma. That&#39;s  <br/>\nwhat he heard from his friends. NOW his friends think his life is pretty sweet.  <br/>\nSo does he! &lt;g&gt; He has three friends from school that he still hangs with.  <br/>\nHis girlfriend, who is also in school. But most of his friends are in their  <br/>\n20&#39;s, with one in his 30&#39;s and 2-3 in their 40&#39;s! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nHe&#39;s into Buddhism and is a vegetarian (mostly &lt;g&gt;). He has a lot of  <br/>\nquestions and is not afraid to ask them. He LIKES his parents! &lt;g&gt; How  novel! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI just looked up at the subject. It says &quot;pros-cons question for Kelly.&quot;  <br/>\nCons: He still doesn&#39;t care to read much. He prefers non-fiction anyway---always  <br/>\nhas. Fiction he prefers through movies. Well, documentaries too! He just <br/>\nprefers  his information that way. But he reads just fine. <br/>\n <br/>\nHe has his own back accounts and has been overdrawn once in three  years. I <br/>\ndoubt that&#39;ll happen again soon! &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\nHe sat in on a college class last spring and was appalled at how little  the <br/>\nstudents wanted to be there. He liked the subject and participated in the  <br/>\nclass, but I doubt he&#39;ll go to college. Some may see that as a con. I see  it as <br/>\nwell-thought out at this time. But he knows he could do the  work.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe&#39;s good to his girlfriend and sweet to the animals. He&#39;s gentle and  <br/>\npatient with his little brother. He&#39;s a loyal friend, but seems to stay  away from <br/>\nthe trouble some of them seem to wallow in.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe seems more and more comfortable in his skin every day. Happy with who he  <br/>\nis and what he&#39;s doing. THAT is the best part!<br/>\n <br/>\nThat deschooling thing is hard----it&#39;s really, really hard. He needs to  know <br/>\nyou&#39;re there. He needs to know you care. But he needs to be left to heal. I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t mean just left alone. There&#39;s this incredibly fine line between leaving  <br/>\nhim alone and letting him alone. I don&#39;t know how to explain it. But you&#39;ll <br/>\nknow  it AFTER you&#39;re through it! &lt;G&gt; Go figure!<br/>\n <br/>\nRiding in the car was a great place for us to talk---that&#39;s why we went to  <br/>\nthe beach so much that first year! Duncan would fall asleep in the back seat,  <br/>\nand Cameron and I could talk and talk and talk with no interruptions and  <br/>\nwithout looking at each other (at night with the lights off is good too!).<br/>\n <br/>\nQuit nagging. Offer cool things to do and good movies to watch. Eat out a  <br/>\nlot. Be his partner. Work together. Let him know that you&#39;re willing to let him  <br/>\nheal from that school damage.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt gets better! It gets GREAT!<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":145604420,"authorName":"Luckiebyrd@aol.com","from":"Luckiebyrd@...","profile":"luckiebyrd2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] pros-cons question for Kelly","postDate":"1105150747","msgId":4598,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlOC4zMjBhMzgwYS4yZjEwOWQxYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4600,"prevInTime":4597,"nextInTime":4599,"topicId":4598,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/3/2005 8:03:32 AM Eastern Standard Time, kbcdlovejo@aol.com writes: My  child, at 12 was almost completely turned off to learning.
