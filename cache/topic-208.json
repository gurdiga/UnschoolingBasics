These are BETTER than candy!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI second this!! I also try to always have frozen fruit off all kinds, my kids love frozen blueberrys, raspberries, and blackberries. Won&#39;t eat them very often if they aren&#39;t frozen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I buy a ton of fruit, what ever is on sale that week and cut up and freeze most of it. Then keep plain or vanilla yogurt in the fridge always-maybe a little protien powder and/or other vitimin powders and make smoothies! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe pull out what ever sounds good and pop it in the blender, yum! <br/>\n<br/>\nJaiden calls these are magic breakfast potions. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also don&#39;t think people utalize thee freezers enough. We try to always make extra and freeze in single or small servings that way the kids can grab and pop in the mirowave whatever they hunger for. <br/>\n<br/>\nMuffins are a great thing to keep on hand, make then up yourself and add lots of stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also learned that if the kids are part of whats going on they are way more likely to eat. Jaiden and Avery help us shop-they pick out what they want-they pick what they want to eat, they help prepare it, and if we do have a meal they help plan it. I think it really helps, when they(kids) are removed from the process and have no say in what&#39;s being fed to them it(food) becomes a control issue insted of just food.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Rebecca<br/>\n--<br/>\nYou know, Hobbes, some days even my lucky rocketship underpants don&#39;t help.&quot;<br/>\n-Calvin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":173,"nextTopicId":174}}
