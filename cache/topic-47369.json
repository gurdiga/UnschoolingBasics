Chances are he does, at least some of the time. I&#39;ve seen my kids work for hours, days! to get through part of a game. It can seem like a small thing, but That&#39;s what schools try to instill in kids and generally fail to do - that drive to succeed at one&#39;s goals. Playing video games, your son is learning about priorities - how important Is it, right now, to beat this game? He&#39;s learning about options - cheats or no cheats? Some games even have difficulty settings. Games are made with the assumption that sometimes people like to push themselves even when they Don&#39;t Have To. And playing video games, kids do that. They get to experience the thrill of setting themselves up against a challenge and working it through. Some kids learn that other ways - its not that games are the only way or best way, but they are One way, a very good way, for kids to get to know they have &quot;what it takes&quot; to persevere and be successful on their own terms. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"Debra Rossing &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"scoopmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: I&#39;m freaking out a little.","postDate":"1317399446","msgId":47386,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE2MDREOUJDRjA0MEI0NDA5MjMxQzkyOTg0N0RERUU4MEFEQTVDMzNAVU5JQkxBQi5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47385,"nextInTopic":47387,"prevInTime":47385,"nextInTime":47387,"topicId":47369,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

How&#39;s his cuss grammar? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m be a little silly, but with a point behind it. Learning cuss words is a really fine example of natural learning. Kids very frequently use the words in the right context from observing the ways other people use them. They don&#39;t need lessons in whether &quot;B.S.&quot; is a noun or a verb, they generally spell the words correctly online (barring typos) and the majority of the time they even use the words with the correct sensibilities - a youtube comment, for instance, is a relatively appropriate place to swear. I bet he&#39;d be much less likely to cuss in a facebook update. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re reeling in shock, it&#39;s because your son has had the sense to censor his language in your company. That&#39;s not a terrible thing - time and place make a difference in courtesy, and swearing is generally frowned upon across generational lines. I don&#39;t swear in front of my grandparents, for instance, and in front of parents only if they do it first in the conversation. I don&#39;t think its possible to get to age 13 without learning a bunch of swear words - did you? If so, take a breath.
