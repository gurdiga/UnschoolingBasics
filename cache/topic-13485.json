Just this morning I was<br/>\nreading in &quot;What to Expect the Toddler Years&quot;, a book I only read<br/>\noccasionally since I know that along with some of the good information it<br/>\ncontains a lot of bad advice and information.  Anyway, the part I read dealt<br/>\nwith explaining the facts of life, in light of the recent posts I wanted to<br/>\nshare what it said.  It really explained it in a way I thought was good.<br/>\nThey gave seven points on dealing with the facts of life.  First of all it<br/>\nsaid &quot;Don&#39;t dodge the issue.&quot;  It could make your child feel shameful about<br/>\nmaking babies, or about his curiosity.   Secondly it said to &quot;keep a united<br/>\nfront&quot; make sure that anyone who might be discussing the issue with your<br/>\nchild agree on the approach and use the same terminology.  It also said to<br/>\n&quot;Give it to him straight.&quot;  They reiterated what several of you have said<br/>\nabout shaking his faith in you when he learns the exact truth.  The next<br/>\npoint was to &quot;Use the correct terminology.&quot;  One important point I felt they<br/>\nmade was &quot;to give only as much information as is asked for&quot;.  From the book:<br/>\nIf the child asks where the baby is tell him it&#39;s in the uterus or &quot;womb&quot;<br/>\nnot the tummy.  If she asks how it got there say that &quot;Mommy and Daddy love<br/>\neach other a lot and love you so much, they wanted to make another baby.  So<br/>\nDaddy put his sperm into Mommy.  And that sperm got together with a tiny<br/>\negg, called an ovum, that was inside Mommy all along, and they grew into a<br/>\nbaby.  Explain the biological part of the process only; for now, stay away<br/>\nfrom the sexual aspects.  If she asks how the sperm got there just say<br/>\nthrough the vagina. If she keeps persisting you can explain that Daddy&#39;s<br/>\npenis put his sperm into Mommy&#39;s vagina.  The sperm met the egg and a baby<br/>\nbegan to grow.  And the last point they made was to &quot;Give the child<br/>\nperspective&quot; by showing pictures of when you were pregnant before, and<br/>\nchildren&#39;s books that show a baby growing in the uterus.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I thought this was a good way to explain so I wanted to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13278,"nextTopicId":12991}}
