I LOVE whole wheat bread and hubby doesn&#39;t.  Once <br/>\nmy son got a taste of honey wheat, he began to call that his bread.  For a <br/>\nwhile I have hated giving it to him but now appreciate that this is just his <br/>\ntaste.  I have tried to shape his pallet to no avail and I am grateful that I have <br/>\nhad the willingness to relax and let him be.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n***I was raised on white bread. When I got out on my own I decided that I was <br/>\ngoing to take it upon myself to always try new things....I also decided that <br/>\nI wanted to learn a bit more about my food choices and try to make healthier <br/>\nones. (though I know what&#39;s best, I don&#39;t always choose what&#39;s best for me <br/>\nhowever! &lt;g&gt;) I switched to whole grain breads, 100% whole wheat, whole rye etc. I <br/>\nlove to bake bread and buy my flour and/or wheat berries from a local organic <br/>\nfarm and mill & I have now raised our kids on these breads also. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis talk about bread choices reminded me of a funny story about our kids and <br/>\nbread when they were a bit younger and in school. One day they came home from <br/>\nschool and said &quot;Mom, why do you always *make* us eat the whole wheat kind of <br/>\nbread? Mostly all the other kids at school *get* white bread! Why do we *have <br/>\nto* eat that whole wheat stuff?&quot; I told them, well, you don&#39;t *have to* eat <br/>\nwhole wheat, if you want white, then you can have white. No big deal. I&#39;ll buy <br/>\nsome the next time we go to the store. I packed their lunches with white bread <br/>\nand they came home saying, &quot;Please don&#39;t pack us white bread again! It is <br/>\nGROSS! It&#39;s doughy and sickening! Yuk!&quot; <br/>\n*IF* I had not given them the choice and said to them &quot;Whole wheat is better <br/>\nfor you and I want you to eat whole instead of white, period.&quot; I KNOW they <br/>\nwould have rebelled and NOT wanted the whole grain bread ever. I&#39;m glad I allowed <br/>\nthem that freedom of choice. If they chose to eat white now I would buy it <br/>\nagain...or maybe make it for all of us! We all like the homemade stuff wheat OR <br/>\nwhite! :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Our food issues (was: Help--)","postDate":"1148675139","msgId":13691,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4RUEwRjJBLUExMzMtNDVEQS1BMEUyLTIzMURGQTQ1QjNDMkBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA1MjYxMzA2ZzI4MDczZmMydjllMDVkODM1ZWY5NzQxMjZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGU1MnRpcCtjamhmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MmFhMjRiMDNmOWU3NDlkYWQ0ZmQ2YzIzNmMzMjNlODhAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4gPDAwMTAwMWM2ODBkMSQyOGI5NzIwMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBUb3NoaWJhPiA8QjFGMUYwQTUtM0ZFQS00RTc0LUI5RkUtNkFEMTc0RDNGMTY3QGNveC5uZXQ+IDw2ODViMmYyMDYwNTI2MTMwNmcyODA3M2ZjMnY5ZTA1ZDgzNWVmOTc0MTI2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13690,"nextInTopic":13692,"prevInTime":13690,"nextInTime":13692,"topicId":13676,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It IS cake...look at how much sugar is in it!

Your words have helped me to feel even more comfortable with relaxing my requirements for my children.  My mother offered it all and my brothers and I choose what we want to eat as adults based on our pallets, health and when we want to lose weight.  I have always been more extreme than anyone in my family when it comes to eating healthy.  I have kind of been irritated with my husband&#39;s choices of food because I judge them as not so healthy.  However, I am seeing that the two of us bring balance to our children&#39;s lives.  If it were not for my husband&#39;s taste in bread, for example, I don&#39;t think my son would like bread.  I LOVE whole wheat bread and hubby doesn&#39;t.  Once my son got a taste of honey wheat, he began to call that his bread.  For a while I have hated giving it to him but now appreciate that this is just his taste.  I have tried to shape his pallet to no avail and I am grateful that I have had the willingness to relax and let him be.  Just like I figured out a way to eat that works for me, he is doing the same.  The only difference at this point is I have the weight problem and he doesn&#39;t.  Go figure! :)  Who needs to school who on eating?
