Whether it&#39;s something as relatively &quot;simple&quot; as an aversion to strong smells or as complex as a processing issue where the signals get scrambled somewhere along the way (incoming or outgoing or both), it&#39;s there. The &#39;school&#39; way of dealing with any of it is to use medication as a hammer or saw to make people fit. The bonus, benefit, blessing (pick whichever fits your view) of homeschooling generally and unschooling specifically is that each person is able to grow individually with someone (us parents) alongside to assist with navigating the world and finding those tools (whether it&#39;s a physical technique, medication, therapy, whatever) that are uniquely effective for that individual to address the world in the ways they choose. That might mean, for instance, using only citrus scented cleaners in the house and only &#39;food&#39; scented candles (vanilla, lemongrass, cinnamon) and nothing floral or herbal. It might mean exploring alternative therapies such as Bach flower remedies (Rescue Remedy was a standard item in my purse when DS was younger). It might mean finding a compatible physical therapist (or speech therapist or whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

I think that school has created all these disorders as &#39;ADD&#39; and &#39;Learning disabilities.&#39; They are a symptom of school. Humans naturally learn and discover by moving their bodies freely, talking freely and using the brain freely. Children crave to learn holistically (as the Native Americans did). School doesn&#39;t offer that. In traditional education, it is a very passive and restrictive state; the body sits idle in a chair for hours (one gets reprimanded for even standing up and stretching the legs), the voice remains silent (one gets reprimanded for speaking freely), the brain remains passive and dead to the things that spark your unique interest. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning efficiently is a very active endeavor by the learner. That is the only way true learning goes on. It certainly doesn&#39;t happen by sitting like a motionless puppet all day listening to someone speak on about all the things that are meaningful and important to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would get ADD and all types of learning disabilities too if I was forced to listen to a lecture that didn&#39;t interest me for 6 hrs a day, 5 days a week. The thought officially repulses me!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Thu, 10/13/11, Roger &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rogerrifenburgh@...\">rogerrifenburgh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Roger &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rogerrifenburgh@...\">rogerrifenburgh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] special needs and unschooling<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Thursday, October 13, 2011, 1:51 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      I have been thinking that maybe kids dont always have &#39;special needs&#39; but a repulsion toward traditional institutionalized learning?<br/>\n<br/>\nIve been reading the older posts and it sure sounds like unschooling is not only natural...but actually more &#39;normal&#39; than the one size fits most system of brick and mortar bldgs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277288379,"authorName":"Dawn Hall","from":"Dawn Hall &lt;hallfamily8@...&gt;","profile":"mrshallinohio","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] special needs and unschooling","postDate":"1318531992","msgId":47508,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTnhOU04tbzJ3SG1VZzFXLVA9aFNPTUFBSmFLUG1RaD1pMWJfVDNIQTRuSk42TVpRUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo3NzhmMys5bnNqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo3NzhmMys5bnNqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47507,"nextInTopic":47509,"prevInTime":47507,"nextInTime":47509,"topicId":47507,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think that is sometimes the case.
