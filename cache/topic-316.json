Rather, unschooling should be just one point on a<br/>\ncontinuum of homeschooling, and families should be free to take<br/>\nwhatever parts of it serves their purposes and gets them where they<br/>\nwant to go. That&#39;s what the term meant when we started publishing<br/>\nHome Education Magazine, and it&#39;s what we meant over the years when<br/>\nwe said we unschooled our five (now grown) kids, and it&#39;s what I<br/>\nthink unschooling should be: Not a place you get to, but the journey<br/>\nitself, as just a part of the entire homeschool journey.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ Helen Hegener on the Unschooling 101 e-list ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s a negative quote about unschooling so much as <br/>\nit&#39;s a positive quote about homeschooling.

I <br/>\n&gt;think it must have come when they bought the Unschooling.com name.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ouch. But if we hadn&#39;t bought it someone else would have and they <br/>\nmight have been much less willing to even discuss the situation with <br/>\npeople than we are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to share a little commentary I wrote offlist to someone who <br/>\nasked me some of these same kinds of questions earlier this morning. <br/>\nI apologize for the cut-and-paste shortcut, but as some of you know <br/>\nI&#39;ve been battling carpal tunnel syndrome for years now and with all <br/>\nthe time I&#39;ve spent online this last week it&#39;s starting to flare up <br/>\nagain. Anyway, here&#39;s what I wrote (in part):<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has indeed been a long-running situation, creating confusion and <br/>\nconsternation for literally years now, and in the past I&#39;ve always <br/>\ntried to believe that it was simply rooted in misunderstandings, <br/>\npersonality conflicts, issues of clarity and trying to come to grips <br/>\nwith a very difficult concept. That was - I&#39;ll happily admit - my <br/>\nmistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I posted my post last Sunday, people started pointing out things <br/>\nlike the recurring conflicts always involving [specific people] in <br/>\nsome manner, the banning of people who were causing no problems at <br/>\nall on other lists even when discussing the same concepts (and <br/>\nsometimes even unschooling), the attacks on GWS and the Farengas on <br/>\nour Unschooling boards last summer, the increasing assumption that <br/>\nHEM was something other than an unschooling-oriented magazine, and <br/>\nthe increasing realization that as a distinct definition of <br/>\nunschooling was being created and supported and advanced, the word <br/>\n&#39;homeschooling&#39; was coming to mean school-at-home to many people. <br/>\nAgain, my mistake. I tried to keep the peace when I should have been <br/>\nkeeping the faith.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t expect anyone to &quot;follow my ideals,&quot; or even the &quot;ideals of <br/>\nHEM.&quot; But when people following their own ideals interferes with <br/>\neveryone&#39;s ability to create and follow ideals of their own, then I <br/>\nfeel it&#39;s time to take a principled stand for what I believe is <br/>\nright, which is what I&#39;ve done. The amazing show of support from the <br/>\nlarger homeschooling and unschooling community has shown me that it <br/>\nwas overwhelmingly the right thing to do, and long past due.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1294635,"authorName":"Helen Hegener","from":"Helen Hegener &lt;HEM-Editor@...&gt;","profile":"hemhelen","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] HEM unschooling lists","postDate":"1086554466","msgId":341,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHAwNjAxMDI3NGJjZTkzMGVmM2RkOEBbMTIuMjEuMjA5LjM0XT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGM5djkwNCt1NWVrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGM5djkwNCt1NWVrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":340,"nextInTopic":343,"prevInTime":340,"nextInTime":342,"topicId":316,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
