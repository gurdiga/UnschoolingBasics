It&#39;s very<br/>\nwell written and makes a lot of sense to me. Here&#39;s a paragraph on<br/>\npage 18 that gives the gist of the thesis:<br/>\n<br/>\n    When we consider children in relation to mass media and pop<br/>\nculture, we tend to define them as consumers, watchers, recipients,<br/>\nvictims. But they are also users of that media and culture: they are<br/>\nchoosers, interpreters, shapers, fellow players, participants, and<br/>\nstorytellers. Viewing children as passive recipients of the media&#39;s<br/>\npower puts us at odds with the fantasies they&#39;ve chosen, and thus with<br/>\nthe children themselves. Viewing them as active users enables us to<br/>\nwork with their entertainment - any entertainment - to help them grow.<br/>\nShooter games, gangsta rap, Pokemon all become tools for parents and<br/>\nteachers to help young people feel stronger, calm their fears, and<br/>\nlearn more about themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book is very thought-provoking and jibes with everything we have<br/>\nnoticed about our kids. Manisha remembers the incident when Supriya<br/>\nused the milk-bottle of her doll as a gun. That was when the only gun<br/>\nSupriya knew about was a squirt-gun. So she&#39;d point it at Manisha,<br/>\nmake a shooting motion and ask her, &quot;Did you get wet?&quot; Supriya has<br/>\nrecently been fascinated by Pokemon, but we have not seen much violent<br/>\nfantasy-play from either of the kids.<br/>\n--<br/>\nDaniel<br/>\n(Amy is doing a half marathon for Team in Training<br/>\nAnyone who wants to help can do so by going to:<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.active.com/donate/fundraise/tntgmoAMacint\">http://www.active.com/donate/fundraise/tntgmoAMacint</a> )</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6733,"nextTopicId":6740}}
