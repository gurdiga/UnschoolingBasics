Learning is about helping them reach out to what interests them.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers model responsible behavior, respect and morality. Kids  <br/>\nwhose needs have been respected grow up to respect others needs. Kids  <br/>\nwhose parents have acted responsibly toward them grow up to be  <br/>\nresponsible. For the most part kids will adopt our morals because  <br/>\nthose morals are responsible for the joyful, loving, safe environment  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve grown up in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone makes you act responsible and makes you act respectful and  <br/>\nmakes you adhere to their morals, do you feel more responsible,  <br/>\nrespectful and moral? I feel the need to be the total opposite of  <br/>\nwhat they want from me! I think the only reason parents think making  <br/>\nkids go through the motions eventually leads to real responsibility,  <br/>\netc. is because eventually kids grow up and their view point changes  <br/>\nand they naturally see the value in those. They see value in being  <br/>\nrespectful of those they respect (often conventionally parented kids  <br/>\nrespect their friends more than their parents because their friends  <br/>\nare respectful of them and their parents aren&#39;t (though the parents  <br/>\n*think* they&#39;re being respectful!)). They see the value in putting  <br/>\nforth an effort and being responsible about things *they* care about.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids want to be social creatures. They don&#39;t want to hurt others  <br/>\nwhile in the pursuit of what they want, but they haven&#39;t been on the  <br/>\nplanet long so they don&#39;t have the skills. We help them find better  <br/>\nways to get what they want that doesn&#39;t involve hurting someone. And  <br/>\nwe&#39;re patient with their learning. Just because they&#39;ve been told to  <br/>\nuse words instead of hitting doesn&#39;t mean they can always figure out  <br/>\nhow to get something with just words. Stop the hitting of course!  <br/>\nEveryone deserves to feel safe in their home. But we don&#39;t assume the  <br/>\nchild is being evil or disobedient for hitting. They just need more  <br/>\nhelp. (They often need our presence more so we can be there to notice  <br/>\nneeds before escalation to hitting begins. We can&#39;t stop all of it,  <br/>\nbut it can help eliminate a lot.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have specific questions.
