My son was a 14 year old college student -- he had just turned  14 and <br/>\ntook a class at Harvard Extension, with mostly grad students. He loved  it, <br/>\nand did well. He was the student who participated most in class. For Julian,  <br/>\nit helped him get rid of any school residual feelings about not being smart  <br/>\nenough.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t have to get a GED to do it. There might be a college nearby he  <br/>\ncan take a class, or he could take classes online. Just like there&#39;s no rush,  <br/>\nthere&#39;s also no need to wait if there&#39;s stuff he wants to do. I would strongly  <br/>\nsuggest that he take a class in something he&#39;s really excited about, rather <br/>\nthan  a &quot;101&quot; sort of class. Even if it seems hard at first (Julian&#39;s first <br/>\nclass was  on Darwin and Society, with lots of papers and TONS of reading), it&#39;ll <br/>\ncome  easier than a class that feels boring.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf he has any questions or ideas, he&#39;s welcome to e-mail me or Julian.
