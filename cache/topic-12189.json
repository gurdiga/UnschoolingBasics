We have a friend<br/>\nEmily&#39;s age visiting us from Mobile this weekend.  She&#39;s a delight to have<br/>\n(another unschooler).  Last night I was baking focaccia and making<br/>\nspaghetti.  Our friend walked into my kitchen and said, &quot;Oh, your house<br/>\nsmells like Ren&#39;s!&quot;  I cocked my head not knowing if this was a good thing<br/>\nor a bad thing so asked.  She said, &quot;Oh all the herbs. It smells like Ren&#39;s<br/>\nkitchen when she cooks.&quot;  I found that funny because I always associate tea<br/>\nsmells with Ren&#39;s kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI miss you Ren and your smelly kitchen!<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12088,"nextTopicId":12192}}
