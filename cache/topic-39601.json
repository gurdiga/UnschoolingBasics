Part of it might be that he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s hungry for and so he is suggesting things that seem appealing in theory but in practice aren&#39;t what he had in mind. It may change the dynamics if you are pro-actively offering things than if you are waiting for him to request specific things. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And without fail once you prepare <br/>\n&gt; the item  for him he looks at it and says &quot;I do not want that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Without fail? Every time? I&#39;m not being picky with your words to make you feel bad, but if you can be honest about how frequently something is occuring it will help to minimize the anger you feel building over something. You also wrote &quot;I can not tolerate waste&quot;, but clearly you have been. Not that you shouldn&#39;t be, it&#39;s good that you are letting him waste food. It is much better than making a 4 year old sit and stare at food he requested but didn&#39;t want and eat it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre there other things you can do to make the waste less wasteful feeling? What about a compost or can you get a wormery? I know that worms can&#39;t take everything, but they can take some things that composts can&#39;t. We have a dog and he is very happy at receiving the leavings of others. Our cats like any extra cheese. Bread can be scattered for the birds, and right now for the little moorhen in the pond next to the house. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What is his motivation for asking for things?

I really have no idea! <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would assume his motivation is hunger. It could be boredom, though. I&#39;ve been known to eat when I&#39;m bored. Linnaea has too. You could try and record what else is going on when he asks for food, see if there is a pattern. You could step up your engagement with him and see if it makes a difference in how frequently he requests and then turns down food. I doubt that he is doing it to test you or try you or see what hoops you will jump if and when he asks. And if he were, which I totally don&#39;t believe he is, so what. You get to respond with love and commitment and generosity whatever the intention he has. And it helps a lot if you aren&#39;t supposing that he is working from slightly less than the best intentions.  But I would honestly guess that he&#39;s hungry or thirsty or a bit uncomfortable and thinks that food will help. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re:Food Issues; Waste","postDate":"1239903434","msgId":39606,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NTlFRURBQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":39603,"nextInTopic":39608,"prevInTime":39605,"nextInTime":39607,"topicId":39601,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It could be that he wants your attention focused on him specifically (since there s four of them and only one of you, unless you ve got a couple clones stashed","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1904891909\">It could be that he wants your attention focused on him specifically\r<br/>\n(since there&#39;s four of them and only one of you, unless you&#39;ve got a\r<br/>\ncouple clones stashed your focus is always going to be divided). If\r<br/>\nthere is any way to get him a chunk of your time focused on him (whether\r<br/>\nit&#39;s 20 minutes after dinner when there&#39;s another adult to watch the\r<br/>\nlittlest one and the olders can manage for a short time themselves or\r<br/>\nearly in the morning before the baby wakes or whatever), that may go a\r<br/>\nlong way toward addressing this aspect, if attention is his goal moreso\r<br/>\nthan the food itself.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt could also be that he has a mental image of &#39;burrito&#39; that doesn&#39;t\r<br/>\nmatch what shows up on the plate when you hear &#39;burrito&#39; - asking him to\r<br/>\ndirect you step by step can be helpful...&quot;do you want cheese? White\r<br/>\ncheddar or orange cheddar? Sliced or shredded? Melted or not melted?...&quot;\r<br/>\nyes it takes time; it&#39;s a process. But, in the end, you&#39;re more likely\r<br/>\nto have what he&#39;s asked for (if indeed he was wanting food and not\r<br/>\nsolely the focused attention) so it&#39;s less likely to end up unwanted.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere have also been times when I&#39;ve asked DS (who is now approaching\r<br/>\n11) to please get a glass of water and consider if he is really wanting\r<br/>\nwhat he&#39;s asked for (particularly if it takes significant preparation\r<br/>\nand I know he&#39;s just eaten a goodly amount not too long ago). While he&#39;s\r<br/>\ndoing that, I make sure to keep my focus on him, not go back to whatever\r<br/>\nI was doing. That way, if attention was his goal, he&#39;s got it and if\r<br/>\nhe&#39;s still hungry, he&#39;ll get that, and if he was actually just a bit\r<br/>\nthirsty, he&#39;s satisfied there too. (it&#39;s not uncommon even among adults\r<br/>\nto reach for something to eat when what they&#39;re needing is hydration -\r<br/>\nover time, DS has gotten better at identifying which is which and also\r<br/>\nat keeping a reusable water bottle at hand to stay hydrated).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt may also be a case of being over-hungry. Y&#39;know how when you&#39;re\r<br/>\nreally super overtired it can be hard to sleep? Same can apply to food -\r<br/>\nonce you&#39;re hungry, you want food and you&#39;ll grab any and all food...but\r<br/>\nthe first thing may not really be what you need, so you grab something\r<br/>\nelse and so on... Stopping to clarify &quot;okay, you want a burrito. Let me\r<br/>\ntake your order, sir...would you prefer x or y? would you like m or n\r<br/>\nwith that?&quot; and so on...Often DS and I would do a &#39;decision tree&#39; type\r<br/>\ndiscussion - &quot;you&#39;re hungry. Okay. Would you like something warm or\r<br/>\ncool? Warm. Okay. Soft or crunchy? Soft. Got it. Sweet or more\r<br/>\nsalty-ish? More salty-ish...hmm how about scrambled eggs with cheese?&quot;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnother big issue around that age (3-5) is autonomy - being able to get\r<br/>\nhis own food as well as, perhaps, wanting to be the youngest again where\r<br/>\nmommy provided for him and he didn&#39;t have to be a &#39;big boy&#39; but got\r<br/>\ntaken care of more. It may be the asking that is part of the issue - if\r<br/>\nthere are ways that you can make things readily available (for all the\r<br/>\nkids old enough to eat solid stuff, don&#39;t know how old the littlest is)\r<br/>\nthat might help - set a tray of assorted cut fruits and veggies on a low\r<br/>\nbut safe table (if necessary to keep the youngest from choking hazards),\r<br/>\ninclude crackers, string cheese, favorite cookies, etc. That way they\r<br/>\ncan just get instead of asking every time (that would also potentially\r<br/>\nfree you up from some of the food getting stuff so you have that 20\r<br/>\nminutes per day to spend one on one).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nJust some ideas to mull\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDeb R\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n**********************************************************************\r<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and\r<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they\r<br/>\nare addressed.

I have followed  <br/>\nunschooling principles with all of them with food. If they ask for <br/>\nsomething I  give it to them. They have unlimited access to anything in the house <br/>\nand as we  have all learned kids with no restrictions choose healthful foods <br/>\nfar more often  than unhealthy ones. However I have been having problems with <br/>\nmy four year old  (he is #3 in birth order)  for more than a year and it is <br/>\nreally testing  our relationship. I need feedback and ideas. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe problem I am having is that my four year old is asking for all kinds of <br/>\n things ranging from candy to cereal to burritos or spaghetti, pop, <br/>\nchocolate  milk, bananas, sandwiches etc, etc. And without fail once you prepare <br/>\nthe item  for him he looks at it and says &quot;I do not want that.&quot; I take it back <br/>\nand tell  him to please let me know what he wants when he decides. However <br/>\nI have building  anger. I can not tolerate waste, it makes me feel very <br/>\nupset but eating his food  leftovers is also making me upset. I do not mind <br/>\neating all of his fruits and  vegetables but I have no interest in most of his <br/>\nwaste. I offer it to all the  other children and sometimes they want it and <br/>\nsometimes they do not. I hate  throwing away food but a bowl of cereal <br/>\nsoaking in milk is not going to be  useful to anyone after ten minutes. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat are your thoughts? What is his motivation for asking for things? Does  <br/>\nhe intend to eat them when he requests it or is he just testing me to see <br/>\nif I  will prepare it for him? I really have no idea! <br/>\n <br/>\nHelp! <br/>\n**************Great deals on Dell’s most popular laptops – Starting at <br/>\n$479 <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1220029082x1201385915/aol?redir=http:%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fclk%3B213969145%3B35701480%3Bh)\">http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1220029082x1201385915/aol?redir=http:%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fclk%3B213969145%3B35701480%3Bh)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39626,"nextTopicId":39614}}
