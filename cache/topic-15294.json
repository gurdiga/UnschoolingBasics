I am not<br/>\nsure if I can articulate it very clearly, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child in my home has generally been extremely malleable--- meaning that he<br/>\nresponded well to behavior modification. DH and I were totally<br/>\ncongratulating ourselves at having trained him well. He does as he is told<br/>\non a regular basis with little grumbling. I think he even understands that<br/>\nin our household (the way it has been) that doing as he is told or asked is<br/>\nthe very best way to get exactly what he wants.  But I knew that just wasn&#39;t<br/>\nright!  There was a dark cloud lurking in my subconscious-indeed the very<br/>\none that led me here.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI kept seeing this vague vision of pushing, pushing, pushing and then hoping<br/>\nthat my child makes it to adulthood before all the pushing makes him crack!<br/>\nWorking him like a piece of dough, rolling him out, fortifying him, rolling<br/>\nhim out and hoping I wouldn&#39;t do that one little extra whatever that would<br/>\ncause him to no longer be malleable.  All the time really hating &quot;breaking&quot;<br/>\nhim at all. It all seemed so damn manipulative. (it is!!)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI just knew that as long as the kids are buying what I&#39;m selling, as long as<br/>\nthey believe me, they will respond well to my so-called guidance. But I also<br/>\nquite clearly remember (and harbor to this day) the evil glee and abject<br/>\nterror that I felt when I realized that my parent was not infallible, was<br/>\nnot right most of the time in fact, and that I could *and did* fool that<br/>\nparent on a regular basis. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI was living in dread of the day when my kids would see through me and know<br/>\nthat really, they only have to do what they want to do. And how would I<br/>\ncounter that? Sheer force? Brutality? Benign neglect? I realized that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to control them! I don&#39;t want to impose a set of rules that is<br/>\nsupposed to apply to everything so that they can get by in life. I want them<br/>\nto question, to find the best solution, to be open-minded, to love and<br/>\nrespect themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have known people that grew up &quot;right&quot; i.e. they did what was expected of<br/>\nthem through High School, only to have a major crisis surrounding the fact<br/>\nthat the only truth is that they were always free, or should have been. Then<br/>\nthere were the kids who knew they were free and were labeled problem<br/>\nchildren/teens. These are the kids who on some level see rules as arbitrary,<br/>\nwho see doing anything they don&#39;t want to do as a waste of their time. These<br/>\nideas are not okay in our society for kids or anyone else to have! But y&#39;all<br/>\nknow that. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think I have essentially one of each type of child in my home and<br/>\nI would much rather not ride them until they are broken, not GAMBLE on the<br/>\ntiming of the eventual breakdown that will ensue that will take them out<br/>\nfrom under my control.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I had a better analogy.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt just feels so natural to surrender to their sovereignty and to claim my<br/>\nown and to respect both realities.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI just keep having this vision and lately keep sighing a breath of relief<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t have to gamble on this anymore. I can treat these kids like<br/>\npeople and do my best and assume they are doing their best and fill them up<br/>\nwith love and power instead of breaking them down so that I can control<br/>\nthem!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMary Alice Madaris<br/>\n<br/>\nMother and Facilitator to Elijah and Noah<br/>\n<br/>\nWife and partner to Mike<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15284,"nextTopicId":15286}}
