Sorry for the late<br/>\nnotice - I just found out! It downloads as an Adobe file, which you<br/>\ncan then save on your computer. The whole thing! I&#39;m not a HUGE Suze<br/>\nOrman fan, but I think this will be one of those take what you want,<br/>\nleave the rest things - and the things I take will be very valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the link - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/2ss74m\">http://tinyurl.com/2ss74m</a>   Just click &quot;Women & Money&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nCaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29724,"nextTopicId":29730}}
