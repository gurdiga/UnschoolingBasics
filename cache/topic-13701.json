This is fine with me  because <br/>\nwe always make them together. We use Kefir and frozen bananas as a base,  <br/>\nthen add whatever fruits he wants. I generally add some healthy stuff in then we  <br/>\nwhiz them up together and freeze them.  They are sweet enough from the  <br/>\nfruit, and full of vitamins and bene bacs from the kefir. I don&#39;t mind if he  <br/>\nsubstitutes them for a meal. He has fun making different flavors and then has  fun <br/>\neating &quot;ice cream&quot; for breakfast or whenever.<br/>\nNini<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13043,"nextTopicId":13698}}
