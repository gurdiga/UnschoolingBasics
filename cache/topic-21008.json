We started unschooling a year","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1285618060\">Hello.  I never post here but I&#39;ve been a member for a long time and <br/>\nlurk now and then. I just wanted to respond to this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started unschooling a year ago.  I have a 7 yo, 5 yo and 2 yo <br/>\ntwins.  We had mixed support from our families about homeschooling. <br/>\nI didn&#39;t tell them anything about unschooling.  As the year went by, <br/>\nthey found out one way or another that we are unschooling.  Everyone <br/>\nis baffled by it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started peaceful (nonmanipulative) parenting before my dh did.  <br/>\nFor a while there we had such different approaches to parenting that <br/>\nour kids were confused and everyone was pretty miserable.  One book <br/>\nthat helped was Parent Effectiveness Training by Thomas Gordon.  He <br/>\nexplained the effects of manipulating and controlling kids in a way <br/>\nthat made sense to my dh.  Since then we have gone deeper into <br/>\nmindful parenting.  But that was a good beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as relatives go, I have been tempted to &quot;convince&quot; them or <br/>\nwin them over.  But I had to question my motives.  Yes it would be <br/>\nnice to have everybody treat my children with dignity and trust.  <br/>\nBut that is not where they are.  Nobody has asked for my advice.  No <br/>\none wants it necessarily. (I learned I can clear a room real quick <br/>\njust talking about treating children with more respect!)  I don&#39;t <br/>\nallow anyone to yell at my children or grab them in a disrespectful <br/>\nway. And frankly, I get all stressed out when I try to control <br/>\neverybody else.  I trust my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nForums like this one are great places to connect.  It&#39;s nice to know <br/>\nthere are other families like ours peppered across the country.  An <br/>\nunschooling convention is another great way to meet other families <br/>\nand get support.  We went to Rethinking Education in Dallas last <br/>\nyear because it was the closest to us.  That was a real turning <br/>\npoint for me.  I think unschooling needs peaceful parenting in order <br/>\nto work.  And peaceful parenting needs both parents to be on board <br/>\n(especially if they are in the same house).  But don&#39;t give up on <br/>\nyour dh.  Perhaps if he hears it from a source that makes sense to <br/>\nhim, he can own it.  Then he won&#39;t be doing it just to please you.  <br/>\nMy dh and I have come a long way but we&#39;re still working on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Ds<br/>\n&gt; loves it and I have seen SUCH a difference in dd.&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is the key.
