It<br/>\nis the only way, though, for us to live.  I know that in my heart of<br/>\nhearts.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t make it sting any less when people *seem* to hate you or your<br/>\nchildren.  Just had an encounter today, where a mom (and a friend of mine)<br/>\nsaid to me, VERY EMOTIONALLY, &quot;I don&#39;t appreciate it when S says &quot;i&#39;m going<br/>\nto kill you&quot;, it pisses me off&quot;.  Youch.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I sat with that for the afternoon.  I could see she wouldn&#39;t want<br/>\nsomeone saying that to her child.  I sent her love and understanding.  (and<br/>\nalso kept my mouth shut after she&#39;d said that).  I know my child isn&#39;t going<br/>\nto go off and kill someone, and I&#39;m sure she knows it too, she just jumped<br/>\nright into an old familiar tape.   But I also refuse to start blaming or<br/>\npunishing.  Just not gonna happen.  I&#39;d rather be there to help my kids, and<br/>\n*everyone else&#39;s kids* navigate through their little moments.  Sure does<br/>\nhelp when others come at it the same way, but it doesn&#39;t always happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we&#39;d returned home, she called me.  She apologized for reacting the<br/>\nway she did.  She admitted that there was obviously much more that went on,<br/>\nbut that she just reacted like the mama tiger when her little girl came<br/>\nrunning to her crying.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll is as it should be...<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n&quot;When the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know<br/>\npeace.&quot;<br/>\nJimi Hendrix<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288405080,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"&quot;diana jenner&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] When other parents don&#39;t like your parenting","postDate":"1195516358","msgId":27841,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDcxMTE5MTU1Mm8zZWQ5ZDk4Y2c0ZTk0ODFiNTUwMDI2YWJlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGQyOC4xYTg3MTQ1ZC4zNDcyZmM2M0Bhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGQyOC4xYTg3MTQ1ZC4zNDcyZmM2M0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27824,"nextInTopic":27842,"prevInTime":27840,"nextInTime":27842,"topicId":27809,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
