Abusive marriages suck at any age. In a good<br/>\nmarriage your HB would have tried making it possible for you to go out<br/>\nand have fun one night a week or so, and not expected you to be<br/>\nperfect. That said, did you expect your husband to be perfect?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   I was, like yourself, also raised in a abusive home, where my<br/>\n&gt; mother would fly off the handle and hit me anytime she got upset, or<br/>\n&gt; the verbal abuse would start, this continued all of my growing years.<br/>\n&gt; And like yourself, I too learned to fight with my husband, and I<br/>\n&gt; became verbally abusive to him, as he did to me, it was a mess. To<br/>\n&gt; this day I have no respect for men, and I can be very abusive<br/>\n&gt; verbally if I&#39;m under attack of any kind. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you have no respect for men in particular, or do you not have<br/>\nrespect for anybody? Do you have respect for women? Do you have respect<br/>\nfor yourself? If your disrespect is concentrated on men, why? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So yes having a role model<br/>\n&gt; is very important, and that is why I&#39;m doing my best to be a good<br/>\n&gt; role model for my daughter, but unfortunately, I&#39;m repeating the same<br/>\n&gt; mistakes that my mother did.

If<br/>\nyou work on it, you can eventually learn to not make those mistakes,<br/>\nalthough I&#39;ll admit it&#39;ll be hard and take a long time. On the<br/>\n(hopefully) positive side, are you making the mistakes she made as<br/>\noften as she did, or less often (or heaven forbid, more often)? If less<br/>\noften, give yourself some credit for that. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   I just want to thank you for sharing your story, it&#39;s not always<br/>\n&gt; easy putting your life out there for people to really see who you<br/>\n&gt; are.

Sure, I&#39;m an abuse victim, but just about all abusers are<br/>\nabuse victims, male or female. Anyway, having more or less resolved my<br/>\nissues with abuse makes it a lot easier to talk about it. I&#39;ll admit<br/>\nthat I&#39;ll sometimes still say something abusive, and even occasionally<br/>\nhave a violent thought, but I&#39;m definitely no worse than the average<br/>\nperson anymore. If you care about doing something about your abusive<br/>\ntendencies, there is at least one mailing list out there that deals<br/>\nwith that. It&#39;s usually very inactive, but reading the archives might<br/>\ngive you some material to think about, and if you ask a question,<br/>\nsomeone might respond. I&#39;m not the only female on that list, btw.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/abuse-free/\">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/abuse-free/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the website of the guy that owns the list:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.blainn.com/abuse/index.html\">http://www.blainn.com/abuse/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nA helpful book (although nothing directly to do with abuse) might be:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Handbook-David-Burns/dp/0452281326/sr=8-2/qid=1169680709/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/105-6940443-8373260?ie=UTF8&s=books\">http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Handbook-David-Burns/dp/0452281326/sr=8-2/qid=1169680709/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/105-6940443-8373260?ie=UTF8&s=books</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe cover/title looks like it&#39;s just some slick self-help book, but he<br/>\nactually writes a lot of useful stuff.

They immediately set out for Alaska on horseback and trekked all the way from somewhere in the&quot;lower 48&quot; (cant remember where) up to Alaska. They spent the first winter in an arctic style tent, then proceeded to homestead. They cleared land, hewed logs, built their own log cabin.

I come from a background<br/>\nwhere I was physically and verbally abused, and guess what? When I got<br/>\nmarried, it took me just a few months before I hit my husband... in<br/>\npublic at that. All because he made some comment about my handwriting<br/>\non some stupid form not being legible. I got married reasonably young<br/>\n(20yo), but I don&#39;t think it would have mattered much if I&#39;d waited<br/>\ntill I was 30. Unless you work on certain things, they won&#39;t change. <br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, I&#39;ve worked on the whole abuse thing (and worked on<br/>\nit, and worked on it... it&#39;s hard to change, and abuse victims can get<br/>\nlots of help, but perpetrators who want to quit are pretty much on<br/>\ntheir own). Anyway, the hard work did pay off, and I&#39;m pretty much<br/>\nnever abusive to my husband anymore (verbally or physically). But<br/>\nanyway, the point of my reply was that age probably isn&#39;t as important<br/>\nas other factors. Plus, what really *is* the difference between getting<br/>\nmarried at 17 vs 18? I think it should more depend on the situation<br/>\nthan on the age. That said, I&#39;m with Ren... I don&#39;t see much of reason<br/>\nfor getting married so young (I got married at 20 for immigration<br/>\nreasons, otherwise I&#39;d have done the bf/gf thing living together or so<br/>\nfirst).<br/>\n<br/>\nMarieke<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________________<br/>\nTV dinner still cooling? <br/>\nCheck out &quot;Tonight&#39;s Picks&quot; on Yahoo!

I come from a background<br/>\nwhere I was physically and verbally abused, and guess what? When I got<br/>\nmarried, it took me just a few months before I hit my husband... in<br/>\npublic at that. All because he made some comment about my handwriting<br/>\non some stupid form not being legible. I got married reasonably young<br/>\n(20yo), but I don&#39;t think it would have mattered much if I&#39;d waited<br/>\ntill I was 30. Unless you work on certain things, they won&#39;t change. <br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, I&#39;ve worked on the whole abuse thing (and worked on<br/>\nit, and worked on it... it&#39;s hard to change, and abuse victims can get<br/>\nlots of help, but perpetrators who want to quit are pretty much on<br/>\ntheir own). Anyway, the hard work did pay off, and I&#39;m pretty much<br/>\nnever abusive to my husband anymore (verbally or physically). But<br/>\nanyway, the point of my reply was that age probably isn&#39;t as important<br/>\nas other factors. Plus, what really *is* the difference between getting<br/>\nmarried at 17 vs 18? I think it should more depend on the situation<br/>\nthan on the age. That said, I&#39;m with Ren... I don&#39;t see much of reason<br/>\nfor getting married so young (I got married at 20 for immigration<br/>\nreasons, otherwise I&#39;d have done the bf/gf thing living together or so<br/>\nfirst).<br/>\n<br/>\nMarieke<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTV dinner still cooling? <br/>\nCheck out &quot;Tonight&#39;s Picks&quot; on Yahoo!
