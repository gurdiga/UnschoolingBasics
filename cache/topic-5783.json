He is  <br/>\nalways free to say no.  I say &quot;would you like to help me bring in the  groceries?&quot;  <br/>\nWe are now at a level when I can negotiate a &quot;no&quot; response if  I need to <br/>\n(where he is still free to say no).<br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes he helps alot, sometimes not so much.  Also, my son is  usually <br/>\nmore likely to follow his dad&#39;s lead than mine.  A few years ago,  my DH started <br/>\nhelping my son keep his room clean.  Now my son does it  almost daily without <br/>\nmuch thought.<br/>\n <br/>\nRoutine and structure could also be softened into pattern and  <br/>\npredictability.
