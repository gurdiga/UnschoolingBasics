Talking, reading, even writing (Freely, creatively,<br/>\nnot for a &quot;grammar exercise&quot;) are how to learn to use language. I work<br/>\nwith a bunch of technical writers - professionals in the writing field,<br/>\nthey have degrees in writing, and yet when asked, they rarely even think<br/>\nabout parts of speech or grammar (I asked a couple of them out of<br/>\ncuriosity a while back). Dissecting language into its parts is like<br/>\ndissecting a beautiful ballerina or an amazing running back in football<br/>\nto see how they work. If it&#39;s of interest, great, explore it (some folks<br/>\nlike to dissect things and look at the pieces and how they fit together<br/>\n- they tend toward things like forensic science). Otherwise, there&#39;s<br/>\nreally very little gained in the process except to engender a dislike<br/>\nfor anything that smacks of &quot;language arts&quot; or grammar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d give him a break from all grammar and such for quite a time (like<br/>\nwait until 2010).

Not as a lesson, simply as a fun thing to do while waiting<br/>\n(equal in value to reading, drawing, playing a handheld videogame,<br/>\ncounting Volkswagons going by). Very painless way (unless you make it a<br/>\nlesson) to get a handle on parts of speech. If you can&#39;t help but want<br/>\nto make a lesson of it, don&#39;t do it.

It is great fun and not a chore to read.  My children are also asking to watch a lot of the schoolhouse rocks series Grammer Rocks.  DS was really big in math workbooks also.  Until, that is, word math problems started popping up then he lost interest in them as well because he was not reading well at the time even with me reading them to him.

It might help you to think about what &quot;language arts&quot; are really for: they are the tactics people use to expresses themselves well in specific formats. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are they ways your son likes to communicate? Does he like to talk? Then he&#39;s learning about the art of conversation. That doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s necessarily skillful yet, but one doesn&#39;t need lessons to be skillful. People are motivated by a desire to be understood! Over time he&#39;ll shift his communication style to accomodate his listeners naturally, as his awareness grows, and he has a chance to practice. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s true in writing too. People want to be understood. People **choosing** to write for others will actively look for ways to Be understood. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8yo reads a lot of instructions, so she&#39;s developing a good grasp of what an effective set of instructions look like. That&#39;s a different art from descriptive writing, or writing newspaper articles, or research papers. When my 8yo wants to write some instructions, she thinks about what &quot;works&quot; in the instructions she&#39;s read and uses those tactics. She does something similar when she writes comics - she uses the kind of tactics she&#39;s seen in other comics. In that case, the &quot;grammer&quot; of the medium includes ways to express things in images as well as words. When she wants to write dialog for a story, though, she uses story tactics, which are somewhat different from comics. She&#39;s never been taught to do this, but she&#39;s interested in expressing herself clearly. If nothing else *she* wants to be able to reread her own works and enjoy them without trying to remember what she &quot;meant&quot; when she wrote them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He likes doing the math bookwork, but not much else!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It may also help you to step away from the idea of &quot;subjects&quot; entirely and look at all the things your son is doing in his life. People learn as a byproduct of living. You can put some trust in that and focus on helping your son enjoy his life (and therefore enjoy learning). You could also, if that sounds too scary, actively look for what your guy may be learning from what he&#39;s doing. Not just &quot;subjects&quot; because there&#39;s far more to life than that, just like there&#39;s more to communication than where to put a comma. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void Taintor","from":"Faith Void Taintor &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Language?","postDate":"1259330131","msgId":42222,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI5NDE0MzU4LTMyODMtNDkzQS1CQTAxLTYzQUNBOTQ5QzY0QUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhlbjNkNys3NHNkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhlbjNkNys3NHNkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42221,"nextInTopic":42224,"prevInTime":42221,"nextInTime":42223,"topicId":42217,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sent from my iPhone On Nov 26, 2009, at 6:36 PM, Barbara  ... ***if it is as important as you say, how will he NOT learn it.

They were designed as a cheap way to raise  <br/>\nthe educational level of *the masses*, an overwhelming number of whom  <br/>\nwere immigrant children who couldn&#39;t speak English.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey weren&#39;t designed to provide the best education for each  <br/>\nindividual child.<br/>\n<br/>\nEducators *want* to provide each child with the best education for  <br/>\nthat child, but they&#39;re basically trying to do fine needle work with  <br/>\na hammer. The school system, that looks a lot like a factory when you  <br/>\nstep back from it, isn&#39;t designed to accommodate the needs of  <br/>\nindividuals. They are designed to treat a classroom as uniform raw  <br/>\nmaterial, apply a single process to it (the year&#39;s curriculum), then  <br/>\npass it onto the next factory worker (the next grade&#39;s teacher).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not coincidence schools look like that!

When he&#39;s  <br/>\n12 or 14 or 16 and talking to friends around the world on message  <br/>\nboards, email and IMs, he will know it&#39;s lots easier to understand  <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s meaning when they&#39;re using standard spelling and grammar  <br/>\nand *that&#39;s* why he&#39;ll use it himself, not because he did a bunch of  <br/>\nworkbooks when he was 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I will point out, that unless he&#39;s saying things like &quot;Juice  <br/>\nwants I grape,&quot; then he knows grammar, nouns and verbs.

From the moment he gets up in the morning, to the moment he  <br/>\ngoes to bed at night he&#39;s doing math workbooks?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re viewing the world through a microscope labeled SCHOOL, it&#39;s  <br/>\nonly going to focus on activities that resemble school. Real learning  <br/>\nhappens when kids explore what interests them. Real learning happens  <br/>\nwhen moms are interesting and run things they think are cool through  <br/>\ntheir kids lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t just some squishy rosy theory! Humans (and probably all  <br/>\ncreatures) are designed to learn by freely exploring what we find  <br/>\nintriguing, by trying things out, by exploring all interesting paths  <br/>\n(not just the &quot;right&quot; ones!) to see where they lead. We aren&#39;t  <br/>\ndesigned to memorize someone else&#39;s predigested view of the world  <br/>\n(through textbooks). We&#39;re designed to learn from what&#39;s not working  <br/>\nas well as what&#39;s working, to  pull patterns out of chaos, to  <br/>\nreassess our guesses when the theories aren&#39;t explaining how the  <br/>\nworld works so we can come up with new ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how your son learned to speak. He went from not knowing  <br/>\nlanguage existed to fluency in a few years. He did it without  <br/>\nworkbooks. He did it without a plan. He just used it in whatever way  <br/>\nhe thought might work and got better at it *as a side effect* of  <br/>\nusing it. He learned (without even thinking about it) what worked and  <br/>\nwhat didn&#39;t work through his natural interactions with others.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal learning looks like play. *That&#39;s* how we&#39;re designed to learn.  <br/>\nFree exploration. It quite often looks like cartoons and video games,  <br/>\nespecially in the preteen years as they&#39;re shifting from child  <br/>\ninterests to more adult interests. It looks like Legos and computer  <br/>\ngames and manga and Magic tournaments and cooking and playing with  <br/>\nfriends and soccer and Fibonacci numbers and fart jokes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that last question I asked &quot;And how do you how do you gain  <br/>\nconfidence that it&#39;s as good as school?&quot; is a toughie because as long  <br/>\nas someone is looking for unschooling to give them the same form of  <br/>\ncomfort that schoolish work does, then they&#39;ll miss what unschooling  <br/>\nis best at. What helps is reading and reading about people&#39;s real  <br/>\nlife experiences. It&#39;s the relationships. It&#39;s the kids moving on  <br/>\nseeing a world of possibilities rather than one schoolish path  <br/>\nthey&#39;re locked onto. It&#39;s seeing how kids are learning what they need  <br/>\nfor their lives by living their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":309081207,"authorName":"Beth Williams","from":"Beth Williams &lt;beth.s.williams@...&gt;","profile":"mongoosewilliams","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Language?","postDate":"1259296692","msgId":42224,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZmN2YzYTczMDkxMTI2MjAzOGc3YjIzM2Y4NXFhMDBjY2FiNGFkOTI2M2E5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhlbjNkNys3NHNkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhlbjNkNys3NHNkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42222,"nextInTopic":42226,"prevInTime":42223,"nextInTime":42225,"topicId":42217,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
