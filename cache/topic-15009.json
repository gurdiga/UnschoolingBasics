It has a Google search part, a popup blocker and spellcheck.<br/>\n I also like that when I google something and go to a webpage that was<br/>\nin my search I can highlight the words that I was googling so I can<br/>\nfind it easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently Yahoogroups made a change in the way that messages are sent<br/>\nout.  I had the same problem and found that I needed to go to<br/>\nyahoogroups, sign in, and go to each individual group I am in and<br/>\nclick &quot;edit membership&quot;  Scroll to the bottom and check &quot;traditional&quot;<br/>\nand save changes.  This will stop the messages from coming in &quot;rich<br/>\nformatting.&quot;  Very annoying!  I have the option on my gmail of<br/>\nchanging messages to rich or plain text formatting when I reply to<br/>\nthem.  Your email package may have a similar function that you can use<br/>\nuntil messages start coming in plain text.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209676473,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;oh.kneel@...&gt;","profile":"kc2ark","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Spell check help needed","postDate":"1151451408","msgId":15009,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU3c2ZlZythcW5oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15020,"prevInTime":15008,"nextInTime":15010,"topicId":15009,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am a quick typer easily vulnerable for typo errors.
