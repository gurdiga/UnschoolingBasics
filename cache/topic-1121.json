Even when they&#39;ve <br/>\ngotten the point of separating the two, it is hard to act on that <br/>\nunderstanding and eliminating the school-language stuff from your <br/>\nvocabulary is one way to sort of &quot;force fit&quot; ourselves into an <br/>\nunschooling frame of mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I DO think it is an exercise. I have said, out loud, &quot;Sandra taught <br/>\nme how to braid ribbons into hair. I learned it from her.&quot; If somebody <br/>\nasks me to teach them, I&#39;ll do that. I won&#39;t say, &quot;You can learn it <br/>\nfrom me, but I&#39;m not teaching you.&quot;  That becomes sort of nonsensical <br/>\nto insist on not ever using the word. Context matters. I recommend all <br/>\nthe time to people interested in unschooling that they try to go <br/>\nthrough life without using &quot;schoolish&quot; language to describe what they <br/>\nare doing, for a while. Not using the word &quot;teach&quot; is an exercise for <br/>\nthe purpose of gaining a particular skill - the ability to separate <br/>\nteaching from learning and see them as two different things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] teaching","postDate":"1088419772","msgId":1223,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDEwODg0MTY1NDEuNDBkZmViMWQ4NjMzZEBtYWlsLmV6eW1haWwudXM+"},"prevInTopic":1222,"nextInTopic":1236,"prevInTime":1222,"nextInTime":1224,"topicId":1121,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1049218481\">&lt;&lt;&lt;If they don&#39;t know that, and if they&#39;re still too tightly connected to <br/>\nthinking of learning in a schooling context - and all they hear is, <br/>\n&quot;Unschoolers don&#39;t teach,&quot; then they may, as people sometimes seem wont <br/>\nto do, take this new idea immediately to an extreme and refuse to allow <br/>\nany &quot;teaching&quot; in their homes.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my own journey of deschooling, I avoid the use of the word &quot;teach&quot;<br/>\nbecause although it has civilian meaning, it is also very loaded school<br/>\njargon. I try to use other words like &quot;show&quot;, &quot;explain&quot;, &quot;demonstrate&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;help&quot; that don&#39;t give me a particular status for something specific like<br/>\nhow to draw an S. I embrace the concept of strewing for the broader picture<br/>\nof &quot;What Unschoolers Do&quot; discussions, to show that it is not passive. Of<br/>\ncourse talking about &quot;What Unschoolers Do&quot; could give rise to an erroneous<br/>\npicture of a homogenous group. <br/>\n<br/>\nI find this extra important because Jayn, despite being only 4.5 and never<br/>\nschooled, has somehow managed to become imbued with the schoolish meaning of<br/>\n&quot;Teach&quot; to mean that she didn&#39;t do learn something without the teacher, and<br/>\ngives credit, unduly, to the teacher. One place this has occurred was when<br/>\nshe took a few swimming lessons 2 summers ago that basically were just<br/>\nputting her face in the water and blowing bubbles. The following summer she<br/>\ntaught herself to dog paddle and beginning underwater swimming, being<br/>\ncompletely without floaties before the end of the summer. She did this by<br/>\nplaying, watching me and our neighbors swim, and being allowed to take or<br/>\nleave the floaty vest on her own timetable. However she still gives credit<br/>\nto the swimming teacher for teaching her to swim. :( <br/>\n<br/>\nHumorously, we sometimes are treated to stories of how her friend Googly has<br/>\ntaught her how to do something. Googly is either an imaginary friend or her<br/>\nspirit guide. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;OR they may run from the whole idea of unschooling if they think that it<br/>\nmeans they shouldn&#39;t ever give their children new information or be a part<br/>\nof their learning. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope no one stays here so briefly, that they leave with that impression on<br/>\nthe basis of one thread. If one ever needs a sentence that could be utilized<br/>\nto indicate what Unschooling is not, that certainly is a good one. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

So I just said<br/>\nto her that she didn&#39;t really need a teacher, that she could teach herself<br/>\nanything she wanted to know.  At first she seemed confused about not needing<br/>\na teacher. So I asked her &quot;who talk you to walk?&quot; she said &quot;I did?&quot; and I<br/>\nasked who taught her to talk again she said she did. Then I asked her who<br/>\ntaught her to ride her new big girl bike this year and she said (with pride)<br/>\n&quot;I did&quot; and I said see you teach yourself lots of things!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo last night dh and I went out to see F 9/11 and I was chatting with a<br/>\nwoman who used to be a Montessori teacher in the concession line. When I<br/>\nmentioned we were homeschooling (not even going to say unschooling at this<br/>\npoint) she looked at me and said I was insane and would definitely change my<br/>\nmind by the time grade two rolled along. Didn&#39;t tell her I wasn&#39;t going to<br/>\npay attention to grades.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I was relaying this story to dh over dinner tonight and my dd was there.<br/>\nAnd she said to me &quot;mommy did you tell her I don&#39;t need a teacher, that I<br/>\nteach myself?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then she asked, &quot;how come everyone wants me to go there, I want to stay<br/>\nhome with you!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I was pretty darn proud of that moment, and then all I could come up with<br/>\nfor an answer to her question was that some people thought kids had to go to<br/>\nschool to learn things but we knew better.

It means that the <br/>\nrelationship between the adult and child is just the same as that <br/>\nbetween two adults would be - either one can teach something to the <br/>\nother, one is not the designated &quot;teacher&quot; and the other &quot;the learner.&quot; <br/>\n  If any of you have been in education departments and had to write <br/>\nlearning objectives, etc., you&#39;ll probably know what I mean when I say <br/>\nthat I cringe as much at the term, &quot;the learner&quot; or &quot;will learn&quot; as I <br/>\ndo at &quot;teacher&quot; or &quot;teach.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think it is VERY useful, though, for people new to unschooling to <br/>\nstop thinking in terms of &quot;the learner&quot; or &quot;the teacher&quot; and just <br/>\nstarting thinking in terms of living - drop the vocabulary that is <br/>\ntoo-closely connected to school, at least for a while, because it will <br/>\nliberate your thinking and help you break through some of the remnants <br/>\nof how too-much schooling made us dependent on that particular format.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that it is EXTREMELY useful to talk about how we <br/>\nunschooling parents are NOT turning ourselves into our child&#39;s teacher, <br/>\nas school-at-home parents do. So - pointing that out is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] teaching","postDate":"1088338481","msgId":1167,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEMDQyMEM4LjI4OEMyJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU5LmY0Zjg2MTguMmUwZjVmNTFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":1121,"nextInTopic":1213,"prevInTime":1166,"nextInTime":1168,"topicId":1121,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

What types of problems are they<br/>\nhaving that using the word teaching will clear up for them?<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree there are some people who will read ideas offered as a mandate. And<br/>\nothers will read the exact same words and see the ideas as suggestions to<br/>\ntry out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the subject of learning vs teaching comes up *I* don&#39;t think of it as<br/>\nan exercise. To me the word &quot;exercise&quot; suggests something for someone to do<br/>\nand then set aside because it&#39;s done what it&#39;s designed to do. Like drawing<br/>\nthose lines of springs (supposedly) is a step in learning cursive but not<br/>\nsomething that anyone needs to do after they&#39;ve mastered that.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I think it&#39;s an exercise in *teaching* cursive ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me the ideas offered here are more akin to suggesting a pair of running<br/>\nshoes to someone who is trying to run in street shoes and has asked for help<br/>\nto improve her running. People can&#39;t know exactly what will help a<br/>\nparticular person but they can offer what they sincerely believe will help,<br/>\nwhat they&#39;ve seen help others with similar problems, what they&#39;ve seen make<br/>\nthe side issues (that someone new to it thinks are the main issues) go away.<br/>\n(For instance somene might think their child&#39;s bad attitude towards math<br/>\nlessons is the problem when veteran unschoolers would feel confident<br/>\nsuggesting that it&#39;s the math lessons that&#39;s the real problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing the difference between teaching and learning is something I think<br/>\nwill help someone who is asking an unschooling question that&#39;s tangled up<br/>\nwith schoolish thought get closer to unschooling. (A lot of getting<br/>\nunschooling is making shifts in thinking. Not just new thoughts, but whole<br/>\nnew ways of thinking and viewing the world.) They can try it out. They can<br/>\nask why people think it&#39;s a good idea. They can look at how trying out the<br/>\nidea affects their thinking. And maybe they&#39;ll realize they didn&#39;t have a<br/>\nproblem. And maybe they&#39;ll realize they did.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think for those who don&#39;t have a problem with the word teaching, that<br/>\nit&#39;s polite to recognize that using the word learning instead of teaching<br/>\nwill help with a common problem many people have trying to get to<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what unschooling problems are you trying to help people with by using the<br/>\nword teaching? And is there a way to not set back the people who can be<br/>\nhelped by seeing everything in learning terms and eliminating the word<br/>\nteach?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1421182,"authorName":"marbleface@aol.com","from":"marbleface@...","profile":"nanceconfer","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] teaching","postDate":"1088292177","msgId":1121,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU5LmY0Zjg2MTguMmUwZjVmNTFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1167,"prevInTime":1120,"nextInTime":1122,"topicId":1121,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m sure it can be.
