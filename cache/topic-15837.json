When","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1190719720\">&quot;I was under the impression that [for example] when your children<br/>\nscreamed at you, nothing was said and you just let them go without<br/>\naddressing the issue. When does one childs &quot;freedom&quot; infringe on<br/>\nanother childs&#39; rights or even the parents&#39; rights?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood questions!<br/>\nI personally don&#39;t have any problem defining personal boundaries. If<br/>\nsomeone runs roughshod over me, screams at me or otherwise tries to<br/>\nharm me, I don&#39;t have a problem saying &quot;stop that!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, the age of the person, the situation etc...greatly affects HOW I<br/>\nsay &quot;stop&quot;.  With Jalen, it really helps to get up close to him, touch<br/>\nhim and say something like &quot;if you just talk to me, I can help you<br/>\nbetter&quot;. I don&#39;t always have patience available and I say &quot;STOP<br/>\nscreaming at me, I can&#39;t think!&quot;  He does much better if I can stay<br/>\ncentered and calm...he NEEDS calm.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can address the issue without punishment and without berating. We<br/>\ncan choose instead to view ourselves as their partner in getting all<br/>\nof our needs met and creating non-adversarial situations and solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIgnoring the behavior or situation is just neglect and/or poor<br/>\nparenting in my opinion. If my child is acting destructively to<br/>\nanother persons property or disturbing someone in public, it&#39;s my job<br/>\nto either find a way to distract that child or get the heck out of<br/>\nthere!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we can discuss real situations and specific behavior issues, I can<br/>\ngive better answers, because for each and every situation there will<br/>\nbe a variety of creative ways to deal with it. I can only give general<br/>\nanswers to the question of personal boundaries or &quot;rights&quot; unless you<br/>\nhave a more specific situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the idea of principles vs. rules. Rules to me are set in<br/>\nstone &quot;no jumping on the couch&quot;, rather than living by a principle<br/>\nthat says &quot;respect each others property&quot; that allows us to adapt to<br/>\neach situation but still live by the principle.<br/>\n<br/>\nDanielle wrote a great article about that very topic, and Ben Lovejoy<br/>\nhas also written about it and spoken on this topic several times.<br/>\nMaybe someone can post a link.
