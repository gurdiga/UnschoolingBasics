I have NEVER had an aha moment like the one I had today!<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all for the information and encouragement you provide to us<br/>\nnewbies who are learning how to adjust to the unschooling LIFESTYLE!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGod bless, <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly in FL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36998,"nextTopicId":37009}}
