I can&#39;t tell you how many people have told me how lovely my <br/>\n&gt;DAUGHTER&#39;S hair is.  -sigh-  To a certain extent, I really don&#39;t think <br/>\n&gt;most people would put it together.  At least until he gets older and by <br/>\n&gt;then they&#39;d be so used to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m always amazed at how people just don&#39;t look.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say let him wear his hair long and wear girl&#39;s clothes.  At this age <br/>\nmost people will see a girl.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\nI love mankind, it&#39;s people I can&#39;t stand. --Linus</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":12116257,"authorName":"michele-nappi@webtv.net","from":"michele-nappi@...","profile":"whitelight_2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: transgender/long email","postDate":"1096550442","msgId":3362,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI4MDY2LTQxNUMwODJBLTE2MTNAc3RvcmVmdWxsLTMxNTUuYmF5LndlYnR2Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"dW5zY2hvb2xpbmdiYXNpY3NAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tJ3MgbWVzc2FnZSBvZiAzMCBTZXAgMjAwNAkxMDozNzo1NiAtMDAwMA=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3363,"prevInTime":3361,"nextInTime":3363,"topicId":3362,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have a transgendered foster child who lives with us that we are planning on adopting this spring.

For quite awhile I couldn&#39;t find any<br/>\ninformation pertaining to this subject matter, especially for someone<br/>\nthat is young. He is 8. He has been dressing as a female since he was in<br/>\nkindergarten. He was nicknamed &quot;pinkie&quot; at the time because he wore a<br/>\npink dress, tights, high heels, etc. for Halloween one year. His passion<br/>\nfor female attire, fabric, make-up, etc. is an every day thing. He has<br/>\nmany issues pertaining to 13 placements, remembering and loving his<br/>\nmother and sisters (who were just adopted), abuse of various kinds, etc.<br/>\nHe has therapy at school to assist him in remaining there, therapy for<br/>\nreactive attachment disorder which I attend with him, and now &quot;they&quot;are<br/>\nrequesting that he sees another counselor to assist him in experiencing<br/>\nwho he is around the transgender issues. He did say he would &quot;like to<br/>\nlet it all out.&quot; <br/>\nMy family and are are learning a lot. I unschool my two teenage sons; 13<br/>\nand 16. Many discussions have come up around the issue of transgender.<br/>\nOne friend was totally appalled by our &quot;letting a boy wear a dress.&quot; My<br/>\nkids talked to this young man and helped him see where his thoughts were<br/>\ncoming from. He seems to have relaxed his stance a bit. He is still<br/>\nwelcome in our home and we continue to have discussions. I do have<br/>\nconcerns about my foster sons safety. We have talked to him about this<br/>\nwithout trying to scare him. It still scares him to think someone may<br/>\nwant to injure him one way or another because of the person he is. He<br/>\nsays they should &quot;stick it in their ear.&quot; His world is still young, as<br/>\nhe is. He is learning about prejudices. He now wants to change his name<br/>\nto a feminine one and grow his hair out long. He has asked me many times<br/>\nif he can grow his hair out and wear it to school. He says there is a<br/>\nboy in his class with long hair. I said it was okay. After his adoption<br/>\nI could choose to unschool him too. I believe at that time, he will want<br/>\nto &quot;convert&quot; to female. I own a small shop in my home town. I just<br/>\nopened it two months ago. I could unschool and have him spend his time<br/>\nwith me. He gets hyper though. The shop is getting busier. He will have<br/>\nmany services as he does now. I guess I am writing for support. <br/>\nPeople now say &quot;how lucky he is to have you and your family.&quot; I strongly<br/>\nbelieve we all have the right to be exactly who we are. It feels<br/>\npatronizing to me sometimes when people/therapists/doctors say &quot;wow! is<br/>\nhe lucky&quot; like he is a stray dog that we took in, for lack of a better<br/>\nway to say it at this time. I love dogs, by the way. Do you see what I<br/>\nmean, though? Why would he need to be &quot;lucky?&quot; It is a way of saying<br/>\nthere is something big here that people are not totally comfortable with<br/>\nand are exploring how they feel about it, which is great. No, I don&#39;t<br/>\nfeel totally comfortable with him wanting to be dressed as a female and<br/>\ngo shopping where ever &quot;Walmart, Costco,&quot; etc. I would defend him if<br/>\nanyone said or did anything and I don&#39;t want that energy around him, me<br/>\nand/or my family. When my kids had piercings and various colored<br/>\nhair/green, pink, purple, etc., we got more kind sentiments than unkind,<br/>\nyet the unkind were mixed with threats of physical violence. I enjoy<br/>\ndifference. I enjoy learning about new things. I love discovery. That<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean I haven&#39;t taken the time to work through my own fears<br/>\naround certain subjects. I will always work on myself; creating my<br/>\n&quot;self.&quot; My kids see this and know they have that freedom, too.
