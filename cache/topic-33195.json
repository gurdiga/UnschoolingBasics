This particular bus route has had people quit in screaming rages becaue they can&#39;t &quot;deal&quot; with the kids - my gentler methods seemed to have paid off some  (or else the just got tired of playing with me and moved on :-) ) <br/>\n<br/>\n- for one thing I am much better at tuning out or re-interpreting their &quot;bad&quot; behaviour and interpret the rules a bit more loosely as well - and I joke around with them a lot - anyway, that is kind of irrelevant to the story - <br/>\n<br/>\nthe other day I managed to miss picking up a small child - probably 7 years old - it was all due to a misinterpretation on my part - I had seen the child standing in what I had assumed was his own yard, playing and not in the bus line-up - my brain thought, OK, he&#39;s not going to school, which is not unusual for younger siblings to be out when the others get on the bus in the morning<br/>\n<br/>\n - there are about 20 kids that get on at this particular stop - so I was immediately on to that task, and gave no more thought to that kid - when we pulled up at the school, there was the *very* irate father, just *screaming* at me, in front of his kid - calling me names and claiming I had &quot;closed the door in [the kid&#39;s] face&quot; (although he later said the kid was running toward the bus when I pulled away, so I don&#39;t think it could have been both)- but anyway...I was actually able to remain calm (lots of practice over the years of not immediately reacting to what someone (usually a kid) says to push my buttons) - so I just sat calmly and took it for awhile until he ran out of steam - <br/>\n<br/>\nthen I *tried* to explain to him the situation from my point of view, but there was no way he was interestd in that!  He fimrly believed I had done it on purpose, I guess - and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me greatly if people do things like that to kids if they&#39;re not in the &quot;right place&quot; or whatever, just to &quot;teach then a lesson&quot; - but I would NEVER do such a thing to a child - anyway, it was pretty appalling - and right in front of his kid too - I&#39;m thinking, &quot;great problem solving you&#39;re modelling for your kid there, mister&quot;...anyway, all in all not a nice experience :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nSo good for you guys - people really need to stop being so angry and horrible to each other - just driving seems to make people lose their minds - I agree with Eckhart Tolle in the New Earth when he contends that the human race seems to have, simply, gone insane....<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Debra Rossing <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, May 29, 2008 5:07 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re:RU in every day adult life<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ouch - it really does stand out when you&#39;re at a conference and there&#39;s<br/>\n  all that lovely swirly energy.

DH was in where the speakers were. I<br/>\nhad been doing something and stopped at the front desk to check on<br/>\nsomething. I was waiting off to one side when an older lady stopped at<br/>\nthe desk looking worried. She asked if the hotel had a wheelchair<br/>\navailable. No they didn&#39;t. She didn&#39;t know what to do. Her hubby had<br/>\nbeen doing okay in the pool area but as they were leaving that area, he<br/>\ngot really weak and the walk across the lobby and standing in the<br/>\nelevator would be too much (he had had pneumonia a while back and never<br/>\nfully regained his strength). As I was listening, DS and K came down<br/>\nlooking for me. As the lady turned away to figure out something, I told<br/>\nher that I&#39;d help her out. I handed the tote bag I was carrying to DS.<br/>\nThen K and I went over to where the gentleman was sitting in a chair<br/>\nclosest to the pool door. There were a couple other conference goers in<br/>\nthat area as well (a popular seating, chatting area). I smiled and<br/>\nmentioned that he was one lucky guy to have a whole harem :-) He grinned<br/>\nat that. The easiest thing was to find a way he could get upstairs<br/>\nseated, more difficult would be to each take a side and support him. A<br/>\nquick look around and bingo! The hotel&#39;s &quot;business center&quot; was right<br/>\nthere - they have *wheeled* office chairs with arms! K went and grabbed<br/>\na chair (guess it&#39;s a habit of trying to find workable solutions to<br/>\nsituations with DS). Then we assisted the gentleman to transfer from one<br/>\nchair to the other. I started to push but we quickly realized that going<br/>\nforward ran a risk of catching one of his feet awkwardly. Instead of<br/>\njust turning him around (backward is easier), I stopped and *asked* him<br/>\nif it would be okay to go backwards (same as I&#39;d do if I was changing<br/>\nsomething for DS). He was okay with that and on we went. Into the<br/>\nelevator and up to his room, where his wife got their desk chair from<br/>\nthe room and we transferred him over. They thanked us and he shook DS&#39;<br/>\nhand. Then DS climbed aboard and we took the chair back downstairs<br/>\nagain. Turned out, gentleman and his wife were celebrating their<br/>\nanniversary weekend (20 some years).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

We <br/>\n  don&#39;t have the funds or I would hire a house keeper. Recently I was <br/>\n  hospitalized a few times in a row and my doctor wrote a script to get <br/>\n  my landlord to allow me to have a live in helper, which has been <br/>\n  great, except he didn&#39;t realize that with the kids, keeping the house <br/>\n  and grounds requires more than just a staight 4 hours a day and then <br/>\n  I&#39;m clocking out. But anyway, I went off topic. This RU parent, <br/>\n  during a time of crisis for me, when my 4 year old had wondered down <br/>\n  the runway to pick flowers(for me and we found this out after we <br/>\n  found her) and then decided to explore the forest (we still have no <br/>\n  idea how she got through the barbed wire fencing) and it was dusk so <br/>\n  after running around the whole farm, and seeing my &quot;friend&quot; I asked <br/>\n  her to call the police to help look, and 2 minutes later my dad, who <br/>\n  was visiting called the police too, just to make sure the call was <br/>\n  made. Anyway, after we found her, skipping through the forest next <br/>\n  door without a care in the world, and totally not scared until the <br/>\n  police officer got her, then she was scared and started to cry. But <br/>\n  that part of the story is really just an aside, what really hurt me <br/>\n  was that when the officers were taking reports later, on an official <br/>\n  report she told them that my house was a mess and I never supervise <br/>\n  my children. She told them my 4 year old and 2.5 year old were <br/>\n  outside all the time unsupervised, which never happened. There were <br/>\n  times when I would stay in the screened in porch with our newborn <br/>\n  while he was nursing and watch the two fo them play, SHe probably <br/>\n  couldn&#39;t see me if she was looking from her yard, but I was always <br/>\n  within earshot and I could always see them. When my 4yo got out, my <br/>\n  husband and step mom were in the kitchen talking and I had gone down <br/>\n  the driveway to show my dad where his lost luggage would be dropped <br/>\n  off, leaving the children with my step mom and my husband. They never <br/>\n  even heard the front door open when my daughter left. As someone who <br/>\n  deeply believes in compassion and helping our fellow humans, and <br/>\n  respect, if I had felt that way about a &quot;friend&#39;s&quot; house I would have <br/>\n  asked if they needed help, not reported them to a sheriff who then <br/>\n  has to file a DCF report and include that information. I mean, <br/>\n  there&#39;s always a reason, and our house has never ever been as bad as <br/>\n  the people they always show on the television who have bugs and food <br/>\n  everywhere, it&#39;s cluttered (mostly with toys and my preteen&#39;s random <br/>\n  stuff) but not really dirty. The caseworker who came out unannounced <br/>\n  closed the case immediately, but I still had to go through that <br/>\n  stress which makes the lupus worse. This happened almost a year ago. <br/>\n  I guess the whole point of this long post is, Do other people use the <br/>\n  tenats of respecting others views and differing situations/values in <br/>\n  their lives, or do we just keep this in the family, and if so, how is <br/>\n  that modeling respect and compassion for our kids?<br/>\n  Namaste,<br/>\n  Gen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":27314618,"authorName":"Genevieve","from":"&quot;Genevieve&quot; &lt;katgrl705@...&gt;","profile":"katgrl705","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"RU in every day adult life","postDate":"1211915856","msgId":33195,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcxaG1vZytiYXRsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33200,"prevInTime":33194,"nextInTime":33196,"topicId":33195,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was wondering, how many of us actually take the RU lifestyle and truely apply it to our lives outside of our family.
