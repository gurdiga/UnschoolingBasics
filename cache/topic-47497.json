The two I have been considering are the My First Lab I-Explore Scope which is binocular and can only view 3D objects (no slides) and the My First Lab Duo Scope which is monocular (not sure if that is the right term) and can view slides as well as 3D objects.  My son is almost 5 yrs old so I like the idea of the binocular option as I think it will be much easier for him to see but I have never used a microscope that cannot view slides so I don&#39;t know what to make of that.  Any feedback or other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  We are trying not to spend more than $70 or so.<br/>\nAimee</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47453,"nextTopicId":47494}}
