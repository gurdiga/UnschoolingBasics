I have three <br/>\nkiddos very close in age (9, 8 and 7), and I remember feeling early on <br/>\nthat same sense of disbelief and certainty that folks living win/wins <br/>\nsuccessfully must not have multiple children.<br/>\n<br/>\n----&quot;Obviously, if both want two different things somebody isn&#39;t <br/>\nwining.&quot;----<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s the part that prompted me to jump in.<br/>\n<br/>\nWin/ win problem solving, or problem solving for common preference *is* <br/>\nabout making sure that everyone feels valued every time. Everyone&#39;s <br/>\nneeds in every moment are important enough to be listened to, <br/>\nconsidered, and brainstormed about meeting. During this *process* itself <br/>\nof voicing, listening, considering, brainstorming what often happens is <br/>\nthat the two (or three or four...) needs that were *seemingly* in <br/>\nconflict in the beginning, come round to actually not being so directly <br/>\nconflicting, or they give way to an alternate option that is genuinely <br/>\npreferable but just wasn&#39;t visible as long as the first two options <br/>\nremained in opposition.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe *process* itself of working towards the win/win solution is, in my <br/>\nexperience, the important thing and where both the valuing and the <br/>\ncooperation happen. By engaging in the process itself, people become <br/>\nsuccessful problem-solvers. By engaging in the process, &quot;winning&quot; is no <br/>\nlonger the goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nA practical example off the top of my head...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy two girls share a bedroom, and while most of the time it works great, <br/>\nthere are moments where it generates conflict because they are needing <br/>\nvery different things in the same space. I can recall one time where Em <br/>\nwas needing quiet, private space in her room while Jules was needing a <br/>\nplace to build with her Polly Pockets (or maybe Bratz?). They couldn&#39;t <br/>\nagree and came to me for help finding a solution. I listened to both <br/>\nperspectives, asked some questions to expand upon what they were wanting <br/>\nto do and understand more of the details. We then talked about Em maybe <br/>\ntaking private space in my room, but that didn&#39;t seem preferable to her. <br/>\nWhat about Jules playing in a different space, but no, not preferable <br/>\neither--the conflict really was about the space in that moment and who <br/>\nwould get it. What about Em taking some private time in a nice tub with <br/>\nlavender bubbles and some candles? Yep, that worked with the vision of <br/>\nprivate space that Em was looking for, so she agreed to this solution, <br/>\ngiving Jules the use of the bedroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut...the moment Em agreed that the tub was, indeed, a preferable <br/>\nsolution, the conflict itself melted away and instead of either of them <br/>\nwanting to use the bedroom, they decided that what they both really <br/>\nwanted to do was to play Bratz (or Pollys) in the tub together without <br/>\ncandles and off they went.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we&#39;ve found over and over again in moments like these is that <br/>\nconflict really does give way to common preference or win/ win just by <br/>\nengaging in the *process* itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course there are times the process is clumsy and frustrating and <br/>\nmaybe feels like there will never be a solution. And there are times, as <br/>\nwell, where stop-gap solutions have been made because of practical <br/>\ntime-constraints, but we always come back to the issue and problem solve <br/>\nsuccessfully for a next time. I&#39;m not saying the process is always <br/>\nperfect. But, we have found over the years that the more we do it, the <br/>\nmore often it works, the more it becomes second-nature, and the more <br/>\npeople *trust* that their needs will, indeed, be met. It&#39;s that trust, I <br/>\nthink, that opens people up to considering alternative solutions. When <br/>\nfolks don&#39;t trust that their needs will be met, then they dig in their <br/>\nheals and fight to hold onto their little piece of the pie. The more <br/>\nexperiences people have of their needs being valued and honored and met, <br/>\nthe more willing they are to agree that meeting the need at 2:00 will <br/>\nwork just as well as meeting the need at 1:30 because they can trust <br/>\nthat it *will* be met even if it&#39;s deferred for a little bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat temporal thing hangs people up a lot when considering the idea of <br/>\nwin/ win problem solving--how can someone meet multiple needs *in the <br/>\nsame moment*?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, yeah, of course there will be solutions that aren&#39;t *in the same <br/>\nmoment* because none of us (as far as I know *g*) has figured out how to <br/>\nbe in multiple places at one time. But the process and the trust in the <br/>\noutcome are what, in my experience, have made the *in the same moment* <br/>\nissue really a non-factor most of the time. Well, that, and <br/>\nmaturity--just the developmental ability to wait--has been hugely <br/>\nimportant as well. My kids understand that sometimes win/ win solutions <br/>\nare consecutive rather than simultaneous and that factors into our <br/>\nsolutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess this was all a long-winded way of saying that <br/>\nproblem-solving for win/ wins *is* possible and really does become <br/>\neasier with patience and practice and trust.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (9), Julia (8), Sam (7)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com\">http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\nConnections: ezine of unschooling and mindful parenting<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://connections.organiclearning.org\">http://connections.organiclearning.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":303376347,"authorName":"pastors_online","from":"&quot;pastors_online&quot; &lt;pastors_online@...&gt;","profile":"pastors_online","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: thanks","postDate":"1184282833","msgId":24947,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY3NmRjaCtqMmtsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY3MzhqZCttNW8xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24946,"nextInTopic":24953,"prevInTime":24946,"nextInTime":24948,"topicId":24930,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They said &quot;he needed to know he<br/>\nwas loved&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n     I thought that was weird.   You need to be spanked to know<br/>\nyou are loved???????????  I can understand needing some help<br/>\nwith boundaries, and &quot;discipline&quot; (I don&#39;t like that word).....<br/>\nwhy does it have to be spanking?<br/>\n<br/>\n     OK, I know that people on this list are not going to agree<br/>\neither with spanking.<br/>\n<br/>\n     I have the heart of an unschooler but I have to admit I just<br/>\nhave some limitations.

So school and his feelings about school <br/>\n&gt; and reactions to school are coloring everything he does. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, I seem to need a LOT of time alone, and he and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t like to do the same things (which isn&#39;t wrong or that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unusual but it makes it harder).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It does make it harder - how hard are you willing to work for the <br/>\n&gt; sake of your relationship with your son? That&#39;s not meant to be <br/>\n&gt; either rhetorical or snarky, its something to think about really <br/>\n&gt; hard. There&#39;s a big cultural expectation that our primary job as <br/>\n&gt; parents is to prepare kids for life - and their happiness will, <br/>\n&gt; presumably take care of itself along the way.

That&#39;s a pretty big shift in expectations, and <br/>\n&gt; takes a lot of internal work on the part of the parents. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t share a lot of interests with my stepson, so I have to work <br/>\n&gt; harder to connect with him, to find out about him, to understand <br/>\n </span></blockquote>his <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; likes and dislikes and passions.
