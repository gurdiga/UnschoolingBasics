They don&#39;t *see* damaged doors and <br/>\nhurt kids *right now* - so its easy to disregard your concerns. Here <br/>\nare some ideas for talking and thinking about the various issues <br/>\naround the doors in your home: <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; door slamming can damage the doors and frames<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Having kids around does cause more wear-and-tear on the home, as I <br/>\nsaid before. The more energetic the kid(s) the more wear and tear. <br/>\nPast a certain point, you *can&#39;t* stop that, short of tying the kids <br/>\nup or kicking them out of the house. Active kids use bigger, more <br/>\nforceful motions. If you aren&#39;t used to active kids, its kind of <br/>\nstartling how much Oomph they can put into the littlest gesture. My <br/>\nstepson used to be infamous for hugs that could knock people down ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I live, pretty much everyone slams doors in the summer - darn <br/>\nthings don&#39;t close otherwise, with all the humidity. If you have <br/>\nparticularly dainty doors, it would be a good idea to remove or <br/>\nreplace them, or at least the glass, but by-and-large, doors can <br/>\ntake a Lot of slamming. Heck, I&#39;ve kicked a couple doors open in my <br/>\ntime and even that doesn&#39;t harm them as much as you&#39;d think. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; be dangerous in case<br/>\n&gt; the baby is there with the hand in the wrong place in the wrong<br/>\n&gt; time... <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t talk about this with the kids in terms of the door, but <br/>\nrather in terms of the baby. Chances are, they aren&#39;t interested in <br/>\nactually hurting anyone, they just need a reminder when they&#39;re on <br/>\nthe run to watch out for the littlest. They may also need many <br/>\nreminders when baby is sleeping - they don&#39;t have a baby at home, so <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t used to thinking about one all the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may also be necessary to plan for them to be around when the baby <br/>\nis awake. I don&#39;t know what kind of arrangement you have, but if you <br/>\nwere thinking &quot;oh, I have time for these guys when baby&#39;s asleep&quot; <br/>\nyou might want to reconsider. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the 9 year old kid was running and didn&#39;t stop<br/>\n&gt; himself on the time, by mistake he bumped into the closed glass <br/>\n </span></blockquote>door<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; breaking into the glass causing the shattered glass stabbing him in<br/>\n&gt; the neck. the child died within minutes from blood loss. I have a<br/>\n&gt; glass door in my house.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes kids *do* run smack-dab into things from time to time. Including <br/>\nwindows, lamps and tv sets (and people). You can spend a lot of time <br/>\nand energy saying &quot;no&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;slow down&quot; or you can kid-<br/>\nproof the house a bit more. Different ages take different kinds of <br/>\nkid-proofing. Babies may need outlets covered, toddlers may need <br/>\nbookcases screwed to the walls, older kids may need to have some <br/>\nobstacles removed so they aren&#39;t always running into things. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis sort of shift in thinking about kid-proofing is something that <br/>\nhappens normally as your child ages, but it isn&#39;t intuitive when all <br/>\nof a sudden you have older kids in your home. Its a sort of culture <br/>\nshock.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it an interior door or an exterior door? If the door is inside <br/>\nthe house, consider removing it entirely for awhile, or just leave <br/>\nit open. If its a door to outside, you can ask them to play their <br/>\nchase-games outside *or* inside, if you need to shut out the <br/>\nweather, and discuss it with them in terms of the weather. Its too <br/>\nhot/cold/wet to leave the door open, sorry guys. If the weather <br/>\n*isn&#39;t* an issue, leave the door open and put up a gate for baby.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a baby, it may be that 5, and especially 12 (thats their <br/>\nages, right?), seem really big and old by comparison. Its important <br/>\nto keep in mind just how &quot;young&quot; 5 and 12 are. My stepson will be 14 <br/>\nin a month, and is nearly six feet tall! and I periodically need to <br/>\nremind myself how young 14 really is. Particularly when he&#39;s <br/>\nbouncing around with an abundance of &quot;boyish enthusiasm!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you&#39;re offerring them a whole lot of opportunities to <br/>\nexpress their &quot;boyish enthusiasm&quot; - wonderful! Hopefully some of <br/>\nthese suggestions will help you find ways to continue to do that <br/>\nwith a little less stress on your part, so you don&#39;t end up burning <br/>\nout. You sound like such a caring resource for this other family.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] deschooling an older child","postDate":"1188087039","msgId":25984,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOUI1OENBQjJCQUYzMi0xNDQtNDI5NUBtYmxrLXIzNC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZhZmp0cSttcGlmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZhZmp0cSttcGlmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25974,"nextInTopic":25998,"prevInTime":25983,"nextInTime":25985,"topicId":25929,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Its *possible* to have a tidy home and unschool,  <br/>\nbut its generally more realistic for parents to make their peace <br/>\nwith a higher level of mess in addition to looking for ways to <br/>\nstreamline cleanup. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince mom is working out of her home, this is likely adding to her <br/>\nstress about mess - her home is &quot;on display&quot; so she doesn&#39;t really <br/>\nget a chance to say &quot;oh, its *just* a mess&quot;. Some brainstorming <br/>\nneeds to be done from that direction - how can the family reduce <br/>\nmom&#39;s stress over clients having to wade through kid stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When her kids ate over my house I noticed they had bad habits of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>not<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; picking after themselves, and letting food dropping all over. When <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ask them to clean after themselves they frown and resent it. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Its normal for kids who have been *made* to clean up (or anything <br/>\nelse for that matter) to be somewhat resentful when asked to do so, <br/>\neven nicely. Maybe you can shift your own expectations to that of a <br/>\ncharming and gracious hostess - do you ask your adult friends to <br/>\nclean up after themselves? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your guests are messy people, you can take precautions - <br/>\nplacemats, maybe even a sheet thrown down under the table for easier <br/>\ncleanup. You can rearrange your cleaning habits somewhat so that you <br/>\nwait to do some of your housekeeping until after the messy friends <br/>\nleave. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also plan to have snacks that are deliberately somewhat <br/>\nmessy - that way you are totally in the mindset that &quot;there&#39;s going <br/>\nto be a mess&quot; and are comfortable with it beforehand and can pre-<br/>\nplan cleaning solutions. Its also lots of fun - gooey things to eat <br/>\nwith fingers or lick off plates, foods that are also treasure <br/>\nhunts.... great times. And to top it all off, it gives the kids the <br/>\nmessage that their enjoyment is worth a bit of mess and <br/>\ninconvenience to you. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The mother is very stressfull and feeling overwhelmed. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does mom *want* to unschool or does she feel like &quot;nothing else <br/>\nworked so I guess we&#39;re unschooling?&quot; I&#39;ve heard that now and again -<br/>\n it seems like a really hard place to be, emotionally. I never had <br/>\nto deal with that regarding unschooling per se, but my stepson <br/>\nmoving in didn&#39;t seem like much of a &quot;choice&quot; on our part, at the <br/>\ntime. It was really important for me and my partner to have some <br/>\nvery honest private conversations about frustration and resentment <br/>\nso we could move through those feelings to something more positive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where thinking in terms of relationships (rather than goals, <br/>\nmanners or &quot;education&quot;) is one of the most powerful aspects of <br/>\nunschooling. For the sake of their relationships, mom and dad need <br/>\nto spend more time connecting with the kids. As a friend, you can <br/>\nfocus on your own relationship with the kids as well as looking for <br/>\nways to support mom and dad. When things are stressful at home, you <br/>\ncan be a safe, comfortable place for the kids to decompress a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":314878696,"authorName":"geminimmn_99","from":"&quot;geminimmn_99&quot; &lt;geminimmn.99@...&gt;","profile":"geminimmn_99","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: deschooling an older child","postDate":"1187873013","msgId":25949,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZhanZkbCs3NGdxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZhZmp0cSttcGlmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25948,"nextInTopic":25952,"prevInTime":25948,"nextInTime":25950,"topicId":25929,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am usually a lurker here but this post really stuck out to me.

Sounds like the kid knows *exactly* what he likes to do! <br/>\n*And* he has a strong ability to focus - something he may not have <br/>\nhad a chance to really exercise in school, which expects kids to <br/>\ndrop and change at fairly short intervals (and then people complain <br/>\nabout attention problems, go figure!). <br/>\n<br/>\nAre mom and dad offerring lots of fun things to do? If not, he could <br/>\nbe doing these things as more of a default. That&#39;s worth <br/>\nconsidering. School really erodes kids&#39; ability to self-motivate, so <br/>\nnew unschoolers can sometimes need a lot of help figuring out what <br/>\nthey want to do. School also breaks down communication between kids <br/>\nand adults, so its really important for deschooling parents to make <br/>\nlots of overtures. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (when he is home with his brother they get bored and whine to their<br/>\n&gt; mother I am bored I am bored nonstop)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is there anything I could do to help? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes! Help mom come up with lots and lots of fun stuff for them to <br/>\ndo. If they have different interests, can you take one of them while <br/>\nmom does something with the other? I have a similar age split <br/>\nbetween Mo and Ray and sometimes trying to meet both their interests <br/>\nat the same time can be a challenge. Especially since Ray has no <br/>\ninterest in going places like museums, or anything that seems <br/>\nremotely &quot;educational&quot;.

Having friends <br/>\nwilling to take one of my kids somewhere - or just hang out at home <br/>\nwith one of them while I take the other out - is a real lifesaver. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf mom is interested in unschooling, she might find it helpful to <br/>\nbrowse various sites and boards for discussions of ideas <br/>\nlike &quot;autonomy&quot; and &quot;partnership&quot;. School and conventional parenting <br/>\ntend to favor the idea of &quot;independence&quot; which tends to put a big <br/>\nwedge between parents and kids.

Opportunity, too. That&#39;s a big one. For now, the kids, the older one  <br/>\nespecially, needs to get to know himself before he can find what he loves. And  <br/>\nwhen he DOES find what he loves, he may change that up again, lol! But with <br/>\nthe  opportunity idea, maybe suggest ideas that you&#39;ve seen on TV, anything <br/>\nfrom  animal shows, to science, to the weather channel to the food network (Alton <br/>\n Brown!). Maybe bake with him. Let him knead some dough, choose a flavor of <br/>\nice  cream to make. Collect bugs :) There&#39;s lots to do, but it&#39;s hard to see it <br/>\nwhen  the idea of doing &quot;nothing&quot; is there. Nothing isn&#39;t possible, we are <br/>\nalways  doing something. I know it&#39;s hard to see that at first...really hard. <br/>\nOh, and  music! Find bands he likes, maybe, songs he likes and look them up on <br/>\nthe  computer..oh, there is a lot. And I&#39;m SURE someone else will have some <br/>\nexcellent  ideas and some better ideas...I&#39;m quite new at this! But making the <br/>\nopportunity,  without the demands of having him do it (he still needs to decide <br/>\nfor himself  and no one should be hurt if he doesn&#39;t like the idea, just time <br/>\nfor more  creative solutions). Oh, planting flowers, veggies, stuff like that <br/>\ntoo...<br/>\n <br/>\nIt will all come together, in time. <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] deschooling an older child","postDate":"1187733119","msgId":25930,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUxODA3QkEwLUU2MjktNEY3Ri05MUQ2LTQ0NkM5ODhDREI4NkBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZhZmp0cSttcGlmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZhZmp0cSttcGlmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25929,"nextInTopic":25931,"prevInTime":25929,"nextInTime":25931,"topicId":25929,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My ten year old took 18 months...so I d add another half year or so for a 12 yo to finish deschooling.
