Also super <br/>\nfor snuggling in bed and watching a movie. My daughter uses this for <br/>\nprivate DVD viewing in her own room as well- less expensive and more <br/>\nversatile than a whole separate TV and DVD player.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that this is a new phase of especially not wanting to <br/>\naccommodate her brother - feeling a lack in her own life of fun options <br/>\n- and goes beyond being bored in the car (the car rides are usually <br/>\nshort). She is going through a lack of playmates- one fun friend has <br/>\nbeen away most of the summer and is now is in school- Her <br/>\ncousins(absolute first choice always of playmates) are now busier as the <br/>\nare going back to school and go in and out of being not so kind to her. <br/>\nWe do make a lot of offers for her to try things to meet people- <br/>\nhomeschooled and schooled. Her interests are very specific and she is <br/>\nstarting to be choosier about who she spends time with- so out of kids <br/>\nwho are available she only feels comfortable with a few, and then those <br/>\nfew aren&#39;t always available when she would  like them to be. The school <br/>\nat home families put much less of a priority on play time. This was an <br/>\nongoing thing for my son in the past but now he seems to have formed <br/>\nenough relationships that he has enough fun things to do- the teenagers <br/>\nhave also become more independent of their parents in making plans, <br/>\nwhich works out better. I have been very frustrated in the past in <br/>\ncommunicating with other parents- as their goals are very different than <br/>\nmine. (mine being to facilitate what my kids want to do- their&#39;s being <br/>\nto prevent their kids from doing what they see as a waste of time.)  He <br/>\nis much more likely to find things in common with other kids his age. <br/>\nAnyway- she feels very jealous of his busy social life. She is such a <br/>\ndifferent person and going through a transition. She seems to keep a <br/>\ntally in her mind of who is &quot;getting&quot; more and often the situation seems <br/>\nunfair to her and she feels very angry about it. I do try to make sure <br/>\nshe gets to do what she does want to do as much as possible, but it <br/>\nseems deeper than that and that the actual things don&#39;t really make the <br/>\nfeelings go away. I am finding a balance between providing what things <br/>\nand experiences are needed and allowing her feelings to emerge and be <br/>\nvalidated. It is tricky. Often the anger is directed at me for not doing <br/>\nenough, and doesn&#39;t always seem to be related to how much attention I <br/>\nhave been able to give her. I work at home and she most often prefers to <br/>\nbe doing things on her own but I need to be sensitive to the times when <br/>\nshe does need more of my attention and ideas. Other times offering ideas <br/>\nand wanting to be with her is absolutely not wanted. Finding ways to <br/>\nconnect when she is upset is important- as she usually is angry doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant comfort initially.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n Pamela Sorooshian wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Find ways to enjoy the car time!

You know  <br/>\nhow to handle this - plenty of warning, reminders, and promise of  <br/>\nprotected uninterrupted time later.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. the actual boredom of car time (or waiting time while your son is  <br/>\nat his activity). THIS is much easier - you can listen to Boomerang!  <br/>\nor Jim Weiss cd&#39;s in the car - or other really special wonderful  <br/>\nbooks. Harry Potter, maybe? Make an investment in some really super  <br/>\nenticing books on cd and then only listen in the car. Have a box of  <br/>\ncar stuff for her to play with - special cool stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n(By the way, if you&#39;re listening to books on cd, it can be annoying  <br/>\nto try to keep finding your place - you lose it if someone takes the  <br/>\ncd out of the cd player. But if you put the book on an mp3 player,  <br/>\nthose will usually keep your place in a book even if you listen to  <br/>\nmusic in between. There are some mp3 players - my motorola is one -  <br/>\nthat keeps a lot of bookmarks, so you can have different places  <br/>\nmarked for different people or for different books. You don&#39;t need an  <br/>\nexpensive mp3 player for this.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - you do your best to find a way to satisfy them both (don&#39;t  <br/>\nforget to ask them to come up with their own ideas), and the reality  <br/>\nis that there will be times when your daughter begrudges the need to  <br/>\ngo and times when your son won&#39;t get to go. As they watch and help  <br/>\nyou try to work it all out, they&#39;ll be learning how to find mutually  <br/>\nagreeable solutions and learning to cope when the people around them  <br/>\naren&#39;t able to do so. Both are very important things to learn!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in these days of cell phones, leaving kids alone for a short  <br/>\ntime isn&#39;t as risky as it once was. Just make sure you have your  <br/>\nphone on, the ringer on, the phone isn&#39;t buried in your purse or left  <br/>\nin the car for a few minutes, etc. It can be scary for a kid to  <br/>\ndecide to call and not get an answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sep 14, 2007, at 5:48 AM, hbmccarty wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; When I am faced at one moment with one child who wants a ride<br/>\n&gt; somewhere they really really want to go, and one who really really<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t want to leave the house, I will leave her home.

The issue is that <br/>\nhe has difficulty getting to sleep early enough so that he can get up to <br/>\ndo all the things he wants to do during the day and feel well rested. In <br/>\naddition he really seems to need a lot of sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur house is pretty small- I thought that he could play bass in the <br/>\ngarage- he didn&#39;t really like that idea. I would love for him to have <br/>\nhis own little house next to ours he could have more freedom- but that <br/>\nwould be a longer term solution, due to finances and time constraints.<br/>\nAnyone have anything to suggest that they have done to help a night owl <br/>\nat least somewhat adjust to a little bit of a daytime schedule, or to <br/>\naccommodate different sleeping schedules in a small house? <br/>\n<br/>\nIn general also he really takes on a lot and has a bit of a time crunch <br/>\nwith preparing for lessons and performances, working for money, soccer, <br/>\nand all the other things he really wants to do. I talk about the <br/>\npossibility of cutting back on some things as it is a bit much for me <br/>\nand his sister to drive him to as well as a lot for him to handle, but <br/>\nhe usually doesn&#39;t want to cut back, or not really enough to make a <br/>\ndifference. I have asked him what I can do to help him, the last two <br/>\ndays we have together made up a schedule so that he can fit everything <br/>\nin and not get to the end of the day and feel like he has not <br/>\naccomplished what he set up to accomplish. He is like me, pretty goal <br/>\noriented. I am totally okay with him not getting these things &quot;done&quot; by <br/>\nthe way, but he has commitments, especially with music, to groups and to <br/>\nhimself, which he takes pretty seriously and feels very frustrated when <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t feel prepared. He does go through periods where he will do <br/>\nmuch less. Part of this is that many things are on a school like <br/>\nschedule so they are all clustered together for a few months and then <br/>\nare over. He does somethings at the high school and at the college, or <br/>\nwith people who are on those schedules. I know many families make rules <br/>\nabout how many activities each child can sign up for, but I am not <br/>\nthinking this will work- the kids needs are so different in this respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is much less interested in doing things out of the home, and <br/>\nfeels very angry sometimes that she is asked to come along when all the <br/>\nstops are about her brother. We usually stop for extra treats or to pick <br/>\nup some new beads so that my daughter has something to look forward to <br/>\non our trips out. I have started to leave her home for a little while <br/>\nthough she is only 10 and I am not super comfortable with this- I think <br/>\nshe would be fine in most all situations- she feels comfortable- but I <br/>\nworry about the extreme situation and legal implications. The way the <br/>\nlaw works here, as I understand it from discussions from friends in <br/>\nsocial services, is that there is no absolute age where a child can be <br/>\nleft alone, and that determinations of parental wrong doing are <br/>\ndetermined after the fact by the case workers and courts if a situation <br/>\narises. When I am faced at one moment with one child who wants a ride <br/>\nsomewhere they really really want to go, and one who really really <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to leave the house, I will leave her home. Mostly I will be <br/>\nable to work out another stop for her, but this doesn&#39;t work every <br/>\nsingle time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that solutions will arise from discussions with my family, but <br/>\nthought it would be interesting to see what other people do. We do <br/>\narrange rides with other families, have looked into the bus (not many <br/>\nrunning at the right times of day, usually, though I keep checking in <br/>\neach new situation.)<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks-<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26385,"nextTopicId":26420}}
