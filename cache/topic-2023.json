Thinking about what everyone has been<br/>\nsaying. I can feel that beyond &quot;unschooling&quot; the list is about growth,<br/>\nlearning,etc. in general, as some have said it is. It is a way of life<br/>\nlike spirituality has been for me. The two seem interchangeable in some<br/>\nrespects. To me they are both about thought forms/ideas, the feelings<br/>\nthat come from them, and how we act out these feelings/emote them. It<br/>\nseems for me it is never ending and then I remember spirituality is<br/>\nsimilar to this. That we are here to learn. Learning is on every level<br/>\nand never ending. I can see that I have been drawn to unschooling<br/>\nbecause of my journey thus far. I have always been learning, stepping<br/>\noutside the box, coloring outside the lines, expanding, growing, and<br/>\nlearning. When I first heard about unschooling it scared me just like<br/>\nwhen I first heard about Reiki and then got attunements. When I realized<br/>\nagain that &quot;I&quot; was more than what I had previously thought. It was<br/>\nsomething &quot;different&quot; and thus outside my usual way of thinking,<br/>\nfeeling, doing. When I look back on my life, I see this has always been<br/>\nmy direction. It took a lot of courage on my part. Sometimes we get<br/>\nemotionally injured over our beliefs, sometimes worse. I am reminded how<br/>\nimportant it is to have compassion for myself and others. How as I have<br/>\nevolved, I didn&#39;t &quot;know&quot; and others were at times, frustrated with me,<br/>\nand at times, they acted out these frustrations. I am so grateful for<br/>\nlists like these and the strangers who were the wind beneath my wings<br/>\nthat enabled me to soar and learn. How precious this is. What a gift.<br/>\nMichele<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1998,"nextTopicId":1980}}
