Despite my view of myself as a really attached and connected mother, as a result of this thread I am realizing that I have some work to do.  It is making me realize the importance of really getting into my son&#39;s world and I am seeing how doing so will help me to understand him on a deeper level as well as be even more connected.  I struggle like the other mother with not being interested in what my son is watching on TV.  I am getting to the place where I cannot stand the Disney channel.  Poor fellow, we have never had the Disney channel until recently so I guess he is catching up on lost time.  But, so many of you are saying that so much can come from us participating in these activities, that they branch off into other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also am realizing on this unschooling journey just how different my son and I are.  I am a book person.  I always have been.  At this point, he likes books but he likes TV way more.  I am having to deprogram myself more than my son because I often hear what I have read:  &quot;Read to a child early on and you will have a child who loves to learn.&quot;  I have to make sure that I forget what the &quot;experts&quot; say and just follow the guidance of my son and myself when it comes to how he will learn.  TRUST.  What an important word.

Especially in the beginning.  I learned that my kids needed to know that is was OK to say NO before they could even want to say YES.  If I was really excited and invested in them going somewhere or doing something that would almost be a kiss of death.  But if I was doing something just because I genuinely wanted to and would be doing it even if they chose not to, SOMETIMES, not always, they would become very entusiastic about joining me.   If they thought I was disapproving of tv or video games it would be very difficult for them to want to do other things.<br/>\n  Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n        Secondary school education   Graduate school education   Home school education     Graduate school education online   High school education   Chicago school education <br/>\n    <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!
