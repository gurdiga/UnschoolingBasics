I&#39;ve seen the<br/>\ngood and bad side of animal shows, as I am sure you have, Kelly.<br/>\nThere are people who truly don&#39;t treat their animals with much care<br/>\nand are only concerned with winning (sort of like the icky showbiz<br/>\nmoms).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat have you seen?<br/>\n<br/>\nDogs that hate it are retired immediately and sold as pets. It&#39;s not <br/>\nworth the money to try to finish a dog that doesn&#39;t want to BE there. A <br/>\nshow dog has to LOVE it. He has to be fit and sound physically and <br/>\nmentally. A dog *can&#39;t* win with poor treatment. It&#39;ll show in the <br/>\nattitude or the coat or the gait.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know of bad dog owners, yes. But that&#39;s the *exception* in dog <br/>\nshowing. It&#39;s ridiculously common in the pet world.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=--=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if you aren&#39;t judging your opinion of PETA based on extremist<br/>\nheadlines rather than on what the MAJORITY of PETA members are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe MAJORITY are &quot;Average Joes&quot; with NO knowledge of what PETA is <br/>\nabout. The MAJORITY are the pet-owning public who don&#39;t want bunnies&#39; <br/>\neyes pinned open for toxic testing. The MAJORITY has no idea that PETA <br/>\nwants to do away with &quot;pet ownership.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the big things that PETA is trying to do right now is save the<br/>\nChinese right to have pet dogs.  China is rounding up dogs that they<br/>\nfeel are excessive, large or dangerous (despite whether the dog truly<br/>\nis) and killing them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to a rabies outbreak, the Chinese government killed thousands of <br/>\ndogs. Some dogs may not have had the disease. China is notorious for a <br/>\nlack of HUMAN rights. Dogs can hardly claim MORE than the Chinese <br/>\npeople.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also kill dogs for fur. Sometimes for food.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n PETA is trying to work with the government to<br/>\nhelp people retain their beloved pets.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of these dogs are feral. The government makes little distinction. <br/>\nOur local governments put down thousands of animals each year. I <br/>\nvolunteered at an Air Force Base shelter. WE put down an average of 55 <br/>\nanimals each month.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never joined PETA because I do eat<br/>\nmeat on occasion (there will be no icky tofurky at my dinner table on<br/>\nThursday) and I do wear leather as well sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think ALL PETA members are vegans??? There are thousands upon <br/>\nthousands of PETA members---like your grandma---who just think furs are <br/>\nbad. They don&#39;t KNOW what all&#39;s on the table.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI do try to assure<br/>\nthat the sources for that meat and leather come from more humane<br/>\nplaces such as free range farms and low cruelty killing practices.  I<br/>\nbuy a lot of leather that comes from hunters rather than cow leather<br/>\nwhere I&#39;m not sure of how the animal may have been killed (cruelly?)<br/>\nAnd I live with a hunter who honors the animal that he shoots and does<br/>\nhis best to make sure that as much of the animals is used, making its<br/>\ndeath mean more than just a trophy on his wall (of which we have no<br/>\ntrophies).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have WAY too many anti-PETA issues. You might want to look into the <br/>\norganization some more.<br/>\n<br/>\n=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t judge PETA based on the extremists that are in the news.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle - friend of PETA<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI use to be pro-PETA until what happened to my friend&#39;s whippets. I <br/>\nlearned a LOT about them in a very short time. Luckily I was IN the <br/>\nring with my dogs, or mine would have been targeted too. My van was two <br/>\ncars down from the whippets. I don&#39;t judge based on &quot;extremists in the <br/>\nnews&quot;---I was THERE.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t assume that PETA is not an EXTREME organization.

The big deterrent is to <br/>\nfluff-dry the dog with a forced air dryer. Don&#39;t just towel-dry the dog <br/>\nor allow the dog to &quot;air dry&quot; or to sit and lick himself dry---that <br/>\nonly builds up more dander. Brushing helps---the dander sticks to the <br/>\nbrush. If the brush is cleaned well afterwards, the dander gets washed <br/>\naway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoisturizers and gentle oatmeal shampoos help. So does a good diet. <br/>\nYounger dogs produce less dander than older dogs because of the amount <br/>\nof oil in the coat (fewer flakes AND less licking of dry, itchy skin).<br/>\n<br/>\nALL dogs produce dander.

Poodles, schnauzers, bichon fris (sp?), Cane and Yorkshire<br/>\n&gt;Terriers, shi tzu&#39;s, and Lhaso Apso are all &quot;hair&quot; dogs.  They don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;have an undercoat and therefore don&#39;t shed (also good for keeping the<br/>\n&gt;house cleaner!)  Poodles and schnauzers include the standard to<br/>\n&gt;miniature sizes, so if she was wanting a big dog she could get a<br/>\n&gt;standard poodle or schnauzer.  If she is looking for a medium sized<br/>\n&gt;dog, there are several there and there are quite a few smaller dogs,<br/>\n&gt;which Markus might be more inclined to accept (especially if it isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;much bigger than a rat &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You want to make sure you get a full breed dog and not something like<br/>\n&gt;a peek-a-poo (part pekinese part poodle) because you can&#39;t be assured<br/>\n&gt;of whether they will shed or not.  While getting a dog with a<br/>\n&gt;&quot;pedigree&quot; can be expensive, almost every breed has a &quot;rescue society&quot;<br/>\n&gt;for that breed.  That&#39;s how my parents go their Sheltie.  A friend of<br/>\n&gt;mine got a Golden Retriever through a similar company.  Sometimes you<br/>\n&gt;have to travel a bit to find one close to you, but it can be well<br/>\n&gt;worth it.  Another option is to look to your vet or PETA friendly<br/>\n&gt;animal shelter and let them know you are looking for one of these<br/>\n&gt;breeds.  Most will call you when they find one that needs a good home.<br/>\n&gt;  Sierra may even be able to negotiate herself to one for a lot less by<br/>\n&gt;agreeing to come and play with the puppies and clean up after them and<br/>\n&gt;walk the adult dogs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I found this list (love Google):<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0618517529&id=R9wCs9yQtocC&pg=PA189\">http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0618517529&id=R9wCs9yQtocC&pg=PA189</a><br/>\n&gt;&lpg=PA189&dq=45+best+dogs&sig=HcaK47CLAraKslp-QAD2V_TvYMY<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Which seemed pretty comprehensive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have a friend who has a child who is HIGHLY allregic to animals (and<br/>\n&gt;just about anything) and I only see this lady once a month when we get<br/>\n&gt;together to stamp.  Few people can go to her house as they might track<br/>\n&gt;in animal fur and dander and if you do get an invitation, you have to<br/>\n&gt;leave your coat and shoes outside.  What is weird (at least to me) is<br/>\n&gt;that my friend sends her daughter to public school.  The child has to<br/>\n&gt;take 2 different medication plus an injection *every day* in order to<br/>\n&gt;be able to make it through the school day.  When she gets home she has<br/>\n&gt;to have all her clothes thrown in the washing machine and she has to<br/>\n&gt;shower and wash her hair!  I mean this kid has *serious* allergies.<br/>\n&gt;The mother&#39;s primary reason for public school is (you got it)<br/>\n&gt;socialization!!  ARG!!!!  Anyway, I was surprised when I found out<br/>\n&gt;that they had a poodle.  She said that her daughter has no problems<br/>\n&gt;with poodles at all.  So go for a poodle.

They do shed horribly even though<br/>\nthey have short hair and they do have an undercoat though one wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nthink so.  My parents had a retired greyhound for a while.  ONe of the<br/>\nproblems that people have with retired greyhounds is that they tend to<br/>\nhave health issues.  Why would someone retire a perfectly healthy<br/>\ngreyhound?  It is downplayed by the rescue people and books promoting<br/>\nretired greyhounds, but the more my parents looked into getting a<br/>\nsecond greyhound after Mike died the more they found out that they<br/>\ntend to only live for 2-4 years once adopted (although it does vary)<br/>\nand most have continuing health problems (many with forms of diabetes<br/>\n- which Mike died from after only being with them for 4 months).  They<br/>\nare VERY sweet dogs, my parents just decided that the heartbreak in<br/>\nfalling in love with a dog that would die so shortly after coming to<br/>\nlive with them was too difficult for them.  Our family tends to have<br/>\nanimals for 13-22 years, so 2-4 seemed so short.  A lot of emotional<br/>\nenergy.  Now if you were interested in a greyhound puppy that&#39;s<br/>\nanother story (and expect to have it run as they do love running!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":235225792,"authorName":"Kelly","from":"&quot;Kelly&quot; &lt;kelly@...&gt;","profile":"dogsheeptiger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Sierra&#39;s Dog","postDate":"1164075031","msgId":19145,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDkwMWM3MGQxMiQzOTY3ZTBmMCQwYjAwYThjMEBrZWxseWRlc2s+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVqdG1oYitscWxtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19141,"nextInTopic":19146,"prevInTime":19144,"nextInTime":19146,"topicId":19139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Greyhounds do shed, and they have dander.
