His <br/>\nother friends are more likely to play YuGiOh! with him than Bionicles. <br/>\nThey&#39;re both in the den with me now--just turned on the TV and are <br/>\nwatching Foster&#39;s Home for Imaginary Friends---and are making new <br/>\nBionicles.

It just seems to me families with 2 or 3 or even <br/>\n&gt; 4 kids, their kids seems to be doing so much more. They seems to go <br/>\n&gt; off and occupy each other. It just seems to come across the older <br/>\n&gt; ones are teaching the younger ones and that they&#39;re having fun doing <br/>\n&gt; it. Well, I have to say it is rather boring playing Happy Family <br/>\n&gt; when there&#39;s only the 2 of us, me and 6 yrs old son. Now I even have <br/>\n&gt; to fight with the PS2 for his attention!&quot;!! Son do likes chess, <br/>\n&gt; which is more of his father&#39;s forte but I don&#39;t. I&#39;ve recently <br/>\n&gt; managed to get him interested in The Simpson&#39;s Game of Life. Our <br/>\n&gt; standard weekday routine, outdoor things we do together is go to the <br/>\n&gt; park, Tesco, library, We very much stayed indoors(son&#39;s choice). <br/>\n&gt; When indoors, he mostly occupied himself with his PS2, Lego&#39;s, tv or <br/>\n&gt; surf the net while I&#39;m cleaning or cooking or surfing the net for <br/>\n&gt; more HE info. I&#39;ll  watch tv and play PS2(recent thing) together <br/>\n&gt; with him or simply snuggled up to son with my book. Weekends i tend <br/>\n&gt; to get hubby to take us outdoors maybe to town just for some window <br/>\n&gt; shopping or perhaps just a drive to no where, ending up in some park <br/>\n&gt; or pub for lunch, just to be out of the house. Yesterday we went and <br/>\n&gt; bought ourselves bicycles, so we hoping to be doing some cycling now <br/>\n&gt; that the weather&#39;s beautiful and warm. Somehow, I feel like we&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; not doing enough during the week. But then I have no idea what more <br/>\n&gt; we can do. So my question is <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. If you also only have one child, what&#39;s your homeschooling day to <br/>\n&gt; day like?&quot; Do you have a busy routine or maybe a relax one like mine?<br/>\n&gt; What do you like to do? Where do you go? What do you do? Do you go <br/>\n&gt; seeking for activities Or do you create them? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. What&#39;s driving you? Any goals to aim for? Any pitfalls to avoid?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. Do you have a &#39;only child&#39; syndrome? Mine do as in he&#39;s quite <br/>\n&gt; happy being alone all the time. Though he&#39;ll very happily and <br/>\n&gt; confidently join in any HE group of children to play, it doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; seems to effect him that he have no specific friends in his life. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do write and looking forward to everybody&#39;s stories.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With Best Regrds,<br/>\n&gt; SharonC<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":198023026,"authorName":"caradove","from":"&quot;caradove&quot; &lt;caradove@...&gt;","profile":"caradove","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Help!

We have<br/>\nfive and its actually a challenge to do more. You said you just got<br/>\nbikes. Well we have bikes, two with baby seats on the back but no way<br/>\nto transport five bikes to anywhere safe and nice to ride. Or trying<br/>\nto leave the house and one son hides his shoes because he would rather<br/>\nstay home and play PS2! That was when he was 6yo, sounds like what you<br/>\nare saying.<br/>\nSome children get into one thing at a time and want it ALL the time.<br/>\nBefore PS it was jigsaw puzzles, 500 pc for a five yo, had to be<br/>\nwizards and dragons.It may be just that your son will do the same as<br/>\nmine, one interest to the exclusion of all others.He would play PS2<br/>\nendlessly and could beat really hard games that others much older<br/>\nchildren couldn&#39;t easily do.I think the common theme with his<br/>\ninterests is CHALLENGE! PS2 is a challenge and your son may be feeding<br/>\nthat desire for challenge in the midst of his favourite characters. If<br/>\nyou could go on an adventure with your favourite people, would you<br/>\nwant to stop half way to go shopping?  <br/>\nIsa is nine now, did not read until just a month before 8th birthday.<br/>\nHe announced when he was 6 that he would read when he could read Lord<br/>\nOf The Rings!Lofty idea I thought as he was not reading anything not<br/>\neven easy books.<br/>\nHe loves LOTR and has a hobbit cloak all the hobbit characters and<br/>\nmovies and one hair raising episode where he turned into Gollum in a<br/>\nforest park and went bounding down some flat rocks to a waterfall<br/>\nmuttering &quot;my precious&quot; and there was no way to get him back till he<br/>\ncame out of character! <br/>\n But a few months before he turned 8 he said I think I will read at my<br/>\nnext birthday. And he did, not LOTR but a detour of a large volume<br/>\n&quot;Arthur, High King Of Britain&quot; then everything Arthur, then the Hobbit<br/>\nand then Fellowship of the Rings. He has now also read Harry Potter 1<br/>\nto 4 and all within a year of beginning to read.<br/>\nHe rarely plays PS2 now, only once in a while to help his younger<br/>\nsister, 5.5yo with Dark Cloud 2. Its an AWESOME game, the whole family<br/>\nloves it, me and hubby too. Try it with your son, the storyline has<br/>\ntime travel, the characters are great, and there is battle but no<br/>\nblood, the monster creatures dissolve into blue bubbles and coins!<br/>\nWe would all sit down and watch as Isa played, like a big movie unfolding!<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry and have fun!!<br/>\nCara</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Help!
