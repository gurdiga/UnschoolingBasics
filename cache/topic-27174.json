Maybe your sis knows him? His name is Benzie, Benjamin Zwink, I believe. It would be great to have some contacts she could call if needed. Being a great traveler myself, I also believe it could be a grand adventure if everything checks out. I myself hitchhiked to Alaska with a gay friend when I was 18. It was a great adventure and I have wonderful memories of it. <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n~~What can y&#39;all recommend I do as due diligence to make sure that if <br/>\nshe goes she is safe? alaska is awfully cold in November.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you guarantee she is safe if she stays home?
