DP&#39;s been &quot;in recovery&quot; for a few years, and comes from a<br/>\n&gt;long line of alcoholics. I am not into drinking at all, so between the two<br/>\n&gt;of us we never have it or buy it, or expose our kids to it. Our oldest is<br/>\n&gt;only 6 so I guess we&#39;ve plenty of time to think about it, but I&#39;m wondering<br/>\n&gt;how others have introduced the concept in similar situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My parents were actually great with this.it was always a very matter of fact<br/>\nthat my dad didn&#39;t drink  because he had problems drinking too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I grew older and inquired more, I learned more details about his past,<br/>\nmore serious stuff, history of heroine abuse, ect.but it was always just<br/>\nthere.though not as a scary thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe became sober when I was 3 (don&#39;t remember any of the &quot;before&quot;) and<br/>\nrelapsed when I was 15 for about a year..and then again when I was 24. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut my mother did have wine and stuff in the house, rarely but she did, and<br/>\nit was not taboo.though it was explained, in a very relaxed and non<br/>\nthreatening way, probably around 10 or so.that my several (including dad)<br/>\nimmediate and extended family members did have substance abuse issues, and<br/>\nthat it was not for sure hereditary, but that there were links and that I<br/>\nshould just be *aware* of it.again, not in a scary way, just information.<br/>\nAnd I did drink a tiny little bit of wine, as I got older, at fancy dinners<br/>\nand stuff.but I was just given all of the information..this is just another<br/>\ndrink/ option, and you only have a problem if you do.and if you do, then you<br/>\nget help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo with the younger ones, when/ if they question why other families drink<br/>\nbeer and you guys don&#39;t I would just very straight forward &quot;DP has a hard<br/>\ntime stopping when drinking, so to help, it&#39;s not in the house, and I don&#39;t<br/>\ndrink out of respect for the situation (or whatever it is).but if you&#39;re<br/>\never curious about the taste, we can ask a friend for a sip next time we&#39;re<br/>\naround it&quot; or something like that.whatever works for your family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43936,"nextTopicId":43955}}
