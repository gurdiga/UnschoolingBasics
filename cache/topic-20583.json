Do you worry about the germs and dirt they carry?  Judt <br/>\ncurious  :)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nMy boys have both gone months without a bath, LOL.  It isn&#39;t *sad*  at all.  <br/>\nThey are happy, healthy boys.  My oldest is reaching a point  where his hair <br/>\ngets greasy if he doesn&#39;t bathe more often so he is wanting to  wash his hair <br/>\nmore regularly.  I can say that I don&#39;t worry about the  *germs or dirt* they <br/>\ncarry.  I believe their bodies are used to it, can  handle it.  They are not <br/>\nsick any more than any of their friends, so I  believe they are not picking up <br/>\nany more unmanageable bacteria or viruses than  other children. <br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe their bodies are stronger because they come in contact with more  <br/>\n&quot;dirt&quot; who knows.  But I choose not to live in fear but instead to seek out  the <br/>\nbest information I can from different sources and make informed  decisions.  I <br/>\nencourage my children to do the same, and am more than happy  to help them <br/>\ngather information.  I have so much to say on the &quot;teeth&quot;  issue also but no time <br/>\nto type it all out.  But I think that fear based  decision making in any <br/>\nsituation is not a good thing for me or for my  children.<br/>\n <br/>\nJust a thought,<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20554,"nextTopicId":20584}}
