Y&#39;all are still deschooling. Part of that process is <br/>\nemotional. There&#39;s a certain amount of security when someone else is <br/>\nmaking all the decisions - I remember how scary it was to transition <br/>\nto being self employed. I make the rules? Yikes. Your son needs to <br/>\nfeel that he *can* make decisions about his own life, but doesn&#39;t <br/>\nalways *have* to. Your biggest job in all this is to develop better <br/>\ntwo-way communication with him so you can understand his needs and <br/>\nwants and wishes and help him make decisions that honor those. You <br/>\nmay have to model some of that process for him. You think you want x <br/>\nbut you also like y... can we do/have both? can we try one and then <br/>\nswitch? etc etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the startling things I discovered when my stepson moved into <br/>\nour unschooling home was how uncertain and fragile he was - still is <br/>\nin many ways. At 13, he&#39;s less used to making his own decisions than <br/>\nmy 5yo. It helped me alot, in the first couple months especially, to <br/>\nlet go of any expectations of what &quot;13&quot; should look like and meet <br/>\nRay where he was.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;how do<br/>\n&gt; you all work with piano lessons?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With any kind of lessons, its good to be ready to drop them at any <br/>\ntime. That may be emotionally challenging for *you* if you&#39;ve paid a <br/>\nlot of money up front for them, so if your ds is waffling about <br/>\nwanting to continue lessons you may want to look into a different <br/>\nteacher or progam that lets you pay per lesson, or for only six at a <br/>\ngo instead of 12 or whatever. If he wants to stop, stop. If he wants <br/>\nto take lessons but not practice, don&#39;t make him practice. If he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to do the recital thing, be okay with that. Support him <br/>\nwhere he is and look for solutions that respect his wants and wishes <br/>\n*right now*. Be honest with yourself about your reasons for wanting <br/>\nhim to continue - do you have some picture in your mind of a future, <br/>\nadult him playing piano beautifully? Own that image and separate it <br/>\nfrom the real-life kid you live with. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5.5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":156418579,"authorName":"dana_burdick","from":"&quot;dana_burdick&quot; &lt;DanaBurdick@...&gt;","profile":"dana_burdick","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: New member!","postDate":"1182197398","msgId":24530,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1Nm9xbSsyZjNzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY1NHNhNStxNmU5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24505,"nextInTopic":24566,"prevInTime":24529,"nextInTime":24531,"topicId":24505,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi and welcome to the group. ...

This is simply not true.  Our days are structured by the <br/>\nnatural rhythms of our daily routine and activities we enjoy.  <br/>\nInstead of drawing attention to possessing or not possessing <br/>\nstructure, it might be helpful for you to ask yourself, &quot;What kind of <br/>\nactivities brings us satisfaction?&quot;  You and/or your son&#39;s <br/>\ndissatisfaction with your days will guide you into a set of <br/>\nactivities that you fall into rhythm with.
