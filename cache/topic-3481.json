It seems to be the one thing that most of us stress over the most.  How do you figure that she isn&#39;t where they are?  Is it because she can&#39;t rattle off the multiplication table or is she just not putting 1 and 1 together and getting 2, literally?  There are some great puzzle books and magazines out that have wonderful ways of playing with numbers while not really doing math.  My kids are a whiz with fractions because we use them in cooking all the time.  We have a favorite recipe for cookies that we make each Yule (and now for hurricanes LOL!) that has 2/3, 1/4, 1/8, 1/2, 3/4, and 1/3 of various wholes used in it.  When we make these cookies we are always doubling and tripling the recipe (we would quadruple but I don&#39;t have a bowl that big LOL!)  I&#39;m sure if I were to sit them down with a sheet of math problems they would look at me like I was titched in the head, yet they can figure out how much pepper we need for the cookies if we are making a triple batch of cookies and it calls for 1/8 t.  even when the measuring spoon doesn&#39;t have a 3/8 t. slot (I have sliding measuring spoons).  It&#39;s &quot;fun math&quot; without having to think of it like math.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was at B&N today and was looking at some math puzzle books.  I didn&#39;t get them only for the reason that they have the appearance of math rather than just puzzles.  We subscribe to Puzzle magazine and work on it through the month.  There are lots of fun puzzles in there that make you use that &quot;mathematical&quot; side of your brain without feeling like you are doing math.  Music is another way to stimulate the mathematical parts of your brain.  Just listening to it can help.  Creating it is even better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids just need a bit longer to figure out things than others.  And just because the neighbor kids have been drilled with useless math facts doesn&#39;t mean that they really understand what they are being &quot;taught.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":197929377,"authorName":"Cheyenne Cain","from":"Cheyenne Cain &lt;cherokeecain@...&gt;","profile":"cherokeecain","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"abberavtions and reading","postDate":"1097449117","msgId":3486,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDEwMjI1ODM3LjczMjM0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxNTA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQxNjlBQUNGLjAwMDAwMS4wNDA4NEBDQUxJPg=="},"prevInTopic":3485,"nextInTopic":3489,"prevInTime":3485,"nextInTime":3487,"topicId":3481,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello there.
