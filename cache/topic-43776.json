That&#39;s an idea that works well with a single, relatively easy-going child, but not so well with an intense kid or multiple kids, where sometimes compromise *is* the best solution. The difficulty lies in the process of working toward the solution itself - that very act can become a compromise when you have one child wanting exactly what he or she wants Right Now - a common enough occurance with younger children!<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that the *idea* that everyone&#39;s needs, wants and wishes are equally valid in the moment is one that&#39;s helpful in my life. Its a good thing to keep in mind, even when (or maybe especially when) its not possible to find a perfect solution.  <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294879737,"authorName":"Toby","from":"&quot;Toby&quot; &lt;philipntoby@...&gt;","profile":"philipntoby@sbcglobal.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"TCS vs unschooling","postDate":"1272207363","msgId":43776,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhyMWw2MytrMGRsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43777,"prevInTime":43775,"nextInTime":43777,"topicId":43776,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is anyone familiar with the idea TCS (taking children seriously).
