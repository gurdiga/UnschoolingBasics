But if you think about it,<br/>\nit&#39;s his fault to begin with (and not just because he didn&#39;t use a<br/>\ncondom.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my daughter said &quot;Yeah, because the dad was rude.

I&#39;d love to read a MUCH more positive spin.<br/>\n<br/>\nVicki <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDON&#39;T MESS WITH MOM <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son came home from school one day,<br/>\nwith a smirk upon his face.<br/>\nHe decided he was smart enough,<br/>\nto put me in my place.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Guess what I learned in Civics Two,<br/>\nthat&#39;s taught by Mr. Wright?<br/>\nIt&#39;s all about the laws today,<br/>\nThe &#39;Children&#39;s Bill of Rights.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt says I need not clean my room,<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to cut my hair<br/>\nNo one can tell me what to think,<br/>\nor speak, or what to wear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have freedom from religion,<br/>\nand regardless what you say,<br/>\nI don&#39;t have to bow my head d,<br/>\nand I sure don&#39;t have to pray.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can wear earrings if I want,<br/>\nand pierce my tongue & nose.<br/>\nI can read & watch just what I like,<br/>\nget tattoos from head to toe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you ever spank me,<br/>\nI&#39;ll charge you with a crime.<br/>\nI&#39;ll back up all my charges,<br/>\nwith the marks on my behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t you ever touch me,<br/>\nmy body&#39;s only for my use,<br/>\nnot for your hugs and kisses,<br/>\nthat&#39;s just more child abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t preach about your morals,<br/>\nlike your Mama did to you.<br/>\nThat&#39;s nothing more than mind control,<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s illegal too!<br/>\n<br/>\nMom, I have these children&#39;s rights,<br/>\nso you can&#39;t influence me,<br/>\nor I&#39;ll call Children&#39;s Services Division,<br/>\nbetter known as C.S.D.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course my first instinct was<br/>\nto toss him out the door.<br/>\nBut the chance to teach him a lesson<br/>\nmade me think a little more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mulled it over carefully,<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t let this go.<br/>\nA smile crept upon my face,<br/>\nhe&#39;s messing with a pro.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext day I took him shopping<br/>\nat the local Goodwill Store.<br/>\nI told him, &quot;Pick out all you want,<br/>\nthere&#39;s shirts & pants galore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve called and checked with C.S.D.<br/>\nwho said they didn&#39;t care<br/>\nif I bought you K-Mart shoes<br/>\ninstead of those Nike Airs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve canceled that appointment<br/>\nto take your driver&#39;s test.<br/>\nThe C.S.D. is unconcerned<br/>\nso I&#39;ll decide what&#39;s best.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI said &quot;No time to stop and eat,<br/>\nor pick up stuff to munch.<br/>\nAnd tomorrow you can start to learn<br/>\nto make your own sack lunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust save the raging appetite,<br/>\nand wait till dinner time.<br/>\nWe&#39;re having liver and onions,<br/>\na favorite dish of mine.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe asked &quot;Can I please rent a movie,<br/>\nto watch on my VCR?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Sorry, but I sold your TV,<br/>\nfor new tires on my car.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also rented out your room,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll take the couch instead.<br/>\nThe C.S.D. requires<br/>\njust a roof over your head.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour clothing won&#39;t be trendy now,<br/>\nI&#39;ll choose what we eat. <br/>\nThat allowance that you used to get,<br/>\nwill buy me something neat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m selling off your jet ski,<br/>\ndirt-bike & roller blades.<br/>\nCheck out the &#39;Parents Bill of Rights&#39;,<br/>\nIt&#39;s in effect today!<br/>\n<br/>\nHey hot shot, are you crying,<br/>\nWhy are you on your knees?<br/>\nAre you asking God to help you out,<br/>\ninstead of C.S.D..?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSend to all people that have teenagers or have already raised <br/>\nteenagers, or have children who will soon be teenagers or those who <br/>\nwill be parents someday OR ANYONE WHO&#39;D JUST GET A LAUGH ...I love <br/>\nthis One!!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37739,"nextTopicId":38150}}
