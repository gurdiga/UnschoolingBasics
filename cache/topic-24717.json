But at the last minute, that has fallen through: they are going to <br/>\nhave to be out of town this weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...Duncan and I are looking for somewhere to crash and visit a bit <br/>\nbefore we head to the Minneapolis airport on Saturday to pick Ben up. <br/>\nDunc&#39;s voiced interest in staying at a B&B (He loves &#39;em!) or hotel <br/>\n(gotta love room service! &lt;G&gt;, so all&#39;s not lost if we don&#39;t find a <br/>\nfriendly place to crash. But it would be more fun to find unschoolers <br/>\nto hang with! &lt;G&gt; Wherever we land, we&#39;d like to see some sights while <br/>\nwe&#39;re there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have some space and time for us this Wednesday, Thursday, and/or <br/>\nFriday as we journey north, please contact me off-list.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur route is I-40 to I-75 to I-64 to I-71 to I-65 to I-90. Of coure, <br/>\nthe further along we get, the more time we have to play. The Chicago <br/>\narea would be ideal (a long day&#39;s drive, but doable)---plus there&#39;s so <br/>\nmuch to do and see!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
