Since then, I&#39;ve taken a good look at my issues with controlling<br/>\nmy dd food, and have given her much more freedom than I ever thought I<br/>\nwould.  Last week we went grocery shopping to buy chocolate chips and carob<br/>\nchips.  DD spent the entire hour at the store munching on Carob chips, which<br/>\nshe sometimes would refer to as chocolate even though she knows the<br/>\ndifference.  In the last week she has had nothing but Carob chips for<br/>\nbreakfast 3 times, including this morning.  I&#39;m still working on shedding<br/>\nnegative feelings so I just remind myself that carob chips are high in<br/>\ncalcium and she&#39;s not eating any worse than yogurt or any other high calcium<br/>\nsnack.  Yesterday morning she asked for cookies for breakfast.  DH was home<br/>\nand initially told her that wasn&#39;t a very good breakfast, but after I told<br/>\nhim that actually they (the brand of cookies we buy that she eats) had about<br/>\nthe same if not less sugar, and was fortified with more vitamins/minerals<br/>\nthan some of the cereal she eats he was all for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, what I was actually intending in this post was to say, like whomever<br/>\nmentioned the &quot;junk&quot; issue...

She too loves popsicles, but we make them together using fruit<br/>\nthat&#39;s getting to ripe.  We just pop watermelon or honeydew, oranges,<br/>\nblueberries whatever in the food processor and pour them into popsicle<br/>\nmolds.  We all enjoy eating them in the hot afternoon.  We do the same to<br/>\nmake frozen ice cream type treat, we just add frozen sliced bananas each<br/>\ntime to make it creamy.
