If you can build a better<br/>\n&gt; relationship between yourself and your husband, if you can  <br/>\n&gt; understand his<br/>\n&gt; point of view and motivations, I think you&#39;ll be better able to help  <br/>\n&gt; him<br/>\n&gt; build good relationships with your children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can&#39;t change your husband. You already know that. But you can  <br/>\n&gt; consider<br/>\n&gt; why he is the way he is. In some peaceful moment you might talk with  <br/>\n&gt; him<br/>\n&gt; about his childhood and tell him you&#39;re sorry that he didn&#39;t have  <br/>\n&gt; the kind<br/>\n&gt; of childhood he ought to have had. If you can find a way to express  <br/>\n&gt; it,<br/>\n&gt; suggest he turned out well because of his own good character, not  <br/>\n&gt; because of<br/>\n&gt; his hardships, but in spite of them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra Dodd has written about something she called &quot;re-parenting.&quot; I<br/>\n&gt; believe the idea came from meetings of Adult Children of Alcoholics.  <br/>\n&gt; It is<br/>\n&gt; a practice for healing. In AA the members become parents to a Teddy  <br/>\n&gt; bear<br/>\n&gt; and &quot;parent&quot; it the way they wish they had been parented. Sandra has<br/>\n&gt; written about the healing that can come from being kinder to our  <br/>\n&gt; children<br/>\n&gt; than our parents were with us. Maybe, if you can find an appropriate  <br/>\n&gt; time,<br/>\n&gt; you could talk with your husband about the idea. If he remembers how  <br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; felt as a child, he might find some comfort in making sure his  <br/>\n&gt; children have<br/>\n&gt; a happier life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have noticed that many men with this kind of work ethic seem to  <br/>\n&gt; need the<br/>\n&gt; approval of others. Offer him more thanks for taking care of his  <br/>\n&gt; family,<br/>\n&gt; offer more praise for the work he does. People who feel they are<br/>\n&gt; appreciated are usually kinder and more patient with others. This is  <br/>\n&gt; part<br/>\n&gt; of the concept of filling a person up emotionally.<br/>\n&gt; The more appreciative, kind, generous we are with others, the more  <br/>\n&gt; of that<br/>\n&gt; they have to give to others. Help your husband feel full of love.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, in a peaceful moment, talk about how you feel toward your  <br/>\n&gt; children.<br/>\n&gt; Mom&#39;s have a special connection with their children. Our children grow<br/>\n&gt; inside us, they are nurtured from our bodies and that bond is  <br/>\n&gt; powerful.<br/>\n&gt; Remind your husband that it is natural for you to feel strongly  <br/>\n&gt; about the<br/>\n&gt; emotional well being of your children and that you wouldn&#39;t be much  <br/>\n&gt; of a<br/>\n&gt; mother if you weren&#39;t thinking of these things. Ask him to be  <br/>\n&gt; patient with<br/>\n&gt; you when his ideas and your ideas clash. This might help him feel less<br/>\n&gt; like you&#39;re criticizing him and more like you&#39;re mothering your  <br/>\n&gt; children.<br/>\n&gt; But be careful not to suggest the children need you to protect them  <br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; him. Make it about you, about your nature and not about your husband.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe a small difference but I think it can help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your son is old enough to understand some things about his dad and  <br/>\n&gt; maybe you<br/>\n&gt; can talk with him. Be careful not to talk against his dad. But maybe<br/>\n&gt; talk about your husband&#39;s childhood and how it is that people come to<br/>\n&gt; justify unpleasant things because they are powerless to change them.  <br/>\n&gt; Help<br/>\n&gt; your son understand his dad loves him and that you are trying to  <br/>\n&gt; work for a<br/>\n&gt; really happy, peaceful home life - and sometimes that might look  <br/>\n&gt; like doing<br/>\n&gt; things to help your husband feel better, doing chores, etc. Let your  <br/>\n&gt; son<br/>\n&gt; know if his dad assigns chores you will help him get them done.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This isn&#39;t anything that&#39;s likely to change in a hurry. But if it  <br/>\n&gt; helps<br/>\n&gt; you, many unschooling moms have husbands who were not fully onboard  <br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; unschooling and who didn&#39;t really understand these pretty radical  <br/>\n&gt; parenting<br/>\n&gt; ideas. It can work out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Understanding that we can&#39;t change others does not mean we can&#39;t share<br/>\n&gt; information and ideas.<br/>\n&gt; Will your husband read brief articles? There are bits at Sandra Dodd&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; website about the benefits of video games. If your husband sees  <br/>\n&gt; games as a<br/>\n&gt; waste of time maybe reading about kids whose interest in video games  <br/>\n&gt; led to<br/>\n&gt; jobs in computers or software would give him a different perspective.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe you could print an article now and then and offer it in the  <br/>\n&gt; way you&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; share anything else you found interesting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are links to follow here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/videogames/\">http://sandradodd.com/videogames/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are some blurbs about chores here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/chores/\">http://sandradodd.com/chores/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s website has a lot about video games and chores  <br/>\n&gt; (and money)<br/>\n&gt; : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe you can ease some of your husband&#39;s worries about the kids  <br/>\n&gt; spending<br/>\n&gt; money by pointing out the best way for kids to learn is by getting the<br/>\n&gt; opportunity to use money and make spending decisions. Maybe list  <br/>\n&gt; members<br/>\n&gt; can offer their stories about kids and money.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or you can take the responsibility. Don&#39;t say, &quot;Romeo bought a game&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; say,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I bought a game for Romeo, a gift&quot; and then if your husband needs to<br/>\n&gt; express his concern, he can express it to you instead of your child.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ***Well, it&#39;s 4:05 am and they are still not here! I am so pissed  <br/>\n&gt; off with<br/>\n&gt; him.***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That *is* troubling. I would probably have gone there and picked up my<br/>\n&gt; kid. But that does depend on the kid. Some kids might have thought  <br/>\n&gt; it was<br/>\n&gt; kind of cool to be up in the middle of the night. But if my kid was<br/>\n&gt; unhappy, I&#39;d have gone to get him. Maybe you were without a car or<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t leave other children. I understand your distress over this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ***...his dad said the money he could&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; used for the game, he could&#39;ve bought food instead.***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My heart hurt for your son *and* your husband when I read that. Your<br/>\n&gt; husband must have heard it often.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have played a kind of game here about what money could have bought<br/>\n&gt; instead of what we chose. The money we spent on our computer (not a  <br/>\n&gt; great<br/>\n&gt; example, it&#39;s ten years old, but when it was new) could have bought a<br/>\n&gt; reliable used car for some needy, car-less family. It&#39;s interesting to<br/>\n&gt; consider our choices. Though your husband made it feel like guilt, you<br/>\n&gt; might ease your son&#39;s concerns by playing a game about what the  <br/>\n&gt; money you<br/>\n&gt; spent on a toaster or blender or coffee pot (or other household  <br/>\n&gt; things)<br/>\n&gt; might have bought instead. Food for animals in the animal shelter. A<br/>\n&gt; hearing aid for an old person. Some really cool toys. Two more video  <br/>\n&gt; games!<br/>\n&gt; Consider the possibilities, talk about all the different reasons we  <br/>\n&gt; make the<br/>\n&gt; choices we make, and maybe if it comes up again between them, your  <br/>\n&gt; son will<br/>\n&gt; be able to consider it philosophically, without it hurting his  <br/>\n&gt; feelings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Deb Lewis<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"d.lewis","from":"&quot;d.lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: What should I do about this situation?","postDate":"1269190343","msgId":43443,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERCQ0M5NjgxQTZGMDQwQTdBMTY5NTc3NUNBQkM1NDBFQGRlYm9yYWg3NmE3OWh2Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDVCNDMwRTA2RDQzQTRGMEFCMzMwMjQxNDhEQTc2MkUzQGRlYm9yYWg3NmE3OWh2Pg=="},"prevInTopic":43441,"nextInTopic":43447,"prevInTime":43442,"nextInTime":43444,"topicId":43401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Another link to a potentially helpful list:  This one about unschooling partnerships: http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingpartnerships/ Deb Lewis","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-987955633\">Another link to a potentially helpful list:  This one about unschooling <br/>\npartnerships:<br/>\n<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingpartnerships/\">http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingpartnerships/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"d.lewis","from":"&quot;d.lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"1"},"subject":"Re: What should I do about this situation?","postDate":"1269189047","msgId":43441,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVCNDMwRTA2RDQzQTRGMEFCMzMwMjQxNDhEQTc2MkUzQGRlYm9yYWg3NmE3OWh2Pg=="},"prevInTopic":43405,"nextInTopic":43443,"prevInTime":43440,"nextInTime":43442,"topicId":43401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***My husband came from a poor family that didn t have tv and video games.

I understand your distress over this.<br/>\n<br/>\n***...his dad said the money he could&#39;ve<br/>\nused for the game, he could&#39;ve bought food instead.***<br/>\n<br/>\nMy heart hurt for your son *and* your husband when I read that.  Your <br/>\nhusband must have heard it often.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have played a kind of game here about what money could have bought <br/>\ninstead of what we chose.  The money we spent on our computer (not a great <br/>\nexample, it&#39;s ten years old, but when it was new) could have bought a <br/>\nreliable used car for some needy, car-less family.   It&#39;s interesting to <br/>\nconsider our choices.  Though your husband made it feel like guilt, you <br/>\nmight ease your son&#39;s concerns by playing a game about what the money you <br/>\nspent on a toaster or blender or coffee pot (or other household things) <br/>\nmight have bought instead.  Food for animals in the animal shelter.  A <br/>\nhearing aid for an old person.  Some really cool toys. Two more video games! <br/>\nConsider the possibilities, talk about all the different reasons we make the <br/>\nchoices we make,  and maybe if it comes up again between them, your son will <br/>\nbe able to consider it philosophically,  without it hurting his feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":46477013,"authorName":"Ulrike Haupt","from":"&quot;Ulrike Haupt&quot; &lt;rica@...&gt;","profile":"ulrikehaupt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: What should I do about this situation?","postDate":"1269021901","msgId":43405,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjMwMWNhYzc4ZiQ1NjMyYzhlMCQxZTdiN2I3YkB1bHJpa2VjNjUwZmMxYj4=","referencesHeader":"PGhvMDM0Zis5MXBmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43403,"nextInTopic":43441,"prevInTime":43404,"nextInTime":43406,"topicId":43401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dearest Meredith Have I ever told you how impressed I am with the posts you send in reply to what others send out?

They are issues a lot of men struggle with as a parents of sons, and some handle more gracefully than others. Be gentle with your spouse as much as you can, he&#39;s dealing with some tough personal issues wrapped around ideas of masculinity and responsibility and what it means to be A Father.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Fili hates when I  <br/>\n&gt; criticize what he does with him. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is really tricky territory to negotiate because while on the one hand you want to stand up for your child, no-one likes to be criticized, and criticism doesn&#39;t tend to help relationships. In a sense, your dh&#39;s relationship with you ds is about them, not you or even unschooling. Its something they have to work out between them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen George and I were first together, he was pretty harsh with Ray. He saw that as his job as a Dad, to be the harsh guy, the rule-keeper, the &quot;asshole&quot; as he put it. He didn&#39;t like that, but he thought it was something he Had to do for Ray&#39;s benefit. My jumping in between them and leaving George feel like he was &quot;doing it wrong&quot; as a parent didn&#39;t help very much, it just left George feeling vulnerable and trying harder to be a Good Dad, and to him that meant the biggest &quot;asshole&quot; he could be. <br/>\n<br/>\nTalking to George when Ray wasn&#39;t around was more helpful. I could ask him what kind of relationship he Wanted to have with his son, and hear some of the baggage that men carry into fatherhood. I didn&#39;t argue with him about his baggage, and I think that helped. He didn&#39;t need me to help him process that stuff, he needed me to love him in all his imperfections. Beyond that, I worked on saying kind things to George about his parenting. I made an effort to notice, out loud, when he was patient, or sweet, or thoughtful. I found ways to let him know I appreciated how hard he was trying for the sake of his boy. I also found ways to offer him some of the same love and support I was offering the kids - to give George the same emotional benefits of unschooling, essentially. <br/>\n<br/>\nOver time, his attitude about what it meant to be a dad softened. He started offering more kindness to Ray, and saw the way their relationship improved. Nowadays George is a committed radical unschooling parent - some of that is likely personality, but he&#39;s also not unique. Other dads have made the same unlikely transition, part way or all the way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Anyway, what happened is  <br/>\n&gt; my husband got mad earlier yesterday because I told my 11 yo son he  <br/>\n&gt; could buy a used video game. He had some money and I didn&#39;t mind  <br/>\n&gt; giving him a few dollars.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is something that would likely be better discussed when things calm down a little - not the situation itself, but the underlying ideas of &quot;who&#39;s money is it&quot; and how the decision to give it / spend it comes about. There are two different parts to that, too - what kind of expectations does you dh have about the money your son &quot;has&quot; - is it a gift, is it something he&#39;s worked for and &quot;owns&quot; or is it something he&#39;s been entrusted with. Most parents will say money &quot;belongs&quot; to the child but treat it like a trust, with conditions on it. So having those expectations in clear air could help. Again, I&#39;m not saying you should argue or criticize. It may be better to let your husband vent his feelings on the matter so he can feel heard and validated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other part of the issue is that you gave your ds some money - whose money was it? Was it &quot;family money&quot;? or part of your designated &quot;spending money&quot;? If it was &quot;family money&quot; then maybe your dh feels left out of the process. If he&#39;s the main income provider, he may even feel like its &quot;his&quot; money, and you&#39;re merely entrusted with it. That&#39;s an uncomfortable situation for you, for sure, but if its something you know up-front, rather than an implied expectation, its easier to make decisions about how you want to deal with that in personal terms. If the money was &quot;yours&quot; then that&#39;s something else to discuss - you did not expect to be paid back in the fashion your dh is imposing on your child, and don&#39;t necessarily want that kind of repayment in the future. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo y&#39;all know any other unschoolers in real life, or is there a way your dh can meet some unschooling dads? There are some fantastic dads out there who are pretty darned &quot;manly&quot; without being &quot;assholes&quot; and that might be soothing to your dh.

He was made to work at an early age of 6 I think. He had to get  <br/>\nup at 4am and check on the animals miles from his house and then still  <br/>\ngo to school. I myself feel like a child should have  1-2 little   <br/>\nchores like dishes or feeding a peg. I had chores and didn&#39;t always do  <br/>\nthem and now I don&#39;t enjoy them as an adult. Anyway, what happened is  <br/>\nmy husband got mad earlier yesterday because I told my 11 yo son he  <br/>\ncould buy a used video game. He had some money and I didn&#39;t mind  <br/>\ngiving him a few dollars. My husband Fili came home around 8:45pm and  <br/>\nsaid he needed our son to help him with work. He told me to save them  <br/>\ndinner. Well, it&#39;s 4:05 am and they are still not here! I am so pissed  <br/>\noff with him. I think it&#39;s crazy! Our son R does so much helping us  <br/>\naround the house and then he doesn&#39;t even want him to play video  <br/>\ngames?!?! Fili says he makes him get up earlier to help him cause he  <br/>\nwants him to be a man. He&#39;s still a kid! A great kid. R called me  <br/>\naround 11:30pm and told me that his dad said the money he could&#39;ve  <br/>\nused for the game, he could&#39;ve bought food instead. Then when Fili saw  <br/>\nRomeo was on the phone he made him hang up. Fili hates when I  <br/>\ncriticize what he does with him. Fili is not R&#39;s real dad but R  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know it. A friend told me that because he isn&#39;t his real son,  <br/>\nhe&#39;ll always be like that towarda him. I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know and I  <br/>\ncould really use your advice.
