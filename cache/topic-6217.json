It seems <br/>\nirrelivant what faith the *abuser* may or may not be.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause as a strong political group, as the only faith *I* know <br/>\nabout that loudly proclaims their God given right to use corporal <br/>\npunishment and believes God has INSTRUCTED them to hit, as a world <br/>\nreligion that advocates control over children, they WANT to be <br/>\nrecognized as separate and true Christians.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing Christian doesn&#39;t make you a spanker, at the same time, there <br/>\nis LOADS of information out there about how you are ignoring GOD if <br/>\nyou don&#39;t advocate the use of a rod or corporal punishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a large segment of my family that is Christian and believe <br/>\nstrongly in gentle parenting. Even the older generation of my <br/>\nChristian believing family advocate non-spanking.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, there is a very powerful body of Christians that speak out <br/>\nloudly and strongly encouraging parents to maintain &quot;control&quot; and <br/>\nkeep parenting in their toolbox. It&#39;s pretty yucky stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a lifelong Christian until a few years ago, as a member of a <br/>\nreligious group that quietly advocated spanking, as someone that has <br/>\nextensively studied the Bible, the history of Christianity and other <br/>\nreligions, I can emphatically state that Christians have one of the <br/>\nworst track records in that area.<br/>\nIt&#39;s changing. I have high hopes that the younger generations will <br/>\nchange the face of Christianity..I hope.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you live in an area of the world where Christians are by and <br/>\nlarge gentle, tolerant folks, just read here for an eye opener. I <br/>\nlive in the South btw, and there is more of the rabid type down here.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, folks spank in every walk of life, but not every group is <br/>\nencouraging it&#39;s other members to spank and hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s some food for thought:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.myfortress.org/spank_children.html\">http://www.myfortress.org/spank_children.html</a><br/>\n&quot;One evangelical leader writes:<br/>\n&quot;Scripture itself prescribes corporal discipline and cautions <br/>\nparents not to abandon the use of the rod.  The opinions of self-<br/>\nproclaimed experts who disagree frankly amount to little.  In the <br/>\nend, the facts will be found to agree with the Word of God...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bible.com/answers/aspankin.html\">http://www.bible.com/answers/aspankin.html</a><br/>\n&quot;Proverbs 23:13-14: &quot;Withold not discipline from the child, for if <br/>\nyou strike and punish him with the (reed-like) rod, he will not die. <br/>\nThou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from <br/>\nhell.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, discipline of children should begin at an early age, <br/>\nwhenever a child begins to defy the parent. Remember the old <br/>\nsaying, &quot;He who spares the rod, spoils the child.&quot; Notice that the <br/>\nBible says that all children have foolishness in their hearts.  The <br/>\nBible definition of a fool means one who is a rebel, so this is <br/>\nsaying that all children have rebellion in them and when it <br/>\nsurfaces, it is our duty as parents to drive it out of them.  We are <br/>\nto do this by punishing them with a whack on the buttocks with a <br/>\nsmall reed-like rod. This rod could be a switch from a fruit tree <br/>\nbranch or a willow tree branch or a small wooden spoon. It is not to <br/>\nbe a large heavy rod or anything that would cause permanent physical <br/>\ndamage.   The purpose of a spanking is not to cause any lasting <br/>\nbodily harm, but to cause spiritual correction.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s loads of this stuff out there. There are also Christians <br/>\nadvocating gentle parenting these days. But if you hear about a <br/>\nspanking Christian, that&#39;s why.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6052,"nextTopicId":6257}}
