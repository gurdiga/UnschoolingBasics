If you are trained in martial arts, your hands are considered deadly weapons.  Even if you are defending yourself, it may not be considered justifiable legally.  Once you are a black belt, you usually have been trained to take someone down nonviolently, but you still have to be careful.  A person who has been trained in martial arts who hits someone with their hand has just hit them with a deadly weapon.  Was that justifiable when some guy was just trying to steal your purse or something?  Most courts say no, unless you have had specific training in nonviolent defense.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is kind of like the guy who was robbing a store, fell through a skylight, sued the store, and won.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know it seems stupid, but in most places that is the law.  My son is fairly close to being able to test for his black belt, and we have talked about the fact that if he gets into a fist fight, it will not be looked at the same as a kid with no training.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty J.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6146,"nextTopicId":6174}}
