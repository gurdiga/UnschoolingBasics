There are no downloads, with one exception; everything is in  <br/>\neasy-to-use Flash video. (If a site uses Veoh.com to host the  <br/>\ncontent, Veoh may ask you to download its Veoh TV application, which  <br/>\nalso allows you to save the video to the hard drive. Incidentally,  <br/>\nVeoh is a legitimate site that says it takes copyrights seriously,  <br/>\nand was working Friday to remove the pirated videos.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kicker is that it also indexes sites that index pirated video,  <br/>\nusing a one-step-removed &quot;we just link to it&quot; argument. I flipped the  <br/>\nstory on its head for my story on PCMag.com:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2283141,00.asp\">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2283141,00.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  noting that a significant amount of video is archived on servers  <br/>\nhosted by Google and Veoh, both sites that have been accused (and  <br/>\nsued) for harboring pirated video in the past. If you have a  <br/>\ndesperate need to check out The Ruins as shot by a crappy camcorder  <br/>\nin a movie theater, feel free.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, the site&#39;s founders tell me that they attempt to only use  <br/>\nsites that don&#39;t embed spyware or any deceptive links in the sites  <br/>\nthey index. In practice, McAfee&#39;s SiteAdvisor warned me on occasion  <br/>\nthat a couple of the indexed sites contained links to other sites  <br/>\nthat harbored spyware -- not a direct threat in and of itself, but  <br/>\nwatch where you click.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212831948,"authorName":"hlg567","from":"&quot;hlg567&quot; &lt;halfshadow1@...&gt;","profile":"hlg567","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Watch new movies for free online! :)","postDate":"1229731443","msgId":37418,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdpaGNwaiszOXJsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg1Mzg2Mi45NTE5NS5xbUB3ZWI0NTgwNi5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":37403,"nextInTopic":37419,"prevInTime":37417,"nextInTime":37419,"topicId":37384,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We found this and many others from MSN that listed 100 great web sites.
