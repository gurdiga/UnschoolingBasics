First some background, I have a 15-<br/>\nmonth-old toddler (Tre, my son) who I&#39;m raising in a more-or-less <br/>\nattachment parenting style with intentions of continuing to unschool <br/>\nhim the rest of his life.  We currently live with my in-laws, who <br/>\nhave very strong feelings about how he should be raised, hense the <br/>\n&quot;more-or-less&quot; part (their kids were all spoiled but had artificial <br/>\nrestrictions at the same time, about the most backward way to raise a <br/>\nkid I&#39;ve heard of).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to my question.  Within the last couple of days, he&#39;s taken to <br/>\nscreaming whenever he can&#39;t accomplish something.  This is almost <br/>\nalways when it&#39;s the difficulty of the task that is causing him <br/>\nproblems.  Some examples: He screams as he carries around a 2lb <br/>\ndumbell in each hand.  He screams as he tries to drag a blanket off <br/>\nmy chair which is caught on something.  He screams when he can&#39;t <br/>\nreach something he wants.  He screams when the space he&#39;s trying to <br/>\nenter is too small for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any ideas of how to curb this behavior (the <br/>\nscreaming, not the striving for the difficult/impossible) other than <br/>\nsimply telling him not to scream (or solving his problem, which is <br/>\nlikely to lead to extreme spoiling and isn&#39;t always possible)?  I&#39;m <br/>\nreally at a loss as to what to do here.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6745,"nextTopicId":6743}}
