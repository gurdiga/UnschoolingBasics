For example, I was on a list for discussing &quot;Positive  <br/>\nDiscipline&quot; and most of the posts were about different systems -  <br/>\ngiving coupons for good behavior that get the kid out of doing dishes  <br/>\nfor an evening, giving points throughout the week that could earn  <br/>\ndifferent little toys at the end of each week, having &quot;penny jars&quot;  <br/>\nfor the kids and giving them a penny each time the mom catches them  <br/>\ndoing something good. There is a great deal of discussion on those  <br/>\nkinds of lists about overly-permissive parents who don&#39;t discipline  <br/>\ntheir children enough and about how kids really need parents to set  <br/>\nboundaries for them and to consistently follow-through by punishing  <br/>\n(or by withholding rewards - which IS a punishment) so the kids will  <br/>\nlearn. My ideas are not welcome there and I could easily go there and  <br/>\nget my feelings hurt and feel that they are attacking my family,  <br/>\npersonally. But, truth is, they don&#39;t know my family and they just  <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe that our kind of non-punitive parenting can work, so  <br/>\nthey assume my kids must be out of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey DO think their way is better, for sure. I think they&#39;re wrong -  <br/>\nI think they aren&#39;t seeing the potential for problems that they are  <br/>\ncreating. If they want to know what I think, I&#39;m here and willing to  <br/>\ntalk. If they don&#39;t ask - then it isn&#39;t my business to force my ideas  <br/>\non them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 30, 2006, at 10:41 AM, mooosey3 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I really don&#39;t think anyone is being elite or snarky here.

Following the last similar<br/>\ndisagreement on the always unschooled list, we were directed here for<br/>\nthe &#39;basics&#39; however, it&#39;s the same elite group here, as it was there,<br/>\nrunning off perfectly honest and truthful people who just want to make<br/>\nthese changes in their worlds. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hi Kristin,<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I was on that list, I saw that disagreement and the direction to come here.  I was already a member here, too, at the time.  I left that particular list soon after that- I didn&#39;t feel like wading through the disagreements- I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d get as much out of the group... it seemed a well settled, tight-knit group and it was difficult for more than a few of us to &quot;fit in&quot;.  I figured it would easier going over here and so stayed here.  But as you say, many of the same folks are here too!  And here we are with the same arguements as over there... <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I didn&#39;t want to be bashed; I wasn&#39;t sure that my opinions weren&#39;t just held by *me*, and I didn&#39;t want to rock an already unsteady boat so I&#39;ve lurked.  But, having seen your response it is obvious that is is more than just me feeling awkward or less than accepted, and I want to share with everyone my feelings as I tried to explain them to someone else privately.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  From day one of parenting (oldest dd is 15 next week), me and dh have tried to live the life of gentle parenting and helping the kids be their best. It took a about 5 years to completely break out of the mold our parents taught us. But we accomplished it- no swats or spanks, no forced &quot;clean plate club&quot;,  no forcing an apology (although we do remind the kids of that option if they feel inclined to) and just about everything else you&#39;ve questioned. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We don&#39;t even have bedtimes! The kids figured it out on their own when was good to go to bed, without more than a gentle reminder of &quot;You have school tomorrow and have to be up at 5am&quot;.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I still need work on judging what is a mistake, and what is intentional at times.  (the incident with Ren&#39;s son for instance).  I still have a short fuse and have to work really hard at holding it in.  I&#39;m passionate- I used to splurt loudly and then I could discuss after. This has taken the longest for me to &quot;get over&quot;, and I still do it more often than I wish.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Admittedly, I still don&#39;t educationally unschool.  We use computer games and some workbooks. We use craft books and reading books.  We do a lot of hands-on math.  My son has a few learning differences- the biggest being severe dyslexia which effects reading, spelling, and math. A lot of schoolwork has to be modified for his needs.   We do a &quot;child-led&quot; curriculum.  I feel I need to help him out while he does his own thing.  I believe as another poster said that my son will never find the joy of reading on his own because of his problems.. it is a trial, a chore, something very hard for him.  I don&#39;t force it on him or shove it down his throat, but I do introduce it often to him and with the help of curriculum tools if necessary.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My dd/13 will be homeschooled this year and she asked for curriculum.  I would be told by this and other groups to &quot;deschool&quot; her.  Let her &quot;veg out&quot; and she won&#39;t want the curriculum. But at the same time we are told to &quot;trust our kids&quot;, and I truly feel this is what she wants- not what she thinks she needs, or what she thinks I want her to have, or what she has been brainwashed to need.  She has interests that without a book she&#39;s not going to get- such as algebra. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I saw a post on another list.. or maybe it was this list..  that a parent was basically told to &quot;talk dd out of&quot; going back to public school... this coming right after a post to trust our kids wants and needs.  Educationally speaking, a lot of times unschooling is confusing and I feel words and directives- advice- can be bent to match whatever keeps a kid out of public school or doing &quot;schooly&quot; work. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Not that I like PS, don&#39;t get me wrong!  I&#39;d keep all 3 home if they wanted it! My oldest dd/15 has chosen to stay in PS.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I still run into issues and regress to &quot;traditional&quot; methods, (yelling, the blame game) so I&#39;m not perfect, and I am still running into new things as the kids grown older and throw new experiences at me.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I mention all this to show that a lot of time unschooling seems so black and white- either you radically unschool (which is good) or you traditionally parent (which is bad).  A lot of times it is pushed as &quot;do or die&quot;.  I personally don&#39;t think that is the case. You can live a certain amount of unschooled life and still hold onto certain aspects of other parenting styles and not be bad or good, right or wrong.   You guys like to use the vegetarian analogy- a meat eater doesn&#39;t go to a veggie list and say &quot;eat meat!&quot; and not expect to be questioned.  I&#39;d also say that there are different vegetarians... some eat dairy, some don&#39;t.  It doesn&#39;t make either one better. They&#39;re striving for basically the same thing but taking slightly different paths.  I&#39;m sure either group of vegetarians would be very incensed to be told by the other  that they weren&#39;t as good because they didn&#39;t see eye to eye on all issues even though they basically were comrades.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  A LOT of good parents gentle-parent but don&#39;t radically unschool, and I defy anyone to say that because they are radical unschoolers that it makes them better parents than good &quot;traditional parents&quot; (traditional in the sense that they respect their kids, gently parent, but send their kids to school or school-at-home).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;m not new to the basic principles of unschooling, and not really new to the radical ideas of educational unschooling. For years  I&#39;ve investigated, read, talked to other unschoolers, been on various lists, have personal unschooling and radical unschooling friends, did unschooling things before I even realized there was a label for it!, etc etc. DH and I have really soul-searched and discussed with each other what is best for our family.  We chose to &quot;unschool lite&quot;- not be radicals but definitely follow the gentle and peaceful parenting methods to our best ability. We provide a partnership with our kids, trust them to make good decisions, gently guide them to better opportunities or choices based on experience, not our personal biases, and parent with respect instead of fear tactics like punishment, retrubition, disapproval, etc. We fail sometimes, we apologize, we learn.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  However, I am fairly new to the list- within the last month or so- with THIS email account.  I&#39;ve been here quite a while under different accounts in the past before getting my yahoo account.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I find many of my comments or questions either go unnoticed and unanswered, or I am told to take my thoughts off-list because they &quot;don&#39;t fit&quot; here. Recently this dealt with foods and medical issues, certainly not something like &quot;spanking is a great method&quot;, which obviously doesn&#39;t fall into gentle parenting and WE DO NOT DO, lest anyone assume because I used the example that I also advocate it or live by it.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  There are certain folks who have been living this style and have been on the lists a long time..  They are the major contributors to posting, and I feel they believe they have the position- the right- to give advice, to critique or criticise, to offend &quot;for your betterment&quot;, and to choose who is and isn&#39;t okay to post, and what is and isn&#39;t acceptable to say in the post.  They feel it appropriate to tell people &quot;don&#39;t post&quot;, &quot;take it elsewhere&quot;, &quot;find another list&quot;.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;ll get flamed I am sure, but in the not so distant past other folks were told &quot;find another waterfountain&quot;, &quot;take your seat elsewhere (like the back of the bus)&quot;.  It was thought be appropriate or acceptable to do that because they were different.  The couldn&#39;t be equals or as smart or capable or involved or as viable a part of society because of their race.  Here, on these lists, it&#39;s about who is smarter , more experienced, or &quot;gets it&quot; based on how long you&#39;ve been on the list.  The rest of us poor saps aren&#39;t as smart or capable or involved, or as viable a part of parenting because of our new-ness.  If you don&#39;t already meet that certain standard based upon a few people&#39;s decision, then it&#39;s very hard to  be taken seriously, or be answered in a fair balanced way instead of being picked apart.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  And I am soooo tired of being told defensiveness or feelings of &quot;not fitting in&quot; are based on my problems and I should look inward.  Could it just be that there really is a problem with something other than me or Rachel, or Kristin, or anyone else? That there is an elitist &quot;I&#39;m better than you&quot; feel that turns people off?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  It is assumed that if you are new to the list that you are automatically new to anything other than traditional parenting and so therefore automatically the newbie is already low on the totem pole, less than a person or parent and the group thinks they are better. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  So, just wanted to say to Rachel and Kristin, don&#39;t feel left out or take it too personally. I find this list to often be elitist even if they choose to say it is &quot;confidence&quot;.  Most unschooling sites are, and many of them have the same folks from this list. I&#39;ve left a majority of the lists because they weren&#39;t so much helping as just picking apart other people&#39;s feelings and concerns/questions. I like the groups when they discuss new tactics without attacking. Unfortunately, these types of topics and nitpicky responses tend to monopolize the list and very little of the &quot;good stuf&quot; gets through.<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Next-gen email?

If the mom had punished him he might have<br/>\nfelt that his sister got him in trouble.  He would know his act of<br/>\nshoving wasn&#39;t malicious but it would seem to him that his sister&#39;s act<br/>\nof getting him into trouble was.   It wouldn&#39;t have helped his<br/>\nrelationship with his mom or with his sister.  It would have created bad<br/>\nfeelings all around.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHis sister might have felt satisfied about her brother getting into<br/>\ntrouble.  Her actions might have reflected that.  It wouldn&#39;t help her<br/>\nbrother think clearly about the incident or think of what he might have<br/>\ndone differently, it would have made him feel angry.  He might harbor<br/>\nresentment about his sister and a feeling his mom cared more about her<br/>\nthan she did about him.  None of those negative emotions and thoughts<br/>\nwould have contributed to his developing awareness of the value of<br/>\ncareful judgement and compassion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mom&#39;s actions comforted the injured sister, comforted the scared and<br/>\nconfused brother and set an example to the kids about the healing power<br/>\nof compassion.  They have one more example of a good way to handle a<br/>\nproblem.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I find it hard to instinctively reward a poor, unkind choice.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWe shouldn&#39;t think of compassion as a reward.  It&#39;s our children&#39;s right<br/>\nto always have our compassion.  It&#39;s manipulative and damaging to<br/>\nwithhold it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mom wasn&#39;t rewarding bad behavior, she was loving a child in a moment<br/>\nwhen he didn&#39;t use the best judgement.   Punishment can&#39;t make a child<br/>\nhave better judgement.  Good judgement comes from seeing others practice<br/>\nit and from time and experience and guidance.
