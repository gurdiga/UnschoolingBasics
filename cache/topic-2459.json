I think when I began hs&#39;ing I stumbled on a web <br/>\nsite of theirs.<br/>\nIm sorry you live in such an area. Seems as though we are living in an area <br/>\nof not so nice parenting either. <br/>\n<br/>\n*******Caution a lil vent comming**** <br/>\nWhere we are homeschool is not the norm and unschooling is almost unheard of <br/>\n(at least in our town) or advertised.<br/>\n<br/>\n There is even a family down the street (following the below situation) who <br/>\ntold their kids that they cannot play with our son bc he doesn&#39;t listen to his <br/>\nparents. (Our son has told them he has no chores, rules or schoolwork.)  They <br/>\nonly looked at the surface of what he said (while they were grilling him about <br/>\nwhat he does all day) didn&#39;t bother to look at him, the *happy* child their <br/>\nkids have been playing with for a couple years now. I guess one of the kids <br/>\nhasn&#39;t been doing his assigned &quot;chore&quot; and its all my sons fault. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother dad (who knows this other family) has been harassing my son and us <br/>\nfor almost a year now. It got to the point where he was following him and making <br/>\ncruel comments bc my son of all the kids in the neighborhood (12-15) chooses <br/>\nnot to play with his son (who appears to be abused from what I have seen). AND <br/>\nbc he (our son) is homeschooled (he called my son &quot;A STUPID SOB&quot; in front of <br/>\nhis friends). There were a couple other situations like driving to endanger <br/>\nand discussing my child with some in the neighborhood (which caused some pretty <br/>\nsad gossip that brought me to tears). Plus he calls my son over to his van so <br/>\nhe can lecture him and my son runs so he thinks he is disrespectful. Ive told <br/>\nhim to stay away but he choose not to.<br/>\nWell, to make a long story short I got tired of calling the police. I went <br/>\nand got protection from harassment order, we go to court this Friday. I am not <br/>\nsure what I will say to the judge as I wrote it all in my statement but I hope <br/>\nthe order will stay for the two years. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts sad that children become prey and the adults get away with it. Well, in <br/>\nour case I hope he doesn&#39;t. But I will say that defending ourselves was <br/>\nNOT-AT-ALL the popular thing to do in this neighborhood. They have no idea all that <br/>\nhas happened and just say it was kids stuff and we should not have involved the <br/>\npolice. <br/>\nSorry for the vent but I have been wanting to discuss this with you all and <br/>\njust haven&#39;t had the time to explain enough to make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura~<br/>\n****************************************************************<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Have you read &quot;To train up a child&quot; by the Pearls? They live a few hours<br/>\nfrom here. I was given that book by a friend and others have recommended it.<br/>\nI share that to say that around here it is &quot;normal&quot; to hear new parents tell<br/>\nhow they are sitting toys around on the floor and they swat babies hands<br/>\nwhen they reach for something. Only the toy offered to them is ok to touch.<br/>\nBabies/ toddlers are taught to sit on a small piece of carpet during<br/>\nmeetings and not get off.Or Mama carries a switch to &quot;train&quot; jr.<br/>\n  I know from experience this doesn&#39;t teach respect and create a peaceful<br/>\nenvironment for kids. It is easy for Mom/Dad.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2449,"nextTopicId":2440}}
