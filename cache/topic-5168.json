My kids are 8 and 10 and they have had<br/>\n  free access to satellite TV for several years.  They are very selective<br/>\n  about the time they spend watching.  They only watch when they are<br/>\n  interested in what is on.  But we didn&#39;t always have satellite TV nor did I<br/>\n  always let them have free access.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  When they were little (2,3,4) , they didn&#39;t ask to watch TV much and I<br/>\n  didn&#39;t encourage it. Actually, my oldest didn&#39;t like it much and there were<br/>\n  days that I wished she&#39;d watch at least a half an hour of TV to give me a<br/>\n  little break. :-)  As they got a little older (5,6 ish) they started to like<br/>\n  it more and want to watch it more on some days.  That was when I got a<br/>\n  little nervous about it and started to limit it.  We only had a few channels<br/>\n  at the time and videos, but I had read about those studies (not really<br/>\n  thought about it) and I didn&#39;t want to mess my kids up by letting them watch<br/>\n  too much TV.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Most of the time life was busy enough that TV wasn&#39;t a major draw, but once<br/>\n  in a while, they&#39;d want to watch more than I was comfortable with.  I felt<br/>\n  like if I set a rule about the amount of time they could watch, that when<br/>\n  that time was up, they&#39;d be no arguments.  I could blame it on the rule.<br/>\n  So, I made a rule that they could each pick a show and each watch each<br/>\n  other&#39;s show and then the TV would be off for the day. &lt;live and learn&gt;<br/>\n  Having that rule made watching TV seem much more valuable than it had seemed<br/>\n  before we had that rule.  It stopped the arguing after the first few days<br/>\n  because I was pretty consistent about it, but it did nothing to enhance my<br/>\n  relationship with my children.  In fact, it made them angry with me and it<br/>\n  made them feel controlled.  They saw it for what it was, an arbitrary rule<br/>\n  that I enforced upon them.  They started watching TV every day to make sure<br/>\n  they got what they were due.  Before the rule, often days would pass and no<br/>\n  one would even turn the TV on.  Now it was on every day so they felt they<br/>\n  got their fair share.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then, after reading on different unschooling lists, I realized how unfair I<br/>\n  had been.  I started saying YES if they asked to watch more than their one<br/>\n  show.  I stopped saying no, altogether.  Sometime in there, we ended up<br/>\n  getting satellite TV with a lot of channels.  (We&#39;ve had it so long I can&#39;t<br/>\n  remember living without it now.maybe 5 years ago.)  There were days when<br/>\n  they watched more TV than I was comfortable with (sometimes all day long)<br/>\n  but it was when they finally realized that I wasn&#39;t going to limit their<br/>\n  viewing anymore that they became more selective in their viewing choices.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our lives are interesting and full and TV is just another option, not one<br/>\n  that they are drawn to more than any other activity.  (because it&#39;s not<br/>\n  limited and because we have an interesting life)   They love games and being<br/>\n  read to and horse back riding and playing with their friends, etc.  I think<br/>\n  I got the most benefit out of changing my view on TV.  I used to feel some<br/>\n  level of guilt whenever I watched TV. Our society sees watching TV as a<br/>\n  waste of time and I fell for that.  I always used to feel like I had to do<br/>\n  something useful while I watched TV, like knit or something.  After I did a<br/>\n  lot of thinking about how TV affects our personal lives (it doesn&#39;t make me<br/>\n  or my kids into zombies and we often learn so much from it)   I chose to<br/>\n  leave that feeling of guilt behind. I no longer feel guilty about enjoying<br/>\n  TV.  I also stopped counting the hours that we watch TV because I stopped<br/>\n  judging the value of it.  I am on longer obsessed with how much or how<br/>\n  little TV we watch.  We just watch it when we want to and turn it off when<br/>\n  we don&#39;t.  Some days we watch more than others and some days and weeks (in<br/>\n  the warmer weather) we don&#39;t even turn it on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  They are free to watch whatever they want.  If it is something that I find<br/>\n  questionable (which doesn&#39;t happen very often) I make sure to sit with them<br/>\n  so I can answer any questions that they might have.  It hasn&#39;t been a<br/>\n  problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This morning the girls watched Kid Concoctions (although my 10 yo was<br/>\n  looking for Arthur) and another half hour show (?) and turned it off.  They<br/>\n  are now playing horses on the living room rug.  We&#39;ll be heading to the barn<br/>\n  soon.  The vet comes to give spring shots to the horses today.  That should<br/>\n  be fun to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am so glad I relaxed about TV and stopped letting it *rule* our home.  As<br/>\n  other&#39;s have said, I think it is the responsibility of the unschooling<br/>\n  parent to make life interesting for their unschooled kids.  If TV is the<br/>\n  most interesting thing in your whole day, then you need to help your<br/>\n  children find out what their interests are.  Not just so they won&#39;t watch TV<br/>\n  all day but because that&#39;s what a good unschooling parent does.  They help<br/>\n  their children find interesting things to do and see and go.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Angela<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

For my son, who is wired much more to remember what he hears, and is dramatic and kinesthetic, books just don&#39;t do what a TV show with rich colors, memorable spoken words and lots of &#39;real&#39; action can do.

I can&#39;t seem to find one. What I did <br/>\n&gt; find<br/>\n&gt; (over and over and over) is a quote from &quot;Battle for Your Mind: <br/>\n&gt; Subliminal<br/>\n&gt; Programming&quot;: by Dick Sutphen:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Recent tests by researcher Herbert Krugman showed that, while viewers <br/>\n&gt; were<br/>\n&gt; watching TV, right-brain activity outnumbered left-brain activity by a <br/>\n&gt; ratio<br/>\n&gt; of two to one. Put more simply, the viewers were in an altered state . <br/>\n&gt; . .<br/>\n&gt; in trance more often than not. They were getting their Beta-endorphin <br/>\n&gt; &quot;fix.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To measure attention spans, psychophysiologist Thomas Mulholland of the<br/>\n&gt; Veterans Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts, attached young viewers to <br/>\n&gt; an<br/>\n&gt; EEG machine that was wired to shut the TV set off whenever the <br/>\n&gt; children&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; brains produced a majority of alpha waves. Although the children were <br/>\n&gt; told<br/>\n&gt; to concentrate, only a few could keep the set on for more than 30 <br/>\n&gt; seconds!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Left brain activity (according to an anatomy and physiology text) is<br/>\n&gt; associated with spoken and written language, numerical and scientific <br/>\n&gt; skills<br/>\n&gt; and reasoning. Right brain activity is associated with musical and <br/>\n&gt; artistic<br/>\n&gt; awareness, space and pattern perception, insight, imagination, <br/>\n&gt; generating<br/>\n&gt; mental images to compare spatial relationships. (No connection is made<br/>\n&gt; between right brained activities and being in a trance like state.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From that list, it makes sense to me that TV watching would be a right<br/>\n&gt; brained activity. I suppose if there&#39;s something inherently wrong with <br/>\n&gt; right<br/>\n&gt; brained activities, we should stop kids from drawing and imagining and <br/>\n&gt; being<br/>\n&gt; insightful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The text says that alpha waves are present in the EEGs of nearly all <br/>\n&gt; normal<br/>\n&gt; individuals when they are awake and resting with their eyes closed. <br/>\n&gt; These<br/>\n&gt; waves disappear entirely during sleep. Beta waves generally appear <br/>\n&gt; when the<br/>\n&gt; nervous system is active, that is, during periods of sensory input and<br/>\n&gt; mental activity. (Not that it says generally.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (Just as an interesting factoid, it says delta waves occur during deep <br/>\n&gt; sleep<br/>\n&gt; but they are also normal in an awake infant.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another site says alpha waves are brought out by closing the eyes and <br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt; relaxation, and abolished by eye opening or alerting by any mechanism<br/>\n&gt; (thinking, calculating). It is the major rhythm seen in normal relaxed<br/>\n&gt; adults - it is present during most of life especially beyond the <br/>\n&gt; thirteenth<br/>\n&gt; year when it dominates the resting tracing. (Alpha waves are also <br/>\n&gt; present<br/>\n&gt; during meditation and hypnosis.) And that beta waves are the dominant <br/>\n&gt; rhythm<br/>\n&gt; in patients who are alert or anxious or who have their eyes open.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That would suggest people aren&#39;t thinking when they watch TV. But does <br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; make sense? I could list off a huge number of things that I&#39;ve learned <br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; watching TV. How can learning take place without thinking? There is <br/>\n&gt; also<br/>\n&gt; research into Controlling Computers With Neural Signals (in Scientific<br/>\n&gt; American) which uses Alpha and Mu waves. If alpha waves stop when <br/>\n&gt; thought<br/>\n&gt; happens, how could those waves be used to perform a computer action if <br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; have to stop thinking in order to generate them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What it really means is that people enjoy dabbling in pseudo-science. <br/>\n&gt; They<br/>\n&gt; are using faulty logic -- hypnosis may generate alpha but that doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; mean<br/>\n&gt; alpha indicates hypnosis, thinking may generate beta but that doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; mean<br/>\n&gt; that beta indicates thinking (or that lack of beta means lack of <br/>\n&gt; thinking)<br/>\n&gt; -- to draw a conclusion to fit their theory.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To get a more complete picture we need to know what the waves look <br/>\n&gt; like when<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re deeply involved in a novel. Or watching a play. Or playing a <br/>\n&gt; video<br/>\n&gt; game. Or watching a sporting event. Or painting. Or gazing down at a<br/>\n&gt; sleeping or nursing infant. (Not that it would indicate anything. It <br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; just be more data on how the brain operates.) If alpha waves increased<br/>\n&gt; during those times, should we stop those things? Or does it merely <br/>\n&gt; mean that<br/>\n&gt; “thinking stops alpha waves” and “beta is present during mental <br/>\n&gt; activity”<br/>\n&gt; are too simplistic and don&#39;t adequately describe what&#39;s going on?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=========<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And while I think that<br/>\n&gt; there are wonderful resources for our families available in things<br/>\n&gt; such as nature videos and the history channel - a good book will do<br/>\n&gt; the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A book can&#39;t show you a running cheetah.

My <br/>\nfamily just put our television away for a month at the beginning of <br/>\nMarch.  The relationship between my children has changed for the <br/>\nbetter, my husband and I have more time to really talk to each <br/>\nother.  And we have not had cable - just a few network channels, and <br/>\nwatched movies that we own or rent.  There are several books out <br/>\nthere - Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television and another <br/>\none called TV turn off if you are interested in resources.  Studies <br/>\nhave shown that when we watch television our bodies go into a <br/>\ncomatose like state - breathing slows, brain activity hums along <br/>\nsluggishly with barely a blip on the radar.  As heavy television <br/>\nviewers, we are merely spectators in life.  And while I think that <br/>\nthere are wonderful resources for our families available in things <br/>\nsuch as nature videos and the history channel - a good book will do <br/>\nthe same.  A child can really pause and contemplate over pictures of <br/>\nlet&#39;s say a Civil War soldier rather than having hundreds of images <br/>\nthrust at him rapid speed.  As Americans we are so used to having <br/>\neverything fast and easy.  Those fact thrown at us at mach speed do <br/>\nnot equate real learning.  Cave children watching their family <br/>\nmembers live in real life, where there were actual people to talk to <br/>\nthat they were interacting with cannot be equated to our children <br/>\nwatching sex, violence, and poo on television.  And who is to say <br/>\nthat those novels weren&#39;t the downfall of our society?  Do we still <br/>\nlive with Victorian morals and values?   Television is like giving <br/>\nyour children a drug.  I know there will be fall out from this <br/>\ncomment and defensiveness - but I challenge you to take it out of <br/>\nyour homes for even a week and see if there is a difference in your <br/>\nchildren.  As unschooling parents, you are surely willing to try <br/>\nsomething new, different, out of the ordinary.  <br/>\nBest wishes - Julie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5238,"nextTopicId":5252}}
