Really?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me tell you, you don&#39;t and are very wrong.  <br/>\nI never said I was resentful at all for having to pick up after my dd <br/>\nor my family.  I was asking questions about how others handle these <br/>\nsituations.  I clean up after my whole family all the time with no <br/>\ncomplaint.  DH and I usually do a deep clean on Saturday and the kids <br/>\njust jump in and help because they want too.  No one forces them to <br/>\ndo anything.  They want to be part of the fun!  I don&#39;t even ask dh <br/>\nto help, he too jumps in and helps because he wishes too.  :)  We <br/>\nusually put on some music and dance, laugh and make merry all while <br/>\nwe put the house into a clean order again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do understand a youngin that has his own business, because my kids <br/>\nare the same way.  See I have grown kids as well as teens in the <br/>\nhouse too.  My 15 yr old ds raises and sells registered Netherland <br/>\nDwarf rabbits.  He also does small engine repair and is very into <br/>\nracing.  Every venture he has decided to try or go into, he has <br/>\nworked to finance himself, because he had the drive to do it.  He is <br/>\nthe one that loves animals so much that he keeps adding things to our <br/>\nfarm and he freely helps with all the farm chores.  (The girls help <br/>\ntoo because they find it fun to feed the animals and help with their <br/>\ncare.  We all love animals!)  When my kids have a desire, they find a <br/>\nway to fill that desire.  That is the fun of unschooling!  And the <br/>\nfreedom of it too.  :)  <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;I was mowing the grass earlier this week, thinking of this very  <br/>\nsituation. Our neighbors have a lawn care service that comes weekly. <br/>\nHe (the  lawn care guy) pointed out that didn&#39;t I have a teenage son <br/>\nand why wasn&#39;t he mowing the lawn? I said I *liked* mowing the lawn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe too!   It is theraputic.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Many of Cameron&#39;s friends are forced to help around the house <br/>\nbecause &quot;it&#39;s *their* house too and they need to take responsibility <br/>\nof *their* house.&quot; At the same time, they told that they aren&#39;t <br/>\nallowed to do such-and-such &quot;not while you&#39;re living under *MY* <br/>\nroof.&quot;  Talk about mixed signals!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo kidding!  I want my kids to take pride in the home they live in <br/>\nand am always thankful when they choose to help keep it clean.  I can <br/>\nsay the only time I could see the words {&quot;not while you&#39;re living <br/>\nunder *MY* roof&quot;} used is if it were about using drugs or drinking <br/>\nalcohol.  This is NOT a line I can ever see us using with our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the conference, finances would not allow any such luxury.  DH <br/>\nonly gets a small disability check monthly.  We also couldn&#39;t leave <br/>\nthe animals with no care, nor taking the time away from our kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Amanda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Being part of a family/community","postDate":"1089544890","msgId":1770,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEMTY5QUZBLjI4RjExJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEVBRUFJSkpKSURLSUFCTUVOT0hJSUVKTkNEQUEuZ21jb250cmFjdGluZ2luY0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":1769,"nextInTopic":1806,"prevInTime":1769,"nextInTime":1771,"topicId":1736,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"on 7/10/04 11:15 PM, G&M Contracting Inc., Kenneth Gillilan at ...

Maybe they will find<br/>\ncleaning the house a positive thing not something they dread doing, like I<br/>\ndo.  I think of my mother every time I clean and believe me it&#39;s not nice<br/>\nthoughts.

She wasn&#39;t<br/>\nexpected to clean up after herself or help do anything around the house.<br/>\nWhen she was 17, and had a job her mom would iron all of her clothes for her<br/>\nand make her lunch.<br/>\n    I asked her what she thought about how she grew up and for her opinion<br/>\non chores and such.  Her response kind of surprised me.  She wished that her<br/>\nmom had made her do her own laundry and clean the house.  She said that when<br/>\nshe went to college out of state she was terrified, because she didn&#39;t know<br/>\nhow to do anything.  She used to call her mom, crying because she felt so<br/>\ninsecure.  Her mom always did the cleaning and care of the house in front of<br/>\nher, but it was up to my friend whether she wanted to participate or not.<br/>\nMost of the time she chose not to, and in the end didn&#39;t pick up on how<br/>\nthings were done.<br/>\n   I don&#39;t require that my kids do chores or pick up after themselves, but<br/>\nwhat happens when they are ready to move out.  Maybe being homeschooled,<br/>\nwhich my friend was not, will make the difference here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnMarie<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: earthmothergypsy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:earthmothergypsy@...\">earthmothergypsy@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, July 10, 2004 6:44 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Being part of a family/community<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My dh and I got to talking today as we did our normal Saturday family<br/>\n  house cleaning about family living being the same as community<br/>\n  living.  This meaning that it takes EVERYONE in the group doing their<br/>\n  part to make it all work.  This means that no one should walk away<br/>\n  from a job that needs done, nor should they leave a mess/work for<br/>\n  someone else or the community or family will break down and it won&#39;t<br/>\n  work.<br/>\n  This is what triggered our conversation:<br/>\n  6 yr old DD finished breakfast and left her cereal bowl on the table-<br/>\n  with milk still in it (which then was dumped all over the table as<br/>\n  her little sister 2 yr old, played in it).  This left double work for<br/>\n  me (or anyone else that came along to clean up), because not only did<br/>\n  the cereal bowl need carried to the kitchen, but now milk had to be<br/>\n  cleaned up too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our feeling is that everyone should pick up after themselves and not<br/>\n  make more work for others.  Taking responsibility for themselves and<br/>\n  their actions.  This way the family/community runs smoothly.  This<br/>\n  also allows more time to be together as a family (not mom and dad<br/>\n  constantly busy cleaning up after everyone).<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, how would you handle this?<br/>\n  To me, it really isn&#39;t fair for one person to be doing all the work.<br/>\n  Also, what are the kids learning if they aren&#39;t taking responsibility<br/>\n  for themselves?  That someone will always be there to do it, so it<br/>\n  isn&#39;t a big deal????  What a shocker it would be for them when there<br/>\n  is no one to do it for them later in life!  I have seen this happen!<br/>\n  Are we really doing right as parents by not teaching them to be<br/>\n  responsible for themselves?  What about as a part of society as a<br/>\n  whole?

OR are they learning to be part of the &quot;me&quot; society (they<br/>\n  are the only ones important and community isn&#39;t)?<br/>\n  Any thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hope that makes sense.  I don&#39;t always choose the best &quot;wording&quot;<br/>\n  sometimes, so please forgive me that.

I&#39;d rather have a grown child who is happy to clean up  <br/>\nbecause it is nicer that way, because he *wants* to, because he wants a nice  <br/>\nenvironment. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Our feeling is that everyone should pick up after themselves  and not <br/>\n </span></blockquote>make more work for others.  Taking responsibility for  themselves and <br/>\ntheir actions.  This way the family/community runs  smoothly.  This <br/>\nalso allows more time to be together as a family (not  mom and dad <br/>\nconstantly busy cleaning up after everyone).   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nYou&#39;re not being realistic. Community doesn&#39;t work like that (mostly  because <br/>\npeople have been made to clean up after themselves). There are those  that <br/>\ndon&#39;t contribute to the mess, those that don&#39;t contribute to the clean-up,  <br/>\nthose that make the messes, those that do the cleaning up----and everything in  <br/>\nbetween. The best thing we can do for our children is to joyfully clean up and  <br/>\nshow them that we value a clean space/world. They will follow our example.  <br/>\nForcing clean-up will only make the cleaner resentful if he&#39;s not doing it of  <br/>\nhis own free will. *You* are already are feeling resentful for having to  clean <br/>\nup after her---what are you modeling? Really?<br/>\n <br/>\nI was mowing the grass earlier this week, thinking of this very  situation. <br/>\nOur neighbors have a lawn care service that comes weekly. He (the  lawn care <br/>\nguy) pointed out that didn&#39;t I have a teenage son and why wasn&#39;t  he mowing the <br/>\nlawn? I said I *liked* mowing the lawn. <br/>\n <br/>\nMany of Cameron&#39;s friends are forced to help around the house because &quot;it&#39;s  <br/>\n*their* house too and they need to take responsibility of *their* house.&quot; At <br/>\nthe  same time, they told that they aren&#39;t allowed to do such-and-such &quot;not <br/>\nwhile  you&#39;re living under *MY* roof.&quot;  Talk about mixed signals!<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat you&#39;re suggesting is really opposite from what actually works. We  have <br/>\nliving, breathing proof of this. Come to the conference. See for  yourself!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":138085708,"authorName":"earthmothergypsy","from":"&quot;earthmothergypsy&quot; &lt;earthmothergypsy@...&gt;","profile":"earthmothergypsy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Being part of a family/community","postDate":"1089499458","msgId":1736,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjcHJnMitzMTZxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1745,"prevInTime":1735,"nextInTime":1737,"topicId":1736,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My dh and I got to talking today as we did our normal Saturday family house cleaning about family living being the same as community living.

This meaning that it takes EVERYONE in the group doing their <br/>\npart to make it all work.  This means that no one should walk away <br/>\nfrom a job that needs done, nor should they leave a mess/work for <br/>\nsomeone else or the community or family will break down and it won&#39;t <br/>\nwork. <br/>\nThis is what triggered our conversation:<br/>\n6 yr old DD finished breakfast and left her cereal bowl on the table-<br/>\nwith milk still in it (which then was dumped all over the table as <br/>\nher little sister 2 yr old, played in it).  This left double work for <br/>\nme (or anyone else that came along to clean up), because not only did <br/>\nthe cereal bowl need carried to the kitchen, but now milk had to be <br/>\ncleaned up too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur feeling is that everyone should pick up after themselves and not <br/>\nmake more work for others.  Taking responsibility for themselves and <br/>\ntheir actions.  This way the family/community runs smoothly.  This <br/>\nalso allows more time to be together as a family (not mom and dad <br/>\nconstantly busy cleaning up after everyone).  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how would you handle this?  <br/>\nTo me, it really isn&#39;t fair for one person to be doing all the work. <br/>\nAlso, what are the kids learning if they aren&#39;t taking responsibility <br/>\nfor themselves?  That someone will always be there to do it, so it <br/>\nisn&#39;t a big deal????  What a shocker it would be for them when there <br/>\nis no one to do it for them later in life!  I have seen this happen!  <br/>\nAre we really doing right as parents by not teaching them to be <br/>\nresponsible for themselves?  What about as a part of society as a <br/>\nwhole?  Are they learning in a way that they can be part of a <br/>\ncommunity?  OR are they learning to be part of the &quot;me&quot; society (they <br/>\nare the only ones important and community isn&#39;t)?  <br/>\nAny thoughts?  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that makes sense.  I don&#39;t always choose the best &quot;wording&quot; <br/>\nsometimes, so please forgive me that.   These are just our ponderings <br/>\ntoday.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Amanda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1895,"nextTopicId":1861}}
