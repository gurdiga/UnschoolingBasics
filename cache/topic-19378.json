Also, just curious, where are you in NC?  I am just over the border from Charlotte, NC in SC.  Anyway, I would read up on Unschooling as much as possible.  Or you might want to take a more relaxed or eclectic approach.  I myself just pulled my kids from public school a couple of months ago.  I decided immediately that I was not going to recreate school at home.  The thing that jumped out about your post and made me wonder is, what are you trying to keep up with and what gaps are you talking/and or worried about? The public school comes up with some specific method......all systematically, neatly laid out.  But it&#39;s not how children really learn.  And in 20 years will it really matter that Billy did not learn such and such, on exactly such and such date? I would not worry about imaginary gaps, or keeping up with anyone other than what your child wants. As for those<br/>\n tests, someone on the NC unschoolers group was just talking about that.  It does not say what test, how the test is to be administered, and you keep the test results on file in your home.  So you could just order one of those standardized tests off the net, give it to your child, ignore the results, and put it in a file.  But I&#39;d check with the people on that group, since they actually live in NC and could help you better than I can.  I might have some mis-information since I do live in SC, and our homeschooling law is different.  I hope this helps.<br/>\n  Kelly  <br/>\n<br/>\nalisonslp &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alisonslp@...\">alisonslp@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Hi all...
