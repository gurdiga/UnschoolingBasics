I <br/>\njust want to ask if you are positive that you can&#39;t receive any <br/>\ntherapy service through the public schools if you homeschool where <br/>\nyou live? Because I know families here in AZ who have received <br/>\nservices (speech therapy, psychologist, etc.), through the public <br/>\nschools, and their children have never been to school. Is it <br/>\npossible that this info was given to you by someone who wants to <br/>\nconvince you that school is the only way to go?<br/>\nI completely agree with Ren that I would encourage you to follow <br/>\nyour heart. What are your expectations for your child when sending <br/>\nhim/her (sorry, I don&#39;t remember what you said) to school? Generally <br/>\nspeaking it does not seem to be the case that &quot;special&quot; kids who go <br/>\nto school are having such a great time and are readily accepted for <br/>\nwho they are. In general school is very much about comparison; <br/>\nteachers compare the kids with eachother, kids compare themselves <br/>\nwith the other kids. I don&#39;t believe that is a good thing for any <br/>\nchild, but for yours??? Even less so, I would say. Why do that? Do <br/>\nyou normally parent from the heart? Then why stop because your child <br/>\nreaches &quot;school age&quot;?<br/>\nYou probably already belong to a Down&#39;s Syndrome parent support <br/>\ngroup. Have you tried to see if there are any parents there who <br/>\nhomeschool? <br/>\nJust some thoughts...<br/>\nSybelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8262,"nextTopicId":8285}}
