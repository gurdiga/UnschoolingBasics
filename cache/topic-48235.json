Mostly they&#39;re either to absolve the state of responsibility or to provide a clear line where it would make it possible to charge parents with educational neglect.

You could require her to do school every day and she would still not get a diploma from the state. What you DO need to do is know the laws of the state and determine what you absolutely MUST do to keep the state satisfied while also keeping things as open and transparent for your kids as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re making an assumption that everyone needs to know the same math, the same reading, the same history, etc as everyone else. And, if you&#39;re aiming for a state issued diploma, that may be the case (actually it generally isn&#39;t, since some kids take calculus in high school and others barely get past algebra and they both get diplomas - they all have to put in x amount of hours sitting a classroom labeled math but what they learn is not all the same). And, too, you (and she) are looking at math as something separate from living life day to day. Does she know if she receives correct change at the market? Can she figure out how much two donuts will cost and if she has enough money to cover it? Etc If so, she&#39;s doing just fine and knows plenty for what she needs. Schools take reading, math, etc and make them an end in themselves, a &#39;subject&#39;, but they are actually tools to accomplish a goal. It&#39;s kind of like requiring a skilled seamstress to spend an hour each day hammering in nails because that&#39;s an &quot;important subject&quot;. Well, if the seamstress finds that she needs to build a frame to display her quilts, that&#39;s when she might want to spend some time with a hammer.
