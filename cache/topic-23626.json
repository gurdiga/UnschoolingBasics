ANyway to introduce <br/>\nmyself and my family. I am Becca married for 13 years (today <br/>\nactually) to wounderful husband Glen. We live in Kansas dont know <br/>\nthat it is my favorite place to live in my lifetime but for <br/>\nhomeschooling regulations its one of the best states I feel where we <br/>\nhave our freedom to teach our kids how we feel is necessary and <br/>\nneeded for thier learning styles. We have 5 children and 1 on the <br/>\nway. 2 boys and 3 girls. 12, 8 are the boys and 9, 6, and 4 are <br/>\nthe girls. This baby is to be a boy due the end of Sept. We just <br/>\nstarted an unschooling coop group here due to the fact that a lot of <br/>\nhomeschooled moms dont understand what we are all about its <br/>\ninteresting to see their mouths drop and things come out with YOU <br/>\nCANT DO THAT THAT WAY........ A lot of people just don&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand. Its not a well known thing around this area although <br/>\ntraditional homeschooling is....  Does anyone have any ideas on how <br/>\nto get a conference going in the area we live in....<br/>\n<br/>\nIm glad to be a part of this group and cant wait to get to know you <br/>\nall...<br/>\n<br/>\nBecca</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23603,"nextTopicId":23607}}
