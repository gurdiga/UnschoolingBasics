I&#39;ve heard that the requirements are different (and easier to meet) for &#39;adult&#39; enrollees, meaning those who don&#39;t go straight from high school.  I know that the community college here in Albuquerque only requires that one be 18 and take the assessment test upon signing up for classes.  It&#39;s not an entrance exam, but a placement to let you choose the appropriate level of classes.  Most community colleges only care that you can pay -- qualifications are your own business.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nAhhh...imagining that irresistible &quot;new car&quot; smell?<br/>\n Check outnew cars at Yahoo!

I really do.  My son actually does want to <br/>\nvolunteer at the zoo and has applied.  He has helped out 3 times at a <br/>\nvet&#39;s office nearby and he has also been hanging out at our <br/>\nneighbor&#39;s taxidermist shop.  So he is doing some pretty cool <br/>\nthings.  He said yesterday that he is turning his bedroom into a <br/>\nzoologist office and has put posters up all over his room and <br/>\ndrawings he has made of various animal tracks,etc.  Yesterday when <br/>\nGrandma took him to the library, he came home with a pile of books on <br/>\nanimals and was reading them all afternoon and at bedtime.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I need to stay away from the curriculum websites.  I get <br/>\nconfused and tempted.  I receive these brochures and packets in the <br/>\nmail and sometimes I check them out.  I was looking into classical <br/>\nhomeschooling and was dazzled by the talk of Latin improving SAT <br/>\nscores and how important it is to read &quot;The Great Books&quot;...none of <br/>\nwhich I have read.  I myself went to our local state college and <br/>\nreceived a bachelor&#39;s in communication.  So I did not go to a &quot;top&quot; <br/>\nschool and as you all have surmised, don&#39;t really know much about <br/>\nit.  I do have several quick questions:  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you take the SAT more than once, is that reflected in any way?  <br/>\nWill the schools you are applying for know this?  About how long does <br/>\nit take to prep for the SAT if my kids don&#39;t have a whole lot of <br/>\nformal schooling?  It seems like it would take awhile to learn the <br/>\nmath particularly.  If you score poorly in one area (such as math), <br/>\nbut you do well in another area or areas, will that be okay with some <br/>\nschools or do they just look at the overall score?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI read on the Classical HS site, that most colleges require credits <br/>\nin a foreign language.  Will this be a problem for getting acceptance <br/>\ninto a state-level college?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about it last night in bed, and I realized that a part <br/>\nof me thinks it would be easier to have my kids sitting at home <br/>\nreading texts and books (this dream of them studying independently <br/>\nand doing workbooks) than it would be driving them around town to <br/>\nvarious places for volunteer work, helping them to dig for answers, <br/>\netc.  It may be the lazy part of me that wants the more traditional <br/>\nhomeschooling experience.  I also have aspirations.  I want to work <br/>\nout everyday.  Exercise is important to me and I haven&#39;t really been <br/>\nable to get it done for quite awhile.  It sometimes seems impossible <br/>\nto balance the things I would like to do and also satisfy the desires <br/>\nof my boys.  Everyday my youngest is wanting to go somewhere and <br/>\ncheck something out whether it be buying Pokemon cards or finding a <br/>\npalm tree that will grow where we live, or telling me he wants to <br/>\npaint on a canvas (all of these requests in the past 2 days).

Both of my boys (11 and 13) have told me that they want<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to go to college.  My oldest says he wants to become a zoologist or a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; veterinarian and since I have been unschooling him this year (with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the exception of math, which he does without much cajoling anyway),<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he has learned a ton about animals on his own.  I was pleasantly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; surprised and it is a great demonstration of how unschooling can work<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as far as how much my son has learned.  He particularly loves animal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; classification.  My younger son says he wants to become an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; engineer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am worried that if we don&#39;t do more structured learning, they will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not do well on their SATs.  BTW, we do not currently have a community<br/>\n&gt; &gt; college where we live.  I wonder if doing several hours of work with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; regard to spelling, vocabulary, and reading would boost SAT scores<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and help them get into a good college.  I hate to talk like that, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am just being honest about how I&#39;m thinking.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It seems like the SAT is the end-all be-all to what doors will be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; open to certain vocations.  Are there situations where they would be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; accepted without the high SAT score? Also, do they really need to go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to a &quot;Good&quot; top college in order to become a zoologist, engineer, or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; veterinarian?  They have such lofty goals it seems and my oldest is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; diagnosed on the autistic spectrum and so has additional struggles.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I understand how quickly time passes and it seems that they got older<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so quickly.  I wish I didn&#39;t feel I have to fret about their futures<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and vocations and could just relax about their learning.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I explained to my oldest son in particular about how important<br/>\n&gt; &gt; testing is if he wants to be accepted into a good school and he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seemed like he understood this and wants to work hard on academics to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; prepare for the SAT.  I felt guilty telling him this and wondered if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this were even the truth, but that is what I hear everywhere except<br/>\n&gt; &gt; here.  My mom also mentioned that many kids who do really well on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; SATs are still not getting into the &quot;Top&quot; colleges.  There are just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too many kids.  So he could work his fanny off, miss many joys and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pleasures and still not gain anything from it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would very much appreciate your thoughts about &quot;academics&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; college.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks, Beth<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!

And don&#39;t hold your breath <br/>\nwaiting for them to become zoologists or vets or engineers. Just help them <br/>\nbe that now, but don&#39;t be surprised if other ideas take their fancy. The <br/>\nworld is full of some pretty cool and amazing things to explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Beth Mouser&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mouser4@...\">mouser4@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, April 25, 2007 6:17 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] worry creeping back in<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi everybody,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry to be negative and questioning, but I am again struggling with<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.  Both of my boys (11 and 13) have told me that they want<br/>\n&gt; to go to college.  My oldest says he wants to become a zoologist or a<br/>\n&gt; veterinarian and since I have been unschooling him this year (with<br/>\n&gt; the exception of math, which he does without much cajoling anyway),<br/>\n&gt; he has learned a ton about animals on his own.  I was pleasantly<br/>\n&gt; surprised and it is a great demonstration of how unschooling can work<br/>\n&gt; as far as how much my son has learned.  He particularly loves animal<br/>\n&gt; classification.  My younger son says he wants to become an<br/>\n&gt; engineer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am worried that if we don&#39;t do more structured learning, they will<br/>\n&gt; not do well on their SATs.  BTW, we do not currently have a community<br/>\n&gt; college where we live.  I wonder if doing several hours of work with<br/>\n&gt; regard to spelling, vocabulary, and reading would boost SAT scores<br/>\n&gt; and help them get into a good college.  I hate to talk like that, but<br/>\n&gt; I am just being honest about how I&#39;m thinking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems like the SAT is the end-all be-all to what doors will be<br/>\n&gt; open to certain vocations.  Are there situations where they would be<br/>\n&gt; accepted without the high SAT score? Also, do they really need to go<br/>\n&gt; to a &quot;Good&quot; top college in order to become a zoologist, engineer, or<br/>\n&gt; veterinarian?  They have such lofty goals it seems and my oldest is<br/>\n&gt; diagnosed on the autistic spectrum and so has additional struggles.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I understand how quickly time passes and it seems that they got older<br/>\n&gt; so quickly.  I wish I didn&#39;t feel I have to fret about their futures<br/>\n&gt; and vocations and could just relax about their learning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I explained to my oldest son in particular about how important<br/>\n&gt; testing is if he wants to be accepted into a good school and he<br/>\n&gt; seemed like he understood this and wants to work hard on academics to<br/>\n&gt; prepare for the SAT.  I felt guilty telling him this and wondered if<br/>\n&gt; this were even the truth, but that is what I hear everywhere except<br/>\n&gt; here.  My mom also mentioned that many kids who do really well on<br/>\n&gt; SATs are still not getting into the &quot;Top&quot; colleges.  There are just<br/>\n&gt; too many kids.  So he could work his fanny off, miss many joys and<br/>\n&gt; pleasures and still not gain anything from it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would very much appreciate your thoughts about &quot;academics&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; college.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks, Beth<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
