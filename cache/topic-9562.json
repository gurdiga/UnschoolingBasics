Here is a blurb from the Fairhaven <br/>\nSchool web site (in Md) ...interesting how they compare themselves <br/>\nto unschoolers. Not that I&#39;m looking for anything to replace our <br/>\nunschooling which we&#39;ve only just begun, I was just shocked to see <br/>\nthat this type of school really existed (as it is what I had dreamed <br/>\nup as a perfect type of school).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fairhavenschool.com/articles_sortoflike.html\">http://www.fairhavenschool.com/articles_sortoflike.html</a><br/>\n. . . Homeschooling?<br/>\nThere is a particular philosophy of homeschooling, often referred to <br/>\nas &quot;unschooling,&quot; which shares many similarities with the Sudbury <br/>\nmodel. John Holt was its best known proponent, and his writings have <br/>\nbeen invaluable to us in helping to explain just how learning can <br/>\nhappen without teaching, and why on earth a child might choose to <br/>\nlearn arithmetic or some other supposedly dreadful subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers believe, as we do, that children are born curious about <br/>\nthe world and eager to succeed in life and that kids learn best <br/>\nthrough experience and experimentation rather than by being told how <br/>\nand what to think. In the words of John Holt: &quot;Real learning is a <br/>\nprocess of discovery, and if we want it to happen, we must create <br/>\nthe kinds of conditions in which discoveries are made. . . They <br/>\ninclude time, freedom, and a lack of pressure.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unschoolers, for the most part, see the family environment as <br/>\nthe best place for children to grow, while the Sudbury model <br/>\nbelieves that, as the African proverb states, &quot;It takes a village to <br/>\nraise a child.&quot; Children and parents have complex relationships and <br/>\ninterdependencies which make it harder for children to discover true <br/>\nindependence within the family. In the environment of a Sudbury <br/>\nschool, children face direct personal responsibility for their <br/>\nactions, without the emotional baggage that family-based <br/>\naccountability can sometimes carry. In addition, children are more <br/>\nable to develop some important social skills in a democratic school <br/>\nthe ability to tolerate diversity of opinion, to speak out against <br/>\ninappropriate behavior, and to develop and carry out group projects, <br/>\nfor example. In most homeschooling families, the parent sees him or <br/>\nherself as ultimately responsible for the child&#39;s education, while <br/>\nat Sudbury schools, that responsibility rests squarely with the <br/>\nchild.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!

Here is a blurb from the Fairhaven <br/>\nSchool web site (in Md) ...interesting how they compare themselves <br/>\nto unschoolers. Not that I&#39;m looking for anything to replace our <br/>\nunschooling which we&#39;ve only just begun, I was just shocked to see <br/>\nthat this type of school really existed (as it is what I had dreamed <br/>\nup as a perfect type of school).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fairhavenschool.com/articles_sortoflike.html\">http://www.fairhavenschool.com/articles_sortoflike.html</a><br/>\n. . . Homeschooling?<br/>\nThere is a particular philosophy of homeschooling, often referred to <br/>\nas &quot;unschooling,&quot; which shares many similarities with the Sudbury <br/>\nmodel. John Holt was its best known proponent, and his writings have <br/>\nbeen invaluable to us in helping to explain just how learning can <br/>\nhappen without teaching, and why on earth a child might choose to <br/>\nlearn arithmetic or some other supposedly dreadful subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers believe, as we do, that children are born curious about <br/>\nthe world and eager to succeed in life and that kids learn best <br/>\nthrough experience and experimentation rather than by being told how <br/>\nand what to think. In the words of John Holt: &quot;Real learning is a <br/>\nprocess of discovery, and if we want it to happen, we must create <br/>\nthe kinds of conditions in which discoveries are made. . . They <br/>\ninclude time, freedom, and a lack of pressure.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unschoolers, for the most part, see the family environment as <br/>\nthe best place for children to grow, while the Sudbury model <br/>\nbelieves that, as the African proverb states, &quot;It takes a village to <br/>\nraise a child.&quot; Children and parents have complex relationships and <br/>\ninterdependencies which make it harder for children to discover true <br/>\nindependence within the family. In the environment of a Sudbury <br/>\nschool, children face direct personal responsibility for their <br/>\nactions, without the emotional baggage that family-based <br/>\naccountability can sometimes carry. In addition, children are more <br/>\nable to develop some important social skills in a democratic school <br/>\nthe ability to tolerate diversity of opinion, to speak out against <br/>\ninappropriate behavior, and to develop and carry out group projects, <br/>\nfor example. In most homeschooling families, the parent sees him or <br/>\nherself as ultimately responsible for the child&#39;s education, while <br/>\nat Sudbury schools, that responsibility rests squarely with the <br/>\nchild.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9616,"nextTopicId":9626}}
