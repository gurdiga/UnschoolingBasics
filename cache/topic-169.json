He simply points it out to you and allows you the <br/>\nfreedom to put as much attention and effort into that piece as you <br/>\nchoose. He doesn&#39;t tell you that he will show you the next piece if <br/>\nyou say &quot;please&quot; or tell you that you don&#39;t get to see the next <br/>\npiece because you didn&#39;t say &quot;thank you&quot; when he showed you the <br/>\nprior piece.

All this from browsing through Vogue in line at <br/>\nthe grocery store.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if any of your daughter&#39;s interests open the door to a &quot;field <br/>\ntrip&quot; go for it!  It&#39;s terrific fun to get out and hit museums or <br/>\nbusinesses while the rest of the world is at school or work.  Having <br/>\nthe place to yourself is great.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrainstorming - that&#39;s the ticket.

I&#39;d warn you off <br/>\nof overdoing it - she may want to &quot;play&quot; Egypt, but not be interested <br/>\nin reading about Egypt, for example. There are GREAT activity books on <br/>\nancient civilizations - with cool ideas in them- building a pyramid out <br/>\nof sugar cubes, making a Senet game of your own, my friend and her kids <br/>\neven mummified a chicken once - went through the whole process. Every <br/>\nkid is different, maybe yours would get all excited over reading a <br/>\nnonfiction book about Egypt. But there are also stories - the &quot;Egyptian <br/>\nCinderella,&quot; is one.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT - don&#39;t get too excited that she&#39;s interested in something that is <br/>\nclearly &quot;educational&quot; and go overboard in supporting that interest over <br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy girls were very wrapped up in &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; for about a year. If <br/>\nyou&#39;ve seen it, you can probably imagine that most people probably <br/>\ndon&#39;t think of that as &quot;educational.&quot; But I supported that interest and <br/>\nwe taped the show EVERY day so they wouldn&#39;t miss it and we went to the <br/>\nanime store at the mall over and over so they could browse through all <br/>\nthe merchandise and an unschooling friend ran into a huge supply of <br/>\nSailor Moon dolls, posters, paper plates, and all kinds of things on <br/>\nsale and packed them up in a box and mailed them to us. Some of the <br/>\nthings the kids learned from all that focus on Sailor Moon were obvious <br/>\nones - they wanted to buy related things, so there was a lot of money <br/>\ncounting and sales tax adding and budgeting of allowances involved, for <br/>\nexample. But, there were MANY other things they learned - they spent <br/>\nENDLESS hours discussing the behavior of the characters - who did what <br/>\nand why and was it right or wrong and so on. And, if nothing else, it <br/>\nwas a passion that three sisters had in common - three kids who <br/>\notherwise had very very different interests. I&#39;m sure there was <br/>\nsomething wonderful and empowering for the girls, too, in watching the <br/>\nrather &quot;silly&quot; young girls turn into superpowered &quot;Sailor Scouts.&quot; In <br/>\nfact, it was incredible how many connections they made, all the time, <br/>\nof things that happened in their lives. My youngest daughter even got <br/>\nan interest in Japanese and (here is an unschooling mom&#39;s role in <br/>\naction) I had a friend whose kids went to a Japanese language school <br/>\nand I found out that their summer program was more of an introduction <br/>\nto the culture and language - doing fun activities like calligraphy and <br/>\npapermaking and sushi making, along with learning the basics of the <br/>\nlanguage. So my daughter spent a summer doing that. But that is just <br/>\nthe most obvious &quot;educational&quot; thing that came out of it - the point is <br/>\nthat you just never know how one thing is going to lead to another.<br/>\n<br/>\nSupporting a passion for Sailor Moon was a good exercise for me, as an <br/>\nunschooling parent because at first it was a bit difficult to not be <br/>\nirritated by the show - it didn&#39;t have obvious redeeming value and the <br/>\nsound of it tends to be very hard on my ears.

The easy quick answer is that the <br/>\nparents&#39; role varies depending on the child (and on the parent).  I <br/>\nthink &quot;pretty much the same for all unschoolers&quot; would be a very <br/>\nmisleading answer. My role isn&#39;t the same even for my three kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I bet there are some general principles that all unschoolers <br/>\nabide by and maybe together we can come up with a useful list.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the role of the unschooling parent?<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Show respect for all of a child&#39;s interests equally.<br/>\n2. Keep the child in mind as I go through life, so that I notice things <br/>\nthat might be of interest to that child.<br/>\n3. Find ways to include the child in my own daily life - live a more <br/>\n&quot;open-book&quot; life than the norm.<br/>\n4. Follow up on things the child is interested in - and do this in a <br/>\nwide variety of ways, not only by &quot;getting him a book on it.&quot;<br/>\n5. Live a family life that is rich with experiences of a variety of <br/>\nkinds both at home and outside the home.<br/>\n6. Have resources around the home that are interesting and stimulating <br/>\n- things that will encourage exploration of ideas.<br/>\n7. Discuss things - spend time in conversation. This is probably <br/>\noverall the most important parental &quot;action&quot; involved in unschooling.<br/>\n8. Have a &#39;playful&#39; attitude - play together, have fun, appreciate the <br/>\namazing world around you. Don&#39;t be cynical, be able to be amazed and <br/>\nfind the world a fascinating place. THIS is the most important <br/>\n&quot;attitude&quot; for an unschooling parent.<br/>\n9. Be self-aware of your own thinking and behavior. Purposely stretch <br/>\nyour imagination - question your own assumptions, check your own <br/>\nautomatic impulses.<br/>\n10. Be very observant of what your child is really doing - don&#39;t view <br/>\nhim/her in a shallow superficial way. Recognize that there is a reason <br/>\nfor a child&#39;s actions, that a child is &#39;born to learn&#39; and is always <br/>\nlearning. Get to know your child&#39;s own special favored ways of learning<br/>\n11. Wholeheartedly support a child&#39;s passions EVEN if, to you, they <br/>\ndon&#39;t look like &quot;education.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Intro & Question","postDate":"1086183834","msgId":204,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkMy4yMjhkNTU3NC4yZGVmMzM5YUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":203,"nextInTopic":207,"prevInTime":203,"nextInTime":205,"topicId":169,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/2/2004 9:03:42 AM Eastern Daylight Time, salgenovese@worldnet.att.net writes: In other  words, how do you generally go about digging up","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1329999415\">\n<html><head>\n \n</head> \n\n<font id=\"ygrps-yiv-1329999415role_document\"\n face=\"Arial\" color=\"#000000\" size=\"2\">\n<div>In a message dated 6/2/2004 9:03:42 AM Eastern Daylight Time, \nsalgenovese@... writes:</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:blue 2px solid;\"><font\n style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;\" face=\"Arial\" color=\"#000000\" size=\"2\">In other \n  words, how do you generally go<br>about digging up possible resources that \n  your kids might be interested in<br>for things they&#39;ve expressed interest in, \n  or thinking up ways they might<br>enjoy expanding those interests.&nbsp; And \n  how much do you leave up to them?&nbsp; Is<br>this something that has varied \n  over your years of unschooling with insight<br>you have gained in the process \n  of unschooling?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</font></blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>I know I&#39;ve gotten better at it----just because the more&nbsp;I DO it, the \nbetter/easier it gets!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The library and the computer (google) are invaluable.

When interests come, they rise to the <br/>\nsurface for me, and I suddenly notice things I wouldn&#39;t have before.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I would purposely look for a mummy game, but something <br/>\nusually comes across my path that I might consider getting.  Usually <br/>\nat the thrift store.<br/>\nIf questions about mummies came up, in the day, I would look for <br/>\ncool web sites, I would probably remember the next time we were at <br/>\nthe library to try to find some books that looked fun and <br/>\ninteresting about mummies.  I would probably notice &quot;The Mummy&quot; in <br/>\nthe video store and think about renting it.   <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t do all that in a week.  It happens over time.  If I did <br/>\ndo all that in a week, I think my child would think I had some <br/>\nvested interest in getting them to learn about mummies.<br/>\nIf we were going on a trip to Ireland, I would probably get all <br/>\nkinds of information in a weeks time, because I really would have a <br/>\nvested interest in learning about the country in a short time span, <br/>\nbut with mummies or anything, we have our whole life.<br/>\nMy dd Carly whose 13 has been interested in presidents and first <br/>\nladies since she was 7.  I still come across stuff that I think <br/>\nmight interest her.

It could be that as a beginner I don&#39;t quite get the<br/>\nphilosophy of many unschoolers - which is why I&#39;m on this list, to increase<br/>\nmy understanding - but what I am wondering is what you or other more<br/>\nexperienced homeschoolers think of as your role in terms of facilitating<br/>\nlearning for your kid(s) and is that pretty much the same for all<br/>\nunschoolers or does it differ.  In other words, how do you generally go<br/>\nabout digging up possible resources that your kids might be interested in<br/>\nfor things they&#39;ve expressed interest in, or thinking up ways they might<br/>\nenjoy expanding those interests.  And how much do you leave up to them?  Is<br/>\nthis something that has varied over your years of unschooling with insight<br/>\nyou have gained in the process of unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask because, as someone new to this, I wonder how to gauge if I am doing<br/>\ntoo much, not enough, or if there are different ways out there that other<br/>\nunschoolers use to help their children further their interests that I&#39;m not<br/>\naware of.  So when my 5 1/2 yr old daughter for instance gets interested in<br/>\nmummies and ancient Egypt, she has many wonderful ways in which she &quot;learns&quot;<br/>\nabout that - she asks me to cut up old sheets into strips so she can figure<br/>\nout how to wrap herself up like one, she takes some construction paper and<br/>\nstring and pencil and comes up with her own &quot;mummy game&quot; that we play over<br/>\nand over.  My tendency would be to look for books and videos from the<br/>\nlibrary at her level on mummies and Egypt that she might be interested in<br/>\n(or not, it&#39;s up to her).  I might find a game in the store where she gets a<br/>\npretend mummy to take the organs out of and wrap up, and may look for a<br/>\nwebsite with games or info on Egypt and mummies.
