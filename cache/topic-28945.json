I<br/>\nneed to show him  &#39;evidence&#39; of learning, i.e. test scores, in the <br/>\nschool<br/>\nsubjects.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYour child is old enough to understand that he may need to &quot;play the <br/>\ngame&quot; of testing to satisfy his father&#39;s need for testing---IF it comes <br/>\nto that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think if you can just start translating what he&#39;s doing into a <br/>\nportfolio of learning---a narrative is especially reassuring---the ex <br/>\nwill be satisfied with a weekly/monthly description of his learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I didn&#39;t see you list was Discussion. The majority of my <br/>\nboys&#39; learning is through conversations with me, their dad, friends, <br/>\nand each other. When they actually ask a question, they are &quot;in the <br/>\nmoment&quot; of discovery: they WANT that knowledge, so they&#39;re very <br/>\nreceptive to learning. That discussion/conversation time is a HUGE part <br/>\nof our learning here. I write down things we discuss, and you&#39;d be <br/>\nsurprised at how many things are learned in small two-three minute <br/>\nbites of time throughout the day. Commercials are a big source of <br/>\ndiscussion. Sit-coms too. Movies (and Tivo!) allow for a lot of <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest suggestion is to dedicate a week to write down everything <br/>\nyou witness (and things he will come to you about later). Write it all <br/>\ndown as if you HAD to document. Soon you will see how much he does do. <br/>\nIt will also allow you to eventually write down &quot;WOW&quot; in your notebook <br/>\nas shorthand for *ALL* the things that he&#39;s learning while playing (I <br/>\ndo this with &quot;Bionicles&quot;---which denotes building (math & physics), <br/>\nrole-playing (drama), storytelling (composition), design (art), <br/>\ncooperation (with a friend) (social skills), and buying new Bionicles <br/>\n(economics).)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo---starting when he wakes up, write down everything he does today. <br/>\nQuit looking at it as &quot;just play&quot; and start seeing teh actual learning <br/>\nthat is happening. You&#39;ll be amazed at what all he&#39;s learning. Add it <br/>\nup over a week, and you&#39;ll be flabbergasted!<br/>\n<br/>\nWeekly reports to his dad may look so impressive that he no longer <br/>\nneeds test scores. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMore new features than ever.
