That is the joy of Unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m an 18 year old longtime Unschooler, and it was always hard for my family when my sister (16) and I were younger, since pretty much everyone we knew was very school-at-home, and thought we were crazy to be Unschooling!  So I want to create something that wasn&#39;t there for my family when I was young, but would have made things so much easier for us!  What I want to do is bring together a supportive, caring group of Unschooling families, families who are seriously considering Unschooling, and those passionate about Unschooling, who can validate each others choices, share experiences, and just enjoy each others company!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this sounds as great to you as it does to me (or even if it just interests you) please check out this Yahoo! Group for a bit more information on the support group, and if you&#39;re interested in being part of this, please join! <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmontreal/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmontreal/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nStill have questions?
