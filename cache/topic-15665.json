The child who chooses to live their life in a way that <br/>\nseems in opposition to the way the parent would choose, the family would choose, <br/>\nis a greater charge than simply pointing out that the Emperor has no clothes. <br/>\nAlthough Terry Pratchett does a funny little paragraph in Thief of Time on how <br/>\nthe story was also about the boy who went home in serious trouble for getting <br/>\nhis family noticed in a not very good light by the royals. So maybe the <br/>\nEmperor&#39;s lack of clothes works. Just if you imagine the fallout that comes from <br/>\npointing out that lie to everyone who backed the lie. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes there is a righteousness that can come with walking a different path. <br/>\nA sense that you have more and better information about the true way to live.

I think there is some truth in that. My father lives so fully in the <br/>\nmoment he isn&#39;t necessarily aware of what I&#39;m doing in relationship to what he <br/>\ndid. Although I&#39;m sure he talks a fair bit about it immediately after he and his <br/>\nwife visit.

So, all 4 or 6 people in that area were called <br/>\nto the front of the classroom for punishment, including my mom and <br/>\nmy aunt. They were lined up and told to hold out their hands for the <br/>\nruler. My aunt was somewhere midway in the line. When the ruler got <br/>\nto her, she stuck her hands behind her back and despite <br/>\nrepeated &quot;dire threats&quot;, refused to take the punishment. The <br/>\nteacher, furious, took her out to the principle (parenthetically <br/>\nsaving the rest of the lineup from the ruler). The teacher went back <br/>\nto class and the principle asked my aunt what happened. She <br/>\nexplained (she was innocent BTW) and the principle said &quot;Oh okay&quot; <br/>\nand had my aunt help her file some papers or something to kill some <br/>\ntime then sent her back to the classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Quote","postDate":"1152712914","msgId":15665,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5MnZjaStiOTBwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15667,"prevInTime":15664,"nextInTime":15666,"topicId":15665,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just saw this online, while doing some research.

It&#39;s from John<br/>\nHolt&#39;s &quot;Instead of Education&quot;:<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;Power cancels out moral rights and obligations. The slave has no<br/>\nmoral duty to his master. He has every moral right to dodge and escape<br/>\nthe whip if he can, any way he can. No one is morally obliged to hold<br/>\nstill for punishment. A ten-year-old, a proud, brave, stubborn child,<br/>\nof great character, helped me to see this. One day she refused to go<br/>\nto French class, which she (sensibly) hated. She sat at her desk<br/>\nreading, while I kept telling her to go. Finally I said that it was my<br/>\njob and my duty to make her go to French class, and that if I could<br/>\nnot get her to go any other way I would drag her there. She did not<br/>\nmove. I approached her desk, ready to carry out my threat. When I was<br/>\nabout three feet away she suddenly looked up, slammed the book shut,<br/>\nbanged it on the desk, stood up, and said, &#39;All right, I&#39;m going! But<br/>\nit&#39;s just brute force that is making me go, just brute force!&#39; She was<br/>\nright; that&#39;s all it was.&quot;<br/>\n--from Instead of Education <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46964,"nextTopicId":46991}}
