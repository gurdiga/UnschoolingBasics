What do I care<br/>\nabout other people&#39;s misconceptions and so called<br/>\nexpert opinions?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, publicity and politics are<br/>\nimportant matters; much of the homeschooling movement<br/>\nhas indeed been a political struggle.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust google the history of that homeschool legal<br/>\ndefense organization....<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is important to remember that the choices we make<br/>\nin carving alternative educational niches for our<br/>\nchildren is a political act and we are, whether we<br/>\nlike it or not, part of a movement that IS political<br/>\nin nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nI homeschool in protest of mainstream cultural values<br/>\nthat are amplified and exacerbated in a school<br/>\nsetting. I don&#39;t know that the call to homeschool<br/>\nwould be so strong if schools, in their current<br/>\nincarnation, weren&#39;t so opposite of my philosophy,<br/>\nincluding my political philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf public schools functioned as they ought to in a<br/>\ntrue democracy-which is to ensure a well-educated<br/>\npublic that is capable and empowered enough to shape<br/>\ngovernment in the ways most beneficial to the greatest<br/>\nnumber of people-then maybe we wouldn&#39;t be a nation<br/>\nplagued as we are with rampant corruption and<br/>\ncorporate influenceon public policy. The fact that<br/>\nschools produce more &quot;schooled&quot; people than &quot;educated&quot;<br/>\nones is a threat to the health of our country.<br/>\n<br/>\nI homeschool to provide my daughter with an education<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t believe she would receive in a<br/>\ntraditional setting-that I could afford, anyway. For<br/>\nme, homeschooling is a patriotic act.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is worth considering the fact that what we do<br/>\nsafegaurds an important right-one to educate as one<br/>\nsees fit-and to live by example for the sake of not<br/>\nonly our families, but other families as well. Many<br/>\npeople do not have this option on their radar-they<br/>\naccept the inevitablity that school is the only choice<br/>\nfor their children whether or not the local public<br/>\nschool is good and whether or not they have the cash<br/>\nto shell out to a more benign institution.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany more might feel empowered enough to follow our<br/>\nexample if they knew more about what homeschooling is<br/>\nall about. One sided perspectives in the media don&#39;t<br/>\nhelp this situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, therefore, that public opinion is important,<br/>\neven in the sensationalist guise of a silly on-line<br/>\nsurvey and that perhaps our voice is one that should<br/>\nbe heard in the context of a vigorous national debate<br/>\non education and educational reform.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer Irizarry<br/>\nFormer public school teacher &<br/>\nUnschooling mom</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling Vote","postDate":"1160749015","msgId":18152,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVBQjA0ODkxLTE2QjAtNDJCRC1BREYzLUQxRDcwM0Q2QUUwQ0Bjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDOEJDRTczNzdFRDgxMy1DODAtNkMyOEBXRUJNQUlMLU1DMTcuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDAwMjQwMWM2ZWUwZCRjMDRlOTljMCQwYTAxYThjMEB0aWJlcml1bT4gPDY4NWIyZjIwNjEwMTMwNjAzbTM2ZmFkZTNieWQ5MTEzMmMxYmMxYTk0ZUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDhDOEJDRTczNzdFRDgxMy1DODAtNkMyOEBXRUJNQUlMLU1DMTcuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":18151,"nextInTopic":18207,"prevInTime":18151,"nextInTime":18153,"topicId":18126,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You know, I didn t even vote, I really dislike polls like that, because I couldn t decide between A or B.
