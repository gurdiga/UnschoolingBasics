I&#39;ll have to look into that, as he is a very active<br/>\nchild. That&#39;s one reason i&#39;ve always felt he wouldn&#39;t fare well in<br/>\npublic school. I don&#39;t like the idea of him being labeled ADD, or<br/>\nADHD, and people suggestioning i put him on medications. I suppose he<br/>\ndoes do that type of thing naturally, on his own, with the way he<br/>\nplays video games. The Mortal Kombat games are his thing. He has all<br/>\nof them ever made except a couple. He doesn&#39;t play the way a lot of<br/>\nkids do though. His only concern is being able to do every move, that<br/>\nevery charcter has. He puts the game on vs. mode so no one is fighting<br/>\nhim back and he just does the moves over and over. He probably has<br/>\nhundreds of special moves and finishing moves memorized. It always<br/>\namazes us how he remembers every single one and can do it with<br/>\nperfection every time. Maybe that is meditative for him. I never<br/>\nthought about it til now. He can sit still for hours if he&#39;s playing<br/>\nMortal Kombat. He also has all the fighting stances memorized as well<br/>\nand walks around the house just rocking in a fighting stance quizing<br/>\nme on who&#39;s it is and what it&#39;s called. He also incorporates them into<br/>\nhis style of dancing when we are playing music.

I usually take the time at least every other day<br/>\nto catch up on reading the current posts within the groups. <br/>\nI already have the Starbright book. That&#39;s the one i already tried to<br/>\n use with ds7. I didn&#39;t mind changing some of the words that i didn&#39;t<br/>\nlike. For instance changing &quot;gaurdian angel&quot; to just &quot;gaurdian&quot;, or<br/>\n&quot;spirit guide&quot;. I may continue trying to work at it with him, but i<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to put any pressure. Really, part of the thing was, he<br/>\nwanted to read it to me. He did have trouble i could see, being still,<br/>\nand keeping his eyes closed. I didn&#39;t get onto him for it or anything<br/>\nand told him it would get easier with practice. And i told him the<br/>\npoint of the excersise was to help him feel more calm and centered,<br/>\nsafe etc.. I chose to try the first time when he was already pretty<br/>\ncalm. But after the intro he was figgitty and wanted to read them to<br/>\nme. I let him read me one, and the next time i asked him if he wanted<br/>\nto use the book together he politely declined my offer. I haven&#39;t<br/>\nreally brought it up again.<br/>\nI will look into the other book you mentioned as well. I also wanted<br/>\nto reccomend a book for anyone interested. I don&#39;t know if any of you<br/>\nhave read Wherever You Go, There You Are by Jon Kabat-Zinn, but it&#39;s a<br/>\nwonderful book on cultivating mindfulness and meditation. I&#39;ve read it<br/>\ntwice, years apart, and still feel i could learn more by reading it a<br/>\nthird time. Recently i came across a parenting book written by him and<br/>\nhis wife, and i had to have it. It&#39;s titled Everyday Blessings, The<br/>\nInner Work of Mindful Parenting, by Myla and Jon Kabat-Zinn. I&#39;m still<br/>\nin the first third of the book, but so far i think it&#39;s great. If only<br/>\nit was easier to learn to incorporate everything we read. :P I&#39;ll let<br/>\nyou all in on the impressions i&#39;ve gathered when i get to the end as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nLilith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":229237531,"authorName":"Danielle Conger","from":"Danielle Conger &lt;danielle.conger@...&gt;","profile":"danielleconger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: intro with emotions out of control","postDate":"1155123853","msgId":16392,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ0RDlDQThELjYwMjA0MDBAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGViYTg1cSszazBoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGViYTg1cSszazBoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16387,"nextInTopic":16396,"prevInTime":16391,"nextInTime":16393,"topicId":16376,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I start with deep breathing, <br/>\nasking them to fill their lungs up with air like giant balloons to carry <br/>\nthem up into the sky, and then to breathe out, releasing all of their <br/>\nworries and fears. This breathing carries them up into the cloud fairy <br/>\nrealm, and I then tell them a story and use some guided imagery <br/>\ntechniques for happy dreaming. The girls, especially, really like the <br/>\nstories, and it&#39;s a great way to reconnect with the kids and share some <br/>\nmeditation techniques with them in a low-key way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were younger, I did a lot of dancing with them and blowing <br/>\nbubbles as ways to focus on breathing and relaxation.

Keeping in mind, however, that <br/>\nmeditation can occur in lots of ways throughout the day can be helpful <br/>\nin trying to carve out that &quot;me&quot; time with the kiddos around. Walking <br/>\nmeditation can be really useful if you can get the kiddos out the door. <br/>\nFinding ways to be mindful in your daily activities can also be a form <br/>\nof meditation, helping to keep you focused and grounded.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that&#39;s helpful.

Someone once told me on a<br/>\nmessage board that if i have to repeat myself constantly then i must<br/>\nnot be listening to the children well enough, and/or not saying the<br/>\nright things. Essentially that i was the one not getting it. I can see<br/>\nsome truth in that, but i don&#39;t feel it is the whole truth. I have<br/>\nbeen making strong efforts to listen to the children better and still<br/>\nrepeat myself a lot. But i guess that&#39;s okay.

I used to<br/>\nmeditate quite a bit when they were younger, and somehow over time<br/>\nfell out of it. I tell myself a lot that i need to find a way to set<br/>\naside the &quot;me&quot; time every day to breathe and get my thoughts organized<br/>\nand viewed objectively. It hadn&#39;t occured to me that it might help for<br/>\nme to be the example that might spark more interest for them over<br/>\ntime. Seems obvious now that you mentioned it.

I have been homeschooling my oldest since he was 4yrs. and<br/>\nrecently(within the past 4mths.) have began incorporating radical<br/>\nunschooling ideas into our household. I have been trying my hardest to<br/>\nlet go of the control on my children, and show them and their<br/>\nbelongings respect. We have stopped the use of punishment. Overall we<br/>\nhave changed a lot about the way we do things. We have been having<br/>\nproblems with getting the kids to understand that they can&#39;t control<br/>\nother people, and they only have the choices to control themselves.<br/>\nTheir is a lot of fighting going on between them, and they hit each<br/>\nother when the other doesn&#39;t conform to their wants. I feel like i&#39;m<br/>\nexplaining the same things over and over again to them, and that they<br/>\naren&#39;t understanding why it&#39;s not right to be physical with someone<br/>\njust because you don&#39;t like their actions. I have told them that the<br/>\nways we were doing things before (time outs, and spankings) weren&#39;t<br/>\nright, and that i realize i&#39;ve made mistakes with them, and have<br/>\napologized for hurting them and not showing them respect in the past.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had this talk several times. We&#39;ve also offered other choices<br/>\nfor how to resolve problems and outlet anger in healthy ways. I&#39;ve<br/>\ntalked to them about talking feelings and situations out and learning<br/>\nto compromise, also offered them that if they feel like they need to<br/>\nhit to let out their feelings thay can hit their pillows and throw<br/>\nstuffed animals in their room. With my oldest i have offered to do<br/>\nchildren&#39;s meditations with him, and after doing the first one he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to. My oldest seems to understand better than the 5yr.<br/>\nold, but still hits his brother anyway. I&#39;m obviously not handling the<br/>\nconflicts properly, but don&#39;t understand what i am doing wrong. I have<br/>\na lot of questions about things that seem unclear to me. They seem<br/>\nunable to respect my space and my choices, and i realize this will<br/>\ntake time, but the real problem is the way they act when someone,(me<br/>\nor each other) doesn&#39;t do exactly what they want. DS5 has started<br/>\nthrowing things at me and hitting me when i don&#39;t do what he wants,<br/>\nand i have had to restrain him to keep him from hurting me. I know<br/>\nrestraint can&#39;t be the right answer but i don&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>\n He completely losses control of himself, screaming and not listening<br/>\nto me trying to reason with him. I try validating his feelings<br/>\nverbally even if i&#39;m not going to do what he wants, but this isn&#39;t<br/>\nenough. I also explain why i&#39;m making the choice i am, but that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to matter either. Then he resorts to violence because i<br/>\nam trying to talk to him instead of just giving in. Also i feel that<br/>\nif i tell him i won&#39;t do something it would show me to be inconsistent<br/>\nto change my mind because of his actions. As am example, this happened<br/>\nearlier. I was sitting in a chair in the living room rocking the baby<br/>\nbecause he was being fussy, and DS5 said he wanted me to go get him<br/>\nhis soda from the kitchen. I told him i wasn&#39;t going to get it for him<br/>\n at the moment because i was rocking the baby, and that he could get<br/>\nit himself. He started on the &quot;i don&#39;t want to, i want you to do it,&quot;<br/>\nbit and i just tried to reason with him about it. He was saying he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to get it because he was tired, and i continued to explain<br/>\nthat he could have already gotton it himself in the time it was taking<br/>\nto aurgue with me. The conversation doesn&#39;t get very far before he&#39;s<br/>\nscreaming and threatening to throw a book at me if i don&#39;t do it.<br/>\nEventually i ended up having to put the baby down, because DS5 was out<br/>\nof control and trying to hurt me. It took me an hour to get him calmed<br/>\ndown. I&#39;m assuming he is acting out like this because he doesn&#39;t feel<br/>\nvalidated, or feels as though i&#39;m not listening to him, but i don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how to help him feel any more validated without just doing every<br/>\nlittle thing he wants me to. Which is him controling me.<br/>\nI can&#39;t just let him continue hurting me, or he and his brother<br/>\ncontinue hurting each other, but i&#39;m not sure how to stop it without<br/>\ninforcing control again. For instance, i felt it wasn&#39;t right for me<br/>\nto restrain him. But it was the only solution i saw at the time. It<br/>\nhurts me to see him so frustrated and upset, and i feel helpless that<br/>\ni can&#39;t help him deal with his emotions in a healthy way. I&#39;m sorry<br/>\nthis post is so much to read. I just wanted to try explaning well.<br/>\nThanks for any advice,<br/>\nLilith</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16330,"nextTopicId":16405}}
