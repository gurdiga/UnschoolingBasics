We don t socialise with any of my kid s friends from school anymore,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1978912959\">Hi Diane,<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We live in the middle of the school route (and we have 3 schools near us). We don&#39;t socialise with any of my kid&#39;s friends from school anymore, afterall he&#39;s only been to the 1st school for 1 yr( we kinda fell out of the social loop when we moved out of the village to get son into another school)  and because he was only in the 2nd school for only 1 term, we never had the chance to really make any new friends.  He is not part  of any local communitty activity groups like football or karate or scouts either because my son&#39;s not interested to be part of those groups too. It doesn&#39;;t bother my 7 yr old son at all.<br/>\n  We now have home-educating friends, all living within 10 - 15 miles away.  <br/>\n   Especially yesterday, me and hubby and son went trick and treating with another HEing 9 yr old friend. The kids&#39; didn&#39;t feel out of place at all, and had a fantastic time. <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  &quot;my kids did not care, did notice who was walking with who, they were just happy to be trick or treating. they have their friends they play with all the time , just<br/>\nnot the same ones in the neighborhood anymore. I am glad my kids are not part of<br/>\nit, because frankly the kids are snotty and rude, they don&#39;t know how<br/>\nto socialize with other kids not their exact same age. the ones that<br/>\nare 1 or 2 years older will not even acknowledge my kids if they say<br/>\nhi. I have said things to them in the past, but I don&#39;t like to point<br/>\nit out to my kids too much, because they don&#39;t seem to care or even<br/>\nnotice even though I do. They have their group of close friends, they<br/>\njust don&#39;t happen to live in our neighborhood.&quot; <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n    I find when children is being unschooled, they are usually very sure of thier identity, they seems so much more confident in themselves, and is very comfortable with the fact that they are different, simply because they don&#39;t go to school, and they are aware that they had a choice in doing things, differently from school.  I noticed in my son, that there isn&#39;t any competitive streak in him, simply because he didn&#39;t have to compete with anyone to stand out of the crowd, like in a classroom. Hence, it just doensn&#39;t bother him when everybody is doing this and that, and he&#39;s not. This is the case simply because he knows it was his preferance to be doing something different.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;any thoughts on this? any good things I can say to hubby when he says<br/>\nthings like this? &quot; I also told him he has to let go of those notions of what he thinks the kids &quot;should be doing&quot; .  He says it bothers him that they don&#39;t have the structure like school kids do. They don&#39;t have set bedtimes, or a set in stone schedule. he said he thinks this is wrong. any thoughts on how I can approach this without becoming defensive.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  This is how I said to my husband in the beginning, trying to convince him of us unschooling, tyring to get him to see sense, trying to get him to understand that our child is also equally deserving of all this freedom in choices that we adults make, evry minute and every hour of our life! <br/>\n   <br/>\n  1. How would you like it if I tell you that you have to go to bed everynight at 8 oclock, tv off, light off? <br/>\n  2. How would you like it if I tell you, you HAVE to go to sports events, or socialise with your workmates, everyday? <br/>\n  3.  If you feel our son needs to be part of the local community, how come you&#39;re not make any effort to be part of our community? I told my hubby, how would you like it if I told you, you have to go play football with our neighbours, evry weekend, whether you like it or not, how would you feel?<br/>\n  4. If he thinks son should be like other kids, doing the same thing, then perhaps I should be the same too, doing what other mothers are doing. So does this means I can have my brand new sports car, and go buy Â£1,000 Fendi handbags, because that&#39;s what most mothers I know, is doing!!! I think this trick help convinced my hubby the logic in doing things differently LOL!  My point is, just because that&#39;s what everybody is doing, doesn&#39;t mean we have to!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I felt, by placing my hubby in my son&#39;s shoes, it did help make hubby see how ridiculous and unfair it is to impose on our son, what he felt our son should be doing and how to behave. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Can you hubby see the difference in your kids? Can he see the positiveness in them unschooling? Can he see them being so happy, all the time? Can he, at least acknowledge that it is a fantastic thing when your chidlren is so confident in themselves, that they are not even bothered about not being in the crowd? Isn&#39;t this what&#39;s gonna help them when they grow up? The confidence to be themslevs and not be swayed by other people&#39;s ideas, I think this is very important, especially nowadays, chidlren is exposed to so much options and influences like drugs and all.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hope I&#39;m able to help. All the best. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sharon.<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n For ideas on reducing your carbon footprint visit Yahoo!
