She can be a<br/>\nkid again.  She can ask for assistance.  She can play &quot;baby games&quot;<br/>\nagain.  She can abandon that grown up kindergardener in favor of her<br/>\n&quot;childish youth.&quot;  I would see this more as healing than regressing.<br/>\nEven the short amount of time that she was in school can leave an<br/>\nimpact on who she feels she is!<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout Girl Scouts:  Be aware that  Girl Scouts aren&#39;t always<br/>\nunschooling friendly.  I was a Girl Scout my entire life and while I<br/>\nloved souts, I found that my daughters didn&#39;t.  While they enjoyed<br/>\nbeing with other girls, the structure of scouting and the drive to<br/>\nfinish badges and earn awards did not mesh well with them.  There is<br/>\nan emphasis on completing things and earning the next level award.<br/>\nEmily dropped out after her first year in Juniors because there was SO<br/>\nmuch stress on working towards their Bronze Award.  She saw the other<br/>\nBronze Award recipients&#39; work and felt she couldn&#39;t come up with as<br/>\ngood of a project.  Mary Elayne got frustrated with Brownies because<br/>\nshe would start the work on a badge and decide that she had learned<br/>\nall she wanted to on the badge and was ready to move on to something<br/>\nelse.  But because she didn&#39;t complete the badge she had nothing to<br/>\nshow (at least on her vest) for all that she had learned.  No badges<br/>\nfor half completed work.  Half completed work equated to not good<br/>\nenough.  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also important to remember that the majority of girls in scouting<br/>\nare traditionally schooled.  They bring with them all the issues that<br/>\ngo along with school.  Depending on how comfortable your child is with<br/>\nunschooling this may or may not be a problem.  There are homeschool<br/>\nGirl Scout troops that can be a bit better, but again most people are<br/>\nschooling at home (to some degree) and aren&#39;t living free, joyful and<br/>\nunschooled lives.  There are much better ways of finding socialization<br/>\nfor your child than scouting.  If your primary goal is socialization<br/>\nthat is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle - with a crazy mixed up view of scouting :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19009,"nextTopicId":18964}}
