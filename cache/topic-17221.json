I had never heard about it before. I looked through the photo gallery while I was there. What a group of sweet faced girls they are! I can see where caring for your sweet daughter would probably take many extra hours each day though. How fortunate that you have a program that both you and your daughter are enjoying and that&#39;s working well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;.....as it is, my older daughter gets her own individualized program at school,and it&#39;s tailored to exactly what she needs.

It won&#39;t look like school, but it will be exactly what she needs because that&#39;s what you&#39;ll make it. :o) If she&#39;s miserable in school, it&#39;s worth a try.

In our home the learning is centered around joy, exploration, activity, quiet times, contemplation....life. I&#39;m committed to living, but aren&#39;t we all? You CAN do this for your daughter.
