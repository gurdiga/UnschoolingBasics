Fear can&#39;t rule your life  <br/>\nthough....The good news is that you had preexisting moles that  <br/>\nturned, rather than the creation of new blemishes. That&#39;s very  <br/>\ncontrollable, and less likely to create skin cancer. Hm, that&#39;s odd  <br/>\ntoo because my friend maybe two years ago went thru the bloody moles,  <br/>\nand they removed them and said that the moles were benign, but the  <br/>\nsign of the changing was indicative of too much sun exposure (or  <br/>\nsomething like that)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about leaving it down on her level and just hoping that she&#39;ll  <br/>\nuse it? We have in our family Emily, who is very sensitive to  <br/>\nsunblock, the feel is slimy, the smell is strong. So she really has  <br/>\nto approach it on her own terms. She needs to be strong enough  <br/>\nemotionally and be in control of it, or she really can&#39;t handle it.  <br/>\nIt helps that she physically gags, before unschooling came into our  <br/>\nlives I probably would have ignored her more subtle ways of saying  <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t like it. As well, Sam and Dan are both two boys who need  <br/>\ncontrol. They do NOT like someone else in their space telling them  <br/>\nwhat to do. They have been unschooled a majority of their lives (or  <br/>\nat least, *I* have been more of an unschooler on restrictions and  <br/>\nsuch, even tho we started unschooling about nine months ago)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo leaving the sunblock and hats on the table by the door and saying  <br/>\n&quot;We&#39;re leaving soon, we&#39;ll be ready when everyone gets sunblock.&quot; Or  <br/>\nmaybe if you are very concerned about her medically, she doesn&#39;t want  <br/>\nsunblock, you don&#39;t go. It sounds very exciting to live right by all  <br/>\nthat water and fun sun, but maybe it&#39;s not important enough for her?  <br/>\nMaybe take her to the store and let her smell all the different  <br/>\nbrands and see if one is better. And I totally agree that she should  <br/>\nbe seeing EVERYONE put it on frequently. What about making it part of  <br/>\na routine? If you could bath her in the am, then have it be a lotion  <br/>\nthat she puts on. That gives her some protection for eight hours or  <br/>\nso (if not swimming of course).<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter saying &quot;May I put some sunblock on you?&quot; and if she says no,  <br/>\ni&#39;d ask if she wants to do it herself. If she says no again, I would  <br/>\nsay &quot;Would you let me know when it&#39;s okay to do it?&quot; and then wait.  <br/>\nYou could say sunblock is important to our family, and we&#39;ll leave  <br/>\nwhen it on, but that sounds controlling. But if it&#39;s medically  <br/>\nnecessary, that&#39;s better than manhandling her (and easier, sunblock  <br/>\nis slippery lol!)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, you&#39;re family has been through a lot with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On May 12, 2006, at 8:41 AM, Deb Lewis wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ***I feel like I&#39;m abusing her by not using the sunscreen and I  <br/>\n&gt; know I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; abusing<br/>\n&gt; her when we force her to wear it. ***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let it go.

Rather than working <br/>\nwith the doctors against Danny, I let the doctors be the bad guys, made <br/>\nthem be the ones to hold him down, and I just hugged and supported <br/>\nDanny.  Sometimes we made up &quot;mean&quot; songs about the doctors or the <br/>\nneedles.  Sometimes we hollered and made threatening faces.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to circumstances beyond our control, it was something that Danny <br/>\nreally needed to do for his health that he didn&#39;t understand because of <br/>\nhis age.  I wanted to not be mad at him for his anger but to be his <br/>\nally in handling his anger.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Pampered Chef Michelle","from":"&quot;Pampered Chef Michelle&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling and Forcing Kids to do Things They Clearly Don&#39;t Want To Do","postDate":"1147437106","msgId":12996,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA1MTIwNTMxaTE0ODE4MDdhazEyOWJhMGQ5MjAxODc5NWRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDI2Yi5hNGZlNjE2LjMxOTVkMzBkQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDI2Yi5hNGZlNjE2LjMxOTVkMzBkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":12993,"nextInTopic":12997,"prevInTime":12995,"nextInTime":12997,"topicId":12993,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That would be the first thing<br/>\nthat I would tackle.  It could be the smell, the way it feels on her skin,<br/>\nthe time it takes to put on, etc.  Find the reason behind it and you will<br/>\nfind the solution to helping her get the protection she needs.  Also, does<br/>\nshe see you putting on sunscreen?  Maybe have her do it with you.  Both of<br/>\nyou &quot;lather up&quot; each morning together.  My kids have just come to appreciate<br/>\nwearing a hat.  I never had a &quot;hat baby&quot; and all hats ended up on the floor<br/>\nwithin seconds of putting them on their heads.  In fact Emily hated hats so<br/>\nmuch that just 3 hours old she was squirming out of her stocking cap at the<br/>\nhospital.  She would push on them until they came off.  So I found other<br/>\nways to keep my kids protected from the sun.  They weren&#39;t as good as hats,<br/>\nbut they at least were something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2346607,"authorName":"ohpurple1@aol.com","from":"ohpurple1@...","profile":"openmindedfamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Unschooling and Forcing Kids to do Things They Clearly Don&#39;t Want To Do","postDate":"1147435277","msgId":12993,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2Yi5hNGZlNjE2LjMxOTVkMzBkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12996,"prevInTime":12992,"nextInTime":12994,"topicId":12993,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/12/2006 3:00:12 AM Eastern Standard Time, pamsoroosh@earthlink.net writes: bet that if you simply stop going out so much, don t have other","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2000615971\">In a message dated 5/12/2006 3:00:12 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a> writes:<br/>\nbet that if you simply stop going out so much, don&#39;t have other  <br/>\nkids over, and your husband doesn&#39;t &quot;handle&quot; her - constrain her,  <br/>\nmake her do things, etc., that she&#39;ll stop hitting within 6 months to  <br/>\na year.<br/>\nHow does one get a two and a half year old to willingly let her Mommy apply <br/>\nsunscreen or at least keep her hat on?  She won&#39;t let me without force and she <br/>\nrefuses to apply the stick herself.  I prefer the chemical free natural <br/>\nsunscreens which the rest of the family uses but for the resistant baby we&#39;ve tried <br/>\nall flavors, colors, scents, creams, solids, etc.  We&#39;ve called it makeup, <br/>\ncandy for her face and everything else we can think of.  I bought a full body red <br/>\nUV suit that goes over her clothes but she really does not like that.  I give <br/>\nher the choice of the suit or the cream and she screams and runs away.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy issues:<br/>\nOur family has sensitive, freckly skin (all strawberry blondes) and my 9 year <br/>\nold just had three atypical moles removed from her head leaving 28 stitches.  <br/>\nAtypical means that the cells were changing to cancer.  She had the moles for <br/>\nyears but they started getting dark around the edges and one had a bloody, <br/>\ncrusty center so they took them off.  She goes back in next month to have two <br/>\nmore removed.  We were told by the dermatologist and the surgeon that we should <br/>\nexpect to be doing these removals every couple of years at most and that our <br/>\nkids should all have annual body checks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the UV suits, and tons of other bells and whistle including wide <br/>\nbrimmed hats.  We also live in Cape Cod near the shore and have a heated pool that <br/>\nis already opened.  We love the beach so we often go later in the day, etc., <br/>\nbut we spend all day, all summer, in our pool.  We have a huge market umbrella <br/>\nthat was great last year when she was one and clung to me more but I know she <br/>\nwon&#39;t be clinging so much this year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I&#39;m abusing her by not using the sunscreen and I know I&#39;m abusing <br/>\nher when we force her to wear it.  My husband tried to scare her by telling <br/>\nher that she might have to go to the hospital if she doesn&#39;t wear it.  That&#39;s <br/>\nworse for me than holding her down to apply it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do others handle this?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nRobin, glad that there is no sun today.
