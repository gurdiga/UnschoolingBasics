I have read them in detail and all of them have made me think and reflect, which is truly a gift!<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep finding the &quot;big picture&quot; in little ways in life . . .I remember when I first heard about voluntary simplicity, for example, I would read various things (not even related to VS) and saw how the pieces of the puzzle all fit together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am finding the same is true with unschooling/parenting/LIVING.  I find that the reoccurring theme has been acceptance.  So many issues go back to this, be it re: my readings on Buddhism to improving my relationship to my spouse to understanding my children.  I came up with a definition for &quot;anger&quot; a few months ago-- sort of a wakeup call for me.  I found that anger is, essentially, being unable or unwilling to accept reality.  Once a person is able to accept reality, chances are that person would not be angry.  Disappointed or sad-- perhaps, but not angry.  Anyway, again . . . there is that theme of acceptance!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I am trying to work on accepting the way the house is.  I wasn&#39;t getting mad about it w/my children (though I was w/my spouse, but have been focusing on not expecting change) but I was still frustrated, and I think that overall attitude comes through.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like what someone wrote about how those little pieces of paper scattered on the floor are something that won&#39;t be there when my kids get older . . and that I should appreciate them as symbols of this time in their lives.  Very, very nice-- makes me teary to think of it, really.  It makes me look at a &quot;mess&quot; in a new kind of way.  I never want to just wish these times away with my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE the monkey platter idea . . .sort of like an obento for the whole family!

Is there a reason why y&#39;all can&#39;t move projects in and out of the playroom as needed? I realize it extends the mess to some degree but it can also be a quick fix in the moment: &quot;let&#39;s set up this project in the kitchen so I can tidy up the playroom.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I actually didn&#39;t take a lot on myself just &quot;because.&quot; Like many people in the current economy, we need the money, which is why I got a job.  We have looked at a million ways to save money, but there is a point where one simply needs more income. And the pregnancy- a surprise. And yes, everything has its place, everything is organized.  The only way to make it easier would be to get rid of most toys with little pieces, but how fair would that be? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re coming across a little defensive, here - I&#39;m sorry if *I* came across as something other than supportive! You seem to be facing a number of challenges at once, that&#39;s hard. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, it doesn&#39;t help to put your energy into ideas like &quot;the only way is...&quot;. It might help to shift to &quot;I can&#39;t see a better way yet&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m still looking for more options/solutions.&quot; Joyce and Faith had a lot of good suggestions for cleanup. Games with small pieces can sometimes be cleaned up with a dustpan more easily than individual bits - scooping legos with a dustpan was a trick I learned at my first unschooling conference! It can also be helpful to have one bin of just small parts to games (especially if one of your kids likes to mix up the parts! Mo loved that for awhile). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; And, they actually do like sitting down for a meal.  They prefer hot food.  What I&#39;ve noticed, too, is that for them, me getting food ready for them is part of how they want attention . . .in other words, they feel more &quot;cared for&quot; when I get them food.  For example, we have water ready/easy to get for them at all times, but somehow it&#39;s just more special for them if I get it.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I do in the winter, especially, is make large batches of things that can be reheated quickly, leftover-style, in the microwave. Even things like pancakes, which is a favorite of Mo&#39;s. That way hot food is super fast *and* its easy for kids to get their own food if they want. Mo will sometimes want a parent to get her food/drinks, but will often get it herself if we&#39;re both in the middle of something rather than wait. The microwave helps with that a lot. With younger kids, it may be helpful to dish out serving sizes of favorite foods in a microwave-safe dish so its all ready to go. If you&#39;re busy in the moment, an older child might be willing to help out by popping the dish in the microwave, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I am not upset that my DD does not usually put her laundry in the hamper. However, the fact remains, that someone has to find her dirty clothes and wash them.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************************<br/>\n<br/>\nI literally clean house with a laundry basket at the ready. Its much, much easier for me than the frustration of things not getting washed bc they didn&#39;t get in the hamper. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I DO expect my 7 yo to: bring her plate to the sink and put her laundry in the hamper.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************************<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she doesn&#39;t do those things regularly, than that&#39;s not a reasonable expectation. That&#39;s not meant as a criticism but a way to help you shift your perspective. Yes, your busy life would be muuuuuch easier if your children would be a little less child-like. It would be sooooo convenient if kids would act about ten years older than they are - not always, just now and then, when there are dishes to wash, for instance. But the fact remains that they are children, and pretty young children at that. Your 7yo seems very old to you, compared to your little ones, perhaps, and it can seem like she Should be ready to handle things that seem slight to you - but 7 is really very young still. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;It shouldn&#39;t come at the expense of nagging/complaining/etc., but scrounging for food, not being able to find what you want, not even being able to walk in a room because of a mess?  No, I don&#39;t think that helps anyone feel peaceful.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nBe careful about thinking in extremes. The options aren&#39;t spic-n-span on the one hand and utter disaster on the other. Maybe that&#39;s not what you meant, exactly, but you&#39;re phrasing a lot of comments in really strong either-or language. You seem to have a lot of emotion tied up in getting things done around the house and it may help to clarify your own thinking if you can step back a little and find out where its coming from. Some moms wrap up a lot of their issues with personal power in housework, for instance, or issues about feeling &quot;good enough&quot;. I&#39;m not saying either of those is the case for you, just that home making can be done without so much angst. Can you shift your perspective to something more joyful?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I have little routines built into the day that make things better . . .but I still have a long way to go, and as I said, it&#39;s only going to get harder, at least for a few years.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************************<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have some routines, that&#39;s good! Something that can help is to move away from negative expectations like &quot;I have a long way to go&quot; and &quot;its only going to get harder&quot; to more positve affirmations. &quot;I&#39;m giving my best every day&quot; for example. If you really do see nothing but hardship ahead, it may help to keep in mind that you always have choices. You have chosen to work, to give the gift of more income to your family. You could choose differently. You are choosing to have another child - again, you could choose differently. Plently of people are looking to adopt babies. You aren&#39;t &quot;stuck&quot; with the life you have, you can change it. Sometimes thinking about that can help you appreciate what you have - or help you change things you aren&#39;t so happy about. <br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, unschooling is about helping foster better relationships within families. Feeling stuck doesn&#39;t help you have a better relationship with your kids or husband. Trying to change other people doesn&#39;t help relationships. But often shifting your own perspective to something more forgiving, more open, more joyful! can go a long way to fostering more feelings of peace and harmony in the home. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269037874,"authorName":"kazglc","from":"&quot;kazglc&quot; &lt;kazzarat@...&gt;","profile":"kazglc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Making the transition","postDate":"1254260708","msgId":41680,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg5dHY1NCt1dmFnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg5cmVhMCtjcWx1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41676,"nextInTopic":41681,"prevInTime":41679,"nextInTime":41681,"topicId":41637,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you Ren for your words of wisdom - i will order the wherever you go book - i ve been looking to get something like that but not knowing what would be","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1751784287\">Thank you Ren for your words of wisdom - i will order the &#39;wherever you go&#39; book - i&#39;ve been looking to get something like that but not knowing what would be good as there is so many to choose from!<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Making the transition","postDate":"1254239067","msgId":41681,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlDNTYxOTg5N0FBRTQ3RjE5RjBBMUQ3MTdDNzNBQkQ2QExZTEFMQVAyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ1MUJGMEZCLTlGRUItNDRGMS05MjcwLUZCNEQ0NjMwNkIwNUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGg5czRpdStvcHBrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RDUxQkYwRkItOUZFQi00NEYxLTkyNzAtRkI0RDQ2MzA2QjA1QHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":41680,"nextInTopic":41683,"prevInTime":41680,"nextInTime":41682,"topicId":41637,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Once  <br/>\na day I travel through the house doing a 15 minute clean sweep. I have  <br/>\na 3000+ sqft house so usually it takee two! I have a laundry bin  <br/>\ndownstairs to the basement that I throw dirty laundry into.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wash at least one load per day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t follow a fly lady routine but I found a few things that work  <br/>\nfor us. I think cleaning in 15 minute incriments is perfect for mamas  <br/>\nof little kids. It might take a little for the to get use to it but  <br/>\nit&#39;s easy after y&#39;all get the hang of it.<br/>\nI use a timer and set it for 15 minutes and we (or I) clean like  <br/>\nmad :-) when the timer goes off I stop! And then play with the kids  <br/>\nagain. If it needs more cleaning I set a play timer and give the kids  <br/>\n15-30 minutes of undivided attention. On days when they need more I  <br/>\nclean less.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will occaisionally clean early in the AM before they wake.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about gathering toys that they would like to pass on to other  <br/>\nkids. My oldest finds this fun and easy. My middle has a harder time  <br/>\nbut still finds things he no longer loves. It makes room to enjoy the  <br/>\nthings he loves.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\nSent from my iPhone<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sep 29, 2009, at 1:05 AM, &quot;mizelenius&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mizelenius@...\">mizelenius@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Making the transition","postDate":"1254224426","msgId":41675,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzMTExNC45MTYxNi5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwOS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGg5czRpdStvcHBrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg5czRpdStvcHBrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41674,"nextInTopic":41676,"prevInTime":41674,"nextInTime":41676,"topicId":41637,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can t help much with cleaning.

I do pick up as I go and move through. It helped a lot when Simon and Linnaea were younger to look at their messes as stories about their day. When I&#39;d go through the DVDs and put them back in the right cases I was seeing the path they&#39;d taken from one movie to another over the course of days or weeks. And I could touch those moments in my memory of snuggling with them of laughing at the Pink Panther, of Simon&#39;s sweaty head as he fell asleep in my arms. I learned to love putting things out. Setting the stage for a moment of discovery or play as I lay out their action figures and animals and soft toys in some elaborate scene, maybe sneaking over the antlers we found at Raby Castle grounds or climbing a block tower that I built. Or of finding that picture that Linnaea had drawn that she was so proud of that she showed David and me and I wrote notes on the back to explain to our later selves and<br/>\n that had then gotten buried in the mountain of later works and paper clippings and could have so easily been gone forever if it weren&#39;t for my care. It took a lot to see each mess as an opportunity for me and each clean space as a blank canvas for them to work from (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/chores/shift\">http://sandradodd.com/chores/shift</a> third entry down). <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t clean to keep a clean space, I clean to create a space to play in. And from what you&#39;ve written that clearly is the case for you as well. You want to give them the freedom to play in a clean room by having fewer things to play with. I think Meredith&#39;s mention of using a snow shovel as a dustpan is pa wonderful picture. It also is a demonstration of how to approach cleaning.  Cleaning and clearing can, often, be done quickly and bluntly. If a room is inaccessible because of mess, come up with ways to clean it less thoroughly to make it at least accessible. I get stuck with wanting to clear up all the minutia and keep it ordered. David, my husband, is much better at piling things up and out of the way to be dealt with when someone has more moments to deal with them. Often that isn&#39;t for a long, long time. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I said I didn&#39;t have much to help with a cleaning perspective...<br/>\n<br/>\nFood I can talk about. I love food. I love feeding Simon and Linnaea. I absolutely agree that fixing food is an act of love. At its most basic it&#39;s a fact of parenting. But when you take the 5 or 10 minutes to put together a monkey platter (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com/monkeyplatters/)\">http://www.sandradodd.com/monkeyplatters/)</a> or when you take the 25 minutes total of prep time to make a loaf of challah which you get to later slice and butter and put before a hungry boy or when you go the grocery store and you find grapes to freeze and radishes to carve into smiley faced mushrooms or apples to make bunnies out of or when you open a package from the U.S. with cheetos in it, those are absolutely gifts of love. Simon and Linnaea love the care of being fed. Simon often asks for things that he could get himself simply because being cared for in that minute is special for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid and I cook together most evenings. We cook mainly because he and I like a main meal. Simon and Linnaea don&#39;t mind so much. And for much of their lives, although as they are growing it is lessening, we&#39;ve made 3 meals an evening. David and I want one thing and each of them want another. It doesn&#39;t add that much work and it means that no one has ever had to sit feeling the misery that I can oh, so clearly remember experiencing as I sat alone at the dinner table looking at congealing food that I didn&#39;t want when it was warm. Sometimes what they want isn&#39;t a full meal. Sometimes they want a full meal at 4 but not at 6. Being flexible is really important. Last night we had chip butties, chips, baked beans and mushy peas, a very British meal. Simon had spaghetti threaded hot dogs to start and finished with a chip butty (a french fry and buttered bread sandwich), Linnaea had baked beans and chips (french fries) and David and I had mushy peas (marrowfat<br/>\n peas that have been mashed up) and chips covered in green chile and cheese. 3 different meals. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of can&#39;ts and don&#39;ts and won&#39;t works in your response.<br/>\nIt is so easy to get stuck seeing no solution. You even are expecting<br/>\nit to get worse: &quot;I have little routines built into the day that make<br/>\nthings better . .<br/>\n.but I still have a long way to go, and as I said, it&#39;s only going to<br/>\nget harder, at least for a few years.&quot; That&#39;s a lot of stress and<br/>\ntension on your shoulders. Try not to look ahead. Try to go one moment<br/>\nat a time. Try to know that for each of them this is the only this<br/>\nmoment you get to share. Simon and Linnaea are 12 and 9 and already<br/>\nthey are doing so much without me. I get so much more time to myself,<br/>\nif I choose it, than I ever imagined I would have when Linnaea was 2<br/>\nand Simon was 5. They always welcome me into whatever they are doing<br/>\nbut they don&#39;t need me anymore. I miss the needing me. And it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nseem fair that the period of intense need is all piled up, all of your<br/>\nchildren all at once, and then it dissapates as they age, as they are<br/>\nall aging at the same rate, growing, moving on from that need. Stop,<br/>\nevery once in a while, a lot if you can, and relish it. Look at each child and each mess and each cut piece of paper as something that won&#39;t come around again. It will flow and move and change and you get right now, only right now with this. It is so very precious. Don&#39;t hope for few years from now, this could be the best time of your life, even if it overwhelms and stretches you to almost breaking.

Your reminder  <br/>\nis probably annoying her because she knows. But knowing and being  <br/>\nable to do are two separate things. As she&#39;s taking off her clothes  <br/>\nshe thinking about something else. That&#39;s the way brains work. At 7  <br/>\nthe future prospects of not  having clothes just don&#39;t loom large  <br/>\nenough to intrude on her thoughts. Accept that. Your reminders are  <br/>\njust telling her she&#39;s broken and wrong and needs to fix herself. But  <br/>\nshe&#39;s perfectly normal. Age will take care of it but there&#39;s no  <br/>\nguarantee at what age she&#39;ll be capable of that awareness.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Expectations are not a bad thing, I don&#39;t think, when there is a  <br/>\n&gt; choice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Expectations can set kids up to fail. They can increase the tension  <br/>\nin the atmosphere of the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter to think in terms of helping them, being their partner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s like with her piano lessons . . .she chose to take them. But,  <br/>\n&gt; her teacher expects her to practice. I expect her to practice, too,  <br/>\n&gt; since the money for them isn&#39;t easily found. At ANY point she can  <br/>\n&gt; stop taking lessons, though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If she&#39;s having fun I wouldn&#39;t muck with it, *BUT* in terms of  <br/>\nunschooling, it&#39;s better to see the point of lessons as a child  <br/>\ntrying something out, exploring, having fun rather than progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s absolutely value in the notion that if people work past the  <br/>\nrough parts and get better that they can have fun with the skill. But  <br/>\nparents and teachers can get so focused on working towards better and  <br/>\nthe future fun that they crush the current enjoyment. The child then  <br/>\nequates the pressure to practice and get better with the instrument  <br/>\nand gets turned off.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter in terms of life learning to have a little taste that was fun  <br/>\nthan pressure to be better.

It&#39;s better to have  <br/>\na little taste that wasn&#39;t fun with the child choosing to stop than  <br/>\npressure past the unfun part to a future that we can&#39;t know is better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also notice that my children prefer it when things are organized.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely for many kids. Kids can&#39;t appreciate the benefits of clean  <br/>\nunless they experience clean. They can&#39;t decide it&#39;s worth the effort  <br/>\nto straighten up if they haven&#39;t experienced a lot of both so they  <br/>\ncan compare.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut having the skills to get from messy to clean don&#39;t come  <br/>\nautomatically with the appreciation. When Kathryn was young -- under  <br/>\n10 -- my husband and I would fold laundry and she&#39;d come to be with  <br/>\nus. If we asked her if she&#39;d like to fold wash cloths or towels or  <br/>\nsort socks it was overwhelming to her. It seemed such a simple task!  <br/>\nIt didn&#39;t seem an unreasonable expectation. But something about the  <br/>\nway her brain was organized at the time just wouldn&#39;t allow her to  <br/>\nsee the simplicity of it. When she was 11, I could see a big change.  <br/>\nWhat was overwhelming before became simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you seen Fly Lady? Lots of people find her routines very  <br/>\nhelpful.

For example, we have water ready/easy to get for them at all times, but somehow it&#39;s just more special for them if I get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Ditto with laundry . . .for example, my DD was complaining that she did not have enough clean PJs or shirts, and I had just done a load of the kids&#39; laundry . . .but she didn&#39;t put them in the hamper like we had asked her to (this is a standing request).<br/>\n&gt; *************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When one of my kids consistently doesn&#39;t do something I&#39;ve asked, I assume there&#39;s a reason - and very often the reason is that I&#39;ve asked something my kid isn&#39;t developmentally ready to do. Putting clothes in the hamper every time is a great example. Kids are soooo busy doing the things they need to do - learning! that little things like that fall off their radar easily. They aren&#39;t ready to hold laundry and running and eating and building and cutting and finding out all in their minds at once. That comes later - teens or twenties. So all you&#39;re doing is creating frustration, in yourself because you have an expectation that won&#39;t be met (consistently without reminders) for many years, and in your kids who quickly get tired of the same information over and over (blah blah blah blah, are you listnening?).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Response:<br/>\nI am not upset that my DD does not usually put her laundry in the hamper. However, the fact remains, that someone has to find her dirty clothes and wash them. I was wondering how other people handle this, esp., like I said with several young children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I&#39;m really interested in hearing what others have to say about this because I&#39;m not sure at all how other people, esp. in slightly larger families, balance it all.<br/>\n&gt; *************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For unschooling to work, it helps to step away from the idea of balance. Life isn&#39;t balanced. Life is messy and involved. Some things balance out over the course of a life, but not always, and that&#39;s okay. Love doesn&#39;t have to be balanced, in fact, its better when its completely Unbalanced - love unconditionally! I don&#39;t balance my kindness or generosity like a checkbook, I give as much as I can, whenever I can. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Response: Oh, trust me, my life is messy and involved.  But I still like the word &quot;balance.&quot;  I don&#39;t believe it is really possible, because things are always changing, but I think it is a good goal.  You mention &quot;love unconditionally.&quot;  For many people, a hot meal, clean clothes, and a relatively organized living space IS a symbol of love.  It shouldn&#39;t come at the expense of nagging/complaining/etc., but scrounging for food, not being able to find what you want, not even being able to walk in a room because of a mess?  No, I don&#39;t think that helps anyone feel peaceful.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; As crazy as it sounds, a desire for efficiency may be part of your problem. I know, most housekeeping advice revolves around streamlining processes, but I think you&#39;ve made a wrong term in trying to get your kids on board with that. They are children! Childhood is not, by nature, efficient. Its messy and involved. Kids are messy and involved. They are busy living life to the fullest. Trying to get them to be more efficient denies their very nature. Let them be children. Invite them to help, but don&#39;t expect it. They will help when and how they can - they Want to help you! But it will be on their own terms for many years to come. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Response: I don&#39;t expect my children to help much (esp. not my 2 and 4 yo), though they sometimes do. (My 2 yo is actually an amazing organizer when she feels like it.)  I DO expect my 7 yo to: bring her plate to the sink and put her laundry in the hamper.  That&#39;s it.  I don&#39;t think those two tasks will &quot;deny her of her very nature.&quot;  I never remind her about her plate (she does it automatically, and if she forgets, I don&#39;t care.)  The clothes . . .I don&#39;t get mad, but I do remind, esp. when she complains that she has no clothes, that it would help if she put them in the hamper. It&#39;s like with her piano lessons .  . .she chose to take them.  But, her teacher expects her to practice.  I expect her to practice, too, since the money for them isn&#39;t easily found.  At ANY point she can stop taking lessons, though. Expectations are not a bad thing, I don&#39;t think, when there is a choice.  When it comes to laundry, if she doesn&#39;t put her clothes away, then she might (not because of being punished, but just because I thought she had) have to wait longer for the clothes she wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also notice that my children prefer it when things are organized.  They play far more and at a deeper level when things are organized.  They create more when they have their materials easily accessible and a place to work.  They are happier when their needs are met quickly because I am organized.  I have little routines built into the day that make things better . . .but I still have a long way to go, and as I said, it&#39;s only going to get harder, at least for a few years.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Making the transition","postDate":"1254178878","msgId":41667,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg5cmY3dSt0c3FwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg5cXNhcCtpbTRoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41666,"nextInTopic":41671,"prevInTime":41666,"nextInTime":41668,"topicId":41637,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ********************** In what way is it not working?

But most importantly, for all of that to work we had to learn to be respectful and mindful of ourselves. Once I decided to respect who I was and who I wanted to be, I was realy able to break the chains and paradigms of how I was raised.

The playroom one is a perfect example of something I struggle with.  If the kids have a messy playroom, I don&#39;t care . . .EXCEPT that then they do not want to use it or be in it.  They avoid it when it is messy.  When it&#39;s clean, they go in an enjoy it, and remark that it looks so nice because it is clean.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are my options?  So far, one thing I&#39;ve done is try to remove toys so that it is easier to clean, but DH complains that if I take out more they won&#39;t have anything left.  (My theory is, though, less is more.)  One of their favorite activities is to make their own toys out of paper.  I used to let them have unlimited access to paper, but that ended up with paper everywhere.  For two reasons, this wasn&#39;t working . . .one, I (sadly) couldn&#39;t afford this (a lot of the paper was damaged in some way by being on the floor ans such, so they would refuse to use it, meaning a lot of waste) and two, again, they would not want to be in the room when it was that messy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are very young (7, 4, and 2) so I don&#39;t know how to make this whole thing win-win.  I would love to say that I&#39;d clean the room regularly, and I try, but that isn&#39;t working either.  It&#39;s only going to get harder, since I am expecting another baby in November and have just started a new job (working from home and on my own schedule at least).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the same with the dishes . . .my oldest DD is in the habit of bringing her dish to the sink, and I admit that it helps a lot.  I certainly do not have a spotless house, but I find that when everyone contributes to the things that need to get done, everyone is happier overall.  For example, when I can keep up with the dishes, when we get home from wherever and everyone is hungry, I can get everyone fed much faster when I am not trying to get food AND manage the dishes.  Ditto with laundry . . .for example, my DD was complaining that she did not have enough clean PJs or shirts, and I had just done a load of the kids&#39; laundry . . .but she didn&#39;t put them in the hamper like we had asked her to (this is a standing request). I had not seen the dirty items on the floor to wash them, or I would have.  So, she didn&#39;t have the clothes she wanted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am always looking for ways that make everything more efficient so that, in the end, there is less work.

It helped Me to find ways to keep busy in the same space as my kids, things I could put down easily without getting frustrated. That let me be present more and observe more - start to learn what my kids really needed. I also transitioned away from &quot;discipline&quot; by means of working on improving my parenting skills: being more proactive, asking my self &quot;why not?&quot; and learning to say &quot;yes&quot; more, and in more ways, so there wasn&#39;t a &quot;need&quot; to discipline. That was kind of amazing to me, that I was really using discipline as a substitute for better skills. I&#39;ve seen that same process with my partner, too. The more his skills improved, the less he resorted to discipline. There ARE more options! It just takes time and practice to be used to seeing them consistently, and most of all proactively.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one of the reasons unschoolers sometimes struggle with questions like &quot;what do you do when xyz happens.&quot; Soooooo much of what makes unschooling different is making xyz a non-issue in the first place. There&#39;s more thinking ahead - a Lot more thinking ahead. I&#39;m seeing this a lot right now as one of the kids who plays with Mo has very &quot;conventional&quot; AP parents. Very loving and supportive, but they also parent by reacting to kids. I&#39;ve started asking for more notice when they want to come play so *I* can think ahead about what the kids need, and be ready, not stuck reacting under stress. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; One thing I wonder - when your children interact with other adults, do you place the responsibility for drawing personal boundaries on the other adult? For example, my oldest will talk the ear off a brass monkey.  Seriousely.  And when he &#39;catches&#39; an unsuspecting adult to chat with, it can go on and on and on ....<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************************<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I used to do with Ray, when he was younger, was to check in with other adults and make sure they weren&#39;t feeling overwhelmed. If they were - or seemed to be - I&#39;d do whatever I could to gently extricate Ray, either offer to play, or suggest its time to leave, or whatever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really active about making sure my kids aren&#39;t impacting the people and places around them in negative ways - I stay pretty close to Mo in any new situation until I&#39;m confident she has a good grasp of the boundaries, and with Ray I used to stick to him like glue or make sure another adult was doing so. In either case, the important thing has been that I&#39;m Not &quot;supervising&quot; I&#39;m there as a friend and helper. That&#39;s important. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;But other times I think, no, let&#39;s just let things run their natural course.  If the adult wants to get out of the converstation, the adult can say &quot;well, gotta go now!&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************************<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t assume other adults have the skills or confidence to do this. One of the things I model is knowing when to move on. I don&#39;t necessarily have to explain why - with Ray that was sometimes helpful, but not so much with Mo. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158915970,"authorName":"Alan","from":"&quot;Alan&quot; &lt;alanlmarshall@...&gt;","profile":"alanlmarshall","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Making the transition","postDate":"1254075934","msgId":41651,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg5b2FtdStuYzhkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc0MDU4LjkyNzIxLnFtQHdlYjM5ODA1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":41649,"nextInTopic":41653,"prevInTime":41650,"nextInTime":41652,"topicId":41637,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***How do you draw the line between non-controlling, non-punitive relationship and absentee parenting?*** There is no line to draw because being non-punitive","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1534350755\">***How do you draw the line between non-controlling, non-punitive relationship and absentee parenting?***<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no line to draw because being non-punitive is not in proximity to absentee parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat description seems to suggest that the less a parent controls or punishes, the less present that parent is, and so it is just a matter of reducing the punishment just enough but not too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut really, the opposite is true in practice.

One big piece is about experimenting with how little kids learn to control their own cognitive function, how they learn to learn from play basically.  There&#39;s a lot about all the failed attempts we&#39;ve made as parents and teachers to condition them like animals, training their self-control with gold stars and scolding, time-outs and praise.  The upshot is that children develop it for themselves from imaginative play, where they assume various roles and follow the &quot;rules&quot; of that role so the game can be played.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/magazine/27tools-t.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/magazine/27tools-t.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis might not appeal to most folks the same way it does to me as an academic, but any unschooler is likely to find some confidence-building and useful ideas or insights for their own situations, and maybe you have someone in your life like a schoolteacher sister or a disapproving neighbor you can give it to, too!  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurred to me that we were very big into power of story through movies, books, television, musical theatre characters and then later, videogames and other crossovers for the same characters and stories. Most of our humor and game-playing as a family was centered on following the rules of whatever roles were were playing out, from the time Dad would be Eeyore or a Wild Thing and the child would be Christopher Robin or Pooh or Max, to throwing Les Miz and Ragtime dialogue and songs back and forth as we do now, with two teens. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can remember acting out the Wizard of Oz with the neighborhood kids in Allison Hall&#39;s front yard, scene to scene.

But I was raised in a household that was both controlling and abusive and my childhood was spent with two parents who didn&#39;t like each other, so the issue of control has been a theme that I&#39;ve had the opportunity to give a lot of thought to. I thought I had it figured out (under control, if you will) until we decided to unschool, but then it popped up yet again - because unschooling for us was such a change from the way I was raised, I had to really let go. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt its essence, my general theory about control is this: we all need a certain amount of it. That amount is different for each person based on brain chemistry, genetics, upbringing, fears, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we operate under the fundamental thought that we all need a finite measure of control, then it&#39;s a quick leap to this: if I have firm control over something in my life and I lose that control for some reason, I&#39;ll need/strive to gain control over something else in my life to balance my overall Control Account. It&#39;s simple accounting, really; a debit in one place leads to a credit in another.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn real terms, it works like this, at least for me. When things are going great at work - when I am valued, when I know what I&#39;m doing, when I can measure my success, when good things are happening - then I feel in control of work, and I am able to completely let go at home. When things at work suck (as they have for the past month until a few days ago), then I feel out of control at work. My brain somehow determines that I need to control something, dammit - and so I control whatever else I can to get some sense of balance. I always try to control &quot;insignificant&quot; things first, like responding to emails, cleaning the house, doing dishes, restocking the kitchen, etc. When that doesn&#39;t work well enough or quickly enough, then I become the Sabo Family House Jackass because I attempt to control everything that happens at home. This isn&#39;t intentional; I don&#39;t want to be the Jackass. I try to control other stuff. Just doesn&#39;t always happen. <br/>\n <br/>\nBut this has become very rare since we started to unschool, and I think that the basic reason for that is because unschooling for us isn&#39;t just about education & learning, and it&#39;s not only about mindful and respectful parenting - it&#39;s about mindful and respectful living, with our kids, with each other, with friends/family/ others, with all we come in contact with. But most importantly, for all of that to work we had to learn to be respectful and mindful of ourselves. Once I decided to respect who I was and who I wanted to be, I was realy able to break the chains and paradigms of how I was raised. Let me be clear - it wasn&#39;t about simply committing that I would do better with my own kids, it was about committing to do better with myself; after that, doing better with the kids became easy because I was no longer burdened with my own baggage. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar@earthlink.net","from":"&lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Making the transition","postDate":"1254068917","msgId":41644,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE5GRURLREZBR0lPQ0RCQ01HUEhPQUVMTkNOQUEub3RoZXJzdGFyQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDc0MDU4LjkyNzIxLnFtQHdlYjM5ODA1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":41643,"nextInTopic":41645,"prevInTime":41643,"nextInTime":41645,"topicId":41637,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... unschooling, but the parenting aspect.

An absentee parent doesn&#39;t listen to what their children<br/>\nhave to say. An absentee parent is never there. To keep from being an<br/>\nabsentee parent, you build trust between you and your children. You let them<br/>\nknow that they can come to you for ANYTHING without fear. I am always in the<br/>\nbackground and my kids know that I am here if they want guidance or have a<br/>\nquestion or just need a hug. An unschooling parent makes suggestions and<br/>\nprovides opportunities for children but is okay if the child rejects those<br/>\nsuggestions and opportunities. You become very aware of your children and<br/>\nwhat they like and dislike and provide opportunities accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\nRecent Activity<br/>\n  a..  17New Members<br/>\nVisit Your Group<br/>\nSell Online<br/>\nStart selling with<br/>\n<br/>\nour award-winning<br/>\n<br/>\ne-commerce tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

An arbitrary guideline might be something like a demand for a cleaned toy room or to have dirty dishes returned to the sink immediately after use - in other words, a guideline that has to do with OUR need to have OUR KIDS conform to something WE WANT. A non-arbitrary guideline might be something like brandishing a knife in a threatening manner, or shooting golf balls at a picture window, for example. These are things that would create HARM or DANGER, for our kids or others. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept of &quot;absentee parenting&quot; or &quot;unparenting&quot; is always interesting. I think that any discussion about that requires people to have the same understanding of what parenting IS before they think about what parenting IS NOT. In our family, it&#39;s pretty simple: our role is to love, empower, explore, coach, aid, listen, learn, care about/for. Control is not part of the job description. &quot;Absentee Parenting&quot; is the opposite of those words, feelings and actions. <br/>\n<br/>\nJeff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284534827,"authorName":"Jeff Sabo","from":"Jeff Sabo &lt;freeboysdad@...&gt;","profile":"freeboysdad","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Making the transition","postDate":"1254067906","msgId":41642,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ1MDY4MS43NjQxMi5xbUB3ZWI1NTgwNC5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDc0MDU4LjkyNzIxLnFtQHdlYjM5ODA1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGg5bnVnbStxODg0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NzQwNTguOTI3MjEucW1Ad2ViMzk4MDUubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41639,"nextInTopic":41643,"prevInTime":41641,"nextInTime":41643,"topicId":41637,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Cuddlfishy wrote: ***For those of you who were raised in more controlling, punitive families (by this I mean mainstream parenting, not necessarily what most","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-718826371\">Cuddlfishy wrote: ***For those of you who were raised in more controlling, punitive families (by this I mean mainstream parenting, not necessarily what most would define as abuse), how did you make the transition?

I think it&#39;s time to remind everyone what our list guidelines are and what this list is about.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re new to a list, it&#39;s a good idea to read a while before you start giving advice. When advice is given that is so beyond the focus of the list, it&#39;s hard to handle the many responses that make you feel like everyone in the world is saying you&#39;re &quot;wrong&quot;. It&#39;s overwhelming, so please, please read for a while and get a feel for the atmosphere and<br/>\nthe general style of the list before you start posting. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur list description:<br/>\n~~~A list designed for those new to the philosophy of unschooling. Ask experienced unschoolers all those niggling questions, and find out how unschooling works in real families.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re familiar with John Holt&#39;s work, but unsure of how to begin or what an unschooling day really looks like, this is a place for you to discuss,question, ponder and become deeply familiar with natural learning and how it affects our entire lives. From parenting issues to learning from the whole wide world and beyond, come explore the issues that unschooling families have dealt with in the past and how to get beyond &quot;school-think&quot; to a joyful unschooling lifestyle!~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd our guidelines, which should be read carefully upon joining! <br/>\n<br/>\nDear new member,<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the unschoolingbasics list. We look forward to sharing information and ideas with you, but first, we ask you to look over our posting and list guidelines:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) No discussions will be allowed about posts. This is called a &quot;meta-discussion&quot; (discussing the discussion) and posts analyzing another person&#39;s post or posting style will be rejected and the member put on moderation. If there is something about a post that bothers you, stick to discussing the ideas presented, rather than the post itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Please only post issues/topics that you are open to discussing. If it&#39;s in your message, it&#39;s open to discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  Try to change the subject line if the topic changes. This will help us all access archives and utilize the discussions more effectively. Also, trim your posts to avoid a message that takes up too much room. It&#39;s difficult to read through them.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) All new members will be moderated in order to prevent spam from reaching the list. We try to remove members quickly, but please be patient. It&#39;s also a chance for you to get a feel for the &quot;culture&quot; of the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) This list supports AP styles of parenting, which include no spanking or punitive methods.  If you are interested in learning methods of parenting that do not involve punishment and hitting, this is a wonderful resource. We love helping families find more positive ways of relating.  If you are interested in defending punitive styles, this might not be the best list for you.  Many of us have used these methods in the past and found new and better ways of relating to our children. While you will find support if you&#39;re interested in learning new methods, you will also find some pretty strong opinions if you believe punitive/controlling parenting is best.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) If you post something that the owners or moderators know will be inflammatory, we will offer to post it for you, without your name attached. That way, newer members can read the responses and decide if they want to participate in the discussion without feeling that they&#39;re being personally attacked. Remember, this IS a discussion list and we love to question and discuss!:)<br/>\n<br/>\n7)This is a secular list, meaning that anyone of any religous persuasion (or none at all) is welcome here. We understand that the topic of religion may surface and that is acceptable, but we do not allow preaching or religous debates of any kind. We are a diverse list and we ask all members to simply respect the fact that our list represents many different belief systems. We are all here to discuss unschooling and how it applies in all of our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you visit the actual site, we are adding information and resources under the &quot;links&quot; section. Book recommendations, blogs and websites will be linked for you to access.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to upload pictures of yourself and family at the &quot;photos&quot; section if you wish. Sometimes it&#39;s nice to have a visual of the folks we talk with daily.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing:<br/>\nIf you have questions, problems, comments or compliments (yeah, we love those:), please feel free to write the list owners~ Kelly Lovejoy or Ren Allen, or the moderators~ Rue Kream or Deb Lewis. If you send an email to &quot;list owners&quot; we will all receive it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo welcome! Let&#39;s get talking....<br/>\n<br/>\nRen and Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anything unclear in the guidelines? Have I failed to make it obvious that we are NOT in support of punishment/reward styles of parenting? Please let me know if I need to add anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if people are even reading the guidelines when they join....it&#39;s been frustrating lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nradicalunschooling.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41672,"nextTopicId":41704}}
