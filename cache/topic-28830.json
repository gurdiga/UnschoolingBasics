It IS recognized as education. My guess is that she could <br/>\nstudy a tiny bit and get her certification as a Master Groomer.

Well, and the <br/>\npractical side of grooming four dogs for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even so, you don&#39;t need that MG certificate.

Form follows function: why were they <br/>\ndeveloped, so why they look as they do. (I know a lot about different <br/>\ncountries because of what breeds they developed where, when, and why. I <br/>\neven knew where Afghanistan was when I was in fifth grade because I <br/>\nadored the Afghan hound! &lt;G&gt; I also won a trivia question recently <br/>\nbecause I knew where Ibiza was---and how to pronounce it---because of <br/>\nthe Ibizan hound.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMath:<br/>\n<br/>\nProportion, Balance, Geometry<br/>\nAccounting and keeping books<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has studied extensively in the areas of holistic pet<br/>\ncare and holistic health (for people), aromatherapy, nutrition, <br/>\nvegetarian &<br/>\nvegan lifestyles, organic food and industry (clothing, etc)?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAll Health/Life Sciences/Biology related<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nShe does creative<br/>\nwriting and poetry-but none of it has been &quot;graded&quot; and in fact rarely <br/>\nshared<br/>\nwith anyone-but does that decrease the value of the hours she has put <br/>\ninto it<br/>\n(hundreds!)?

What they have is life  <br/>\nexperience which is even better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is a way of artificially dividing up the world into pieces so  <br/>\nit can be fed efficiently to a room full of kids by one person in a  <br/>\nway it can be tested. School was designed as a way to raise the  <br/>\neducation level of the masses when the US had a huge influx of  <br/>\nuntrained immigrants who didn&#39;t speak English. It was never designed  <br/>\nto raise every person up to college material. But schools have been  <br/>\ntrying to use a system that wasn&#39;t designed for that task to do that  <br/>\nfor decades.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is learning naturally, organically, what you need to do  <br/>\nwhat interests you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is a long way of saying that a unschooled person, like a  <br/>\nhomeschooled person, fills in the &quot;Level of Education&quot; with  <br/>\nhomeschool graduate and then &quot;Experience&quot; with volunteer and paying  <br/>\njobs and projects related to the job that they&#39;ve had.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What about college?  There certain skills and knowledge expectations<br/>\n&gt; that colleges expect.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Colleges work with what they&#39;re given. They sort high school students  <br/>\nby grades because that&#39;s what they have to work with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s what they want. They really don&#39;t want a  <br/>\nherd of applicants who have sat in chairs doing what they&#39;re told for  <br/>\n12 years who will expect to continue the same for the next 4 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nColleges really like older students who have been out in the work  <br/>\nforce and are in college not because it&#39;s what you do after high  <br/>\nschool but because they want to be there to further their knowledge  <br/>\nin a particular field that they already know they like.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids can also take community college courses in subjects  <br/>\nthat interest them. That&#39;s a good way of showing someone is capable  <br/>\nof college level work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s ironic but the Ivy League and top tier colleges are more likely  <br/>\nknow what to do with a homeschooled application than the lower tier  <br/>\ncolleges just because they&#39;re more likely to see them. Ivy Leagues  <br/>\nlike unschoolers because they&#39;re hungry for knowledge and haven&#39;t  <br/>\nbeen burdened down by classes for the past 12 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a booklet you might want to look into:<br/>\n<br/>\nOpportunities After &quot;High School&quot;: Thoughts, Documents, Resources, by<br/>\nWes Beach.
