Thats the real question from an unschooling perspective. If plastic is Bad, but my charming little girl can see beauty in a My Little Pony, is she Wrong?

If you want to help &quot;someone else&quot; you can find other ways, arguably more effective than denying your child a purple pony with a star on its hip.

There&#39;s no guarantee of that no matter what you do! But arguing with a child doesn&#39;t make for more peace in the world.
