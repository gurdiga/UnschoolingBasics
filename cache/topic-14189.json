There&#39;s a whole drawer full of them<br/>\nand the kids can get them before or after their haircut or if they are<br/>\njust coming in with mom or dad to pick up a bottle of shampoo.  I was<br/>\na little hesitant to associate lollies with a reward for getting hair<br/>\ncut since when my kids get their hair cut the *want* to get their hair<br/>\ncut.  It&#39;s not a case of &quot;and if you will go get that hair cut out of<br/>\nyour eyes you can get a lolly afterwards.&quot;  They see it as &quot;Cool, I<br/>\nget my hair cut *and* get a lolly.  Can this day get any better?&quot;<br/>\nAlthough it never surprises me when they choose not to get a lolly<br/>\nbecause they want something salty rather than sweet or just don&#39;t want<br/>\nanything at the moment.  They&#39;ve even taken them and put them in their<br/>\npockets for later (which I generaly end up retrieving before they get<br/>\nwashed.)  Always surprises the heck of them when that happens!  I<br/>\nthink that we have the ability to be able to use what someone else<br/>\ndeems as a &quot;reward&quot; by not making it so.  And sorry all I can think<br/>\nabout is Ewww, sugar free lollies?  That wouldn&#39;t be a reward to begin<br/>\nwith - that would be a punishment.  &quot;Here ya go kid.
