One of the few things my mom did &quot;right&quot; was to notice that this <br/>\nfeeling that I needed to parent my brothers was kind of stressing me out and <br/>\nmaking me resentful toward them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day she &quot;released&quot; me from this duty - even though it was self-imposed. <br/>\nShe just pulled me aside and said something like, &quot;I know how tough it is to <br/>\ntake care of 2 young boys - I want you to have fun during your childhood and <br/>\nleave the boys to me to worry about. This is such a big responsibility for <br/>\nanother little person to have to take on and I want you to know I don&#39;t <br/>\nexpect you to take care of them.&quot; That&#39;s not word for word, but you get the <br/>\npicture...<br/>\n<br/>\nShe never expected me to take care of them but I think through her requests <br/>\nfor help when the boys were younger I just assumed the role of secondary <br/>\ncaregiver and never realized that it was always a choice to help out or not. <br/>\nJust having my mom say that to me (even though it wasn&#39;t her imposing the <br/>\n&quot;chore&quot; on me in the first place) made me feel free to let go of the need to <br/>\nparent my brothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m interested in other RU parents&#39; response to this because my son is going <br/>\nto be the oldest and I don&#39;t want to fall into this pattern either...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLesa O&#39;Daniel, AAHCC<br/>\nInstructor, Bradley Method� of Natural Childbirth<br/>\n323-541-5515<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bradleybirth.com/ndweb.asp?ID=O123&Count=N\">http://www.bradleybirth.com/ndweb.asp?ID=O123&Count=N</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;jehmen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jehmen@...\">jehmen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [unschoolingbasics] siblings<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 31 Jul 2006 08:35:21 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have a 10yog, 5yog and a 4 yob.<br/>\n&gt;The dynamics are always interesting.
