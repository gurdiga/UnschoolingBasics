BUT that aside, I also once<br/>\nthought Barbies were insulting anti feminist tools and hoped to keep them<br/>\nout of my home &lt;lol&gt; The truth is right now we have the Barbie collection I<br/>\nonly dreamed of as a kid.  It was when I attempted to espouse my pov to my<br/>\nthen 4yo dd about Barbies that I heard the rediculousness of my argument.<br/>\nAnd as Su has so wisely pointed out about imaginative play (even of the<br/>\nviolent kind) has my dds learning all sorts of cooperative behavior and<br/>\ncreating all sorts of very &#39;powerful&#39; women roles.

People on this list don&#39;t know the extent of your<br/>\nrelationship with your son and can only respond to the words in your<br/>\noriginal post. That&#39;s where additional information is useful and perhaps may<br/>\nhelp you to discover the faulty thinking in what appears to be (sounds like)<br/>\nfear from your own words about the brain synapses.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for setting limits.the question I have is one only you can answer - is<br/>\nyour son really asking you to set limits for him or challenging you to act<br/>\non your fears?  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my dd&#39;s at the age of 12 said to me (once) - oh mom - will you be a<br/>\nmom and tell me what to do.  I was so shocked that she used this wording.<br/>\nThis was in response to her having to choose between two things she really<br/>\nwanted and because they were happening at the same time there was not a way<br/>\nto do both (Ski race in CT and cheer competition in NY).  It initially<br/>\nshocked me but then recognized what she was saying was make a choice for me.<br/>\nWe since discussed her expression &#39;be a real mom&#39; and she laughed saying it<br/>\ncame out of her frustration but that I in no way should be making decisions<br/>\nfor her like conventional moms do to their kids.  My younger dd will<br/>\noccasionally ask me to decide something for her.but its not about my<br/>\nlimiting her, its when faced with the reality of life&#39;s limits (ie money,<br/>\ntime, other people).  What I learned from my dh is that what helps her in<br/>\nthose situations is when I not simply acknowledge how difficult it is to<br/>\nchoice between things but rather how exciting it is that she is passionate<br/>\nabout so much that she wants to do it all!

Really, no one is going to come to your <br/>\nhouse and beat you up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can make whatever choices you want to make in your parenting.  If you <br/>\nwant to believe that your son wants you to limit him to only those things <br/>\nyou can appreciate, you can do that.   If you want to discuss it on this <br/>\nlist then it will be pointed out to you how that kind of parenting choice is <br/>\nincompatible with unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said the shows filled you with sorrow, you&#39;re worried that you&#39;re not <br/>\nsafe on an unschooling list, you think the discussion has escalated.   Your <br/>\nword choices seem exaggerated and I wonder if you really are thinking so <br/>\ndifferently from the folks who are in this discussion with you that none of <br/>\nthis will make sense to you.   I get the feeling that you really just want <br/>\nto be agreed with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think healthy people want others to limit their choices.   I think <br/>\nif a person is asking for limits it&#39;s because they don&#39;t trust their own <br/>\njudgment and placing limits on them will only exacerbate the problem.  Does <br/>\nthat answer your question?   I don&#39;t think your  son wants limits.  I think <br/>\nthe reason he wants to watch those shows by himself is because he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to hear about your &quot;fears&quot; and &quot;sorrows&quot;.  He just wants to enjoy his <br/>\nshows.   It would be really great for him if he could enjoy them with you <br/>\ninstead of feeling like he has to watch them alone to avoid your disapproval <br/>\nand disappointment.<br/>\n<br/>\n***If you would enjoy Superjail, that&#39;s fine with me.

You really have no idea how much autonomy my son has, or how our home works. I think that you made too fast a judgement of me. The reason I didn&#39;t include the name of the most disturbing show was that the particular name of the show, and whether you or someone else could tell me they like it, was not the central question. The central question is: could a child ever wish for us to set limits, and how should we respond? (I told him it felt that was happening.) The whole story about the TV show was only for illustration. That is hardly a hysterical situation or a need to &#39;calm down.&#39; I feel like this is a forum where I can express my sadness about things and I certainly never devalued the people who make or watch the shows. I do hope to raise kids who are able to understand their own feeling and determine how they feel about things, and I actually believe that can be modeled without giving the impression that people<br/>\n who think or feel differently are bad.<br/>\n  However, since you asked, the show was a pilot on Adult Swim called Superjail. Please see my description of penis eating in the other email I sent just before this. Thanks nonetheless for your energetic answer and the time that you put into it. I just hope that this makes my question more clear. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Deb Lewis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:d.lewis@...\">d.lewis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 15, 2007 10:13:46 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Are limits ever good or needed<br/>\n<br/>\n***But last night there was a reason he watched several hours<br/>\nwith me nearby.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was the reason?<br/>\n<br/>\nI watch movies with Dylan but I watch because we enjoy the same kinds of <br/>\nmovies and because I enjoy being with him and hearing his opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\n***The shows seemed to me...hideous. I choose that word very<br/>\ncarefully. They were to me violent, bleak, hopeless and soul-numbing. They<br/>\nfilled me with sorrow for their makers and for their audience, which I was <br/>\nso<br/>\nsorry to find included my son. I am not naive; I am 46, have been through <br/>\nmuch<br/>\nin life and I work in an ER. I am not that easily shocked. I doubt that my<br/>\nfeelings were unreasonable. I shared my sorrow with him. Our discussion went <br/>\non<br/>\nfor a while, but no agreement could be reached.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if you&#39;d be willing to tell us what the shows were, or why you <br/>\ndidn&#39;t tell us what they were?<br/>\nYou chose your words carefully but could part of the reason you didn&#39;t tell <br/>\nus what the shows were be that you didn&#39;t want to have to defend your <br/>\ncarefully chosen words if someone here said, &quot;I watch that!&quot; or, &quot;my kids <br/>\nwatch that!&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing &quot;filled with sorrow&quot; for people who made a movie you found hideous <br/>\nseems extreme. That&#39;s a really big judgment about a couple hundred people <br/>\n(or however many worked on that film) you don&#39;t know anything about. And <br/>\nthe audience? That may be thousands of people you&#39;re assuming have such <br/>\npoor judgment and character they need you to feel sorry for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou wrote, &quot;The shows seemed to me... hideous&quot;... &quot;They were to me <br/>\nviolent...They filled me with sorrow...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThose movies weren&#39;t about you or your experiences. You&#39;re reacting to <br/>\nwhat you suppose is a kind of warped psychology behind the production of the <br/>\nmovies. You&#39;re the one with the problem, not your son, and you&#39;re working <br/>\nreally hard at trying to make him share your problem. Your feelings while <br/>\nwatching the movies are not universal. What you&#39;re doing is like a school <br/>\nkid trying to make her friends hate a person she hates. You&#39;ll feel better <br/>\nabout yourself if you can get someone else to agree with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son does not have to share your feelings or opinions to be a good <br/>\nperson. He can make different choices and enjoy different things and still <br/>\nbe a smart and thoughtful person.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is something I think it&#39;s hard for us to wrap our mind around. Our <br/>\nrelationship with our kids is like no other relationship. We know them from <br/>\nthe moment they&#39;re born. We come to know what every cry means, what every <br/>\nlook means and we think we know everything about them. But that changes, <br/>\nand NEEDS to change. Our kids are entitled to their own thoughts and ideas, <br/>\ntheir own preferences. They have a right to be themselves. We do not have <br/>\na right to be inside their heads deciding what they like and what they <br/>\nvalue.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou wrote, ...&quot;They were to me violent...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kid gets cranky when people say a movie is violent. The movie doesn&#39;t go <br/>\nafter anyone and bludgeon them. The movie doesn&#39;t shoot at people. The <br/>\nmovie doesn&#39;t slap anyone around or spank babies. Movies aren&#39;t violent. <br/>\nThere might be depictions of violence in a movie but a movie is not <br/>\ncommitting violence against anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n***He at first thought that because I feared that these shows, seen so <br/>\nfrequently, could<br/>\nharm him, that I lacked trust in him. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think he&#39;s absolutely right.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I went over again my belief that frequent exposure to anything will begin <br/>\nto influence almost anybody. He began to<br/>\nsay..&quot;Maybe you shouldn&#39;t allow this.&quot;***<br/>\n<br/>\nLot&#39;s of parents convince their kids that they can&#39;t trust their own <br/>\njudgment.

It seems so loaded. If you call that kind of play  <br/>\n&quot;violent&quot; instead of &quot;imaginative play,&quot; for instance, it&#39;s really  <br/>\neasy to move to thinking it&#39;s bad, or less-preferred than other kinds  <br/>\nof imaginative play. It&#39;s easy to say you don&#39;t want--or allow--your  <br/>\nkids to do it. But there&#39;s no violence happening! Nobody&#39;s getting hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I have a little essay brewing about how cooperative so- <br/>\ncalled &quot;violent play&quot; is. The kids have to agree on what universe to  <br/>\nbe in (knights or star wars or something else), what kinds of weapons  <br/>\nare OK, who is on what side, what the parameters of play are. Play is  <br/>\nregularly interrupted while the kids sort out issues like whether  <br/>\nLuke can suddenly decide to be a bad guy, or what happens when  <br/>\nsomeone gets &quot;killed.&quot; An enormous amount of cooperation goes on in  <br/>\nsupposedly &quot;violent&quot; play.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like those studies, too, that find that kids engage in more  <br/>\n&quot;aggressive&quot; play after they watch certain movies. That doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>\nthat kids are being aggressive toward each other; it means that they  <br/>\nare engaging in imaginative play with aggression, fighting, or  <br/>\nviolence as elements of _pretend_.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Are limits ever good or needed","postDate":"1179247119","msgId":23627,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVCRDQwMzhFLUREMUQtNDREOC04N0E2LTU1MTlDRTk0NUVERkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNzgwMWM3OTcwYyQwNDZhMTAxMCQwMjAxYThjMEBkZWJvcmFoNzZhNzlodj4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwNzgwMWM3OTcwYyQwNDZhMTAxMCQwMjAxYThjMEBkZWJvcmFoNzZhNzlodj4="},"prevInTopic":23624,"nextInTopic":23628,"prevInTime":23626,"nextInTime":23628,"topicId":23624,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
