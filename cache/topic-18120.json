School<br/>\ndidn&#39;t become mandatory until recent history.  Prior to that school<br/>\nwas optional, expensive, private, and mostly run by the churches (at<br/>\nleast mass schools).  Medieval schools were mostly following the<br/>\ntrivium or quadrium thought of education (memorization, rhetoric and<br/>\ncomposition).  But these schools were really for the elite. They were<br/>\nvery costly to attend.  children were children until they were old<br/>\nenough to become apprenticed.  They would play and follow their<br/>\n(mostly) mothers around mimicking or helping her work.  Children<br/>\n&quot;worked&quot; not because they were expected to but because it was a good<br/>\nway for mothers to keep little hands busy while she tended to the<br/>\nthings she needed to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce apprenticed (sometimes in their father&#39;s profession and sometimes<br/>\nin someone else&#39;s) they learned those things they needed for their<br/>\nprofession.  Sometimes it was something that the child was interested<br/>\nin and sometimes it wasn&#39;t.  Those that liked their profession did<br/>\nwell in business.  Those that didn&#39;t, well, didn&#39;t.  We have to<br/>\nremember that their worlds were much smaller than our worlds.  they<br/>\nonly knew what went on around them, usually within a one mile<br/>\ncircumference of their homes.  They had heard of other cities and<br/>\ntowns and professions, but they were about as mythical as our thinking<br/>\nof astronauts working on the space station.  We&#39;ve heard about it,<br/>\nread about and seen pictures, but for the most part it is truly<br/>\nmysterious to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way we are regressing :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":285278359,"authorName":"wuweimama","from":"&quot;wuweimama&quot; &lt;wuweimama@...&gt;","profile":"wuweimama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Still learning...","postDate":"1160660659","msgId":18121,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVnbGdyaitvZ2F1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVna2VpZitzOWZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18120,"nextInTopic":18138,"prevInTime":18120,"nextInTime":18122,"topicId":18120,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
