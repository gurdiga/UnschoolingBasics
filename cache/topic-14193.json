Keep records, photos, notebooks.<br/>\n<br/>\n Spend some time volunteering at a vet&#39;s or---better! at a vet school.<br/>\n<br/>\n Get her a really good microscope---the best you can afford.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Get to know your local coroner---maybe interview him for a <br/>\nnewspaper/magazine article. Then invite him for supper! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n Visit websites.<br/>\n<br/>\n  THEN: put together an *awesome* portfolio on the subject to submit as <br/>\nher &quot;transcript&quot; to a good forensic college. And don&#39;t go to the <br/>\nadmissions office: go to the head of the forensic department.

She is really too young to be worrying about college <br/>\n- it&#39;s probably coming from her best friend who is homeschooled with a strict <br/>\ncurriculum.

An unschooling family friend of ours has a son who is 16 and <br/>\nwas taking some classes at a community college recently so that&#39;s got her all <br/>\nfired up about it also.

Had really interesting and relevant life experiences that  <br/>\nimpressed admissions officers enough to let him/her in without the  <br/>\nacademic background usually expected<br/>\n2. Written a fantastic essay that caught the admission officer&#39;s  <br/>\nattention, got the applicant an interview in which he wowed the  <br/>\nadmissions people enough to let him in, again without any real  <br/>\nacademic background.<br/>\n3. Scored super high on the SAT and SAT2 exams - high enough to get  <br/>\nin without having to meet any course/grade requirements.<br/>\n4. Took a smattering of community college or university extension  <br/>\ncourses - enough to convince the admissions people that the applicant  <br/>\nwas capable of doing really well in college work.<br/>\n5. Took (usually over a period of more than 2 years) community  <br/>\ncollege work that qualified the applicant to transfer to a university  <br/>\nas a junior, with all his/her general education requirements already  <br/>\ncompleted. When they do this, nobody cares about high school anymore  <br/>\n- since they&#39;ve got a couple of years of college, that&#39;s what the  <br/>\ncollege looks at.<br/>\n<br/>\nTranscripts can be very different from what people usually think -   <br/>\nthey can include anything you think might be relevant and are not  <br/>\njust a list of courses and grades (although for a college application  <br/>\nit is useful to have some courses with a non-parent giving grades -  <br/>\nbut you don&#39;t have to WORRY about that until the child IS very close  <br/>\nto college age).<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 8, 2006, at 7:20 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:barndogzzz@...\">barndogzzz@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Oh, I didn&#39;t think there were *provisions* for *unschooled kids!*  <br/>\n&gt; Our 12 yo<br/>\n&gt; was questioning me recently about her fears that she &quot;Might not be  <br/>\n&gt; able to get<br/>\n&gt; into colleges without a diploma or equivalent.&quot; She is very much  <br/>\n&gt; wanting to<br/>\n&gt; get into something within the field of forensics and she&#39;s got  <br/>\n&gt; college on her<br/>\n&gt; brain.
