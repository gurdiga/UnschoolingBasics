Temps have been heating up and cooling off as long as the earth is old. As far back the 1500s man has documented periods of increased heat and increased cooling. Back in the 1970&#39;s when we began being able to monitor the earth by satellite, they called for another ice age. It wasn&#39;t the first 20th century predicted ice age either. The vast majority of CO2 that&#39;s in the atmosphere comes from water vapor. Some of it comes from our exhaling. Manmade CO2 - even with all the SUVs, even with all the smoke stacks -- accounts for 4% of the CO2 in the atmosphere. Food for thought at the very least.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe your sons could study the climate patterns. They could go back as far as the 1500s and watch the patterns / cycles of temperatures. They could also study the cycles of the sun, which plays a part in how hot a summer can be. Sunspots are very interesting. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is so much information available to us regarding our climate, the earths cycles, solar cycles, (surprisingly) what goes in the atmosphere and much much more. To take a global warming warning without truely taking advantage of the information out there, would be cheating yourself of wonderful knowledge. Your sons would feel better knowing just how the climate works, history&#39;s recorded data and that there is so much more invovled with the climate than a movie tells you. Of course being green is a wonderful way to be. Sadly so many people don&#39;t put forth the effort. What is even more sad is too many of those that preach do not live the green way. There are so many things that your kids could learn about and do to set an example for others. As an astrophysics major I can tell you the information out there is beyond the quantity that you&#39;d need to put together a great lesson plan for discovery.  I wish them luck on their path. <br/>\nAn interesting read <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast20oct_1.htm\">http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast20oct_1.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nK.
