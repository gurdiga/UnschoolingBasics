And there is a collection of articles here (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/index.html)\">http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/index.html)</a> that may have something of interest for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvolution is everywhere. Having a background in evolutionary science it is hard to know where to suggest you could go to examine the precepts. The Beak of the Finch is good as it underscores the ideas of island biogeography and speciation and shows where Darwin had his &quot;AHA&quot; moment. Actually, I just read Skellig by David Almond which is a weird mix of science with an angel in this boy&#39;s garage. Evolution is very present in the book with talk about pneumatic bones in birds and humans evolving from/with apes. But it probably isn&#39;t a book that will explain evolution. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvolution does and should have holes. It isn&#39;t faith. It&#39;s science. But the basis, the theory, is sound. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a sort of an arms race theory of evolution (actually Matt Ridley has some great books on evolution, my favorite is the Red Queen (which I am sure is out of date now), the Red Queen is the classic literary image for the arms race between predator and prey as she runs and runs as fast as she can and never gets anywhere), where those subtle mutations that give an individual a survival advantage over its peers are selected for. Apparently in Europe there is a 10% resistance to HIV that is not known to exist in other populations. Some folks from Liverpool University have linked it to the Black Death, which may have been an ebola-type disease instead of bubonic plague. If you didn&#39;t get killed during the plague your descendents should inherit whatever kept you from being killed. And with a disease that wiped out so many people, your genes will play a bigger role in the genetic future. That is because there are fewer people your children will be more of the population than they would have been without the plague clearing the playing field. <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of traits are simply markers of genetic health. Things like a peacock&#39;s tail. There is no individual gain to having a tail like that. It makes you more likely to be eaten and it makes it harder to fly. But, for peahens it is a shortcut to seeing how healthy a male is. And in a reproductive system where males do no parental care, it is good to be able to see how genetically healthy the male is before committing to having his kids. And in reproductive systems where males do a lot of parental care, like weaver birds, it is nice to see their nest before you commit to laying your eggs in it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I can probably answer more specific questions if you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sandy <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, November 07, 2006 12:27 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Good Sources for Evolution...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  DS and I were discussing the whole &quot;dolphins MAY have had legs&quot; issue<br/>\n  and we&#39;re both interested in finding out more information about<br/>\n  evolution.
