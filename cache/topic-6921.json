I have <br/>\nforgotten most of my Public School carreer and I am just past 30 <br/>\nyears old. Thank God I dove into life and slept,ate and drank what <br/>\never knowledge I found after leaving THAT place.  I found college <br/>\nmuch more rewarding but way toooooo time consuming.  I could learn <br/>\nall that stuff in an eigth of the time, with hardly any of the <br/>\nstress, expense or travel. Sorry, back to the point...<br/>\n  <br/>\nI was recently using some rote worksheets to teach my daughter math <br/>\nbut then I realized that she had no concept of how to figure out <br/>\nlife problems with what she had learned.  I chucked the worksheets <br/>\nand we now make up our own math thought experiments.  In a few weeks <br/>\nwe have gone from doing sheets of addition and subtraction to <br/>\nexploring concepts of multiplication, division, fractions, money <br/>\nproblems and she even tried to drag me into a percentage problem.  I <br/>\ntold her I would look it up and study it myself so I didn&#39;t screw it <br/>\nup and teach her wrong {I DISPIZE percentages%%%} Math is becoming <br/>\nfun for both of us, she is learning it faster and she now <br/>\n****WANTS**** to memorize the multiplication tables so she can <br/>\nfigure out problems faster.  What a difference, no more long <br/>\nsighs... ohhhhhmoooommmmm&#39;s... or but&#39;s... She is making everything <br/>\ninto a math problem... now how do I get her to stop, so I can think <br/>\nin english instead of math.  <br/>\n<br/>\nZoey Lee<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ren Allen&quot; <br/>\n&lt;starsuncloud@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;I am not trying to be argumentative.
