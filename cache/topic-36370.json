Please keep in mind the <br/>\nthe chemicals used in soapcrafting can be very dangerous and the <br/>\nmeasurments are precise to insure a safe end product. I have been <br/>\ncrafting soap for a very long time including as a buisness. I have <br/>\nalso seen what can happen when in a moment of distraction a fellow <br/>\nsoaper&#39;s young child was doused over the head with a full pitcher of <br/>\nlye water when little hands got too close.

I have just seen too many people attempt it without <br/>\nenough information and taking dangerous risks by not having the <br/>\nproper informtion and skipping necessary safety precautions when <br/>\nworking with lye.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Faith Void&quot; <br/>\n&lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if someone could recommend a good book or website? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; been looking but there is so much out there I feel lost.<br/>\n&gt; Me and the kidlets want to try it out.<br/>\n&gt; thanks<br/>\n&gt; Faith<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; www.bearthmama.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":248064506,"authorName":"Stacey Grimm","from":"&quot;Stacey Grimm&quot; &lt;taboulichic@...&gt;","profile":"taboulichic","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: ot-making soap","postDate":"1223483143","msgId":36429,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVjYWQ0NjgwODEwMDgwOTI1eDI2MzcxMGEzZzc5ZDZjYThjOWYzODdlZGNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NEFFMUE3QEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+","referencesHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NEFFMUE3QEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":36424,"nextInTopic":36444,"prevInTime":36428,"nextInTime":36430,"topicId":36370,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That s true.
