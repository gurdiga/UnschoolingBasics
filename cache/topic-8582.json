It has worked very well for us and we&#39;ve got<br/>\nto know many people that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nManisha<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Mother Earth (Tyra)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:motherspirit@...\">motherspirit@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Greetings to all!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am wondering if you can give me tips and pointers<br/>\n&gt; for unschoolers who are looking to get together on a<br/>\n&gt; regular basis.  I met with two women today and we<br/>\n&gt; decided that we are in need of a group that is more<br/>\n&gt; reflective of us.  I live in the Bible Belt state of<br/>\n&gt; TN which is full of Christian hsing groups in which<br/>\n&gt; me and my associates fear being witch hunted some<br/>\n&gt; days!  LOL!  We decided that we will start a group<br/>\n&gt; that is less focused on Christianity and more<br/>\n&gt; focused on the Earth and other areas of interests<br/>\n&gt; outside of religion.  It turns out that all three of<br/>\n&gt; us are unschoolers.  We decided that we want to meet<br/>\n&gt; once a week, kind of like a co-op type of situation.<br/>\n&gt;  We will talk more indepthly at our first meeting<br/>\n&gt; but my main goal is to make sure that this group is<br/>\n&gt; unschooling at its finest.  I do not want a<br/>\n&gt; classroom or teaching setting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I told them that I think that we can bring<br/>\n&gt; activities for the children to participate in if<br/>\n&gt; they want to and that they should be able to<br/>\n&gt; participate however they want.  The oldest child in<br/>\n&gt; each family is in K so I am sure the main activity<br/>\n&gt; will be playing.  My feeling is that if we want to<br/>\n&gt; promote recycling then we need to do the recycling<br/>\n&gt; and if the children want to participate then that is<br/>\n&gt; fine.  If we want to garden, then we should do the<br/>\n&gt; gardening and the children can participate if they<br/>\n&gt; want to.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We are all in agreement that we will rotate from<br/>\n&gt; house to house each week.  I would like your input<br/>\n&gt; before we meet this Friday so that I can make sure<br/>\n&gt; that we have some things to think about to make this<br/>\n&gt; a success on the front end.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I appreciate you all in advance!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Much Love<br/>\n&gt; Tyra Olufemi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
