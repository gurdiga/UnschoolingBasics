They have two kids, one more on the way and their parents father esp is very authoritarian.<br/>\n  Their mom thinks that I should just make the decision for Courtney and put her in school. Since Court has shown intrest Ive had Robyn tell Court things about the school good and bad. Next week we are going to go look around the school and see what she thinks . Anyhow for a &quot;first grader &quot; I feel that she is intelligent and very capable of making a decision.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Ive tried to explain to their mom that Courtney is having a hard time adjusting to how they do things. She said she didnt understand and could I explain. I told her for example you have been telling the girls to do their chores which basicly means clean up the kids room. <br/>\n  I told her well I dont tell my kids to do anything around the house ( with the exception of go take that away from your brother ! as he runs down the hall shaking an open bottle of ketchup :) ) That I ask them and allow them to say no. <br/>\n  So I tried to explain it by saying well you said you needed to clean yall&#39;s room ( as in her and husband). Someone could come tell you you had to do it and you&#39;d probably realize it needed to be done but you would really resent being told you had to stop what you were doing and clean it right now! Or you can continue on the computer with the bunny on your lap and then when you are done and ready you&#39;ll clean the room. <br/>\n  Youll be much happier about it and therefore will probably get it done quicker and it will probably make you happy that your room is nice and clean. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  She sorta got it but is still so stuck in the world of well kids are just not allowed to have that freedom! We are the parents we run their lives.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Anyhow sorry about the book but I typed it all to basicly say I can sympathize. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole  <br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nHow low will we go?

I now know two hsers in the area, and it took a while to <br/>\nfind each other!
