As some of you know we have three unschoolers at home...one <br/>\nveteran and two newbies.  My particular tough spot is with my newest <br/>\nnewbie, Andrew-14.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew came home from public school at Easter Break.  Honestly, I <br/>\nknew ahead of time that it would be challenging for us to adjust to <br/>\nhaving him home 24/7.  Andrew really enjoyed the social aspect of <br/>\nschool.  He has concerns about still being able to go into the <br/>\nmilitary being homeschooled.  (We&#39;ve discussed that here <br/>\npreviously...his fears are still prevelent)  He was getting in <br/>\ntrouble on a regular basis for &quot;insubordination&quot; at school.  For <br/>\nlack of better way to put it he really had/has an attitude.  What <br/>\nsome traditional parents would maybe call a &quot;chip on his shoulder&quot;.  <br/>\nHe can come of real cocky.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I have learned so far I am trying to view this <br/>\ndifferently.  I went through things like this with the four older <br/>\ngirls and hadled it poorly.  I knew nothing of what I know now, <br/>\nthen.  Now I know, and I LONG to do better by us all.  Deep down <br/>\nI&#39;ve always known there just HAD to be a better way, but old <br/>\nreflexes jump right in when no new ones are learned.  :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I am SO struggling with relating to him.  In the negative <br/>\nsense he is disrespectful and rude.  It&#39;s not just with me, although <br/>\nmostly it is, it&#39;s with the whole family.  It&#39;s SO hard to take, and <br/>\nI really, really don&#39;t have the &quot;tools&quot; to grab onto to handle the <br/>\nsituations as they arise in a more positive manner.  It&#39;s SO hard to <br/>\nstomach.  Can anyone shed a light on the positive parenting <br/>\nnecessary to help a child through a tough spot?<br/>\n<br/>\nI can try to give an example if necessary, but right now I am having <br/>\ndifficulty putting it into words.  I just want to be able to handle <br/>\na situation that would stereotypically be labled rude or <br/>\ndisrespectful.  Let me know if you need more info...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks - Tina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15251,"nextTopicId":15260}}
