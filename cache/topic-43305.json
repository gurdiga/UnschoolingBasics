When Dylan was younger, and especially in the morning when he was more likely to be in need of quick protien,  he did not have the patience to think about what he wanted to eat.   He was happier if I had food ready so he could eat right away.     I made sure to make things I knew he really liked.  I&#39;d make a couple different things so he could have variety and I planned it so that if something was left over I could use it at lunch or dinner.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSince you know what they like, maybe having food ready when they wake up would be easier on them. (and you)  You don&#39;t have to make everything in the house available to them.  Make a variety of what people are most likely to eat and put it on the table so they can see and smell it.

You can make silver dollar pancakes and small burritoes.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can find a way to plan food use better - and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not easy when you&#39;re feeding four kids!  - that might help some.

Also, I find that it helps to have foods sitting out on the counter so that my little ones can grab and go.

I will ask my children what they want to eat and then provide it for them or make it for them and I do not mind being a short-order cook.  Preparing 4 different breakfasts is really no big deal for me...what really bugs me (and I need some experienced perspective) is the waste of food.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI will cook up the requested bean burrito, poached eggs and pancakes easily...but then my 4 year old looks at her pancakes that she wanted three minutes ago and changes her mind and and wants her brother&#39;s bean burrito...no problem really...here ya go 1 bean burrito...no, now she wants a poached egg...and so it goes...to a silly degree.  I have drawn the line at one maybe two changes, I have waited to ask for her order until the boys have been served and she can see the options, but then she is usually so distraught by being told no or wait until I get the boy&#39;s breakfast, that she refuses either option and wastes BOTH the pancakes and burrito....grrrrrr.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is usually with the younger two and I get it that they are young, that they want what they see or smell, or frankly what they don&#39;t have...but all my kids think nothing of asking for food and then not eating it and not wanting it later when it is saved for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we are on a limited budget and I am beginning to count how many slices of bread ($$$) or meat ($$$) sandwiches get thrown away everyday (and then they are hungry 2 minutes later).  I make some of my own bread and cook big birds for sandwich meat, but still...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am wasting money and our time (sometimes breakfast takes a long time...when I would rather be reading or playing with them!!) on this and I am wondering what other people think of this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDanka, Allison</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43390,"nextTopicId":43360}}
