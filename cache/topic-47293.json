I know I am an ultra-newbie, but I am already seeing <br/>\npositive changes in my kids and it is so encouraging.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if you remember, but I had mentioned my 10 yo and 13 yo boys being <br/>\nvery competitive and mean to each other - well, since I am not enforcing a <br/>\nbedtime, they have been staying up late together to watch TV.  I have heard them <br/>\nin there laughing, playing and wrestling - having FUN together for the last two <br/>\nnights!!!  That hasn&#39;t happened in a really long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday I noticed my 13yo joking and playing with the younger kids.  For a while <br/>\nnow he has just treated them as annoyances, so I was really happy about this, <br/>\ntoo.  I can tell he is a lot less stressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday the 13yo 10 yo and 6 yo decided they needed to exercise, so they spent <br/>\ntime running on the treadmill, doing situps and pushups!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been loving that I can say &quot;yes&quot; more often.  A lot more often.  In the <br/>\npast, I would not have let them use the treadmill.  While making breakfast the <br/>\nother day, the little ones wanted to hold an egg.  In the past I would have said <br/>\n&quot;no!&quot; but I gave them the carton and let them look all they wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on and on...but I am just really excited, and really happy (instead <br/>\nof stressed) for the first time in a long time!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nKristie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47258,"nextTopicId":47300}}
