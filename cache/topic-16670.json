After 5 bad years of school for my son, and 4 <br/>\nbad ones for my daughter, we are beginning our journey into <br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling.  I was wondering if anyone could tell me <br/>\nhow to &quot;get started&quot;, and how it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my kids have been bullied, my son getting the worst of it.  <br/>\nAfter this year, my husband and I felt that it was best to pull the <br/>\nkids from public schools, and homeschool them, from here on out.  I <br/>\nknow there are verying degrees of unschooling, I guess what I would <br/>\nlike to know from you all, is what has worked for you, and what <br/>\nhasn&#39;t.  I want the kids to learn from every day things, things they <br/>\nneed to survive in the world, when they get older.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have watched them, and volunteered at their school since my son <br/>\nwas in kindergarten.  I have seen what it has done to him, and his <br/>\nself esteem.  Both of my kids are good kids (I know alot of parents <br/>\nsay that about their kids), and they deserve to be free to learn <br/>\nabout the things they are interested in- no things like bees, <br/>\nfiddler crabs, etc.  I was hoping to get some info, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help and time.  Hope to hear from you all soon.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16676,"nextTopicId":16642}}
