I come here as often as I <br/>\ncan for an anxiety buster...<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I made it through the kindergarten registration date and the <br/>\nfirst day of school without caving in!  My 5yo dd is home and happy.  <br/>\nAnd today the world looks so sweet and interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a few days ago I did have a moment of insanity after the kids and <br/>\nI visited friends and saw what the little girl did in kindergarten <br/>\nher first week.  Some quaint coloring pages, and writing practice on <br/>\nmanuscript paper.  Her name looked so neat and straight...<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know what&#39;s coming.  Over the next few days I kept thinking how <br/>\nnice it would be for Orion to write her name like that on manuscript <br/>\npaper, so I asked her if she wanted to write a letter to someone to <br/>\nmail (which we have done a few times before).  She sat down and <br/>\nquickly made a little card, which I acknowledged, but I also <br/>\nsuggested that this time, we use the manscript paper instead of a <br/>\npiece of colored computer paper, and send both to him.  So I wrote a <br/>\nfew words and sentences on a piece and told her to try to copy it to <br/>\npractice writing neatly, so Grandpa can easily read it.  I informed <br/>\nher that it is important to learn to write neatly so other people can <br/>\nread our words.  She said she writes her own way and I said that is <br/>\nfine when you write for yourself.  She proceeded to try copying the <br/>\nmy words, but had a really difficult time and soon became <br/>\nfrustrated.  I suggested she practice on a wipe-off manuscript board, <br/>\nwhich she did.  She worked on that a long time, but by then I had <br/>\nstarted to feel bad about the whole idea.  So when she decided she <br/>\nwas done I said she did not have to try it on the paper again, but <br/>\nshe said she wanted to.  Again, frustration.  I suggested that we <br/>\nsend the card she made Grandpa herself, with a picture and a nonsense <br/>\nsentence.  I put it in an envelope and addressed it for her.  I told <br/>\nher that from now on she can do it her own way, but suggetsed that <br/>\nperhaps she&#39;d like to practice her name on the lined paper <br/>\nsometimes?  She said okay, and went on her merry way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I wonder how much damage I did!  Alas, I got anxious seeing her <br/>\nlittle friend&#39;s schoolwork, and felt the need to compare.  But it was <br/>\nfleeting, and I came back to my senses.  I read a few pages in the <br/>\nUnschooliung Handbook and visited this list, and I think we are back <br/>\nin the hammock. I don&#39;t know what I would do without my antidotes.  <br/>\nWait, yes I do.  I&#39;d be cracking the whip and we&#39;d be running a race <br/>\nwith the rest of the pack.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa Z.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3128,"nextTopicId":3082}}
