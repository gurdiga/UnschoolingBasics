Even though it makes me look like an idiot and an evil<br/>\nmommy, I thought it might help someone else see what not to do!<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember how I was saying I make the boys go to taekwondo because they don¹t<br/>\nwant to quit, so they have to go in between.  Well, since I announced that<br/>\nthey can choose whether or not to go to taekwondo each class, the following<br/>\nhas happened.  The 8 yo has decided not to go at all, and wants to quit.  He<br/>\nalso decided he wants to try youth football and do more gymnastics (he does<br/>\nonce a week gymnastics and wants to do the Saturday class).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 13 yo said he didn¹t want to go anymore until his back stopped hurting.<br/>\nHis back has hurt for a couple months (!!).  I kept saying it was growing<br/>\npains because he grew several inches in the last several months.  But on<br/>\nThursday (the day after he said that) he was running into the house for<br/>\nsomething and that hurt it enough to where he was walking funny the rest of<br/>\nthe day.  I had been taking him to taekwondo with his back hurting for<br/>\nweeks, but I had talked to the teacher and he wasn¹t doing anything<br/>\nstrenuous that involved his back and was being careful.  Anyway, I took him<br/>\nto the dr on Friday, had xrays done, had more xrays done Tuesday, and am<br/>\ntaking him to an orthopedist next week.  They are not entirely sure what is<br/>\nwrong yet, but they said absolutely no taekwondo.  So far he plans to return<br/>\nto taekwondo when his back is better.  We¹ll see if he still feels that way<br/>\nthen :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOur evenings have been quite different!  Monday, Wednesday and Friday<br/>\nevenings at taekwondo was a way of life for 5 years!  Now I find myself with<br/>\nsome relaxing evenings at home; what a concept!<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31535,"nextTopicId":31565}}
