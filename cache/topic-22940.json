I will, however, recommend <br/>\nthat anyone having issues in this area read the book &quot;Toxic Inlaws&quot;  <br/>\n(there is also one titled Toxic Parents).  Toxic Inlaws gives <br/>\nsomething like 5 or 6 categories of toxicity that inlaws can bring <br/>\ninto our lives if we allow it.... my father in law fit clearly and <br/>\ndefinitely in ALL but ONE category... that&#39;s how psychotic he is!!   <br/>\nThe most liberating thing I ever read was in this book which clearly <br/>\nstates that as the daughter in law or son in law etc we do NOT have <br/>\nto LOVE our inlaws!   I had felt so lacking and so small because I <br/>\ncould not love this man who was verbally, physically,and emotionally <br/>\nabusive to my husband and although not physically abusive to me and <br/>\nmy children he was verbally and emotionally abusive if we were around <br/>\nhim for more than 5 minutes on many occassions.    I really felt that <br/>\nI should feel bad for him that he was such a miserable human being <br/>\nbut I just couldn&#39;t after years of watching him attack my family I <br/>\nhad nothing left for him at all... I can&#39;t even work up a good <br/>\nold &quot;hate your guts&quot;  for this pathetic man these days.    It felt <br/>\nwonderful to be validated by this book by being told I could feel <br/>\nsorry that our relationship wasn&#39;t better but I didn&#39;t have to love <br/>\nhim and I didn&#39;t have to feel bad for not allowing him access to my <br/>\nfamily.   <br/>\nI did protect my children from this man and he still found ways to <br/>\nhurt them, I was careful for a long time not to say negative things <br/>\nabout him because I think that every human has the right to have a <br/>\nchance to change and to present that changed person to the world.   <br/>\nAfter him showing time and time again he was not to be trusted it <br/>\nbecame my JOB to keep him away from my children no matter what.   My <br/>\nkids don&#39;t trust him nor do they want to be around him at all... we <br/>\nhave an occasional visit with him (we never are alone at his house <br/>\nwith him and control every second of any visit he pays to our house)  <br/>\nMy kids will say hello and then disappear to do their own thing.   My <br/>\nhusband used to try to force them to sit and visit because he felt <br/>\nthat was the polite thing to do ... during one visit he told my <br/>\noldest that he didn&#39;t think we had made any arrangements to pay for <br/>\nher college so she should look for a scholarship (not sure where he <br/>\ngets the idea that we are destitute other than us not taking his <br/>\nmoney)  and then told my second oldest basically that she should do a <br/>\nvet tech program at a community college because she wouldn&#39;t be able <br/>\nto get into a veternarian program (he is bitter because he didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave the chops for it) I was very proud of my future vet who looked <br/>\nhim in the eye and told him very clearly that she would be a vet if <br/>\nthat&#39;s what she wanted to do.  My husband&#39;s aunt and uncle constantly <br/>\ntell him how he should call his dad, he should visit etc etc etc.  He <br/>\ncalls this man every single Saturday and visits him more frequently <br/>\nthan I like (most times we do not join him in the visit)  but his <br/>\nfamily is given the impression that we never have contact with him at <br/>\nall.   My husband finally told his aunt and uncle that he was sure <br/>\nphones worked both ways and that his father had to drive right by our <br/>\nhouse to visit his sister who he visits frequently so it was an equal <br/>\nopportunity &quot;give a damn&quot; and that the subject was closed for <br/>\ndiscussion!   It&#39;s so hard to cut people like that out of your <br/>\nlife... mental illness is a sad thing especially for those that are <br/>\nso psychotic they think everyone else is crazy and they are the <br/>\nnormal ones!   <br/>\nLisa B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":58929735,"authorName":"Schafer Vanessa","from":"Schafer Vanessa &lt;psychomom95@...&gt;","profile":"psychomom95","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: non Grandparent relationships","postDate":"1175694238","msgId":22987,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY0NjA3MC44MTA4Ny5xbUB3ZWI2MDgxOS5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGV1dTdmYStvcXR2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22982,"nextInTopic":23000,"prevInTime":22986,"nextInTime":22988,"topicId":22940,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I agree with you.

My house, and<br/>\ntrailer have never been that messy.  My kids had lots<br/>\nof toys, but I looked at it as ways for them to learn,<br/>\nand have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mil came over a couple of years ago, to borrow<br/>\nsomething from dh for his brother. Dh let her come in<br/>\nthe house, and she had to comment on the paint color I<br/>\nchose for my kitchen.  I don&#39;t need her approval or<br/>\nask for it.  I don&#39;t care what she thinks, it&#39;s my<br/>\nhouse, and we will decorate it how we want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did talk to my fil once and told him what my<br/>\nproblems were, and he said nothing.  My husband even<br/>\ntalked to both of his parents (mainly his mom) and<br/>\ntold her I didn&#39;t like the constant advice, and didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant it.  It wasn&#39;t only that, but the mean spirited<br/>\ncomments she would make to me, when dh wasn&#39;t there. <br/>\nI would tell him, and he would just shrug it off,<br/>\nuntil she made a comment about my clean floor, and<br/>\ntaking a picture of it.  That ended dh&#39;s side of the<br/>\nfamily Christmas at my house.  I worked my butt off,<br/>\nand all I would get is complaints about something I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t do right, or something I didn&#39;t have to serve. <br/>\nI finally couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  In fact, I came<br/>\nclose to telling them to leave on Christmas Eve,<br/>\nbefore everyone else came over.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow because of their non-involvement with my kids<br/>\n(ages 9 and 11), my kids want nothing to do with them.<br/>\n Kids are alot smarter than some adults give them<br/>\ncredit for.

My bio-dad went <br/>\nto prison when I was 11 for incest.  I was in my early 20&#39;s when he <br/>\nwas released and moved back to MY town (he was on the other side of <br/>\nthe state...over 6 hours away).  I was a basket case and vowed he <br/>\nwould never lay eyes on my children.  I begged my DH to move <br/>\naway...we just had no way to make it work...we were stuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, my grandmother (though very verbally abusive herself) <br/>\nbegged me to let him into our lives.  She said that &quot;he did his <br/>\ntime&quot; and to &quot;forgive and forget&quot;...etc. etc. much of the same stuff <br/>\nyou probably hear/d.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was the last straw when I discovered that my grandmother was <br/>\nsecretly sneaking my children to see him!  She was supposed to be <br/>\nbabysitting while she ran some errands...what she failed to mention <br/>\nwas that her errands consisted of dropping off some groceries to my <br/>\nbio-dad&#39;s apartment...while he was home!<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, I never let my children visit my grandmother <br/>\nwithout me or DH being present again.  We even stopped sending her <br/>\npictures because I didn&#39;t want my bio-dad to even know what my kids <br/>\nlooked like just in case he happened across them in public.  It got <br/>\nto the point that my DH had to ask my grandmother not even to talk <br/>\nabout him around me.  After that I didn&#39;t hear from her again until <br/>\nmy bio-dad died in 2003...about 4 years!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the funeral my grandmother started visiting again.  But she <br/>\nstill was obsessed with my bio-dad and kept acting like he was still <br/>\nalive...and that I should forgive him.  Though I had grown and <br/>\nhealed a lot in the 4 year lapse, I was still uncomfortable with <br/>\nconversation concering him.  So again, DH had to ask my grandmother <br/>\nto stop discussing him around me...and again we didn&#39;t hear from her <br/>\nfor another 3 years!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis last summer we helped my aunt to move her back to NJ and into a <br/>\nretirement apartment complex.  Cleaning out and packing up her TN <br/>\napartment was somewhat of a torment for me because it contained SO <br/>\nMUCH of my bio-dad&#39;s stuff (he and she were/are extreme pack rats) <br/>\nand of course that made grandma want to talk about her &quot;darling&quot;.  I <br/>\nwent over a few times without DH and all she would do is talk about <br/>\nhim and I couldn&#39;t get anything done...so I had to make sure I only <br/>\ncame over with DH...she wouldn&#39;t dare talk about such things with DH <br/>\nthere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs hard as it was, I loved my children much more than I loved <br/>\nmy &quot;family&quot; ties.  It was my duty to protect them from any threat I <br/>\nsaw fit.  Though my bio-dad served his time for the state...that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t make what he did any less evil and him less distrustful.  I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t going to take any chances and put temptation (my kids) in his <br/>\npath.  And even though grandma never physically harmed anyone, <br/>\nher &quot;white-washing&quot; was just as damaging to my healing.  She thought <br/>\nshe was &quot;protecting&quot; her son but she didn&#39;t realize that she was <br/>\ndistroying her granddaughter...and it seemed like she didn&#39;t even <br/>\ncare.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEven a rabid dog can behave well enough to get someone to come close <br/>\nenough to bite!  Call me harsh, but I just don&#39;t belive sexual <br/>\npreditors can &quot;change&quot; or be cured...not even with all the therapy <br/>\nin the world.  It&#39;s a flaw in their souls that they have no control <br/>\nover and once they&#39;ve assaulted there is no going back...dorment <br/>\nperiods, yes...but no going back, it only gets worse <br/>\n(excalation)...by my opinion and statistical evidence.  I would <br/>\nrather play safe than sorry!  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have uneasy feelings about that person that is all you need <br/>\nto justify your stance.  Talk to your mom honestly and let her know <br/>\nexactly what you feel and think...she might just come around.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf not, tell her that she is welcome in your home anytime...IF she <br/>\npromises to leave your brother out of the conversations.  Tell her <br/>\nthat you would appriciate her understanding your feelings and the <br/>\ndecision not to persue a relationship with your brother.  Then thank <br/>\nher for cooperating with your wishes in advance because you would <br/>\nhate to have to break ties with her.  And if she doesn&#39;t cooperate <br/>\nfirst offer a reminder...second time, break ties for a while.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRemember you&#39;re not asking her to &quot;give up&quot; your brother...you&#39;re <br/>\njust asking her not to &quot;share&quot; him with your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that is just my perspective...<br/>\nJulie Peters</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227739966,"authorName":"Julie Peters","from":"&quot;Julie Peters&quot; &lt;julieannpeters@...&gt;","profile":"julie_a_peters","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: non Grandparent relationships","postDate":"1175626026","msgId":22974,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV1dTdmYStvcXR2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGV1dTQxZCs1cWw3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22973,"nextInTopic":22975,"prevInTime":22973,"nextInTime":22975,"topicId":22940,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh, and my parents are not allowed in my house, yard, or driveway!

You would think we would see them all the time.  <br/>\nBut the reality is, if it is not &quot;anally&quot; scheduled down to the last <br/>\ndetail 2 months in advance, you can forget it...even then there&#39;s <br/>\nonly a slim chance.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve tried numerous times to invite them to things...picnics, <br/>\nplays, scouts, surgeries, etc. but there is always some other family <br/>\n(church, strangers, neighbors) that is more important/urgent, so <br/>\nthey cancel.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd IF we did happen to get together, it was a power struggle with <br/>\nthe kids.

(My DD has always been their favorite and she <br/>\nrarely gets the same treatment...especially since she is not quite <br/>\nas hyper and inquisitive as DS.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe bad thing is DH and I felt powerless, because it would always <br/>\nstart out with &quot;when you are in nana/papa&#39;s house, these are the <br/>\nrules or THIS is how you WILL behave if you want to be here/with <br/>\nus&quot;.  Because we don&#39;t have those rules at our house DH and I don&#39;t <br/>\nenforce them...so my parents don&#39;t even consult us, they just take <br/>\npunishment into their own hands.  Many times we don&#39;t find out about <br/>\nit for weeks after it happened because the kids think they&#39;ve really <br/>\ndone something bad and are afraid to talk about it!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what really sets me off, is that they will BRAG about the kids <br/>\nuntil the cows come home to everyone and anyone who will stnad still <br/>\nlong enough to hear!!!!  What right do they have to brag if they <br/>\ndon&#39;t &quot;know&quot; the kids!!??  What bragging rights do they have to say <br/>\nhow well the kids behave/are raised, when they undermine everthing <br/>\nwe do (and they certainly haven&#39;t spent enough time with the kids to <br/>\nsay that *they* have rasised them)!!!???  Ugh, that just bugs me so <br/>\nmuch!  Especially, if me or DH goes to mention the kids to someone <br/>\nand they&#39;ve aready heard the story!  Am I jealous?  Maybe.  But I <br/>\nsure would like to be the first to compliment my kids than the last <br/>\none in the loop, so to speak.  So we started withholding <br/>\ninformation/updates on the kids from my parents...how sad is that?<br/>\n<br/>\nLast summer I finally got the guts to address the on going problem.  <br/>\nIt was really tough, even though most of the conversation was held <br/>\nin emails (since that is the only way we can ever get a &quot;real&quot; <br/>\nresponse from them).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI mentioned EVERYHTING that had left a sour taste since DH and I got <br/>\nmarried.  Even down to the fact that my DS was 5 YEARS old before <br/>\nthey kept him without me or DH being there.  And that was only <br/>\nbecause my DH&#39;s father passed away and we had to make an emergency <br/>\ntrip and didn&#39;t feel it was appropriate for the kids to come.  DH <br/>\nwalked into the bank and TOLD my mom we were going to OH and THEY <br/>\nwere GOING to keep the kids, no options!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome may think bringing everything up isn&#39;t wise, but my parents are <br/>\nVERY dense.  We have bluntly said things to them, hoping that it <br/>\nwill cultivate a conversation, the problem be addressed, and elicit <br/>\nchange.  Instead, they really thought we were talking about someone <br/>\nelse...DH&#39;s family maybe, but certainly not them, even though we <br/>\nuse &quot;YOU&quot;.  So I felt that I must to put everything out there and in <br/>\ncontext...to Spark their memory since there was a lot of &quot;we&#39;ve <br/>\nnever said/done/felt that&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was able to get my &quot;resentments&quot; off my chest and feel like I was <br/>\nmeeting them half way...because if they didn&#39;t know there was a <br/>\nproblem then how would it ever change?  The ball was in their court <br/>\nnow...it&#39;s up to them to want to come half way too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of all my emailed novels, we arranged to meet to discuss <br/>\neverything.  Going face-to-face was hard but it really wasn&#39;t so bad <br/>\nonce I pinned down what I needed and wanted from them.  In jist, I <br/>\nasked them if they wanted to leave the kids a legacy of &quot;schedules <br/>\nand lectures&quot; or of &quot;memories and love&quot;.  They seemed to take it <br/>\nwell and so things improved.<br/>\n  <br/>\nWe agreed to have 1 night a month as a family night and for them to <br/>\nstart having a relationship with the kids.  That meant making more <br/>\neffort to attend the kids&#39; invitations, spending kid-to-grandparent <br/>\ntime like fishing/picnics/etc., and keeping the kids over night on <br/>\noccasion (so DH and I could have an anniversary/birthday date <br/>\nwithout a curfew/having to come home...something we hadn&#39;t had since <br/>\nour honeymoon).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, things improved for about 2-3 months...actually, <br/>\nthey &quot;improved&quot; so much that we didn&#39;t know who these people <br/>\nwere...to the point of annoying!  We didn&#39;t have any privacy, we <br/>\nwere constantly getting calls, emails, drop-ins, &quot;let&#39;s make a <br/>\ndate&quot;, &quot;how about lunch&quot;, etc.  Don&#39;t get me wrong...we did want <br/>\nSOME of that, just not dumped on us all at once. Sometimes I feel <br/>\nlike they were purposely trying to annoy us, just to sabotage the <br/>\nwhole thing...and if that&#39;s the case...it certainly worked! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had talked in October and by the end of February everything went <br/>\nback to the way it always had been.  We had a family night in Nov. <br/>\nand Dec., Jan. was too hectic.  Feb. they came to a Scout meeting.  <br/>\nSince then...nothing.  No more planning family nights, no more <br/>\nanything.  The only thing that has lasted is DD and nana do &quot;art <br/>\nlessons&quot; every other Thursday night...which bugs me since as I <br/>\nmentioned, DD was always their favorite of the 2 kids.  On the flip <br/>\nside, DD isn&#39;t really into it that much, she likes art so she goes <br/>\nfor that...not really for nana.    <br/>\n<br/>\nMind you, I am somewhat relieved because I don&#39;t know how much more <br/>\nof the &quot;friendly parents&quot; I could have taken.  But now DH, the kids <br/>\nand I are &quot;over&quot; wanting a relationship with my parents.  We decided <br/>\nit would be better to not see them, feel some resentment and be/feel <br/>\nhonest, then to see them and everything be/feel fake.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve simply chalked up their &quot;behavior&quot; as ignorance.  We figure, <br/>\nsomeday they will look back and wonder where their &quot;grandbabies&quot; <br/>\nwent.  That they will realize they were the ones who let them slip <br/>\naway with all their rules and schedules.  That there was a time when <br/>\nthey had been given the chance to &quot;get back&quot; what they ere &quot;loosing&quot; <br/>\nbut they still chose their &quot;old-habits&quot; over our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll feel sad when they go through that time, but I will not feel <br/>\nguilty for the choices they made.  I did what I felt was right...I <br/>\nconfronted the problem, offered resolution, and stepped back.  Now <br/>\nthat their choice is clear, I have no worries about doing what is <br/>\nbest for our family...even if it doesn&#39;t include nana/papa.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow all this doesn&#39;t mean that we don&#39;t ever speak or see my <br/>\nparents.  But now, we are more aware of the &quot;pseudo-relationship&quot; <br/>\ngoing on and know not to try to seek out a meaningful relationship <br/>\nwith them anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie Peters</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: non Grandparent relationships","postDate":"1175619972","msgId":22972,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDcwNDAzMTcwNjEyLjk3MTE4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzODA3Lm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGV1dHB0Zytlbm1kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22971,"nextInTopic":22973,"prevInTime":22971,"nextInTime":22973,"topicId":22940,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t want my kids used to bad behavior.

If they&#39;ll &quot;see it eventually&quot;, better late than early. Why on earth would you want a young child to be exposed to hurtful behavior in order to learn the true colors of people that act ugly? It&#39;s our job to protect them from that until they can protect themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I didn&#39;t read that post to mean kids should be exposed to people being mean because we can&#39;t protect them from it forever.  I took it to mean, Mom doesn&#39;t need to feel like she should present the grandparents (and others) as if they&#39;re nice, good people when they aren&#39;t.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;d never tell my kids what exactly was said if their grandparents say unkind things about them -- and that has happened where both my parents are concerned.  I also, tho, don&#39;t go out of my way to tell them Zayde and G&#39;ma Toni are wonderful people who love them endlessly - because that simply isn&#39;t true.  My parents aren&#39;t particularly safe people, emotionally.  My Mom will turn on you in a minute if you piss her off -- it&#39;s just her way.  My Dad is narcissistic, and only &#39;loves&#39; others (even his kids) to the extent we/they fit his expectations and aggrandize him in ways he needs.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  All that said, I love both my parents and my kids do see them (tho Mama and I aren&#39;t keeping up these days).  There is good to be had in both those relationships, even if sometimes the only good thing is an object lesson in how not to be, and what kind of people you may run into in adulthood.  There&#39;s also the historical &#39;where we come from&#39; value in knowing their grandparents.  I walk a fine line, in my attempts to give both my kids and my parents what I think will bless them -- buy my loyalty is always with my kids. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  It&#39;s much harder with my inlaws.  They&#39;re neither narcissistic nor mean-spirited/bitter.  They are very mainstream and my mil is quite clueless about why anyone would ever make an alternative choice.  But, we&#39;re  making progress.  Just last week, she sent an email to Gary congratulating him on his Class A Truck Driver&#39;s license -- and he could see she is genuinely pleased/proud for him.  Huge progress, because just a few years ago, she was truly bewildered as to why he&#39;d want to be a truck driver -- the way you&#39;d ask someone why they&#39;d want to give up electricity or living indoors.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  With them, the grandhchild issue is more one of what I call benevolent malpractice -- they don&#39;t understand why we&#39;d do what we do, and think we&#39;re wrong.  Not because they wnat to bully us or tell us we&#39;re wrong, but they genuinely don&#39;t understand, tho they&#39;d like to.  So, they make inappropriate suggestions, out of a real desire to help us have what they naturally believe is best.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We&#39;ve just decided to invite them for a visit later this year -- they had called asking if one of the boys might be interested in a month in Hawaii this summer, but neither boy wants to go alone.  Andy has been alone three times and prefers to have us there to advocate for him; Dan just doesn&#39;t know his grandparents well enough to go alone.  Having both boys -- without us -- isn&#39;t really an option for them in their late 70&#39;s, which is why they invited only one boy (at our choice).  The inviting one child thing was hard to for me to understand the first time or two it came around (they hosted Will one summer, too, when he was 13), but they only had Gary, so they&#39;ve never &#39;raised&#39; two kids at a time.   They did host a trio of 13yo cousins about 18 yrs ago  -- but they were much younger then, too.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  If they come for a visit, there will be no keeping unschooling under wraps -- we&#39;ve not even used the &quot;u&quot; word with them -- Gary is convinced his Mom would literally have a heart attack &lt;g&gt; but he&#39;s bracing for that if/when they visit next.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for earth-friendly autos? <br/>\n Browse Top Cars by &quot;Green Rating&quot; at Yahoo!

Don&#39;t let her get to you or<br/>\n&gt; let rude comments like that <br/>\n&gt; be your last straw.  She&#39;s not worth it.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I believe it was Audrey Hepburn who said that no one<br/>\n&gt; can make us feel <br/>\n&gt; inferior without our permission. If my MIL said<br/>\n&gt; anything about my floor I&#39;d giggle <br/>\n&gt; and let her know that if its an issue for her, she<br/>\n&gt; is free to get on her knees <br/>\n&gt; and scrub it.  I&#39;d even invite her to come by daily<br/>\n&gt; to keep up with the floor. <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d probably start calling her grandma-rella and<br/>\n&gt; break into song. Years ago <br/>\n&gt; when we moved from FL to my MIL&#39;s town I read Phil<br/>\n&gt; McGraw&#39;s Life Strategies.  I <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t retain much from the book except that we have<br/>\n&gt; the power to set up <br/>\n&gt; relationships the way we want.  Set things up so it<br/>\n&gt; works for you.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Because words can hurt deeply and can leave a<br/>\n&gt; lasting stain, if someone ever <br/>\n&gt; called my kid fat I&#39;d remind my child that he/she is<br/>\n&gt; PERFECT and tell that <br/>\n&gt; person that it isn&#39;t nice to say mean things to<br/>\n&gt; people. If you want a subtle jab <br/>\n&gt; at the *abuser&#39;s* ignorance you might ignore the<br/>\n&gt; person who said it and speak <br/>\n&gt; to them through your child:  Sorry about Grandpa<br/>\n&gt; being so mean, someone must <br/>\n&gt; have been very mean to him for him to have learned<br/>\n&gt; to treat others like that. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; We have a 180 LB 10 year old in our neighborhood who<br/>\n&gt; has been one of my <br/>\n&gt; scouts for 5 years.  I&#39;ve watched her go from a<br/>\n&gt; sweet, gentle kid to a mean, nasty, <br/>\n&gt; hostile, hateful young girl.  She has sustained<br/>\n&gt; years of cruelty and abuse <br/>\n&gt; and it really does make for a very unhappy person. <br/>\n&gt; Mean people suck but it <br/>\n&gt; helps to remind ourselves that they have a lot of<br/>\n&gt; baggage. I remind myself daily <br/>\n&gt; that she needs to be treated with a gentle heart but<br/>\n&gt; sometimes I want to wring <br/>\n&gt; her neck!  Same with my MIL and SIL.  They are<br/>\n&gt; messed up, unhappy people. <br/>\n&gt; Pitiful people. Just another reason to be grateful<br/>\n&gt; that we&#39;re not!<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Peace and don&#39;t let her get to you and if she tries,<br/>\n&gt; stop her in her tracks!<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Good luck,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Robin, who plans to be a great MIL someday.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ************************************** See what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   Vanessa  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nDon&#39;t pick lemons.<br/>\nSee all the new 2007 cars at Yahoo!

You might look for <br/>\nother &quot;neutral&quot; places to meet together, if you want to try to <br/>\ncontinue the relationship. It may be that the kids will enjoy their <br/>\ncompany more somewhere other than the grands&#39; house - but again, <br/>\nthat&#39;s going to depend on the grands being willing to meet y&#39;all <br/>\nsomewhere else. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They love my <br/>\n&gt; parents, and love visiting them.

My dh has had a talk with <br/>\nhis brother telling him that his parents will ooh and ahhh over <br/>\nother peoples kids (ones that are in the family) right in front of <br/>\nmy kids, and not pay any attention to mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre kids at ages 9 and 11 ok to make up their own minds to not want <br/>\nto see their grandparents?  I don&#39;t want to force them to go, <br/>\nbecause I feel that it will backfire on my husband.  My kids have <br/>\nnever had a relationship with my in-laws, but have always had one <br/>\nwith my parents who live 550 miles away from us.  The ones here in <br/>\ntown never call, and are always too busy to see the kids.  We did <br/>\ninvite them to school functions when my kids were in ps, and they <br/>\nwent to a few, but not many.  I would always have to explain to my <br/>\nkids why their grandparents wouldn&#39;t come, and I found myself in the <br/>\nmiddle, and trying to find reasons why.  It came to the point of us <br/>\nnot inviting my in-laws to any school funtion.  It was easier, since <br/>\nthey showed no interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help on this would be greatly appreciated.  They love my <br/>\nparents, and love visiting them.  It&#39;s not the same with their other <br/>\ngrandparents.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nVanessa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22990,"nextTopicId":23008}}
