The sad thing is that she does have a following, especially with her new career as a children&#39;s author, and she&#39;s using that notoriety to push the same old agenda that kids need to be controlled and punished.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m a little surprised to hear that, with all her money, her kids even have to think about laundry. And the very idea that she forces her daughter to re-earn clean clothes is so sad.  Of course, here I am watching Dan spend day after day in the same outfit, until finally I ask him to at least put on a clean shirt because he&#39;s starting to look like no one loves and cares for him.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!
