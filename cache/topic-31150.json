We have done this  <br/>\nall along.  When our daughter was a baby, I worked a few mornings a  <br/>\nweek, and we had the quick &quot;baby-toss&quot; then he would go to work.  Our  <br/>\ndecision to homeschool evolved out of our desire to not give her away  <br/>\nto teachers!  We like being with her and with each other!!  We call  <br/>\nit Mommy Day, Daddy Day, Mommy Day, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk about what we did for the day, so that we know what&#39;s  <br/>\nhappening (as most families do over dinner!), but usually my husband  <br/>\nand daughter do different types of things on their days.  I am more  <br/>\nextroverted and tend to schedule more activities, classes, play  <br/>\ndates, etc.  He usually does projects at home or goes out into  <br/>\nnature.  It depends on where the intersection or her interests and  <br/>\nand ours intersect.  For example, my husband and daughter both play  <br/>\nviolin; she and I like to sew.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more relaxed we have gotten over the last couple years,  letting  <br/>\ngo more and more about ideas of how homeschooling/learning should  <br/>\nlook,  the easier everything has been.
