As soon as she could (maybe 24 mo?) she would<br/>\nescape from the restraint every time.  Usually when we were on the highway.<br/>\nEventually she was old enough to understand our reasons behind using them<br/>\nand she often complied just because she knew it would make me happy but<br/>\nthere was a long period when she simply refused. I tried everything I could<br/>\nthink of plus all the ideas from unschoolers I knew - it was very<br/>\nfrustrating.  One thing that an unschooling Dad said that made sense was.&quot;<br/>\nShe has the right to refuse to wear them but I have the right to refuse to<br/>\ndrive the car with an unbelted passenger.  It isn&#39;t safe, it&#39;s against the<br/>\nlaw and I won&#39;t risk it.&quot;  This approach, in the end was very effective but<br/>\nunbelievably inconvenient for me and unfair to big brother and sis who<br/>\ndidn&#39;t wish to be house bound for months at a time.  Sometimes the choice<br/>\nwas, you can come with us if you stay belted but if not you can stay here<br/>\nwith dad or go visit a neighbor while we go out.  Sometimes I was able to<br/>\narrange rides for the other two.  Sometimes we just went anyway and crossed<br/>\nour fingers. <br/>\n\tFWIW, Anika is the one who still always gets carsick on long trips<br/>\nand who hated car rides even as an infant.<br/>\n<br/>\nKrisula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6373,"nextTopicId":6249}}
