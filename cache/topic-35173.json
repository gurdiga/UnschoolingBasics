Groups that <br/>\nwe joined just before we went. One was NZ Unschoolers and the other was a regular <br/>\nhomeschooling group--I can&#39;t remember the name though. I&#39;d recommend getting on <br/>\nthose groups before you go so you can set up some meetings. We ended up meeting so <br/>\nmany families that way. It was the highlight of our trip. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Shell, who is on this list, is in Auckland. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be happy to hook you up, <br/>\nmeet with you, etc. Visit her blog at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unschoolersanonymous.blogspot.com/.\">http://unschoolersanonymous.blogspot.com/.</a> She&#39;s a <br/>\ngreat source of information and a lovely person to be around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want recommendations on places to go around Auckland I&#39;d love to share some of <br/>\nour favorite spots with you. Just send me an e-mail directly if you&#39;re interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you have a great trip!<br/>\n<br/>\nColleen<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thenewunschooler.blogspot.com/\">http://thenewunschooler.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Alison Broadbent &lt;abzb@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re going to be in the Auckland area for 2 weeks in Sept.
