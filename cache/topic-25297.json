But please allow me to<br/>\nshare something<br/>\nwith you real quick. To me, your choice of words here is argumentative and<br/>\nprovocative.<br/>\nWhen I just read it to reply - mind you I already read it once earlier today<br/>\n- I could feel<br/>\nsomething like my heart rate increasing, or my &quot;blood pressure rising&quot; as<br/>\nthey say. It&#39;s the<br/>\nsame feeling I feel when I&#39;m angry, so I guess I could say I feel really<br/>\nangry at your choice<br/>\nof words. Like I said, I sincerely appreciate your desire to advise, but I<br/>\njust don&#39;t see the<br/>\ntone here as helpful. Combines with another person&#39;s reply, it very nearly<br/>\nhad me want to<br/>\nsay &quot;forget it.&quot; And I would not be saying &quot;forget it&quot; to a journey<br/>\nexploring what&#39;s best for<br/>\nmy kids, but rather &quot;forget it&quot; to seeking information here. I hope you will<br/>\ntake that<br/>\nfeedback in the spirit in which it was meant, and not make it about me being<br/>\nresistant to<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re saying. On the contrary, I am open to the concepts, but the<br/>\ndelivery could get<br/>\nin the way.<br/>\n-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to speak to this, as it is something that *I* have felt and dealt<br/>\nwith, I assume the most of us have.<br/>\nIn my experience, this increased blood pressure at something someone else<br/>\nhas written, is the first step to an epiphany in my parenting concepts.<br/>\nFirst thing, I will re-read the words using a different voice -- the gentle<br/>\nsweet auntie voice is my favorite -- to see if it is MY interpretation of<br/>\nthe &quot;tone&quot; or the words themselves. Most often, the reaction in me is my own<br/>\nchorus of voices responding to the words. I have found it difficult at times<br/>\nto express my ideas with the &quot;tone&quot; I would use if I were speaking<br/>\nface-to-face; I have to let the words do their job and hope that my words<br/>\nwill not be read with the voice of the cranky old schoolteacher or<br/>\njudgmental stranger.<br/>\nWhen ideas turn into a *hot button* with my emotions, I know this is a place<br/>\nin great need of deep contemplation, followed by a spark in my actions -- so<br/>\nthat my thoughts AND actions are in line with my goal of honoring my family<br/>\nand our unschooling lifestyle.<br/>\nBreathing, revisiting, breathing, exploring, breathing, accepting,<br/>\nbreathing, breathing...<br/>\nthat&#39;s the pattern I follow :)<br/>\nIt also helps to remember the words, though sparked by your words/situation,<br/>\nare out here for the whole of the community and are generally not meant for<br/>\nyou alone, but for anyone in the same place of stuckness.<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\nhannahbearski.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25285,"nextTopicId":25242}}
