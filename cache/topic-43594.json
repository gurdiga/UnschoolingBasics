Zoe was around 18 months old (I think). Inexpensive was also high on my list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted our move to be an adventure, not just something that stressed out the adults in her life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMegan is a huge animal lover and I planned our route to take us through Las Vegas because going to Vegas was a big deal to her. I&#39;m not sure why, lol. But she really wanted to walk along the strip at night. So we did. We also visited the M&M store and saw the tigers at the MGM Grand hotel. That was the free stuff. We paid to see Siegfried & Roys animal exhibit (big cats & dolphins). It may seem tacky & over the top to some, bit it was magic for Megan.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was probably more we could have done, but we were moving with a cat & a rabbit in late Spring....stopping anywhere for long meant the animals could have overheated. My husband was also stressed about the logistics of the move, so I was really working on balancing the fun & work aspects of the move. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess where you stop depends on how far you want to drive in a day and what might interest the members of your family and how much *play time* your finances can handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t forget that kind of driving can be really tiring & planning an extra day here and there is a good idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nGwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Apr 8, 2010, at 4:53 AM, &quot;stephanie&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scruffybc@...\">scruffybc@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nHello Everyone!<br/>\nI am wondering if anyone is familiar with or has any info on something I vaguely remember from a few years ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember hearing/reading about some sort of unschooling/homeschooling through the &#39;brown road signs&#39; those historical sites signs across the country.
