Like<br/>\nWendy, I found out that my daughter also freaked out over the drain.  We had<br/>\nwatched a Pooh video story where Tigger actually goes down the drain and she<br/>\nthought it would suck all her bath toys and her down it too!  Took a while<br/>\nto figure out that was the problem.  And my son hated the bath which turned<br/>\nout to be all about rinsing his hair.  We came up with the solution of<br/>\ndipping him back over the sink after the bath and rinsing that way which he<br/>\nwasn&#39;t thrilled about but could tolerate - took the sting out of the whole<br/>\nthing.  So I recommend that first.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can give you some things that worked for us, but if there&#39;s an &quot;issue&quot;<br/>\nthey likely won&#39;t work.  I&#39;m not sure how you approach it, but I have some<br/>\ndifferent things that tend to work (and we usually get to a bath once a week<br/>\nor so)... sometimes instead of asking my children about taking a bath which<br/>\nalways gets resistance, I just run one!  Then I hang out in the bathroom a<br/>\nwhile which is destined to bring them in looking for me.  When they see the<br/>\nbath with all the bubbles, one of them is likely to just decide to go in<br/>\n(not always, but pretty often).  It takes me asking out of the equation and<br/>\njust sort of puts the bath in their path.  The other game we played for a<br/>\nwhile but which doesn&#39;t work so well anymore was sort of the &#39;reverse<br/>\npsychology&#39; game they learned from an uncle.  They loved it if I ran a bath,<br/>\nsaid it was only for me and no stinky kids allowed, no way no how were they<br/>\nto get into that bath - they would run to get in giggling.  Also, they<br/>\nconsider it a &quot;treat&quot; to bathe with their cousins at their houses.  So<br/>\nsometimes if the going gets tough, I schedule a visit (luckily they have<br/>\nnearby cousins, could work with friends too) and organize a mass bathing.  I<br/>\nknow you said he doesn&#39;t like sponge bathing.  What about diaper wipes to<br/>\nwipe him down?<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the waterless dog shampoo idea!  I think I&#39;ve seen waterless regular<br/>\nsoaps out there too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Millie Rosa [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:willsmamamillie@...\">willsmamamillie@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 11, 2004 7:18 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] please help me to get him bathed<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Will hates the bath.

His brother did the same thing and when he got older, he <br/>\nstopped on his own, so don&#39;t fret over that one.  <br/>\n  I don&#39;t know how to get your little computer expert in the tub, shower, <br/>\npool!  Any kids (brothers , cousins) that could try getting him in with them, or <br/>\ndad maybe?  <br/>\n  You might gently try to explain that he&#39;s getting pretty dirty and the dirt <br/>\ngets you beds and you all have to sleep in that.  Or in kid friendly way <br/>\nexplain he needs to bathe for his skins health.  <br/>\n  I don&#39;t know, i&#39;m just rattling here as my own ds is talking to me!<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\nsyndi<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...since we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>\nis senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn out <br/>\npeople who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to <br/>\nlearn whatever needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>\n-- John Holt<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: please help me to get him bathed","postDate":"1087001264","msgId":639,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg1LmUyYzk3YzMuMmRmYmFjYjBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":637,"nextInTopic":641,"prevInTime":638,"nextInTime":640,"topicId":633,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/11/2004 8:45:34 PM Eastern Daylight Time, crystal.pina@verizon.net writes: One  thing I do know is that if it is the bath itself, wash him","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-851782900\">In a message dated 6/11/2004 8:45:34 PM Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crystal.pina@...\">crystal.pina@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nOne  thing I do know is that if it is the bath itself, wash him from <br/>\nthe feet  up.

ANd tho my mom and others think it is neglectful, I do not force him in the tub.  For a while I could get him in there once a week or so with me if I promised not to wash his hair.  But now it is nothing doing.  I have purchased every cool tub toy I can find, put food color, bubbles, fizz tablets, etc in there, tried to get him in the shower...everything I can think of.  It has been nearly a month since I could talk him in there!  I sponge bathe him as much as I can...he isn&#39;t amenable to that either....I usually do it when he is dead asleep.  I bought a pool for the yard, thought he might like that better but no.  This morning I saw a potato patch under his arm and he STINKS and I have to sleep right next to him.  And we have a family reunion this weekend...everyone already thinks I am terrible for still nursing him and cosleeping....guess we just won&#39;t go....but I have to bathe this kid!  What should I do?  I am getting close to forcing him and I don&#39;t want<br/>\n to...but I need to wash him!
