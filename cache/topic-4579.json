It was an incredible experience to be with so many people who parent like Ren and Kelli and to see how that works when we all get together!  Oh, if only the whole world could be like that conference!  In one room there were the speakers and in another room, right next door, there were the &quot;fun shops&quot;  which are laid back presentations, crafting sessions, or just groups of people meeting up because of a common interest like Yu-Gi-Oh.  There was also a separate room for the toddlers to run around in.  If this were any other conference, you&#39;d expect the kids to be in the fun shops and the parents to be listening to the speakers, but at this conference children are taken seriously!  So, there were a lot of people &quot;out of place.&quot;  The kids were welcome to walk into the speaker&#39;s room, find their parent or their friend.  I saw parents calmly tending to their children instead of telling them to hush.  Mommas nursed their babies and nobody looked at them funny.  People, grown-ups and kids, came and went as they wanted.  People hung out at the pool.  It was awesome.  And I haven&#39;t even mentioned the speakers!  If you want to be reassured about unschooling, the speakers will do that for you.  But I really think being around all the other unschoolers will also help.  You need to go and just breath that non-judgemental air!!  <br/>\nDeirdre<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    Date: Tue, 04 Jan 2005 18:26:48 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;cartoontv5&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LJeanne28@...\">LJeanne28@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Conference question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi.Would you guys mind telling me what goes on at the conference?
