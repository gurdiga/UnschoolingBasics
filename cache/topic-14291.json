He <br/>\ntold about some of the guys he met in the dads group, and how maybe <br/>\nwe can try to hook up with people when we&#39;re camping (or plan our <br/>\ncamping trips around visiting people eventually).  Then he talked <br/>\nabout how so many of the people we know (&quot;old&quot; friends, not <br/>\nunschoolers), people we hardly ever see, people we thought were <br/>\nfriends have been so hard to get together with.  It seems that WE&#39;RE <br/>\nalways the ones making the effort.   I said, well we&#39;ve got a who <br/>\nbunch of NEW unschooler friends all over the country (and the world <br/>\nfor that matter!) and if you want to meet them in one place, the L&L <br/>\nConference is in NM in Sep.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I about fell off my chair when he said &quot;sure, why not!   We <br/>\ncould do that!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was SO excited, but.....my dd does NOT want to go.  We were in a <br/>\nrestaurant, so I couldn&#39;t really have a meaningful conversation with <br/>\nher about it, but I WILL later on when we can have some quiet time <br/>\ntogether.   I&#39;m trying not to be upset, but inside, I&#39;ll admit, I <br/>\nAM.   Part of me is saying, &quot;hey!  That&#39;s the WHOLE POINT of pulling <br/>\nyou out of school, and deschooling, healing, trying to live a joyful <br/>\nlife&quot; etc, but I don&#39;t think she has any concept at all of <br/>\nthe &quot;living a joyful unschooling life&quot; that I see as what I want for <br/>\nour family!   Yes, if we had ALWAYS lived this way, it would be <br/>\nsecond nature or not even an issue, but it&#39;s still foreign to her.   <br/>\nAlso, she&#39;s an introvert, hates transitions and new places etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m SO happy, but also VERY discouraged at the same time.   Any <br/>\nwords of wisdom to help me put this in perspective and address it in <br/>\na meaningful way when we&#39;re able to talk about it?<br/>\nJann</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14128,"nextTopicId":14296}}
