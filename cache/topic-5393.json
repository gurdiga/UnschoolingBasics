My daughter struggles with certain issues in school (mostly <br/>\nnot fitting into the &quot;typical learner&quot; i.e. she doesn&#39;t learn well <br/>\nsequentially, which is how many teach), plus the organization, rules <br/>\netc and especially has difficulty with math.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m expected to work all this extra time with her at home because <br/>\nshe can&#39;t get it right at school, then I might as well teach her <br/>\nmyself at home!  More of the same (repetition, busy work etc) does <br/>\nnot work for my daughter.  We sometimes need to find another way, but <br/>\nonce she learns it, it&#39;s permanent.  Then she wants to move on.  Part <br/>\nof it is boredom too.<br/>\n<br/>\nRant away!  We call in venting in our house!<br/>\nJann</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":169847153,"authorName":"blessed54321@wmconnect.com","from":"blessed54321@...","profile":"blessed543212003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Just need to rant!","postDate":"1113336650","msgId":5394,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1LjRmMzg0MDYwLjJmOGQ4NTRhQHdtY29ubmVjdC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5393,"nextInTopic":5416,"prevInTime":5393,"nextInTime":5395,"topicId":5393,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/12/2005 2:48:13 PM SA Pacific Standard Time, ... i totally understand,, my 4   kids have run the gamut ofpublic and private schhool,and it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-784618773\">In a message dated 4/12/2005 2:48:13 PM SA Pacific Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamperedmichelle@...\">pamperedmichelle@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Emily declaring her independence from school.)

We&#39;ve been through divorces, deaths, <br/>\nbirths, celebrations of milestones, etc together.  Today, however, <br/>\none of the womyn posted about a problem her son was having in <br/>\nschool.  Not completing assignments and failing his class.  She <br/>\ncreated a contract that I found to be very harsh and with NO <br/>\npositive conditions, such as if he completes A,B,C he will be given <br/>\nsomething special.  Everything is &quot;you must do X,Y,Z or you won&#39;t <br/>\nget &quot;ordinary&quot; things&quot; (such as television, video games, computer <br/>\ntime.)  So I posted that before I would set up a penalizing contract <br/>\n(which IMO is setting this child up for only failure) I would find <br/>\nout what the root of the problem was.  Why wasn&#39;t her son completing <br/>\nthese assignments?  Why did he feel that lying about turning them in <br/>\nwas a good thing to do?  (Probably because if he had told the truth <br/>\nthat he hadn&#39;t it would have had severe consequences.)  :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nThis really hit home with me because I went through the same thing <br/>\nwith Emily last year.  She wasn&#39;t turning in assignments and failing <br/>\nher classes even though she was making 100% on all her tests (that <br/>\nis just bass ackwards if you ask me!) But I took a totally different <br/>\napproach.  Instead of blaming the child I blamed the school.  <br/>\nInstead of making my child do these assinine assignments I tried <br/>\nworking with the school on a compromise (which eventually led to <br/>\nEmily declaring her independence from school.)  I have just never <br/>\nunderstood why children need to spend 6-8 hours at school and come <br/>\nhome with 2+ hours of more assignments.  Seems to me if it can&#39;t be <br/>\ntaught in 6-8 hours the kid isn&#39;t going to get it in 2 more at <br/>\nhome.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;sigh&gt;  It just saddens me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5395,"nextTopicId":5409}}
