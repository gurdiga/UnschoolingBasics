It was really tough the first few years, particularly because both of us were working from home. My husband ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1641712523\">Hi Jamie,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI work from home, as does my husband. It was really tough the first few<br/>\nyears, particularly because both of us were working from home. My husband<br/>\ndesigns and builds furniture, I am a massage practitioner and also act as<br/>\nadministrator/bookkeeper for my bil&#39;s landscaping business. I started out<br/>\nworking during my eldest daughters nap times and after she went to bed. I<br/>\nwas exhausted all the time. I need at least 7 hours sleep, even if it&#39;s<br/>\nsomewhat broken sleep (we have a family bed, and my daughter flops like a<br/>\nfish on dry land :-)). I have since hired a trio of &quot;playmates&quot; - otherwise<br/>\nknown as sitters - who are young and enthusiastic and love to engage and<br/>\nplay with my kids. My office is in the main playroom of the house, so we&#39;re<br/>\nusually all together, unless my daughter chooses to play somewhere else.<br/>\n(Right now, she and &quot;her friend Kat&quot; are outside exploring the backyard,<br/>\nlooking for signs of spring and playing with the dog.) Having this trio has<br/>\nmade it possible for me to do my work without there being the tension<br/>\nbetween my work commitments and wanting/needing to be with the kids. They<br/>\nsitters are here anywhere from 12-20 hours/week, usually starting in the<br/>\nmornings, leaving our afternoons free to spend time with our unschooling<br/>\nfriends (none of whom even wake up before 10 am! LOL), play, paint, snuggle,<br/>\nwhatever we want. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have decent computer skills, there&#39;s a LOT you can do from home.<br/>\nDoing data entry for an Access or Excel system is a pretty straightforward<br/>\nthing to learn (hey, I did it and I started out as a computer illiterate!)<br/>\nand, depending on where you live, you can make anywhere from $20-30 and<br/>\nhour. As your skills grow, you can take on more responsibility, and make<br/>\nmore money. I started out doing just data entry and creating invoices, and<br/>\nhave grown into client relations (meaning, I chase down the money when<br/>\nclients don&#39;t pay on time :-)), tax preparation, quarterly sales tax filing,<br/>\nbill paying, etc. At this point I am being paid a percentage of my bil&#39;s<br/>\ngross. It&#39;s not something I could live on as an only income, but it makes a<br/>\nhuge difference when combined with my husbands. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else mentioned medical transcription. My sil does this, too. Again,<br/>\nif your skills are decent, and your learning curve is short, you can do<br/>\nokay, and even well with this.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there are the non-computer jobs like house/pet-sitting. My mom uses a<br/>\nyoung mother of 2 to care for her dog and cats, water her plants, take in<br/>\nthe mail, etc, while she is away. She pays (I believe) $12-15 a day for this<br/>\nservice, and the woman takes care of about 4 homes a day. Not a lot of money<br/>\non it&#39;s own, but again, when combined with her husband&#39;s income, it really<br/>\nmakes a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nUse your imagination, think about the things you love to do, and see how<br/>\nthose things can benefit someone else, and you&#39;ll have the beginnings of a<br/>\nhome-based business!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:Ready to start, but have a financial question","postDate":"1172690080","msgId":21762,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMyYi5lMzM5YmNmLjMzMTcyZWEwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":21746,"nextInTopic":21849,"prevInTime":21761,"nextInTime":21763,"topicId":21706,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~Does anyone work from home?

That said, <br/>\nI&#39;ve been doing it for almost 10 years and I am no super human.
