Your fear is emitted through your pores too!  Not just  your voice! <br/>\nThis is the deschooling ourselves that we talk about a lot. You&#39;re  going to <br/>\nhave to *believe* it&#39;s not evil! Really.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about this all morning. There&#39;s a conversation on the  <br/>\nmessage boards about tv too. There we&#39;ve been criticized for being anti-book,  <br/>\nwhen actually we&#39;re just pro-tv. We&#39;re NOT anti-book----in fact I&#39;d guess  ALL <br/>\nof us are avid readers! It&#39;s just that we don&#39;t denigrate tv as evil and  make <br/>\nbooks &quot;godly&quot;. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s been called &quot;book worship&quot;---when the value of books is raised to  <br/>\nincredible heights. Books are no more, and no LESS, valuable in our home than  <br/>\nanything else. A hundred years ago, a book *might* be the most valuable  <br/>\npossession a family owned. I doubt I could even guess the number we own  now---and many <br/>\nare in *anything* but pristine condition.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nThese days and times, we just have many more things that are just as  <br/>\nstimulating, as inspiring, and as thought-provoking as books. TV, movies, games,  <br/>\ncomputers---even our backyard! is often more stimulating than many  books.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, for young children:   I&#39;ve seen a lot of clammer that young  children <br/>\nshould not be exposed to tv or computers. I have a really hard time  with that. <br/>\nI read articles all the time about how bad they are. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nLet&#39;s say that everyone should have an apple a day----that was all the  rage <br/>\na few decades back. Apples are nutritious, crunchy, good for the teeth.  <br/>\nProblem is that the very young and the very old---and a few hockey  players---CAN&#39;T <br/>\neat apples. No teeth. Applesauce is ok, but NOT as good as  apples because it <br/>\nisn&#39;t crunchy, lots of vitamins are lost, you can&#39;t carry it  around, you <br/>\nneed a spoon, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nTV (and computers) is similar to applesauce, in that books are deemed  better <br/>\n(by somebody). But children, who can&#39;t read, can STILL be wowed by so  much <br/>\ninformation, movement, songs, stories, math, science, history,  geography, <br/>\nphilosophy, cooking, vocabulary....everything! from tv!<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nEven children who CAN read---as well as adults and old farts----can  absorb <br/>\nSOOO much cool information withOUT books. It&#39;s right there! Why does it  come <br/>\nacross as evil? It&#39;s just another way to gather information. And it&#39;s  <br/>\nESPECIALLY handy for pre-readers! They can pick up so many words and see places  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve never been, animals they&#39;ve never seen.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nHow is this evil? <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nHow is it even remotely bad?<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nAs we get older, as we see more tv, it becomes just another source of  <br/>\ninformation and entertainment. My bee hives are JUST as fascinating---to me! But  to <br/>\na child, tv is often HUGELY informational and entertaining. As it should  be.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nNevertheless, the facination often wanes as other things become more  <br/>\ninteresting. My 16 year old (who spent 18 MONTHS just watching tv, sleeping,  eating, <br/>\nand talking on the phone as he deschooled) now rarely watches anything  but <br/>\n&quot;Whose Line is it Anyway&quot; and maybe &quot;Family Guy&quot; (with his little  brother).<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nHe&#39;s just too busy with his other interests.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s hard, with all the brainwashing that&#39;s been done to us, to believe  that <br/>\ntv isn&#39;t evil. There have even been several books written about the  <br/>\n*dangers* of tv. But when you look at it as just another  information/entertainment <br/>\nsource, it BECOMES just another  information/entertainment source.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nBack off. Watch *with* them. Pick up knitting or macrame if the sitting  <br/>\nbothers you. TV&#39;s just another cool way to learn about our world. But you have  to <br/>\nbelieve that!<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nOr fake it &#39;til you make it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141910957,"authorName":"Valerie","from":"&quot;Valerie&quot; &lt;valerie@...&gt;","profile":"valfitz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: TV","postDate":"1086805448","msgId":485,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNhN2trOCtuOGJwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJDRUM2OEE3LjI3RkY4JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":484,"nextInTopic":487,"prevInTime":484,"nextInTime":486,"topicId":449,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I was raised without tv, convinced that it was this awful form of communication that rotted your brain. <br/>\nHMPHF!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mind has obviously been changed.:)<br/>\nA few years ago, when we went through the whole &quot;detox&quot; period, I thought my kids would never do anything else. It was mainly my oldest, who had the most controls in his life, that had problems walking away.<br/>\nIt took about a year...<br/>\nAnd you know what?<br/>\nHe&#39;s still a bright, creative, wonderful individual...tv did nothing to alter that. I figured a year of tv as a child, was better than as an adult! Now his life is full of many different topics of interest, tv holds no power over him, but he still enjoys it immensely.<br/>\nHe&#39;s probably learned more from tv, than any other form of communication.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best advice I got when dealing with my fears and frustrations, was to sit down and watch it with them! To get interested in the shows they like, talk about them, BE together. It showed my kids I was not the enemy where tv was concerned, and it opened up their world to me in a new way. It was another thing to connect over, not create conflict.<br/>\nThe other thing that I had to learn, was to make good options available more readily. If tv is the most interesting thing available in the house, then it just shows how intelligent the child is for choosing the most attractive option! So I tried to make sure we had some bubbly, fun things going on here and there, to make myself feel better. They gravitated back to the tv fairly quick though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that helped me, was to see the tv as a learning opportunity, not something I needed to get them away from.<br/>\nOnce I saw the whole wide world as potential learning tools, I no longer felt stressed when they needed a lot of television. It was just another way they were learning. And learn they did!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo....hang in there. Trust that your child is doing exactly what they need to for the time being. I can honestly say, 3.5 years later, that it was one of the best things I ever did. It has led to more joyful unschooling, better relationships and much learning. I have learned more than anyone probably, about letting go of my need to control and what a wonderful tool television really can be. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":173212844,"authorName":"Michelle","from":"Michelle &lt;mamatoethan1@...&gt;","profile":"mamatoethan1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] TV","postDate":"1086783417","msgId":462,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNjA5MTIxNjU3LjgzMzc4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjkwMTEwLm1haWwuc2NkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":460,"nextInTopic":464,"prevInTime":461,"nextInTime":463,"topicId":449,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry for the confusion.

So much so, that he does not want to leave it to eat.  He has missed meals to continue to watch.  This has been going on for about 2 months now.  But I have noticed in the last few days a change.  When he gets up in the morning now, he wants to play on the computer instead of going straight for the TV.  He played for an hour and a half this am.  I am active with a homeschool group, so we are out of the house 3-4 days a week.  I see that he is learning from what he watches, and trust that he is getting what he needs from it at this time in his life.  I am confident that this will pass, as he finds new things that interest him, and I try to make available things that I think he would like.

We have been &quot;homeschooling&quot; with charter schools and have now chosen to leave it behind and truly unschool.  After lurking on this list for a while, I&#39;m seeing how I have to (want to) change a lot about how I&#39;ve been interacting with my 2 sons (12 and 8), beyond the school/learning issue.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHaving just lifted the restrictions on food and TV (I was one of those people who thought television was the Source for All Evil, followed by sugar consumption), my sons are glued to TV for hours now.  Please tell me this is a phase and they&#39;ll grow bored with it!  Has that happened to others?  I&#39;m looking for support in this process of trusting my wonderful children, even as they go off the deep end with zoning out to TV.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.
