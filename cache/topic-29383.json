I&#39;ve researched this school. <br/>\nIt seems to have a good reputation and is accredited.  However, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t find anyone who has tried it and I don&#39;t know much about how an<br/>\nonline school works except that this one is inexpensive and you work<br/>\nat your own pace.  Such a school would be perfect for me and my wife<br/>\nbecause of work and home schooling duties.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who has some information, or wants to know more about this<br/>\nschool, please email me at backtocebu at yahoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29372,"nextTopicId":29339}}
