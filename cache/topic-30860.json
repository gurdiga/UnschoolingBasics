So he&#39;s doing something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond - you don&#39;t leave everything up to him - your job is to support  <br/>\nhim, help him, encourage him, offer him ideas and things and  <br/>\nexperiences and --- the world! But, start right now where he IS -  <br/>\nright now he loves to play video games. Support that with all your  <br/>\nheart - make it possible for him to really play as much as he wants.  <br/>\nTake him food while he&#39;s playing. Subscribe to video game magazines.  <br/>\nBuy him new games or upgrades as often as you can. Help find him other  <br/>\npeople who like to play the same games. Get him Skype so he can use  <br/>\nvoice-over-internet to talk to other players. Find related products -  <br/>\ncd&#39;s of video game music, movies based on video games, etc. Whether  <br/>\nyou fully feel it or not, ACT like him playing video games is the most  <br/>\nwonderful thing you can imagine him doing. Support support support.  <br/>\nSit near him in the same room when he&#39;s playing - let him TELL you all  <br/>\nabout it. Ask questions. Learn enough about it that you can have good  <br/>\nconversations. Oh, look up online comic strips (I don&#39;t know names -  <br/>\nmy kids show them to me) - they are hysterical, but you often have to  <br/>\nknow about video games to get the jokes. Look up information about the  <br/>\ncomposers of the video game music - what else have they done? You&#39;ll  <br/>\nbe surprised - maybe share just a bit of what you learn, with your  <br/>\nson, if he&#39;s interested. GO to conferences/conventions or other events  <br/>\nthat are video game related.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, really truly get INTO this and support it  <br/>\nwholeheartedly. THAT is what unschooling is about. At the same time,  <br/>\nthink about your son and what else he is interested in and offer other  <br/>\nkinds of input as well. Do you do interesting things as a family? Go  <br/>\nto the Renaissance Faire, camping, to concerts, museums, exhibits,  <br/>\ntheater, bowling, white water rafting, paint-ball playing, sky diving?  <br/>\nAnything? Live a joy-filled life - focus on that and the learning will  <br/>\nhappen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, if you want to read some very interesting, but highly academic,  <br/>\ndiscussion of video games, you might read a bit of this blog by a  <br/>\nuniversity professor: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://grandtextauto.org/\">http://grandtextauto.org/</a>&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son is a Christian but now in class he refused to read when his  <br/>\n&gt; teacher<br/>\n&gt; called on him to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please please honor his desire not to read out loud in public. That is  <br/>\nanxiety-provoking for many people and coercing it just makes it worse  <br/>\nand worse. Show him you respect him and trust his judgment. If he  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t feel comfortable doing it, support that. Tell his teacher that  <br/>\nyou prefer that she ask for volunteers and not put anybody on the spot  <br/>\nthat way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he&#39;s in Sunday School, don&#39;t you want it to be a warm and  <br/>\nwonderful experience for him? Shouldn&#39;t that time be really some of  <br/>\nthe most inspiring, life-affirming time of his week? It shouldn&#39;t be a  <br/>\ntime he dreads or is made to feel bad about himself, should it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rude of his teacher - that&#39;s what I think about that.<br/>\nI taught Sunday School for many years. One reason I taught it was to  <br/>\nbe sure that my own kids had really good experiences - especially my  <br/>\nyoungest daughter who was a later reader. Sunday school teachers  <br/>\nshould be demonstrating the utmost kindness and respect for the  <br/>\nchildren, not embarrassing them. They should be enticing them with the  <br/>\nsweetness of the lesson and providing a wonderful living example, not  <br/>\nshoving something down their throats, right?

My 14yo dd doesn&#39;t like to read either but I know <br/>\nshe is capable of it so I don&#39;t worry.  For her she doesn&#39;t like the <br/>\nsmell of books.  She likes to go to Barnes & Noble and sit in the <br/>\ncomfy chairs and read but doesn&#39;t like library books.  We have a <br/>\nsubscription to Audible.com and she gets two or three audiobooks a <br/>\nmonth.  She listens to them on her i-pod every night.  She&#39;s also on <br/>\nthe computer a lot.  As an avid reader this was very hard for me to <br/>\nunderstand but I got past it.  It is really about us being ok with <br/>\nthem learning in their own way.  I&#39;m still working on not needing to <br/>\nlook for the educational equivilant of everything she does and just <br/>\nenjoy our life together.  I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s a whole other topic <br/>\nthough. : )<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244317154,"authorName":"swissarmy_wife","from":"&quot;swissarmy_wife&quot; &lt;heatherbean@...&gt;","profile":"swissarmy_wife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: lurker but love the list","postDate":"1205500519","msgId":30861,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZyZHRwNytxMG80QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwZDEwMWM4ODVjMyQzZmQ1OWNlMCQ2NjAxYThjMEBEQ1dXRlRCMT4="},"prevInTopic":30860,"nextInTopic":30863,"prevInTime":30860,"nextInTime":30862,"topicId":30860,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... want to do ...

But he reads all the time. <br/>\nYesterday was the first time he ever picked up a book and read it from<br/>\ncover to cover by himself.  It&#39;s amazing what happens when you don&#39;t<br/>\nforce reading on a child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTry changing your perspective.  Instead of &quot;working with&quot; your 10 year<br/>\nold, can&#39;t you simply enjoy stories together?  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I thought of some kind of incentive program maybe I can put in place<br/>\n </span></blockquote>for my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 11 year old. <br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>IMO, incentive programs are a waste of time and children are smart<br/>\nenough to see through it.
