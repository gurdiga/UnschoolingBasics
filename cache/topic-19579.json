She has a lot of deschooling to do (they <br/>\nsay AT LEAST one month for every year in school - I included day care <br/>\nand K! and for many it takes much longer).  She&#39;s still trying to <br/>\nfigure it out. There&#39;s nothing wrong with doing schoolish <br/>\nassignments, IF it&#39;s her choice, but I can also understand your <br/>\nfrustration at it being thrown back in your face.  I pulled my dd (14 <br/>\nthis past Sep) out of school in Jun 2005 and she&#39;s just recently <br/>\nbegun to emerge.   Lots of healing was (and still is) needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And accuses me of being terrible for &quot;not making her do it&quot; b/c <br/>\n </span></blockquote>she&#39;ll end up stupid compared to everyone else.

Are you (intentionally or not) <br/>\nsending this message yourself at all?   Are you able to calmly (at a <br/>\ntime when conversation is more relaxed) discuss these concerns with <br/>\nher?  (and for the record, I&#39;ve found it hardest for ME to deschool, <br/>\nto not have traditionally schooly thoughts!).   Have you read The <br/>\nTeenage Liberation Handbook?   Anything by John Holt?  &quot;Parenting a <br/>\nFree Child&quot; by Rue Kream?  The book that really &quot;did it&quot; for me <br/>\nwas &quot;Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling&quot; <br/>\nBy John Taylor Gatto.

There&#39;s a lot in the <br/>\narchives here about trust (people who have written about it much <br/>\nbetter than I can, we still have a ways to go).   It&#39;s harder when <br/>\nkids have been in school than if they had unschooled from day one, <br/>\nthey have a lot of confused thoughts.  I know there are others on <br/>\nthis list, like I said, that can speak more clearly about this than I <br/>\ncan!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;One day she&#39;ll say unschooling is cool and fun, the next day she <br/>\n </span></blockquote>claims she is sooo bored and can&#39;t stand not having anything to do.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are her days like?  What does she like to do?   Can she do <br/>\nwhatever she wants, for as long as she wants?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd found World of Warcraft (online computer game, prior to that it <br/>\nwas Runescape, Neopets, Toontown) the spring before she left school <br/>\nafter 6th grade.   She became absorbed with the game and would play <br/>\nit for the greater portion of each day, unless we had something <br/>\nplanned.  She also watched TV, slept as much as she wanted, talked on <br/>\nthe phone with her only IRL friend (a girl in another town who is <br/>\nstill in school).
