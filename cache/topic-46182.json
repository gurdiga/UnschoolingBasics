You&#39;re asking about rights  <br/>\nabout an unconventional form of homeschooling without having read  <br/>\nenough to realize that states determine what&#39;s legal as far as  <br/>\neducation goes. It has the feel of a simple, straightforward answer  <br/>\nbeing dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents can *homeschool* in all 50 states. (I don&#39;t know if any states  <br/>\nspecifically grant parents the right to homeschool. A more common  <br/>\nphrasing recognizes parents&#39; right to see to their children&#39;s  <br/>\neducation, but some states define some parameters in the interests of  <br/>\nthe state.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Texas it&#39;s easy to homeschool. You just withdraw your child from  <br/>\nschool and that&#39;s it as far as the state is concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Unschooling* is possible in all 50 states but there is no legal  <br/>\nlanguage that specifically mentions unschooling. Again, it&#39;s easy it  <br/>\nTexas, but involves some hoop jumping in other states.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":401046479,"authorName":"lorain25","from":"&quot;lorain25&quot; &lt;lorain25@...&gt;","profile":"lorain25","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"What are my rights?","postDate":"1298098910","msgId":46182,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlqbnBzdSttMXNoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46184,"prevInTime":46181,"nextInTime":46183,"topicId":46182,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is unschooling legal in Houston?","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1915660657\">Is unschooling legal in Houston?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46178,"nextTopicId":46186}}
