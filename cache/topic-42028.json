I have ben working very hard at being child-focused and embracing my children&#39;s needs.  Although hard at times with 5 kids in a household, I am working on MY attitude and joyfulness.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is that my husband and I are conflicting very regularly.  His parents were very strict, parent-focused, and did not in any way, shape, or form, encourage noise or children making their own decisions.  Very fundamentalists in their religion and very much into the &quot;children are seen but not heard&quot;.  Although my dh is not that radical, his background shows up when he is around the house (which is a lot) and it cramps or style of enjoying each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am at a loss of what to do. We talk a lot about it and he wants to be different in theory, but when it comes to practicing it, he is not very successful.  Just now he told the kids to take their toys elsewhere because he had to study (not for work, for pleasure) and I suggested he move locations and he said he was there first.  Yes, he is quite selfish and he will admit that, but doesn&#39;t do much to change it.  He thinks yelling is an appropriate form of parenting and tells me I should &quot;make&quot; my kids listen to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am probably pretty resentful because I don&#39;t like the way his parents grandparent the children when they are around (luckily not often), so I think about that when he starts acting this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?
