My use of the<br/>\nterm is when I see a parent laying claim to the label of unschooler<br/>\nbut what I see them doing is unparenting.... let me give an example.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWe knew a family where there was a 12 yr old and a 4 yr old and the<br/>\nmother was claiming to be an unschooler... I challenged her claim<br/>\nbased on my observation that there were no books in her house, just a<br/>\nvery few toys(money was NOT an issue as far as resources) and she<br/>\ncomplained constantly of how demanding her 4 yr old was (Can you<br/>\nBELIEVE she wants ME to PLAY with her ALL DAY???)   <br/>\n<br/>\nShe also had arbitrary rules out the whazoo!   Bedtime was strictly<br/>\nenforced (to give mom a break... from what I asked?), they weren&#39;t<br/>\nallowed certain foods, weren&#39;t allowed to go here and there on the<br/>\ncomputer (she had all these crazy filters)  weren&#39;t allowed to have a<br/>\nMy Space or Facebook acct ...all email had to go through mom&#39;s account<br/>\nand on and on.  They were also required to do math every day because<br/>\nthe mother just thought that couldn&#39;t be left undone and kids just<br/>\nwon&#39;t choose to do that without being made.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMom was obsessed with having a spotless house but wanted to do very<br/>\nlittle of the actual cleaning ... my kids slept over and after all the<br/>\nkids were settling down for the night the child had to leave her<br/>\nfriends and go downstairs to clean up the &quot;mess you and your friends<br/>\nmade&quot; which entailed washing dishes, sweeping the floor, mopping the<br/>\nfloor, vacuuming carpets, taking out garbage etc ... the other kids<br/>\nfelt bad and pitched in to help..(bear in mind that prior to the<br/>\nsettling down phase of the night entire families were present at this<br/>\nparty invited by the parents.<br/>\n    <br/>\nThe mom also bragged about spending 10-12 hours a day in marathon<br/>\nvideo gaming sessions and admitted to wondering what the kids ate or<br/>\ndid during those times because she wasn&#39;t paying attention to them.  <br/>\nHer kids were sneaky about food and treats, miserable, angry and<br/>\nunkind to friends, constantly negative and so forth.    I will have to<br/>\nadmit it was my first experience with someone claiming to be an<br/>\nunschooler that in my opinion was unparenting.    This same mom put<br/>\nher kids back in school last year because the youngest was so annoying<br/>\nby wanting mom to constantly play games, read etc and the older child<br/>\nwas according to the dad &quot;was going to have to go to school if she was<br/>\nstill as dumb next year as she is now&quot; AHHHH!   They even had a family<br/>\njoke where the older child would point to the younger child and say<br/>\n&quot;rocket scientist&quot; and then to herself and say &quot;burger flipper&quot;.   The<br/>\nwhole situation was just heartbreaking for me to watch.     <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway it was my experience with just cringing when I would hear her<br/>\ntell other people she was an unschooler!   UGH!   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway to me unparenting is not being present with your children, not<br/>\nallowing them freedom, not trusting them or giving them your time,<br/>\nattention and unconditional love.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: hitting & unparenting","postDate":"1215617524","msgId":34437,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwNzA5MDgzMm0xYTdmMDJhNGoxOTUxMGUwZDA3OTJjYzY5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc1MHA1cStyanI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwNzA4MTMyNnQxMmNiZDMxYXEyN2ZlNDRkYzRhNGRhNThjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPGc1MHA1cStyanI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34436,"nextInTopic":34447,"prevInTime":34436,"nextInTime":34438,"topicId":12950,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Fogging is a term for something I do with people who seem unable to hear anything unless they re already saying it.

You don&#39;t say how old he is, but I <br/>\nwould let him know *very clearly* that hitting and otherwise <br/>\nphysically or verbally abusing people for ANY reason makes people go <br/>\naway, and unless he wants to be very lonely, he needs to figure out <br/>\nsome other better way to express himself and his wide range of <br/>\nfeelings.  I would not take it personally or make it personal.  I <br/>\nwould present these facts to him and not sugar-coat them.  Really, <br/>\nyou&#39;ll be helping him master an extremely off-putting mannerism that <br/>\nhe has adopted that is just not going to work out for him in the long <br/>\nrun or the short run.  Hitting isn&#39;t cool, and he needs to understand <br/>\nthis.  You can help by brainstorming with him other better ways of <br/>\nexpressing himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marji<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyparenting.com/\">http://joyfullyparenting.com/</a>&gt;JoyFully Parenting & Life Coaching<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gaiawolf.org/\">http://gaiawolf.org/</a>&gt;GaiaWolf ~ Music for the Planet<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://myspace.com/marjizintz\">http://myspace.com/marjizintz</a>&gt;Marji&#39;s Myspace Page<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":206695648,"authorName":"jamieminnis","from":"&quot;jamieminnis&quot; &lt;jamieminnis@...&gt;","profile":"jamieminnis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Hitting","postDate":"1213798559","msgId":33853,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGczYjVhditia28yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":12954,"nextInTopic":33854,"prevInTime":33852,"nextInTime":33854,"topicId":12950,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am at my wits end.
