What I find really <br/>\ninteresting (and satisfying in a way too) is that now, after multi-<br/>\nyears of me telling the waitress no sauce, just parmesan... etc DS <br/>\nis now specifying what he wants in restaurants. Guess he takes after <br/>\nme - if a restaurant -has- a food somewhere on the menu, and I want <br/>\nit, I just rearrange things and make my own meal combinations. In <br/>\nvery few circumstances have they said it could not be done (and if <br/>\nthey say No substitutions right on the menu, I just do something <br/>\nelse and likely skip that as an option for the future). One time I <br/>\neven taught the waitress how to make what I wanted to drink - they <br/>\nhad all the ingredients after all. I wanted a New York egg cream (no <br/>\neggs involved lol) at a Friendly&#39;s (low end sit down restaurant <br/>\nknown for its ice cream desserts). Anyhow, what it requires is <br/>\nmixing a little chocolate syrup and milk or cream into a thick <br/>\nchocolate milk (only about an inch of milk with a full serving of <br/>\nchocolate syrup) then filling the glass with ice and seltzer to <br/>\ncreate a carbonated chocolate milk basically. They had all the <br/>\ningredients so they did it and charged me something between a <br/>\nregular soda and a shake.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would never think of making him eat anything he didn&#39;t want.  <br/>\n&gt;But saying <br/>\n&gt; that he&#39;s also the kind of kid who will wake up late & not want to <br/>\n&gt;eat <br/>\n&gt; breakfast if everyone else is done. The only catch to this is he <br/>\n&gt;will get <br/>\n&gt; sick if he doesnt eat something. So I have to suggest he eats <br/>\n&gt;something ( <br/>\n&gt; even a handful of cheese cubes will do) before he goes off and <br/>\n&gt;plays with <br/>\n&gt; everyone.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Neither DH nor DS like to eat first thing. I called home yesterday <br/>\naround 11 to say hi and they were eating breakfast - they had been <br/>\nawake for 3 or 4 hours by then. One thing we have done in the past <br/>\n(and continue although don&#39;t need to as much) is discuss what we <br/>\nobserved when DS hadn&#39;t eaten and related how we feel when we don&#39;t <br/>\neat - DS knows I get grumpy and tense and even weak if I haven&#39;t <br/>\neaten - he&#39;s seen it. And he gets easily frustrated and irritable - <br/>\nhe&#39;s felt it. So we can remind him &quot;need some protein?&quot; or &quot;how <br/>\nabout (food item) before you go (do something)?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I too remember being punished if I didnt clean my plate. I <br/>\n&gt;remember sitting <br/>\n&gt; at the table until 11pm because I wouldn&#39;t eat cooked spinach (it <br/>\n&gt;just <br/>\n&gt; wouldnt go down). <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was lucky - we never had this at our house. If we didn&#39;t want what <br/>\nwas cooked, we could make ourselves a sandwich (there was always <br/>\nPBJ). And as we got older, we&#39;d often offer to cook up something <br/>\ndifferent for whoever wanted it.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I never make them finish their plates. I ask them if they are done <br/>\n&gt;& if they <br/>\n&gt; have stuff left I ask them if they want to save it for later.  We <br/>\n&gt;also keep <br/>\n&gt; in stock quicky foods for Coty (little mini burgers, mac & <br/>\n&gt;cheese,etc) so <br/>\n&gt; when we eat chili, he can have what he prefers to eat.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>DS&#39; favorite discovery this past year is that the microwave has <br/>\nsettings for omelettes and oatmeal so he can do them almost totally <br/>\nhimself! <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Its a good question ....... how does one FORCE another to eat?

It would probably look to <br/>\noutsiders like I am just having a discussion with him, but I am well <br/>\naware of what I am doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;he is surely eating processed foods as soon as your back is <br/>\nturned&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that was really never the issue, I have no problem with <br/>\nprocessed food per se.

The kids <br/>\nagreed on the restaurant and Zach ordered whatever he wanted.  In <br/>\nthe past, he would do so and then drink soda after soda, almost <br/>\ngulping them even though we have soda at home, then refuse to eat.  <br/>\nEven taking the food home, it would simply sit in the fridge while <br/>\nhe ate chips or gulped juice.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, he ate an enchilada and I asked him to try queso.  We live in <br/>\nSan Antonio for gosh sakes and the kid had never tried queso <br/>\n&lt;grin&gt;.  He gave me the &quot;hairy eyeball&quot; but acquiesed (sp?).  He ate <br/>\nthe entire bowl without me even mentioning it again and even asked <br/>\nhis sister for hers.

Our 6yr old is totally different. <br/>\nHe is extremely choosey in the foods he eats. We went to a family <br/>\nget-together and someone tried to get him to eat spagetti w/sauce, now<br/>\nCoty hasn&#39;t eaten anything with tomato based sauce since , well forever!! <br/>\nThis aunt was appauled that I would &quot;take the time&quot; and to make sure he got <br/>\nhis spagetti plain with a little cheese !!  I got the &quot;you&#39;re going to spoil <br/>\nhim, he&#39;s only 6 he shouldnt decide what to eat, your his parent - make him <br/>\neat it just like everyone else, etc.&quot;  I&#39;m betting she wouldn&#39;t have liked a <br/>\nlittle liver spread on her choco cake, which by the way she was eatting <br/>\nbefore her spagetti !!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never think of making him eat anything he didn&#39;t want.  But saying <br/>\nthat he&#39;s also the kind of kid who will wake up late & not want to eat <br/>\nbreakfast if everyone else is done. The only catch to this is he will get <br/>\nsick if he doesnt eat something. So I have to suggest he eats something ( <br/>\neven a handful of cheese cubes will do) before he goes off and plays with <br/>\neveryone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too remember being punished if I didnt clean my plate. I remember sitting <br/>\nat the table until 11pm because I wouldn&#39;t eat cooked spinach (it just <br/>\nwouldnt go down).  I soon became a leader of the &quot;clean your plate club&quot; and <br/>\nhave a backside to prove it. My kids say I&#39;m just squishy :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI never make them finish their plates. I ask them if they are done & if they <br/>\nhave stuff left I ask them if they want to save it for later.  We also keep <br/>\nin stock quicky foods for Coty (little mini burgers, mac & cheese,etc) so <br/>\nwhen we eat chili, he can have what he prefers to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts a good question ....... how does one FORCE another to eat? I can&#39;t <br/>\nimagine the tears that would flow if I somehow forced him to eat pizza with <br/>\nsauce.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a diabetic son & sometimes getting him to eat right is a challenge. <br/>\nIf he&#39;s having a day of I&#39;m not hungry, we make shakes, puddings, etc and do <br/>\nour best. I&#39;m really lucky with him though, he&#39;s a pretty good at eatting & <br/>\nunderstanding he needs to stay healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Ok, this whole food discussion has got me thinking now...<br/>\n&gt; HOW does one force a child to finish their meal?<br/>\n&gt; HOW does this work?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Forcing people to eat","postDate":"1131564947","msgId":7658,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrdGoyaitjMnUxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7654,"nextInTopic":7661,"prevInTime":7657,"nextInTime":7659,"topicId":7626,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For us, I would simply tell Zach that I really, truly wanted him to finish it.

I haven&#39;t read anything that said this.<br/>\nI DO think there&#39;s been so much focus on his eating, that he may be<br/>\ntrying to fight for some control. Who knows.<br/>\nIt&#39;s certainly not normal for people (even extremely thin ones) to<br/>\nturn white and shake over missing one meal.<br/>\n I also agree with you that this is an extreme case. I don&#39;t see how<br/>\non earth you can control a 12 y.o. diet though...he&#39;s surely eating<br/>\nprocessed foods as soon as your back is turned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s safe to say that there are extreme physical and emotional<br/>\nissues that make unschooling philosophies a challenge at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my child was on chemotherapy and refused to eat healthy, I would<br/>\nprobably be concocting some pretty nutritionally loaded shakes and<br/>\npushing the child to drink them. <br/>\nMost children aren&#39;t on chemotherapy thankfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course there are real life issues. I don&#39;t think we have to abandon<br/>\nour philosophies in those cases, I do believe we have to consider the<br/>\nmost respectful way to handle the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiterally EVERY parent that starts down this path after having<br/>\narbitrary limits tells us their child is different, it won&#39;t work for<br/>\ntheir child, they KNOW their child best.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve proven them wrong time and time again. So do we just quit giving<br/>\nadvice as soon as a parent says &quot;Oh, that won&#39;t work for MY child&quot;?<br/>\nNo, of course not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s up to individual people to decipher unschooling philosophies and<br/>\nhow to best apply it in their individual situations. Even knowing all<br/>\nthe extending issues that are affecting your child, I would favor less<br/>\ncontrol. That would still be my advice...obviously it&#39;s not my<br/>\nsituation or child so it has nothing to do with me in the end.;)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185316150,"authorName":"nrskay","from":"&quot;nrskay&quot; &lt;okmardesich@...&gt;","profile":"nrskay","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Forcing people to eat","postDate":"1131557895","msgId":7654,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrdGM2NytlNTZiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7649,"nextInTopic":7658,"prevInTime":7653,"nextInTime":7655,"topicId":7626,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ren; I m absolutely against forcing children to finish their plate, well not the plate, just the food on the plate.
