If you are allowing your <br/>\nchildren to do what they choose to do as regards schooling, then you <br/>\nare unschooling.  It doesn&#39;t matter if that means your children are <br/>\nworking through schoolbooks, choosing to take classes in a more <br/>\ntraditional school, or just &quot;playing&quot; all day.  I believe it &gt;IS&lt; <br/>\npossible (and likely very damaging) to take a different approach to <br/>\nhow much you trust each child to plan their activities (thereby <br/>\nunschooling one but forcing another to do lessons), but don&#39;t for a <br/>\nminute think that unschooling means you have to keep an interested <br/>\nchild AWAY from activities that look more like school to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that answer that question?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess my biggest fear with Unschooling(as I am sure it probably was with <br/>\n&gt; others at some point) is what if they are out in the real world, and they cannot <br/>\n&gt; even do something as simple as figure out how to pay for things at a store, <br/>\n&gt; or write a simple letter, or wotk at a job and be able to count money and give <br/>\n&gt; back change....or know the History of our Country....hmmm..actaully now that I <br/>\n&gt; am saying this out loud, I will assume that these skills will be learned <br/>\n&gt; since they would see it in our every day lives. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly!  The biggest advantage of unschooling, in my opinion, is <br/>\nthat it teaches children HOW to learn and leaves their DESIRE to <br/>\nlearn intact.  If somehow your child manages to get to adulthood <br/>\nmissing some important skill, they will at minimum have the knowledge <br/>\nof how to gain that skill for themselves when they need it.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":26943692,"authorName":"pscs@aol.com","from":"pscs@...","profile":"shepelec2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] I am new here and curious about unschooling","postDate":"1127304651","msgId":6705,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkyLjJmYTk2OGU3LjMwNjJhN2NiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6683,"nextInTopic":6720,"prevInTime":6704,"nextInTime":6706,"topicId":6683,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Renn, Yes, you are right.
