There&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t decide to either pull her or send her later. And hopefully after a full summer and with the knowledge that her sister will be home, she will want to be home, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if it&#39;s important to her to go back, and it&#39;s the three weeks of missed school that would have her repeating -- as opposed to her &quot;bad&quot; grades -- I would think the school would be obligated to allow her to do her class work at home. (When we were kids, they called it &quot;home bound&quot; education. Kids that had to be out of school for illness or injury for prolonged periods of time were allowed to complete their work at home, and the school even provided tutors -- essentially substitute teachers -- if the child needed it).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is their policy that is forcing her to miss the three weeks of school, not her inability to do the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nAngela Wolff<br/>\n(Joseph, almost 8; Hannah, 5; Miriam, 2 1/2)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://campwolff.blogspot.com/\">http://campwolff.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Nicole Willoughby &lt;cncnawilloughby@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My girls decided to go to school this year.
