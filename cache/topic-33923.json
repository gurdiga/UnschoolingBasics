And so are the  <br/>\npedestrians! When you are at a curb, waiting to cross, just go with  <br/>\nthe rest of the pedestrians, even if the lights haven&#39;t turned in your  <br/>\nfavour.  The good thing about this is that everyone, drivers and  <br/>\npedestrians, is paying attention. I&#39;ve heard, though, that the Surete  <br/>\n(police) are cracking down, so it may not be the &quot;take your life in  <br/>\nyour hands&quot; funfest it used to be!<br/>\n<br/>\n(FWIW, my dh says just skip Montreal and go to Quebec City, but he&#39;s  <br/>\nbiased towards fortifications and historical aspects &lt;g&gt;. He says  <br/>\nthere are lots of big cities like Montreal, but none in North America  <br/>\nlike Quebec City. He&#39;s probably right, but I don&#39;t know if you have  <br/>\nenough time, this trip, to do that. For me, I&#39;m still surprised that  <br/>\nafter living most of my young life in Ottawa, ON, I never made it to  <br/>\nQuebec City.
