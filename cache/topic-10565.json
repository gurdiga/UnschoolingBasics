We meet in neutral places (the local PS) b/c <br/>\nour 8yrolds take Tae Kwon Do there(not school related, just using the space).   Our 5&#39;s are in <br/>\nthe same preschool(very liberal) and so we see them there too.  I have stopped letting the <br/>\nkids go to their house w/o me, and have limited time with them.  In fact the last time we <br/>\nwere together my 5&#39;s and I left where they were to &quot;walk&quot; and they followed.

I, personally, do not believe that you are over reacting.  <br/>\nThe other mom seems to be a person that I would not like to be around.  <br/>\nIf you feel that these relationships need to continue than I believe you <br/>\nhave a need, and a right, to discuss your concerns with her.  I know you <br/>\nwill try to make it a nonconfrontational discussion but even if it has <br/>\nto be a confrontation, or becomes one, I think this woman needs to know <br/>\nthat her actions are inappropriate.  If she decides that she can not <br/>\nabide her children continuing a relationship with your children, that <br/>\nwould convince me that this is a family you are better off without.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I would deeply evaluate the relationships that the children <br/>\nhave and consider reducing the contact.  If your children really want to <br/>\nget together with them, then invite the children to come to your house <br/>\nor meet at a park or some other neutral ground.
