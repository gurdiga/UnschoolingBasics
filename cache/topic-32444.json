You can even give her that example if she is<br/>\ndemanding that your child be obedient (sorry if my example isn&#39;t very<br/>\nclear!)

What do I plan to tell everyone at<br/>\nthe reunion?  NOTHING.  I will be there for a week, in the same house,<br/>\nwith the kids sharing rooms.  I have no intention of making anything<br/>\nout of it.

If one of them gets a bit out of sorts (which is<br/>\ninterpreted by some family members as &quot;naughty&quot;) I&#39;ll give them comfort<br/>\nprivately and mention to the family that the &quot;change of schedule&quot; has the<br/>\nchild feeling a bit off.  This seems to allow them to believe that there&#39;s<br/>\nno reason for them to step in and correct our parenting.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMostly in this situation I see it as protecting my children from family who<br/>\nare all too willing to see all children as manipulative and bad.  If I show<br/>\nabsolutely no signs of being upset by my kids&#39; needs, no one else sees<br/>\nthings as being any different than what they expect.  And I always, in all<br/>\ncases, stand up for them if they&#39;re treated badly or I&#39;ll translate into<br/>\nrespectful language for family members who aren&#39;t being respectful (ie.<br/>\n&quot;your aunt was wondering if you&#39;d be willing to move your activity elsewhere<br/>\nbecause this spot is where everyone needs to walk through&quot; if a relative<br/>\nwere to say &quot;get your stuff out of the way!&quot; or something worse).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nConfidence, the ability to walk away from a challenge (&quot;sorry, that&#39;s not up<br/>\nfor discussion&quot; or &quot;thanks for the information, that&#39;s something to think<br/>\nabout&quot;), and the willingness to simply leave if the family becomes too<br/>\noppressive are pretty useful.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I wouldn&#39;t &quot;prepare&quot; anyone or try to make them &quot;understand&quot;<br/>\nbecause it just draws more attention and will make your parenting the focus<br/>\nof the gathering rather than just being with family.  Sure, if someone seems<br/>\nwilling to try to understand you can make brief explanations (or give them<br/>\nreferences to further information), but I&#39;ve found that is just as likely to<br/>\nbe thrown back in your face later.  If you don&#39;t need their approval, you<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to seek it.  And I&#39;ve found the less I try to help people<br/>\nunderstand, the more respectful they are of my choices and actions when it<br/>\ncomes to my kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLesley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: family trips","postDate":"1210173024","msgId":32468,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ2c2dwMCsyb2F0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ2czY0Zys3ZGF0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32465,"nextInTopic":32470,"prevInTime":32467,"nextInTime":32469,"topicId":32444,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Whenever we&#39;re going to a family situation, I spend a lot  <br/>\nof time talking with my kids about things that have happened in the  <br/>\npast, how it was handled (we also talk over those things as soon as  <br/>\nwe leave the situation), and then we talk about what could possibly  <br/>\nhappen and how we would like to handle it. I really tend to fall back  <br/>\ninto old parenting without a LOT of planning of how I&#39;d like to  <br/>\nhandle things, and it does help the kids prepare and give them time  <br/>\nto develop a firm and appropriate manner to defend themselves (as  <br/>\nawful as that sounds)  Also, while you are there, be sure to have  <br/>\ntime when you can just maybe go for a walk, or do something with just  <br/>\nYOUR kids, we usually have one-on-one time at my in-laws. Just take  <br/>\none kids for a couple of blocks, so you can say &quot;How&#39;s it going? Any  <br/>\nproblems?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest problem with reactions from others tends to be my own  <br/>\ndefensiveness. When you try to defend your parenting, it sends a cue  <br/>\nthat something is available to attack, that you are insecure about  <br/>\nthe choices you&#39;ve made. So I like Ren&#39;s suggestions, about just  <br/>\nBeing, but also, be bright and cheerful as you can about things, and  <br/>\ndon&#39;t ever mutter a complaint about how hard it is (I made that  <br/>\nmistake one time, right after we started homeschooling, four years  <br/>\nlater my mother STILL uses it as ammo when things look tough)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can, work it into conversations one-on-one with your family  <br/>\nbefore going, like talking to your mother and saying &quot;You know, I&#39;m  <br/>\nthinking because we don&#39;t see you often, the kids will not have a  <br/>\nbedtime while we&#39;re there. I&#39;ll just help them to bed when they&#39;re  <br/>\ntired.&quot; I dunno, just seems to make sense, instead of one big thing  <br/>\nthat they are thinking through, just little nuggets. If your sister  <br/>\nsays something about obedience when you&#39;re talking over the phone,  <br/>\nsay something like &quot;I know it feels good when they jump right to it,  <br/>\nbut isn&#39;t it nice to see a generous heart with something done  <br/>\nwillingly?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere will you be staying? Because with so many kids, surely you  <br/>\nwould qualify for a room by yourself! I know when we travel, with  <br/>\nnine of us we have to get two rooms (by law, due to numbers)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we&#39;ve never really done a family trip. A day trip to Tulsa  <br/>\nwith my parents was enough for me, and then two days with my in-laws  <br/>\nin Texas, but we had our own bedroom at dh&#39;s grandma&#39;s house so the  <br/>\nkids could escape in there. Good luck, I wish you the best on this.  <br/>\nFamily is nice, but they aren&#39;t the end all, be all, especially when  <br/>\nthe relationships are damaging.<br/>\n(hugs)<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Joshua, Breanna, Emily, Rachel, Samuel, Daniel and Avari<br/>\nWife to Zane<br/>\n<br/>\nblog me at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://startlinglives.blogspot.com/\">http://startlinglives.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://startlinglives365.blogspot.com\">http://startlinglives365.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On May 6, 2008, at 7:19 PM, Maisha Khalfani wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello in cyberland!

This trip is for my b-i-l and my mother’s birthday <br/>\n(they<br/>\nshare the same birthday) so I’m not really planning for it, nor am I <br/>\npaying<br/>\nfor anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n--=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nJust remember that they don&#39;t have any power over you---not even <br/>\nbecause they are picking up the tab. It was their choice and their <br/>\n*gift* to you to pay your way. You don&#39;t owe others for gifts. You can <br/>\nbe appreciative of their gift, but you don&#39;t have to plat their games <br/>\nin repayment.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour parents *had* their chance to be parents---and they could be <br/>\nwhatever kind of parents they CHOSE to be. It was a choice. THEIR <br/>\nchoice. Either they think they did an excellent job with you, so they <br/>\nshould be at peace with your decisions. OR---they did a lousy job with <br/>\nyou; and if so, they need to back off while you try better/different <br/>\ntechniques for a better outcome with *your* children. Either way, *you* <br/>\nare in charge.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you can ask them: did you feel you did a good job (so trust me) or <br/>\na bad job (so let me figure out a better way)? They will *want* to say <br/>\nthey did a GOOD job! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your sister, she has ABSOLUTELY NO SAY IN ANYTHING.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my parents it would help them to  have information beforehand.  <br/>\nThey may<br/>\nnot agree with it, but it’s better for them to know what’s going on.  My<br/>\nfamily tends to be “intellectual” and they like having “information” and<br/>\nsuch.  The more “expert” it seems the better :(<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, if they are TRULY intellectuals, they will be open to learn more <br/>\nabout something that&#39;s new to them, right? *YOU* have been on both <br/>\nsides of the fence. *YOU* know the results of their parenting, both as <br/>\na child AND as an adult parent. But they have never witnessed &quot;the <br/>\nother side.&quot; If they are *true* life learners, this shouldn&#39;t be a <br/>\nstretch. If they refuse to learn anything about it, they aren&#39;t really <br/>\nlife learners at all, are they? &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI will definitely talk to my children beforehand and let them know that <br/>\nif<br/>\nthere is any issue they can come to me first.  I don’t want them to feel<br/>\nlike they “have to” do anything just because it’s “family”.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah---let them know that *y&#39;all* are partners. And that, if someone <br/>\ncommands them, they can wait until they talk with you. Not to defiantly <br/>\nsay, &quot;I don&#39;t have to!&quot; but to quietly say, &quot;I&#39;d like to talk with my <br/>\nmom about that first.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they know you&#39;re trying to change and be a better parent, they will <br/>\nwork with you. You can all work together.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys and I discuss other parents all the time. It helps me to hear <br/>\nwhat they like about my parenting and helps me avoid what they don&#39;t <br/>\nlike in others. We talk about why a parent acts a certain way (few <br/>\ntools, bad modeling, power issues, etc.). They are KEEN observers of <br/>\nparenting and family relationships. I KNOW they will be better parents <br/>\nthan I am. They already have a lot of better life skills than I had at <br/>\ntheir ages! &lt;g&gt; And I think that has a lot to do with asking them to be <br/>\nmy partners in being a better, more mindful parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet *them* help *you* in this. Be sociologists during the trip. Notice <br/>\n(and remark/discuss when alone) how others act towards each <br/>\nother---parents, children, siblings, etc. Be observers and compare the <br/>\ndifferent behaviors, reactions, and power struggles. Decide what you, <br/>\nas a family would like to emulate and what you would like to stomp into <br/>\nthe ground.

If they are<br/>\ndiving into their own food stash, rather than the community food<br/>\nstash, then the likely hood of family members stopping them or saying<br/>\nanything goes down significantly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for sleeping, I have found that fun days in the sun put my kids to<br/>\nsleep much earlier than normal anyway.  You could discuss sleeping<br/>\narrangements with them ahead of time, I forget how old your children<br/>\nare.  Being respectful of other sleepers IS important.  I don&#39;t know<br/>\nyour accommodations, but trying to find the kids a &quot;cozy spot&quot; or<br/>\nplace of their own is a good idea.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for comments, I always had a way of ignoring them.

I don&#39;t know your family.  But<br/>\nthe truth is, every parent parents differently.  There&#39;s a million and<br/>\none categories you could group parenting styles into.  Personally, I<br/>\nwould just let this be your style, without worrying too much about<br/>\nlabeling it as unschooling and trying to explain it.

G&#39;ma and G&#39;pa as well as aunts/uncles and cousins of various<br/>\nages. We are pretty straight forward about what we do and why. We<br/>\nagree to disagree on some topics but I try to find common grround. My<br/>\nSIL just gave me some great advice pertaining to our mutual MIL. She<br/>\nasks MIL for inut and parenting advice on small inconsquential things<br/>\nbut never the big stuff she feels strongly about. This gives grammy<br/>\nsome say or at least consideration. I am going to try this because MIL<br/>\nis the one I conflict with. She did not ever allow my husband sugar<br/>\nuntil he was old enough to get it out of the house. And dh wasn&#39;t<br/>\nallowed to watch most TV programs and their were veiwing restrcitions<br/>\nas well. SO needless to say we differ! I am unapologetic when it comes<br/>\nto what we do. I don&#39;t apologize to my relatives if the wasy we parent<br/>\nmakes them uncomfortable if what we or our children is doing is<br/>\nreasonable. For instance, my kids hardly ever wear shoes by my sister<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t allow hers to be barefooted. This caused a problem for her at<br/>\nthe playground because she opted for struggle with her 2 y/o. I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t make my 5 y/o put on shoes even though it would have made her<br/>\nlife eaiser. My kids brought their DS&#39;s and portable video player and<br/>\nthis made grammy uncomfortable but I didn&#39;t change our families<br/>\nfreedom to make her comfortable. We have not really had much issue<br/>\neven though MIL is a school teacher and thinks we are nuts. She loves<br/>\nour kids and thinks they are awesome. I figure I am my kids parent and<br/>\nit is my &quot;job&quot; to be what they need me to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nabout the obidience with your sister. I would explain that we do<br/>\nthings differently. In our family we make request and don&#39;t demand<br/>\nobiedience. That is she has issues with your children that you are<br/>\nwilling to help her talk to them in a respectful way that they are use<br/>\nto. I make every effort to be cheerful and helpful (even when I don&#39;t<br/>\nfeel like it sometimes) around relatives that I have<br/>\nissues with. Not in a dishonest but in helping to keep the peace for a<br/>\nshort period of time.

My in-laws dont know were unschooling, nor<br/>\nanyone else on that side of the family, but they do know that Im a relaxed<br/>\ntype of parent so I doubt the reaction would be much more than Huh, that<br/>\nseems like something she would be doing. And then nothing would be said,<br/>\nperhaps a few curious questions but nothing judgemental.  However if you<br/>\nfeel that the reactions would take over the vacation, then giving them a<br/>\nheads up might be best.  Especially if you are sharing overnight spaces and<br/>\nthey will be expecting children to be in bed by a certain hour.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIm glad to hear that your Dh is more onboard with unschooling now, hooray!<br/>\nI know he was having a tough time understanding your point of view so thats<br/>\na huge step forward for your family. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShell & Da Boys<br/>\n<br/>\nDrew, 8.5 and Josh, 4.5<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.thedaker.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you are lucky enough to find a way of life you <br/>\nlove, you have to find the courage to live it.&quot; John Irving<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n[mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Maisha Khalfani<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 06, 2008 5:19 PM<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] family trips<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHello in cyberland!

This will be the first time that we will all<br/>\nbe sharing days and days together (Thursday  Sunday including driving to<br/>\nour destination together). <br/>\n<br/>\nAny helpful tips on how to deal with their reactions when my children are<br/>\nallowed to eat what they want, sleep when they want, etc? My sister, in<br/>\nparticular, is big on obedience and being told once to do something. <br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly part of me does not want to go on this trip, But it is an<br/>\nopportunity to spend time with family, and for the most part it can be a fun<br/>\ntrip.
