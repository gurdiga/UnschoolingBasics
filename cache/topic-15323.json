I&#39;ve struggled on and off with <br/>\nhaving more sit down meals together, but I think that part of the <br/>\nreason for that tradition is that families are often apart all day <br/>\nand the family dinner is catch up time (&quot;how was your day?&quot;  &quot;what <br/>\ndid you learn in school?&quot;)<br/>\nI&#39;ve been WITH my kids all day and so having that focused, <br/>\ndesignated quality time isn&#39;t so much an issue.   Realizing that <br/>\ntook some of the pressure off.   IME the best &quot;quality time&quot; springs <br/>\nup in unprogrammed times and places.   For us it&#39;s often either very <br/>\nlate at night or in the car. :-)  I also believe that good manners <br/>\ncome primarily from modelling, not from rules and requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember mandatory sit down meals during my childhood, and what I <br/>\nwas thinking during them was &quot;how long until I can get up and go <br/>\nback to my book/watch tv/call my friend?&quot;  I dreaded those meals.  <br/>\n(There&#39;s actually a very funny SNL skit concerning mandatory family <br/>\nmeals that I totally relate to. :-))<br/>\nPart of it was family tensions and difficulties, but I&#39;m certain a <br/>\nbig part of it was the mandatory nature of it- it felt like a <br/>\ndreaded chore.  I&#39;d rather my children sit and eat with me (and they <br/>\ndo, a lot- not necessarily dinner but little meals or snacks here <br/>\nand there) because they enjoy my company than because six o&#39;clock is <br/>\nshut off the tv, turn off the phone, quit whatever you&#39;re doing <br/>\nDinner Time.   That said, I can say that the times when they will <br/>\nchoose to sit with you come not only with the kind of relationship <br/>\nwhere they *want* to sit with you but with age and maturity.  Most <br/>\nvery young children I know have NO desire to sit motionless in a <br/>\nchair- they are all about movement, and for good reason.  Their DNA <br/>\nis telling them to MOVE!!! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also,the 3 yr old is soooooo busy, always having to have a <br/>\n&gt; truck or something to play with, that there are times he literally <br/>\n&gt; refuses to feed himself and asks me to do it, (particularly with <br/>\n </span></blockquote>any <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; food that can drop off a spoon like porridge but I try to give him <br/>\n&gt; mostly finger foods but even those lately he wants me to feed him) <br/>\n </span></blockquote>so <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; there are days the way he gets the majority of his intake is me <br/>\n&gt; feeding him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is reminding me of memories I haven&#39;t thought of in a long <br/>\nwhile.

I never did the Meal Time <br/>\nthing with them like so many moms I see where they strap the kid <br/>\ndown into some sort of contraption (or coerce him to sit there) and <br/>\nmake it into a whole required focused activity.  My toddlers, if <br/>\nthey were awake, were pretty much constantly on the move, exploring <br/>\nand playing.  When I guessed they were hungry I&#39;d hold a piece of <br/>\nsomething- banana, peanut butter sandwich, whatever- within their <br/>\nsight/smell and they&#39;d lean over and take it into their mouths while <br/>\nhardly missing a beat in their playing.

If he wants it on the counter he tends to come back to his food a short time later. If he wants it in the fridge we got him his own storage containers that he put stickers on, and we put it in the fridge till he&#39;s ready.

Normal when no one is forcing<br/>\nthem to stay at the table, anyway.&lt;g&gt;   Maybe it would help you to think<br/>\nabout why you like to have a mealtime.   You probably like one because<br/>\nthe convenience of making one meal to feed everyone at the same time<br/>\nappeals to you.   But since your kids were born you&#39;ve been making<br/>\nspecial meals for them (nursing or bottle) so it&#39;s not really like<br/>\n&quot;mealtime&quot; is a solidly established tradition for your kids.   It may<br/>\nbecome a nice family tradition, if that&#39;s what you hope for, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink it would if your kids were forced to stay at the table.   I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink they&#39;d feel good about that or want to be there.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnother reason you might like mealtimes is so the family can be together<br/>\nin one place and enjoy each other.   But how much enjoyment would there<br/>\nbe if you were pressing your kids to stay at the table and they were<br/>\nresisting?   I think you&#39;d find that stressful and they would too and I<br/>\nthink the meal and being together wouldn&#39;t be much fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n***or just plain old leave after about a<br/>\n1/4 of the meal and be hungry an hour later.***<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe there are certain foods you could leave out on the table for them<br/>\nto come back to.  Maybe they haven&#39;t really left when you think they have<br/>\nand they intend to come back but the food has been taken away by then.  <br/>\nYou could clear away your dishes and the foods you know your kids aren&#39;t<br/>\nmuch interested in and you could leave the rest of the food longer in<br/>\ncase they return.  <br/>\n <br/>\n***MIL imply that if I would<br/>\nhave had the expectation in the first place all along that they STAY<br/>\nat the table right from the beginning then we would not have these<br/>\nissues now. ***<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t see these as &quot;issues&quot; but as really normal kid behaviors and it<br/>\ncomes back to what kind of atmosphere you want at your table.   Your<br/>\nreality is this:  Your kids are little and don&#39;t have a the feelings<br/>\nabout mealtime that you have.  You can try to nurture a warm feeling<br/>\nabout mealtime but you won&#39;t do that by making your kids sit down and<br/>\nstay there.   Most of what happens at mealtime isn&#39;t fun for kids. <br/>\nMostly they&#39;re supposed to sit and eat and adults talk about stuff that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean anything to kids.  How long would *you* stay at a party if<br/>\nyou weren&#39;t supposed to move and the conversation was dead boring? &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nYou will only establish joy at mealtime by making mealtime a happy time<br/>\nfor your kids.   And, the purpose of food is to nourish.  Nourishment<br/>\ncomes in all kinds of ways, at a sit down meal or on the go and it can be<br/>\nmade unpleasant or it can be warm and loving.  You get to choose which it<br/>\nwill be for your kids.    Food forced on a kid at a sit down meal, when<br/>\nthe kid doesn&#39;t want to be there is not better or more nourishing than<br/>\nfood eaten on the go by a happy kid.   I&#39;ll bet the happy kid scenario is<br/>\na healthier scenario too, since stress causes all kinds of problems<br/>\nincluding indigestion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry your MIL is adding pressure to a situation you&#39;re already<br/>\nunsure of.   Think about what your goals are.   If your goals are happy<br/>\nkids and stress free nourishment of those kids then you can let go of<br/>\nyour MIL&#39;s expectation of what *your* family&#39;s meal time should look<br/>\nlike.   You can say, &quot;They&#39;re happy and they&#39;re eating and that&#39;s what&#39;s<br/>\nimportant,&quot; and then ignore her. &lt;g&gt; (or beat her to death with a<br/>\nzucchini.) <br/>\n<br/>\n***Also,the 3 yr old is soooooo busy, always having to have a<br/>\ntruck or something to play with, that there are times he literally<br/>\nrefuses to feed himself and asks me to do it, (particularly with any<br/>\nfood that can drop off a spoon like porridge but I try to give him<br/>\nmostly finger foods but even those lately he wants me to feed him) so<br/>\nthere are days the way he gets the majority of his intake is me<br/>\nfeeding him.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is sweet.   Dylan and I used to play a game.  I&#39;d hold onto<br/>\nthe food and he&#39;d be playing and then I&#39;d say &quot;baby bird, come to mamma<br/>\nbird...&quot;  and he&#39;d come over, flapping and chirping like a little bird,<br/>\nhis mouth open, and I&#39;d poke something into him.  &lt;g&gt;    Then he&#39;d go off<br/>\nto play some more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour little guy is enjoying being your baby.  Isn&#39;t that wonderful!?   He<br/>\nwon&#39;t be little forever.  He won&#39;t be a ten year old who wants you to<br/>\nfeed him,  I promise.&lt;g&gt;  Enjoy him and your time as mamma bird.    <br/>\n<br/>\n***The 6 yr old is pretty good at other people&#39;s houses as she<br/>\nunderstands that other people have different &quot;rules&quot; but the kids<br/>\nboth struggle and I grit my teeth with that stupid what-will-others-<br/>\nthink voice in my head or find myself not letting them eat before<br/>\ngoing over to another&#39;s house so they will be hungry enough to stay<br/>\nat the table for a while. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis probably doesn&#39;t bug your friends like you think it does.  If your<br/>\nfriends have kids then they know what kids are like.   But if it&#39;s really<br/>\na problem for you right now then instead of going over to your friend&#39;s<br/>\nhouse, have them come to yours.   No one is going to insist your kids sit<br/>\nat the table in your house. ; )    And offer your support to your kids<br/>\nwhen they get up and leave the table.  You can say &quot;Are you going to go<br/>\nplay for awhile?  I&#39;ll guard your food while your gone!&quot;   Your friends<br/>\nwill be much less likely to be disapproving if they know you approve. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know it&#39;s hard.  Your kids are very little.  Try to think about what is<br/>\nreally important.  Is it most important to you to meet the expectations<br/>\nof your friends and MIL or is it most important to have a joyful<br/>\nrelationship with your kids?   I think we all know the answer. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n***they are both very impulsive and very<br/>\neasily distracted compared to other kids I know, especially my girl.***<br/>\n<br/>\nImpulsive and distracted are pretty negative words in our society.  <br/>\nMaybe your daughter is energetic and curious!   The way we see our kids<br/>\naffects the way our children think about themselves.   Give her and<br/>\nyourself more positive words and ideas.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***I am sure she would be labled ADD/ with certain highly sensitive<br/>\naspects ***<br/>\n<br/>\nForget about that.  It absolutely doesn&#39;t matter.  Your daughter is who<br/>\nshe is and needs exactly what she needs just like everyone else on the<br/>\nplanet.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***She has been<br/>\nstarting to go into the fridge to get herself a yoghurt or something<br/>\nif she is hungry and I let her but then she won&#39;t eat at supper and<br/>\nthen her whole day has been eating 99% dairy products or fruit and<br/>\nnothing else or something despite having other things readily<br/>\navailable...***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s normal for kids to eat certain kinds of foods for a period of time. <br/>\nThey move on.  It will not hurt her to eat what she&#39;s enjoying right now.<br/>\n  <br/>\nAs long as she has other food choices available to her you can trust<br/>\nshe&#39;s getting what she needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***or I will give her a few pieces of candy before supper if<br/>\nshe asks thinking she has every right to just like I would and<br/>\nstruggle in my own mind when I see her eat 2 bites the rest of the<br/>\nevening because she is not hungry now.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really ok for people to eat when they&#39;re hungry and skip a meal if<br/>\nthey&#39;re not.   Food is for eating.  Candy is food.  If your daughter ate<br/>\ncandy and skipped meals enough that it made her feel unwell she would<br/>\ncome to understand the connection between a wider variety of foods and a<br/>\nfeeling of wellness. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou said she has food available at all times, all kinds of things she can<br/>\nchoose from.   So you know if she chooses candy it&#39;s because she really<br/>\nwants candy.   You can relax knowing she will get what she needs, even if<br/>\nshe skips a meal and has candy instead.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***there is my mom in my head with the thoughts of I<br/>\nworked hard to make this meal, so you eat it! ***<br/>\n<br/>\nThat mom voice gets quieter and disappears entirely when you make your<br/>\nfirst thoughts consideration for what your kids want and need to be happy<br/>\nan not a worry over what others will think of you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAside from it being your responsibility to provide food for your kids, <br/>\nIt can also a loving gift you give them.  Not the food itself but the<br/>\nwillingness to nourish them - in all ways -with food and with your love<br/>\nand your understanding and delight in their ways of being right now and<br/>\nalways.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I am<br/>\ntrying to relax more in this area but obviously have a lot to let go<br/>\nof and have not relaxed as much as I thought! ***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard!   You have years and years of a certain kind of programming<br/>\nand you&#39;re trying to rewire your brain all at once.  You *can* do it. <br/>\nIt&#39;s the best thing for your kids and for you.

But because they don&#39;t sit still in a<br/>\nclassroom, finish an assignment, and are constantly flitting from one<br/>\nactivity to another they are called &quot;ADD.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has been<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; starting to go into the fridge to get herself a yoghurt or something<br/>\n&gt; if she is hungry and I let her but then she won&#39;t eat at supper and<br/>\n&gt; then her whole day has been eating 99% dairy products or fruit and<br/>\n&gt; nothing else or something despite having other things readily<br/>\n&gt; available...or I will give her a few pieces of candy before supper if<br/>\n&gt; she asks thinking she has every right to just like I would and<br/>\n&gt; struggle in my own mind when I see her eat 2 bites the rest of the<br/>\n&gt; evening because she is not hungry now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ren said this to me once and I remind myself of it often.  Eating IS<br/>\nruining your appetite.  If 2 little pieces of candy filled her up,<br/>\nconsider what would have happened had she eaten a full meal.  And if<br/>\nshe is eating dairy and fruit, it sounds like she is getting a good<br/>\nsource of the majority of her nutritional needs in ways other than<br/>\nwhat the American diet deems &quot;suitable.&quot;  I know many vegetarians who<br/>\nlive off dairy and fruit (and tea LOL!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But when they just eat a<br/>\n&gt; few nibbles off this CONSTANTLY during the day, and not anything else<br/>\n&gt; it bothers me, as there is my mom in my head with the thoughts of I<br/>\n&gt; worked hard to make this meal, so you eat it!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually eating small nibbles through the day is much healthier than<br/>\neating 3 large meals a day.  It&#39;s easier on your blood sugar levels<br/>\nand keeps your energy levels most constant than having a constant<br/>\nroller coaster of energy.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2346607,"authorName":"ohpurple1@aol.com","from":"ohpurple1@...","profile":"openmindedfamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] strategies regarding food....(long)","postDate":"1152102749","msgId":15341,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMwNi43NmI0Yjg3LjMxZGQwYjVkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15339,"nextInTopic":15344,"prevInTime":15340,"nextInTime":15342,"topicId":15323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/4/2006 2:00:05 PM Eastern Standard Time, autismhelp@cox.net writes: Some days she hardly seems to eat anything at all, which is hard, ...

Once they realize it&#39;s not a power  <br/>\nstruggle, the sweets lose some of their appeal. Once it loses it&#39;s  <br/>\nappeal from power, they really choose it when they want it, not just  <br/>\nbecause they are scared it will disappear. It&#39;s hard to trust, but  <br/>\nyou really must, there is no long term danger from letting go! I will  <br/>\npoint out a short term one. My oldest one, who faced the most  <br/>\nrestrictions, when he was five at halloween, was allowed to eat as  <br/>\nmuch candy as he wanted, as well as stay up late for the first time.  <br/>\nHe became so ill, ugh, he threw up chocolate and caramel several  <br/>\ntimes over, he had gorged himself, not even chewing because he was so  <br/>\nworried we&#39;d change our minds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen this change over the years with my kids...I was very  <br/>\nstrict with my first two, and then as they wore me down (Okay, joking  <br/>\nhere...as I realized it wasn&#39;t as important as I thought it  <br/>\nwas..which was way before I started unschooling) I realized that my  <br/>\nyounger didn&#39;t hoard and crave the sweets like the older ones. The  <br/>\nyounger will buy a bunch of candy, but then it&#39;ll sit for weeks in  <br/>\nthe closet. Just today Emily and I were looking for her red skirt,  <br/>\nand while going through all the piles of clothes I would find candy  <br/>\nstraws &quot;Oh...I forgot about those!&quot; and then reece&#39;s cups &quot;That&#39;s  <br/>\nwhere they were!&quot;, and the gum &quot;I was saving that for another time&quot;,  <br/>\nand the skittles &quot;I know Elizabeth likes those, so I was saving them  <br/>\nfor her&quot;. It&#39;s funny. Josh never forgets a piece of candy, he knows  <br/>\nwhere EVERY snack food is stored, how much is in there, and he tracks  <br/>\nhow much each person gets and decides if it&#39;s fair or not. He&#39;s  <br/>\nobviously still deschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a divided dish from tupperware that is out on our counter  <br/>\nevery day. It has six types of snacks in it. I keep it loaded  <br/>\nthroughout the day, and more times than not, they will come up and  <br/>\nrequest that carrot sticks be filled out, or the ranch, or the  <br/>\nraisons or cheesecubes. THe first few weeks it WAS the chocolate  <br/>\nchips, or the skittles that disappeared over and over, but it has  <br/>\nchanged.<br/>\nI feel crummy saying all this, tonight I did have to tell Josh no on  <br/>\nsome cupcakes. Only because there were only 12 to begin with at my  <br/>\naunt&#39;s party, and he ate two of them, without thinking about the  <br/>\ntwenty OTHER people who might want one. So he was a little angry with  <br/>\nme...was not seeing my reasoning, even when I pointed out the other  <br/>\nsnacks, one of those great american cookie cakes with two inches of  <br/>\nicing on top (seriously, one piece made me ill, of course, it might  <br/>\nhave been the beer I drank right before burp!) and a chocolate fudge  <br/>\ncake thing.

Try to stifle the voices that tell you that a meal <br/>\nmust be hot, and eaten at a table with a fork. Listen to yourself, not <br/>\nanybody else. YOU are the best expert on your kids. Are they happy? <br/>\nHealthy? Bright eyed and full of energy?

He <br/>\ndescribes himself as a father of 5 and a pediatrician in his spare <br/>\ntime, lol. He wrote a book about toddler nutrition that is very <br/>\ncomforting for those of us who have kids who seem to subsist on air <br/>\nalone sometimes. It&#39;s normal. It&#39;s healthy. They are small, their <br/>\ntummies only hold so much. Sometimes they are growing, sometimes they <br/>\nare in a holding pattern before the next growth spurt. The worst thing <br/>\nyou can do is make it a huge power struggle with you trying to get them <br/>\nto eat, and them resisting.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re on the right track!

I am trying to relax more <br/>\nin the area of food.  I grew up in a contolling clean your plate and <br/>\nstay at the table kind of household.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, I have been able to relax in regards that the kids don&#39;t have <br/>\nto finish everything on their plates, and they best know if they are <br/>\nhungry or not. (at least I think I have but..) We do have &quot;mealtimes&quot; <br/>\n(for the adults sake) and fairly regular times a snack is offered but <br/>\nthey are free to take it or leave it, although they do tend to come <br/>\nto the table with us when we eat. I am struggling with some things <br/>\nthough....like getting up and leaving the table and coming back for <br/>\nmore bites over and over again, or just plain old leave after about a <br/>\n1/4 of the meal and be hungry an hour later.  The 3 yr old I can <br/>\nunderstand...he was like this as a younger toddler, and so was the 6 <br/>\nyr old, but even she still does this alot of the time and it is <br/>\nagitating me, especially when people like MIL imply that if I would <br/>\nhave had the expectation in the first place all along that they STAY <br/>\nat the table right from the beginning then we would not have these <br/>\nissues now.  I see how their little cousins stay at the table but I <br/>\nthink it is because of coercion and threats so that is not acceptable <br/>\nto me. Also,the 3 yr old is soooooo busy, always having to have a <br/>\ntruck or something to play with, that there are times he literally <br/>\nrefuses to feed himself and asks me to do it, (particularly with any <br/>\nfood that can drop off a spoon like porridge but I try to give him <br/>\nmostly finger foods but even those lately he wants me to feed him) so <br/>\nthere are days the way he gets the majority of his intake is me <br/>\nfeeding him.  I do leave a plate on his little craft table and that <br/>\nat times helps. Anyone else go through this?  Part of me wants to <br/>\njust follow his lead and trust he is doing this for a reason and part <br/>\nof me thinks it is silly of me to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have days it is ok and days it bugs the heck out of me, mostly <br/>\nbecause of those silly voices in my head and trying to find balance <br/>\nbetween needing to provide food for them as they can&#39;t do alot <br/>\nthemselves and knowing more about nutrition than they vs letting them <br/>\nhave some autonomy and the right to satisfying their own hunger. I am <br/>\nveeerrrrry slowly coming to terms with well maybe they aren&#39;t as <br/>\nhungry as I thought when they don&#39;t stay at the table, but struggle <br/>\nwith it as this behaviour is not the &quot;norm&quot; in our circle of <br/>\nfriends.  The 6 yr old is pretty good at other people&#39;s houses as she <br/>\nunderstands that other people have different &quot;rules&quot; but the kids <br/>\nboth struggle and I grit my teeth with that stupid what-will-others-<br/>\nthink voice in my head or find myself not letting them eat before <br/>\ngoing over to another&#39;s house so they will be hungry enought to stay <br/>\nat the table for a while. As I said I am trying to find a balance and <br/>\nhow to handle this and not to have unrealistic expectations of them. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor lack of a better term they are both very impulsive and very <br/>\neasily distracted compared to other kids I know, especially my girl.  <br/>\nI am sure she would be labled ADD/ with certain highly sensitive <br/>\naspects in a school setting...that&#39;s why we unschool.  She has been <br/>\nstarting to go into the fridge to get herself a yoghurt or something <br/>\nif she is hungry and I let her but then she won&#39;t eat at supper and <br/>\nthen her whole day has been eating 99% dairy products or fruit and <br/>\nnothing else or something despite having other things readily <br/>\navailable...or I will give her a few pieces of candy before supper if <br/>\nshe asks thinking she has every right to just like I would and <br/>\nstruggle in my own mind when I see her eat 2 bites the rest of the <br/>\nevening because she is not hungry now. She is tiny for her age so <br/>\nthat adds to my worries. I have even gotten so upset that I have told <br/>\nher that no she can&#39;t have any candy because she has proven to me <br/>\nthat she can&#39;t eat a decent meal afterwards (hanging my head in <br/>\nshame) and then felt bad, that is how much the pendulum in my mind <br/>\nswings in this right now<br/>\n<br/>\nAny strategies anyone, for calming that voice that tells me they will <br/>\nnever stay at the table or eat a balanced diet?  Basically my <br/>\nstrategy lately has been making 3 fairly regular meals in the day <br/>\nplus a tray of snacky type foods in the fridge like cut up fruit, <br/>\nveggies, muffins, crackers and cheese, etc.  But when they just eat a <br/>\nfew nibbles off this CONSTANTLY during the day, and not anything else <br/>\nit bothers me, as there is my mom in my head with the thoughts of I <br/>\nworked hard to make this meal, so you eat it!  Or another voice which <br/>\nthinks that they will be adults and still eat this way and not eat <br/>\nwhen over for company or something....silly I know!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who is going through something simular, please help!  I am <br/>\ntrying to relax more in this area but obviously have a lot to let go <br/>\nof and have not relaxed as much as I thought!
