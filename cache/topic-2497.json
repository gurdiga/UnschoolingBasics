When Jayn struggles with something, hmmmm I&#39;m actually<br/>\ntrying to recall an occasion when she has found something difficult enough<br/>\nthat she has gotten really angry. She tends to just ask for help, like<br/>\ngetting past one obstacle in one of her computer games, or stop for a while.<br/>\nI guess I just validate it &quot;Gee that looks complicated&quot; or &quot;Oh, you have to<br/>\nstart again&quot;, or more often not make any comment at all. Historically she<br/>\nhas always been able to accomplish whatever it is, given time, the next time<br/>\nor the next whenever. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs Jayn has never been in school, the only residual schoolthink in our lives<br/>\nbelongs to dh and I - she has no concept of timed tests for example, other<br/>\nthan beating the clock within a computer or x-box game. The consequences of<br/>\n&quot;failure&quot; are simply &quot;do it again&quot;, so no big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

He understands all about electronics and motors etc. but still has<br/>\nno interest in learning about other math that may be on the tests. I am<br/>\nletting him make his own choices and I am hoping he will learn what he needs<br/>\nwhen he needs it. I know that is not very confident but I haven&#39;t gone<br/>\nthrough a child wanting to go to a trade school. \r<br/>\n  We have known 2 families that homeschooled in a relaxed way. When their<br/>\nkids hit their teenage/high school years they became very resentful of their<br/>\nparents not keeping them up to grade level.I have surmised that part of it<br/>\nwas one families kids had several ps friends and it made a difference in how<br/>\nthey viewed themselves. The oldest daughter had opted for ps and shared all<br/>\nshe was doing or able to do.In the other family they weren&#39;t around other ps<br/>\nkids but for some reason they were upset.Probably influences I knew nothing<br/>\nabout or things going on internally that I didn&#39;t see. That has been my <br/>\nsecret&quot; fear.....would love to feel confident enough to let go of it for<br/>\ngood.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n**\r<br/>\nOf course if you spend your time anxiously watching for math &quot;teachable\r<br/>\nmoments&quot; to appear, and saying things like &quot;This is really hard stuff, so\r<br/>\ndon&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get it right away&quot; even in your own mind, you are\r<br/>\nwell on the way to creating math phobia without a school to assist you.**\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  If your child is struggling over figuring out the answer are you saying it<br/>\nwould be the wrong wording to say...&quot;take your time and don&#39;t feel bad if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t get it the first time?&quot;  If so please explain.\r<br/>\nThis is something I would say or have said.
