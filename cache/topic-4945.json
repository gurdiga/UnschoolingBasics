I think I had already done much healing before  I had <br/>\never even pondered homeschooling.  I went through a period where it  felt <br/>\nright to write down goals and things I wanted to happen for myself and my  <br/>\nfamily.  I guess it helped me feel &#39;in the moment&#39; at that time.  It  took me awhile <br/>\nto refine this statement, but eventually my favorite affirmation  to write <br/>\nwas &quot;My family learns in peace and joy&quot;.  I would write it over  and over and <br/>\nfeel very peaceful.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy preconceived ideas of how that statement would be fulfilled looked  pretty <br/>\ndifferent than unschooling (had no ideas about that at all) but more like  <br/>\nhappy, ideal schools.  Then, as my oldest entered preschool, it fell way  short <br/>\nof that image in my head.  I started looking into homeschooling, but  it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t sit right with me either and my child was never going to do any sort  of <br/>\n&quot;work&quot; with me.   I felt very confused.<br/>\n <br/>\nThen one day, following the little rabbit trails of homeschooling links on  <br/>\nthe web, I read about unschooling.  EUREKA!  The heavens parted and I  swear I  <br/>\ncould almost hear voices in my head shouting &quot;this is it!  do  this!&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nWell, it took a lot of courage, but I have never doubted that I am exactly  <br/>\nwhere I am supposed to be.  I never quite know what to answer when people  ask <br/>\nme why I homeschool...I really want to say &quot;because God made me do it&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie in SC  (Nick, 8 and Emmy, 4)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4934,"nextTopicId":4952}}
