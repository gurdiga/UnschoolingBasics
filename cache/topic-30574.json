Thankyou Caren, for responding to my post... you asked ... What I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1543912691\">I posted this a few days ago, but it seems to have been buried...I hope its okay to repost!<br/>\n<br/>\nThankyou Caren, for responding to my post...<br/>\nyou asked<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What is the testing situation there? Does it have to be given by<br/>\n&gt; someone else?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I have been told by other homeschoolers is that testing is not<br/>\nrequired by law unless returning into the public school<br/>\nsystem...however if a principle decides to want testing annually, he<br/>\ncould make things difficult... though Ive no way of know if this<br/>\nactually has happened., nor in what way.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately here in italy it is a very unused schooling option, much<br/>\nless unschooling! The only forum that deals with homeschooling is a<br/>\nChristian (7th day adventists) one and their attitude is very much<br/>\nlike the one described int the Re:Testing in the schoolboard<br/>\nthread...they want the government out of their lives as much as<br/>\npossible so they do annual testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does it have to be given by someone else?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For returning into the school system it is given by the school of acceptance.<br/>\nfor the annual testing it seems to be also done by the school in the<br/>\narea...tho as I say this is all rather fuzzy, law wise, it is NOt done<br/>\nso they just ad lib, is my guess! So I am wondering how I could<br/>\napproach this, in a knowlegeable non aggressive way...Id like to *not*<br/>\ntest if this is possible....and if dd must test, then Id like to do it<br/>\nat home, at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, in NC, we are required to test. Not to pass the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; test, just to give it and have the results on file. I&#39;ve always<br/>\n&gt; administered the test myself. And by administer, I mean I give the<br/>\n&gt; test by my rules, no one else&#39;s: I don&#39;t set a timer, I help, we do<br/>\n&gt; the questions together if they want. (shh. don&#39;t tell anybody that<br/>\n&gt; last one) There&#39;s no text anxiety, &#39;cause it&#39;s just a piece of paper<br/>\n&gt; to fill out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course this would be ideal, if I had to test. However, italy does<br/>\nnot use standardized tests yet. If they did, she probably wouldnt be<br/>\nso scared either, she likes workbookish type questions and<br/>\nanswers...mainly because she thinks they are funny (she wonders how<br/>\nthey think up such stupid questions)...<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever it will most likely be the usual stuff a dictation, a<br/>\ncomprehension for reading, some math all with the teachers there (whom<br/>\nshe has a real fear of...)<br/>\n<br/>\nId like to manage this somehow to turn it into a non issue--of course<br/>\nthe best hope is dialogue with the principle...which I am due to do<br/>\nthis week---<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And I ask you - when else is that the case? When is someone<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; completely alone, with no resources except what they remember? Testing<br/>\n&gt; is bizarre. Well, sure - a surgeon, I wouldn&#39;t really want her in the<br/>\n&gt; operating room clicking on google - but that&#39;s at *such* a different<br/>\n&gt; level than most folks operate in, in their daily lives. (clever use of<br/>\n&gt; operate - didja catch that?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lol, yes! and it is so true. especially absurd for a 7 or 8 year old.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; OK, sorry - back to the question. We are also not required to test<br/>\n&gt; until they&#39;re required to register as a homeschooler, at age 7.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So - my question - what are the legal requirements (not<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; recommendations) where you live? Maybe we can see how to work within<br/>\n&gt; those parameters.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hope ive been as clear as I can be, given the very unclear circumstances!<br/>\nthank you and Im looking forward to your reply (ies)...<br/>\nmelissa<br/>\nin italy<br/>\nmamma di 7<br/>\nlucia 20.5yr, lidia 17yr, matteo 14yr, raffaele 10yr, elena shanti<br/>\n7.75yr, giacomo leo 4.75yr and gioele 2.25y<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.attachmentparenting.eu\">http://www.attachmentparenting.eu</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.larimeloom.etsy.com\">http://www.larimeloom.etsy.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flauto.tk\">http://www.flauto.tk</a><br/>\n<br/>\nthis i posted originally<br/>\n&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;Hi, I would be interested in knowing also how others have dealt with the issue<br/>\nof testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand totally not having anysort of investment in *how* my child<br/>\nscores...My<br/>\nconcern is rather connected to the fact that my dd5 will have to test period. <br/>\nIn Italy the<br/>\ntest will probably not be very schematic...they tend to do &quot;interrogations&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;dictations&quot;<br/>\ntho in the past 5 years they have moved more towards annual inclass &quot;quiz&quot;s that<br/>\nobserve<br/>\nthe childs incoming and outgoing knowlege...<br/>\n(I know about this as I have older children in school still)<br/>\n<br/>\nmy concern is for easing exam anxiety--<br/>\n<br/>\nthankyou melissa in italy&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30350,"nextTopicId":30579}}
