We developed a system where I would slip a note under his door if it was closed for privacy, and when he was not otherwise occupied, he would come out and address the issue at hand, whether it be food, a request to hang out with me for some activity, etc. This way, he knew the topic at hand and could think about what he wanted without feeling interrupted or as if his need for privacy was not being respected. Now, if he wants my attention for something, he comes to me and asks if I would mind scheduling time to talk to him at my convenience. He is still extremely attached to gaming, but now he plays in the living room and will pause at a convenient spot if I request his attention. I hope you are able to find a system which works for you and leaves everyone feeling respected.<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":365496082,"authorName":"mbyerly77@yahoo.com","from":"&quot;mbyerly77@...&quot; &lt;mbyerly77@...&gt;","profile":"mbyerly77","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Gaming etiquette was Disrepect?","postDate":"1298058190","msgId":46178,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0MjE4ODExMDIuNjg2OS4xMjk4MDU4MTkxMDMwLkphdmFNYWlsLnNldmVuQGFwMS5wMC5zamMuN3N5cy5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46179,"prevInTime":46177,"nextInTime":46179,"topicId":46178,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think an explanation of gaming etiquette could be helpful in understanding upset over a perceived interruption resulting in getting killed .

My sister and I had an atari and later, our best neighbor friends had a nintendo. Later in my life I witnessed the evolution of games and gaming when i had a long-term boyfriend who was an avid gamer.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that evolved naturally and soon after the invention of video games and seems to have not changed over the years, was the unspoken, implied etiquette of &quot;interrupting&quot; while playing. Interrupting included, but was not limited to talking, moving, or making any other &quot;noise&quot; that could disrupt the player or players and cause them to &quot;die&quot;, go back a level, have to start over, lose their turn, or interfere with any game status they were trying to achieve.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe disruption was considered worse at &quot;critical&quot; moments (about to &quot;die&quot;, about to get to next level, about to be champion of day, game, of present players, etc.). Players knew this. If they breached etiquette, by &quot;interrupting&quot; at an inappropriate time, they were generally reminded of the etiquette by the &quot;interrupted&quot; player(s) saying, for example, &quot;dude, you made me die!&quot;. Depending on severity of etiquette mistake the offender might even be yelled at or even shunned by the other players until he learned to interrupt at the appropriate time.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of video games tend to cycle with easier parts, harder parts, and built in breaks (level changes, information, and even &quot;dying&quot;). The &quot;easy&quot; parts and &quot;breaks&quot; would be, from a gamer&#39;s perspective, the appropriate time to &quot;interrupt&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this might help understand a gamer&#39;s  perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46110,"nextTopicId":46182}}
