My older three had attended public school up until 4 years ago. My youngest has never attended.<br/>\n   <br/>\n               They all learned to read and spell at school except for the youngest. I have never done any formal reading or spelling  instuction with him to learn these skills. To help him learn to read I did teach him letter sounds when he asked and sat with him when he wanted to practice his reading. I have been amazed at what he has learned with very little help. My problem is he is frustated that he can not read better. He wants to pick up a book and read every word like I do. He likes to hear me read smooth and fast and would like to do the same.  To him if he is sounding out some words then he really doesn&#39;t know how to read ( His Words) I tell him he can read maybe it&#39;s not every single word but it will come to him the more he reads. And that everyone has words they come across that they may not know and that It doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t read. My problem is that He wants me to help him and I&#39;m really not sure how to do this when he doesn&#39;t always want to practice and so we<br/>\n don&#39;t.

He will show me what he is spelling and ask if it is correct and I tell him the missing letter or added letter to take out. He is fine with this. Most of what he wants to spell is things to play online games and wants his spelling to be correct so others understand him. Usually he brings me paper tells me what he wants to say I write it and he goes and types it in. This works but its hard for him to carry a conversation doing this. He is upset because of his reading and spelling he can not play as well as he would like. He has gotten kicked out of groups because someone is talking to him and he feels he can&#39;t keep up with all the reading and typing. He picks and choses when he wants to respond and is comfortable with. He has asked us to teach him to spell mostly to play the games better. I have let him now that<br/>\n the people in the games do not care if his spelling is perfect or if he writes in complete sentences. That some times people say one or two words and its fine. He isn&#39;t happy doing this he wants it to be spelled correctly and in a complete sentence.He is frustrated with his abilities. <br/>\n   <br/>\n              Any advise on how to help him to learn these things without pressure and in a natural way that he would enjoy. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jennie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!
