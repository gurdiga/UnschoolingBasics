Hanging fabric or a blanket over a door can also help absorb sound. For awhile Ray had black curtains (cheapo polyester fabric, nothing glamorous) so he could sleep in without the light waking him and we&#39;d work to keep Mo quiet in the morning, volume on the tv turned down, that sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Mo was younger, either George or I would stay awake, or half-awake, to mediate between Ray and Mo as needed. I wasn&#39;t working at the time (and George is a night owl) so we could take turns with that. The biggest issue in our house has been that when things get rowdy, its usually a matter of the kids getting on each others nerves. If they&#39;re just having fun, a shout from the bedroom is enough to remind them to be quiet, but when they&#39;re not happy with each other, they need some help or to get away from each other - and in our house, the only &quot;away&quot; is bedrooms.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"gruvystarchild","from":"&quot;gruvystarchild&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: help.....","postDate":"1251929660","msgId":41215,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg3bXFucytkNnFiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk5MTQ0MC4xODMzOC5xbUB3ZWIzNjkwNS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":41213,"nextInTopic":41220,"prevInTime":41214,"nextInTime":41216,"topicId":41208,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~Staying up on your own schedule is one thing, keeping the rest of the family up is completely another.  We asked the kids last night to turn down the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1408845665\">~~Staying up on your own schedule is one thing, keeping the rest of the family up is completely another.  We asked the kids last night to turn down the TV--and they did, and then we went to sleep, and I assume they did eventually, too, since they were asleep this morning.  But it would NOT be ok  for them to be keeping me up--I have to open the coffee shop at 7 am and would NOT be a happy camper to have not slept!  Giving your kids freedom shouldn&#39;t be at your own and husband&#39;s expense!~~<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree.

I&#39;m really clear about it when there is likely to be a<br/>\nnoisy evening. When David goes to bed, things have to get quieter or they get<br/>\nshut down. When I go to bed, same deal. I&#39;ve stopped play because someone was<br/>\ntoo loud. I wouldn&#39;t spend time explaining it. I would simply say, too loud,<br/>\nkeep it quiet or got to bed. And if they wake me or David again, they go to<br/>\nbed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t a right to stay up and annoy people. Unschoolers aren&#39;t saying that<br/>\nchildren have a right to stay up late at night. Certainly I&#39;m not. I&#39;m saying<br/>\nthat some children have difrerent sleep patterns and working to make it easier<br/>\nfor them is a good thing. I was a night owl. I had a really hard time going to sleep<br/>\nearly as a child. I would read or watch television or do other things. That<br/>\ncarried on into my adult life and I still will, sometimes, stay up late and do<br/>\nsomething quietly. But being rowdy and disturbing others would mean that I had<br/>\nto stop whatever I was doing. Even if that meant lying in bed not able to<br/>\nsleep. Fortunately it doesn&#39;t. I have lots of options. I can play on my ds, I<br/>\ncan read with a reading light that doesn&#39;t disturb my co-sleepers, I can go to<br/>\na different bedroom, I can listen to a book on the ipod. I could come<br/>\ndownstairs and go into the furthest room from the sleepers and watch a movie. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre there ways that you can make your daughter&#39;s room darker? I&#39;ve safety<br/>\npinned blankets onto curtains to make it easier to sleep through the morning<br/>\nsun in one bedroom. It isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s certainly better than without<br/>\nthe blankets. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout your son telling people how late he slept in, tell him your concerns. Not<br/>\nabout CPS, maybe, but certainly about how others will perceive you as a<br/>\nneglectful mother and him as a child at some risk because of the things he&#39;s<br/>\nsaying in public to people who would frown on those kinds of behaviours. He may<br/>\nbe bragging because he&#39;s so pleased about his freedoms.

Our eldest is a night kid, and that is fine, but I am not finding any good solutions to help all 3 kids get into a pattern of sleep that seems to work for them.  It was going great for a while.  Youngest was doing her thing and going to bed early, middle was going around midnight, teen stayed up till 3-4ish but was quiet...<br/>\n<br/>\nLately it has been youngest doesn&#39;t want to miss out on anything the brothers are doing so she is staying up and not getting enough sleep.  The next morning when the light wakes her up as usual she is moody and needing more sleep. The middle one is trying to outdo the eldest on who can stay up and create legos later or play a video game the longest....or just playing around and the noise is driving me crazy!  We have discussed being respectful of those who have to be on a different schedule and how I need it a little quieter so I can sleep if they don&#39;t want me to be irritable and cranky too.  I am having trouble finding ways to help everyone see that lack of sleep is causing most of the fights of the past couple weeks and that either middle child needs a nap during the day or more sleep at night or something!

He is constantly tired and ready to say enough experimenting already.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems to be the main problem we are having.  We are trying to work things out so everyone will be able to have as much time on a computer as they feel they need so maybe eldest won&#39;t *need* to stay up till 5 or 6 on some days...maybe not.  Those things take time and as we live on a budget in the real world we can&#39;t just go out and get everything they think they need today.  So it has taken time, but we are almost there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, how do you deal with the people who freak and make you wonder if you will have CPS at your door? For example teen son said, &quot;I didn&#39;t get up till 6 today, so I am not quite awake yet&quot; (he was up at 4:30 actually) and the people around were giving us that concerned or &quot;what is wrong with you&quot; look.  I don&#39;t have a problem with it if it stays here in the house, but I don&#39;t like feeling like I have to explain our family every time we are out.  Does anyone else ever feel that way?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know the stress of breaking off ties with my family has been difficult for everyone lately, but now that it is done I am sure it will be better for all of us.  I hope. Maybe that was part of the issue as well.  Still, figuring out how to meet everyone&#39;s needs regarding sleep has made me feel I just can&#39;t handle this. Just so you all know, I do remind kids of the time (which they asked me to do so they can prepare for bed at a time they are comfortable with) but it all seems to have been thrown out the window in the past few weeks.  Am I missing something?  I try talking with them to see if something is bothering them, offering to make tea or read with them, to help them pick up so they can get to bed or snuggle, but none of that seems to be what is needed right now.  I just feel I am missing part of the puzzle.  I usually end up sleeping in or having to nap mid-day and it just makes me feel completely off. :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Just so you all know, I do remind kids of the time (which they asked me to do so they can prepare for bed at a time they are comfortable with) but it all seems to have been thrown out the window in the past few weeks.  Am I missing something?  I try talking with them to see if something is bothering them, offering to make tea or read with them, to help them pick up so they can get to bed or snuggle, but none of that seems to be what is needed right now.  I just feel I am missing part of the puzzle.  I usually end up sleeping in or having to nap mid-day and it just makes me feel completely off. :(</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41200,"nextTopicId":41255}}
