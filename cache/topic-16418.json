I dont know if thats a good thing to do or not.  He seems to have all his needs met, I respond whenever he calls and we spend alot of time doing things together etc as does his Dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that the idiot comment is one he likes from TV so I guess it will pass, but do you react to comments such as that.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust had a thought, when we were going to church there was a boy who was 8 that started hitting DS and pushing him etc whenever he got the chance.

Plus they know they can quit anytime they choose. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  If its a rule I ask myself is this really necessary? If its something I really need I let my needs be known and try to come up with something the benefits everyone. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I ask myself really often....Does this really make sense or are you saying it because its the traditional parent response you heard as a child?<br/>\n  a few examples of this......<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Courtney went to go play at a friend house a street over. When she came home she said mom put my bike up for me please. My first instinct would have been its your bike you are responsible for it  instead of wow its really hot outside bet she needs a drink and time to cool off its great that she is caring for her bike and realizes it needs to be put up...I bet that garage door is a strugle for her little 40lb body.  But is this really fair of coniderate? certainly not! esp when I ask her to do things for me many times a day. I usualy say ok to her requests for help and from this example she usualy says yes to me. <br/>\n  There are occasions where we say no or wait. Today Nathaniel smeared pink trix yogurt into brand new carpet in our rental house. So I felt that I really needed to get out our green machine and clean it right away before it stained. <br/>\n  Courtney wanted me to get her food and I said please get something yourself or wait 15 minutes. Now I do this is it really kind to expect her to immediatly drop whatever she is working on because I have decided I want her room clean?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ANyhow you asked for books :) Ive heard that Rue &#39;s book is fantastic from people on and off this list. Unfortunatly I havent read it because were to darn broke to order  a $14 book :(<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Also I think sandra dodd&#39;s webiste has a lot of useful parenting and unschooling info on it..........anyone have a link?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nTalk is cheap.
