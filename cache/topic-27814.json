Before we joined I didn&#39;t know about the policy about scouts not being alone, but the leader did mention this when she went over to &quot;talk&quot; to my daughter. I forgot that we have choices about the group we can go to. I will definitely take your advice and explore other groups and I think you are right, perhaps it was too much in one day for my daughter (it was actually a camping skills day and she earned a badge), since she is rarely in a group environment.  It&#39;s an adjustment. Yes, i didn&#39;t really know that all of the different (levels) of scouts would be attending and i&#39;m certain my daughter wasn&#39;t thrilled - it was just too much. Not to mention all of the activities one after the other. Many of the things didn&#39;t interest her.  One good thing, the daisy troop leader (not the lady I was referring to earlier) told me that there are some homeschoolers out here - which i   would have never known since i haven&#39;t crossed paths with any here yet.

Your<br/>\nlocal Girl Scout Council will provide all the training and resources<br/>\nthat you need.  Then, you can encourage your daughter and fellow troop<br/>\nmembers to select the activities that appeal to them.

When my troop consisted of 14 six-year-olds, I have to admit it<br/>\nwas very difficult to take a back seat.

She attended an all <br/>\nday event.  I stayed for the entire thing...It felt like school! She <br/>\nkept wandering off when she felt like it and the &quot;troop leader&quot; had <br/>\nto keep calling her back. Then at one point, she got angry about my <br/>\nnot having brought her sleeping bag (she thought that the older <br/>\ngirls were going to camp out - they weren&#39;t) and she walked away <br/>\nangry. My husband was there too and the head of the whole thing said <br/>\nthat we couldn&#39;t let her walk away from the group because people <br/>\nparticipating cannot be alone and that she was going to talk to her <br/>\n(if that was okay with us). Myself and my  husband (even though we <br/>\nhadn&#39;t talked about it) had in our minds that we were going to let <br/>\nher have her feelings (away from the group, physically she had moved <br/>\naway but was close enough for us to see/watch her - I felt <br/>\ncomfortable with being able to see her).   I knew she would <br/>\neventually come back once she had her feelings about it.  Plus, my <br/>\nexperience has been when she is angry that she needs that space to <br/>\nfeel it and then I am able to talk with her.  Anyway, the head of <br/>\nthe thing (who obviously was very uncomfortable with our daughter <br/>\nand her expression of her feelings and basically her whole &quot;way&quot; of <br/>\nbeing - asked me to accompany her while she talked to our daughter.  <br/>\nShe proceeded to tell her the &quot;rules&quot; that no girl participating <br/>\ncould be alone at any time during the event and that she (our <br/>\ndaughter) needed to come and join the group.  Our daughter tried to <br/>\nsay how she felt and the woman just shut her down and when my <br/>\ndaughter turned away from her and started getting angrier, the woman <br/>\ndemanded that she look at her &quot;you will look at me,&quot; etc. It was a <br/>\nterrible display of verbal/emotional abuse and I let it happen~ I <br/>\nhave a whole set of guilt about that. I know I failed my daughter <br/>\ncompletely in this situation.  She and I have talked about it and <br/>\nhad a good cry about it.  She said she forgave me and I thank god <br/>\nthat she has such a tremendous amount of forgiveness, brilliance, <br/>\nlove, acceptance.  All my intention was for her going in the first <br/>\nplace was for her to make some friends.  She has no girl friends <br/>\nhere and craves the connection with other girls.   This is a <br/>\nsituation that has happened in other places with my daughter - other <br/>\nadults verbally and emotionally targeting her for her just &quot;being&quot; - <br/>\nat church (unitarian), and just in general - one guy my daughter <br/>\nscowled at told my husband that he should beat her (&quot;she needs to <br/>\nlearn manners&quot;) - of course, when she scowls at him it&#39;s for a <br/>\nreason, the guy is angry, mean, and has been sarcastic and mean with <br/>\nher before and she doesn&#39;t like him. I realize, when I really think <br/>\nabout it, my daughters feelings, reactions mostly seem to be <br/>\ngrounded in something.
