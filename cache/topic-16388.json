Now my friend","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-520082618\">Hey there radical unschoolers,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have been observing this group for a couple of weeks now from a <br/>\nsuggestion from my good friend and unschooler.  Now my friend has <br/>\nbeen unschooling her child since she was born basically and I have <br/>\nalways admired and adored A&#39;s relationship with her daughter.  So <br/>\nhere&#39;s the story I have a beautiful son that I have been at wits end <br/>\ntrying to figure out the right way <br/>\nto &quot;raise&quot;, &quot;discipline&quot;, &quot;school&quot;.  And with great patience and <br/>\nlove my friend A has led me to at least think about unschooling more <br/>\nseriously.  Below is a e-mail that I just sent her and feel that <br/>\nthis group may be able to help also.  If you can&#39;t follow my <br/>\nrambling please say so and I will try to clarify!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOK Andrea,  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading some of the discussions on the un-schooling group and <br/>\ngetting on that Sandra Dodd website I have had an epipheny (sp??)&gt;  <br/>\nBasically I just hit myself over the head and thought ---&quot;I am <br/>\nfinally getting what Andrea has gently been trying to explain to me <br/>\nabout &quot;unschooling!!&quot;  Plus, I&#39;m bombarded with a bunch of quilt <br/>\n(which I will work through of course)&gt;   Anyway, here I am in a <br/>\nquandry of tempory dilemma&#39;s.  First, I started back to school 2 <br/>\nyears ago to get a Master&#39;s degree in teaching so that &quot;I could feel <br/>\nqualified to &quot;teach&quot; Ian.&quot;  Plus, I have been following a spiritual <br/>\npath that screams for me not to be judged, allow for everyone to <br/>\nhave freedoms, etc, etc, etc.  Yet, here I have been imposing <br/>\ncontrol on my son....OH God/Goddess... What do I do now???  Here I <br/>\nam a mother of 2 beautiful boys and a &quot;step mother&quot; to two others.   <br/>\nNow I&#39;m really leaning towards home/unschooling yet I just went <br/>\nthrough all this schooling -- plus-- UGH I have the &#39;school&#39; mind <br/>\nsometimes.  Where do I start?  I already told Ian he would be able <br/>\nto go to pre-school/headstart and even ride the bus.....  but now I <br/>\nwant to take it back... plus How do I un-school -- 1)-- while I&#39;m <br/>\nworking (and most likely at a school), 2) how can I get --oops - <br/>\nhelp Tom to understand my choices and hopefully get him on the band <br/>\nwagon -- because he already thinks I&#39;m too leniant, etc.. 3) how do <br/>\nwe blend this family if we both can&#39;t get on the same thought <br/>\npattern?    AHHHHHH I&#39;m excited and know in my bones that this is <br/>\nthe right path yet I am so scared why???   Love you and call me <br/>\nsoon...even though I&#39;m going to see you this weekend. Becca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nP&gt;s.  I think I&#39;m going to send this message I just wrote you to the <br/>\nunschoolers site.. Don&#39;t worry my feelings won&#39;t get hurt..<br/>\n<br/>\nOK UNSCHOOLERS I&#39;M READY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS!!! BRING THEM ON!!!<br/>\nRebecca De Hate</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16354,"nextTopicId":16356}}
