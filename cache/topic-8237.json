But oftentimes, whatever we helped with turned out to be fun and connecting, especially yardwork.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;She created a dividing line between her/adult world and my and my sisters  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;kid world. Her world was the household and ours was playing. It was,  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in many ways, a great childhood because our job was to play and watch  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;TV and read and explore freely. Despite the fact that I went to  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;school I learned tons of stuff on my own (which helped me get  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;unschooling :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My mother created that same line in many ways.  She worked outside the home.  I remember staying at home with my brothers with my mother supervising us from work as early as 9 yrs old (My older brother was 11 at the time).  Our neighbor worked nights so she was our surrougate mother if there was an emergency or we needed adult attention.  Since becoming a mother, I thought about how many of my insecurity issues were a result of being bottlefed, not co-sleeping, going to daycare from infancy and going to school.  However, since I have begun hsing, especially unschooling, I am realizing just how creative my brothers and I were as a result of being home by ourselves.  We always came up with neat recipes and I read all the magazines that laid around the house out of boredom, especially Reader&#39;s Digest.  Also, because my mother wanted us to be children for as long as possible, play is what my brothers and I did best.  I can relate to your experiences, Joyce.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But I didn&#39;t really know my mom despite the fact that she was a stay  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;at home mom.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My mother worked out side the home all of my life but we were close.  Our personalities were similar.  I also remember my mother always going on and on about how much she loved me and how much smarter I was than she was when she was my age at the time.  The latter remarked always shocked me because she was perfect in my mind but I guess that it left an impression and caused me to respect her even more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My daughter knows me a lot better :-) And we&#39;re very much a part of  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;each other&#39;s worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I love that.

My mom was a single<br/>\nworking mom and it was just the way it was. I hate to clean and am not the<br/>\ngreatest housekeeper. My sister loves to clean (it&#39;s really fun for her) and<br/>\ndoes it well.  My kids are not &quot;required&quot; to clean, or cook, or do laundry.<br/>\nBtu they all do their own laundry, they all know how to cook, they all can<br/>\nclean just fine. Sometimes they clean up if it is messy and they have time,<br/>\nor if they have company coming over. Almost always they will help if I need<br/>\nhelp and ask.  And at long last, they (usually) pick up after themselves and<br/>\ntheir guests. But that is after years of me helping them do that as<br/>\nchildren.  Laundry they do because it is a help to me, but I will gladly<br/>\nhelp them if they need or want something clean and don&#39;t have time to do<br/>\nlaundry.  I think some of it is just personality. My daughter, Lisa, likes<br/>\nthings neat and tidy and will do lots to keep it that way.  Though this does<br/>\nnot come naturally to me, I have tried to be better about it lately as it<br/>\nmatters to her.  My oldest hates to clean the kitchen, but will gladly do<br/>\nerrands or extra laundry.  My youngest used to love to clean bathrooms, he<br/>\nwould beg to do it. I would sprinkle in the cleaning stuff and let him go at<br/>\nit. I would need to go in with a big towel and wipe the room down, but it<br/>\nwas clean and he loved doing it. He will still clean bathrooms and he&#39;s not<br/>\nquite as wet when he is done anymore.    <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to messy rooms, even before embracing unschooling I never made<br/>\nthe kids clean their rooms. I would work with them when they wanted it clean<br/>\nor surprise them. Lisa&#39;s room was usually clean, Kate&#39;s was the proverbial 2<br/>\nfeet deep room.  Fast forward to now and both keep their rooms spotless.<br/>\nMuch cleaner than mine. They didn&#39;t need me to make them do it all their<br/>\nlives to want a clean room and have the ability to keep it that way. In<br/>\nfact, they keep their rooms much cleaner than most of their friends who were<br/>\nforced to clean their rooms all those years.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the expectation of having things done for them, that is all about<br/>\nmodeling. Being &#39;made&#39; to do chores and such will not create a grateful,<br/>\nresponsible child. Nor will it create a child that desires orderliness.<br/>\nThis comes by a child seeing a parent joyfully and freely giving to and<br/>\ndoing for others, including their children. It comes from seeing parents<br/>\nhelping each other out. It comes from kids being a part of their parent&#39;s<br/>\nworld.  And I&#39;m convinced that some of it is just genetics!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-19, Lisa-16, Karl-14, & Ben-10.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reachhomeschool.com\">http://www.reachhomeschool.com</a>&gt; www.reachhomeschool.com<br/>\n<br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art!     &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artkunst23.com/\">http://www.artkunst23.com/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artkunst23.com\">http://www.artkunst23.com</a><br/>\n&quot;Know where to find the information and how to use it - That&#39;s the secret of<br/>\nsuccess.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955)<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Mother Earth (Tyra)<br/>\nSent: Monday, December 12, 2005 11:46 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] How do they learn responsibility WAS Intro and<br/>\nquestion<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am seeing the theme of clean the room as a gift to the child.  As a young<br/>\nperson, I made a decision to help my children by not doing too much for<br/>\nthem.  My mother (God rest her soul) was a great mother.  She washed our<br/>\nclothes, folded, them, ironed them, she always did so much for us.  I never<br/>\nremember feeling gratitude because I thought that that was what mothers did<br/>\nbecause she always did so much for us.  Once I got out on my own and<br/>\nrealized what I had to do for myself was what my mother always did for a<br/>\nfamily of 5, I felt grateful and wondered why Mama never insisted that we do<br/>\nmore for ourselves as we got older.  My sons are 2 and 5 yrs, respectively.<br/>\nI have tried the clean up your room command, I have helped him clean his<br/>\nroom and I will clean the room when I can&#39;t stand it, because they don&#39;t<br/>\ncomplain about the messiness.  But, at some point, I want my children to<br/>\nvalue having the ability to clean and to actually self-initiate cleaning.<br/>\nPartly because of my experience as a child, but also because since having<br/>\nchildren, I have been disappointed that my husband does not feel moved to do<br/>\nmore around the house considering that I have always done so much for the<br/>\nchildren.  Also, I see how my father-in-law is and I don&#39;t want sons who<br/>\nthink that house work is beneath them.  I want them to understand that it is<br/>\nokay for men to clean because I want to them to do a better job of taking<br/>\ncare of their wives when they get married and subsequently have children<br/>\nsince that is something that is lacking in this culture.  And let me end<br/>\nwith saying that I know that I am totally operating from my stuff, but<br/>\nlaziness in men cleaning around the house seems to be pervasive.  I have not<br/>\nfully understood if it is nurture versus nature.  If nurturing can help,<br/>\nthen I want sons who are at least open to doing housework.  At the very<br/>\nleast I explain to my sons that I value a neat home so there are times when<br/>\nthat is exactly what I am going to do in that moment.  That way they at<br/>\nleast have the example of a person who values picking up around the house<br/>\nevery now and again.  And while I am on a roll, I also feel that I have had<br/>\nto evolve into a person who knows how to clean.

It didn&#39;t make  <br/>\nsense. **<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the problem was that she didn&#39;t invite us to help. She  <br/>\ncreated a dividing line between her/adult world and my and my sisters  <br/>\nkid world. Her world was the household and ours was playing. It was,  <br/>\nin many ways, a great childhood because our job was to play and watch  <br/>\nTV and read and explore freely. Despite the fact that I went to  <br/>\nschool I learned tons of stuff on my own (which helped me get  <br/>\nunschooling :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I didn&#39;t really know my mom despite the fact that she was a stay  <br/>\nat home mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter knows me a lot better :-) And we&#39;re very much a part of  <br/>\neach other&#39;s worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\n** (Even now when people are doing things I assume they&#39;re doing them  <br/>\nbecause they want to and I have to stop and consciously think to  <br/>\nthank them.

Here&#39;s  <br/>\nhow I think it might not turn into that kind of mindset:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Around the house, kids will see helping going in all directions. I  <br/>\nsay to my partner, &quot;David, it would really help me if you had a  <br/>\nminute to unload the dishwasher,&quot; and David says, &quot;Oh, OK, I can do  <br/>\nthat right after dinner.&quot; Or I say, &quot;Let&#39;s get Daddy a special flavor  <br/>\nof ice cream. Won&#39;t that be a nice surprise for him?&quot; and let my 4 yo  <br/>\nparticipate in choosing the flavor and springing the surprise. It&#39;s  <br/>\nnot a one-way street with all help and support going towards the  <br/>\nkids; it&#39;s going in all directions and kids can jump in at will.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. We also model respect for others when we are out and about. I have  <br/>\na friend who loves to have kids visit, but doesn&#39;t like being left to  <br/>\ndo all the picking up, so one of her rules is that kids who visit  <br/>\nhelp put toys away before they leave. We enjoy visiting this friend,  <br/>\nand my son helps pick up before we leave (so do I, although that&#39;s  <br/>\none place where my friend and I differ--she wants the kids to do it  <br/>\nthemselves, I like to work together). Whatever picking up he does, I  <br/>\naffirm, even if it&#39;s only 3 things to my 30 things. He&#39;s only 4, but  <br/>\nhe knows perfectly well that there are all kinds of things we do at  <br/>\nour house, like jumping on the furniture, eating on the couch, and so  <br/>\non, that most people don&#39;t allow in their homes.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. We find other opportunities to help out. Just today, we stopped at  <br/>\nMcDonald&#39;s for lunch. My toddler noticed a cup that had fallen on the  <br/>\nground near our car (&quot;uh-oh! Cup!&quot;). My 4 yo said, &quot;Carl is right.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s a cup right there!&quot; I said, &quot;Someone must have dropped it. It  <br/>\nwould be a helpful thing for us to pick it up and put it in the  <br/>\ntrash.&quot; I thought I would pick it up, but Eric said, &quot;OK!&quot; and picked  <br/>\nit up, carried it into the restaurant, and put it in the trash.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis also models the idea that a person is NOT solely responsible for  <br/>\nher own things and her own messes. That&#39;s one of the lies we tell  <br/>\nkids: you made the mess, you clean it up. In real life, my friends  <br/>\nand I help each other clean up our messes all the time. Just ten days  <br/>\nago, I discovered a mis-calculation in my finances (I had failed to  <br/>\nenter a purchase in my checkbook) and my friend Scott gave me the  <br/>\nmoney to cover the shortage until next payday so nothing bounced.  <br/>\nEric probably didn&#39;t know all the ins and outs, but he saw Scott  <br/>\nhanding me money and heard me say, &quot;Thanks, Scott, that&#39;s a big  <br/>\nhelp.&quot; I figure stuff like that sinks in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] How do they learn responsibility WAS  Intro and question","postDate":"1134407573","msgId":8241,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDAxYTQwMWM1ZmYzYiQ3OTNjYWNhMCQ2YTAwYThjMEBjb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":8237,"nextInTopic":8244,"prevInTime":8240,"nextInTime":8242,"topicId":8237,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-134603604\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; She washed our clothes, folded, them, ironed them, she always did so<br/>\nmuch for us.

(I hope you had the chance to express it to<br/>\nher before her demise.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the gratitude and the willingness to involve yourself in home<br/>\nkeeping would have come earlier in your youth if outside-the-home<br/>\nactivities, including school, had not been made the primary priorities - if<br/>\nyou were more present during the day to see it happening - but we can never<br/>\nknow. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is wonderful that you get to be grateful to a mother who did all<br/>\nof that without imbuing it with martyrdom and putting the sense of her<br/>\nsacrifice on to you.

I know there are men who<br/>\nare really willing about house stuff, but if they are like James, they still<br/>\nwait to be asked, and have the mindset that they are &quot;helping their wife&quot;<br/>\nwith what is essentially her responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say that I have surrendered to that concept, after feeling prickly<br/>\nfor many years.

My","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1301136568\">I am seeing the theme of clean the room as a gift to the child.  As a young person, I made a decision to help my children by not doing too much for them.  My mother (God rest her soul) was a great mother.  She washed our clothes, folded, them, ironed them, she always did so much for us.  I never remember feeling gratitude because I thought that that was what mothers did because she always did so much for us.  Once I got out on my own and realized what I had to do for myself was what my mother always did for a family of 5, I felt grateful and wondered why Mama never insisted that we do more for ourselves as we got older.  My sons are 2 and 5 yrs, respectively.  I have tried the clean up your room command, I have helped him clean his room and I will clean the room when I can&#39;t stand it, because they don&#39;t complain about the messiness.  But, at some point, I want my children to value having the ability to clean and to actually self-initiate cleaning.  Partly because of my experience as a child, but also because since having children, I have been disappointed that my husband does not feel moved to do more around the house considering that I have always done so much for the children.  Also, I see how my father-in-law is and I don&#39;t want sons who think that house work is beneath them.  I want them to understand that it is okay for men to clean because I want to them to do a better job of taking care of their wives when they get married and subsequently have children since that is something that is lacking in this culture.  And let me end with saying that I know that I am totally operating from my stuff, but laziness in men cleaning around the house seems to be pervasive.  I have not fully understood if it is nurture versus nature.  If nurturing can help, then I want sons who are at least open to doing housework.  At the very least I explain to my sons that I value a neat home so there are times when that is exactly what I am going to do in that moment.  That way they at least have the example of a person who values picking up around the house every now and again.  And while I am on a roll, I also feel that I have had to evolve into a person who knows how to clean.  Being a child who went to school and whose parents valued education, I feel that I was not taught the value in cleaning your home although as a child I remembered noting that my mother valued a clean home.  My parents emphasized academics and my personal interests outside the home.  But, as I have evolved spiritually throughout the years, I feel that my value in a clean home has more to do with the gratitude that I have for my home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis message is getting long and convoluted because I am trying to figure all of this out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWorking through my stuff.....<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mfhickman@...\">mfhickman@...</a> <br/>\n  To: unschooling basics <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, December 11, 2005 9:45 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Intro and question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hear you want to help her, so how do you go about helping her clean her room without getting angry?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I suggest you give her the gift of a clean room. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8245,"nextTopicId":8264}}
