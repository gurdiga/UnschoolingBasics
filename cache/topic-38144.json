She was<br/>\nbored (&quot;I know HOW to color! Why can&#39;t I do anything except<br/>\ncolor??!!&quot;) but I was really unsure about homeschooling or unschooling<br/>\nso we were going to keep her in until my middle child&#39;s &quot;issues&quot;<br/>\nstarted.  He was not due to start Kindergarten for over a year and was<br/>\nalready reading a ton and loved doing math and so on.  I started to<br/>\nreally worry, given my daughter&#39;s disgust with the curriculum in<br/>\nKindergarten that he was going to be bored and then that he would be<br/>\nlabeled a problem child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried getting him in to public school early thinking that might<br/>\nhelp (I believe now that it would have been just as horrible but at<br/>\nthe time it seemed a good idea) and the Principal at my daughter&#39;s<br/>\nschool told me that I should not try to get him in early because,<br/>\n&quot;Lots of people are holding their kids back, especially boys, because<br/>\nno one wants a geeky child.&quot;.  So after that I agreed to try<br/>\nhomeschooling as my husband had wanted to try for quite a while.  I<br/>\nagreed to give it a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started out more in the homeschooling camp but have gradually slid<br/>\ninto unschooling as working better for us.  I have been stunned how<br/>\nwell things have worked.  The kids are interested in everything and<br/>\nroutinely wow me with projects that they come up with all on their own.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the only difficulty you might have in showing your husband the<br/>\nwonder of unschooling would be that he doesn&#39;t have anything to<br/>\ncompare it to.  Not knowing where the kids would be if in school might<br/>\nmake it less obvious how great they will do at home.  Don&#39;t lose hope<br/>\nthough.  It&#39;s not nearly as hard as you are worried it might be.  I<br/>\nknow I worried the same things but have found that a lot of<br/>\nunschooling involves just seeing what they are interested in and going<br/>\nfrom there.  When you see it work, your husband will see too I bet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck,<br/>\nKristin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;aljonesz&quot; &lt;a.l.jonesz@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My DD is 4 and we live in the UK.
