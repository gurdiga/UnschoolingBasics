Yes, it scared me, but it didn&#39;t deter me.  If<br/>\nI grew up in these times instead of back then, I would have been on ritalin<br/>\nthrough most of my childhood.  I wasn&#39;t a BAD kid - I just was very easily<br/>\ndistracted.  My parents thought that they could use the fear of spankings to<br/>\nkeep me on track  For example, I was supposed to clean the living room<br/>\nbefore Dad got home from work.  What was supposed to happen was I would make<br/>\nthe decision to start cleaning to avoid the pain later on.  What happened<br/>\nwas that I would happily go along in my own little world until I heard the<br/>\ncar pulling into the driveway.  I would then make a DESPERATE attempt to<br/>\nshove things under furniture and, as Dad came in, start crying in<br/>\nanticipation of what I knew was going to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I also got spanked for things I didn&#39;t do.  My brother told a more<br/>\nconvincing story than I usually could - often I wasn&#39;t even aware of some of<br/>\nthe circumstances, so I never sounded convincing.  Usually the truth came<br/>\nout and my parents were always apologetic afterwards, but somehow that<br/>\nreally didn&#39;t make things better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know most people don&#39;t have these issues, but It is something I consider.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 12/12/05, Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I can remember being spanked once and it didn&#39;t make me afraid.
