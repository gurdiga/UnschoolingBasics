What we mean by that is parents who&#39;ve been alive longer and have more experience and more ideas about how to solve problems, etc., should be helping their kids do what they want and get what they want.   We don&#39;t mean a child should be a parents partner in managing adult responsibilities. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaking a child pay rent, making a little child feel responsible for what should be his parents responsibilities comes uncomfortably close to emotional incest.  A parent who makes a child feel that he is a partner in the responsibility of feeding and housing a family is making a terrible, terrible mistake. It&#39;s unhealthy.  Stop it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the checks are intended for the kids to use, give them the checks.  If the checks are intended for their care, cash the checks and use the portion you need and give them what&#39;s left for spending money.  Tell them something like, &quot;This is from the money your Dad sends to help take care of us.&quot; and let that be it  <br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone has to find a way to live with what they have.  Whether you have a one income family, SS checks, whether you&#39;re on Welfare, whether both parents work EVERYONE has to find a way to live with the money they have.  Limited income is not an excuse for the emotional abuse of children.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":189179665,"authorName":"wilda lahmann","from":"wilda lahmann &lt;freasabird2003@...&gt;","profile":"freasabird2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: not stopping","postDate":"1202790939","msgId":29663,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2ODQ3Ny4yMDg1My5xbUB3ZWI1MjgxMC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGZvcGloMCs3NDRxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":29659,"nextInTopic":29670,"prevInTime":29662,"nextInTime":29664,"topicId":29585,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Very well put, what I have been spending countless hours trying to put into words here.....my kiddos also receive checks from their deceased father....

My mom had never included my brother in I in the task of family finances.  I firmly believe in letting our kids know how much we pay out in bills and how much is left for fun.  So, I got 2 extra registers and printed some &quot;checks&quot;  out for them to use.  Whenever dh got paid we went to the bank made our deposit, then went home to write out the bills.  Jordan and Skylor recorded everything I did in their registers, they wrote out checks for all the same bills in the same amounts.  When we were done, they knew exactly how much was left for fun stuff.  This way they understand when I would have to say,we only have the money for so&so.  They knew I wasn&#39;t lying and knew when the extra money was there I would gladly spend it on them.  <br/>\nSusie<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: swissarmy_wife&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heatherbean@...\">heatherbean@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, February 10, 2008 7:19 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Paying Rent WAS: not stopping<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was thinking also that these are awfully big concepts for an 8 year<br/>\n  old to grasp.

Why?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, it sounds to me like your son was very upset that he had to<br/>\nleave.  Did you try and acknowledge his feelings about leaving?  I see<br/>\nthat you sign, but did you try to effectively communicate to him that<br/>\nyou understood upwhy he was set, and try and reach some sort of<br/>\nsolution.  Sometimes, when my kids are upset about leaving, all I have<br/>\nto do is acknowledge their feelings and empathize with them (gee I<br/>\nknow this really sucks, maybe next time we can stay longer).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Yesterday a situation came up with my oldest that has me concerned. I<br/>\n&gt; am not sure what he&#39;s thinking.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We went to the bank to get money deposited, etc. DS has a check every<br/>\n&gt; month for him to spend money on. He pays rent and has money left for<br/>\n&gt; what he wants. It is quite some change. At the bank I reminded him<br/>\n&gt; of the rent and the money he owed for the toy I got for him because he<br/>\n&gt; could not wait. (Lego Mars Mission set) He was upset (I would be too<br/>\n&gt; if I didn&#39;t understand how money shrinks), but he paid the amounts<br/>\n&gt; needed. He went over to the back of the room and played with the table<br/>\n&gt; set toys for kids. I was ready to go because one twin was hungry and<br/>\n&gt; wanted to eat. A gentle reminder to all... then I was left waiting at<br/>\n&gt; the door with one twin. I went back again to remind him and the other<br/>\n&gt; twin, but DS stayed while the rest of us stood at the door. We<br/>\n&gt; FINALLY got to the van but DS lagged back, pushing at the handicapped<br/>\n&gt; door button. I went back once again but he refused to look at me or<br/>\n&gt; stop pushing at the button. I had to push him away gently to look at<br/>\n&gt; me (remember we depend on eye contact to sign and communicate) and get<br/>\n&gt; him to stop pushing the button.
