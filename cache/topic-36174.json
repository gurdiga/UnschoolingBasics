Should the case ever arise that (God forbid)<br/>\nI&#39;m no longer around, I want her to be able to take up learning under<br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s tutelage or a school (again, God forbid) without too<br/>\nmuch grief. This is the one area I know she might lack otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know many of you will have your opinions on this and I welcome<br/>\nthem. I&#39;d like to fully unschool her, but I also need to resolve it<br/>\nwith my life&#39;s circumstances.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt must be scary to imagine your children growing up without you. There <br/>\nare<br/>\npeople on this list who have lost family members. I bet you every one <br/>\nof them is<br/>\nhappier for the memories they have of an unschooled life filled with <br/>\njoy and<br/>\nlaughter and presence and play than they worry about anything that they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t<br/>\nteach or learn in those precious moments. I imagine that your daughters <br/>\nwill<br/>\nrather that they remember you as this wonderfully joyful parent than <br/>\nthat they<br/>\nwill rally against you for not preparing them well enough for a <br/>\npossible return<br/>\nto school. Parent them with the wonderful freedom that could come with <br/>\nknowing<br/>\nthat every moment is a gift. Don&#39;t prepare them for your absence, let <br/>\nthem live<br/>\nwith your joy!<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36170,"nextTopicId":36009}}
