I&#39;ve heard both over the years. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also the case that there are &quot;issues&quot; which are only issues with a kid in school. At home, there&#39;s no rush for a kid to be able to perform the sorts of tasks kids &quot;have to do&quot; at specific ages in school. You have time to help your child find lifetime solutions to problems she would otherwise have to wait until eighteen to learn - or a series of &quot;right now&quot; solutions until she&#39;s ready for something else. In that sense, unschooling can be Better for kids who don&#39;t fit in the typical mold. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Also woundering if they would start stuff with DSS.

Be confident in yourself and your family. In fact, it&#39;s worth contacting child services proactively in your situation to find out if there are any services They can hook you up with. They might know a good OT who works outside of the school system, for instance. Treat child services as potentially helpful service professionals rather than scary ogres and it will make any interactions you might have much much better. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] unschooling /schooling with a labbeled child","postDate":"1320140884","msgId":47630,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE1MTM1RTk3LTcwNjMtNEUzMC04RkMxLTBDNUY5NjFCQ0U3MUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo4bDA0NCtuNWhhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo4bDA0NCtuNWhhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47629,"nextInTopic":47632,"prevInTime":47629,"nextInTime":47631,"topicId":47627,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

From their point of view,  <br/>\nsuccess in school is success in life. Failing in school -- dropping  <br/>\nout -- means (to them) failing at life. And likely they&#39;re right in  <br/>\ntheir world because kids who drop out often believe that&#39;s true also.  <br/>\nSo the kids often don&#39;t try to succeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you told most teachers about unschooling, they would think that&#39;s  <br/>\nappalling and a quick road to life in a cardboard box under an  <br/>\noverpass.
