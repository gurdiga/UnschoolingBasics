So I&#39;ve been giving  myself,and her, <br/>\ntime to adjust. I realize now that I need to trust my own  instincts. I know <br/>\nwhat is right for me and my daughter and it&#39;s great to know  that others share <br/>\nthe same views. I too am amazed at how conditioned I am by the  educational <br/>\nsystem.
