They are like family to us and our children miss each<br/>\nother terribly. The challenge? B is not wanting to fly alone, even<br/>\nthough his Mom can send him up!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were writing today she said something about &quot;I&#39;m going to go<br/>\nmainstream on him and tell him to get his butt on that<br/>\nplane!&quot;...completely joking of course BUT it seems so much easier to us!<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving people just do what I say sounds lovely at times...no matter<br/>\ntheir age.:)  It doesn&#39;t respect their preferences or build healthy<br/>\nrelationships though. In the case of B flying up here, we are looking<br/>\nat meeting in another city to get him, his Mom driving him up, renting<br/>\na vehicle etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, we are providing a framework of options. The child is as<br/>\nmuch a part of the decision making process as the parents. It&#39;s a lot<br/>\nmore EFFORT this way...YES. It could be a big old NO. It&#39;s not.

Just discussing it can<br/>\nhelp us see new options we didn&#39;t see before. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal isn&#39;t a constant stream of &quot;yes&quot; that leaves anyone feeling<br/>\nstressed and tired.

So it makes sense that our list leans<br/>\nto the side of blunt, like us.:) We DO however, realize that a lot of<br/>\npeople are new to RU ideas and accept the fact that we (and many other<br/>\nposters here which we are eternally grateful to for their time) will<br/>\nanswer the same tv/chores/food questions over and over and over<br/>\nagain.That&#39;s just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s &quot;basics&quot; because we&#39;re encouraging people to look beyond<br/>\neducation and see how to apply these principles to ALL of life. Just<br/>\nas it says in the description. If a person is uncomfortable with that,<br/>\nthat&#39;s their business and their journey. We aren&#39;t here to convert<br/>\nanyone, but we WILL question those that have decided it can&#39;t work for<br/>\none reason or another. Because we are living it and KNOW it can work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very patient overall, with anyone that wants to question or even<br/>\ndisagree. Where I get a bit cranky, is when someone gets on a list<br/>\nthat has a clear description and starts disrespectfully lambasting<br/>\neveryone on the list for being &quot;unparents&quot; or telling RU members that<br/>\nthey are &quot;nuts&quot; or their kids will be &quot;hellions&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if people are on the sensitive side, blunt questions might feel<br/>\nuncomfortable and they may like a list like another more &quot;support&quot;<br/>\nbased list better.

Nobody is being chained<br/>\nhere and forced to stay if they don&#39;t like it. I think it&#39;s pretty<br/>\npresumptuous to ask a list to change to suit each person, rather than<br/>\nsimply finding a list that works for you or creating one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list was started for exactly that reason! We didn&#39;t like the way<br/>\na list was run, so we started our own.

And that is often what<br/>\nis suggested many modern books on parenting these days. It&#39;s a great approach. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I&#39;ve noticed in many of the posts here:  people are busy vigorously upholding the RU ideal that they&#39;re claiming they set few limits on their children.  Bu there&#39;s a trust/wisdom conundrum.  Obviously no one here would give a 2 year old welding gear limit-free.  But RU parents are more likely to let the small ones try welding  with  a LOT of limits placed on the activity until they&#39;re proven to have some level of wisdom about the dangers involved.  That&#39;s also why I (prepare yourself for RU heresy here) limit the amount of time my kids watch TV and playcomputer games. *gasp*  Obviously there&#39;s a whole different level of danger tv to acetylene torches, but no less serious in my mind.  Perhaps your kids were born inherently balanced and wise, but mine will do nothing but play RuneScape all day if it&#39;s allowed, (and sometimes it is).  I think RuneScape is a very valuable activity.  So is dancing, and cleaning your room, and reading a book, and climbing trees and hanging out with your family...all of those things are limited here, though I frankly don&#39;t have to set too many limits on excessive room-cleaning!<br/>\n<br/>\nThing is, we can argue all day about whether TV has any inherent worth (yes & no--it&#39;s a tool, depends on how you use it) and whether limiting use of video games makes me a bad RU mommy, but I see my job as helping my children to acquire wisdom, and the way we&#39;ve chosen to do so is by making &quot;all things in moderation&quot; our mantra.  You may choose to help your children aquire wisdom in a different way.  I get the feeling many of you teach wisdom the &quot;sink or swim&#39; way in which you let your kids immerse themselves in whatever impulse they have at any given moment.  Which could be very empowering for the kid and I hope it works out for anyone who does that.  I believe that my kids would suffer a lot of sinking that I can easily prevent by simply requiring them to aim for balance.  It&#39;s funny, I read the link given by Paul the suburban turmoil lady (who was an imbecile, mostly) but she had a point about the freedom from TV addiction her mom gave her when she was 8.  No one likes to be told &quot;no you can&#39;t do this thing you enjoy all day, do something else&quot;, but it&#39;s something I believe is necessary for kids--my kids anyway, I can&#39;t presume to know what&#39;s best for yours. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd some adults probably--me being one of them!--could be told the same thing.  The difference is that I&#39;ve learned to deal with my impulse control (sort of) and my kids haven&#39;t.  They see something they want this second, and everything else falls away, including the bigger picture things they want (i.e that kid refusing swim class to stay with cousins could be my daughter--who will sometimes claim not to want to go to dance class when she&#39;s immersed in something else--but in fact dance class is her passion and once she&#39;s there she&#39;s very glad of it.  You may think I&#39;m interpreting this wrongly, but it&#39;s true--she sometimes doesn&#39;t know what she really wants--she just knows her immediate desires.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThus the idea of letting your child&#39;s short-term desires supercede other desires in the name of freedom is not really helping, is it?  You can go back and ask &quot;When you kept playing outside and refused to go to dance class, did you regret it later?&quot; and sometimes that&#39;s great.  Or you can support your kid a little more and talk in depth before the decision of whether to go or not, to play video games or go for a walk, or whatever balanced decision needs to be made--and that&#39;s even better.  We do that all the time with 2 of our kids and it works great.  Somethimes they make a choice I wouldn&#39;t make, but then, I&#39;m not them.  But my 12yo daughter can rarely see past immediate gratification--and she&#39;s the kid needs to be pulled away from one thing, complaining bitterly the while, so she can do something else she actually wants more.  She&#39;s the cut-off-her-nose-to-spite-her-face kind of stubborn.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I see freedom for our kids not in absolute &quot;you do whatever you want whenever you want it&quot;, but rather in &quot;you make most of the choices about your life, but sometimes I&#39;m going to act on my extra years and expericen and make a choice that you can&#39;t see from where you&#39;re at&quot;.  If I&#39;m wrong about a choice I make, I say sorry.  But if I think my kids are in danger of losing a scrap of their soul I intervene.  Example: I was nearly in tears reading about the kid suffering social problems related to his airgun impulse-control problems and I wanted to scream &quot;take the gun away!&quot;  The kid can&#39;t deal with it right now, he needs to acquire more social skills before he should be shooting at people.  I see absolute freedom is the worst sort of disservice in this case.  Lots of limits need to be placed on that kid&#39;s use of guns until he can see that what he wants more than shooting people is enjoying his social interactions.  He&#39;s too young to see that bigger picture--it&#39;s up to his parents to do so.  At least that&#39;s what I see from over here.  Who knows how it feels over there, in his family?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo--long post, huh?  I have lots to say.  I have a feeling I&#39;m going to be reamed out for my controlling tendencies.  That&#39;s not such a good sign about the comfort level for newbies on the list, you know. I&#39;ve lurked for a couple of weeks and realized that reaming out is fairly common in this list.  I&#39;m Ok with it , though.  I can take it because I have confidence that I&#39;m doing the right thing for my family in terms of balance and choice.  (Perhaps others weren&#39;t so comfortable and that&#39;s why they slammed you on another list.) But as a 14 year veteran of unschooling--extremely radical in that until last year we never did much &quot;school&quot; at all (and last year was an experiment--failed, by the way) I feel that a few of the people on this list have the idea that there&#39;s only one way to live an RU life--their way.  I thought maybe they were new converts and like all new converts had a passionate ideal for &quot;purity&quot;.  Darn that whole purity thing--life messes it up every time!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly, Shannon<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve been making a list of the things they don&#39;t teach you at school. They don&#39;t teach you how to love somebody. They don&#39;t teach you how to be famous. They don&#39;t teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don&#39;t teach you how to walk away from someone you don&#39;t love any longer. They don&#39;t teach you how to know what&#39;s going on in someone else&#39;s mind. They don&#39;t teach you what to say to someone who&#39;s dying.

And in general, almost all unschooling parents are spending<br/>\na lot more time with their kids and spending a lot more intellectual and<br/>\nemotional effort trying to reach good decisions with and for kids -- the<br/>\ncomplete opposite of an effortless dumping of kids into the day-prison<br/>\ncalled school 7am-3pm weekdays. If people can&#39;t see that after reading this<br/>\nlist, obviously they just don&#39;t want to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, beyond what I saw as negative comments directed to Maura&#39;s writings,<br/>\nand then further defenses of those when Maura pointed that out, it seems<br/>\nthat assumptions were made as to her background (or mine for that matter). I<br/>\nthink Maura rightly called some people on it (and as she says elsewhere,<br/>\nshe&#39;s not the person posting about that in another list anyway). Such<br/>\ncomments are understandable on this list given its history and also some<br/>\nunschoolers maybe feeling sometimes perhaps in a threatened minority (as the<br/>\nabove quoted comment from another list shows), but it still doesn&#39;t make it<br/>\nfeel that friendly. I&#39;m not saying it should or should not feel friendly,<br/>\nI&#39;m just pointing out why for many newcomers it might not seem friendly --<br/>\nrelated to assumptions. Once might expect people coming to the list to have<br/>\nmistaken assumptions (after all they are new) but one might hope old hands<br/>\non a list might make less assumptions of newcomers. Look again at Maura&#39;s<br/>\nsituation -- a long time homeschooler and self-labeled unschooler, almost<br/>\nsinglehandedly managing a block of kids sometimes. There is a lot to respect<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she (or I) certainly aren&#39;t making &quot;snarky&quot; comments like, say, here:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://suburbanturmoil.blogspot.com/2006/11/unschooling-updated.html\">http://suburbanturmoil.blogspot.com/2006/11/unschooling-updated.html</a><br/>\nbut the response somehow feels seems more in line as if we had. (There&#39;s<br/>\nsome good defense of unschooling there in the comments too, by the way.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own case, I agree very much with the unschooling approach and have for<br/>\nyears -- I just happen to think TV is more insidiously dangerous than most<br/>\npeople here feel it is (especially for young children whose brains are<br/>\neither still growing rapidly or who have trouble distinguishing between<br/>\nfantasy and reality -- but also to a lesser degree for other ages, including<br/>\nparents. :-) Obviously most (but not all) people currently on this list<br/>\ndisagree with this assessment of risk versus reward and think TV an overall<br/>\npositive, especially as managed in unschooling families. So, it&#39;s not the<br/>\nunschooling philosophy I disagree with, it&#39;s the assessment of risk/reward<br/>\nfor one particular (large) aspect of modern life (TV) for our family at this<br/>\nparticular time. Other people make other decisions in what cars they feel<br/>\ndrive with their kids, where they live with their kids, whether or when to<br/>\ngive kids guns or fireworks or knives, and so on. Still, even without a<br/>\nhooked-up TV which I still consider too dangerous to use right now for a<br/>\nyoung child, we live in a place with dangerous packs of coyotes and<br/>\npotentially troublesome bears and hard-to-see bobcats that will drop out of<br/>\nthe trees on their prey (young kids?) -- so we just have a different view of<br/>\nrisk/reward. Our dogs help minimize those risks somewhat, as does a fence,<br/>\nas does parental vigilance -- just as there are several ways many<br/>\nunschoolers attempt to minimize risk for TV watching. No doubt some person<br/>\nhere might think where we live is too dangerous a place for a young child<br/>\nand not worth the benefits, even as I think a TV in the living room is too<br/>\ndangerous for a young child and not worth the benefits. In the case of TV, I<br/>\nresponded directly to a question of my views of TV. This isn&#39;t to reopen the<br/>\nTV argument, just to point out where I am coming from related to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to contemplate why other people (maybe not that specific quoted<br/>\nposter) might look at this list so differently relative to how the people on<br/>\nit feel about it, I think some of the questions and comments Maura posted<br/>\nabout real situations and their implications indirectly show why people<br/>\nmight consider unschooling as depicted on this list as sometimes<br/>\nquestionable (and if not &quot;cookie cuter&quot; than some unschooling version of an<br/>\nunrealistic &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; with the child obviously playing a starring<br/>\nrole. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, consider Maura&#39;s pointing out the impracticality of rounding up<br/>\nthe neighbors&#39; kids to go to a paint ball park. Also, consider the seeming<br/>\nnon-acceptance by some people here that such an alternative solution of<br/>\nplaying in a paintball park at well defined times and with proper safety<br/>\nequipment and well-defined ground rules (like only willing participants get<br/>\nshot at) -- even if accepted by the child -- was still essentially a &quot;no&quot; in<br/>\nrelation to what her son really wanted to do right then and there of run<br/>\nwild with an airgun and friends. There are a lot of potentially dangerous<br/>\nthings in our society that are often managed as staged processes of learning<br/>\nand proving increasing trustworthiness over a period of time -- martial<br/>\narts, learning to fly, learning to drive, practicing emergency medicine,<br/>\nbeing a wilderness guide, and so on. I think the lack of great answers to<br/>\nthis specific issue and Maura&#39;s rebuttals on it shows a weakness in an<br/>\noverly broad *philosophical* position of maximum freedom for the child to<br/>\nchose their own activities which many here seem to maintain (even as their<br/>\nexcellent *practice* of unschooling seems fantastic). There is a big hole,<br/>\nwhich Maura points out, related to incremental trust -- to earning trust to<br/>\nwork with ever greater resources or ever more dangerous resources, and to<br/>\nexplain that process to the child (Note: it is somewhat similar to the<br/>\nprocess of earning incremental powers in video games as kids level up after<br/>\nhard work. :-). And that tension between theory and practice is then<br/>\ndisturbing to many who are not on this list (as well as a few on it).<br/>\n<br/>\nEssentially, in practice, rather than say &quot;no&quot;, most unschoolers according<br/>\nto what people here say usually try very hard to find a way to say &quot;yes&quot; to<br/>\nat least part of a request (given their level of trust in the child&#39;s<br/>\ncurrent abilities and decision making skills related to the activity).<br/>\nOften, that is enough to satisfy a kid. But, as I see it, and as many others<br/>\nsee it, that is still saying &quot;no&quot; or &quot;setting limits&quot; -- even if the limits<br/>\nare not spelled out in hard and fast rules. A pattern repeated here again<br/>\nand again as a suggested approach to a child&#39;s request beyond some implicit<br/>\ninternal (often unacknowledged) parental limit of trust or resources is<br/>\nessentially often a variant of: &quot;(implicit no) -- here is why -- and how<br/>\nabout a related idea as a compromise distraction?&quot; So, the response to an<br/>\nunacceptable request which goes beyond an implicit parental limit is<br/>\nessentially a refusal (even if the word &quot;no&quot; is not used), then an<br/>\nexplanation (or dialog), and a compromise substitute. And that is often what<br/>\nis suggested many modern books on parenting these days. It&#39;s a great<br/>\napproach. And I see nothing wrong with that from a practical point of view.<br/>\nAnd many people here seem to have taken that idea to a wonderful and<br/>\ncreative extreme with good results reported. But, I and others do find it<br/>\nproblematical when it seems like unschoolers are trying to claim they don&#39;t<br/>\nset limits or say &quot;no&quot; -- when it seems obvious they do, just in a generally<br/>\nmore humane and creative way.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some people, living in a world of implicit limits may even seem<br/>\nworse than living in a world of explicit limits -- since you never know as a<br/>\nkid when you will get a &quot;discussion&quot; or &quot;frown&quot; (punishments from some kids&#39;<br/>\npoint of view?) for breaking an implicit rule or passing an invisible fence<br/>\nyou never knew was there. It&#39;s not at all the same situation, but to show<br/>\nhow there can be unintended consequences to everything, John Holt writes in<br/>\none of his books how the most terrified kids he ever taught were actually<br/>\nones from an upper middle class school which focused on constant praise, and<br/>\nhe said the kids essentially lived in terror of not being praised. He<br/>\nsuggested in that case the very real fear they felt was greater than if the<br/>\nschool has just disciplined the kids severely for any wrong answer. Related<br/>\nlink:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alfiekohn.org/parenting/gj.htm\">http://www.alfiekohn.org/parenting/gj.htm</a><br/>\nNow, I&#39;m not suggesting unschooling kids live in terror or that they get too<br/>\nmuch praise -- this is just an analogy to unintended consequences of<br/>\nanything, even a lot of choices, that seems like a good thing. [Actually,<br/>\neven having a lot of choices can be its own sort of tyranny, see:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alternet.org/story/18390\">http://www.alternet.org/story/18390</a> ]<br/>\nBut, I would suggest for some kids, in some situations, having clear<br/>\nboundaries may be better and promote more creativity within them than having<br/>\nvague ones which must always be wondered about as a cause of stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most mainstream parents would have less problems with unschooling<br/>\n(even radical unschooling or even &quot;unparenting&quot;) presented as &quot;we supervise<br/>\nand interact with our younger kids a lot, and we try to refuse as little as<br/>\npossible, and when we do set limits, we try to do that as humanely as<br/>\npossible, explaining as much a possible, and and with as much compromise as<br/>\nwe (the parents) feel is reasonable in order to support as much of the<br/>\noriginal intent of the child as possible, considering the needs and<br/>\nlimitations of everyone in the family. It takes a lot of time and energy,<br/>\nmuch more so than mainstream parenting in many ways. We do this because<br/>\n(pick one or more of) we believe practicing using judgment results in<br/>\ndeveloping judgment, or we believe in the value of childhood in its own<br/>\nright, or we believe freedom is its own value, or we believe whatever else.<br/>\nI think that is somehow a more complete expression of it -- including that<br/>\nit takes a lot of hard work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an analogy, consider nursing. So much pro-nursing literature tries to<br/>\nmake it look easy and &quot;natural&quot; in order to encourage new mothers to try it,<br/>\nand also as there is an aspect of self-fulfilling prophecy there. But then<br/>\nwhen it is hard (as it often is, as our society has lost the<br/>\ninter-generational handing down of technique and confidence in part due to<br/>\n1950s doctoring), and as problems arise, it&#39;s easy for new mothers to just<br/>\nquit out of frustration, or even just blame themselves -- as in, if it is so<br/>\neasy and natural, what is wrong with me that it is so hard or takes so much<br/>\ntime and attention? Perhaps it&#39;s better for unschoolers, as perhaps with<br/>\nnursing, to say up front -- this is often very hard in terms of parental<br/>\ntime and effort, but it is worth it for all these benefits (X, Y, and Z), so<br/>\nit is a great long term investment for you and your kids if you can afford<br/>\nit right now.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I feel (from an outside point of view) there is a confusion between<br/>\nobviously working *technique* (of family-oriented compromise, sometimes<br/>\nlabeled &quot;unschooling&quot;) and seemingly implausible *theory* (of complete<br/>\nindividual freedom, as if there were no current limits just because they are<br/>\nnot spelled out in advance) as it is seems to be presented here sometimes.<br/>\nNot surprisingly, differences between practice and theory happens all the<br/>\ntime in engineering and science. The engineers (like the people on this<br/>\nlist) come up with a way to do something the scientists (mainstream parents<br/>\nand mainstream educators?) with all their theories say is impossible (like<br/>\nperhaps to someday travel faster than light, or perhaps to let older<br/>\nunschooled kids have unlimited access to TV or Video Games :-) and then,<br/>\neventually, the scientists revise the theory, and change it to fit the facts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an analogy, in some towns in the Netherlands that have removed all<br/>\ntraffic signs and lights and speed bumps and find traffic fatalities go down<br/>\n-- and the theory is something like that drivers become more cautious around<br/>\npedestrians when they don&#39;t have obvious traffic signals.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list represents facts as to successful practice in many families, but I<br/>\nthink for various reasons it sometimes lacks a good way of articulating a<br/>\ngood enough theoretical framework to newcomers to explain why the practices<br/>\nwork (in practice) as well as they do -- as opposed to why they should not<br/>\nwork in theory according to some theories -- either mainstream or ones<br/>\nfloated here.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--Paul Fernhout</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7644358,"authorName":"Kidgie@aol.com","from":"Kidgie@...","profile":"mama_de_julian_y_julia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Snarky comments","postDate":"1185908524","msgId":25367,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJmOS4xY2Y4M2IwOS4zM2UwZTEyY0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25366,"nextInTopic":25369,"prevInTime":25366,"nextInTime":25368,"topicId":25329,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/31/2007 11:11:22 A.M.

They<br/>\n&gt; have seen things<br/>\n&gt; on the internet that made them uncomfortable and<br/>\n&gt; they came to me and<br/>\n&gt; told me.

I am still<br/>\nlearning, and you all have been a tremendous help.  I<br/>\nknow everyone has a difference of opinions, but isn&#39;t<br/>\nthat what makes us individuals?  You all have helped<br/>\nme think in ways that I never would have, if I hadn&#39;t<br/>\npulled my kids out of public schools.  What was the<br/>\nnormal thing there, is no longer normal in my house. <br/>\nIt is really fun to just relax, and throw all of the<br/>\ntime lines out the window, with no more book reports,<br/>\netc, and no certain time we have to be anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to apologize to you, and to everyone else for<br/>\nany of the times I took advice wrong, and didn&#39;t take<br/>\nthe time to really listen.

The owner there<br/>\nassumes that she  is the only one who is right and if she doesn&#39;t like<br/>\nwhat you have to say will jump all over you and then put you on<br/>\nmoderated posts, or delete what you have to say because it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t &quot;fit&quot; into her way of thinking. She does nothing but push<br/>\nfreedom and free speech, etc. yet she finds it okay to moderate people<br/>\nor delete what they have to say. That makes no sense. Today&#39;s<br/>\nhighlights were mainly about how it is fine for your kid to view pono<br/>\nmovies, including hardcore, if they choose to. Most of the main<br/>\ncontributors of posts love to jump on anyone that shows any signs of<br/>\nactually being a parent to their children, and looking out for them.&quot;~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s too bad that the person chose to warn people away from a<br/>\nlist that others might find helpful. To each their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure who they think the &quot;owner&quot; is since there are two of us<br/>\nand two moderators.  The posts that were deleted were religious in<br/>\nnature and/or extremely inflammatory and not about unschooling.<br/>\nYep, we&#39;re censorship happy.;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI care deeply about &quot;looking out&quot; for my children and I think it&#39;s<br/>\napparent by all the posts here that we are all very connected parents<br/>\nthat place our relationships with our children as a high priority in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.....I brought this here as a point of discussion. With all the<br/>\nintense discussions about assisting our children without coercion and<br/>\ncontrol, how does it boil down to someone hearing &quot;Porno is fine&quot; and<br/>\nmissing the entire point????<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25514,"nextTopicId":24803}}
