Not my cup of<br/>\ntea, but Dakari isn&#39;t hurting anyone, and it brings him joy.***<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a long time, when Dylan was younger he was Mrs. Quarks and he wore a<br/>\nstring shopping bag on his head like a hair net, tied in the back like a<br/>\npony tail.  He wore it everywhere.  Sometimes he&#39;d wear his green afghan<br/>\npinned round his neck for a cape.  But Mrs. Quarks was with us for a very<br/>\nlong time and she always wore the shopping bag.  &lt;g&gt;   She suffered from<br/>\na disease called Kirksagerkus and so would announce sometimes, loudly, in<br/>\nthe store or Post Office (where it echoed)  &quot;I can feel it, the end is<br/>\nnear!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe would wrap a stuffed animal or six up in his baby quilt and sometime<br/>\nthe afghan too (if it wasn&#39;t round his neck) and carry it with him.  It<br/>\nwas his &quot;bundle of snuggles.&quot;   He was nine, I think before he stopped<br/>\ntaking it into stores and he still slept with it until he was eleven or<br/>\ntwelve. <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan tucked his pant legs into his socks and it bugged dh David.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know why, I guess he thought people would think less of him if his<br/>\nkid was weird. &lt;g&gt;  He did that until he was about eight or nine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan wore his clothes inside out because he hated the feel of the seems<br/>\nand tags.  I think he did that until he was eight or so.  Then, gradually<br/>\nhe got used to the seems.  Tags still bother him so we buy tagless or cut<br/>\nthem out.  Tags bug dh too. <br/>\n<br/>\nHis favorite game was a game of imagination that he played out in his<br/>\nhead while pacing back and forth on the front lawn, holding a strand of<br/>\nhis long hair and wiggling it violently while he made explosion noises<br/>\n(you know the kind of spitty, phkhh! noise?)  He paced all the grass away<br/>\nand there is still a divot by the front door where he would land after<br/>\njumping from the top step.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could show your husband this post and then Dakari&#39;s book bag<br/>\nwill seem perfectly ok to him!   Sometimes I think we project our kids<br/>\ninto the future as they are now, but they will be different people in ten<br/>\nyears, in twenty.  They will want different things for themselves.  They<br/>\nwill move on from where they are today, like all of us will. <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan will be fourteen in two and a half weeks.  He carries a pocket<br/>\nknife and wallet now instead of his bundle of snuggles.  He wears funky<br/>\nhemp hats sometimes instead of string shopping bags and capes.   All his<br/>\nclothes are worn right side out and most of them make some kind of<br/>\npolitical statement.

And if you think MY statements weren&#39;t unschooly enough, then you&#39;ll cringe at his.  For example: Dakari loves to carry his bookbag wherever he goes.  Not my cup of tea, but Dakari isn&#39;t hurting anyone, and it brings him joy.  My husband did not like it at all.  I told him it&#39;s normal and lots of kids carry something around with them all the time.  One day he may grow out of it, or maybe not.  I asked him why he carries it around, he said it makes him feel like he&#39;s going to school (my kids were in school for 5 months this year).  Maybe it&#39;s a sense of stability, maybe it&#39;s just fun for him....whatever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m working on more hugs for everyone in my house.  Hugs are therapeutic.
