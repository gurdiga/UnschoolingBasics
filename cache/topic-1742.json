They see &#39;us&#39; talk to <br/>\nstrangers all the time so that&#39;s confusing, because really, &#39;most&#39; strangers <br/>\naren&#39;t dangerous :)  It IS more about children learning to follow their instincts <br/>\nand trusting their intuition about strangers AND people they know. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think someone else here recently recommended the book, Protecting The Gift, <br/>\nand I can&#39;t agree more.  The author, Gavin De Becker (I think?) gives some <br/>\nextremely helpful advice and suggestions.  He cleared up some huge <br/>\nmisconceptions I had.  The book is not dry or boring at all, in fact it reads more like a <br/>\nthriller, but it was extremely empowering for me!!!  Check it out...I&#39;m sure <br/>\nyour library has a copy.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Denise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1564,"nextTopicId":1480}}
