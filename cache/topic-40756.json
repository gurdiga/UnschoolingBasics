She is interested in starting a club with other kids with a similar interest.  We live in Acworth and would love to actually get together if possible.  However, if we live too far apart, please contact me anyway if your child would be interested in emailing with my daughter.  Feel free to email me personally.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nAshlee</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40739,"nextTopicId":40742}}
