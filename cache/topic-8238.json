He surfs, works, skis, does anything he wants. He lives in Brazil but has lived in the US for a couple of years. He reads and writes. He did his best when he had private tutoring than when he went to school. ( His family does not even know what homeschooling is).He has many friens that are not special needs and lots that are. He has made most of his friend thryu his parents and siblings and activites that he wanted to join in. THey treat him like a normal person that has the same values and wants and needs as anybody in the family. THey are not a perfect family at all but thye try to be the best for him. THe parents are divorced and his mom has re-married and hes new husband is great to him.<br/>\nHe actually adopted him just so he could leave his military pension to him when he dies. Everyone agreed to it including his kids that will not get the good pension.<br/>\nWell what i got to say is that my cousin did better at home than in school eeeven thou school was OK. He has made friends out of school and not really in school.<br/>\nHope it helps.<br/>\nAlex<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: leavingemeraldcity <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, December 12, 2005 12:02 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Tough Questions... Any answers?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This may be a shot in the dark, but you never know...<br/>\n  My husband and I are agonizing over a decision we need to make soon<br/>\n  regarding our third child, who has Down Syndrome. We have homeschooled<br/>\n  from the start, have now moved to unschooling, and we are being<br/>\n  encouraged to place our son in kindergarten next fall. He is 5 1/2 now<br/>\n  and has no speech, as hearing has been an issue all along, and he<br/>\n  could only have tubes inserted in his ears in September. The thought<br/>\n  is that with more interaction with his peers, more one-on-one help,<br/>\n  his language abilities may develop faster. I&#39;m not so sure about that,<br/>\n  but for me its a question of him being known and accepted in our <br/>\n  small town. Our other children are sociable and arrange their own<br/>\n  interaction with friends outside of school. I&#39;m not sure he&#39;ll have a<br/>\n  circle of friends and be accepted in the community if he stays home<br/>\n  with the others. Also, as a parent there&#39;s all the second-guessing,<br/>\n  feeling insecure in unknown territory and all the anxieties that go<br/>\n  with having a &quot;special needs&quot; child.  Yet I grieve over the thought of<br/>\n  sending him &quot;out&quot; to school when the others stay home, over the<br/>\n  possibility of him losing the closeness with his siblings, being less<br/>\n  a part of what goes on here. At the same time I recognize that perhaps<br/>\n  I can&#39;t give him everything he needs. We&#39;ve also been told his<br/>\n  therapies will stop once he is &quot;school age,&quot; because then they must be<br/>\n  accessed through the school system. So we also feel boxed into a<br/>\n  corner. I tell myself that Kindergarten is only half-time, and that<br/>\n  even if we send him we can always pull him out.
