It really is a better way. Won&#39;t it be nice to be delighted with your son instead of frustrated? :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;My biggest question is what do you do all day?

It&#39;s too broad. I ask them what&#39;s on the agenda for the day or what they&#39;d *like* to do or if they want to join me in doing something. Our structure is more of a rhythym to our days. We get up, eat, read our email, etc. Our mornings are usually quiet and separate. We read, watch TV, write, take care of personal stuff, do our own projects. Our afternoons are more for together time. That&#39;s when we go out, see movies, check out a museum, visit new places or see friends. It&#39;s not like that everyday. We also do together stuff at home in the mornings or stay home all day in our jammies too. Our days flow and we go with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;If one says she interested in veterinarians, where do I go from<br/>\n </span></blockquote>there...besides the library or PetSmart?  If one says he likes GI<br/>\nJoe...where do I go from there?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGo where they want to go and no further. For the veterinarian interest I&#39;d be inclined to make animals a  part of our lives. Maybe get some pets, volunteer at the shelter, watch Animal Planet, go to the zoo, talk to the vet about their work, check out fun books, rent some animal movies. For GI Joe...I&#39;d get some GI Joes of course. Maybe that will spark an interest in history or costuming or firearms or something. Be interested with him and see what he&#39;s liking about it. But I wouldn&#39;t push, I&#39;d enjoy the play.
