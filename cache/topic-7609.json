Someone over <br/>\nthere was just sharing a &quot;day in their unschooly life&quot; and I thought <br/>\nit would be fun to keep a file of those stories, and maybe, just maybe <br/>\neventually turn it into some kind of a book.  I love reading those <br/>\nstories, as I am sure most of you do too so share your stories, either <br/>\nhere or e-mail me off list and I will keep them in a file.  They are <br/>\nvery inspirational and remind us all of why we choose to live this <br/>\nlifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7605,"nextTopicId":7494}}
