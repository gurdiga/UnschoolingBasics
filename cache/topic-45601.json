When we started taking<br/>\nover the chores my partner and I both had moments of &quot;why are we doing<br/>\neverything now&quot; but for the most part between her and I one of us was<br/>\nalways willing to joyfully take on a task and complete it.  We still<br/>\nasked him for help with stuff but quite often reminded him that he<br/>\ncould say no, or ask us to wait until he was in a place that he could<br/>\nsave his game.  Sometimes he helped with a bad attitude, sometimes he<br/>\nhelped cheerfully, sometimes he said no.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few weeks ago we let Draven get a kitten, but that kitten was lonely<br/>\nbecause our older cats didn&#39;t want anything to do with him, so my<br/>\npartner picked out a kitten, then I felt left out and I picked out a<br/>\nkitten.  We now have a total of 5 cats in the house.  This means 2<br/>\nlitter boxes that have to be scooped at the very least once a day, but<br/>\nwe try to get it twice a day.  My partner has always had a problem<br/>\nwith the litter box (she gets physically ill) so typically I took care<br/>\nof it, with the occasional help from Draven.  This past 2 weeks though<br/>\nthings have worked out incredibly well.  Draven and I kind of got into<br/>\na routine of switching off days, however I did it 3 or 4 days in a row<br/>\nonce and he noticed and offered to do it the next 2 days in a row.<br/>\nLast night he asked if I would do it and instead my partner said she<br/>\nwould try.  She had a really hard time with it and it was so sweet<br/>\nthat Draven was the first one to say &quot;Ma, you don&#39;t have to make<br/>\nyourself sick, I&#39;ll finish it&quot;  and she said no, she wanted to do it.<br/>\nThen I chimed in and said to please let me do it.  She again said no.<br/>\nThen Draven went into the hallway and held the bag for her to make it<br/>\na little easier, and then took it out to the dumpster.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother really cool moment was a few nights ago.  I had gotten into a<br/>\ncleaning mood and attacked the kitchen with a vengeance.  As I said in<br/>\nanother post, we&#39;re fighting bugs so while I was deep cleaning<br/>\neverything I was spraying bug killer into every crack and crevice I<br/>\ncould find.  It took me hours and after I was done the top half I was<br/>\njust exhausted.  Draven came in to check on me and asked if he could<br/>\nhelp.  I mentioned that it would be a huge help if he could wipe the<br/>\nspots off of the bottom cabinets.  Well he started on the cabinets,<br/>\nthen asked if he could do the stove and the dishwasher, then started<br/>\nwiping down the walls.  Then climbed up on the counter and cleaned the<br/>\ntop of the fridge.   I kept him company and we laughed and worked<br/>\ntogether for another few hours and he was so joyful about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile we were doing that, my partner was back in the bedroom, I<br/>\nfigured she was watching a movie or something.  Well when I went back<br/>\nthere, she had completely cleaned the entire room for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was just so neat to be all working together to get our house back in shape.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I decided to tackle my sons bathroom.  He said if I got the<br/>\ntoilet and the tub, he&#39;d get the sink.  He even took everything out<br/>\nfrom under the sink and reorganized it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a nice experience we&#39;ve had!<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45543,"nextTopicId":45614}}
