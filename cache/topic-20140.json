OCD is funny<br/>\n&gt; when you<br/>\n&gt; watch it on MONK, but in real life, its horrible. You&#39;ve heard the phrase<br/>\n&gt; &quot;a place for<br/>\n&gt; everything, and everything in its place&quot;, but with my dad, this was taken<br/>\n&gt; to a new level. I<br/>\n&gt; remember more than one occassion being jerked out of bed in the middle of<br/>\n&gt; the night<br/>\n&gt; because something was a couple of inches out of place and it was my<br/>\n&gt; responsibility to<br/>\n&gt; align it PERFECTLY before being allowed to go back to sleep.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Althought *I* do not have OCD, it has been ingrained in me that things<br/>\n&gt; have to be<br/>\n&gt; cleaned/picked up/put away PERFECTLY. I have worked very hard to overcome<br/>\n&gt; this part of<br/>\n&gt; my upbringing, and I&#39;ve done quite well in a lot of areas. I&#39;ve lowered my<br/>\n&gt; standards on<br/>\n&gt; cleanliness to a point I never thought possible (for instance, I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; remember the last time<br/>\n&gt; I cleaned the bathrooms - hows that for lowered standards!). But...I have<br/>\n&gt; 3 young children<br/>\n&gt; (5.5, 4, 2) with 3 seperate interests and the clutter is tearing me apart<br/>\n&gt; on the inside. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; gone thru the archives, but have only seen stuff on picking up/cleaning<br/>\n&gt; relating to &quot;have<br/>\n&gt; to vs. choose to&quot;, which I don&#39;t feel applies to me. Because of my<br/>\n&gt; upbringing, mentally<br/>\n&gt; &quot;letting go&quot; of the mess is not something I feel I can do. It causes such<br/>\n&gt; incredible anxiety<br/>\n&gt; in me that sometimes I have trouble breathing! I have come to understand<br/>\n&gt; thru reading<br/>\n&gt; Sandra Dodd&#39;s site that if something bothers me, then it is *my*<br/>\n&gt; responsibility to clean it<br/>\n&gt; up. But...I feel I like I am *always* picking up and sacrificing time with<br/>\n&gt; my kids in order to<br/>\n&gt; do this. I don&#39;t wont to sacrfice my time/relationship with them, but I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not sure how to<br/>\n&gt; overcome something that has been so deeply ingrained in me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone have any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Tami<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20131,"nextTopicId":20116}}
