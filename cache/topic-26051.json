Today was day #1 with my cousin&#39;s <br/>\ndtr. Lucky for me, I developed a sinus infection (overnight), have <br/>\nnewly developed cysts on my ovaries which prevent me from walking <br/>\nwithout being on my tiptoes, and am in the midst of my monthly <br/>\ncycle. (Don&#39;t pity me, I did this to myself ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nLucky for her, I am more patient when I am sick.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer temperment is SOOOO different from my kids&#39;, I do have a hard <br/>\ntime understanding how to handle it. Thanks for the insight that it <br/>\nmay be &#39;sensitivity&#39; rather than a deliberate attempt to be <br/>\ndifficult. That&#39;s what I felt today when for the 27th time she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like the way I did something. Not ONE thing pleased her from <br/>\nthe time she awoke. And considering how bend-over-backward-nice I am <br/>\nto my kids, when I can be, nonstop complaints work on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, despite the fact she had 3 minor tantrums (5 sec of screaming <br/>\nand kicking something) and 3 major tantrums (5 min+ of screaming, <br/>\nkicking, and running to throw herself on the bed), today went better <br/>\nthan last visit. Only by how I handled things. I didn&#39;t take things <br/>\npersonally, and I stayed out of her way, only intervening if I heard <br/>\nbickering that lasted more than a few seconds. Only 2 of the <br/>\ntantrums was I present for, and my &#39;no&#39; was the cause-of. The <br/>\ntantrums are not my main concern. The lying and deceitful behavior <br/>\ntroubles me. I&#39;ve caught her in 4 blatant lies in 2 days. I honestly <br/>\nhave lost trust in her words, as well as her intentions. That&#39;s what <br/>\nI struggle with most, though I didn&#39;t put my finger on it until now. <br/>\nDeceit and disregard for others are both hot-buttons for me, and she <br/>\ndoes both.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut HOW you instill honesty and courtesy...it can&#39;t be done in 3 <br/>\ndays by someone else.  (A to Q:her mom is so blessed honest and <br/>\ncourteous...her dad, well, mmmmm...like father, like daughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll try her mom&#39;s suggested 1-2-3-timeout method tomorrow. And <br/>\nafter discussing the day with my cousin, she asked her husband to <br/>\ncall tomorrow to check on things during his lunch break. If she&#39;s <br/>\nhaving the same kind-of day, they&#39;ll make other arrangements for the <br/>\nremainder of the week (he&#39;ll take off work to watch her.)It doesn&#39;t <br/>\nfix the problem HERE, but I really don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a problem that <br/>\nI can fix no matter how long she stays.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, guys, for discussing this subject with me. Your <br/>\nperspectives help a bundle, and just talking about it helps me find <br/>\nsolutions sometimes.<br/>\n <br/>\n:)Lisa O</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26041,"nextTopicId":25987}}
