However, it doesn&#39;t say WHICH<br/>\ntest - you can choose something like the PASS test which can be<br/>\nadministered by you, at home (it does NOT have to be the state test that<br/>\nschools use).  Also, you might want to read<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/testing/tests\">http://sandradodd.com/testing/tests</a> (and check out the links at the<br/>\nbottom as well). Basically, you can make it obvious to yourself and your<br/>\nchild that the tests are not indicative in any way, shape, or form of<br/>\nwhat they know or don&#39;t know or how &#39;smart&#39; they are or anything. Simple<br/>\nstuff, like literally rolling a die or flipping a coin on questions they<br/>\naren&#39;t sure of. Obviously, if they&#39;ve picked the answer by rolling a<br/>\ndie, it has no reflection on what they know, it&#39;s a random answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result needs only be above the 33rd percentile - that&#39;s not 33<br/>\npercent but rather better than 33/100 of the kids taking the same test<br/>\nat the same time. If X gets 2 of 10 questions correct (20%) and 32<br/>\npeople got 1 right and the other 67 got 3 right (to total to 100 people<br/>\nfor even calculation), then X would be in the 33rd percentile.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
