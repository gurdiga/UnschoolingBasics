For example, Yu-Gi-O has lots of connections with Egypt and other ancient cultures.  So that could lead in so many other directions.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 11 yr old son also has read lots of Star Wars, Yu-Gi-O, Bionicle, and lots of anime books.  Its been amazing the other paths his mind has gone to,(from those books).  I just keep talking with him about what he&#39;s reading and the conversations keep going and going.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n***I&#39; can&#39;t help <br/>\nfeeling sad that he has no interest, whatsoever  in all the other wonderful stuff <br/>\nout there.***<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut see, right now he is finding wonderful stuff, his wonderful stuff.  Some day he might choose to read other things that you might think are more worthy.  Or he might not too,  maybe he isn&#39;t interested in everything that you are interested in.  That&#39;s a hard realization.  It was hard and is still hard for me sometimes.  My son doesn&#39;t care to go to museums with me, he doesn&#39;t care to go biking or hiking much with me,  BUT,  he does like sitting with me and discussing politics, strategies in his video games and lots of other stuff.  So, things are good.  :)<br/>\nI would just keep helping him find what he wants to read,  that in itself will deepen your relationship and the trust between you.   You will be amazed at what he can/will learn from his own choices in reading.  <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.  Oh, and have you ever read some of the books he&#39;s chosen?  I&#39;m not saying you need to read everything your kids are reading, its just that its nice sometimes to know what they are talking about when they want to tell you something--some common ground, ya know.   I actually got into a few DragonballZ books,  and I was an English major. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

And what I have noticed over the last 3-4 months is that my son (8) no longer picks out the great literature that he used to.. but he just gravitates towards the Yugioh, Pokemon and Star Wars books. <br/>\n<br/>\n  *****<br/>\n<br/>\n  How much great literature is there for 8yo&#39;s?  And how many of those books speak to his life today?  From what I&#39;ve seen of traditional books for the 7 - 10 crowd (my son is 8) they&#39;re often about kids in school, things like that. There&#39;s just not a lot for an 8yo unschooled boy to relate to. <br/>\n<br/>\n  When we go to the library, Andy always chooses a Pokemon book or two, along with the old standby, Curious George.  I&#39;m not sure what I would consider a classic book for kids.  I tried to share Pippi Longstocking with him recently -- I loved those books as a girl -- but he didn&#39;t want to, because she&#39;s a girl.  Anyone out there know of an unschooled boy book -- well, except for Huck Finn/Tom Sawyer, we have those somewhere around here.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Years ago when my oldest was a poorly reading 8yo (school&#39;s position) my position was that all reading counts, just like everything counts in unschooling.  Whatever a person reads adds to our store of words, understanding of the language and just basic knowledge.  My kids have spent more time reading the funnies, cereal boxes, TV captions, video game instructions, and street signs than books.  Reading is reading, it all should count.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Syl<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  __________________________________________________<br/>\n  Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n  Tired of spam?

And how many of those books speak to his life today?  From what I&#39;ve seen of traditional books for the 7 - 10 crowd (my son is 8) they&#39;re often about kids in school, things like that. There&#39;s just not a lot for an 8yo unschooled boy to relate to. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we go to the library, Andy always chooses a Pokemon book or two, along with the old standby, Curious George.  I&#39;m not sure what I would consider a classic book for kids.  I tried to share Pippi Longstocking with him recently -- I loved those books as a girl -- but he didn&#39;t want to, because she&#39;s a girl.  Anyone out there know of an unschooled boy book -- well, except for Huck Finn/Tom Sawyer, we have those somewhere around here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago when my oldest was a poorly reading 8yo (school&#39;s position) my position was that all reading counts, just like everything counts in unschooling.  Whatever a person reads adds to our store of words, understanding of the language and just basic knowledge.  My kids have spent more time reading the funnies, cereal boxes, TV captions, video game instructions, and street signs than books.  Reading is reading, it all should count.<br/>\n<br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
