Not that<br/>\nwe are broke, but we need to save for the future and<br/>\nhave emergency funds, plus we have no health<br/>\ninsurance.  We make enough not to qualify for Florida<br/>\nKidCare, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAre his desires breaking you financially?  If so, it<br/>\nmay be a good idea for you to seek some type of<br/>\nfinancial planning so that you can in turn help him<br/>\nbreak the cycle of impulse buying. Does unschooling<br/>\nmean that a parent has to go broke in order to give<br/>\nthe child what they want?  As far as what to tell him,<br/>\nmaybe say look &quot;I&#39;ll give you $xx every month  then<br/>\nwe&#39;ll go shopping once every week or two, on whatever<br/>\nday you choose. However, if you spend all of your<br/>\nmoney on that day, we&#39;ll have to wait again until next<br/>\nmonth.&quot;   He has a choice on how to spend the money<br/>\nand what day to go shopping on. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur children 7 and 11 both want to earn money so we&#39;re<br/>\ngiving them some money on Friday to invest in stocks. <br/>\nWe&#39;ve just started learning ourselves so it will be a<br/>\nfamily adventure. It&#39;s never to late to start and it<br/>\ncan be done rather inexpensively.  Ren suggested to me<br/>\nthe other day, maybe open an online Ebay store or<br/>\nsomething.  Maybe your son could sell some of that<br/>\n&quot;freestuff&quot; and make money to buy more &quot;freestuff.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I have no other advice, but that is all I can<br/>\nthink of for now.
