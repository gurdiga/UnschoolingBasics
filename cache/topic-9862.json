This has been going on for a while, <br/>\n&gt; and I  <br/>\n&gt; have no idea what purpose it serves. She &#39;finds&#39; money laying <br/>\n&gt; around  <br/>\n&gt; and claims it as her own. She was stealing money from ME and only  <br/>\n&gt; stopped the last time we went to the store and she asked for a <br/>\n&gt; soda  <br/>\n&gt; and I said I didn&#39;t have enough money. That hasn&#39;t stopped her <br/>\n&gt; from  <br/>\n&gt; getting into the other kids penny banks or wallets. She gets a  <br/>\n&gt; regular allowance, we buy her things when she asks for it, but  <br/>\n&gt; nothing is ever enough. She doesn&#39;t even spend it, she just likes  <br/>\n&gt; saving it up to say she has x dollars. And right now she&#39;s FURIOUS <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; because her big brother got a bunch of cash for his birthday.

Well, today we wanted to <br/>\n&gt; play  <br/>\n&gt; again, but she was doing the same thing, taking money from other  <br/>\n&gt; peoples piles, moving her token, lying about who&#39;s turn it was or  <br/>\n&gt; whether or not someone had paid her or she paid them. Just on and <br/>\n&gt; on.  <br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t stand it anymore! It just makes me sick to my stomach.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If anyone has insight as to why she could be doing this, and some  <br/>\n&gt; appropriate ways for ME to deal, I&#39;d appreciate it. Her brother&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; ready to kill her because she keeps whining about how much money <br/>\n&gt; he  <br/>\n&gt; has, and can she have some, and will he buy her something.

First of all, she&#39;s being treated as flawed<br/>\nthrough these experiences. Instead of focusing on her cheating and<br/>\nstealing, focus on what she NEEDS. She needs to not play those kind of<br/>\ngames probably. She needs games where there is no loser or winner.<br/>\nThere are loads of great alternatives to games like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the &quot;ungame&quot; and a book called &quot;Everybody Wins&quot;, full of great<br/>\ncooperative games. You can explain to her that when everyone plays<br/>\nMonopoly, they want to play by the rules, but that you would be<br/>\nwilling to play with her and SHE gets to make all the rules.<br/>\nThat might fulfill her desire to be &quot;the best&quot; or &quot;winner&quot;.<br/>\nI know it was VERY hard for me to lose at those games when I was<br/>\nyounger, I hated it. I would cheat in a second if I could....but it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t some personality flaw, it was just a stage and lack of experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the stealing part, it really sounds like part of the whole<br/>\ndesire to be &quot;the best&quot; thing. Some people have STRONG urges that way,<br/>\nit will make her a winner later in life when her desires are tempered<br/>\nwith experience. Try to see these issues as part of her personality<br/>\ntraits. They can be positive traits, or negative. It&#39;s your job to<br/>\nhelp her find positive ways to express these desires.....and help keep<br/>\neveryone&#39;s money safe at the same time!!!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nCan she earn some extra money around the house, by doing some side<br/>\njobs? She might be very motivated to do some work for pay, she sound<br/>\nlike a very strong and driven young lady!!:)<br/>\nNo, she can&#39;t take other people&#39;s money, I would make that very clear<br/>\n(as you have) but also offer her ways to get it honestly. She wants<br/>\nmore than you&#39;re giving her, that&#39;s a valid desire.<br/>\nI hated being dependent upon my parents for money...it made me feel<br/>\nhelpless and out of control. I NEEDED to earn my own money and have<br/>\ncontrol over it. She may need the same thing.<br/>\nI don&#39;t like other people deciding how much money I get either!;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to see these things as very real needs and desires. Find a way to<br/>\nhelp her attain them honestly and help her understand the need for<br/>\ntrust. She needs to trust that she can attain what she needs without<br/>\nfear of guilt or shame and the family needs to trust her to leave<br/>\ntheir stuff alone!!:)<br/>\nDon&#39;t focus too much on the whole &quot;cheating&quot; and &quot;stealing&quot; thing.<br/>\nFocus on personal boundaries, helping her respect those and finding<br/>\nways to honor her. I understand it&#39;s frustrating, but she knows you<br/>\nsee her as flawed right now...that won&#39;t help her grow beyong this and<br/>\nfeel positive about her very real desires.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: question about stealing","postDate":"1139336264","msgId":9870,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRzYW84OCtnYjFiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRzYW11OCtnZnVsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9867,"nextInTopic":9871,"prevInTime":9869,"nextInTime":9871,"topicId":9862,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*This may come through twice.

They had a very hard time <br/>\nputting themselves in someone&#39;s place and didn&#39;t quite care that <br/>\nthey were hurting someone else with their actions.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Disclaimer: My parenting ways come from having two children with <br/>\nattachment disorder and some of my tactics are to, first, help my <br/>\nchildren heal from past hurt and trauma and, second, help them have <br/>\nemotional attachment to the rest of the family. I can only speak for <br/>\nmy family and how we deal with it**     <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst thing we did was have a family meeting. We talked about being <br/>\nable to live in a home that is safe for everyone and that respecting <br/>\neach other was important to us. I knew that it would be a long time <br/>\nbefore that way of living became a part of who they are but we still <br/>\ntalked about it and led by example. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest obstacle we&#39;re been trying to overcome is their lack of <br/>\ncause and effect and their lack of empathy. Because of their <br/>\nlifestyle before us adopting them, they don&#39;t give thought to how <br/>\ntheir actions affect the rest of the family. What I have done, and I <br/>\nfound this to he the only thing that has been helping, is to talk <br/>\nabout it, as a family, each time it happens. Whoever the &quot;victim&quot; is <br/>\n(usually my youngest) talks about how she feels when their sibling <br/>\nsteals from them, how they don&#39;t feel respected in their home, how <br/>\nthey don&#39;t trust that sibling because of what they did. I validate <br/>\ntheir feelings and talk about how I felt when a friend of mine stole <br/>\nsomething from me. After that, the one who did the stealing (or <br/>\nwhatever it was) gets their chance to explain/apologise/offer <br/>\nrestitution, etc.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been my experience that when my older two steal and cheat, they <br/>\ndon&#39;t give thought to how it makes the other person feel and that is <br/>\nthe way I approach this. Their stealing is an emotional issue. it <br/>\ncomes from not having enough love, trust & security in their lives. <br/>\nWhen they were in foster care they were given so much stuff and now <br/>\nthey think that money and material things are what they need to make <br/>\nthem feel good about themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...hang in there. I know it&#39;s tough. Maybe like someone else <br/>\nsaid, it&#39;s the age. I don&#39;t know, my 7 year old doesn&#39;t steal or <br/>\ncheat. She&#39;s doesn&#39;t have reason to. <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (7), Shawna (10) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 30, 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My seven yo is really causing me concern....and I don&#39;t know how <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; handle it.
