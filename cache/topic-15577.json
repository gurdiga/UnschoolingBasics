Some days we have<br/>\npopsicles for breakfast and other mornings Kirsten asks for a banana or<br/>\ncereal.  Letting go of &quot;my&quot; expectations of what she &quot;should&quot; be eating and<br/>\ntrusting her to learn for herself when she&#39;s had enough hershey kisses, has<br/>\nallowed me to observe and be present with her.  Talking about choices and<br/>\nproviding a variety of food at all times has really brought us closer.  Some<br/>\ndays I&#39;m astounded by how much she doesn&#39;t eat of the items she asks for. I<br/>\nthink she is probably still testing me at times to see if I will tell her<br/>\n&quot;no&quot; when she asks for the 4th pack of gummies.<br/>\nI&#39;ve taken this principle and applied it to some of the things that happen<br/>\nday to day.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe likes to dress up and found a pair of fuzzy footed pj&#39;s this morning.<br/>\nThe former me would have battled over that because &quot;it&#39;s July!&quot;  Much to hot<br/>\nfor footie pj&#39;s.  Instead of starting an argument over it, we just went<br/>\nahead and put them on.  Just one little example of things I am trying to be<br/>\nconscious of.<br/>\n.......and so I&#39;m beginning to wonder just why I&#39;ve made things so hard on<br/>\nmy older kids for so long!<br/>\nAnywho....lots of little steps in a different direction for us.<br/>\nThanks to all who spend their time and energy here answering questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nRenee<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/dazynay\">http://360.yahoo.com/dazynay</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13436,"nextTopicId":15485}}
