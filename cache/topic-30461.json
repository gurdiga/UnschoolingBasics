Our family is  <br/>\ndifferent from every other family on the planet, and thus our needs  <br/>\nand desires are different.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second item is addressed by my favorite quote &quot;I have never let  <br/>\nmy schooling get in the way of my education&quot;, Twain. Sure, having a  <br/>\ncollege degree, and even experience teaching in a university setting  <br/>\nis cool. But is by no means the penultimate in being educated, and it  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t necessarily reflect wisdom. My MIL was an eighth grade  <br/>\ngraduate, but one of the most intelligent, knowledge-filled people I  <br/>\nknow. Mostly this was because she had a great passion for knowledge,  <br/>\nand the support of her family in choosing a life that suited her.<br/>\n<br/>\nChronic illnesses don&#39;t change my opinion on whether or not  <br/>\nunschooling is effective, I think. If we believe that we learn  <br/>\nthrough living, then living a quality life, regardless of physical  <br/>\nlimitations, is important. We actually came to unschooling when I was  <br/>\non bedrest for premature labor. Up until then, we had followed a  <br/>\nschool-at-home program. Lo and behold, they were learning MORE  <br/>\nwithout me interrupting them lol!<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Kelly&#39;s list of traits.

I&#39;ve met with criticism from DH, but he&#39;s  <br/>\nputting all his eggies in one basket with me now :) It took TIME and is still  <br/>\ntaking that time, for that matter. But it&#39;s happening. Results, seeing the kids  <br/>\nfeel good and expand, are helping the most, too. Plus, I have his culture  <br/>\ninvolved, which basically allows for the woman to be the Supreme Ruler of All  <br/>\nThat Is Child ;) So, yes, I USE that one :) <br/>\n <br/>\nHang in there, Jenny! I&#39;ll get  better. Hope you&#39;re feeling  well.<br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************It&#39;s Tax Time! Get tips, forms, and advice on AOL Money & <br/>\nFinance.

Sure, if the parent is a college <br/>\nprofessor, their kid is going to learn a lot and do well. And if the <br/>\nparent has her own business grooming dogs or whatever, then she&#39;s <br/>\nobviously got drive and an entreprenuerial capability, so I&#39;m not <br/>\nsurprised that her son is doing so well.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words ... it sounds like he&#39;s saying, &quot;Unschooling can be <br/>\ngood, and these families are obviously successful, but you&#39;re not <br/>\ndoing it right, and I don&#39;t think you have what it takes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be fair to mention that I do, in fact, have a chronic <br/>\nillness.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, any comments about that sort of thinking? Also, is there a <br/>\nlist anywhere (or would you care to write one?) about what kinds of <br/>\ntraits a parents &quot;needs&quot; to be successful at unschooling? I&#39;m sure <br/>\nthere are necessary traits, but I tend to doubt that &quot;be a college <br/>\nprofessor&quot; is one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\nJenny</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30453,"nextTopicId":30351}}
