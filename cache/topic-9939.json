One of the <br/>\nmistakes I recently realized I was making (thanks to this group) is that I have <br/>\nbeen using guilt to motivate my children to clean up after themselves.  A lot. <br/>\n Thanks for helping make me aware of that.  I am working hard at breaking <br/>\nthis nasty habit.  I am always striving to do better and am far from the patient, <br/>\neasy going mom I want to become so I really appreciate the broad spectrum of <br/>\ndiscussions that I have read here.  It is not at all what I expected and not <br/>\nat all like the other homeschooling lists I&#39;m on.  If someone writes about a <br/>\nparenting issue most moderators of other e-groups request that this type of not <br/>\nhs related discussions be taken off loop.  Anyway, thanks for all your <br/>\nsharing.  My children appreciate what I&#39;m learning here and it really is all related <br/>\nif we are homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nRobin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9917,"nextTopicId":9933}}
