According to the New York state regs, you do have to send in the scores and if they are inadequate, you will be put on academic probation.  Here&#39;s the section of the regs:<br/>\n<br/>\n (v) If a score on a test is determined to be inadequate, the program shall be placed on probation pursuant to subdivision (i) of this section. A student&#39;s score shall be deemed adequate if:<br/>\n<br/>\n             (a) the student has a composite score above the thirty-third percentile on national norms; or<br/>\n<br/>\n             (b) the student&#39;s score reflects one academic year of growth as compared to a test administered during or subsequent to the prior school year.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there is a consequence for a poor score.  And as I&#39;m allowing my kids to learn what they want, when they want, that is a concern for me.  I also know that being the person I am (I was very anal about school and tests and overstudied for everything - LOL.  I don&#39;t know why, but to me knowledge was (and still is deep down inside of me)of the utmost value), I&#39;m afraid that I will be impacted by any score she gets, and I don&#39;t want that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI originally was going to do it as a game, here&#39;s a bunch of questions, let&#39;s see how many we can answer (with the use of books, google, etc.).  But I know sometimes dd does feel academically inadequate because of her schooled friends or a show on tv.  So, now I&#39;m thinking I like Sharon&#39;s first option of not saying a thing and just taking it myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarla<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d ask her what she wants to do, personally, but first check and see what happens if she &quot;does poorly&quot; - are there consequences you&#39;d rather not deal with?
