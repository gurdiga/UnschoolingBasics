Dentists frown on apples and pears and other fruits because of the sugar and the acids. Do you want to think about food in those ways? Or once was labelled as a carcinogen and now is being demonstrated to be good for you like coffee and chocolate and wine? Or by color, white versus green versus brown versus red versus yellow? It&#39;s all food. It&#39;s what you are hungry for that matters. If Linnaea or Simon ask for food I will narrow it down by asking sweet versus savoury or quick versus cooked or a platter versus a specific request. I don&#39;t ever say junk versus healthy. I don&#39;t think I even think in those terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday Linnaea and I made beet ice cream. Is that junk food or is it healthy? What about carrot cake, or oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, or beet brownies? I&#39;ve been making these really weird pancakes lately from Kenny Shopsin&#39;s cookbook; mac and cheese pancakes and Slutty cakes which have a center of pumpkin and peanut butter mixed together with pumpkin pie spice. They are so yummy. In the cookbook he writes: &quot;Anybody who is tempted to question my use of frozen pancake batter might want to stop and think about what pancakes really are. They are flour and milk drowned in better and some form of sugar. They&#39;re crap. As far as food value, you might as well take Crisco, whip it up with powdered sugar and spread it on your face. I am not saying they&#39;re not delicious or that you shouldn&#39;t eat them, but they&#39;re a luxury, a recreation, lke smoking marijuana or having sex.&quot; I don&#39;t think pancakes would have ever fallen into a category of junk food for me, it&#39;s fun<br/>\n to read someone else&#39;s take. He has this interesting theory about why people stop eating certain foods when they are full, foods they really enjoy and click with, but with foods that they feel obligated to eat, like salads, they keep eating and eating and eating, they never click. I like Kenny Shopsin.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much!
