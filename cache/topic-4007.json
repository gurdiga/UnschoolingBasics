I&#39;m Laurie, have a 4 yo DS and my DD will be 2 in Feb (I also<br/>\nhave one on the way in March).  I&#39;m an ex-preschool teacher and an<br/>\nex-computer help desk person, along with several other career changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really not sure how I even came across The Unschooling Handbook<br/>\nbut I&#39;m in love with the ideas.  I&#39;m very interested in talking with<br/>\nother moms who&#39;ve US from the start of the &quot;schooling&quot; years and<br/>\nparticularly anyone with kids the same ages.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read The US Handbook and scoured the web for more info.  I have a<br/>\ncouple books on my Cmas wish list at Amazon.  If you were just<br/>\nstarting out again, which books would you say were &quot;must reads&quot;<br/>\n(again, particularly interested in early childhood if possible)?<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that our days are spent watching PBSkids, reading lots of<br/>\nstories to DS (who will listen for hours) and playing with his Buzz<br/>\nLightyear toys & DD&#39;s babydolls.  ;)  Coming from teaching preschool<br/>\nand going to unschooling is a step that I certainly want to take but<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve got the whole idea yet.  Is this what other early<br/>\nchildhood families do during the day?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3938,"nextTopicId":1097}}
