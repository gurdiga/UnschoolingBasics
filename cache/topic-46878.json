(And I may crop the  <br/>\nphotos a bit to make them fit the blog format unless you let me know  <br/>\nit&#39;s not okay.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love love to have photos to help illustrate this :-) You can find  <br/>\nsome, send them to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAt some point I&#39;ll start a Facebook group for it. The kind that sends  <br/>\nyou alerts and emails that there&#39;s been a new post. (I am a noob at FB  <br/>\nso if anyone can offer tips, I&#39;d sure appreciate it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m about to start a job (one that like pays you cash for doing  <br/>\nstuff!) working in the bakery at the grocery store, so like I really  <br/>\nneed a new project! ;-) But this one won&#39;t let me go and keeps nagging  <br/>\nme to start it. I can&#39;t promise the pictures will go up fast! But I  <br/>\nwill do my best to get them up there since I think it could be quite  <br/>\nlovely and useful for explaining unschooling. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46870,"nextTopicId":46918}}
