When the father Sam Waterston becomes aware of this, he asks <br/>\nher to &quot;bring him around sometime ... let me get a look in his eyes&quot;. The scene is <br/>\nwonderfully acted, portraying him as asserting his rights to play the role of guardian and <br/>\nprotector, without wanting to unneccessarily control or interfere with her, or <br/>\nunneccessarily scare off the boy. Perhaps watching the scene would help you to better <br/>\nidentify what your own feelings are. And the movie is a very good one overall so worth <br/>\nseeing anyway - check out the Amazon reviews.<br/>\n-- Mark V.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;annx33&quot; &lt;amcarlson@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My 13 year old dd has been developing a relationship online with a boy.

This has been a big shift for me in my <br/>\nparenting style and I have to really work at it but it is getting <br/>\neasier.  once I am clear about why I feel uncomfortable and can <br/>\nexpress it to her we can work on a solution together.  Sometimes I <br/>\nrealize it&#39;s not a big deal and can let it go, sometimes she can see <br/>\nthe validity of my reason and she lets it go and soemtimes we work out <br/>\na compromise.  I can see why you would be uncomfortable with letting <br/>\nyou daughter spend time with a boy when you have not met him and he <br/>\nseems unwilling to hang out at your house.  That would feel like more <br/>\nof a safety issue than a trust issue to me.
