But sometimes they really  <br/>\ncan&#39;t and if the mom could only see it from a different vantage  <br/>\npoint, I think she&#39;d see that the time spent NOW with the needy child  <br/>\nwill do more to create peace in her family then the benefit mom will  <br/>\nget from the adult interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nPreaching to the choir, here, I&#39;m sure.
