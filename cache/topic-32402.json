The only hard thing has been helping recovery from school,  <br/>\nthe oldest two were severely depressed, they both spent five years in  <br/>\nschool. We spent SO much time healing from that, two years nearly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a large family can have its more chaotic moments, but I&#39;ve  <br/>\nseen ways that it&#39;s easier as well. My friend has only one, and she  <br/>\nworks very hard to keep her entertained, and is driving all the time  <br/>\nto find playmates. Whereas we have them built-in! Of course, being  <br/>\nsiblings makes them no more likely to play together, but it&#39;s worked  <br/>\nwell for us. There are times when I see how nice it is to have one or  <br/>\ntwo, because you can focus so much on the interests of one child  <br/>\nwithout all the hard compromising that we do for getting out of the  <br/>\nhouse, going to outings or sessions when one child wants to, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a paying job, but I was running an NPO for the majority  <br/>\nof the time we&#39;ve been unschooling.

I loved the work, but I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like feeling that I was always having to choose between work  <br/>\nand kids and me.

LARGE FAMILIES AND UNSCHOOLING ARE THE <br/>\nBEST TOGETHER!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks so very much for your input, Kathleen!!  I so know what you mean about the chaos happening to be: running around the house, playing in the dark, etc... And ESPECIALLY being joyful! That is one of the best parts for me! Just watching them play (and getting in there right along with em&#39;) is great! Right now our two dd&#39;s, who are 4 and 2 (a very very agile 2) have climbed up onto the kitchen counter to sit with their legs dangling and they&#39;re singing loudly and acting out some kind of scenario. This is just &quot;the greatest&quot; for them cause they&#39;re &quot;so high&quot; and love to jump down and roll, while I&#39;m watching from the corner of my eye ready to catch and struggling about whether or not to tell them to get down! LOL. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Anyway, I feel as though we have instinctively fell into what seems most like an unschooling way in the last few months, especially once I learned how to start letting go of my &quot;schooling&quot; mentality. And the boys absolutely HATE workbooks and are truly learning things on their own much more effectively than when I was trying to do &quot;school at home&quot;. When I finally left our 7 YO alone (we were in a charter and I quit) 2 weeks later he was interested in a book his bro was reading and so he picked it up and read through almost half of it. When he showed me that he was actually reading it, when I thought he didn&#39;t know how to read, that was my moment when I realized there&#39;s something to this &quot;self led learning&quot; thing. When the boys were in ps I was having such a hard time of it! And just watching them change for the worse was heartbreaking. I&#39;m so happy I followed my instincts to start over! <br/>\n  As far as adding to the family I couldn&#39;t even think about it during &quot;our other life&quot;. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d make it as a successful parent. I was failing them! Homework freaked me out and even with them gone for HOURS a day I was more tired then than I am now!!  Our lives &quot;HAD&quot; to have so much structure,schedules,rules,boundaries. We put ourselves into a box! My dh and I almost made the decision to have Zoe be the last baby &quot;final&quot;. But thank goodness we didn&#39;t!! And now have whole new perspectives and feel that a larger family would be soooo fun and fit our natural dynamics.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks again!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Meliss   <br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

The next <br/>\ntwo jumped through school hoops and came home at sixth and fourth <br/>\ngrade.  The next two helped us finally start the journey. One was <br/>\nlabled a trouble maker and one was labled learning disabled. I found <br/>\nboth of those lables inaccurate and dangerous. They were in second and <br/>\nfirst grade at the time. The other kids have barely any school <br/>\nreference at all. Other than tv&#39;s portrayal. It took us several years <br/>\nto then fully embrace unschooling.Or really fully get it;]<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is wonderful with a large family. It makes so much sense <br/>\nand my kids are so thriving.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as chaos I do not see it anymore than any other house. I think <br/>\nperhaps less in lots of ways. My kids are not coerced or controlled. <br/>\nAllowing them to be expressions of who they are, rather than an act of <br/>\nrebellion fighting against external controls. We have moments of chaos, <br/>\nwhen they are playing games in the dark, running through the house, but <br/>\nit is joyful chaos.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my house is probably no more chaotic than yours. I often forget <br/>\nhow large we are. Until I see another large family get out of a vehicle <br/>\nand then it like.. WOW!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to the show the other day to see Iron Man and when bought the <br/>\ntickets I said ten.. LOL. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as fitting in an outside job stuff. I am not sure how I would do <br/>\nthat today. I do a lot from home. I am an activist and have several <br/>\nsmall home business things going on. My dh works long hard hours for us <br/>\nand me being gone very much at all would put a strain on our family. I <br/>\nthink if dh was home more I could pursue more outside stuff.
