I think I saw it this way b/c<br/>\nall I knew about unschooling was that it meant that you trusted that your<br/>\nchildren would learn everything they needed to learn through the normalcies<br/>\nof daily life and pursuing their interests.  I didn&#39;t realize the whole<br/>\npartnership aspect until I started reading posts here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you just joining and having your views questioned, I joined<br/>\nthis group just a few months ago, and can&#39;t tell you how much it has already<br/>\nimpacted my life.  In the beginning I like so many others was responding to<br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s post and put up an explanation of how I do things not looking<br/>\nfor any response to my post except by the person I was responding to, whom<br/>\nin fact never responded.  Instead I received the same overwhelming response<br/>\nto my statements on limitations of tv and food, specifically.  Though at the<br/>\ntime I felt like I was being slammed it has since given me much food for<br/>\nthought, and I&#39;ve even begun shedding layers on these issues.  That&#39;s what<br/>\nthis group is all about.  I hope all you newbies will take as much from this<br/>\ngroup as I have.<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13366,"nextTopicId":13508}}
