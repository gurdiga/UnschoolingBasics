Things like slices of cheese cut <br/>\ninto shapes with mini cookie cutters are fun and easy. So is string <br/>\ncheese - portable, single serving stuff. Nuts are handy snacks too. <br/>\nMaybe even make up little mini cheeseburgers that can be eaten in one <br/>\nor two bites. Last summer, DS went through a longish spurt of eating <br/>\nhot dogs cold straight from the fridge (not my first choice lol) <br/>\nbecause they were quick and easy - he could grab one and be nearly <br/>\ndone with it by the time he got back to the where the game system was.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We&#39;ve already identified some triggers for him as well.  <br/>\n&gt;Unfortunatly,<br/>\n&gt; video games seems to be a trigger for him.  I&#39;ve gone from severe<br/>\n&gt; limiting to no limits since I took him out of school 2 years ago.  <br/>\n&gt;The<br/>\n&gt; problem isn&#39;t while he&#39;s playing.  It&#39;s afterwards.  He will go<br/>\n&gt; absolutely bonkers!  (and I do mean a much more extreme version of <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; word bonkers.)  And there is no stopping him!  I&#39;ve always been at<br/>\n&gt; somewhat of a loss over this.  It&#39;s extremely frustrating, but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; him.  He&#39;s always been that way.  I&#39;m going to try offering him <br/>\n&gt;better<br/>\n&gt; snacks and more water while he plays.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I might look at what it is about the *situation* that leads to the <br/>\nbehavior rather than saying it&#39;s the games. For instance, is he <br/>\nplaying in a near-dark room (my guys often lose track of time and it <br/>\nheads toward sunset and they didn&#39;t realize how dark it actually was <br/>\nin the room until I came in and turned on a light); is there enough <br/>\nspace for him to move as he plays (wireless controllers are a MUST at <br/>\nour house so DS can jump and move while playing); when he stops, what <br/>\nhappens next? For instance, is there a space where he CAN get very <br/>\nphysical for a while. I know that DS absolutely NEEDS big muscle <br/>\nactivity. While he is VERY active while playing (I get tired watching <br/>\nhim play videogames he uses so much energy at it) it&#39;s not the same <br/>\nthing. So, I&#39;ll try to arrange some silly game such as &quot;boy pinball&quot; <br/>\nwhere he bounces off furniture and walls and tries to get past <br/>\nmy &quot;flippers&quot;. Or, I&#39;ll suggest he get on our new exercise bike (he <br/>\nused to use the mini trampoline often but that&#39;s lost a bit to the <br/>\nbike). We&#39;ve also got an adjustable, kid level (in terms of height <br/>\nand firmness) punching bag (a &quot;peanut&quot; bag) for him to just pound on. <br/>\nEven something like asking for his assistance to bring firewood up <br/>\nfrom the basement to help start a fire is good - anything that really <br/>\nexerts those big muscles in his arms, legs, and back. On the other <br/>\nhand but still related, I&#39;ll often offer a back rub or foot rub to <br/>\nhim and give him some good deep muscle massaging (often with <br/>\nsomething like soothing vanilla scented lotion). It still gets to the <br/>\nheart of the muscle-need.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244317154,"authorName":"swissarmy_wife","from":"&quot;swissarmy_wife&quot; &lt;heatherbean@...&gt;","profile":"swissarmy_wife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"To Heather Was Re:saying stop","postDate":"1202762967","msgId":29639,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZvcWNjbyt1NW8zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1Mzk1MjA4QEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":29636,"nextInTopic":29640,"prevInTime":29638,"nextInTime":29640,"topicId":29636,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks, we re going to give this a shot.

And, too, sometimes it meant going to the kitchen at 9 pm and<br/>\nmaking a cheese omelette by request.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result of this is that, over time, we&#39;ve gotten into a habit of<br/>\nspreading out proteins over the whole day more. Particularly, having<br/>\nprotein in the morning seems to set the stage for a better day over all.<br/>\nSo, a whole grain English muffin with nut butter is good, as is oatmeal<br/>\nbecause DS and DH like penut butter on <br/>\ntheir oatmeal (gives me the willies but it&#39;s their choice - serving<br/>\noatmeal in our house is like a build-your-own-sundae party lol) And, DS<br/>\nhas become sensitive to how it feels when he&#39;s just starting to need<br/>\nprotein and we can get to it *before* it becomes an issue. Prevention is<br/>\na whole lot easier than mopping up.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t know if that answers anything but there you have it. If you have<br/>\nspecific thoughts or questions, feel free and I&#39;ll come up with<br/>\nsomething or other :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
