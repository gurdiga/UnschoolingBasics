I took all the little <br/>\ncontainers of craft supplies and moved them so they wouldn&#39;t be knocked all <br/>\nover the place and told him to go ahead and throw all he wanted. he said, <br/>\nyou mean I can throw it?  I said, well you were doing it anyway when I said <br/>\nnot to, so go ahead!  maybe at times I am too uptight.  last night I didn&#39;t <br/>\nsay a word when my boys were running threw the house shooting and throwing <br/>\nplay knives at each other and then winding yard all around the house.  they <br/>\nhad a blast.  fortunately dh stayed upstairs and so he didn&#39;t get all <br/>\nannoyed.  I am really trying to implement the RU lifestyle here as best I <br/>\ncan.  Yet I still find myself saying No without even thinking or asking <br/>\nmyself why not?  so I am working on it.  there is so much for me to learn! <br/>\nso many things to let go of!  this list is helping me tremendously though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as for the unschooling part of RU I am still working on that too.  dh <br/>\nis not on board with un-schooling. I can&#39;t say I am totally sure of it <br/>\neither.  I do like to teach them things, when I have time which seems like <br/>\nnever.  But I am not sure if I know how to unschool them but at the same <br/>\ntime not neglect them.  This morning my oldest stayed home from school <br/>\n(long story, I thought he was getting his report card last night but I was <br/>\na week off and we were waiting for that before making the decision to pull <br/>\nhim out.....he will go a few more days....) and I went down and spent about <br/>\nan hour helping him finally finish building the megabloks ninja turtles <br/>\nhouse that he got last Christmas.  Plus I played ball with him some in the <br/>\nafternoon.  And he did a little of his home work. But other than that I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t do anything one on one with him.  Is that enough? Plus I haven&#39;t <br/>\ndone a thing wrt teaching my 6 yo (k) to read or math or anything since the <br/>\nschool year began.  But he is always very busy playing etc.  And I do <br/>\nusually read to the 6 and 3 yo at bed time.  Is that enough for now? (also <br/>\nhave a baby to keep me busy).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:28 PM 10/27/2006 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Why not get in there and throw play dough with them?

There are, of course, times when we might need to dip into  <br/>\nour emergency bag and just say &quot;No, stop,&quot; because what they&#39;re doing  <br/>\nis dangerous or destructive and we can&#39;t at the moment think of a  <br/>\nbetter way. But the less they hear no, the more likely they are to  <br/>\nlisten when we really need them to.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the most common source of parenting frustration is trying to  <br/>\ncontrol kids, make them behave, make them act right, stop them from  <br/>\nmaking our lives more difficult. If you set your life&#39;s goal as  <br/>\nherding cats, think what a life of frustration it would be. If you  <br/>\nset you life&#39;s goal as enjoying who the cats are, life for all of you  <br/>\nwould be more pleasant. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nKids *are* messy. And loud. And autonomous beings with needs that are  <br/>\ninconvenient to a relaxing life. The sooner we accept that, the  <br/>\neasier it is to start letting go and stop trying to make our lives  <br/>\ninto some sitcom image we have in our heads of kids that are snarky  <br/>\nfor 26 minutes and 30 seconds until they see how right their parents  <br/>\nare in the last 30 seconds so the credits can roll ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re trying to get some renewal in your life by trying to  <br/>\ncontrol your family into giving it to you, it could be you need to  <br/>\nget away and do something just for yourself for an hour or so a week.  <br/>\nAsk your husband to watch them so you can go to Borders and read for  <br/>\na while, or take a bath, or go for a walk. It&#39;s really hard to give  <br/>\nwhen we&#39;re tapped out ourselves, but it doesn&#39;t work to try to get  <br/>\nthe kids to give us the peace we need.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m throwing out a lot of ideas here and some or all may be missing  <br/>\nthe mark. There isn&#39;t much to go on, but this play dough incident  <br/>\nsounds like a last straw issue. So I&#39;m assuming there&#39;s a whole lot  <br/>\nmore than play dough going on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I will ask them not to and<br/>\n&gt; they will do it right in front of me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There might be a number of reasons for this:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be that your automatic response is &quot;No,&quot; so the word has  <br/>\nlost its meaning. It may not feel to you like you say no a lot, but  <br/>\nthey&#39;re reacting and responding based on *their* perception, not yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be that your requests *FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW* make no sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n From their point of view, whatever issue that has your panties in a  <br/>\nknot is not high on their priority list. It may be play dough in the  <br/>\ncarpet. Or play dough bits going everywhere that you&#39;re envisioning  <br/>\nhaving to clean up. Or waste. Or whatever. It doesn&#39;t make a  <br/>\ndifference. From *their* point of view they&#39;d rather have no carpet,  <br/>\nor a dough-mud-paint splattered play place, or whatever it is that&#39;s  <br/>\nblocking them from being free to play. From *their* point of view,  <br/>\nyour actions say &quot;I don&#39;t care what you want. This is what I want and  <br/>\nwhat I want is important so you need to stop making it so difficult.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re right and you&#39;re wrong. It means your  <br/>\nvisions of life are clashing. As the one who decided to bring them  <br/>\ninto the world, you&#39;re the one who needs to figure out how to fit  <br/>\nyour goals around their goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they&#39;re ignoring you to deliberately do what you&#39;ve asked them not  <br/>\nto do, then there&#39;s something more going on than not listening. And  <br/>\nyou&#39;ll need to do some serious self-examination. See the world  <br/>\nthrough their eyes rather than seeing them as deliberately defiant.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this will help: One of your goals is to create a home for your  <br/>\nfamily. Their goal is to play. Your goals are clashing. But as a  <br/>\nmindful parent your goal is to get those *goals* to mesh and work  <br/>\ntogether *not* get your kids to mesh with your goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now their perception is that your goal is to make life more  <br/>\nconvenient and less difficult for you. And your &quot;no&#39;s&quot; are oriented  <br/>\ntowards that goal. But since your &quot;no&#39;s&quot; are interfering with their  <br/>\ngoals, and you apparently don&#39;t care about what they want, they are  <br/>\nshowing you the same lack of caring about your goals and wants.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re learning by example to treat others&#39; needs and wants as less  <br/>\nimportant than their own. They&#39;re learning they need to fight to get  <br/>\nwhat they want because you&#39;re their adversary.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it may *feel* like you give and give and give so you have the  <br/>\nright to draw the line. But from their point of view, they know  <br/>\neverything the want to do is in your power to grant or deny. Imagine  <br/>\nliving with a husband who, though generous, could use his power to  <br/>\ntell you when to go to bed, when to get up, when and what to eat,  <br/>\nwhat and how much to watch on TV, whether or not you could go to the  <br/>\nstore and how much you could spend, and required a convincing  <br/>\nexplanation that met his needs for you when you wanted to buy  <br/>\nsomething for yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s exhausting just thinking of living life like that. And yet  <br/>\nthat&#39;s how conventionally parented kids live. And the harsher it is,  <br/>\nthe sooner they want to leave home.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get back on the mindful parenting track, you need to create  <br/>\nconfidence in them that your goal is to help them get what they want.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s your top priority. You may not always be able to forge a  <br/>\ndirect path, you may have to find a different -- and better :-) --  <br/>\noption than the one they&#39;re asking for or put something off until the  <br/>\nnext day -- and then move the earth to make it happen the next day  <br/>\nuntil they&#39;re rock solid certain that their needs *are* at the top of  <br/>\nyour list. But you want to work towards a certainty that you&#39;re their  <br/>\npartner and advocate rather than their adversary.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Then* when they&#39;re confident that you&#39;re trying to help them, *then*  <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be willing to work with you rather than against you. Right  <br/>\nnow it sounds like they&#39;re fighting against you to get what they want  <br/>\nbecause you&#39;re adversaries, each trying to be the one to get to your  <br/>\nrespective goals. They know you hold the power to grant or deny. And  <br/>\nthey need to fight to get what they want. Stop the struggle. Be their  <br/>\npartner. And they&#39;ll be yours. (It will take time though! You can&#39;t  <br/>\nbe their partner with the idea to make them yours. It has to be a  <br/>\nfree gift because that&#39;s what you want to give.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I left them in the art room and they<br/>\n&gt; are still throwing I can hear it and hear them screaming with  <br/>\n&gt; laughter as<br/>\n&gt; they do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If there&#39;s a choice between laughter and tears, which would you choose?<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps what it feels like is that they&#39;re laughing at you. It  <br/>\nperhaps feels sort of mocking when they&#39;re laughing and having a good  <br/>\ntime doing something you&#39;ve asked them not to.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurn your view point around. They&#39;re laughing because they&#39;re happy  <br/>\nand having fun. And you&#39;re trying to be, what someone called, the fun  <br/>\npolice. And it makes you angry that they&#39;re having fun (and you&#39;re  <br/>\nnot.) There&#39;s often a bit of jealousy in parents that their kids  <br/>\n*can* be so free of care and responsibility. (Not &quot;have to&quot; pick up  <br/>\nall that play dough.) The thing is that when we were kids it was  <br/>\nimplied that when we were adults it would be our turn to get what we  <br/>\nwanted. But when we got to be adults and took on responsibilities  <br/>\n(and filled our heads full of &quot;have tos&quot; and &quot;can&#39;ts&quot;) we realized  <br/>\nthat was a big fat lie. And we&#39;re unconsciously resentful. We&#39;ve got  <br/>\nthis voice in the backs of our heads that says &quot;When&#39;s it going to be  <br/>\nmy turn?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we *can* get what we want. It just isn&#39;t going to look like we  <br/>\nthought it would and we need to go about it differently than stealing  <br/>\nit from our kids the way our parents may have stolen their turns from  <br/>\nus.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot of stuff here (on the right):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com\">http://sandradodd.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nthat will help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is mainly the 9 yo.

I&#39;m sure other&#39;s will have much better advice.  But I will put my two cents worth in.  I also have days that the WILD, OUT OF CONTROL BEHAVIOR, just grates on me and wears me down.  My six year old has possible AS and SPD.  She is just so wild, and she can keep up the wild and hyper for hours.  Yesterday she shoved her sister against a window.......not because she was mad at her but because she was just goofing off and being wild. And I&#39;m still trying to figure it all out myself.  But so far the only thing that I have found that has worked is to separate my children.   I realize that does not solve your whole picture, but there are just times I put one kid on one floor of my house and another kid on the other floor and tell them they just can not be together right now.  So far it is working really well.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nRue Kream &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skreams@...\">skreams@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Posted anonymously at member&#39;s request.<br/>\n*******************<br/>\nthey are throwing play dough. they won&#39;t stop.
