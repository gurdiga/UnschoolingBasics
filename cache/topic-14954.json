I have received some great advice that helped my family <br/>\ndiscuss the issues and brainstorm compromises and solutions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA funny side issue is that our refrigerator broke this morning.  We <br/>\ndecided to buy a new one and we got one to fit the changes we hope <br/>\nto make.  The refrigerator part is wider than our old side-by-side, <br/>\nso the kids are already figuring out how to fit water bottles, juice <br/>\nboxes and small individual sized containers with fruits, veggies, <br/>\ndeli meats and cheese.  We have plans to go grocery shopping after <br/>\nour refrigerator is delivered tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also appreciate the notes about Kaiser and possibly going outside <br/>\nthe system.  We all agree that the last doctor I had was not the <br/>\ngreatest, yet I share some of the blame too for not recognizing the <br/>\nneed to get a new doctor.  We are interested in hearing what the new <br/>\ndoctor has to say.  He has already done more for us in one visit <br/>\nthan my other doctor did in years.  We have a follow-up appt. in a <br/>\ncouple of weeks to discuss the things we&#39;ve done to date.  If I <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel like things are improving for my son, I will get him <br/>\nevaluated outside the Kaiser system.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14952,"nextTopicId":14956}}
