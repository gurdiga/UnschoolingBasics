Two problems: simply turning<br/>\nsideways/backwards toward the back seat while vehicle was moving forward<br/>\nwas a problem; reading while car was moving was a problem. And, of<br/>\ncourse, it wasn&#39;t something where an audiobook would do - he wanted to<br/>\nsee the pictures. After much trial, error, and Dramamine :-( I figured a<br/>\nway to hold the book out forward and sideways so it was kind of in front<br/>\nof/slightly above the car stereo, almost but not quite at fully extended<br/>\narm&#39;s length. He could see from the center of the back seat (where his<br/>\ncar seat was located) so it was good for him. And, by having it there, I<br/>\ncould read the words while -also- being able to be looking straight<br/>\nahead out the front window...I was reading mostly with my peripheral<br/>\nvision (given they were stories I had pretty much memorized, it was<br/>\nfairly easy to do). Satisfied him for long enough that he grew into<br/>\nother ways of entertaining himself in the car. Oh, and we had a standing<br/>\nagreement that Mommy got a &#39;break&#39; equal to the length of the book after<br/>\nreading a book (so if it took 15 minutes to read aloud, I got a 15<br/>\nminute break from reading stories before even thinking about another<br/>\none). Now, we&#39;ve got technology - portable DVD player, laptop, with car<br/>\nadapters (and our pickup has auxiliary power ports so we don&#39;t have to<br/>\nuse the cigarette lighter) - plus he can read to himself or we can<br/>\nlisten to audiobooks (he can handle that better now) or we can listen<br/>\nto/sing along with favorite CDs (like the Spamalot soundtrack).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s kinda weird too - up until I was about 10-12 years old I could read<br/>\nnon-stop in a moving vehicle, no problem. Then, one summer we were<br/>\ndriving from NJ to CT and I was reading in the car as I was coming down<br/>\nwith a nasty flu type bug. Got really sick in transit and ever since I<br/>\njust cannot read in transit - not even in an airplane (of course, on<br/>\nairplanes I&#39;m already dosed with Dramamine but I still get eyestrain<br/>\ndiscomfort anyhow).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
