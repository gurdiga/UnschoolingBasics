The kids can talk to their friends anytime their friends are on-line.  And we have to travel to see their friends that live close enough, and stay in a hotel to do it.  My husband and I have been discussing the need to travel even further abroad now that they have on-line friends so far away.  Pretty soon we will need to get in an airplane instead of in a car!    It&#39;s hard to get together with other families because everyone is busy doing their own thing!  I guess that&#39;s why instant messaging is working so well for us--the kids get to tak to their friends without being dependent on me to take them somewhere.
