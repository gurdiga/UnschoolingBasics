I will surely have so many challenges!  I am in a learning<br/>\nstage now, so I have been keeping quiet and this is my first post.<br/>\n<br/>\nA bit about me and th ereason for this first post.<br/>\nMy name is Raquel. I come from rural Northern Spain. I have been living in<br/>\nShanghai,China for the last 8 years and abroad since 1992.<br/>\nAs a child I had an interest about what was going up out there, on the other<br/>\nside of the mountain... and always longed to travel and know new cultures.<br/>\nLearning English changed my life. Through the years, many other worlds and<br/>\nexperiences have been opened to me, in which the acquisition of new<br/>\nlanguages played a key role. For some is music, for others business...I get<br/>\nmy pleasure from listening and understanding other cultures&#39; choices and<br/>\nthoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am currently pregnant with my first child. I have been reading a lot about<br/>\nunschooling and it makes so much sense to me, that I cannot wait for my<br/>\nchild NOT to start school. Language learning has brought much joy in my<br/>\nlife. Being brought up in a remote area in a time where there were no<br/>\nforeigners in my hometown, 2 TV channels and no exposure to foreign<br/>\nlanguages, I was lucky to be pushed into a foreign language by the standard<br/>\nnational curriculum. So when I reflect on my own experience I feel grateful<br/>\nfor having had the chance of going to school. It is difficult for me to<br/>\ngrasp that what worked well on me 25 years ago is  not the best option TODAY<br/>\nfor my future child&#39;s development.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt age 35 I am still looking for my passions (you know I was too busy<br/>\nstudying what I was supposed to be studying during 20+ years so my academic<br/>\nbackground and my passions are definitely NOT in line....working on that<br/>\nnow). One of  my passions is foreign cultures (languages, traditions,<br/>\nbeliefs, religions,...) and the other one is knowing more about how our<br/>\nbrain learns. Taking those into account I decided to follow a master&#39;s<br/>\ndegree in teaching Spanish as a foreign language.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs part of the course I will do a research. This research will help me<br/>\naddress several questions in my mind regarding my future maternity/raising<br/>\nof unschooled children: how do unschoolers learn languages? where is their<br/>\nmotivation coming from? what methods/ means do they use?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have time (where do parents get time from?) please take a few moments<br/>\nto reflect on your child&#39;s foreign language learning by filling up my<br/>\nresearch survey:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=VBmTTsXVMPEKc3PT9FZUBQ_3d_3d\">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=VBmTTsXVMPEKc3PT9FZUBQ_3d_3d</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFell free to send the link to friends who might be willing to share their<br/>\nexperiences with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be posting this link in several unschooling/parenting lists. I hope<br/>\nit is not against the mailing list rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wished I could contribute to the unschooling community now with my<br/>\nresearch and later with my own experiences as a mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany, many thanks for your help.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nRaquel Ramos<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41637,"nextTopicId":41709}}
