My stepson has been enjoying lurking <br/>\nover my shoulder (he gets it from his dad!) and reading posts, and <br/>\nhe was fascinated: &quot;Why the heck would an Adult want to have sex <br/>\nwith a Kid?&quot; Thanks for providing me with an opportunity to chat <br/>\nwith him on the subject! <br/>\n<br/>\nAt his mom&#39;s home his computer use has been somewhat limited - and <br/>\nobviously she hasn&#39;t had a meaningful conversation with him on the <br/>\nsubject. That&#39;s disturbing to me - and I can&#39;t help but wonder how <br/>\nmany other young teens are in the same boat. Its no wonder kids are <br/>\nrunning into problematic situations if no-one is telling them <br/>\nAnything.<br/>\n<br/>\nRay&#39;s gf is in a similar-but-different situation, she&#39;s been <br/>\n*told* &quot;you can&#39;t go on Myspace b/c there are evil people there <br/>\nwaiting to molest children&quot;. Since she knows a dozen kids IRL who <br/>\nhave Myspace accounts, she doesn&#39;t believe a word of it. Mom&#39;s a <br/>\nnutcase, doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s talking about. That may be even <br/>\nworse than not telling a kid anything at all - now there&#39;s no way <br/>\nthis girl will ever tell her mom if she gets into Any kind of <br/>\nsexually threatening situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts so easy to undermine trust and so hard to build it back. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Sometimes its a mild form of intimidation that escalates into a <br/>\n&gt;power play<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So much traditional parenting revolves around this very idea: hold <br/>\nhands or you&#39;ll get hit by a car, brush your teeth or you&#39;ll lose <br/>\nthem, go to school or you&#39;ll be a dummy. Its no wonder kids are <br/>\nvulnerable to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Another tactic is to work to tear down the self-esteem of kids to <br/>\n&gt;make them vulnerable. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This one worries me most, b/c Ray&#39;s had his self-esteem slashed to <br/>\nribbons Already. Last night we were talking about....what the heck <br/>\nwas it...oh, I know! our neighbor Mir was over and made a pun about <br/>\nRay&#39;s name - Rayan//rayon. I could tell Ray was feeling a little <br/>\ndefensive about being compared to a piece of fabric so I <br/>\ndeliberately made a comment along the lines of &quot;well, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nwant you for a table-cloth, but I also don&#39;t thing a piece of fabric <br/>\nis nearly as fun and interesting to talk to as you are&quot;. He was <br/>\nflabergasted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not going to foster his self-esteem to limit his computer use <br/>\nor tell him he&#39;s &quot;too young to know better&quot; though. Nor will it <br/>\nimprove our communication. <br/>\n<br/>\nOops, now my 5yr old is telling me its time to limit *my* computer <br/>\nuse ;) <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, dss Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":171724177,"authorName":"Kelly Weyd","from":"Kelly Weyd &lt;kellmar98@...&gt;","profile":"kellmar98","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] cyberstalking/internet harassment/sexual predators","postDate":"1164470577","msgId":19273,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxMjE2OC4yMTkzNC5xbUB3ZWIzMTQxNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMjUyMDA2MTQ1My4yNzcxNS40NTY4NThENjAwMDFBMThFMDAwMDZDNDMyMjA1ODg2NDQyOUIwRTA1MDE5RDA3MEVAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":19271,"nextInTopic":19279,"prevInTime":19272,"nextInTime":19274,"topicId":19271,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kathryn, Thanks for posting this.

Apparently every segment of the population, of every age and demographic group have been the victim of some form of cyberstalking and/or internet harassment. Sexual predators have a variety of techniques they use to &quot;get&quot; to children that include stalking (following the child to different sites and chat rooms) intimidation, threatening, gaining confidence, posing as someone they are not, etc. These guys are crafty and they dont just show up in a chat room and say &quot;hey meet me at the mall.&quot; Often they will lurk sites and chatrooms for months and quietly gather information about a child and build a &quot;portfolio&quot; of the child well before they even contact the child. It is not difficult to find<br/>\n informatio<br/>\nn on people in cyberspace. Kids have blogs and webpages and cyberpals. They post pictures of their friends on MySpace (or other sites) where the predator can get the email or IM/ICQ screennames of their friends and approach them posing as someone else to get information on the targe child. That is a very common tactic for predators-to get information through other kids. Sexual predators and internet harrassers take time to do what they do.

Another tactic is to work to tear down the self-esteem of kids to make them vulnerable. Sometimes they use the information thay have gained to pose as someone the childs age, and they begin to &quot;mirror&quot; the child&#39;s vocabulary and emotional responses. Through thier internet surveillance activities they learn about something the child likes, and they use it to become someone the child thinks &quot;understands me and is SO much like me!&quot; They can nurture these relationships for a long time before they venture into anything that appears inappropriate. Other times they never reveal their true age and identity and when they finally set up a meeting, the child is met with a grown adult who sexually assaults them. There are also the &quot;harassers,&quot; who have no intention of ever meeting a child, they just send threatening instant messages like this one sent to my friend&#39;s 12 y/o daughter: &quot;Hey ugly bitch, you are so ugly you deserve to be SHOT. I know because I know<br/>\n where y<br/>\nou live and I&#39;ve seen you. You&#39;d better suck my cock when I come over. And then swallow and I&#39;ll let you go.&quot; There are dangerous people trolling the internet. Blocking this guy&#39;s screenname did nothing. He just created a new one and showed up again.
