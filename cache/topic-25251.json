Big muscular movements. <br/>\nYou might want to check out several playgrounds both with the <br/>\nequiptment in mind and also the mix of regular kids. Mo liked to be <br/>\nable to watch other kids do things and then try them herself, so we <br/>\nlooked for playgrounds where there were regular climbers. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf outdoor play isn&#39;t feasible due to weather, look for ways to <br/>\ncreate more opportunities for whole body play indoors - adult <br/>\nexercise equiptment is often good for that just bc of the relative <br/>\nsize difference. Its also possible to get good deals on used <br/>\nequiptment at yardsales and thrift stores. The one thing I&#39;d look <br/>\ninto getting new is a big exercise ball - they&#39;re a blast! Just pick <br/>\nup the legos first ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My 2 year old is really showing signs of possibly being interested <br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; gymnastics.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wanted to comment on this, specifically. Its good to think <br/>\ncritically about this kind of statement. There&#39;s a lot of societal <br/>\npressure to make these kinds of assumptions about younger and <br/>\nyounger kids, but they aren&#39;t realistic and don&#39;t really foster a <br/>\ncloser relationship. There&#39;s a Huge jump in assumptions and <br/>\nexpectations between &quot;active 2yo who likes to climb&quot; and &quot;interested <br/>\nin gymnastics&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it this way...if your 2yo were the type to dash off at <br/>\nany given opportunity, would you say she was &quot;interested in track?&quot; <br/>\nIf she loved to throw, would you say she was &quot;interested in <br/>\nbaseball?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be that you&#39;ve gotten comfortable with the idea of classes <br/>\nfrom your older kids, but a 2yo doesn&#39;t need a class.

She has grace, she can do beautiful<br/>\n&gt; hand and leg <br/>\n&gt; movements in perfect ballet style just like in her<br/>\n&gt; videos (even up <br/>\n&gt; on her toes--I discourage it).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some time ago, I thought, what a great idea for her<br/>\n&gt; to take a <br/>\n&gt; toddler dance class.  She would be able to socialize<br/>\n&gt; with other <br/>\n&gt; toddler&#39;s (she craves interaction) and she could<br/>\n&gt; &quot;learn&quot; more about <br/>\n&gt; the subject that I know basically nothing about. <br/>\n&gt; She was excited <br/>\n&gt; and talked about the class quite often (though &quot;we&quot;<br/>\n&gt; often brought it <br/>\n&gt; up first). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now I am having second thoughts.  Actually, someone<br/>\n&gt; in this group <br/>\n&gt; had said that the classes are highly overrated (when<br/>\n&gt; I casually <br/>\n&gt; mentioned it during a dilemma with the pacifier). <br/>\n&gt; We have already <br/>\n&gt; registered, but the class does not begin until late<br/>\n&gt; August.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My main issue is that I thought the class would be<br/>\n&gt; geared more <br/>\n&gt; toward play (it is called Imagidance).  But, upon<br/>\n&gt; reading the info <br/>\n&gt; at registration I found that parents can only<br/>\n&gt; observe <br/>\n&gt; during &quot;parents week&quot;(three months later) and there<br/>\n&gt; will be a <br/>\n&gt; recital.  Well, I feel like this is more like a real<br/>\n&gt; &quot;class&quot; and my <br/>\n&gt; child will be EXPECTED to perform some sort of a<br/>\n&gt; routine.  This <br/>\n&gt; seems to take away from the fun in my opinion.  She<br/>\n&gt; is only three <br/>\n&gt; and I wonder if this is a lot to ask of her?  I am<br/>\n&gt; guessing that she <br/>\n&gt; will have to stand/sit/pose upon request and since I<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t be there <br/>\n&gt; I won&#39;t be able to observe her reaction to these<br/>\n&gt; requests.  I also <br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t know if the teacher uses manipulation or<br/>\n&gt; whatever else to get <br/>\n&gt; satisfactory results.

What<br/>\n&gt; do you think?  <br/>\n&gt; At this point, do you think I should leave it up to<br/>\n&gt; my child or <br/>\n&gt; should I tell the teacher that something has come up<br/>\n&gt; and tell my <br/>\n&gt; daughter that we will wait until she is older to<br/>\n&gt; take classes? What <br/>\n&gt; if my daughter is adamant about taking the class,<br/>\n&gt; then what?
