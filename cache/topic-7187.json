He also LOVES getting <br/>\nmail.  When he is ready (which I&#39;m guessing would be in the next year or two <br/>\nor three ...), he can write the cards himself and maybe sometime after that, <br/>\nread them.

I don&#39;t know  <br/>\nwhat else, but I bet you can think of something. Also - get him  <br/>\nmagazines, go to &quot;4 wheeler&quot; shows (are there such things?), go to  <br/>\nevents where they are featured, look for documentaries on video, or  <br/>\nwhatever else you can think of..... It doesn&#39;t have to be jumping in  <br/>\nfull board by spending a lot of money.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo show him that you respect his passion, that you take it seriously,  <br/>\nthat it IS important to you that he gets SOME opportunity to pursue it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter was passionate about cats. My husband is ExTREMELY  <br/>\nallergic to them - dangerously so. So, she and I went to cat shows,  <br/>\nwe talked to breeders, we volunteered at a shelter, and she  <br/>\nsubscribed to Cat Fancy magazine for years.
