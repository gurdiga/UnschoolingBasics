I am new to the<br/>\nexperience of unschooling, and when I&#39;m not living and learning with<br/>\nmy only son Tobin (5 1/2), I give people massages, teach music, and<br/>\nalso perform (sing). My dp (partner) Ernie is in construction of all<br/>\nkinds (wishes he could make a living doing alternative construction),<br/>\nplays classical guitar (we perform together), and climbs rocks (guides<br/>\nas well). <br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in the mountains, where there are about 17 other<br/>\nhomeschoolers.  In our community, there is one unschooler (that I know<br/>\nof), who is now in her early 20&#39;s.    Our life is full, and though we<br/>\nwork really hard, we wouldn&#39;t change a thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nCarri Ann, regarging your post about having an only child...my son has<br/>\nhad a playgroup that we have been involved in since he was 2.  It has<br/>\ndwindled way down since most of his buddies are on a school schedule<br/>\nnow.  His social needs are huge, and I often get emotionally<br/>\nexasperated trying to maintain friendships and playdates.  It can be<br/>\ndifficult because we don&#39;t have a learning schedule per say, so we<br/>\noccupy ourselves as best we can until noon when playdates are<br/>\nfeasible.    Some days this works well, and we get involved in various<br/>\nactivities, others he just stares at the clock and disregards any play<br/>\nprompting by me.  (sometimes I just can&#39;t replace the type of play he<br/>\nhas with his buddies).  I vascilate from feeling bad (because he wants<br/>\nnothing to do with me sometimes, and the little girl inside feels<br/>\nhurt) to feeling good that he gets such wonderful one-on-one time with<br/>\nthe person who loves him more than anything in the world!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to learn from discussions on this board, and eventually be able<br/>\nto contribute as I understand unschooling more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183015595,"authorName":"Mother Earth (Tyra)","from":"&quot;Mother Earth &#92;(Tyra&#92;)&quot; &lt;motherspirit@...&gt;","profile":"breastisbesttn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New member intro","postDate":"1133402671","msgId":8039,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMDAwMWM1ZjYxYiRmMDliODEwMCQ2YTAwYThjMEBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTMwMjMyMDI5LjcyMjA3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyNzA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8037,"nextInTopic":9704,"prevInTime":8038,"nextInTime":8040,"topicId":7792,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you, Kathe!

I have been married to Craig for 11 years and we have 2 sons ages 5 and 2 yrs, respectively.  Ren invited me to this group.  Thank you, Ren!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am in a place that I am sure many of you are familiar with:  gaining trust of the unschooling process.  The more I learn and reflect, the more I realize that unschooling is a natural extension of how I have parented my children until this point.  I have always been low pressure with high trust of my children and their needs.  One of my parenting goals has been to do my part to contribute to my children having self-confidence and autonomy.  I feel that unschooling will assist my children in making sure that they feel good about themselves and intuitively follow their inner guidance.  Of course what I want for them is exactly what I struggle with myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the good news is that we are being unschooled together.  I am enjoying exploring our world together but am also learning to relax and trust the process.  I look forward to learning from each of you and am grateful for this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch Love<br/>\nTyra in TN<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9700,"nextTopicId":9710}}
