I met many others whose <br/>\nnames now escape me...plus, I saw lots of old friends (Angel, Joanne, Lisa, <br/>\nto name a few).  And seeing all those children together was truly <br/>\nheartwarming.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter Molly is social in bursts, so the fist 24 hours or so were great <br/>\nfor her, then she was very ready to go home.  I wanted to stay another night <br/>\n(Sunday)...I&#39;m kicking myself now knowing I missed Ren&#39;s famous makeup <br/>\nartistry session!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe talks were so inspiring...the ones I caught were given by Ren, Kelly and <br/>\nBeth.

It was great to meet so many <br/>\npeople I had met here first (Ren, Kelly, Ben, Rue, Tonya (MA), Laura <br/>\n(ME), Carol (ME), Marji (NY))!  My dh attended Ben&#39;s dad&#39;s group <br/>\n(SSUDs - Secret Society of Unschooling Dads) and it was worth the <br/>\nprice of admission just to have him be there for that!<br/>\n<br/>\nI never found Robin (ohpurple) from the Cape, Sarah (ME) who planned <br/>\nto camp at Harold Parker State forest, or Deb Rossing <br/>\n(soggyboysmom) - did you guys make it?   Maybe another time!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd discovered that one of the older teens she met there was <br/>\nsomeone she knew from when she used to take karate and is a life-<br/>\nlong unschooler!  We had no idea!
