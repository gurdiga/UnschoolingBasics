Maybe we are caught in a<br/>\nconstant cycle of deschooling because I try to start each year with<br/>\n&quot;schooly&quot; things, and the kids get sick of it. I know I do! I just<br/>\nfeel like I have to live up to everyone else&#39;s expectations of<br/>\neducation. My parents were both teachers, so I feel like I have to<br/>\nshow them that the kids are actually doing &quot;school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI will try out your suggestions.

I love to read and watch tv with my kids. My<br/>\ndaughter loves horses and takes riding lessons once a week. She plays<br/>\nNeopets, Webkinz, and Howrse online. My son enjoys playing cars,<br/>\narmy guys, cowboys, and video games. He has been diagnosed adhd, but I<br/>\nhave him on no meds. He&#39;s extremely high-spirited and all boy. <br/>\nNeither of the kids have ever been to school. I started out doing the<br/>\ntraditional textbook approach with my daughter, but that QUICKLY fell<br/>\napart. After that we tried about a zillion different things, but we<br/>\nkeep coming back to unschooling. <br/>\nMy question/concern is this. When I look at unschoolers blogs or<br/>\nwebsites, it seems like their kids have all kinds of interests and are<br/>\nconstantly researching and doing &quot;schooly&quot; things on their own. Well<br/>\nmy unschooling days end up being like this: my daughter and I watch<br/>\nGilmore Girls dvds half the day (it would be all day, but we sleep in<br/>\ntill 10 and have breakfast/lunch around 11)and my son plays with his<br/>\ntoys. Both kids do have great imaginations. My daughter does write a<br/>\nlot. Her favorite series is Warriors, and since there is no book out<br/>\nnow, she is writing her own storyline for it. My son draws little<br/>\nshootem up barroom fights, and tells me the whole story for it. <br/>\nI just get nervous and think they will never learn everything they<br/>\nwill need to know if they go to college! My daughter does do math at<br/>\nleast twice a week or more, but my son hates ANY kind of school work.<br/>\nHe just learned to read well in the past year. He reads like 3rd grade<br/>\nreader type books. <br/>\nI know this is long, but I just want to know if other people&#39;s days<br/>\nlook at all like mine. Do your kids just play, use the computer, watch<br/>\ntv all day some/most days? Is this really unschooling or am I just<br/>\nbeing lazy? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much,<br/>\nChristy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30365,"nextTopicId":30356}}
