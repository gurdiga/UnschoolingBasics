Unfortunately we so want to give kids all the  <br/>\n&gt; advantages that the stories of people who are grateful they were  <br/>\n&gt; pushed, the times when our kids find happiness in something we pushed  <br/>\n&gt; them into, loom larger than the far more common stories of people who  <br/>\n&gt; avoid what they were pushed through.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How many people were forced through 12 years of math and hate it? How  <br/>\n&gt; many love it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, are the only two options pushing while praying or not pushing?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No. But this is a slippery slope because helping kids past the humps  <br/>\n&gt; can end up being pushing. So, the first idea to examine is that each  <br/>\n&gt; time we push, we run the risk of the child deciding they need someone  <br/>\n&gt; else to push them, that they can&#39;t move past the difficulties on  <br/>\n&gt; their own.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It will be also helpful to keep in mind that you could be wrong. It  <br/>\n&gt; might be the worst thing for that child. And you&#39;ll be helping your  <br/>\n&gt; child with another life skill by letting them assess and decide if  <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s right. Each time they decide, they learn a bit more about  <br/>\n&gt; themselves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, with that in mind, I&#39;d talk it over with the child. *Don&#39;t* begin  <br/>\n&gt; with the idea of convincing them they should let you push them since  <br/>\n&gt; you feel it&#39;s a good idea for them. Listen to them. How do they feel  <br/>\n&gt; with they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mom pushed her to try a 4-H horse competition which the kid found  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; she rather liked after doing it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And while she pursued that she was not pursuing something else. Maybe  <br/>\n&gt; the other things would have been something she liked even better. Or  <br/>\n&gt; not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The point is that there are a million choices we can make, a million  <br/>\n&gt; things we could get interested in. Everytime we focus on one, there&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; nearly a million others we&#39;re not choosing. We can&#39;t ever know we&#39;ve  <br/>\n&gt; found the ultimate, best thing. But having the freedom to choose and  <br/>\n&gt; explore is even better than certaint.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mom says she wouldn&#39;t have so much knowledge about horses now and  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t have found out she enjoyed such a class if she hadn&#39;t been  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; pushed a bit to do it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The daughter might even agree. But the most important thing is the  <br/>\n&gt; mother is deciding on the value and that the pushing yielded  <br/>\n&gt; something the mom values.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The focus should be on the child. What does the child want? We know  <br/>\n&gt; less what the child wants, less about who the child is -- the child  <br/>\n&gt; knows less! -- the less we listen and the more we push.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My daughter Kat&#39;s a very good distance runner and loves running. She  <br/>\n&gt; joined the school cross country team. My husband loves running too  <br/>\n&gt; and was on the same team when he was in high school. He loves  <br/>\n&gt; competition. Not one of those rabid beat &#39;em types, but he gets  <br/>\n&gt; jazzed setting up goals for himself. He tried to help her train to  <br/>\n&gt; beat the cream of the crop. (Not a huge stretch since she&#39;s a natural  <br/>\n&gt; at it.) At first she enjoyed it. But as she continued, she started to  <br/>\n&gt; realize the goal of beating someone (and the possibility of failure)  <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t float her boat. She just loved to run. It was hard for Carl to  <br/>\n&gt; even grasp the idea of not caring about competing and there was a lot  <br/>\n&gt; of strain until he finally accepted that someone could have great  <br/>\n&gt; talent but want to do something other than what he&#39;d do with it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; She feels it&#39;s human nature to go the easy route instead of trying  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; things that are tough.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s human nature to avoid what we feel is a waste of time, energy  <br/>\n&gt; and resources.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s also human nature to pour energy into what we find fascinating.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If someone is made to climb a mountain, they&#39;ll find the easiest  <br/>\n&gt; path, and perhaps even cheat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If someone desires to climb a mountain, they may even make it more  <br/>\n&gt; difficult -- challenging -- for themselves if the route doesn&#39;t light  <br/>\n&gt; their fire.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If it were human nature to go the easy route, I wouldn&#39;t be sitting  <br/>\n&gt; here writing out a response! No one would write a novel. No one would  <br/>\n&gt; climb Mt. Everest. No one would bake a cherry pie from scratch. No  <br/>\n&gt; one would have kids ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; She said when she was growing up maybe if someone had pushed her  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; more to take tougher science classes, she would have become a vet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s much easier to blame others for our failures than to accept  <br/>\n&gt; responsibility.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That sounds harsh and judgmental. It&#39;s meant as a universal truth.  <br/>\n&gt; When we decide we aren&#39;t capable of something and feel that we can&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; accomplish something unless someone else uses their power over us to  <br/>\n&gt; make us, we can absolve ourselves of failure. It&#39;s not our fault we  <br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t doing x. It&#39;s other people&#39;s fault for not pushing us, or not  <br/>\n&gt; clearing the way for us.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A far more useful life skill for kids is knowing they can do whatever  <br/>\n&gt; they set their minds to. That trumps a knowledge of horses or guitar  <br/>\n&gt; skills or ability to spell or whatever someone&#39;s personal need is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While it would be *easier* if her parents had pressured science on  <br/>\n&gt; her. (*And* she had liked it.) Now, not being a vet isn&#39;t their  <br/>\n&gt; responsibility. It&#39;s hers. She&#39;d be living the idea that you can do  <br/>\n&gt; anything you put your mind to if she decided to become  a vet right  <br/>\n&gt; now rather than modeling that you can blame your failures on others.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For a shy child, it would be far more valuable for mom to help her  <br/>\n&gt; find ways the daughter can use to get past the humps to do the things  <br/>\n&gt; the daughter wants to do. If the daughter gets the idea she needs the  <br/>\n&gt; mom to push her, she could end up at 20+ wishing her mom had pushed  <br/>\n&gt; her in science so she could be a vet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; She knows of people who perused the college catalogues, saying  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hmm, what are the easiest classes to take.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When college is seen as another hoop they&#39;re pressured to jump  <br/>\n&gt; through, why wouldn&#39;t they choose the easiest route?

I was involved in theater/music from a young age (6 or so) and in plays/musicals/ensembles/choirs/show choirs/madrigals all through my elementary-middle-high-school years and college.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was fortunate that my parents paid for me to attend theater camps and take voice lessons...but they never insisted I practice, or pushed me hard to &quot;make the most of my talent&quot;.  They always said I could be whatever I wanted to be -- but that life&#39;s too short to not enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a time, in my early 20s, shortly after college (where I got a concentration in theater) when I wasn&#39;t sure what I wanted to do with my life and I felt that maybe if my parents had pushed me more I would have done more with my talent...gone on to get an MFA, been on Broadway, etc...but as I think on it, I realize that I would have just ended up resenting them and stepping away from theater and music.  I realize now that if I had gone that route (MFA, Broadway, whatever) I wouldn&#39;t have discovered my other passion for libraries & become a librarian (currently not a working librarian...but still...)  I also wouldn&#39;t have met my wonderful husband and become mother to Sabine and Vivian.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusic/performing is still a big part of my life, I&#39;ve done it professionally and just for fun -- but knowing that it&#39;s MY choice, and that I&#39;m doing it because I enjoy it (not because my parents expect it since they paid for classes to help me follow my interest) makes it all the more fulfilling and special.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd who says I still can&#39;t go on to get my MFA/be on Broadway?

Unfortunately we so want to give kids all the  <br/>\nadvantages that the stories of people who are grateful they were  <br/>\npushed, the times when our kids find happiness in something we pushed  <br/>\nthem into, loom larger than the far more common stories of people who  <br/>\navoid what they were pushed through.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many people were forced through 12 years of math and hate it? How  <br/>\nmany love it?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, are the only two options pushing while praying or not pushing?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo. But this is a slippery slope because helping kids past the humps  <br/>\ncan end up being pushing. So, the first idea to examine is that each  <br/>\ntime we push, we run the risk of the child deciding they need someone  <br/>\nelse to push them, that they can&#39;t move past the difficulties on  <br/>\ntheir own.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be also helpful to keep in mind that you could be wrong. It  <br/>\nmight be the worst thing for that child. And you&#39;ll be helping your  <br/>\nchild with another life skill by letting them assess and decide if  <br/>\nit&#39;s right. Each time they decide, they learn a bit more about  <br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, with that in mind, I&#39;d talk it over with the child. *Don&#39;t* begin  <br/>\nwith the idea of convincing them they should let you push them since  <br/>\nyou feel it&#39;s a good idea for them.

Maybe  <br/>\nthe other things would have been something she liked even better. Or  <br/>\nnot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that there are a million choices we can make, a million  <br/>\nthings we could get interested in. Everytime we focus on one, there&#39;s  <br/>\nnearly a million others we&#39;re not choosing. We can&#39;t ever know we&#39;ve  <br/>\nfound the ultimate, best thing.

But the most important thing is the  <br/>\nmother is deciding on the value and that the pushing yielded  <br/>\nsomething the mom values.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe focus should be on the child. What does the child want? We know  <br/>\nless what the child wants, less about who the child is -- the child  <br/>\nknows less! -- the less we listen and the more we push.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter Kat&#39;s a very good distance runner and loves running. She  <br/>\njoined the school cross country team. My husband loves running too  <br/>\nand was on the same team when he was in high school. He loves  <br/>\ncompetition. Not one of those rabid beat &#39;em types, but he gets  <br/>\njazzed setting up goals for himself. He tried to help her train to  <br/>\nbeat the cream of the crop. (Not a huge stretch since she&#39;s a natural  <br/>\nat it.) At first she enjoyed it. But as she continued, she started to  <br/>\nrealize the goal of beating someone (and the possibility of failure)  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t float her boat. She just loved to run. It was hard for Carl to  <br/>\neven grasp the idea of not caring about competing and there was a lot  <br/>\nof strain until he finally accepted that someone could have great  <br/>\ntalent but want to do something other than what he&#39;d do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She feels it&#39;s human nature to go the easy route instead of trying  <br/>\n&gt; things that are tough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s human nature to avoid what we feel is a waste of time, energy  <br/>\nand resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also human nature to pour energy into what we find fascinating.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone is made to climb a mountain, they&#39;ll find the easiest  <br/>\npath, and perhaps even cheat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone desires to climb a mountain, they may even make it more  <br/>\ndifficult -- challenging -- for themselves if the route doesn&#39;t light  <br/>\ntheir fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were human nature to go the easy route, I wouldn&#39;t be sitting  <br/>\nhere writing out a response! No one would write a novel. No one would  <br/>\nclimb Mt. Everest. No one would bake a cherry pie from scratch. No  <br/>\none would have kids ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She said when she was growing up maybe if someone had pushed her  <br/>\n&gt; more to take tougher science classes, she would have become a vet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s much easier to blame others for our failures than to accept  <br/>\nresponsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds harsh and judgmental. It&#39;s meant as a universal truth.  <br/>\nWhen we decide we aren&#39;t capable of something and feel that we can&#39;t  <br/>\naccomplish something unless someone else uses their power over us to  <br/>\nmake us, we can absolve ourselves of failure. It&#39;s not our fault we  <br/>\naren&#39;t doing x. It&#39;s other people&#39;s fault for not pushing us, or not  <br/>\nclearing the way for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nA far more useful life skill for kids is knowing they can do whatever  <br/>\nthey set their minds to. That trumps a knowledge of horses or guitar  <br/>\nskills or ability to spell or whatever someone&#39;s personal need is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it would be *easier* if her parents had pressured science on  <br/>\nher. (*And* she had liked it.) Now, not being a vet isn&#39;t their  <br/>\nresponsibility. It&#39;s hers. She&#39;d be living the idea that you can do  <br/>\nanything you put your mind to if she decided to become  a vet right  <br/>\nnow rather than modeling that you can blame your failures on others.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a shy child, it would be far more valuable for mom to help her  <br/>\nfind ways the daughter can use to get past the humps to do the things  <br/>\nthe daughter wants to do. If the daughter gets the idea she needs the  <br/>\nmom to push her, she could end up at 20+ wishing her mom had pushed  <br/>\nher in science so she could be a vet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She knows of people who perused the college catalogues, saying  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Hmm, what are the easiest classes to take.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When college is seen as another hoop they&#39;re pressured to jump  <br/>\nthrough, why wouldn&#39;t they choose the easiest route?
