Not sure if she&#39;s old enough to be really considered unschooling, but as I understand it kids with special needs today are often involved in early intervention programs almost from day one.  In that sense, I guess a child of any age could be an unschooler.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I wish I could remember that Mom&#39;s name -- her kids&#39; are named Wheatley (boy, 9?) and Victoria (4, with Downs).  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nFinding fabulous fares is fun.<br/>\nLet Yahoo!
