They very <br/>\nopenly advertise a bunch of different things in a lump while talking about <br/>\nhow the local t.v. access channel Wayne&#39;s World isn&#39;t willing to sell out to <br/>\nadvertise a video game arcade. They do it in the second movie as well, but <br/>\nnot as much. We watched Men in Black last night and there is a scene where <br/>\nthese little aliens are leaving and they are pulling a bunch of Marlboro <br/>\ncigarettes with them. Everybody noticed the product placement.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk alot about what&#39;s on television, and sometimes that means talking <br/>\nabout television as an ad. But really that&#39;s not what keeps Simon and <br/>\nLinnaea from succumbing to &quot;predatory&quot; advertisement. It&#39;s having a full and <br/>\nrich and happy life that doesn&#39;t leave them feeling needy or unfulfilled. <br/>\nThe reason why television ads work, or why children can be lured away by <br/>\nsexual predators on the internet, is because they are offering some image of <br/>\nlife, of happiness, that the child is unable to fulfill in their own lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My point about tv is that it&#39;s ALL advertising -even the programmes.<br/>\n&gt; We are the product that is being bought whether we buy a something or<br/>\n&gt; not. It is like buying billboard space in our homes. They are buying<br/>\n&gt; access to us. It is only because advertisers. product placers, and<br/>\n&gt; corporations pay for tv that it even exists. You don&#39;t have to buy<br/>\n&gt; their stuff to be the product, all you have to do is watch. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25252,"nextTopicId":25285}}
