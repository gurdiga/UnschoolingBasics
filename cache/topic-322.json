Any ideas<br/>\nwould be greatly appreciated.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, here are my thoughts:<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly if it such a horrible big job for you, no wonder it is overwhelming<br/>\nfor her. I think you are kinda abandoning her to a task that is too big for<br/>\nher - maybe always was too big. She needs help. Try to let go of your &quot;teach<br/>\nher responsibility&quot; agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I do with Jayn&#39;s small playroom - which can get absolutely full<br/>\nand unusable very quickly. I ask her if she is done with the game (usually<br/>\nBarbie&#39;s), so that I can put it away. Then I put it away in the very<br/>\norganized system of canvas boxes that I have created to facilitate the clean<br/>\nups and storage. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do the same with the games that Jayn spreads out in the living room, and<br/>\nin the bedroom. I do the same when her art table becomes overrun with<br/>\npartially completed projects and tools. I put away the clothes that she<br/>\ntends to dump on the floor in her quest to get at her clothes in her drawers<br/>\nimmediately after. (This latter I sometime grumble a bit about - although I<br/>\ndo the same for my dh&#39;s clothes and laundry - and part of the problem is<br/>\npoor drawer organization. She wouldn&#39;t need to drop stuff if she could see<br/>\nher stuff more easily)<br/>\n<br/>\nThese swift clean ups are my gift to Jayn - the gift of a clean slate. I do<br/>\nthem often so that they are not too time consuming for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason, of being busy with other stuff, her room had been left for<br/>\na long time last week, and the same phenomenon of not playing in there had<br/>\noccurred. I just bit the bullet and took the extra time to tidy it and she<br/>\nwas really grateful. I also took the opportunity to move Jayn&#39;s art table<br/>\nout of her room and back to the living room - the reverse placement was an<br/>\nexperiment that failed to make her life easier. The result has been non-stop<br/>\nart creation for the two days that it has been back accessible.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently she has started spontaneously putting some things away by herself.<br/>\nShe has also started helping me with the clean ups, especially when things<br/>\nhave gotten out of hand in the living room. Other times she continues to<br/>\nplay while I tidy up - we are still spending time together both being happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have posted before about the lovely moments when Jayn has given us the<br/>\nsweet gift of a surprise bed make or grocery bag empty or jumped up to take<br/>\nmy plate to the kitchen. Yesterday she got out a fresh toilet roll on her<br/>\nown recognizance. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a problem with bits of small plastic that hold the straws onto<br/>\njuice boxes. I was forever finding them on the floor all over the house. I<br/>\ntold Jayn that it was hard for me to be bending and asked for her<br/>\nsuggestions. She said that she would bring them to me, and now she does -<br/>\nalmost always. One less little bit of mess to worry about. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing is that if I truly don&#39;t want to do a big clean up, I give<br/>\nmyself permission not to at that time, and do it when I feel energetic.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice therefore is to cheerfully clean up her room before it gets out of<br/>\nhand. Enjoy her being in there keeping you company. If it continues to bug<br/>\nyou that you are working while she plays, then do it while she is busy<br/>\nelsewhere.

We are unschooling little by little as I learn about it and try to<br/>\nincorporate it into our days.  Our homeschooling up to this point has been <br/>\nmostly reading to her and reading to her and reading to her, and following <br/>\nher interests as far as she wants to take them.  I have learned (the hard <br/>\nway) that she will learn what she wants, when she wants, and as deep as she <br/>\nwants and I just need to help her when she wants help and not &quot;teach&quot; her. <br/>\nMy 3 year old son is following the same pattern of being his own person and <br/>\nnot so much doing what I say, but taking what I say as advice and doing what <br/>\nhe thinks is right.  I was just like this as a child (still am) so of course <br/>\nmy mom is just laughing and laughing at my trials.  I think that the kids <br/>\ninsistence on being treated with respect and not talked down to or ordered <br/>\nabout is pretty neat and it&#39;s teaching me to be a better person and to treat <br/>\nmy kids like the real people that they are.<br/>\n      My question has to do with Natalie cleaning her room.  I used to ask <br/>\nher to do chores in the morning.  She had one chore a day, and on Mondays <br/>\nand Fridays her chore was to straighten out her room. I have since stopped <br/>\ntrying to schedule her to do chores, and just ask her to help out when I <br/>\nneed some help.  I told her that she was in charge of her room and that I <br/>\nwould not be asking her to clean it 2 days a week anymore.  If she wanted it <br/>\nclean, she could clean it and if she didn&#39;t want it clean she did not have <br/>\nto clean it.  That was about a month ago.  Her room is now<br/>\nshin deep in clothes, toys, scraps of paper, tape, etc...I have no problem <br/>\nwith this.  She has been having fun creating stuff and playing in there. The <br/>\nproblem is that now she doesn&#39;t like playing in there anymore because there <br/>\nis so much stuff on the floor she can&#39;t move.  She came up to me and asked <br/>\nme to help her clean her room.  In the past this has not worked for us.  It <br/>\nstarts with her helping (picking up the clothes while I pick up the books) <br/>\nand devolves into her playing while I do all the work.  I end up getting <br/>\nangry about the huge mess, her lack of help and just sending her out of the <br/>\nroom so I can finish it quicker.  How can I change this to better reflect an <br/>\nunschooling attitude?  I don&#39;t want to shield her from the consequences of <br/>\nher actions, but I also hate to see her faced with this mountainous task.  I <br/>\nwas thinking that maybe I could help her clean as long as she was cleaning <br/>\nalso (and not playing).  That means I end up watching her while I&#39;m cleaning <br/>\nand judging her cleaning to see if it&#39;s up to my standards or if I need to <br/>\nstop helping because she is no longer cleaning like I think she should be <br/>\ncleaning.  Yuck.  So far I have been too busy to do anything about her room. <br/>\nNatalie has asked me several times when we can clean it and I have told her <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure.  When she comes up to me asking for something to do because <br/>\nshe is bored I tell her she can pick up the clothes in her room.  This <br/>\nusually sets off a pouting spree about how hard it is and how she does not <br/>\nwant to and I tell not to do it if she does not want to.  Any ideas would be <br/>\ngreatly appreciated.<br/>\nThank you<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":169847153,"authorName":"blessed54321@wmconnect.com","from":"blessed54321@...","profile":"blessed543212003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Intro and question","postDate":"1091303684","msgId":2402,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEzLjVmNmZjZTBhLjJlM2Q1MzA0QHdtY29ubmVjdC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2401,"nextInTopic":8195,"prevInTime":2401,"nextInTime":2403,"topicId":322,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/31/2004 11:25:01 AM Central Daylight Time, ... nance,,i appreciate your ramble,,,its how i end up getting my point out,,quiet for a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-155057791\">In a message dated 7/31/2004 11:25:01 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marbleface@...\">marbleface@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been interrupted a bunch of times here and it probably shows in my long <br/>\n&gt; ramble -- but you get the idea. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nance<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>nance,,i appreciate your ramble,,,its how i end up getting my point <br/>\nout,,quiet for a while,,and a subject strikes me as &#39;&#39;i have something to say about <br/>\nthat&#39;&#39;,,,,i am some concerned,,because i want the best for my kids,,,public <br/>\nschool isnt it ,,,not right now anyway,,,local vo-tech,,worked well for my older <br/>\ntwo when the time for it come,,,but until then,,we will learn,,and live ,,and <br/>\nthe stress that my 15yr.old son would experience,,wont be there,,and the clics <br/>\nand such my daughter would have to deal with wont be there either,,they are <br/>\nbright ,,laid back,,wonderful kids,,,im glad to have this time with <br/>\nthem,,although i could use the income from a job,,,we make do pretty well,,,most weeks <br/>\n,,the week before s.s.d,comes inis tight to be sure,,but they are happy,,and soami <br/>\n,,,any ideas for at home work??between hubby&#39;s bipolar,,and <br/>\nmed.changes,,homeschooling,,,not much outside the house work time....June<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"nanceconfer","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Intro and question","postDate":"1091288219","msgId":2401,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzMxMTUzNjU5LlJPUTE3ODguaW1mMjJhZWMubWFpbC5iZWxsc291dGgubmV0QG1haWwuYmVsbHNvdXRoLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":696,"nextInTopic":2402,"prevInTime":2400,"nextInTime":2402,"topicId":322,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter is also 9 1/2.

How did she learn to read? Not like her brother, of course -- that would have been too easy. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, she lives in a house with lots of books. And magazines. Etc. Bought and ordered specifically for her. She has chosen mostly nature/animal themed mags so far. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she got a library card. Long before she could actually read. I wonder if the way we go to the library is how other people do it. We walk in and I go to my section (murder mysteries :) ) and DD browses in the kids&#39; section until she finds what she wants. Yesterday it was a DVD. Last time it was a book and a DVD. The time before just a book. She is reading the Animal Ark series and enjoying it a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy job at the library is to have the library card ready when she is ready to check out. To notice what she selected and admire it and then get in the car and drive us home.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, at one point (she was 6) she specifically said &quot;everyone but me knows how to read&quot; and demanded to be taught using some sort of organized plan. Together we chose the 100 Easy Lessons book and she did about the middle third of it and that solidified her reading enough that she then went to picking out her own books, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe learned to spell south yesterday. We just switched to bellsouth. :) Spelling things correctly is helpful when you are trying to do anything -- like Google a question or find a book in the library or solve a puzzle -- last week one of her mags had a puzzle that involved alphabetizing some animals to solve it -- the punchline was so corny it was a real groaner -- but she amazed me that she even knew HOW to alphabetize a long list of things :). But, really, when you thnk about it, the idea is pretty obvious -- she just hadn&#39;t had it put in front of her as a &quot;worksheet&quot; -- it was something she wanted to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my long ramble is just to say -- it&#39;s OK. Relax. Maybe my DS won&#39;t win any spelling bees. But she reads a lot. Maybe she&#39;s not reading what all the other 9 year old girls are reading in our county. But that&#39;s OK. It&#39;s not a race. It&#39;s not a competition. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could have worried a lot about her not reading early -- that was the example I had in her brother. But I had started to try to relax about all this stuff by then and she got it when she was ready. And continues to grab a book as a way to relax.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe may have to dash down to babysit her 2-year-old cousin when my SIL has the new baby. So what did we make sure we had packed in our &quot;maybe we&#39;ll have to stay overnight&quot; bag -- a book for each of us of course! That&#39;s what you do when you have free time -- you read something for fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s more a lifestyle thing than a &quot;what grade level are you on, are you keeping up&quot; thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, take her brother -- the early reader. You won&#39;t catch him with a book, no sir! Not fiction anyway. He just doesn&#39;t get into it. Now, give him a good logic puzzle book and he&#39;ll be happy. Should I get upset that he isn&#39;t immersed in whatever 11 yo boy popular fiction is these days? <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think so. Not when you see them. I shouldn&#39;t be upset that they aren&#39;t &quot;on grade level&quot; in any way. Yesterday included an outing to help DS&#39;s Tae Kwon Do teacher lay some tile in his new school. (DH is a tile/marble guy.) In the background, my two kids were running and box balling and having fun with the other kids and what more can I really want? They are just clearly so happy! <br/>\n<br/>\nThen the lady who is a black belt and an artist came up and we talked and she asked about the hsing, how it works, etc. &quot;No, we don&#39;t test, don&#39;t use a curric, what we do is called unschooling. We learn as things come up and as we become interested. Etc.&quot; (You&#39;ll develop you&#39;re own spiel as you unschool. :) ) The lady explained that if she ever has children she wouldn&#39;t want to send them to school. She was bullied in school (artistic type even then :) ) and thinks it sounds great to hs but thought it was much more regulated, etc. She was happily surprised. But she knows my son. She&#39;s seen him and talked with him for years. And she knows he&#39;s a great kid. She really got how this relaxed sort of lifestyle is working for him! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this is all just to say my family may not be anything like yours. But that&#39;s OK. Even within our family there are big differences in interests and rates of learning and what age people do what -- and it&#39;s all OK. We don&#39;t measure ourselves by what the Florida Sunshine State Standards say the kids should be doing (although I did at one time!). We don&#39;t compare our kids to yours or the neighbor&#39;s. We try to avoid comparing them even to each other -- even when they do, we point out that it&#39;s not a real thing -- to compare one person&#39;s interest/ability in one area to another person&#39;s passion. It doesn&#39;t make sense. To say she draws better and he&#39;s quick on a math joke -- it just doesn&#39;t bear comparison. So why would a comparison to some list put out in our state&#39;s capitol make any sense? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve gone on too long but I know this is all difficult and it is hard to relax and just know that something like reading can&#39;t be forced. When you just know it is such an important tool in the world. But it will come. It will. When it is needed. And if your DD can ask you for help when she needs to, so much the better. Rather than shutting down because she feels a particular book or whatever is being forced on her -- if it&#39;s her own curiosity about something that leads her to need to be able to read about it -- what a lovely thing to discover and own! <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been interrupted a bunch of times here and it probably shows in my long ramble -- but you get the idea. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n============================================================<br/>\nMy biggest concern with a less <br/>\nstructured approach to <br/>\nhomeschooling is that she&#39;ll never learn to read or spell.  There are <br/>\nso many ways to avoid <br/>\nthose things -- books on tape, TV/videos, etc. that she could be very <br/>\nfunctional for a long <br/>\ntime without &quot;needing&quot; to read. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny feedback would be appreciated.

I am so thrilled to have found this list (Thanks, Mike!!!).

I&#39;ve known since before I had kids that I wanted to unschool with them, and Carson has come to home/unschooling gradually over the years.

I think that two main things are at work here - he is very physical and probably doesn&#39;t get enough puppy-type play, and his personality combined with the years of previous coercion have him still living with a &quot;I have to do it my way and only my way&quot; attitude which keeps him from hearing what we&#39;re saying when we let him know he&#39;s hurting us.

If I tell <br/>\nhim what I&#39;m planning to do, or doing, or ask him to read something, <br/>\nhe resists (I&#39;m talking about philosophies here, not going to the <br/>\npark). He does, however, notice what works. It takes much longer than <br/>\nI would like, but he&#39;s been moving in the right direction. Also, when <br/>\nI have &quot;solid evidence&quot; that something is working, I make a big deal <br/>\nof it--in a very joyful &quot;isn&#39;t it great&quot; way, not &quot;I told you so.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nEasiest example is that Mikey has a tendency to give up quickly if <br/>\ntrying something new, especially if it&#39;s physical. I rarely pushed <br/>\nhim to take his own clothes off or put them on, but it was hard to <br/>\nstay quiet when we really thought he could do it and he&#39;d make a big <br/>\ndeal about how hard it was. Now, at 3.5, when we come home from <br/>\nsomewhere he takes his shoes off, puts them away in the hall closet <br/>\nand closes the door. I told dh that if Mikey does that at 3.5 without <br/>\nus pushing or teaching or anything other than doing it for him, I <br/>\ncan&#39;t bring myself to worry when he claims he &quot;can&#39;t&quot; do something. <br/>\nThat was a turning point for my dh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI reserve the right to vent when he doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; on any given day!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I never actually introduced myself. I&#39;m AJ, tired mom (didn&#39;t <br/>\nrealize how late it had gotten...my dd woke up twice while I&#39;ve been <br/>\nwriting) to Mikey who&#39;s 3.5 and talks like he&#39;s about...85, I think <br/>\nand Caroline (aka Coo-Coo), almost 18 months. She&#39;s a very determined <br/>\ngirl who can do anything she sets her mind to and who frightens me on <br/>\nan hourly basis. Right now she&#39;s really into dogs so I&#39;ve been <br/>\nturning on dog shows on TV a lot, playing with a neighbor&#39;s dogs and <br/>\ntrying to figure out what else to do! Suggestions welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nMikey is a huuuuge Thomas fan. He doesn&#39;t know it yet, but we&#39;ll be <br/>\nriding on the big Thomas in Strasburg, PA in a couple weeks. <br/>\n<br/>\nI gotta get some sleep! Happy to be here with you all!<br/>\n<br/>\n--aj</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8238,"nextTopicId":8305}}
