It is an open-ended game, where a<br/>\nplayer can live a separate life with little preset plot or mandatory<br/>\ntasks. There are, also, certain tasks which players can choose to<br/>\ncomplete, and goals they can choose to achieve. The game is played out<br/>\nin real-time - observing days, weeks, months, and even years - 29,<br/>\naccording to Nintendo- using the GameCube&#39;s internal clock. There are<br/>\nmany actual events and holidays spanning the year, including<br/>\nIndependence Day, Halloween, and Thanksgiving, among others. Other<br/>\nregular activities such as early morning fitness classes and fishing<br/>\ntournaments are included in the game as well. Some players purposely<br/>\nadjust the clock to skip forward or backward in time, a practice known<br/>\nas &quot;time traveling.&quot; Other players use cheat codes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds very unschooling to me; I have not played it myself, though I saw<br/>\na kid (about seven) play it who liked it a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne positive review on it as used by a four year old (although with the<br/>\nparent helping too, why not try, you might like it too?):<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rendergaming.blogspot.com/2004_10_01_archive.html\">http://rendergaming.blogspot.com/2004_10_01_archive.html</a><br/>\nFrom there: &quot;For the last six days, my wife, daughter, and I have been<br/>\ncompletely hooked on the game. Animal Crossing&#39;s allure is hard to<br/>\ndescribe. It&#39;s a game (if you can call it that) about simple<br/>\npleasures--collecting seashells, fishing, picking fruit, chatting with<br/>\nyour neighbors, et cetera. It has no conflict to speak of, no tension,<br/>\nand no &quot;save the universe&quot;-type goal. It has no plot. It lacks the<br/>\ngodlike control system and complex customizations options of the Sims.<br/>\nIt&#39;s Hello-Kitty cute and you can play it for hours on end, every day.<br/>\nNeedless to say, the game&#39;s been a big hit. More on Animal Crossing<br/>\nlater. I have to go pry the controller from my wife&#39;s hands and force<br/>\nher to eat, sleep, and bathe.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general I think when a family plays media (TV or games) together,<br/>\nsome of the bad aspects of them go away. The previous review cited also<br/>\nspeaks highly of another game -- although clearly played together with<br/>\nparent and child. From there: &quot;A week or so ago I finished the Legend of<br/>\nZelda: The Windwaker, bringing an end to a truly sublime gaming<br/>\nexperience. Windwaker is one of those rare games that leaves you with a<br/>\ndeep affection for its characters and a real sense of accomplishment. My<br/>\nexperience with the game was made especially enjoyable by the fact that<br/>\nmy four-year old daughter, a true fairy tale devotee, was equally<br/>\nentranced by its story and characters. Over the last couple of months,<br/>\nwe&#39;ve had a lot of fun playing Windwaker together, and I believe that<br/>\nLink, Tetra, Tingle, and the rest of the Windwaker cast have earned a<br/>\nplace in her imagination equal to that held by the Disney Princesses.&quot; A<br/>\nlink for that:<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zelda.com/gcn/\">http://www.zelda.com/gcn/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; series is also another possibility, though again<br/>\naimed at an older audience.<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_%28series%29\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_%28series%29</a><br/>\nFrom there: &quot;Most Harvest Moon games are permutations of a central<br/>\nformula. The game generally takes place over a set period of time<br/>\n(generally 3 years), in which the player is charged with the task of<br/>\nrunning a successful farm, getting married, having a child, and becoming<br/>\nfriends with the townsfolk. Most gameplay in the Harvest Moon games<br/>\nconsists of planting seeds to grow fruits and vegetables in the spring,<br/>\nsummer, and autumn, and collecting items, making home improvements, and<br/>\nbuilding personal relationships in the winter. A successful farmer must<br/>\nweigh the cost, selling price, number of harvests, and growth times of<br/>\nthe various types of produce in order to pick the best product for each<br/>\nof the seasons. The player must also balance their physical resources;<br/>\nif players over-exert themselves, they might not have the energy to<br/>\nperform needed activities, or might even get sick and miss a day of<br/>\nfarming.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have played one of that series &quot;Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland&quot; on<br/>\nthe PS2 and liked it a lot and think a young child would also like it<br/>\n(though I have not see a young child play it, or seen the specific<br/>\nversions for the GameCube). You need to be able to read for some of<br/>\nthem, in which case, a parent or babysitter would need to play it with a<br/>\nyoung child.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor pure addictive non-violent arcade action, &quot;Super Bust-A-Move&quot; is<br/>\nnice, with very simple controls, but not sure if a four year old would<br/>\ntake to it (or should :-).<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gamecube.gamezone.com/gamesell/p20849.htm\">http://gamecube.gamezone.com/gamesell/p20849.htm</a><br/>\nOn the redeeming side, I do think that does teach some 2D problem<br/>\nsolving skills though. My wife liked it a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also suggest some of the Dancing Games like DDR could be worth while<br/>\nfor both your kids. They involve a mat where you have to make the right<br/>\ndance moves.<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ddrgame.com/\">http://www.ddrgame.com/</a><br/>\nA review here recommending one version for age five and up, perhaps if<br/>\nyour youngest is near a birthday?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.parenting.com/parenting/child/article/0,19840,1180502_3,00.html\">http://www.parenting.com/parenting/child/article/0,19840,1180502_3,00.html</a><br/>\n&quot;Best for young kids (5 and up) is Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix; it<br/>\nfollows the cartoon character Mario as he tries to retrieve his lost<br/>\nMusic Keys, which will restore peace — and rhythm — to the people of the<br/>\nMushroom Kingdom. Kids are challenged to dance in sync with a song as<br/>\nthe right moves flash on the screen.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, with the Nintendo Wii out,<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wii.nintendo.com/\">http://wii.nintendo.com/</a><br/>\nwith its unusual controller which requires arm movement and encourages<br/>\ngetting off the couch to get a little exercise,<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote</a><br/>\nif your kids do play computer games, getting a Wii might be worth the<br/>\ninvestment in the near future for the health of your kids overall if you<br/>\ncan possibly afford it (it also plays GameCube games and can use those<br/>\ncontrollers). Your kids are literally going to spend hundreds to<br/>\nthousands of hours with these games; so why not get them something that<br/>\nkeeps them physically active too?  Most of the top titles seemed pitched<br/>\nat older kids though (7+):<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-lists/Wii-Titles.html#RLists\">http://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-lists/Wii-Titles.html#RLists</a><br/>\nThey do come with some sports games that are supposed to be fun for the<br/>\nwhole family.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might ask yourself why your four year old needs to play the games<br/>\nalone?  Could a deeper issue be not so much finding a good game, but<br/>\ninstead somehow finding more help with babysitting or perhaps an in-home<br/>\n&quot;mother&#39;s helper&quot; (like a twelve year old neighbor starting out on a<br/>\nbabysitting career?) while you are off doing other things around the<br/>\nhouse or just to get more time for yourself? Everyone needs such time;<br/>\nif you just want the game as a babysitter, then there are other<br/>\nalternatives -- some people get it at places like the YMCA which often<br/>\noffer free childcare while parents use the facilities (though Y&#39;s cost<br/>\nsomething monthly, typically $60 or so). If on the other hand, it&#39;s just<br/>\nbecause you don&#39;t think video games are for you or you can&#39;t do certain<br/>\nones of them well (you mention that), one can see from the above links<br/>\nthat playing a game together can be quite enjoyable if it is the right<br/>\ngame for the two of you, and there are ones that bridge the gap between<br/>\nfour year old and adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an adult, you don&#39;t have to be intimidated by many of these games. My<br/>\nwife and I used to be, seeing young relatives buzzing around these<br/>\ngames, until we got a PS2 for ourselves while in our late thirties and<br/>\nfound it not that hard to learn how to use -- especially after we came<br/>\nto understand every game has a unique use of most of the controls, and<br/>\nlearning that is part of the game. (I can&#39;t imagine us having the time<br/>\nto play any of these games to conclusion as just a couple now, of<br/>\ncourse; each typically takes thirty to forty hours or so.) Still, we<br/>\ncould see that some games require hand-eye coordination and speed which<br/>\nseemed almost beyond us; those we too generally give up on, and we<br/>\nlearned to be more and more selective and read more and more reviews<br/>\nbefore investing our *time* in a game. The ones I have listed are not in<br/>\nthat demanding category though. (Some others we like as adults, are<br/>\n&quot;Ico&quot;,  and &quot;A Dog&#39;s Life&quot;, though PS2 only, and not sure about for a<br/>\nyoung kid. And then there is any sort of racing game, like Gran Turismo<br/>\n(again for the PS2). There is also &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, which we<br/>\nplayed on the PS2 but is also available for the GameCube -- but it is<br/>\ndefinitely for older kids -- you sneak around taking pictures of evil<br/>\ndoings related to a conspiracy, and it has a catchy soundtrack too.)<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://snarfed.org/space/Beyond%20Good%20&%20Evil%20soundtrack\">http://snarfed.org/space/Beyond%20Good%20&%20Evil%20soundtrack</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDespite liking console games and the occasional good DVD movie<br/>\nourselves, we&#39;re still keeping our almost four year old away from TV,<br/>\nconsole games, and most of computers (we say TVs are an older form of<br/>\ncomputers which don&#39;t work that well, and only sneak some DVDs<br/>\noccasionally on a laptop when he is asleep. :-). Our child does have at<br/>\nhis occasional request perhaps a half-hour of computer time once per<br/>\nweek or so with a parent driving a web browser. This is mostly looking<br/>\nat Google images for pictures of things (excavators or firetrucks usually),<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=excavators\">http://images.google.com/images?q=excavators</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=firetrucks\">http://images.google.com/images?q=firetrucks</a><br/>\nThese heavy machinery accidents (no one hurt) are fun for a moment too:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://humour.200ok.com.au/image_misc-bad-days.html\">http://humour.200ok.com.au/image_misc-bad-days.html</a><br/>\nA big current interest is &quot;Bagger 288&quot;, which is probably the largest<br/>\nmobile excavator in the world:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=bagger%20288\">http://images.google.com/images?q=bagger%20288</a><br/>\n(You can see in a few images what happened when a full size bulldozer<br/>\ngets in its way. :-)<br/>\nAnother good web site is Google maps,<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps\">http://maps.google.com/maps</a><br/>\nwhere we zoom around to our house or some other places we know (use the<br/>\nsatellite view or hybrid view). These are all ways of our young child<br/>\nseeing the real world through using the computer as a sort of telescope.<br/>\nThese activities would not have been easily possible even just a few<br/>\nyears ago. Our child also plays some of the &quot;Bob The Builder&quot; online<br/>\ngames and looks sometimes at the &quot;Thomas The Tank Engine&quot; sites. We<br/>\nbought books for some of the standard kid shows including Dora the<br/>\nExplorer, too; doesn&#39;t know they are on TV. :-)  So, if you have<br/>\nbroadband internet, and are willing to do the driving, there is a lot a<br/>\nyoung kid might want to look at just using Google Images, Google Maps,<br/>\nand a few selected sites, like:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bobthebuilder.com\">http://www.bobthebuilder.com</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thomasandfriends.com\">http://www.thomasandfriends.com</a><br/>\nSince both parents program computers at home, it would be too hard and<br/>\nconfusing to not let our child use computers at all too (otherwise I<br/>\nmight consider it :-), but we still don&#39;t really encourage it. My wife<br/>\nhad also written him a very simple drawing program when he was two which<br/>\nhe played with for fifteen minutes at a time once every couple of weeks<br/>\nway back then (mostly drawing colored lines and placing letters randomly<br/>\non the screen); the key idea being for him to get a sense of what his<br/>\nparents do and that software could be changed and customized. When he is<br/>\na little older, I&#39;ll be tempted to drag out an old Commodore 64 or<br/>\nVIC-20 (if anything still works) and put a Forth cartridge on it and let<br/>\nhim learn to program his own things. :-)<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://akaimbatman.intelligentblogger.com/wordpress/archives/42\">http://akaimbatman.intelligentblogger.com/wordpress/archives/42</a><br/>\nBut if that old hardware doesn&#39;t work, apparently GNU/Linux has been<br/>\nported to the GameCube, so that could be another possibility: :-)<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Main_Page\">http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Main_Page</a><br/>\n(but that is probably not a good idea to try for non-programmers. :-)<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Screenshots\">http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Screenshots</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe based this decision to not do much with media at a young age (and<br/>\nthen, only with fairly slow moving media) on, among other things, the<br/>\nresearch by Dimitri Christakis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://research.seattlechildrens.org/about/feat_research/harnessing_technology_for_the_benefit_of_children.asp\">http://research.seattlechildrens.org/about/feat_research/harnessing_technology_for_the_benefit_of_children.asp</a><br/>\non how rapidly moving discontinuous images in media may rewire the brain<br/>\nat a young age (baby through toddler) to crave such constant high levels<br/>\nof visual stimulation. See for example newspaper articles on his work:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/educate/college/healthscience/articles/20040411.htm\">http://www.usatoday.com/educate/college/healthscience/articles/20040411.htm</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sptimes.com/2004/04/05/Worldandnation/Toddlers__TV_habits_m.shtml\">http://www.sptimes.com/2004/04/05/Worldandnation/Toddlers__TV_habits_m.shtml</a><br/>\nOne can read the research results one of two ways. Rapid images at an<br/>\nearly age are bad (because it is blocks out other more important play<br/>\nand interferes with usual brain growth), as exemplified by this quote<br/>\nfrom the USA Today article: &quot;Every added hour of watching TV increased a<br/>\nchild&#39;s odds of having attention problems by about 10%&quot;.<br/>\nOr, you can interpret the findings that early media exposure is good,<br/>\nbecause it leads to a new sort of intelligence, a &quot;homo sapiens medias&quot;<br/>\nif you will :-) as exemplified by this quote from the same article: &quot;The<br/>\nchange isn&#39;t necessarily bad, Los Angeles media psychologist Stuart<br/>\nFischoff says. As media exposure grows, &quot;these kids could be expressing<br/>\n&#39;the new brain.&#39; They could be an advance guard that suggests we may<br/>\nneed new ways of teaching children exposed to a lot of media stimulation.&quot;&quot;<br/>\nPersonally, we&#39;ll let someone else&#39;s kids be the guinea pigs. :-)<br/>\nWe have chosen to go down one path in regard to early media; the reality<br/>\nis most people are choosing the other (or slipping into it unawares).<br/>\nEven if the &quot;new brain&quot; becomes dominant, we think there will be some<br/>\nvalue for our child in being in the US minority wired the old way. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way, one can&#39;t equate the implications of watching, say, the best<br/>\nthing on TV IMHO, Mr. Rogers&#39; Neighborhood,<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fci.org/MRN.asp\">http://www.fci.org/MRN.asp</a><br/>\nwhich is slow paced with few scene changes per minute and has great<br/>\ncontent on emotional self-understanding presented in a caring way, to<br/>\nfast paced media (games or TV) with changes of scene and viewpoint every<br/>\nfew seconds often revolving around violent solutions to conflicts. TV,<br/>\nespecially children&#39;s TV, is not the same sort of thing most current<br/>\nparents experienced when growing up. Only time will tell what the full<br/>\nimplications are (if any). Same too with video games as they get more<br/>\nand more realistic. By the way, you can often get older video games like<br/>\nPacMan etc. as either stand-alone TV plugin devices<br/>\n  &quot;Atari Flashback&quot;<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Flashback_2\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Flashback_2</a><br/>\nor as retro game collections for newer consoles (PS2 example:)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/arcades-greatest-hits-the-atari-collection-2\">http://www.mobygames.com/game/arcades-greatest-hits-the-atari-collection-2</a><br/>\nor sometimes even as complete remakes, like PacMan for GameCube:<br/>\n   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.the-nextlevel.com/reviews/gamecube/pacman_vs/\">http://www.the-nextlevel.com/reviews/gamecube/pacman_vs/</a><br/>\nSo if there are any games you liked as a teenager, you might be able to<br/>\nfind them and share them with your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, between TV and games, I would think the games might be somewhat<br/>\nless of an issue because the kid is somewhat in control of the scene<br/>\nchanges in an interactive way and kid games tend to be continuous<br/>\nscrolling of some sort like by traveling somehow (which the brain is set<br/>\nup to deal with already). Also, unlike TV, most games tend to be<br/>\nself-limiting, since kids only stay in an enjoyable sense of &quot;flow&quot;:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(</a>psychology)<br/>\nas long as their growing skills match the growing challenge level -- and<br/>\nat some point most games run out of ever increasing challenges and so<br/>\nstart to become become boring (online games like WoW being somewhat of<br/>\nan exception since they better reflect the real world of endless variety<br/>\nof new social relationships and such.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easier to essentially completely restrict media at a young age with<br/>\nan only child, such as ours, especially if the parents also don&#39;t watch<br/>\nTV or play games much anymore. If a younger kid sees an older kid (or<br/>\nparent) in the family using the TV or a computer game, I&#39;m sure it is<br/>\nhard to say &quot;wait till you are older&quot;. If I were getting my child a<br/>\nconsole game at age four (who knows, sooner or later I&#39;m sure we will),<br/>\nit would be at first something like one of those I listed. From what I<br/>\nhave read of various consoles (we have only a PS2, in storage), the<br/>\nGameCube seems like the best choice for young children, although I think<br/>\nthe Wii make sense too, and it plays GameCube games, so it is now IMHO<br/>\nthe ideal entry console for families who chose to introduce computer<br/>\ngames and don&#39;t already have a console. (We long ago gave up on PC games<br/>\nas we had endless install problems and they messed up the configurations<br/>\nfor other important programs, plus we moved to GNU/Linux and the Mac.)<br/>\nAt an older age, you can also provide them with some help to write their<br/>\nown games, and there are a variety of software packages for that<br/>\n(another long topic, barely touched on above). And if my child was<br/>\nwatching TV (and sooner or later, we will), I would pick stuff like Mr.<br/>\nRogers&#39; Neighborhood purchased on DVD at first, as well as old time kids<br/>\nshows (1960s/1970s-ish Green Acres, Mr. Ed, Thunderbirds, etc. which are<br/>\nslower paced and generally available on DVD; plus I would not mind<br/>\nseeing them again). If we had broadcast cable (we don&#39;t), I would get a<br/>\nTivo-like device and program it to collect such shows. And in an ideal<br/>\nworld, we would play the games and watch the TV together and also have<br/>\ngreat on-call in-house childcare (but good help is always hard to find. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best in finding the right solutions for your child and family.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Paul Fernhout<br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Does anyone know a good game for the gamecube that is easy enough for <br/>\n&gt; my 4 yr old to play alone.<br/>\n&gt; He can only get so far on madagascar, starwars2, shamu, and we have a <br/>\n&gt; couple mario bros. and he is so frustrated.<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t get far either and my older son is not always around to help.<br/>\n&gt; We have leapster and leappad, but he wants to do gamecube.<br/>\n&gt; TIA   <br/>\n&gt; Laurie </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7644358,"authorName":"Kidgie@aol.com","from":"Kidgie@...","profile":"mama_de_julian_y_julia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] help w/ gamecube for 4 yr old","postDate":"1182820414","msgId":24702,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJkNS4xMTFiMzdjNi4zM2IxYzIzZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24701,"nextInTopic":24710,"prevInTime":24701,"nextInTime":24706,"topicId":24701,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/25/2007 5:02:22 P.M.

It&#39;s not an amazing game by ANY means, but it&#39;s  <br/>\nsimple and fun and good to help the eye hand coordination. Julian is now really  <br/>\npretty good at Super Mario 3...hey, what about Mario Kart? That was an earlier  <br/>\ngame for him too, and he did quite well on the first few tracks. We also play  <br/>\nBurn Out, lol...which took some getting used to and letting go for me (it&#39;s a <br/>\n car crashing game, that&#39;s the point to crash and stuff) But Mario Kart might <br/>\nbe  a good one. Also, Tetris is fun if he enjoys puzzles. Dr. Mario is <br/>\nsimilar to  Tetris, so that&#39;s another option there, too. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m glad you asked, because we are looking for good games here, too. <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":270129302,"authorName":"Laurie","from":"&quot;Laurie&quot; &lt;seaglasshearts@...&gt;","profile":"seaglassheart5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"help w/ gamecube for 4 yr old","postDate":"1182815853","msgId":24701,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1cGtwZCtqZ3UxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24702,"prevInTime":24700,"nextInTime":24702,"topicId":24701,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Does anyone know a good game for the gamecube that is easy enough for my 4 yr old to play alone.
