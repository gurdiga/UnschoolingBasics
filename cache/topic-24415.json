We&#39;ve also introduced a new segment by Ren Allen--&quot;I-Tribe&quot;--in <br/>\nwhich she offers creative inspiration and challenges as a spin-off of <br/>\nher yahoo group, Imagination Tribe.<br/>\n<br/>\nArticles in this issue discuss topics like the benefits of late reading, <br/>\nthe joys of learning without school, the importance of family stories, <br/>\nand even how one unschooling mom helps her child pursue learning and <br/>\nautonomy despite the law. Our feature author this month along with <br/>\nLaurie Chancey is Sarah Briand, who treats readers to an insightful and <br/>\ninspiring look at unschooling transformation and process in her article, <br/>\n&quot;The Dragonfly.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a heavy heart I&#39;m also announcing today that we&#39;ll be saying <br/>\ngoodbye this issue to Anne Ohman, whose column &quot;Oh How We Shine!&quot; has <br/>\nbeen inspirational to so many of us over the past year. Anne will be <br/>\nleaving us to walk forward in the direction of new opportunities and <br/>\nadventures, and we wish her the best of luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (9), Julia (8), Sam (7)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com\">http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\nConnections: ezine of unschooling and mindful parenting<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://connections.organiclearning.org\">http://connections.organiclearning.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24403,"nextTopicId":24424}}
