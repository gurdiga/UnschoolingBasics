I feel the need to connect with<br/>\nother unschoolers, to be inspired and to get support.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of you might remember me from WAY back when there were message<br/>\nboards at unschooling.com.  I posted a few times at unschooling.info but<br/>\nhaven&#39;t done much posting anywhere for the last year or two.   I&#39;m<br/>\nHeather Hongslo (the one who usually had tons of questions)  from Alaska<br/>\nand I have 3 kids, Tanner 10, Hunter 7 1/2 and Haley 5.    I recognize<br/>\nmany of the names on posts here so hi everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be truthful...I&#39;m not sure what I have been doing.  Most days lately<br/>\nit seems like we are totally unschooling.  We are doing interesting<br/>\nthings, living our lives, kids are learning...doing...playing...   A few<br/>\nyears ago I thought I finally got unschooling but the last few years we<br/>\nhad craziness going on with selling our house, moving, having a home<br/>\nbuilt and moving again.  I pretty much did nothing with the kids.  Sure<br/>\nthey learned first hand about putting a house up for sale and all the<br/>\nthings that go into building a house but we had hardly any time for<br/>\nanything else, or I didn&#39;t feel up to anything else because those were<br/>\nstressful times.<br/>\n<br/>\nTanner had to have state assessments for the past 2 years and both times<br/>\npassed Below Proficiency.    (He is required to take the testing so we<br/>\ncan get an allotment each year.)  So because I had my issues and<br/>\ndoubts...Last fall I ordered some curriculum(ugh!)  but that was short<br/>\nlived when I realized what a mistake I had made and put most of it away.<br/>\nHunter loved the Phonics Set and for awhile we played with that every<br/>\nday...but the rest was a big waste of money from my parental panic<br/>\nattack!   I feel I am horribly failing because I should have presented<br/>\nTanner different opportunities or ways to grasp the things he&#39;d be<br/>\ntested on.   He hasn&#39;t been able to grasp different concepts because he<br/>\nhas never had the need to grasp them or they haven&#39;t come up for him in<br/>\nhis life.  I feel that is my fault.  Some of my stress I feel on this is<br/>\nbecause when I&#39;m around other homeschoolers I feel like I am not doing<br/>\nenough compared to them.  I know I shouldn&#39;t compare myself to them or<br/>\nmy kids to their kids but it makes me wonder...and then all the what ifs<br/>\ncome up.   My dh seems to think testing results matter more than I do so<br/>\nthat has caused a little stress for me.  Although my dh doesn&#39;t put me<br/>\nto blame he just thinks we need to do more with Tanner.  Which I agree.<br/>\nBut I want to do it in a way that is something fun, exciting, something<br/>\nTanner wants to do on his own not because we are telling him to do<br/>\nsomething...basically in an unschooling sort of way.  I&#39;m looking for<br/>\nideas on spelling and writing.  I&#39;ve read over and over that spelling<br/>\nand writing happens from reading.  Tanner doesn&#39;t like to read on his<br/>\nown.   He however likes me to read to him and for now that is what I<br/>\nhave been doing.  Actually... I have been doing this for years with<br/>\nTanner.   Patiently waiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it is not Tanner.  Maybe it is me.  Maybe I need to get rid of all<br/>\nmy doubts, concerns, issues.  I guess as I am writing this I am getting<br/>\nsome of my answers.  Still I&#39;d love to get some responses, ideas,<br/>\nsuggestions...sorry I got this so long for my first posting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14533,"nextTopicId":14606}}
