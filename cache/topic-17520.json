What creative ways are there to <br/>\nstart saying &quot;yes&quot; to yourself?  Are there some prerequisites you can <br/>\ntake at your local community college?  Online courses you can take?  <br/>\nPortfolio requirements you can start to assemble?  Savings you can <br/>\nstart?  Start working on it now--when I started flamenco it was just one <br/>\nhour per week and although i reeeeeallly wanted to do more I still had a <br/>\nsmall toddler and not enough money for more.  Slowly I got to do more <br/>\nand more as the opportunities arose, and while I still don&#39;t do it as <br/>\noften as I&#39;d like, I am still slowly learning more and more.  Start <br/>\nnow!  I can so totally see you at RISD someday.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17445,"nextTopicId":17521}}
