Go for it!&quot; Or are you <br/>\nquietly letting up on the controls?<br/>\n<br/>\nOften littluns are jarred and have no basis for handling that much <br/>\nfreedom if it&#39;s new. E-e-e-a-a-a-s-s-s-e-e-e into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggest to your husband that he should take one deeep breath before he <br/>\nanswers. That will give him an extra few seconds to *think* about what <br/>\nhe&#39;s refusing to allow and give him a few seconds to ponder *why*.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour children are young. Are you helping them settle down for the night <br/>\n(warm bath, dim lights, foot rubs, songs/stories)? or just letting them <br/>\nstay up until they crash?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for sex, it needn&#39;t happen at night---or in the bed! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis should be the place.
