For<br/>\nexample, This American Life broadcast a wonderfully nuanced collection<br/>\nof real people stories on our personal choices about rules and how we<br/>\nhurt ourselves and others, yesterday morning on PRI.  It is titled<br/>\n&quot;Ruining It for the Rest of Us&quot; -- one applies this principle to an<br/>\nissue unschoolers know well, the anti-vax dilemma for individuals and<br/>\nsociety.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/podcast/370.mp3\">http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/podcast/370.mp3</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThen the last story of the hour relates to the legalistic,<br/>\nrule-following mindset of the &quot;Quiet Car&quot; concept on northeast Amtrak<br/>\ntrains.  The whole program is worth listening to just for this<br/>\nprogression of one woman&#39;s thoughts as she rides in the car week after<br/>\nweek and sees the self-righteous passengers (especially herself) as a<br/>\nmicrocosm of society legalistically trying to make each other follow<br/>\nthe morally superior rules they&#39;ve all agreed to!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother story is about research on three behavior types that &quot;ruin it<br/>\nfor the rest of us&quot; whatever the focus, in school or at work, in<br/>\nsocial groups and in society at large -- the attacker-insulter, the<br/>\noff-task slacker and the depressive-pessimist.  Basically the worst<br/>\nteam member affects the way everyone in the group winds up treating<br/>\neach other. It&#39;s contagious. I think this insight is most useful when<br/>\nwe turn it on ourselves (am I the bad apple?) rather than judging and<br/>\nattacking others for it -- which just makes things worse for everyone<br/>\n-- and it applies to unschooling issues and unschooling discussions as<br/>\nmuch as any.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe researcher&#39;s next project is testing the hypothesis that one group<br/>\nleader can change that dynamic simply by asking questions and<br/>\nlistening for real understanding to the answers, almost like talk<br/>\ntherapy, so others experience that too, instead of just feeling<br/>\nill-used by the bad apple -- the idea is that this can defuse bad<br/>\nbehaviors, sort of inoculate the group against catching the poison<br/>\neffects.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I would suggest that beyond &quot;information&quot; on laws and models<br/>\nso desperately behind the curve that we all know it isn&#39;t working and<br/>\ncan&#39;t be sustained without reform (like schooling!)  we can look<br/>\nforward instead, imagine new solutions that can be legal and moral and<br/>\npractical, models that will actually WORK after the revolution!
