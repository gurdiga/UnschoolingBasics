There are plenty of things that aren&#39;t my favorite <br/>\nactivities, but I choose them because I like the activity better <br/>\nthan the consequence. There is still choice involved.<br/>\nI doubt the child that was &quot;dawdling&quot; (probably not wanting to go <br/>\nsomewhere he was forced to go) really chose to go to school in <br/>\npj&#39;s. &quot;Natural consequences&quot; is really just punishment in disguise.<br/>\nTrue natural consequences happen all on their own. The natural <br/>\nconsequence of not eating is being hungry. The  natural consequence <br/>\nof my spending too much money is I&#39;ll have less.<br/>\nMaking a child go to school in pajamas is more about the parent <br/>\nmaking a point in my opinion. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m not here to find fault with your choices...truly.<br/>\nI was simply pointing out that it wasn&#39;t a good example of how <br/>\nunschooling works, or how we use unschooling philosophies to assist <br/>\nour parenting choices.<br/>\nA criticism of information is not a criticism of you as a parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone is using a school example to explain unschooling <br/>\nphilosophies, I&#39;m going to question that at my list. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping my child safe from impending danger IS my job as a mother. <br/>\nThat does not mean I use &quot;natural consequences&quot; to try and teach <br/>\nthem a lesson. Real life consequences will happen. But my children <br/>\ntrust me to help them when they need to get ready, to not force them <br/>\nto do things they don&#39;t want to do and to keep them healthy and safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever your choices were in the past, or whatever your parenting <br/>\nsituation, I believe you (just as myself) did the best you could at <br/>\nthe time. That doesn&#39;t mean we did great, we just did our best.<br/>\nHopefully our best keeps getting better.<br/>\nI can certainly look back and see where I made tremendous mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that at an unschooling list, we could admit that sending a <br/>\nchild anywhere in clothing they didn&#39;t want to be seen in, is not <br/>\nthe most respectful choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2934,"nextTopicId":2941}}
