You say he agrees that kids learn best when <br/>\nthey&#39;re interested and that public school is not the best place to <br/>\nlearn. That&#39;s great! He may never get it 100%, but as long as he <br/>\nrespects your choices, all is good. <br/>\nThat&#39;s great that your conversation did a lot to reassure you. I <br/>\nfind that myself also.
