We \r<br/>\nhave been deschooling since July..Before July we were doing school at \r<br/>\nhome/unit studies and that sort of thing. Very structured , very \r<br/>\norganized...it was horriable. It was like we were all going against \r<br/>\nthe grain of what we truly wanted and needed to do. It sucked and our \r<br/>\nhouse was full to the brim with resentment, anger and fustration from \r<br/>\nevery angle....my poor hubby coming home from work must have wanted \r<br/>\nto stay away....*sigh*...remebering back...everything was such a \r<br/>\nfight...going to bed was a fight, eating was a fight...sitting down \r<br/>\nwas a fight...going out to play was a fight...It was \r<br/>\nhorriable...anyway I am sure you understand where I am coming \r<br/>\nfrom..and I share this simply becuase I wanted to give you all some \r<br/>\nbackground. We went to unschooling out of pure exhaustion on \r<br/>\neveryones parts and it was the best descion we ever made for our \r<br/>\nfamily..though we are def still in the deschool mode...were getting \r<br/>\nthere...sooooo uesterday was amazing...We woke up together after \r<br/>\ncuddling in bed for about 2 hours...we all got our brekkie...The \r<br/>\noldest helped me get everyone together...we sat and ate \r<br/>\ntogether...watched the snow...it was a gorgeous morning out...I \r<br/>\njumped on the net to check my email, Ash(5yo)went to play zelda on \r<br/>\nthe gamecube, Tyler(8yo) was off doing all sorts of different things \r<br/>\nand Heather(3yo) was playing house with the Guinea Pigs. It was \r<br/>\nreally calm...THEN the fun really begain...my son came down deciding \r<br/>\nhe wanted a job...He didt want a paper route or anything that other \r<br/>\npeople do...so he came up with dog walking! He sat at the computer \r<br/>\nand made posters , figuring out how to put them together with \r<br/>\npictures and everything, how much to charge (he came up with 5 bucks \r<br/>\nan hour), his phone number (which I didnt even know he knew!) and \r<br/>\nprinted them out...he took them around our condo taping them up...he \r<br/>\nwas so excited...upon returning home he decided that he had to have \r<br/>\nsome kind of page that he could write everything down , so he got out \r<br/>\na notebook and wrote down name, date, name of dog, unit you live in, \r<br/>\ntimes....it was amazing to see...I helped him come up with a few more \r<br/>\nquestions like temperment of the dog, that sort of thing. It was \r<br/>\ngreat! He then sat there thinking, and asked &quot;what happens when I get \r<br/>\nto many dogs&quot;..I jsut sort of said, I am not sure..what do you \r<br/>\nthink...he said..I need empolyees..lol...I walked in on \r<br/>\nhim &quot;interviewing&quot; three of the neighbourhood kids , one of them \r<br/>\nbeing his sister...It was the cutest thing...It was neat too because \r<br/>\nhe was telling his &quot;employees&quot; that he was going to get paid 5.00 an \r<br/>\nhour so he would give them half which would be 2.50 an hour and if \r<br/>\nthey only worked for an hour, it would be 1.25! I was blown \r<br/>\naway...where did he learn that!! One of the reasons I wanted to \r<br/>\nhomeschool in the begining was becuase I wanted to know what and how \r<br/>\nmy children were learning....They dont go to school so where did he \r<br/>\nget this stuff? lol..His sister decided that she would do it, IF and \r<br/>\nonly if she got to keep 4.00! He also decided that he was going to \r<br/>\napproach his dad and ask for a loan for his businees, so that he \r<br/>\ncould buy his own leash! lol...it was amazing. He didnt get any calls \r<br/>\nyet, but he is already planning his next business venture.  The way \r<br/>\nhis mind was working, it really made me see that he truly has a \r<br/>\nbusiness mind...thats what makes him tick. To make a great day even \r<br/>\nbetter we went out and played in the snow together....shovled our \r<br/>\nfront walk and driveway, giggled and had a great time. Heather (3yo) \r<br/>\nand I came back in and made hot cocoa and she went down to watch some \r<br/>\nshows...and I got some houswork done...We ended up having some of the \r<br/>\nneighbourhood kids over, and one stayed for dinner. After dinner, the \r<br/>\nkids cleaned the table without being asked...my daughter helped with \r<br/>\ndishes without being asked, and preceeded to tell me stories about \r<br/>\neverything and anything...She is quite the story teller...Back in \r<br/>\njune I wouldnt have &quot;let&quot; her help with dishes I would have told her \r<br/>\nto go find something on her own to do...*sigh*...so we sat and did \r<br/>\ndishes and she told me stories...I listened. It was awesome.  After \r<br/>\nthat was all said and done , the kids sat down and drew pictures \r<br/>\ntogether while I tried to fix our blasted computer (I had to re DL \r<br/>\nwindows XP a few weeks ago and ever since then we don&#39;t have sound. I \r<br/>\nknow we have an onboard soundcard....HELP..LOL). Tyler then went on \r<br/>\nto knitting his wallet he is making. He learnt how to change colours \r<br/>\nyesterday amoungst all the other things we were doing. Very cool. Its \r<br/>\nneat to see him sitting on the floor cross legged in combat pants \r<br/>\nknitting...*smiles*. I gave up on the computer and we decided to play \r<br/>\nmonoply...Tyler (8yo) was the banker, Ashleigh (5yo) was the property \r<br/>\nperson and Heather(3yo) was Heather *smiles*...it was amazing...Tyler \r<br/>\nwas making change like a pro..helping his sisters make it \r<br/>\ntoo...Ashleigh was able to give the right properties to people \r<br/>\nebcuase she organized them by colour and then matched the words on \r<br/>\nthe card to the words on the board..her doing , not mine. Heather \r<br/>\nsorted the money by colour. It was so incrediable...Daddy came home, \r<br/>\nthe game went away. We spent some time talking together while daddy \r<br/>\nate his supper and tried the candy we made two days ago. He loved \r<br/>\nthem both..the kids then dissappeared upstairs and Graham and I sat \r<br/>\nand talked about the property were looking into buying...when we \r<br/>\nlooked at the time it was 10pm, Graham had been up since 4 am and was \r<br/>\nzonked and so was I. We headed upstairs to see what the kids were \r<br/>\ndoing...they were all found in Tylers bed cuddled together sound \r<br/>\nasleep....*sigh*...what a perfect end to an amazing day...and the \r<br/>\nbest thing....my husband then looked at me and said, &quot;you know this \r<br/>\nunschooling thing just might work&quot;. My reply, &quot;I was hoping you would \r<br/>\nsay that&quot; . We might have a long way to go with this deschooling \r<br/>\nprocess, but proof is in the puddin hunny.\r<br/>\nAmoung all of this we had discussions abotu everything from weather, \r<br/>\nfriends, farming, animals, colours...sooo many things...amazing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nhappy were doing this\r<br/>\nP\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS Secondary school education Graduate school education Home<br/>\nschool education \r<br/>\nGraduate school education online High school education Chicago school<br/>\neducation \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYAHOO!
