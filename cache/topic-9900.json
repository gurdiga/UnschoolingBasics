Im on <br/>\na state wide homeschool email group and this post came through and I sit  here <br/>\nin tears.   Curious to hear other views and trying to articulate  a <br/>\nresponse....    a brief background the orginial poster was  asking for help cause her <br/>\ndaughter is getting mouthy and not wanting to  work.  my internal voice is <br/>\nsaying that maybe nonunschooling loops are not  the place for me anymore!  below <br/>\nis the response<br/>\nChrissy<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nHi  ,  I know this sounds harsh but I say  to myself:&quot; is there a PARENT <br/>\nin this house?!?&quot; and I put a foot down. No  mouthyness, not without harsh <br/>\nrepercussions. Once, I had a child that I  didn&#39;t allow to speak for a whole <br/>\nday - not a word.  A couple of  lectures about respect, responsibility, and <br/>\nfuture goals might be in order.  It&#39;s tough being both parent and teacher, <br/>\nbut you owe it to the kid to hang  in there! You can do this!<br/>\nDays like that, I often declared Chore Days. Once  they realize the choice <br/>\nis schoolwork or scrubbing bathrooms, suddenly  essays didn&#39;t look so <br/>\nhard.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9862,"nextTopicId":9902}}
