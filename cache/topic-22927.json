Part of that is convenience for my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-45354362\">We do have set mealtimes in our house, not to the minute, but approximate times in which <br/>\na meal preparation SHOULD be done. Part of that is convenience for my husband, who HAS <br/>\nto be out of the house by a certain time to walk to work, and is usually starving by the <br/>\ntime he gets home. Part of that is convenience for me, because if I tried to set up meal <br/>\ntimes for every single person in the house, we&#39;d have nine different mealtimes. Part of it is <br/>\nconvenience for the children, because they can anticipate a large meal being ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said that, even with set mealtimes, we don&#39;t FORCE the children to sit with us, and <br/>\nwe don&#39;t force them to eat what is prepared by me (although anymore, Josh cooks on <br/>\nWednesdays, and half the time the girls help, so it&#39;s not really &#39;me&#39; anymore). I do ask the <br/>\nchildren to sit with us, as I announce that dinner is ready, because it&#39;s a good time to all <br/>\nsit together and discuss the day (especially in light of dh missing most of it) They are <br/>\nusually amenable, they know that the meal is at the same time every day and have learned <br/>\nto time themselves to end games to join us. They also trust us that if they aren&#39;t ready to <br/>\njoin us, that they can finish what they are doing and join us. They can eat all or part of the <br/>\nmeal that is in front of them, they can choose to reheat a more preferred left-over or <br/>\npreprepared snacks. All-in-all, they love sitting with us, and usually I don&#39;t prepare foods <br/>\nthat are far outside of their acceptance level. :-)  Every once in a while we&#39;ll make <br/>\nsomething with tunafish, and several kids find it revolting and move on quickly. <br/>\nLunch is usually the same, dh walks home from work to eat, and we try to get it on the <br/>\ntable at a certain time so that he doesn&#39;t miss more work than he needs. it is much more <br/>\nlaid back than dinner however, and breakfast is even more relaxed, because Josh and <br/>\nEmily usually sleep much later than the rest of us, usually only dh, Bre, Dan and Sam eat a <br/>\nbig breakfast, the rest of us nonmorning people will reheat an hour or more later, or just <br/>\nhave cereal.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause there are so many of us, and grocery costs could skyrocket very easily, we do <br/>\nhave a calendar that only has meals on it. We have a party the last day of the month, kind <br/>\nof like a monthly mardi gras, where we dig out all the leftovers, all the snacks, fruits and <br/>\njuices. We take stock of what we have, eat what we want, and decide what was good <br/>\nenough to repeat, what new recipes we want to try, and assign a big meal to each day of <br/>\nthe month. Then we make a grocery list and try to buy all of our food for the month. The <br/>\ncalendar isn&#39;t set in stone, but it does make things more convenient and takes a lot of <br/>\ndecision making out of the way, and I always know that I have what I need to make the <br/>\nmeal. We do look at activities for the month, like our weekly potluck I know to make <br/>\nsomething that easily stretches portions more, and on our big playdate days, we always <br/>\nplan either a crockpot dinner or something like nachos. This saves on time, and on energy <br/>\nbecause we&#39;re always tired after a day like that and wanting fast food. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I don&#39;t know if I covered it all or left a big gaping hole that has you scratching <br/>\nyour head. :-)  We do have snacks out all the time, cut fruit, deli meats and cheese, <br/>\ncrackers and candy, so they have access to eat anytime they like. Most of the older ones <br/>\nhave chosen to limit their snacking after i&#39;ve started cooking dinner, because they like <br/>\nwhat we&#39;re making, and want to eat more of it. Most of the younger ones can snack right <br/>\nup til dinner and still eat a good portion of food. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Wildflower Car&quot; &lt;unschoolfool@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am curious how some of you handle food. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you set meal times?
