I know this does go against unschooling but sometimes I really feel we need <br/>\nto do something else.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really REALLY wondering why people seem compelled to give advice they <br/>\nKNOW is anti-unschooling on this list? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of this list is to help people understand unschooling. How does <br/>\nadvice like this help anyone, reader or poster, to better understand <br/>\nunschooling and move toward an unschooling life?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease. Please. Don&#39;t post advice that &quot;does go against unschooling&quot; here. <br/>\nEven if you post a disclaimer. There are THOUSANDS of places for folks to get <br/>\nthat sort of advice. This shouldn&#39;t be one of them. It&#39;s unfair to the members <br/>\nwho&#39;ve come here looking for unschooling advice, and it&#39;s unfair to the <br/>\nlongtime unschooling advocates who will then feel compelled to not only spend time <br/>\nposting unschooling compatible advice but also writing about why the &quot;does go <br/>\nagainst unschooling&quot; advice is a bad idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s okay if people personally decide to follow anti-unschooling practices in <br/>\ntheir own families. I&#39;m just asking folks not to promote practices that are <br/>\nanti-unschooling here. That&#39;s not the purpose of this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\nLife, The Universe, and Everything<br/>\n<br/>\n(my apologies to the list owners)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13073,"nextTopicId":13049}}
