However, I found a company that sold them as a complete set<br/>\nfor much cheaper. Now they are going out of business due to a family<br/>\nemergency and need to sell all of their stock. The Harry Potter kits<br/>\n(which are new and have never been opened) are now 50% off at $10.75<br/>\nfor 11 kits and $18.98 for 13 kits (each kit comes in it&#39;s own<br/>\nenclosed Scholastic envelope). I can&#39;t say enough about these kits.<br/>\nEach one is jam packed with stuff to do and lots of extras! At their<br/>\nwebsite you can look at each kit individually to get an idea of what<br/>\nthey contain. The kits are no longer available, so they are not easy<br/>\nto find. If you want me to bring them to our next meeting, I can do<br/>\nthat, so you can see.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the website:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeandfamily.biz/store/harry-potter-activity-kits-c-22.html\">http://homeandfamily.biz/store/harry-potter-activity-kits-c-22.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTake care!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarla</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37753,"nextTopicId":37752}}
