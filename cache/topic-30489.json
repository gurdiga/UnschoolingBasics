I have a<br/>\nfriend who had the distinction of being the worst case of child abuse<br/>\nin Northern VA history at one point.   He was the second of 3<br/>\nchildren... an older brother and younger sister were never abused (it<br/>\nwas discovered during his adulthood that neither of his &quot;parents&quot; were<br/>\ngenetically linked to him although no adoption records have been<br/>\nfound)    At any rate... he never attended school, at various times in<br/>\nhis life he was made to live in an abandoned barn on the property his<br/>\nfather managed (a large horse farm).   He was abused in so many ways<br/>\nit&#39;s just heartbreaking to even contemplate.   His xrays light up like<br/>\na Christmas tree he has so many breaks and heal overs.   He can tell<br/>\nyou which household chemicals do the least damage when ingested and<br/>\nwhich ones only get worse when water is consumed after them.   He<br/>\nknows how long you can go without food before you pass out and lots of<br/>\nother horribly useful things if you are being tortured!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that said... he ended up in foster care at age 17 when he snapped<br/>\nand almost killed his father during an episode of abuse.    He was put<br/>\ninto a school program and basically completed an entire school career<br/>\nand got a high school diploma in just a few years then went on to<br/>\ncollege and did very well.     I have had many conversations with him<br/>\nabout his past because it just amazes me that he developed at all.  <br/>\nHe said he played alot of math and logic games in his head...<br/>\nevidently he had learned to count at some point (perhaps as a toddler<br/>\nbefore the abuse began?)   he was able to take that simple skill and<br/>\nalthough he didnt know what it was called he learned to add, subtract,<br/>\nmultiply and divide just by knowing how to count.  So my thought is<br/>\nthat there are very minimal &quot;math&quot; type things that really HAVE to be<br/>\ntaught to develop those type of neural pathways.  His main deficit was<br/>\nlanguage... he had made up lots of names for things because he didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow what they were really called but basically he made his own<br/>\nlanguage so in all actuality language was not a weakness English was!<br/>\n  He of course has all the emotional baggage, lots of sensory issues<br/>\nand so forth (you should have seen him the first time he tasted Pepsi!<br/>\n)    Anyway he&#39;s quite a neat person to know ... and he assures my<br/>\nchildren that he WAS raised in a barn but doesn&#39;t leave doors open!   <br/>\nAnyway just thought you would find that interesting!<br/>\nLisa Blocker <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; A child left out in nature with no human interaction might not develop<br/>\n&gt; those neural pathways...but maybe they would. Because there has been<br/>\n&gt; some evidence of feral children learning all sorts of things nobody<br/>\n&gt; thought they could learn after they were found. Not great evidence<br/>\n&gt; there, because in most of those cases the scientists turned the poor<br/>\n&gt; child into a case study and they never had a normal family life which<br/>\n&gt; would give us a better look at just what neural pathways HAD formed<br/>\n&gt; without a healthy start.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think we don&#39;t really know the mysteries of the brain. I believe<br/>\n&gt; wholeheartedly that in a nourishing family all the neural pathways a<br/>\n&gt; person needs will develop just fine.

The term &quot;forced<br/>\nlearning&quot; is such a hilarious oxymoron- like it could be justified!) is that<br/>\nit&#39;s too painful.  Can you imagine, in our culture that promotes guilt, how<br/>\nit would feel for most people to come to the horrifying realization of the<br/>\nunnecessary pain inflicted upon them as children?  And the pain of knowing<br/>\nthey have done, or are doing the same thing to their own children? (or, in<br/>\nthe case of many teachers, other people&#39;s children)?  So painful, in fact,<br/>\nthat their minds cannot see it.  Their minds will continue to create excuses<br/>\nto justify their experience.    That&#39;s the cycle of abuse, isn&#39;t it?  How<br/>\noften do you hear adults say that they &quot;deserved&quot; to be hit or punished in<br/>\nsome other way when they were children?

I  <br/>\nasked him, since one of his passions is how the brain works. This is  <br/>\nwhat he wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t have anything that specifically deals with skip counting (I&#39;m  <br/>\nassuming she&#39;s talking about counting by 2s or 5s) or multiplication.  <br/>\nBut, if you read the book &#39;The Brain That Changes Itself&#39; (and watch  <br/>\n&#39;The Brain Fitness Program&#39; that was on PBS tonight), it pretty much  <br/>\nsays that any talk about how our brains are hardwired at any point in  <br/>\nlife is not true. The research mentioned in the book talks about how  <br/>\nwe can learn pretty much anything at any time in our lives, and that  <br/>\nour brains are extremely plastic. Again, it doesn&#39;t talk specifically  <br/>\nabout counting and multiplication, but that was certainly my take-away  <br/>\nfrom the research discussed in the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, in about 5 minutes during an Inner Speed Secrets seminar,  <br/>\nI&#39;ve coached a middle-aged man to count backwards from 100 by 7s.
