I know people who were so deeply involved in Civil War<br/>\nrecreation that they decorated their whole house like a mini-anetebellum<br/>\nmansion.  And I&#39;ve known people who were so fascinated with wars that the<br/>\nonly thing that they knew about history was what wars happened.  They can<br/>\ntell you about the armament, the &quot;sides&quot; the issues, all the battles, but<br/>\nthe only reason they know that GWB is president is because he started a<br/>\nwar.  :)  I know people who love the history of fashion, or the use of<br/>\nhorses throughout history, or theatre, or historical film, or makeup, or<br/>\nmusic, or cooking, or kings and successions.   It may be a long stretch of<br/>\ntime or a short period of time.  It could be music throughtout history or it<br/>\ncould be limited to the creation and evolution of jazz.<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory isn&#39;t about facts and dates.  The reason we study history is to<br/>\nlearn about ideas!  History is taught SO wrong in schools.  LIst of dates,<br/>\nlists of names, lists of places and you have to put them all together.<br/>\nThat&#39;s not history.  History is not WWII.  WWII isn&#39;t about a bunch of<br/>\nbattles and the holocaust.  WWII is about how a dictatorship, allowing one<br/>\nsmall-minded person to have too much power, is not a good thing.  WWII is<br/>\nabout righting an injustice of several groups of people.  The important<br/>\nthing about WWII was not Hitler, Germany, the Japanese and Mousellini.  The<br/>\nimportant thing that people should know about WWII is that it is wrong to<br/>\npersecute people because of who they are.  If that is all that someone gets<br/>\nout of WWII then that in itself is enough history (IMNSHO).<br/>\nThe same could be said of just about any subject.  What about science?  Some<br/>\npeople really like science.  They watch the Science channel all day and have<br/>\na periodic table hanging on their walls.  Other people only know enough<br/>\nabout science to be able to know that if they let go of something that it is<br/>\ngoing to fall (gravity) unless it is filled with helium (or hydrogen) and<br/>\nthen it is going to rise.  They don&#39;t need to know that the reason that a<br/>\nhelium filled balloon rises is because helium is lighter than the<br/>\nsurrounding air nor that the surrounding air is made of a mixture of<br/>\nnitrogen and oxygen (and a bunch of other things.)  Some people will want to<br/>\nk now why other people are happy just knowing that if you drop something it<br/>\nwill fall and if you let go of a helium filled balloon it will rise.
