I don&#39;t really like sunscreen that much, seems odd to put a  bunch <br/>\nof chemicals on oneself to protect us from something natural, LOL, and I  <br/>\nprefer to go out later in the day so we don&#39;t need to use it.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou&#39;ve had some great suggestions and I hope something works.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I&#39;ve been in a no-win situation and it is a safety issue, I  gently draw <br/>\na line.  In my home it might go like this.  &quot;Pool time!  let&#39;s all get on our <br/>\nsunscreen!&quot;  &quot;I don&#39;t want sunscreen!!&quot;  &quot;It&#39;s  not safe to be in the pool <br/>\nwithout it.  We can play in the pool with  sunscreen or we can do <br/>\nXXXXXX(something good not in the sun)&quot;.  If  they continue to be upset, I validate it and <br/>\nrepeat the choices.  Then  maybe, &quot;it sounds like you don&#39;t want to put on <br/>\nsunscreen today, maybe we should  play princess instead, I&#39;ll get the tiaras!.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nWith my kids, giving them a good alternative often freed them up from  adding <br/>\nresistance on top of &quot;don&#39;t want to&quot;.  They were simply able to  choose.  And <br/>\nI had to be willing to cheerfully do either.<br/>\n <br/>\nI know it is not simple, especially with conflicting needs!<br/>\n <br/>\nCan you sit inside and play with her and be able to watch the others?   Or <br/>\ncreate some sort of shady tent where you two could have a tea party or  <br/>\nsomething?<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC, who is glad her children are finally past the sunscreen  issue  <br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12657,"nextTopicId":12993}}
