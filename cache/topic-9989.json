Set a timer for 15 minutes and head in there with a specific goal in mind. So the first time you&#39;ll go in and put away books and toys for 15 minutes. Stop when the timer goes off whether you&#39;re done or not. Next time pick up laundry and put away clothes for 15 minutes. Keep doing this as often as you feel the urge. Eventually the mess gets cleaned up. The trick is to limit yourself to the 15 minutes so that you know the job won&#39;t last forever.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water.

My <br/>\n&gt; husband was brought up with strict rules about chores, but he <br/>\n&gt; never did them, and resented <br/>\n&gt; he parents b/c of it.  I grew up a bit differently, 4 kids, 2 <br/>\n&gt; adults, we each took turns washing <br/>\n&gt; the dishes(i hated it), but on Sat. all the chores were thrown in <br/>\n&gt; a hat and everyone choose <br/>\n&gt; two.  You got whatever, and if someone was willing to trade, you <br/>\n&gt; did.  My mom and dad both <br/>\n&gt; worked full time, and we were willing to help, our house was never <br/>\n&gt; spotless(far from it) but <br/>\n&gt; we were happy in it.  The Sandra Dodd web site has a section on <br/>\n&gt; chores, reading all of it has <br/>\n&gt; helped me.  We had chores for our kids, and I didn&#39;t like the <br/>\n&gt; struggle, strife it caused.  So I do <br/>\n&gt; what I can, and do ask for help, my oldest  empties the dishwasher <br/>\n&gt; when things get hectic.  <br/>\n&gt; She always has the right to say no, and does.  The other two like <br/>\n&gt; laundry so they help when <br/>\n&gt; they want to also. My ? is it against unschooling, or just bad <br/>\n&gt; practice, to offer to pay her for <br/>\n&gt; jobs that I don&#39;t have time for?  Thanks for your ideas and <br/>\n&gt; advice.

Then toss clean clothing in one, dirty clothing in <br/>\nanother, boy 1&#39;s stuff in the third, boy 2&#39;s stuff in the 4th (and so <br/>\non for more boys). Everything goes in a basket...unless someone knows <br/>\nexactly where an item goes and goes ahead and puts it there instead of <br/>\nthe basket. By the time the baskets are full, you should have at least <br/>\na small amount of floor space visible (Lol). Take the dirty laundry <br/>\nbasket out to the laundry area. Then tackle the remaining baskets - <br/>\npick one and start putting stuff away. The good part of this is that <br/>\nif you get through only half the clean laundry basket and that&#39;s it, <br/>\nyou&#39;ve still got some little bit of organization going like a little <br/>\nyeast growing...next time you get a bit of time to clean, start with <br/>\nthe basket you left off with. And so on. In the meantime, between <br/>\ncleaning bursts, stuff can just get tossed into the baskets and be out <br/>\nof the way. And when a basket is empty, it folds up and stores <br/>\ncompactly until it is needed again (if indeed any of the baskets ever <br/>\nget emptied, ours tend to get emptier and fuller but not usually <br/>\ntotally empty). And the basket that carried the dirty laundry down is <br/>\nthe same one it can go back up to their room in. Again, if it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nget put away immediately, at least it&#39;s contained. For actual storage, <br/>\nwe have lots of clear plastic bins with lids (so they can stack) and <br/>\nwe label each with the intended contents: one is Vehicles for <br/>\ninstance - any toy that rolls, flies, etc goes in there. Another is <br/>\nfor People (all those action figures). And so on. Legos have their own <br/>\nmultiple bins in a separate location (down in the basement closet <br/>\nbecause that&#39;s where DH and DS build their Lego BrikWars scenarios). <br/>\nThomas trains and tracks have their own bin. And we have a couple <br/>\nlarger Rubbermaid type bins (big ones) for general jumble - those get <br/>\na going through once or twice a year to toss broken stuff, give away <br/>\noutgrown/outdated stuff, and sort back into circulation things like <br/>\ncars and people that just got tossed in there for a quick tidy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps trigger some ideas<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":253937257,"authorName":"April Morris","from":"&quot;April Morris&quot; &lt;klkb624@...&gt;","profile":"klkb624","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] chores","postDate":"1142516877","msgId":10820,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFlMjZhNTcxMDYwMzE2MDU0N3A1NWE5MTQ3Y2oxN2MwYzRmNDhiZjdlZTAzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGR2YnBqait1bHFrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGR2YnBqait1bHFrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10819,"nextInTopic":10823,"prevInTime":10819,"nextInTime":10821,"topicId":9989,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Interestingly enough, back when we had chores and a bona fide chore chart, our house was messier and I got less help then I do now.

The only down side<br/>\nis I get in trouble if I don&#39;t put stuff away or if I leave a mess! :)  We<br/>\ntry to respect each other&#39;s needs though. Since a clean kitchen is important<br/>\nto Lisa, we all try to clean up after ourselves.  And even though I never<br/>\nmade my kids clean their rooms, the girls&#39; each keep their rooms spotless.<br/>\nMy only problem at the moment, and maybe someone can give some suggestions,<br/>\nis the boys&#39; room. It&#39;s pretty messy and disorganized at the moment.<br/>\nOverwhelming to them. I don&#39;t have a problem with cleaning their room or<br/>\nhelping them...it&#39;s just that it&#39;s really overwhelming to me as well. I know<br/>\nI just need to go in and start....but it&#39;s going to be tough for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-19, Lisa-17, Karl-14, & Ben-10.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reachhomeschool.com\">http://www.reachhomeschool.com</a><br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art www.artkunst23.com<br/>\n&quot;All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.&quot;<br/>\n  Gandalf the Grey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 3/16/06, Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;is it against unschooling, or just bad practice, to<br/>\n&gt; offer to pay her for<br/>\n&gt; jobs that I don&#39;t have time for? &quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not at all!

My husband was brought up with strict rules about chores, but he","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1280704657\">It is so funny that this came up, it is something that in our family we have struggled with.  My <br/>\nhusband was brought up with strict rules about chores, but he never did them, and resented <br/>\nhe parents b/c of it.  I grew up a bit differently, 4 kids, 2 adults, we each took turns washing <br/>\nthe dishes(i hated it), but on Sat. all the chores were thrown in a hat and everyone choose <br/>\ntwo.  You got whatever, and if someone was willing to trade, you did.  My mom and dad both <br/>\nworked full time, and we were willing to help, our house was never spotless(far from it) but <br/>\nwe were happy in it.  The Sandra Dodd web site has a section on chores, reading all of it has <br/>\nhelped me.  We had chores for our kids, and I didn&#39;t like the struggle, strife it caused.  So I do <br/>\nwhat I can, and do ask for help, my oldest  empties the dishwasher when things get hectic.  <br/>\nShe always has the right to say no, and does.  The other two like laundry so they help when <br/>\nthey want to also. My ? is it against unschooling, or just bad practice, to offer to pay her for <br/>\njobs that I don&#39;t have time for?  Thanks for your ideas and advice.
