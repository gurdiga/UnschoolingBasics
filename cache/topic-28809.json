I recommend starting with <br/>\nthe above. You had a bad moment. That&#39;s all. The joyful family life <br/>\nis still there. You only have to step back into it, and doing *that* <br/>\nis as easy as doing something fun with your kids. It doesn&#39;t have to <br/>\nbe anything fancy: make a pig pile, build a fort, snuggle together <br/>\nfor a while. Simply start fresh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying you pretend the bad moment never happened. Maybe you <br/>\nneed to talk to your kids about it, and maybe you can learn something <br/>\nfrom it that will prevent or help you with the next time. But <br/>\nreconnecting with your kids takes one small step in the right <br/>\ndirection. And then another. And then another.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what I try for when I&#39;m &quot;in the moment.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n* Breathe. Except when someone is in peril, there is always time for <br/>\na deep breath -- and I&#39;m not talking about that big breath one takes <br/>\nbefore you letting fly with some yelling. ;-) I take a deep breath <br/>\nand feel where it goes, paying attention to its effect on the tense <br/>\nspots in my shoulders, stomach, and neck (in that order, evidently, <br/>\nsince that&#39;s where I felt it when I did it just now). As I exhale, I <br/>\nrelax those tense spots even more, and then...<br/>\n<br/>\n* Decide if I am capable of empathy yet, and if I&#39;m not, I buy some <br/>\ntime. (Remember, there is no immediate peril. You can have more <br/>\ntime.) I think or say something like, &quot;I need a minute here. I&#39;m <br/>\nfeeling really tense and helpless, and I&#39;m worried I&#39;m going to lose <br/>\nmy temper.&quot; I had a therapist describe this as building a box around <br/>\nthe emotions. I haven&#39;t shut them off, and the box isn&#39;t to be used <br/>\nfor shoving them into some dusty attic that they might later escape <br/>\nfrom. It&#39;s a place where I can look at them, get a little distance <br/>\nfrom them, and start to be more objective. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Still not there? I leave the room. I worry about my kids feeling <br/>\nabandoned with their big feelings, so I try to preface this <br/>\nwith &quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; but I don&#39;t always manage it. Just the <br/>\nother night, I was irritated with Chloe and sort of stomped up the <br/>\nstairs to my room. She can have been in no doubt as to my state of <br/>\nmind. ;-) But we&#39;ve been together a long time now, and she also <br/>\nwasn&#39;t surprised when I returned a few minutes later in a more <br/>\ncheerful mindset. Once I&#39;ve had my timeout and I&#39;m ready to <br/>\nempathize...<br/>\n<br/>\n* I think about what this situation looks like for my child. I get <br/>\ninto her shoes. I think &quot;All she wants is ___________&quot; and fill in <br/>\nthe blank. In my experience, whatever it is that goes in that blank <br/>\nwill not be unreasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\n* We move on to finding solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Joyce Fetteroll wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A lot of times, anger and frustration come from a feeling of not  <br/>\n&gt; being in control of your life.

I can definitely relate to what you are feeling.  I have found that when I am frustrated and/or angry it is usually because I have not given myself the time and attention I need.  This is very important to do.  I have also realized that when I was working outside of the home, I felt purposeful and connected in some way.  What I have had to remind myself is that the time that I am investing in my family at this time takes purpose and is a worthy aspiration.  Making time and taking it to do the things I enjoy doing most for myself is what I am going to do to stay connected with other adults.  Thanks again for sharing.  Congratulations on taking the steps to homeschool your children.  Remember that when you decide to step out of the familiar, you will most often meet resistance.  We are all in this fight together.

We have been quite disconnected lately as well, with lots of stress from inside and outside our family unit. We visited my sister and family which always takes me some emotional recovery time, then we were hit with the flu on the car trip home (nothing like puking kids in the car to push my buttons, don&#39;t know about you!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have felt my patience and compassion seeping away over the last 5 days of being isolated with my kids, being sick myself and not being able to get the rest I need, and this angry, resentful attitude taking its place and yesterday I started to yell at the girls. I was bawling about it in regret shortly thereafter when I looked into their little faces and saw how confused they were - just feeling yucky and wanting me to be the mature one and I was the one throwing a fit. I ended up in that place again today, and we all ended up on the bed today crying and reading books, with them saying &#39;don&#39;t cry mommy just read&#39;. Thank god my dh could swing home for an hour and let me sleep and have them cling to him for awhile, then I could get up and be a much more kind and compassionate mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to say thank you Pam as well for the practice you suggested - it comes at a much needed time for me as well! I know there isn&#39;t just one thing that makes it a black and white issue for me as learning to deal with anger is a work in progress for me. I now understand that feeling the rage does feel more powerful in the moment (and can be quite addicting) and it takes work and effort and mindfulness to be willing to feel the hurt, the sadness, the powerlessness that comes when I breathe and am conscious of my kids and my own experience and how hard it is sometimes to be a parent and not be able to put myself first. Thank god I&#39;m willing to learn.

We have been quite disconnected lately as well, with lots of stress from inside and outside our family unit.  We visited my sister and family which always takes me some emotional recovery time, then we were hit with the flu on the car trip home (nothing like puking kids in the car to push my buttons, don&#39;t know about you!).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have felt my patience and compassion seeping away over the last 5 days of being isolated with my kids, being sick myself and not being able to get the rest I need, and this angry, resentful attitude taking its place and yesterday I started to yell at the girls.  I was bawling about it in regret shortly thereafter when I looked into their little faces and saw how confused they were - just feeling yucky and wanting me to be the mature one and I was the one throwing a fit.  I ended up in that place again today, and we all ended up on the bed today crying and reading books, with them saying &#39;don&#39;t cry mommy just read&#39;.  Thank god my dh could swing home for an hour and let me sleep and have them cling to him for awhile, then I could get up and be a much more kind and compassionate mom.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I want to say thank you Pam as well for the practice you suggested - it comes at a much needed time for me as well!  I know there isn&#39;t just one thing that makes it a black and white issue for me as learning to deal with anger is a work in progress for me.  I now understand that feeling the rage does feel more powerful in the moment (and can be quite addicting) and it takes work and effort and mindfulness to be willing to feel the hurt, the sadness, the powerlessness that comes when I breathe and am conscious of my kids and my own experience and how hard it is sometimes to be a parent and not be able to put myself first.  Thank god I&#39;m willing to learn.  Thanks for being out there working on this stuff too.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Good night :o)<br/>\n  Jodi <br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nPamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 10, 2008, at 6:37 PM, Faith Void wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I thought of a question: How can I reestablish healthy boundaries and<br/>\n&gt; get back to a joyful family life with resorting to coercion?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may sound silly, but every time you feel your temper rising, make <br/>\nyourself get down and look into your child&#39;s eyes and make yourself <br/>\nsmile with love.
