From the new textbooks, the children of the American republic<br/>\nwill never gain knowledge of, or the slightest incentive to<br/>\nparticipate in, public affairs. Nor will they ever learn from their<br/>\nsociologized texts how to detect &quot;ambition under all its shapes.&quot; What<br/>\nthe new textbooks teach on every page and with every passive verb is<br/>\nthat, for all practical purposes, there is no such human activity as<br/>\npublic affairs and no such human motive as political ambition. How can<br/>\nthere be when &#39;faceless social forces&#39; make our history and the high<br/>\nand the mighty appear only as the victims of fate? No reader of these<br/>\ndegraded texts will ever learn from them how to &#39;judge for themselves<br/>\nwhat will secure or endanger their freedom.&#39; The new textbooks have<br/>\nsnuffed out the very idea of human freedom, for that freedom at bottom<br/>\nis precisely the human capacity for action that political history<br/>\nrecords and that the textbooks are at such pains to conceal. In the<br/>\n&#39;multiracial, multicultural&#39; America of the textbooks every citizen is<br/>\na tribesman and every tribesman the hapless subject of powers and<br/>\ndominions he does not even know exist. Such is &quot;good citizenship&quot; in<br/>\nthe corrupted common schools of contemporary America.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend you read the entire article by following the link<br/>\nabove.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19600,"nextTopicId":19469}}
