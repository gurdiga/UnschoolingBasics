I buy as big of multipacks as I can at the dollar store to keep them on hand.  My kids have &quot;Night light bath&quot; where we will put 2 to 4 glowsticks in the bathtub with them and have the lights out in the bathroom while they bathe.  They love that!!  Our dollar store had these &quot;glow lanterns&quot; which were like 10 or 12 of the bracelet size glow sticks, and then these two multi-connectors that you connected the ends to so when you were done it made a ball, kind of I guess like the Chinese paper lanterns in a way.  We bought them because you got so many glow sticks in a package, but the kids and I started playing with the connectors and making all sorts of neat stuff like flowers, twisty balls, bunny rabbits, etc.  My husband likes to do balloon animals, and one of his most popular requests at birthday parties is balloon swords, so we put an activated glowstick inside the balloon, he blew it up and twisted it into a sword, and we had glowing lightsaber swords!!  We&#39;ve also thrown them in the bottom of the pool when we swim at night, and on the last 4th of July I gave them to all the kids at the block party who didn&#39;t want sparklers.  We ended up with all the kids having them, which was great after it got dark because we could easily see where the kids were.  The kids also wear them when they go trick or treating so they can be seen easier (although the SP&#39;s here hand them out to all the kids on base that are trick or treating.  I&#39;m really going to miss military trick or treating!!).  They are great, and since the dollar store carries them year round now, they are cheap and easy to get.  <br/>\n<br/>\n°Ü°  Tina Rod.  °Ü°<br/>\n<br/>\nDysfunctional Domestic Diva<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8851,"nextTopicId":8922}}
