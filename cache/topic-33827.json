Hard to do as you all know. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOur kids ages are 13 mos, 3.5 yrs, 9 yrs, 11yrs.  We just started <br/>\nunschooling in March.

She works at the prison and is currently <br/>\non the swing shift (2-10pm).  She has to be at work at 145pm with <br/>\nTues/Weds off.  I work from 7am-1pm on the weekdays she works.  We <br/>\nliterally switch vehicles and kids in the parking lot of the VA.  I go <br/>\nhome (or wherever) and she hops on the shuttle and goes to work.  She <br/>\nhas the kids with her all day while I work 7-6pm Tues/Weds to make up <br/>\nmy 40 hours.  I have the kids on the weekends.  Together we have <br/>\nTues/weds evenings and Sat/Sun mornings as a family so we cherish that <br/>\ntime.  <br/>\n<br/>\nConfusing some days and not ideal at all but it&#39;s what we do now so <br/>\nthat we can have our kids at home with us doing what we all want to <br/>\ndo.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur goal is for one of us to move up so the other one can stay home <br/>\nfull time.  Most likely that will be me as this is my passion right now <br/>\nand I know my time with them as kids is finite.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I feel like I&#39;m rambling but to answer your question, yes, you <br/>\ncan do it if it&#39;s really what you want to do.  We are and though we are <br/>\ntired, we are happy with it.
