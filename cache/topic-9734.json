This is an issue that is very close to my heart.  I am not<br/>\nintending on breaking any group rules or offending anyone.  If choice in<br/>\nbirthing options is important to you, please participate and be heard...<br/>\n <br/>\n***   ALERT**** <br/>\nMidwifery Bill Introduced -  <br/>\nThe Political Climate in Oklahoma has recently changed.  We know that<br/>\nMidwives and Parents <br/>\nfreedoms have been challenged across the nation -  sadly, now it has come<br/>\nhome to Oklahoma! <br/>\nA Grassroots response must be in place by Feb. 6, 2006!!!!<br/>\nAn ineffective Midwifery bill written by Sen. Anderson&#39;s  office has already<br/>\nbeen filed. <br/>\nThe session opens on 2-6-06, the following  week the bill will be assigned<br/>\nto the committee. Each of us will have ONE WEEK to respond to the  local<br/>\npolitical leaders as to how we feel about this bill!  <br/>\nIt will take effort on our part to set this process in motion!  Our success<br/>\non establishing a Midwifery Friendly Bill will depend on the response of the<br/>\npeople!<br/>\nTODAY - Each one of you MUST contact as many families as possible to inform <br/>\nthem of the challenges we are facing.  They need to be ready to protect<br/>\ntheir rights by making<br/>\ncalls - writing letters -and any volunteer service they can offer.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThere is a Friends of Midwives group in place.  We MUST encourage others to<br/>\njoin the free on-line group.<br/>\nIt will be available to update them on the status of the bill as well as<br/>\ndirect them when to call<br/>\nthe political leaders in their area.  There is a FOMA handout to have<br/>\navailable for your clients/friends.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FriendsofOkMidwivesAlliance/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FriendsofOkMidwivesAlliance/</a>  contact to join!<br/>\nYou need to make yourself available to accept calls concerning this matter<br/>\nfor those who do not have a computer.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou can find the name, address, and other information on any legislator in<br/>\nthe country by going to www.vote-smart.org &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vote-smart.org/\">http://www.vote-smart.org/</a>&gt;  and<br/>\ntype in your 9 digit zip code.  <br/>\nAGAIN - Feb 6, 2006 the calls must begin.  <br/>\nThe lack of a clear and favorable legal status is a detriment to the future<br/>\nof Midwives and Parents to choose their birth place and care provider! We<br/>\nare a small group but we have the ability to be far reaching but it will<br/>\ntake more than 2 or 3 of us.  Please get involved!<br/>\nPLEASE CALL TODAY!  OUR FUTURE IS AT STAKE!!!!!!!!  <br/>\n <br/>\nIn Gratitude,<br/>\n<br/>\nChristy Putnam<br/>\nUnschooling Mom to Aden (1) and Seth (11)<br/>\nLoving wife of Chet (ann. 7/4/04)<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance\">http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance\">http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Go confidently in the direction of your<br/>\ndreams.
