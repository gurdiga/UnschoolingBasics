You wrote this email, didn&#39;t you? That means your English is<br/>\nfine--I had no problems understanding what you wrote and that&#39;s the<br/>\nessential of language--communication (and not three college-level<br/>\ncourses on Shakespeare).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for math, have you have had to use trigonometry and such outside of<br/>\nschool? Most of it doesn&#39;t apply to real life and so I wouldn&#39;t worry<br/>\nmuch. Your child will naturally want to learn (either now or later)<br/>\nthe essentials of math that are useful in life. As for you, once<br/>\nagain, don&#39;t worry. You can learn right along with him! What&#39;s the<br/>\nproblem if you both sit down with a mathbook (or whatever) together?<br/>\nThere&#39;s no reason why you can&#39;t both tackle a subject together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve helped performed surgery and done literally throusands of vitals<br/>\nand eye tests, yet never set foot in medical school. How? it all has<br/>\nto do with life&#39;s circumstances. A piece of paper does not define your<br/>\nexperience and abilities...experience and abilities within themselves<br/>\ndescribe what you know.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschooling.co.nr\">http://www.homeschooling.co.nr</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n= = = Original message = = =<br/>\n<br/>\nHi!
