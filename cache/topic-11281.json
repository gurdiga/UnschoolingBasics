We, too, have been with a charter program for about 5 years now<br/>\nand are preparing to leave and start the &quot;unschooling experience.&quot;  I am<br/>\nactually a little scared, but excited for the change.  Our educational<br/>\nconsultant at the charter commented on how much more work it is for the<br/>\nparents to unschool, and how difficult it can be with a little one (I have a<br/>\n10yo, 8yo, 5yo and 1yo).  I can imagine the liberating feeling of no more<br/>\npaperwork pressures and how we can learn by living life and reading classic<br/>\nbooks instead of learning what the state thinks everyone should know at a<br/>\ncertain age.  I think my kids are looking forward to it, and we are all<br/>\ntrying to think of a good name for our school.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI would be interested in how you are approaching &quot;deschooling&quot; and how long<br/>\nyou think it will last.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nMar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84525154,"authorName":"aroundthemilkyway","from":"&quot;aroundthemilkyway&quot; &lt;petalpollen@...&gt;","profile":"aroundthemilkyway","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"recent decisions","postDate":"1144102947","msgId":11281,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUwczc3MytjaXIzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11282,"prevInTime":11280,"nextInTime":11282,"topicId":11281,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"unschooling is so great! i looked back in the messages and our intro was #9978....this is just a brief update as to how !!!great!!! unschooling has been for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-880085926\">unschooling is so great!<br/>\n<br/>\ni looked back in the messages and our intro was #9978....this is just <br/>\na brief update as to how !!!great!!! unschooling has been for our <br/>\nfamily since that point!<br/>\n<br/>\nwell, we have made a decision to be done with the homeschool charter <br/>\nprogram we have been a part of the past couple years. both my husband <br/>\nand i feel it to be such a good decision....the philosophy there and <br/>\nin our home are just way too different. our dd&#39;s are excited for the <br/>\nchange.  the last number of weeks have just been so wonderful!!  <br/>\nsometimes i feel a bit too  lazy as i think i am missing out on some <br/>\nof the things my dd&#39;s would like to explore more about....but i think <br/>\ni am deschooling and therefore not providing all the avenues for <br/>\nthem....but in the same breath....if they are really interested they <br/>\nwill keep pursuing and asking me....as for right now....the play in <br/>\nour home has multiplied 10 fold and there is much more fun, laugher <br/>\nand joy!! unschooling causes me to breathe a giant sigh of relief <br/>\noften!  i, too, am going to make a list of all the wonderful things <br/>\nwe are able to do that would be missed if we weren&#39;t unschooling....i <br/>\nam so grateful for the relationships we are building as a family and <br/>\nfor the people my children are becoming.<br/>\nsarah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11295,"nextTopicId":11314}}
