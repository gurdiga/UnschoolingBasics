The children have to pass exams at the end of each school year, and if they fail, they have to repeat the year at a regular school, and you&#39;re not allowed to ever homeschool that child again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to homeschool, you have to notify the administration before the school year starts, and have to redo that each year, I guess. You don&#39;t have to use the textbooks, but I feel like they&#39;re good for orientation. And we got them for free (they forgot about collecting the money or don&#39;t know that homeschoolers have to pay as well).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my daughter doesn&#39;t have to do the workbooks, but she has to be able to write the letters (not read) and calculate (plus and minus) up to 20/30 (depends on the school that is testing) by the end of this school year. Othewise she&#39;ll have to attend a school.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, this year we&#39;re still free to &quot;fail&quot; because she&#39;s not yet &quot;obliged to be schooled/educated&quot;, compulsory schooling here starts at the age of six (you have to be six before September), so we &quot;missed&quot; it by 2 weeks (my dd was born on the Sept. 13th).

If *I* want to play with something/do something,<br/>\nI&#39;ll pull it out and invite DS (and DH) along for the ride. If DS is<br/>\nlooking for something, I *might* *suggest* an item he hasn&#39;t pulled out<br/>\nin a while but I am just as likely to suggest grabbing a deck of cards<br/>\nor the dominoes or a movie to do together at that time as well (even if<br/>\nwe&#39;ve been playing cards for days and days recently). Maybe stop and<br/>\nconsider if you would do/say the same things if it was your spouse or a<br/>\nfriend. Do you &#39;initiate&#39; knitting with your best friend because her<br/>\nknitting needles and yarn have been sitting on the shelf for 6 months?<br/>\nDoes your best friend &#39;initiate&#39; making candles because all the<br/>\ncandlemaking gear you bought last year has been sitting in the closet<br/>\nfor the last 10 months after you did a whole bunch of candlemaking over<br/>\nlast winter? Just because something was interesting, fascinating, fun 6<br/>\nmonths ago does not mean it is still interesting, fascinating, fun<br/>\ntoday. Just because something isn&#39;t of interest today doesn&#39;t mean it<br/>\nwon&#39;t re-appear 6 months from now. There are things in our house that<br/>\nare cyclic - for example, BrikWars usually only comes out during the<br/>\nwinter months when DH and DS are inside the house a lot and can spend<br/>\nlots of time building the scenarios and playing out the games. DS is<br/>\nrediscovering StarCraft on his laptop and playing many games with DH<br/>\neach day - something that he hadn&#39;t touched in months. On the other<br/>\nhand, he hasn&#39;t touched his Gameboy in quite a while and the videogames<br/>\nhe was playing over the summer are mostly sitting. But then again, last<br/>\nwinter I spent time knitting and learning a few pieces on the piano and<br/>\nI haven&#39;t touched either in months - but I *am* currently enthralled by<br/>\nmaking custom soaps (not totally from scratch - I buy the premade<br/>\nglycerin soap base, handling the lye and such to make soap from scratch<br/>\nis a little more hazardous than I care to get).<br/>\n <br/>\nYes, we do regularly dig through/up end some of the toy bins - quite<br/>\nhandily DS&#39; birthday is almost exactly 6 months away from Christmas, so<br/>\nthat makes for two very nice &quot;Hey let&#39;s clear out the old/broken toys to<br/>\nmake space&quot; times - and we often re-discover &quot;treasures&quot; in the process.<br/>\n(doh - just reminded myself I need to set aside some time soon for this<br/>\nlol). But there&#39;s no &quot;value&quot; judgment on any item or any thought of<br/>\n&quot;this is &#39;educational&#39; so I should &#39;get&#39; him to play with it&quot;.

The sheets were a bit dry to me but it was all I could find. So<br/>\nI was thinking - if I hadn&#39;t pulled these out, they would have never<br/>\nwent looking for the sheets themselves and I wondered how others<br/>\nhandled that, as I have read here of kids asking for workbooks or<br/>\nsheets. Then again, this might only happen in the beginning stages of<br/>\nunschooling, when everyone still has has the workbook mentality. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt also got me thinking about other activities. Example: We have had<br/>\nsome magnet kits here for months, sitting on a shelf in full view.<br/>\nWhen we first got them, they played with the kits for a couple weeks.<br/>\nBut nothing since then. I brought them out today and they loved<br/>\nexploring with them. But had I not initiated it, they would have kept<br/>\npassing it by.  Do you all have a general plan in the back of your<br/>\nhead that you are going to rotate books, activities, games, toys to<br/>\nthe forefront at certain times, both for fresh experiences and for<br/>\nencouraging a variety of interests, or do you leave it totally to the<br/>\nchildren to discover what&#39;s available? (example - the kinetix in the <br/>\ncloset that has not been touched for 6 months). <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again<br/>\n<br/>\nalison</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] another AhHa moment!     and question regarding worksheets","postDate":"1165460931","msgId":19558,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUxNTg5Ny43MjAxMS5xbUB3ZWI1MzgxMS5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGVsN3VvMStzcG1iQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19557,"nextInTopic":19559,"prevInTime":19557,"nextInTime":19559,"topicId":19557,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So the questions: 1) how many of your children actually do worksheets or workbooks because they want to (either by asking for some or just finding them in the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1602633188\">So the questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) how many of your children actually do worksheets or workbooks<br/>\nbecause they want to (either by asking for some or just finding them<br/>\nin the house)<br/>\n<br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  There was a time when Andy asked for math problems on paper, and I would print out a page of problems from a website I found that generates worksheets.  He loves and numbers, and does a lot of math in his head, so doing it on paper is usually a snap for him anyway.  It&#39;s been months since he asked for one, tho. Now that you mention it, he hasn&#39;t asked for one since we moved to our new house, and we don&#39;t have the catholic-schooled friend up the street bugging him about it. That boy and his Mom were a constant source of &#39;but you really need to go to school to learn anything&#39; comments.  One more thing we don&#39;t miss at our new house!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\n2) if so, Do you ever suggest that they do a page or two, just like<br/>\nyou might suggest they play a game if they ask for help in what to do?<br/>\nor is their interest completely their own<br/>\n<br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  I never suggest worksheets.  I only suggest a game if they seem at a loss for activities and I&#39;m willing to play the game with them.  Here&#39;s an idea -- how about a game of yatzeeh?  or Monopoly? or throw the ball in the yard? or watch a movie together?  There&#39;s a whole world of stuff for kids to do that don&#39;t involve worksheets or stilted attempts to make them learn something.  Besides, kids see right thru that -- they know you aren&#39;t suggesting it just for fun, but that you worry they aren&#39;t learning enough.  And if you&#39;re worried they can&#39;t learn without assignments or worksheets, how are they ever going to believe it about themselves?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Just go on vacation  -- call it Christmas break if that helps -- and don&#39;t go back to anything schooly. It&#39;s really easy once you get started.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I just have to trust that they are in fact learning more than I<br/>\nthought through natural means. <br/>\n<br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  It will be much easier for you to see what they&#39;re constantly learning more once you let go and trust that they&#39;ll learn.  It wil also be easier for them to trust themselves to learn what they need. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Mom to<br/>\n  Will (almost 22!)

But today I had a another Duh!!! moment, as<br/>\nin how could I not think they didn&#39;t already get this from basic life<br/>\nand reading!  I was &quot;teaching&quot; synonyms and antonyms with a worksheet.<br/>\nI also had a homonym page. We have discussed all these in the past,<br/>\nand they get the concept of all of them but they get stuck on the<br/>\nnames. Anyway, so we started doing the homonym page. It had a sentence<br/>\nwith a blank and at the end of the sentence, a pair of homonyms.<br/>\nBecause the kids have a very hard time spelling, I figured this was<br/>\ngoing to be very hard for them - to know which spelling they needed<br/>\nfor the sentence. They got everyone right! And my Duh! moment... Why<br/>\nin the world would I think that they might have problems with this?<br/>\nThey are very good readers and come across these words all the time.<br/>\nWhy did I think that I needed to *teach* this???  Answer: because the<br/>\ncurriculum says they should know what synonyms, antonyms, and homonyms<br/>\nmean and be able to use them correctly. Well, it was obvious that they<br/>\nhave the concepts and can apply their knowledge just fine.. Who cares<br/>\nif they don&#39;t remember the actual names for this concept at 6,7,8 or<br/>\neven 9 yrs old!!! So, that was my AhHa moment for the day. <br/>\n<br/>\nOK, now for the question - They had so much fun doing these worksheets<br/>\n that they wanted more, but we had to go to music class for my younger<br/>\nson. <br/>\nSo the questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) how many of your children actually do worksheets or workbooks<br/>\nbecause they want to (either by asking for some or just finding them<br/>\nin the house)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) if so, Do you ever suggest that they do a page or two, just like<br/>\nyou might suggest they play a game if they ask for help in what to do?<br/>\nor is their interest completely their own<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still trying to get a handle on all this... Though after today, I<br/>\nknow I just have to trust that they are in fact learning more than I<br/>\nthought through natural means. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlison</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19601,"nextTopicId":19600}}
