He asked me if it would kill him <br/>\nto eat them.  No....but it&#39;s probably not very nutritious.  For the <br/>\nmost part...other than a few conversations, he was just left on his <br/>\nown.

It is a completely natural response and medically a<br/>\ngood idea as well.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he pointed out that if anyone was really worried about what their<br/>\nneighbour was thinking, they could still enjoy picking their nose in<br/>\nprivate if they still wanted to get the benefits it offered.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95670547,"authorName":"Sherri-Lee Pressman","from":"Sherri-Lee Pressman &lt;sherri--lee@...&gt;","profile":"sherrileepr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] question - maybe OT - boogers","postDate":"1095992700","msgId":3308,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBJNEkwMDc4T1hEVE4yQGwtZGFlbW9uPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA4MTcwMWM0YTFkYSRkMDYzZjI1MCRjYWJiZTEwNEBnb3phPg=="},"prevInTopic":3307,"nextInTopic":3309,"prevInTime":3307,"nextInTime":3309,"topicId":3307,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, first I have to say I am not being snarky in anyway, but as an unschooler, wouldn t the answer to this be... don t limit him, let him eat it, it won t","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1304313197\">Hi, first I have to say I am not being snarky in anyway, but as an<br/>\nunschooler, wouldn&#39;t the answer to this be... don&#39;t limit him, let him eat<br/>\nit, it won&#39;t actually hurt him health wise.
