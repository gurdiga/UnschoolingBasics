How <br/>\ndoes your child learn math through play and everyday activities?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling is &quot;not schooling.&quot; This list is for stories of how <br/>\nunschooling works. We&#39;ll learn from each other by sharing experiences <br/>\nand observations. It is not a discussion list, not a debate list, and <br/>\nnot really even a &quot;support&quot; or &quot;advice&quot; list.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The lis owner will suggest topics, but any unschooling anecdote is <br/>\nalways welcome. All posts will go first to the list owner for approval. <br/>\nThe format of this list is somewhat reminiscent of a magazine, with the <br/>\nlist owner playing the role of editor. But, posts do not not need to be <br/>\n&quot;formal&quot; - brief anecdotes are as welcome as more lengthy stories.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Welcome ----<br/>\n<br/>\n  Pam Sorooshian<br/>\n  UnschoolingStories List Owner</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2942,"nextTopicId":2945}}
