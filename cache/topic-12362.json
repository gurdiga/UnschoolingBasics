Here is an example:<br/>\n  &gt; Him - Mom what&#39;s the weather today<br/>\n  &gt; Me - It&#39;s going to be 67 degrees<br/>\n  &gt; Him - Is that hot or cold?<br/>\n  &gt; Me - It&#39;s warm&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; Him - so do I need my jacket?<br/>\n  &gt; Me - no, but you can take it if you&#39;d like to in case you get cold<br/>\n  &gt; Him - is it cold outside today?<br/>\n  &gt; Me - no, it&#39;s not cold, it&#39;s warm<br/>\n  &gt; Him - so I can wear my jacket?<br/>\n  &gt; Me - yes<br/>\n  &gt; Him - because it might get cold<br/>\n  &gt; Me - yes<br/>\n  &gt; Him - is it hot or is it cold<br/>\n  &gt; Me - it warm<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This sounds like a conversation that I would have with Keon.  We have<br/>\n  weather discussions all the time.  I&#39;ve gotten to the point where I tell him<br/>\n  to go check for himself.  I figure if he feels what the weather is and<br/>\n  decides to wear his jacket and gets hot (which rarely he will notice due to<br/>\n  his limitations in being able to recognize such things so I would have to<br/>\n  tell him he is hot) that he can always take the jacket off.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Many of our conversations are like this.  Often he will keep going and I<br/>\n  &gt; just have to stop him.  It&#39;s very frustrating because neither one of us<br/>\n  &gt; understands the other.  It&#39;s as though his language comprehension is still<br/>\n  &gt; at the stage of a 3 or 4 year old.  He must be spoken to very simply and<br/>\n  &gt; plainly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yep.  Sounds very familiar.  It has gotten better this past year thanks to<br/>\n  age and development.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So...I&#39;m thinking...is what he&#39;s eating the issue?  My son likes to graze -<br/>\n  &gt; he rarely ever eats a full meal, which is fine.  All he likes to eat mostly<br/>\n  &gt; are carbs: cereal, waffles, bread, french fries, etc.  He won&#39;t eat much<br/>\n  &gt; meat or any other protein for that matter.  I think only eggs and peanut<br/>\n  &gt; butter - but that&#39;s about it.  Since I&#39;ve let go of food choices, I&#39;ve<br/>\n  &gt; noticed his behavior getting worse in terms of his frustration levels.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n  &gt; also noticed that he&#39;s eating LOTS of Froot Loops.  How do I talk to him<br/>\n  &gt; about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have major issues with artificial colors.  Fruit Loops have tons of them.<br/>\n  Would he be open to eating a natural colored sweetened cereal?  There are<br/>\n  several on the market that taste remarkably like the original brand names.<br/>\n  My oldest child has a sensitivity to Red Dye #40 (a known behavioural<br/>\n  allergen!!!) and while her life isn&#39;t in danger if she eats it (like a<br/>\n  person who can&#39;t eat peanuts or shellfish) it does impact her ability to<br/>\n  cope.  She&#39;s aware of it and now as a teenager chooses whether or not she<br/>\n  wants to consume products that have this coloring in it.  There are SO many<br/>\n  artificial colors, flavors and preservatives that are behavioural<br/>\n  allergens.  We discovered Emily&#39;s allergy when she was a toddler (thankfully<br/>\n  as she was a real handful) and we allowed her to see how this product<br/>\n  impacted her behaviour.  We have never been very strict about her<br/>\n  consumption of it, but we have had to remind her on occaission the effects<br/>\n  that this product has on her body and ability to cope with life in general.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve heard about the elimination diet.  But I don&#39;t think he&#39;d be very happy<br/>\n  &gt; with that at all.  We would ALL have to go on that diet - and that&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; probably not going to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  You can do single food eliminations.  Although it isn&#39;t as effective, it can<br/>\n  be done.  There is a wonderful book called &quot;Is this your child&quot; by Doris<br/>\n  Rapp (maybe Rupp, it&#39;s not right here at the computer).  It is all about<br/>\n  allergens, including behavioural allergens.  It is SO comforting to actually<br/>\n  have someone acknowledge that there is such a thing as a behavioural<br/>\n  allergen!!  I see the book at half.com all the time for around $8.  It&#39;s a<br/>\n  HUGE book and a HUGE read, but you can break it down by symptoms if you need<br/>\n  to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve mentioned this before.  Keon does not have the ability to recognize<br/>\n  things like being full, hungry, tired, frustrated, hot, cold, etc.  He also<br/>\n  will reach for carby food before proteins basically because carby food is so<br/>\n  much easier to get.  A bag of chips is easier to grab than a block of cheese<br/>\n  and a knife.  I&#39;ve gotten to where I will put aside leftover chicken in<br/>\n  cubes for him or purchase beef jerky or cube some cheese and leave for him<br/>\n  so he can easily access more proteins.  He will eat an egg just about<br/>\n  anyway, so I&#39;ll see him getting frustrated with his life due to lack of<br/>\n  proteins and offer to cook him an egg (or two or three.)  He&#39;ll eat them<br/>\n  boild, scrambled, fried, omellettes, poached, baked, doesn&#39;t matter. But it<br/>\n  is a quick easy protein to get into him very quickly.  We talk often (in<br/>\n  long drawn out conversations like the weather) about food choices and the<br/>\n  need for both protein and carbohydrates.  And sometimes I will tell him that<br/>\n  he seems like he just needs some more protein and he will ask me to come<br/>\n  help him find some.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --<br/>\n  Michelle<br/>\n  Independent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\n  The Pampered Chef<br/>\n  850-474-0817<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr&lt;http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr&lt;http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a>&gt;<br/>\n  Ask me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

WIth us, we&#39;ve always looked at food issues  <br/>\nbeing a part of the sensory load. We initially dealt with the sensory  <br/>\nstuff, and that seemed to help a lot with eating issues. So stuff  <br/>\nlike heavy lifting, lots of play in sensory bins , massage, lots of  <br/>\nbouncing, and a technique called &#39;brushing&#39; (if you google  <br/>\nwillabarger you can read more) It made a huge difference in their  <br/>\ncomprehension, eating variety, and also sleeping and playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve removed from josh&#39;s diet and didn&#39;t notice anything, but  <br/>\nremoving corn products from Breanna did help. If she gets the tiniest  <br/>\nbit of corn, she is lost. That includes corn starch, corn syrup, high  <br/>\nfructose corn syrup, corn meal, corn flour, and anything cooked in  <br/>\ncorn oils.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might look into also, Teach Me Language, which helps with  <br/>\nfunctional language. We don&#39;t use it the way most people do, which is  <br/>\nsitting at a table doing tasks over and over with a reward system,  <br/>\nbut we&#39;ve managed to integrate it a lot into our lives, and it helps  <br/>\nME know what the deficits are. Language is too instinctual for me to  <br/>\nunderstand why they are having trouble! One thing I noticed in the  <br/>\nsupplied conversation (which sounds like something in our house with  <br/>\nany one of our kids lol!) was that you were answering all the  <br/>\nquestions. One thing we started doing was asking questions back to  <br/>\nsort of give them more empowerment. So maybe when he asks if it&#39;s hot  <br/>\nor cold, you could ask him what he thinks. Or when he asks if it&#39;s  <br/>\ncold, you could ask him to do a weather check for the family and  <br/>\nreport back.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Apr 22, 2006, at 9:25 AM, Maisha Khalfani wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading with GREAT interest the posts about food  <br/>\n&gt; choices.  I&#39;m not sure how to handle this with my 6 yr old son.  He  <br/>\n&gt; still has MAJOR meltdowns and tantrums - he gets frustrated soooo  <br/>\n&gt; easily.  Lately he&#39;s been getting extremely angry, jumping up and  <br/>\n&gt; down and flailing is arms when he&#39;s frustrated.  And he doesn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; want me to hug him when he&#39;s like that.  We&#39;ve seen a geneticist,  <br/>\n&gt; made sure his skull has enough room for his brain to grow, etc.  I  <br/>\n&gt; saw a doctor once who said my son definitely has some developmental  <br/>\n&gt; issues, but nothing that could be pinpointed - great.  The  <br/>\n&gt; geneticist and another psychologist said the same thing.  He has  <br/>\n&gt; characteristics of aspergers, adhd, and ppd all at once.  He will  <br/>\n&gt; ask me the same question over and over in the span of 5-10  <br/>\n&gt; minutes.  Anything I say to him has to be broken down to the barest  <br/>\n&gt; of the english language.  Here is an example:<br/>\n&gt; Him - Mom what&#39;s the weather today<br/>\n&gt; Me - It&#39;s going to be 67 degrees<br/>\n&gt; Him - Is that hot or cold?<br/>\n&gt; Me - It&#39;s warm&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Him - so do I need my jacket?<br/>\n&gt; Me - no, but you can take it if you&#39;d like to in case you get cold<br/>\n&gt; Him - is it cold outside today?<br/>\n&gt; Me - no, it&#39;s not cold, it&#39;s warm<br/>\n&gt; Him - so I can wear my jacket?<br/>\n&gt; Me - yes<br/>\n&gt; Him - because it might get cold<br/>\n&gt; Me - yes<br/>\n&gt; Him - is it hot or is it cold<br/>\n&gt; Me - it warm<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Many of our conversations are like this.  Often he will keep going  <br/>\n&gt; and I just have to stop him.  It&#39;s very frustrating because neither  <br/>\n&gt; one of us understands the other.  It&#39;s as though his language  <br/>\n&gt; comprehension is still at the stage of a 3 or 4 year old.

My son likes to  <br/>\n&gt; graze - he rarely ever eats a full meal, which is fine.

She&#39;s aware of it and now as a teenager chooses whether or not she<br/>\nwants to consume products that have this coloring in it.

Although it isn&#39;t as effective, it can<br/>\nbe done.  There is a wonderful book called &quot;Is this your child&quot; by Doris<br/>\nRapp (maybe Rupp, it&#39;s not right here at the computer).  It is all about<br/>\nallergens, including behavioural allergens.  It is SO comforting to actually<br/>\nhave someone acknowledge that there is such a thing as a behavioural<br/>\nallergen!!  I see the book at half.com all the time for around $8.  It&#39;s a<br/>\nHUGE book and a HUGE read, but you can break it down by symptoms if you need<br/>\nto.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve mentioned this before.  Keon does not have the ability to recognize<br/>\nthings like being full, hungry, tired, frustrated, hot, cold, etc.  He also<br/>\nwill reach for carby food before proteins basically because carby food is so<br/>\nmuch easier to get.  A bag of chips is easier to grab than a block of cheese<br/>\nand a knife.  I&#39;ve gotten to where I will put aside leftover chicken in<br/>\ncubes for him or purchase beef jerky or cube some cheese and leave for him<br/>\nso he can easily access more proteins.  He will eat an egg just about<br/>\nanyway, so I&#39;ll see him getting frustrated with his life due to lack of<br/>\nproteins and offer to cook him an egg (or two or three.)  He&#39;ll eat them<br/>\nboild, scrambled, fried, omellettes, poached, baked, doesn&#39;t matter. But it<br/>\nis a quick easy protein to get into him very quickly.  We talk often (in<br/>\nlong drawn out conversations like the weather) about food choices and the<br/>\nneed for both protein and carbohydrates.  And sometimes I will tell him that<br/>\nhe seems like he just needs some more protein and he will ask me to come<br/>\nhelp him find some.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92643757,"authorName":"Leslie530@aol.com","from":"Leslie530@...","profile":"lescather","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] food choices","postDate":"1145718952","msgId":12366,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNiMS4xMjg5ODM1LjMxN2JhMmE4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":12364,"nextInTopic":12367,"prevInTime":12365,"nextInTime":12367,"topicId":12362,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/22/2006 10:32:08 A.M.

Often he will keep going and I<br/>\n&gt; just have to stop him.  It&#39;s very frustrating because neither one of us<br/>\n&gt; understands the other.
