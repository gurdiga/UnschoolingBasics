However I am very skeptical of getting help from the state, &quot;which is the only way I can afford it&quot; because they look into your personal life. I don&#39;t want anyone getting involved with our business, I know they won&#39;t agree with unschooling, and I don&#39;t want to go thru any more battles, which might be very departmental for my daughter at this point. I think I&#39;ll start looking on line to see what I can find out, haven&#39;t thought about the book store, duh!  As far as grieving goes, I know she has been grieving, but is afraid to let it all out, even though we are close, she doesn&#39;t want to hurt me in any way. So her release is eating, as is mine.. I know we need to start getting out and joining some groups. I&#39;ve been looking for just that, but  haven&#39;t been successful as of yet. The groups I have found are for adults only &quot;go figure&quot;.  But I&#39;m not giving up here. Thanks for your ideas,<br/>\n I will look into them...

I&#39;ve been reading all your posts on children eating <br/>\nsweets, and I just think, my story needs to be told. I am a overweight <br/>\nmom of a 11 year old overweight daughter, and to be honest with you, I <br/>\nreally don&#39;t know who is right or wrong about how a child grows up, one <br/>\nhaving no sweets in the house verses one having anything they wanted. I <br/>\nfeel that I eat out of stress, due to money issues, being single again, <br/>\nand my disabilities. I also believe my daughter eats for the same <br/>\nreasons. Living off the state for any disabilities doesn&#39;t bring enough <br/>\nmoney in for anything, let alone the bills. I&#39;ve really needed to be <br/>\nwatching my daughters and my eating habits, however the more stress, <br/>\nthe more you eat. Right before my disabilities we use to walk 3 miles a <br/>\nday without a problem, since then, and two years ago, we have had to <br/>\nlive another life. We are lucky if we can get to the YWCA a few times a <br/>\nweek to do water workouts. Since this all has happened in our life, I <br/>\nhave put on 50 pounds, my daughter has put on 50-60 pounds. She is now <br/>\nat danger of going on pills for Diabetes this week. She just can&#39;t seem <br/>\nto shake off the weight, myself included. I have tried everything I <br/>\ncould to keep healthy stuff around the house, it doesn&#39;t work, we end <br/>\nup going out and getting something sweet at the end of almost each day. <br/>\nI allow one or maybe two sweets a day, but it just seems as if we <br/>\naren&#39;t loosing the weight. I come from a family where my mother was a <br/>\njunk food junkie, but in secret, she hid all the stuff. As kids we <br/>\nweren&#39;t allowed to have much. When my daughter was born, she was a very <br/>\npicky eater, and wouldn&#39;t eat much at all. Infact I had to feed her 7 <br/>\nor 8 times a day just to make sure she got enough food intake. I think <br/>\nshe has learned the eating pattern from watching me, even though I <br/>\nnever really offered her a lot of sweets, it seems like I just can&#39;t <br/>\nstop her either. I would like to change things and let her eat all she <br/>\nwants, but at this point I&#39;m to scared. She has type 2 diabetes that <br/>\ncan be controlled with what she eats, and  Doctors say 2 hrs of <br/>\nexercise a day. &quot;A bit too unrealistic in my book&quot;. Any pointers, I <br/>\nwould love to hear them. I seem to be stuck... <br/>\n<br/>\n                      Debra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":58929735,"authorName":"Schafer Vanessa","from":"Schafer Vanessa &lt;psychomom95@...&gt;","profile":"psychomom95","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: An unschooling newbie","postDate":"1169429513","msgId":20874,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU3MTg5Ny40MDUxMC5xbUB3ZWI2MDgxNC5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGVwMGR1aytqMWU4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20869,"nextInTopic":20882,"prevInTime":20873,"nextInTime":20875,"topicId":20851,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"They are helping me, because they want to, not because I am trying to sneak math in. ...

You have to stop thinking about math in terms of<br/>\nworksheets, textbooks, pages of drill problems and memorizing the<br/>\ntimes table, etc. You&#39;re thinking of learning as this separate process<br/>\nthat occurs outside the realm of real life only when workbooks and<br/>\nschool assignments are present. That&#39;s really limiting. They will &quot;do&quot;<br/>\nmath as it applies to their life. If they have an allowance and they<br/>\nwant to buy something from the store then they&#39;ll have to figure out<br/>\nhow much they need to save and so forth. If they want to make a cake<br/>\nthey&#39;ll need to understand measurements like weight, volume, and<br/>\ntemperature. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll learn to tell time just by going about<br/>\ntheir lives (or perhaps they already know).<br/>\n<br/>\nCertain math skills are required in common living experiences, others<br/>\naren&#39;t. And if they aren&#39;t necessary for everyday living, then there<br/>\nisn&#39;t a reason to know them right now because that information would<br/>\nserve no purpose; it has no forseeable application. You&#39;re right -<br/>\nyour kids probably will avoid doing workbook stuff, and if that&#39;s the<br/>\nonly way you think of learning, then you&#39;re definitely selling things<br/>\nshort! It&#39;s certainly not the only way to learn math or any other<br/>\nskill.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond - and this may be the hardest thing you&#39;ll ever do - you need<br/>\nto stop thinking that you ever taught them anything. You didn&#39;t. You<br/>\nmight have helped them further their own understanding, but the truth<br/>\nis that the only way anyone ever learns is when we&#39;re ready,<br/>\ninterested, and have received the information in a meaningful way.<br/>\n*They* learned it, you helped them by providing information or<br/>\nexperiences. But you didn&#39;t open up their heads and insert the<br/>\ninformation.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you &quot;teach&quot; your kids to walk? To eat? No. You might have held<br/>\ntheir hands and surrounded them with opportunity, encouragement and<br/>\nexamples, but you didn&#39;t teach it. Just as surely you didn&#39;t teach<br/>\nthem their ABCs or how to read. It&#39;s funny how society looks at<br/>\nlearning as if it&#39;s something done to a child, like a process applied<br/>\nto a kid by the teacher. But it&#39;s not. It&#39;s internal and natural and<br/>\nautomatic when the right elements are in place. I read somewhere that<br/>\nit&#39;s helpful to replace the word &quot;teach&quot; with the word &quot;learn&quot;. You<br/>\ncould even put a dollar in a jar everything you think or say, &quot;I<br/>\nteach&quot; or &quot;they were taught&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if you could get past those two (admittedly big) hurdles then<br/>\nyou&#39;d be able to relax a bit and feel comfortable giving unschooling a<br/>\nreal go.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: An unschooling newbie","postDate":"1169351870","msgId":20859,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVvdW9idStyN3A4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVvdHA5bCtkbGgwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20857,"nextInTopic":20860,"prevInTime":20858,"nextInTime":20860,"topicId":20851,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~I can t seem to get my head out of that mindset.

I can think of half a dozen &quot;successful&quot; people I <br/>\nknow personally who fit that description (okay, One of them writes <br/>\nstories! but that&#39;s not his main job). <br/>\n<br/>\nTake some time on your own to think of all the things you did/do for <br/>\npleasure and what kinds of things you learned from them. Look at the <br/>\nadults around you who are happy - where and how did they learn &quot;what <br/>\nthey needed&quot; to be who and where they are today? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kinds of computer games do your kids enjoy? Do you play them <br/>\ntoo? That can be a big mental hurdle for a Lot of adults - kind of <br/>\nlike Rock and Roll was a big mental hurdle a couple generations <br/>\nago ;) Try out some different games - really try, too, don&#39;t just <br/>\nplay for fifteen minutes and throw down the controller in <br/>\nfrustration. There&#39;s a learning curve in figuring out the controls, <br/>\nespecially if you&#39;re brand new. Play enough to get a sense of what <br/>\nthe goals are in the game and which parts are exciting to your kids. <br/>\nAsk them for help and advice (let *them* teach *you* something, <br/>\nmaybe!). Decide if you find the same parts fun or frustrating - <br/>\nthere&#39;s some valuble information, right there, about interests and <br/>\nlearning styles. Talk with your kids about the games from the <br/>\nperspective of someone who plays them - its a *different* <br/>\nperspective, and one that will bring you closer to your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":58929735,"authorName":"Schafer Vanessa","from":"Schafer Vanessa &lt;psychomom95@...&gt;","profile":"psychomom95","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] An unschooling newbie","postDate":"1169321974","msgId":20852,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMDA2LjM5NzM3LnFtQHdlYjYwODE0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVvdHA5bCtkbGgwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20851,"nextInTopic":20855,"prevInTime":20851,"nextInTime":20853,"topicId":20851,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kimberly, I am new to this also.

My kids were in public school,<br/>\nuntil September of last year.  They do play alot of<br/>\nvideo games, and play on the computer alot too.  I am<br/>\nok with this, because they are learning new things as<br/>\nthey play.  My ds is 11 and my dd is 9.  They don&#39;t<br/>\nmind not doing school, because they&#39;ve had so much of<br/>\nit.  We are able to have the freedom&#39;s that we&#39;ve<br/>\nnever had before, and we love it.  We have baked,<br/>\ncooked, and traveled with my parents.  We do math when<br/>\nwe go to the grocery store, because I have them keep a<br/>\ntab on how much we&#39;ve spent by rounding dollar amounts<br/>\nup to the next even amount, and adding it all<br/>\ntogether.  They do pretty good.  We did some gardening<br/>\nthis last summer/fall, and decided we weren&#39;t planting<br/>\nany hostas because they were too hard to dig up.  Kids<br/>\nlearn all of the time, even if it doesn&#39;t look like<br/>\nthey are doing anything.  I love the unschooling life,<br/>\nwe learn every day by life&#39;s little lessons, and if<br/>\nthey ask questions, we find out the answers together.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you try it, and don&#39;t like it, you can always try a<br/>\ndifferent way.  My kids love it, because they had so<br/>\nmany things to do at school (my son had no less than 4<br/>\nor 5 book reports to do at public school, and hated<br/>\ndoing them, and my daughter had her own set of issues<br/>\ntoo.)  Unschooling affords them to learn about the<br/>\nthings they find interesting.  That&#39;s what is<br/>\nimportant--getting their love of learning back, by<br/>\nletting them pick and choose what they want to learn<br/>\nabout.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, let go, and have some fun.  Take time to<br/>\nenjoy your kids.  I am still trying to reconnect with<br/>\nmy kids, and learn what&#39;s important to them.  <br/>\n--- Kimberly &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:khaysgrow@...\">khaysgrow@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am new to unschooling.
