We are a family that has worked in agriculture and we have seen quite a bit on both ends of the spectrum, it is always a heart breaker when people don&#39;t care for the animals they have. We are advocates for buying local, naturally grown/raised when ever possible and abandoning commercial grocery stores, commercialized farming in general. An excellent set of videos on it are www.thetruecostoffood. org. and themeatrix.com. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are selective about the food we eat for similar reasons. I loved the fact that the Vegan family exposed him to different ideas and opened him up to a whole new world. They weren&#39;t necessarily pushing their life style as a choice for him but they did all come to an understanding. Tolerance on both sides of the fence and even the hunter learned patience to at least hear, not just listen to, other people&#39;s beliefs. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288405080,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"&quot;diana jenner&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Tolerance was Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Children on Radical Unschooler&#39;s Network","postDate":"1219538855","msgId":35533,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDgwODIzMTc0N3Y2Y2U4MzFibmIxYzcwNjUyZDEwNGViMjdAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":35537,"prevInTime":35532,"nextInTime":35534,"topicId":35533,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hands down, one of my favorite catalysts for discussion is the television show 30 Days by Morgan Spurlock (the genius behind Super Size Me -- he sparked","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-3565260\">Hands down, one of my favorite catalysts for discussion is the television<br/>\nshow &quot;30 Days&quot; by Morgan Spurlock (the genius behind Super Size Me -- he<br/>\nsparked conversations between millions of people that would not have<br/>\nhappened without him - one of my favorite human qualities)<br/>\nThere was an interesting episode (#4, Season 3) where an anti-&quot;gay adoption&quot;<br/>\nwho called herself christian, stayed with two dads who&#39;d rescued 4 boys from<br/>\nthe Detroit foster care system.

Maybe it&#39;s that some<br/>\n&gt; people are so turned off by the idea of same sex sex that they&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; subconsciously decided that the sex must be better.
