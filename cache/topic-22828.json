If","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1726451671\">Maybe check with DH on what the actual problem is during a calm, <br/>\nquiet time. My guess (and a very rough guess at that) is that DH is <br/>\nmissing the kid-time. If he&#39;s leaving for work just as DS (and the <br/>\nrest) are getting really awake, he probably isn&#39;t getting as much <br/>\ntime to spend with them as he might like, thus prompting him <br/>\nto &quot;let&quot;/want them to stay up later once he&#39;s home from work. <br/>\nWorking at cross purposes to his own stated desires somewhat. Then, <br/>\nget the family together and let them know that Dad really wants to <br/>\nspend more time together, this is his work schedule, how can we meet <br/>\nas many needs as possible. You/he might be surprised by the creative <br/>\nresults that come up. Would having everyone be up earlier 2 days per <br/>\nweek? 3? 4? help DH feel better about the situation. Are there other <br/>\nways for DH to connect before/after work? For instance, if the kids <br/>\nstay up late with him, he might need to realize that the next day <br/>\nthey&#39;ll sleep later - maybe that could be a time for you and DH to <br/>\nhave a little quiet togetherness over a cup of tea. Basically, <br/>\nbrainstorm and get at least 3 options before you even think about <br/>\ndeciding anything - there are way more options than early to <br/>\nbed/early to rise every day and sleeping in every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I am off to work at 7:30 Mon-Fri and get home around <br/>\n5:30. We all tend to stay up until around 11 pm most nights. DS <br/>\n(almost 9) is usually still fast asleep when I leave. So, I make <br/>\nsure to call home once or twice a day to just say hi, I might leave <br/>\na little note at &quot;his&quot; place at the kitchen table, I make sure to <br/>\nallot at least 15 minutes *immediately* when I get home to see how <br/>\nhis day has been (and let the mail sorting wait), and so on. Many <br/>\nmore ways to connect than simply requiring him to be up early and in <br/>\nbed early.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":110899439,"authorName":"Sharissa13","from":"Sharissa13 &lt;sharissa13@...&gt;","profile":"sharissa13","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"night owl (kinda OT)","postDate":"1175193089","msgId":22828,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg3MjE0Ni42MjkxOS5xbUB3ZWIzNjEwMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22830,"prevInTime":22827,"nextInTime":22829,"topicId":22828,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son is 8 years old and he is very much a night owl.

I send<br/>\nhim to his room at 10 pm (sometimes later) each night,<br/>\nbut tell him he doesn&#39;t have to sleep as long as he<br/>\ncan be quiet while he plays. I don&#39;t see a problem<br/>\nwith this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, on the other hand, is frustrated by it. He<br/>\ngets up around 8 every morning and want everyone to be<br/>\nshowered and ready to go with the day by 10, not just<br/>\ngetting up (he works afternoons and evenings at a<br/>\ntattoo shop). Every day he complains about how much<br/>\ntime we&#39;re wasting just lounging around. He thinks the<br/>\nkids need a bedtime of 8 or 9, but then he will let<br/>\nthem stay up till all hours whenever it suits him. It<br/>\ndrives me nuts! The kids get frustrated because dad<br/>\nsometimes lets them stay up pretty late, and mom is<br/>\nalways trying to get them to bed at 10. Dad gets<br/>\nfrustrated because the kids don&#39;t want to go to bed at<br/>\n10 anymore (they want to stay up later now). I&#39;m<br/>\ngetting frustrated because no matter how I try to talk<br/>\nto my husband, he doesn&#39;t seem to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry. I guess this is more a rant than a request for<br/>\nideas. But I would appreciate ideas on how to handle<br/>\nthis whole thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBe a PS3 game guru.<br/>\nGet your game face on with the latest PS3 news and previews at Yahoo!
