Our guidelines were <br/>\nthat only two children be on it at one time and they had to be similar <br/>\nsize so that one wasn&#39;t likely to bounce the other one off.  My kids <br/>\nspent HOURS on that thing and they played on it, not just bounced.  <br/>\nThey created all kind of games that didn&#39;t require much bouncing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest like someone else suggested that if it was possible <br/>\nyou might go with him.
