I was absolutely brutalized in school beginning with a kindergarten teacher who pulled my hair all the time and resented me because I could already read fluently as I had learned at home when I was 4. I had humiliating experiences all through school to include high school. I ended up getting a job at 16 so I could afford to attend our church&#39;s school for the remainder of high school.<br/>\n      Bravo for you for taking him out when you knew he was miserable. I wish my parents would have had the option or the motivation to do the same for me as a child. Just relax for a while and enjoy being with your son. Go places with him, let him try new video games, join a sport or boy scouts or whatever he&#39;s into. Watch with wonder as eventuallly he comes out of his shell and starts learning all the time and everywhere he goes. You totally did the best thing for him so hang in there! You have all the support you could ask for here. There&#39;s another unschooling yahoo group called Alwayslearning....it&#39;s a bit more active and you may find some awesome stuff there, too. Also check out Sandra Dodd&#39;s website. She&#39;s kinda the unschooling guru and has LOTS of good stuff for all of us. Take care and please don&#39;t hesitate to email me off list.

Maybe he needs a regular schedule. Maybe he needs a very tidy environment. Maybe he needs a watch and a calender and a day planner. Maybe he needs to go to anime conferences every six weeks ;) All of those are examples of different kinds of &quot;structure&quot; which might be helpful to a kid who need predictability and/or regularity. But you won&#39;t know any of that until you all have time to shake the dust of school out of your hair and relax a bit. <br/>\n<br/>\nDespite the &quot;one month deschooling for each year of school&quot; rule-of-thumb, kids who have a rough time in school can take a good bit longer. We pulled Ray out of school at 13, and in some ways it was over a year before he was done deschooling. He needed a looooot of healing. It was probably two years before he had gone from &quot;learning sucks&quot; to &quot;How can anyone learn Nothing for a whole day? It&#39;s not possible. Learning happens all the time.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI assume you&#39;ve been to Sandra&#39;s site, but I&#39;ll post a good page for beginning unschoolers anyway, since there&#39;s bound to be someone else who&#39;s new ;)<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/beginning\">http://sandradodd.com/beginning</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":250057382,"authorName":"Tova","from":"Tova &lt;ml_ja@...&gt;","profile":"ml_ja","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Hello!

I finally dropped out, much to my parents disapproval, about 16 because I couldn&#39;t take the abuse any longer. I wish I had known about unschooling and all the many resources and opportunities for young people who don&#39;t go to school.<br/>\nYour son is so lucky! Unschooling is an amazing path for both child and parent. We&#39;ve been predominantly unschooling for 11 years in our house. <br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend &#39;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&#39; by Grace Llewellyn. This is the best read on the subject in my opinion. It is a very useful and powerful book. It has chapters for each subject and recommendations on how to unschool them. <br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nTova<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Fri, 11/11/11, schooldzed &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gretchen@...\">gretchen@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: schooldzed &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gretchen@...\">gretchen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Hello!
