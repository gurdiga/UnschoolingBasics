That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have friends that do these things,<br/>\nnor do I tell them what I think most of the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis list exists to examine those very things. Yes, I believe you are<br/>\n&quot;clinging&quot; to a comfortable way of being if you can&#39;t release<br/>\npunishments and manipulation of your children. I also believe nobody<br/>\ncan assist anyone in releasing those things unless they want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list is here to help people do just that, IF they wish. If not,<br/>\npeople can utilize the parts they like and ignore the rest. Just like<br/>\neverything else in life...they can use THEIR judgement to choose.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the word &quot;respect&quot; is flung about too casually. I DON&#39;T<br/>\nrespect certain practices. I DO respect people&#39;s right to make their<br/>\nown choices though.

They need guidance and assistance. They need partners, not <br/>\ndictators.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe owners and moderators of this list---and many contributing members) <br/>\nare radical unschooling parents.

A lot---*most* of <br/>\nus---have questioned how we were reared and how we were educated and <br/>\nbelieve we have found a better and more respectful way of living with <br/>\nour children.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou certainly don&#39;t have to subscribe to radical unschooling to read <br/>\nhere!

Its pretty convoluted - either the kids eventually figure out <br/>\nthat the allowance has nothing to do with chores (so much for mom as <br/>\ntrustworthy) or at some point the allowance *becomes* linked to the <br/>\nchores in your mind, too, and you have a reward/punishment system <br/>\nset up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I dont say...WELL NOW U DONT GET A STICKER...KWIM?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have to say it. They notice. Sometimes the reward isn&#39;t <br/>\nworth the bother. That&#39;s what reward systems ultimately &quot;teach&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nKids don&#39;t need rewards to help out - I have a 14yr old stepson who <br/>\ntransitioned from a traditional school family to our radical <br/>\nunschooling home a year and a half ago. He has no chores. There are <br/>\nno &quot;rewards&quot; and any money etc he gets from us is totally unrelated <br/>\nto anything he does. But over time he has started helping out around <br/>\nthe house. Why shouldn&#39;t he? Its his home. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 6yo has &quot;always&quot; been unschooled. She has no chores and we don&#39;t <br/>\ndo any kinds of rewards at all. Sometimes she picks up, or washes <br/>\nsome dishes, or folds and puts away laundry, or feeds the pets. <br/>\nSometimes we ask her, other times she sees something needs to be <br/>\ndone and decides to do it. Its not the picture-perfect child putting <br/>\naway toys every night, for sure, but its totally voluntary on her <br/>\npart, and that&#39;s marvelous to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to address this from the earlier post:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;my 4 yr old would get into so much trouble ect ect.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Should I let my kids fight and beat eachother up just to &quot;learn&quot; that<br/>\nit hurts and it is NOT ACCECCPTABLE in life? <br/>\n***************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nMy stepson lived with rules and discipline. And yet, he was one of <br/>\nthose kids who was always in trouble. Eventually, the school was in <br/>\nthe process of expelling him and he pulled a knife on his mom&#39;s <br/>\nboyfriend and she sent him to live with us. Now he lives with no <br/>\nrules - just those principles that Joyce and others have mentioned. <br/>\nThey aren&#39;t &quot;applied&quot; to him in the ways rules are applied, its a <br/>\ndifferent way of thinking, really. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy partner and I value mutual support, for example, so we support <br/>\neach other and our kids as best we can - and over time Ray has <br/>\nstarted to be supportive of us and Mo, too. We value kindness and <br/>\nrespectfulness, so we are kind to the kids and each other, we <br/>\nrespect each others ideas and wants and wishes and try to honor <br/>\nthem - the kids&#39; too. And so a 14yo &quot;troublemaker&quot; is now kind and <br/>\ngracious and respectful of others&#39; ideas and wants and wishes. Why <br/>\nwould this be? Bc he lives in the middle of these values (or <br/>\nprinciples) and knows how it feels to be treated this way. It feels <br/>\ngood. It meets some of his own, human needs for connection and <br/>\nfeeling loved and valued. And that lets him turn around and offer <br/>\nthe same goodness to others. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how &quot;principles&quot; work. Its a different mindset from rules. <br/>\nIts not that I&#39;m kind as a way to &quot;get&quot; my kids to be kind - but I <br/>\nknow that when people are kind to me I&#39;m motivated to be kind to <br/>\nothers and I trust that other people, the people in my family in <br/>\nparticular, will respond the same way. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so tying that back in with the &quot;chores&quot; thing - in an <br/>\nenvironment of mutual supportiveness, people want to help one <br/>\nanother and look for ways to do that. Even kid-people! They don&#39;t <br/>\nalways have the energy to be helpful and supportive, though. Little <br/>\nkids, especially, use a whole lot of their daily energy just meeting <br/>\ntheir internal needs - there are just sooooooo many things they need <br/>\nhelp with. If they don&#39;t get enough help (and &quot;enough&quot; varies with <br/>\nthe kid, the day, hunger, tireness....) they aren&#39;t able to turn <br/>\naround and be helpful very well. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference between radical unschooling and more traditional <br/>\nparenting is that when kids aren&#39;t feeling up to being helpful, its <br/>\nan invitation to unschooling parents to practice some more of those <br/>\nlovely principles, like kindness and grace and compassion. In <br/>\ntraditional parenting, its time for a lesson. It might be a gentle, <br/>\nsubtle lesson, like no offer of a sticker, but its still not a kind, <br/>\ncompassionate response to a small person who just isn&#39;t up for <br/>\nputting his socks in the hamper today. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to say you&#39;re some kind of big meanie! It sounds like <br/>\nyou are trying to keep the &quot;lesson&quot; as kind as possible. What I&#39;m <br/>\nsaying is that you don&#39;t need lessons at all. Its a different way of <br/>\nlooking at the whole picture.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 14)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Radical Unschooling?","postDate":"1210365555","msgId":32632,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcwMmNwaisxcjhzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU1Mjg1Ny43MTk4OC5xbUB3ZWI2NTUwNi5tYWlsLmFjNC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":32627,"nextInTopic":32633,"prevInTime":32631,"nextInTime":32633,"topicId":32590,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... garbage out everyday!

My kids would be  <br/>\nwild so I have to control them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNope. Works the other way. Kids who are raised knowing their parents  <br/>\nare there to help them get what they want from life *continue* to be  <br/>\ntrustworthy kids. Kids who are controlled, who know their parents  <br/>\nwill say no, learn that to get what they want they have to get around  <br/>\ntheir parents somehow. Their parents aren&#39;t their partners. Their  <br/>\nparents are their adversaries in a game of getting the kids to do  <br/>\nwhat the parents want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Should I let my kids fight and beat eachother up just to &quot;learn&quot; that<br/>\n&gt; it hurts and it is NOT ACCECCPTABLE in life?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t thinks so because it&#39;s unlikely that&#39;s the lesson that would  <br/>\nbe learned. It&#39;s very likely that the older, bigger one would bully  <br/>\nthe younger, smaller one. The older would learn that to solve  <br/>\nproblems it rocks to have power. The younger would learn that it  <br/>\nsucks to lack power but often the best course is to give in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s also, often the lesson kids learn when parents hold the power.  <br/>\nThey learn that the best way to solve problems is to force someone to  <br/>\ndo it your way. It&#39;s the way parents have come up with after spending  <br/>\n30+ years on the planet so power must be the best solution to problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the opportunity to put real problem solving into practice and  <br/>\nhelp kids figure out better ways to get what they want than forcing  <br/>\nsomeone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;d like ideas on ways to help them figure out how to solve  <br/>\nrelationship issues you could ask here.

But often adults impose more boundaries on kids as practice  <br/>\nfor real life boundaries. Kids see right through that. If your  <br/>\nhusband said to you &quot;You can&#39;t go out past 8PM,&quot; would that have the  <br/>\nsame feel as the STOP sign at the end of the street? Kids know  <br/>\narbitrary parent imposed (or even family discussed) rules aren&#39;t the  <br/>\nsame as the real limitations of the rest of the world.

No one is labeling *people*. *Ideas*, though, are  <br/>\nlabeled as helpful or not helpful in building relationships and in  <br/>\ntreating children with the respect we would give another human being.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hardest part of extending unschooling philosophy into family life  <br/>\nis that parents can&#39;t conceive of what tools to use in place of  <br/>\ntraditional tools. So they immediately assume no tools at all. &quot;You  <br/>\ndon&#39;t tell them no??? You don&#39;t have rules??? ....&quot; Just because you  <br/>\ncan&#39;t see what other tools are possible, doesn&#39;t mean the tools don&#39;t  <br/>\nexist!<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the most helpful thing you can do for yourself to figure out  <br/>\nunschooling is to assume we want the exact same thing for our kids as  <br/>\nyou do.
