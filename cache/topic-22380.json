I have been through periods (weeks?)  where one child or the other is more aggressive toward the other for reasons not apparent to me. I have times when they get along together for weeks at a time with very little bickering. At still other times they are equally aggressive toward each other.  I have noticed this in my house in recent weeks. I attribute some of it to being &#39;cooped up&#39; indoors because of very cold weather. Sometimes the aggression is verbal  (e.g., You are stupid and I hate you!&#39; ) sometimes its pinching or shoving or hitting. Sometimes both.  These are  not behaviors they have learned from my husband and I. I sometimes point out to my children that  &quot;daddy and I sometimes disagree too. Its ok to disagree but we use other ways to work out the disagreement such as talking, <br/>\ngetting away from each other for a short time and then talking, etcetc&quot; (you get the idea). We do try to model working out disagreements without being physically or verbally abusive. I can understand that children are still working on developing communication skills and that they may strike out  impulsively in frustration . It does upset me though to see them hurting one another.  I try to let them work out their own disagreements as much as possible-  but at times when they become physical  one or the other will come to me asking for help working out the problem. When I hear them starting to disagree about something I keep an ear open to see if they will work it out without things getting too heated (which is nice) - then if tempers flare I am available to help them work it out.   <br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: Katharine Wise &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katharinewise@...\">katharinewise@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How much sibling aggression/pushing do others find is typical among boys?
