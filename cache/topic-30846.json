They are not &quot;how-to&quot; books for unschooling but they incorporate the ideas behind it. I really enjoyed reading them and I am now sure of what I felt from the beginning, that unschooling is best for Cadan and me (at least to begin with). I hope you find them as helpful as I have.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ~ Kristi<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?

How old are your kids?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We are quite new to this unschooly life too.  I just started reading books last fall, then dove in 100%.  There are many wise and experienced ones who I&#39;m sure will come by to give you the true meaning of unschooling.  People here will tell you the truth and give you lots of heartfelt support if you are sincere in your desire to learn about unschooling and to grow with your kids.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  To me, unschooling is primarily about trusting my children.  It is so much more to me than just keeping them out of school.  For me, it is really a lifestyle where we have chosen to eliminate rules (bedtime, tv, food, etc.), peacefully parent, choose connection with my kids over anything that would cause any sort of division between us, be willing to see past their behaviour, work with them instead of doing to them, choosing joy...and taking lots and lots of deep breaths!  This has turned all that I believed about myself, the world, relationships, parenting completely on its&#39; head.  I&#39;m not sure I know yet which end is up, but turns out I kind of dig this hanging out upside down bit too &lt;G&gt;. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Regarding books, if you peruse yesterday&#39;s posts you should find a book list.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi  <br/>\n<br/>\ngbccj58 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mommy2gnb@...\">mommy2gnb@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Hello my name is Christine.
