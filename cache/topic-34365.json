That&#39;s ridiculous not to do that! It&#39;s the<br/>\nlaw!&quot; And on and on. Not exactly conducive to a good relationship with<br/>\na kid. Good thing I have a filter on myself! My fears can make me<br/>\nobnoxious. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I would first look to see if it was the law for a 10 yr old<br/>\nto wear a helmet. Just because it&#39;s good to know the laws and what the<br/>\nconsequences are. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe look for a safe area for your son to do a timed ride? Like a<br/>\nrace by himself? A loop around a big park or a large, empty parking<br/>\nlot with obstacles. Talking to some friendly personnel at a bike store<br/>\nmight give him a chance to relate to &quot;peers&quot; with a common interest.<br/>\nEspecially if their older and experienced. And they might have some<br/>\nideas on natural loops around town or something. Information coming<br/>\nfrom peers without mom&#39;s input can sound different and fresh. At least<br/>\nfor my son it does.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like, maybe, your son is needing some reassurance with the<br/>\nbaby arriving soon? Some extra snuggles? This is just a guess on my part.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an almost 9yr old who is very snuggly still and loves having<br/>\ndown time with me and talking time with me. And yet he really needs<br/>\nhis space too, a chance to stretch his boundaries and challenge<br/>\nhimself, so it&#39;s a matter of setting that up for him to do safely. Do<br/>\nyou know what I mean? <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son doesn&#39;t want my help at all (with his interactions) when he&#39;s<br/>\non xbox live, but he&#39;ll come to bed and ask me to &quot;interview&quot; him<br/>\nabout what he played that day. And it&#39;s then, in the course of<br/>\nconversation, that he&#39;ll bring up situations that he needs help with<br/>\n(mean players, friends who don&#39;t play fair, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to go right now--just got home from work, but maybe some of<br/>\nthis makes sense. It might be a little jumbled I think. :)<br/>\n~~Juillet<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;swissarmy_wife&quot;<br/>\n&lt;heatherbean@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My oldest, almost 10 bought a bike pump yesterday.
