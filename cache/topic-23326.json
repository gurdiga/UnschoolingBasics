That has  <br/>\nstayed with me for more than 20 years since I read that book.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome examples include, when a relationship of mine failed, my partner  <br/>\nrealized it was an opportunity to do something he couldn&#39;t have done  <br/>\nif he stayed with me: move to San Francisco for awhile (we&#39;re still  <br/>\nbest friends 16 years later, so it wasn&#39;t a total failure).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I just spent a Sunday with an old friend from high school and  <br/>\ncollege. She and her husband both finished college in 4 years and got  <br/>\nPh. D.s in another four. He&#39;s a nuclear physicist, which pays quite  <br/>\nwell, but there aren&#39;t a whole lot of things you can do with a degree  <br/>\nin nuclear physics. He has never had a job he enjoyed or that didn&#39;t  <br/>\ntake him away from his family more than they wanted, in the sixteen  <br/>\nyears since they got their degrees. My friend said, &quot;We basically  <br/>\nlive for vacations now, and we&#39;ve decided to make early retirement a  <br/>\ngoal, so we&#39;re saving a lot.&quot; In her own words, it&#39;s sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, she even sometimes questions whether the success of their  <br/>\nrelationship has limited them. They met our first night in the dorm,  <br/>\nwere each other&#39;s first boyfriend and girlfriend at age 17, and have  <br/>\nbeen together ever since. They&#39;re very happily married but neither of  <br/>\nthem has ever been single and independent, or so much as kissed  <br/>\nanother person.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for me: I thought about doing a EurailPass around Europe after I  <br/>\ngraduated from college. But I got a big fellowship to grad school and  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t do it. Grad school sucked. I&#39;d probably have been really  <br/>\ndisappointed not to get into grad school, but in the long run I&#39;d  <br/>\nprobably have happier memories of a summer in Europe than I do of my  <br/>\nfirst attempt at grad school!<br/>\n<br/>\nSu</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Hello I am new here","postDate":"1177565664","msgId":23424,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOTU1REJBRUVEQzE2Mi1BRUMtMTJDNzdAV0VCTUFJTC1SRTEwPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYwYXQ4Yis0anFvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGYwYXQ4Yis0anFvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23381,"nextInTopic":23436,"prevInTime":23423,"nextInTime":23425,"topicId":23326,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

(I emphasized he &quot;had&quot; anxiety because as soon as I <br/>\npulled him out of school his anxiety diminished, then disappeared <br/>\naltogether.)  My DS had such a difficult time socially, it broke my <br/>\nheart.  He just did not fit in socially, but he is very, very <br/>\nbright, more mature in many ways than his peers.  Socially, he gets <br/>\nalong better with kids that are either older or younger than he is, <br/>\nand to be holed up in a classroom with kids his own age all day <br/>\nevery day who just did not &quot;get&quot; him was a nightmare for him. We <br/>\npulled him out of school in the 5th grade (1.5 years ago), tried <br/>\nhomeschooling for a while, but that didn&#39;t work, and we are now <br/>\npretty much radical unschoolers and I have never seen him happier.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s still in the DEschooling process, healing the wounds inflicted <br/>\nwhile in school, but he is SO much better off.

So take it or leave it, but my advice, which <br/>\ncomes straight from my heart, is to please remove your son from <br/>\nschool before even more damage is done.
