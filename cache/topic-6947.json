You sound like wonderful people.  <br/>\nSixteen years ago I lost my parents in a terrible accident.  I <br/>\nunderstand their pain.  Their fears as you mentioned are <br/>\nunderstandable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one of you could stay home and unschool them, that would be <br/>\nwonderful.  They need to be loved, have a feeling of security and just <br/>\nbe together.  Sending them to boarding school would be tragic and very <br/>\ndestructive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have legal custody of them, do what you feel is best in your own  <br/>\nhearts.  The rest of the family doesn&#39;t have the right to interfere.  <br/>\nYou both know what they need - lots of love and TLC at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nKay</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6930,"nextTopicId":6955}}
