He&#39;s<br/>\n8 1/2 and when he goes to MIL&#39;s (one evening per month for about 2 hrs),<br/>\nhis 3 yr old cousin is there (he lives there). DS was really really<br/>\nreally frustrated the last time because T always wants whatever DS has,<br/>\nright up to trying to snatch things out of his hands. If DS doesn&#39;t<br/>\nrelinquish it ASAP, T yells -at- DS. Not just crying because he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhave something but out and out yelling -at- someone. DS really restrains<br/>\nhis self and doesn&#39;t yell back or hit or anything (a mighty effort<br/>\nsometimes - he sometimes comes out and runs laps around the car before<br/>\nclimbing in to release the stress). I tried to explain to DS that that<br/>\nis the only way T knows to communicate when he needs/wants something<br/>\nbecause that&#39;s all he hears and usually the only thing that works - FIL,<br/>\nMIL, and both of DH&#39;s siblings living at home (T&#39;s mom is one of them)<br/>\npretty much just yell most of the time when they&#39;re not nitpicking and<br/>\nsniping and as a 3 yr old in a houseful of adults, T gets yelled at<br/>\npretty often (and even more just prior to that event because of some<br/>\nstresses going on there). It&#39;s not something DS is used to. By and<br/>\nlarge, yelling at our house is venting ARGHHHH! then calming down and<br/>\ntalking things out, not yelling AT someone (not perfectly but that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat we&#39;re aiming toward).<br/>\n <br/>\n(PS this event was the only time that MIL has said they had trouble<br/>\nwhile we were gone. Usually she says they were fine up until we arrived<br/>\nto pick up DS. Also, the arrangements are changing - MIL & FIL are<br/>\nmoving so DS&#39; visits with Grandma and Grandpa will be sans T as of next<br/>\nweek.

I think it helps so much when someone outside is looking in.<br/>\nTalking with my friend about her situation, I wasn&#39;t really sure what the basis of the problem is/was. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading your reply, I had an &quot;AHA!&quot; moment of my own.  I thought to myself, it&#39;s a test.  It&#39;s all a test. - A test of love.  (I&#39;m not trying to be mushy here, I&#39;m serious)  I think we all have lessons to learn and the basis of every lesson is love.  My two boys are expressions of love who are here to teach me love, and vis versa.  Boy, do I get tested!  The test is whether I will love them unconditionally or not.  - No matter what they do, will I love them through it no matter who they are?  Which brings to the point, trust.  Trust = loving unconditionally.  I don&#39;t think you can have one without the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of my friend and her son, he is &#39;testing&#39; her to see if he will be loved unconditionally - which is actually her universal lesson.  As long as it&#39;s proven that he is not being loved unconditionally, the testing (i.e. the problems between them [ds and the family]) are just going to continue and possibly get worse.  - And it could all be changed with something as simple as their perspective of their relationship with him.  If they were to accept him as they accept their other children, that would make the difference in the whole world.  - I feel that her ds wouldn&#39;t be testing her as much as he is now if she was to change her perspective.  In essence, he is not the problem, the problem is that he&#39;s not feeling accepted or loved unconditionally.  His behavior is a cry for what he really needs and they just see the behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I making any sense?  Or is this just rambling in my own head?

I didn&#39;t say unschooling was crap,<br/>\n&gt; it just isn&#39;t working here, because someone has no ambition to learn a<br/>\n&gt; damn thing....except about the school of hard knocks.  He hasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; missed a guitar lesson yet, but doesn&#39;t practice like he did before<br/>\n&gt; starting lessons.  He will consistently make the wrong choice when<br/>\n&gt; given the options of life or drugs, interesting alternatives or<br/>\n&gt; alcohol.  I expressed my distaste for the smell of alcohol on his<br/>\n&gt; breath yesterday on the way to guitar lessons and he looked me in the<br/>\n&gt; face and said that he hadn&#39;t been drinking, so my remark was that I<br/>\n&gt; was sorry that he fell into a fresh barrel and stunk so badly and that<br/>\n&gt; maybe he could avoid those kinds of accidents in the future by just<br/>\n&gt; staying away from the stuff altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmmm.  I probably would have responded with, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to accuse you.<br/>\n Your breath smelled strongly alcoholic.  Perhaps we should see a<br/>\ndoctor and have you tested for diabetes as an alcohol smell to the<br/>\nbreath is one sign of diabetes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nToday he has borrowed my book<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; on horticulture and is filling out an application for the natural food<br/>\n&gt; store.  We shall see how long this lasts, usually less than 2 days.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds like he is living up to your expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; His sister and I had a long discussion last night because she was<br/>\n&gt; crying and upset that her brother is throwing away his life and sadly,<br/>\n&gt; it affects us all, emotionally and financially.  I told her that we<br/>\n&gt; could give him a glass of water, but we can&#39;t make him drink it.  I<br/>\n&gt; also told her how proud I am of the good choices she has made and that<br/>\n&gt; I think she will go far in life and to not let the influence of her<br/>\n&gt; brother drag her down.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Throwing his life away?  I think he is working through some issues<br/>\nwith the given skills that he has and with the trust that he feels he<br/>\nhas from his family.  Perhaps he feels compared to his sister who<br/>\nseems nearly perfect in his parents eyes in comparison with how he<br/>\nfeels about himself.  NOt that that is the truth, but how he may feel.<br/>\n I grew up believing that my brother was the more perfect child<br/>\nbecause he was strong, athletic, good looking, didn&#39;t need braces or<br/>\nglasses and did &quot;just ok&quot; in school.  My brother grew up believing<br/>\nthat I was the more perfect child because I was cute, spunky, witty,<br/>\nwordly, and made good grades in school and completed many challenging<br/>\nthings through Girl Scouts.  In truth my parents were proud of both of<br/>\nus for different reasons.  This may be exagerated in your situation<br/>\nbecause there is one child who seems perfectly perfect and another<br/>\nchild who is seen as &quot;throwing his life away.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":213809267,"authorName":"jlh44music","from":"&quot;jlh44music&quot; &lt;jlh44music@...&gt;","profile":"jlh44music","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Need advice - teen","postDate":"1165341113","msgId":19529,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVsNGJqcCs2N29nQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVsNDlrbStxNDlwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19528,"nextInTopic":19530,"prevInTime":19528,"nextInTime":19530,"topicId":19518,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... help her to truly understand unschooling?
