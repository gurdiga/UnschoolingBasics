Anyone, anywhere, of any age, who is pushing their personal limits/doing something new and challenging in something is bound to come to points where they get frustrated and yell, stomp, whatever. It&#39;s all related to how important something is to the person - I don&#39;t get terribly frustrated by videogames because I&#39;m not a big gamer (I can handle a few minutes then I start getting dizzy from the motion; but, I did beat one of the Pokemon games way back on the Gameboy). On the other hand, last week I was making pies for DS&#39; birthday and the crusts were just not cooperating and boy, was I frustrated and grumbly and saying things like &quot;Come On! Why won&#39;t you WORK?!!&quot; The important thing is not to eliminate being frustrated but in how it is dealt with. Is anyone being injured? Is the controller being destroyed on a weekly basis? (and I know whereof I speak - DH was infamous in his family growing up for destroying controllers out of frustration) Or, is he venting verbally as a way to re-focus and master the challenge? My DS (13 and always unschooled) will stomp his foot and/or growl aloud (Arrrrrrr!) when he&#39;s stuck in a game. Sometimes he&#39;ll pause and walk away for a minute, sometimes he&#39;ll stop entirely for a time and do something else, and sometimes he fights through the frustration and masters the challenge. It&#39;s all good - those are coping skills that will be useful throughout his life because frustrations happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

He enjoys playing and gets quite caught up in the games. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe and an unschooled buddy are going to a gaming tournament of some kind this weekend. They&#39;ve been playing for years and like it. OTOH, they are both wonderful young men, a pleasure to be around and 18. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is to say they are not 13. Being 13 is tough. Being 13 is not being a young kid and not being grown enough so anyone treats you like you have a clue. Which you mostly don&#39;t but still. . . Being 13 is growth spurts and acne and girls not noticing you and all kinds of crappy middle school pressure. Being 13 can really suck.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome privacy and the time to do something you enjoy can make it less sucky. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot going to school will free your 13-year-old from the clock, as well. Getting up early to go to school (early meaning before noon) can be replaced with his body&#39;s natural sleep demands, leave time to play in a relaxed way (it may not look relaxed but it is not having to be squeezed into the school schedule) and otherwise free your son to explore his interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote, these may not be something that Dad enjoys. Or that you enjoy. They are his interests, not yours. They may or may not be something you can do together. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the beginning of your son growing up and possibly away from you. It is difficult and you miss them when this happens. It doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t love you or need you. It means they are finding their way. You can help by keeping a roof over their head, feeding them, driving them, paying as you can, encouraging, trying to understand what the heck they are talking about and being positive about it if they want to share, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not helpful to restrict and negate interests. It is not helpful to insist that all interests be available to public scrutiny and family participation and approval. <br/>\n<br/>\nPrivacy is an important thing. For all of us. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd time. Time to do what looks like nothing. Time not to have to worry about whether something will lead to a job or college. Time to grown and develop into a young adult. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, you asked. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ncg30&quot; &lt;ncg30@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you both for your responses!

Be kind to him. <br/>\nDon&#39;t keep lecturing him. He may understand in the moment when you are speaking <br/>\nto him or he may just be saying &quot;yes mom&quot; to get you to leave him be. Whichever, <br/>\nin the moment, in the heat of the game, he&#39;s excited and focused and speaking <br/>\nall those things out. Make sure that all else in his world, in that moment, is <br/>\ngood. Make sure that he isn&#39;t hungry by giving him something to eat, fix him a <br/>\nplatter of food, bring him a piece of cake, a sandwich, a piece of quiche, a <br/>\nburrito. Food is a huge factor, school is a big expense of energy, coming home <br/>\nfrom school he&#39;s probably tired and hungry and a bit on edge. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBe patient. Be more patient than he is. Recognise that you are the adult, that <br/>\nyou are the one who has had a longer time to learn to be patient, and be <br/>\npatient. If he&#39;s frustrated over something that you can help with, a level on a <br/>\ngame for example, look up information on the game. If he&#39;s frustrated with the <br/>\nway someone is playing, or the fact that he keeps dying, understand how <br/>\nfrustrating those things can be. Working in a team, or against a team, can have <br/>\nlots of frustrations. People often don&#39;t do what you think they ought to be <br/>\ndoing. In a big on-line brawl you have to hope that your teammates have your <br/>\nback so that your enemies don&#39;t get the chance to snipe you when you aren&#39;t <br/>\nlooking. Dying over and over again is so very frustrating. I&#39;ve been playing <br/>\nDrawn to Life on my ds and had to quit because I just got too frustrated with <br/>\nit. Fortunately I have other games to turn to, and I don&#39;t feel so intensely <br/>\nfocused on the game that I can&#39;t walk away. But when I was playing Okami and <br/>\nkept dying, man, I wanted to just get through the level. I got pretty grouchy. <br/>\nHad to apologise more than once. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you and he could come up with fun things to shout. I like &quot;buggerit, <br/>\nmillenium hand and shrimp&quot; from Terry Pratchett. The taunts from Monty Python <br/>\nare good. &quot;Your mother was a hamster and your father smells of elderberries.&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;I fart in your general direction.&quot; But oh my god and come on aren&#39;t <br/>\nparticularly harsh. Maybe you should breathe and not worry about his momentary <br/>\nfrustration quite so much. Sometimes it is easy to take on the tension of <br/>\nanother person, but it isn&#39;t your tension. I would let it go. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":108731863,"authorName":"ncg30","from":"&quot;ncg30&quot; &lt;ncg30@...&gt;","profile":"ncg30","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 4323","postDate":"1307537448","msgId":46816,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlzbnI3OCs1ODJnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGlta2RhZm55cUdjSGFUUHpmV3p6M2RpNmM0TGpnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46812,"nextInTopic":46825,"prevInTime":46815,"nextInTime":46817,"topicId":46812,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you both for your responses!

I have one son who<br/>\n&gt; is almost 13, going into 7th grade next year. I live in New Jersey. My son<br/>\n&gt; is very into his video games and computer (mostly watching You Tube videos<br/>\n&gt; from other gamers, their game reviews, watching them play the games he<br/>\n&gt; likes). This is all he does when he is home after his homework. My husband<br/>\n&gt; wants it to be cut back drastically. I know another mom whose son is older<br/>\n&gt; (19) and was always into his games and computers and has now basically shut<br/>\n&gt; himself off from his parents and will lock himself in his room and just play<br/>\n&gt; and not talk to them hardly at all. He will be extremely nasty and rude to<br/>\n&gt; his mother. This scares me. So I don&#39;t know what to do, if anything, since<br/>\n&gt; my son is still younger. He&#39;s already starting with some of the rudeness and<br/>\n&gt; anger either towards his games or towards me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am considering unschooling but would love to hear from others who pulled<br/>\n&gt; their children out of school at a later age like this. Also from others<br/>\n&gt; whose children are very into gaming and/or computers. I know in the book it<br/>\n&gt; talks about how parents would feel if they let their kids do what they want<br/>\n&gt; that all day (for example) they would play video games all day and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; having a hard time not thinking that way myself about my son. But I do know<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve never been thrilled with the public school system and my son doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really like school, never has. Mostly because overall he is on the quiet<br/>\n&gt; side and hasn&#39;t really made any friends, he talks to some kids at school but<br/>\n&gt; never had a close friend or buddy he hangs out with outside of school He&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; been picked on somewhat. We&#39;ve moved twice since he started school and are<br/>\n&gt; moving again this summer. So I&#39;m trying to decide if I should send him to<br/>\n&gt; the school in our new town or not. Any feedback from others would be greatly<br/>\n&gt; appreciated. It&#39;s wonderful to read the book but to hear from others and<br/>\n&gt; their real life current experiences, especially if they are similar to mine,<br/>\n&gt; would be most helpful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you and I&#39;m glad to be a part of the group!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Noelle :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Back to top &lt;#1306e701518bc088_toc&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Reply to sender<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ncg30@...\">ncg30@...</a>?Subject=Re%3A%20New%20to%20group%2E%2E%2E&gt; | Reply to<br/>\n&gt; group<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>?Subject=+Re%3A%20New%20to%20group%2E%2E%2E&gt;| Reply<br/>\n&gt; via web post  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/post;_ylc=X3oDMTJzdmozNmlyBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE1BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTcwNTA4MTk3MgRtc2dJZAM0NjgwNARzZWMDZG1zZwRzbGsDcnBseQRzdGltZQMxMzA3NTIyODkz?act=reply&messageNum=46804\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/post;_ylc=X3oDMTJzdmozNmlyBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE1BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTcwNTA4MTk3MgRtc2dJZAM0NjgwNARzZWMDZG1zZwRzbGsDcnBseQRzdGltZQMxMzA3NTIyODkz?act=reply&messageNum=46804</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46833,"nextTopicId":46806}}
