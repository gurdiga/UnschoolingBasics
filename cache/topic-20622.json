I always err on<br/>\nthe cautious side with injuries. I grew up with arthritis. I had alot<br/>\nof pain as a child. Not realizing it was related to arthritis (I had<br/>\ninternal inflammation only), dr.s initially just dx-ed sprains. I<br/>\nthink I had over 20 sprains on my chart for 5 yrs before they began<br/>\nfiguring it out. But after the first few, my parents and drs. didn&#39;t<br/>\nreally believe me. They thought I was just trying to get a little<br/>\nextra attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nI vowed I would never question my children&#39;s pain or illness. I know<br/>\nsometimes kids embellish for extra attention, but the risk of missing<br/>\nsomething is not worth the questioning. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust keep offering encouragement. I know my son expressed fears that<br/>\nhe might hurt it again - it was a real fear he had that was<br/>\ninterrupting his desire to walk. So we talked about taking it easy at<br/>\nfirst - just walking in the house. Then walking on the pavement,<br/>\nfinally walking on the grass (the worst for sore ankles - I know).

No one saw <br/>\n  it. My oldest was in the room with her and he didn&#39;t see it either. <br/>\n  She said she slipped. I don&#39;t know how she fell (as in positioning).<br/>\n<br/>\n  She said her right ankle hurt. We rested it, tried ice (that didn&#39;t <br/>\n  happen though), gave her Tylenol, Arnica, etc. It didn&#39;t swell or <br/>\n  bruise but she said she couldn&#39;t walk on it. I called the dr&#39;s <br/>\n  office, they said to wait and see, if she still couldn&#39;t walk on it, <br/>\n  give them a call on Monday. We ended up with an appt on Monday @ <br/>\n  2:30. By this point, she wouldn&#39;t walk on it, said it hurt and would <br/>\n  cry out if she stood on it. But she also would sit cross legged, <br/>\n  crawl, and lean on it while sitting and be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n  At the dr&#39;s, she had an exam, came out fine. Had bloodwork taken <br/>\n  because she still wouldn&#39;t walk on it (wanted to clear any unseen <br/>\n  issues). The bloodwork came back fine and we were sent for xrays. <br/>\n  The xrays came out fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, it&#39;s Tuesday 5pm and she&#39;s still not walking on it. <br/>\n  Periodically she&#39;ll stand on it and say &quot;oh Mommy!
