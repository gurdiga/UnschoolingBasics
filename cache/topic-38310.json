They do<br/>\nchores if they choose to do chores, they do them for as long as they<br/>\nwish, and they do the chores to their own standards. <br/>\n<br/>\nI consider any chores they do to be very considerate toward me, as the<br/>\nhousehold chores are primarily things that are my responsibility.

They are busy exploring and discovering and making <br/>\nconnections. That takes up a lot of time and energy, especially with <br/>\nyounger kids, like yours. Asking them to stop in the middle of all <br/>\nthat to do something they aren&#39;t interested in doing isn&#39;t a simple <br/>\nrequest from their perspectives. Its just as invasive as telling a <br/>\nchild to put away the blocks and come do a math worksheet.<br/>\n<br/>\n As kids get older, they&#39;ll start to have more appreciation for <br/>\norder. Learning how to create order will become one of their <br/>\ninterests and motivations - it really will! Yesterday my 15yo was <br/>\nutterly possessed with the urge to clean and organize his room. He&#39;s <br/>\nnot a tidy person by nature (and neither are his parents), either. <br/>\nBut he&#39;s reached a point in his life where cleaning his own space has <br/>\npersonal value. It happens. Kids are far less likely to do this sort <br/>\nof thing willingly if they haven&#39;t had the option to say &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not <br/>\nright now&quot; for awhile. Ray took almost two years of deschooling to <br/>\nget there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;...having our children perform...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I pulled this phrase out to highlight it a bit more. On its own, like <br/>\nthat, its a pretty scary concept. I suspect you don&#39;t really want <br/>\nyour relationship with your kids to be some kind of &quot;performance&quot; <br/>\nthat they put on for your benefit - most likely, you want to have a <br/>\ngenuinely caring relationship with them. But pushing children to do <br/>\nchores is a lot like requiring them to perform in some way (in my <br/>\nmind I have an image of a child standing on a chair reciting poetry <br/>\nfor guests) - it tears down the value of what they choose to do with <br/>\ntheir own time and energy. Unschooling revolves around supporting <br/>\nthose very choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We live in a modestly sized home, so it&#39;s important for sanity&#39;s <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sake <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that we attempt to stay fairly well organized & pick up messes <br/>\n </span></blockquote>before <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they become disasters.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As much as possible, streamline cleanup. Put down blankets for toys <br/>\nand games with small parts, so you can pick up the whole kitten-<br/>\nkaboodle in one swoop. Place bins and baskets in convenient locations <br/>\nfor cleanup. It might help to rethink some of the ways your whole <br/>\nhouse is organized with the needs of busy young children in mind, in <br/>\norder to make putting things *back* faster and more convenient. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our house, for instance, all the books in the house are in the <br/>\nprocess of being moved to the living room. My books and Morgan&#39;s <br/>\nbooks have been in our respective rooms, but she likes to read in the <br/>\nliving room more often, now, and Ray wants to read all my books - so <br/>\nits easier to do a big rearrangement than to keep running up and down <br/>\nthe stairs with armloads of books. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example - an unschooling mom I know irl has converted one <br/>\nbedroom in her house into The Lego and Trains Room. It ended up being <br/>\neasier on everyone to reshuffle sleeping arrangements and give over a <br/>\nwhole room to things with lots of tiny parts, so that all those parts <br/>\ncan stay in one place. They moved a tv in there so the kids don&#39;t <br/>\never have to argue about dragging legos into the living room to watch <br/>\ntv. The mom likes a tidy house, and this was a solution that worked <br/>\nwell for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, if I&#39;m in the midst of cleaning or tidying up <br/>\nfor company I&#39;ll tell the kids (my 7yo, especially) &quot;please don&#39;t <br/>\nbring that in here/ start that project/ get those toys out Right Now -<br/>\n I&#39;m trying to get the room clean!&quot; Plus I regularly say things <br/>\nlike &quot;please do that Over the trash can&quot; or &quot;do that in the sink&quot; or <br/>\neven &quot;that&#39;s too messy for inside, take it on the porch, please.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIts not a matter of mom giving up all her boundaries or something! <br/>\nMuch of where unschooling is different from other kinds of parenting, <br/>\nthough, has to do with questioning those boundaries to see when they <br/>\naren&#39;t really boundaries at all. Sometimes what we think are <br/>\nboundaries are habits or social conventions that can be modified or <br/>\ndone away with entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231930081,"authorName":"DJ250","from":"&quot;DJ250&quot; &lt;dj250@...&gt;","profile":"wibberbie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] What about cleaning her room?

And other Qs from a newbie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hello! I&#39;m Melissa, momma to three & newly interested in unschooling. <br/>\n  My eldest child, Madison, is 7 & we spent a year homeschooling <br/>\n  followed by a year in public school. We removed her from school at <br/>\n  the beginning of the her second year of public school & began <br/>\n  homeschooling again. <br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;ve always taken a really laid back approach to parenting & <br/>\n  schooling. We&#39;re mainly a family who really enjoys spending time <br/>\n  together, which is why we decided on the homeschooling route in the <br/>\n  first place. My husband works retail, so his schedule is always <br/>\n  changing & he rarely has weekends off; when Madison was in public <br/>\n  school, she would go days without seeing her dad. Not cool!<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I&#39;ve just recently joined this list & have been quietly reading <br/>\n  for a few days. There are some awesome people here & I totally <br/>\n  appreciate the words of wisdom passed along. I&#39;ve even written down <br/>\n  some quotations that have struck me; rereading them & putting them <br/>\n  into practice I think has already helped me be a gentler momma. I&#39;m <br/>\n  so thankful for that, as I&#39;ve struggled with keeping my cool. I&#39;m <br/>\n  ashamed to admit I&#39;ve been a yeller, so reading through the posts <br/>\n  here and following some really interesting links has reenforced & <br/>\n  firmed up my ability to practice patience with my little ones. Thank <br/>\n  you all for that!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve really enjoyed & learned from the discussion on <br/>\n  bedtimes/routines. Like I mentioned, my husband works retail so he <br/>\n  has some really late nights sometimes, so we don&#39;t make an early <br/>\n  bedtime a big deal. I&#39;ve gotten a lot of flack from my dad about not <br/>\n  having my children on a schedule. I say, we do have a schedule; it&#39;s <br/>\n  just a floating schedule that changes as we need it to. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I do have some questions for whomever has stayed with me through <br/>\n  all the blabbering. First, what about chores? I don&#39;t assign a list <br/>\n  of chores, but I do expect my girls to help out as time & age permit. <br/>\n  They&#39;re usually happy to help out, but there is occasional grumbling. <br/>\n  How do unschooling families deal with chores/houseworky type stuff? <br/>\n<br/>\n  We live in a modestly sized home, so it&#39;s important for sanity&#39;s sake <br/>\n  that we attempt to stay fairly well organized & pick up messes before <br/>\n  they become disasters. That said, I&#39;m not striving for anything other <br/>\n  than liveable & comfortable while my girls are young, so please don&#39;t <br/>\n  think I&#39;m asking how to keep a clean & pretty home. I simply wonder <br/>\n  what unschooling as a lifestyle says about having our children <br/>\n  perform some simple, basic chores. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I did have some other questions, but I&#39;ve managed to forget the <br/>\n  others in the time it&#39;s taken me to type this out, in between nursing <br/>\n  & answering questions & hearing some awesome facts about dinosaurs <br/>\n  (did you know that micropachycephalosaurus is the longest dinosaur <br/>\n  name?). <br/>\n<br/>\n  I look forward to acquiring some more unschooling wisdom!<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~Melissa<br/>\n  Madison (7), Meara (3) & Maisie Jane (4mos)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  No virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\n  Checked by AVG - www.avg.com <br/>\n  Version: 8.0.237 / Virus Database: 270.10.23/1951 - Release Date: 02/13/09 06:51:00<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":321488386,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"&quot;Melissa&quot; &lt;melchick210@...&gt;","profile":"melisssaaaa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"What about cleaning her room?

I&#39;m <br/>\nashamed to admit I&#39;ve been a yeller, so reading through the posts <br/>\nhere and following some really interesting links has reenforced & <br/>\nfirmed up my ability to practice patience with my little ones. Thank <br/>\nyou all for that!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve really enjoyed & learned from the discussion on <br/>\nbedtimes/routines. Like I mentioned, my husband works retail so he <br/>\nhas some really late nights sometimes, so we don&#39;t make an early <br/>\nbedtime a big deal. I&#39;ve gotten a lot of flack from my dad about not <br/>\nhaving my children on a schedule. I say, we do have a schedule; it&#39;s <br/>\njust a floating schedule that changes as we need it to. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I do have some questions for whomever has stayed with me through <br/>\nall the blabbering. First, what about chores? I don&#39;t assign a list <br/>\nof chores, but I do expect my girls to help out as time & age permit. <br/>\nThey&#39;re usually happy to help out, but there is occasional grumbling. <br/>\nHow do unschooling families deal with chores/houseworky type stuff? <br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in a modestly sized home, so it&#39;s important for sanity&#39;s sake <br/>\nthat we attempt to stay fairly well organized & pick up messes before <br/>\nthey become disasters. That said, I&#39;m not striving for anything other <br/>\nthan liveable & comfortable while my girls are young, so please don&#39;t <br/>\nthink I&#39;m asking how to keep a clean & pretty home. I simply wonder <br/>\nwhat unschooling as a lifestyle says about having our children <br/>\nperform some simple, basic chores.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI did have some other questions, but I&#39;ve managed to forget the <br/>\nothers in the time it&#39;s taken me to type this out, in between nursing <br/>\n& answering questions & hearing some awesome facts about dinosaurs <br/>\n(did you know that micropachycephalosaurus is the longest dinosaur <br/>\nname?). <br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to acquiring some more unschooling wisdom!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Melissa<br/>\n  Madison (7), Meara (3) & Maisie Jane (4mos)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38324,"nextTopicId":38302}}
