The <br/>\n&gt; schooling was very rigid. We were both struggling. I want her to <br/>\n&gt;enjoy <br/>\n&gt; learning and not be pushed through.

One thing to note is that the cut off is <br/>\nthe 15th percentile overall (that is she does better than 14 of 100 <br/>\nkids who take the test- and you have a choice of about half a dozen <br/>\nnationally normed tests, it&#39;s not the same test as the Oregon public <br/>\nschools since that is not nationally normed). So, if one score is <br/>\nlow and others are average or high, it can still be above the 15th <br/>\npercentile overall and all is well. Next, if she does manage (it&#39;s <br/>\npretty tough) to end up under 15th percentile overall, then you have <br/>\na year to work on it and re-test. If the score is the same or <br/>\nhigher, all is well and you go back to the regular testing schedule. <br/>\nIf it drops (say goes from 14 to 12), then you may end up having a <br/>\nteacher overseeing you (but then again you may not or you might get <br/>\na certified teacher who is pro-unschooling, there is no set <br/>\nrequirement as far as what happens between the overseer and you - <br/>\nyou might simply chat on the phone a couple times or call when you <br/>\nhave questions or whatever). If the score stays down for a 2nd year, <br/>\nthen and only then could there be further steps taken. Odds are that <br/>\nis pretty unlikely to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":167425760,"authorName":"home_wkids","from":"&quot;home_wkids&quot; &lt;LCB@...&gt;","profile":"home_wkids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"New and interested","postDate":"1127405673","msgId":6745,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRndWw5OStvbTFvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6746,"prevInTime":6744,"nextInTime":6746,"topicId":6745,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello everyone.
