This is modeling for our children - it&#39;s okay to get angry/upset/etc, but our feelings are ours to own and it&#39;s never okay to take it out on someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a family meeting. Explain your concerns and how the atmosphere is making you feel.

As a stop gap solution it may not be terrible, but it isn&#39;t going to much other than produce irritation at the moment of transition. If someone isn&#39;t done when their time slot is over, they are much more likely to get grouchy about giving it up, and the incoming person is going to be irritated at any delay. It may also make the focus on the computer greater than it already is. By controlling access in those ways every minute on the computer becomes more precious. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf time slots are the best option at this point, make sure that there is a buffer and that you are there to help negotiate the hand off. Make sure that it isn&#39;t an abrupt change of person using the computer, that there is a warning pre-handoff to try and get to a save point or a natural break point in the game, and that the point at which one person leaves can be enlarged to allow them to finish whatever it is that needs finishing. And work with a great sense of urgency to up the number of computers in your house. If you are local to a university, give them a call and see what they do with their old computers, or a school, or your local government offices. Look for hand-me-alongs. <br/>\nAlso, if they agree to one thing in a calm moment, don&#39;t throw that in their faces in a tense moment. What looks good in theory to a 4 year old or a 5 year old or a 7 year old or even a 10 year old may be difficult for them to stick to in practice. Be generous and kind with their inability to imagine what something will play out like in real life. And re-examine what works and what doesn&#39;t and change things as needed. <br/>\n<br/>\n++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;If my son freaks out, as he sometimes does, I will offer him support and recognition of why he&#39;s so upset, but I won&#39;t physically remove the item from the other child.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;This is a real problem area with my 7 yo.

It isn&#39;t fixable. It isn&#39;t something that you can explain in words so that he&#39;ll understand. Say I&#39;m sorry and mean it. Don&#39;t walk away from him. Turn to him. Be with him. Let him be upset <br/>\nbecause he can&#39;t do what he really wants to do. It&#39;s totally legitimate <br/>\nto be upset because you can&#39;t do what you want to do. Recognise that. Maybe talk about how fabulous it would be if he had his own ipad. Talk about what games he would play if he could just play it when he wanted. Maybe you could talk about what games he would build to play if he had his own ipad. Just talking may help him to come to terms with his frustration. It may not. But spend the time with him.

There are lots of things I do now that I didn&#39;t do when they were younger. I read books. I pretty much gave that up when they were small and needed me so much more. I play ukulele, although even that can come into conflict with Linnaea&#39;s needs on occassion. I&#39;m much better at setting stuff aside with years of practice though, so it isn&#39;t a real conflict, more a comedy conflict. I can clean the house, if I want to, which I don&#39;t tend to, but it is a possibility. Dinners can be more elaborate. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving 6 children 13, 10, 7, 5, 4, and 2 means that being more efficient with your time away from them, external to their direct care, will give you more time to help them out. Having buckets and bins about to toss toys into quickly. Having meals and snacks that are easy to put together and take almost no prep time. Paper plates might be worth having, so that you don&#39;t have to do dishes. Lots of clothes per child so that if you don&#39;t get around to laundry as often it isn&#39;t such a big deal. Really thinking through what you require from yourself to maintain your household. Lower your expectations to free your time for them. As they get older they will need you less. And on the days when they are with their dad you can catch up, maybe, or sleep ;-). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] How to stop being the fixer?

You could talk to Derek about not letting him have a drink of water. You could go get him a drink of water. You could go with him to get a drink of water, talking all the while about anything, maybe about water and how nice it is to drink when you are thirsty. You could talk about how Derek isn&#39;t letting him get a drink of water. See how many sinks he&#39;s blocking off, how many access points there are to water in the house. The kitchen sink, the bathroom sink, the shower, the bath, the toilet, water in the saucer under a plant pot, the hose outside, the dog&#39;s bowl, the rain barrel. So it becomes kind of problem solving, kind of questioning Derek&#39;s dominance over all things thirst-quenching, and mostly verbal play. So it moves that child from being upset to giggling and suggesting other access points. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2. &quot;I need to harvest my crops (on a game) and Brad won&#39;t give me the ipad!&quot;<br/>\nThe ipad isn&#39;t his, right. So that one means that it isn&#39;t his to use. From me, that would probably be an I&#39;m sorry, maybe he&#39;ll let you use it later. And then I&#39;d talk about what he&#39;d planted and why it needed harvesting. What game it was. And if he couldn&#39;t listen, then I&#39;d be still. And hold him if he&#39;d let me. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. &quot;Give me the blanket!&quot; (whap, whap, as the 5 yr old hits the 4 yr old)  Screaming starts.<br/>\nThat&#39;s clearly a step in moment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Crying randomly erupts...the 4 yr old has done something to the 2 yo again.<br/>\nGoodness, is the 4 year old passing down the violence the 5 year old did to him. That&#39;s kind of fascinating. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;This is just from the last five minutes, I swear.  They are so used to me taking care of it, or just screaming at each other...&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You said you have 6 children. Looking through the e-mails I tally ages of 13, 10, 7, 5, 4, 2. That&#39;s young children who need lots of care. I understand not fixing their problems, but I don&#39;t think Joyce was suggesting that you not take care of them. With such young children you being nearer to hand is a hard one to avoid. Particularly if they are feeling bereft. They need you to take care of them. And with an eruption of needs like that within 5 minutes there were minutes before that within which their needs were growing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA big thing is being proactive, and with 6, and you being tired, that&#39;s going to be a difficult rhythm to establish, but it should make life easier over time. If you fill them up before they are needy, before they are melting down, their needs will be less acute. Set up things so that they are easier to access. Look at all the resources you have to hand and see what you can utilise. So a dvd player and a television and a couch and a movie that maybe the 5, 4, and 2 year old enjoy. Or blankets and string and furniture and pillows and you have forts that they can build and crawl in and out of and play around with and your attention and their action. And in the moments when they are having a good time together, or at least not such a big series of needs, you can grab some food and some drinks and have a picnic with them in the fort. Or treasure hunts, Simon and Linnaea loved treasure hunts and easter egg hunts, all year round, or yarn ball forts where they<br/>\n had to move through without touching the yarn, like it was laser alarm systems. They liked physical challenges, running around the house with me counting how long it took for them to get from the bathroom down in the bottom corner of the house to the top floor in a three story house and back to me. It got them moving and used up some of their energy and let me sit and be umpire when I was less energetic. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be times when they are tired and frustrated and you are as well. You aren&#39;t going to be able to cede your focus or attention in the hopes that they will be able to solve their problems. The more you are aware that they are growing bored or tired or frustrated, the better you will be able to step in and help them to move onto something else. Again with 6 of them and 1 of you it will take energy and attention on your part. But having a series of tools that you can use to move them from one thing to another will help. Do an inventory of interesting things in your house. Make them easily accessible and interesting. Part of why the ipad is interesting to your 7 year old is because it is novel. And it isn&#39;t freely available. While looking for money for other computers see if you can find a way to get other sorts of systems to play on. Or other ways to access them. I know people offer free or very cheap pcs on things like Craigslist from time to<br/>\n time, you could also look for a last series ipad there, or an android based touch screen system. You could look for a gamecube with some games, I bet those are fairly cheap. My favourite cooperative play game is on the gamecube, Shrek 2. We still have ours and the many games we gathered over the years and Linnaea&#39;s been revisiting things like Zelda Wind Waker and Sonic games recently. Or a ps2, lots of good games on that system, even if they aren&#39;t modern. You could probably pick up an extra tv from something like craigslist fairly easily, as well, if it would give your kids more access to things to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard when you are tired and depressed to look for ways to reach out to the people in your life who need you. It&#39;s hard to see ways to take a step forward instead of trying just to be still while all things pass. You don&#39;t have the option to be still, though. Or, to be still and quiet and depressed and not have 6 people erupt in moments of need at fairly regular intervals. Being proactive won&#39;t make them not fight, it won&#39;t cause peace to descend upon your house, but it will help to make the moments not so frequent, not so acute. They need you. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can help to find ways to connect with them more. It can help to lift you from feeling low. I say this fairly regularly, but smell their heads, listen to them talking and watch them play. Look at them, not through tired exasperated eyes, but through eyes of wonder and joy and love. When they come to you needy, think about how wonderful it is that you can fill them. You can snuggle up on the couch and watch that same movie again and again with your 4 year old and watch him or her giggle and laugh at the same place each time and fall in love again. You can walk to the kitchen talking to your little one and get him or her a drink of water. You can joke and play and make them smile. You can find a blanket when the other one is desired. You can bring them a plate of peanut butter crackers and know that it is exactly what was missing from that moment. Being a mom is a pretty fabulous thing. Let that fill you up so that in your low moments you can lean on<br/>\n it a little. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nSwitch to: Text-Only, Daily Digest • Unsubscribe • Terms of Use<br/>\n. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":459518685,"authorName":"Jenna Brotherton","from":"Jenna Brotherton &lt;jenna.brotherton@...&gt;","profile":"unschooling_nt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] How to stop being the fixer?

I am ALWAYS available for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1400466613\">Something that I find difficult personally, is letting children sort out their own issues - especially when it becomes physical. I am ALWAYS available for support and comfort, but a lot of the time it&#39;s just not my place to intervene - not unless is child is very obviously being maliciously cornered. But children, especially young children, don&#39;t always have the verbal skills to communicate their feelings, and so the sometimes resort to being physical with each other - and this is a natural stage of development. Children need to do this to learn what is acceptable and what isn&#39;t - and that&#39;s hard for them to learn when there&#39;s always an adult jumping in to prevent outcomes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne very important factor, in relation to possession of items, is for all children to have their own property. Have communal items, sure, but if a child takes an item that BELONGS to another child, then there is a reason for your intervention if the item is not returned. If a child is using a communal item and another child takes it, then you might speak to the child it was taken from (if they come to you for support) and provide guidance on how they might word their request to get the item back. If the request isn&#39;t heeded, depending on the age of the child, you might add a follow-up request directly to the child who has taken the item. If the item STILL isn&#39;t returned... well, personally, I just leave it. I will generally say something to my son like, &quot;I&#39;m sorry honey, I know you really want that item but Bobby has it now.&quot; and then offer to do something with the child to move away from the problem. If my son freaks out, as he sometimes does, I will offer him support and recognition of why he&#39;s so upset, but I won&#39;t physically remove the item from the other child. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother great way to juggle items like the computer/iPad/tv is setting mutually-agreed time limits. If everyone agrees that you can only use the item for half an hour before passing it to the next person, it&#39;s not a rule being created by you. You might offer to be the time-keeper, and you will probably find that is agreeable to the children. However, if those methods don&#39;t work and this is a repeated scenario in your home, I would seriously look at implementing ownership rights. Especially over items that belong to you - the iPad for example, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but if you can&#39;t share, you can&#39;t have it. When you guys work it out between yourselves, please come and see me and we&#39;ll talk about it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecifically:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Derek won&#39;t let me have a drink of water.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would find a way AROUND Derek to get your other child a drink of water, without directly interfering.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I need to harvest my crops (on a game) and Brad won&#39;t give me the ipad!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTime limits on the iPad.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Give me the blanket!&quot; (whap, whap, as the 5 yr old hits the 4 yr old) Screaming starts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would provide comfort to the child who has been hit. If the blanket belongs to the 4-year-old, I would request it, and then retrieve it if it&#39;s not handed over.

They&#39;ve figured it out ;) Help your kids relax and destress in ways that work for them. Bring snacks to the kids playing Minecraft and stop by to pat them and offer then hugs. When you can, spend time close to them so they feel you&#39;re interested in them and care what they&#39;re doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nPJ&#39;s all day... this is a problem? She wants comfort. Pajamas are comfortable. I&#39;ve taken kids out into the world in halloween costumes in May, so pajamas seem really normal to me!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeanut butter is nutritious! My daughter has a very very conservative palate and will go through phases where she only eats one food. It helps me to look at what she&#39;s drinking and make sure there are interesting juices and fun straws. If I get really stressed (like the summer she lived on milk) I offer vitamins. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; the oldest two arguing over whose turn it is on the computer...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Any chance of another computer? That sounds simplistic, in part because it really is the simplest possible solution. It helps to think of computers, in particular, as more than one thing - like a whole library. Would you make one of your kids wait outside the library for the other to go in and look around? See the computer like that, a big, complex resource center.

My husband and I are divorcing.  We have six kids.  I&#39;d like to continue homeschooling and my husband is supportive of that...but I know I can&#39;t do it if we try to go with a more traditional approach, which is why I am looking seriously at unschooling again.  I want our home to be happy, less stressed, and I want my kids to love learning again.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT...I am having a terrible time deschooling myself.  I read about unschooling, etc, and it helps for a while, but then I start feeling like I&#39;m not doing enough.  That - and my kids are driving me crazy.  I had posted on here already about the screaming (from the 4 littlest) but it is also just the constant NEED that everyone has. And the oldest two arguing over whose turn it is on the computer... My dad is encouraging me to look at public school, to give myself a break, but that&#39;s not what I wanted for them.  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two oldest boys have been playing Minecraft online NONSTOP for a couple weeks now.  They are not sleeping a lot and are grouchy.  (13 and 10 years old).  My youngest ones never want to get dressed and prefer to wear their PJ&#39;s all day.  My 5 yo only wants to eat peanut butter crackers and nothing else.  Other people seem to feel I am neglecting them by not forcing them to have a routine, and to do the things that normal people do:  get dressed, eat properly, and DO school, with limited access to electronics; go to bed and get up at certain times, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m asking of you guys.  I guess I am just freaking out a little and asking for some advice, or encouragement or something.  I only get one chance to raise my kids and I don&#39;t want to mess it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKristie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48284,"nextTopicId":48286}}
