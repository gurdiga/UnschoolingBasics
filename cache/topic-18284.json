He s a wonderful guy,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1799431813\">Original post:<br/>\n<br/>\n My dh talks a good unschooling talk (he&#39;s more open about it than I<br/>\n am-lol), but doesn&#39;t always walk the unschooling walk. He&#39;s a<br/>\n wonderful guy, but his anger and his childhood seem to get in the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-==-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  He needs to heal his &quot;own&quot; child before he can be expected to be a <br/>\nparent.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n This occurs several times a month, at least, where he gets tired of<br/>\n the kids roughhousing (running around, chasing each other) usually in<br/>\n play (though, sometimes in dispute). This drives my dh crazy and he<br/>\n blows like a volcano!<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  He needs to find the &quot;point&quot; in advance. Maybe you two could work on <br/>\nit together---find how much is &quot;enough&quot; and use a code word to tell <br/>\neveryone it&#39;s time to stop NOW! Dad&#39;s getting ready to blow.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Duncan can keep going too far. We say &quot;BeeBeep, Duncan&quot; (from Stephen <br/>\nKing&#39;s _It_). He stops immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n He yells at me saying that my parenting isn&#39;t<br/>\n helping, so he&#39;s going to go back to the way that it should be -<br/>\n through fear.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n And...uh....how&#39;s that working for him? Happy home? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n He&#39;s a really big guy, 6&#39;2&quot; and 275 lbs., so when he<br/>\n gets really mad it can be scary. His face gets red and he yells at<br/>\n the top of his voice and then stomps loudly to wherever the kids<br/>\n happen to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Excitable guy? Big? Loud? Extreme highs? Extreme lows? Extreme <br/>\neverything?<br/>\n<br/>\n Deep breathing would be a good start.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then have him pick from TWO actions: yelling OR stomping. Pick the <br/>\nbetter one. Next time, after breathing, have him pick yelling OR <br/>\ngrunting. &lt;g&gt; If he can make just a TINY bit better choice each time, <br/>\nhe&#39;ll eventually get better and better. But to expect him to take more <br/>\nthan a tiny step each time may be waaay too much.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n A couple of times I&#39;ve taken the girls into our bedroom<br/>\n and locked the door, but he busted in the door. He&#39;s never hit them,<br/>\n but has threatened once (by holding up his fist to my older daughter).<br/>\n I&#39;ve been with him over 24 years, and he has never hitten me, either.<br/>\n My older daughter (who is 8 yo.) says he&#39;s scary, but that she knows<br/>\n he wouldn&#39;t hurt her physically.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n  Does he know this? Can you talk about it quietly BEFORE It <br/>\nhappens---like one a long drive or while on a picnic? When you&#39;re both <br/>\ncalm and willing to talk. No kids. Just lots of talking.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Does he KNOW his kids are afraid of him? Does he KNOW he&#39;s creating <br/>\nfear in his girls?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n In all the time that I&#39;ve been with my husband, since he was a teen,<br/>\n he rarely lost his temper, though, since we&#39;ve had kids (especially 2<br/>\n kids), it has increased. Also, my husband&#39;s mom died a little over a<br/>\n year ago and his anger has seemed to have significantly increased<br/>\n since her death.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m going to guess that his childhood wasn&#39;t pleasant---that he has <br/>\nsome unresolved issues with his mom. Her death---and his role as <br/>\nprovider/dad has brought up some hidden problems. Is he willing to <br/>\ntalk? With you? With a shrink? With another dad?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n He also has a very stressful job that he really hates.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, that&#39;s HUGE! What does he do? Maybe one of us has an <br/>\nidea/contact.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n We&#39;ve looked for other jobs, but haven&#39;t found one that<br/>\n doesn&#39;t require at least a significant drop in pay (and currently we<br/>\n have too much debt to consider a large reduction in his pay, though,<br/>\n we are trying to pay off the debt so this can eventually happen).<br/>\n However, we will continue to look for a job. He also sees a therapist<br/>\n every now and then, and although this helps, it is limited in value.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  OK---you answered a couple of my questions. &lt;g&gt; Jump out now. The debt <br/>\ncan wait. Seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Get out of the hellhole. His wellbeing is more important than the $$. <br/>\nThe kids&#39; thoughts of their daddy are more important than $$. Taking <br/>\nthe leap will open doors you never knew existed. Worry about the $$ <br/>\nlater. Seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, I&#39;m at a loss. I&#39;ve tried to empathize, but maybe it&#39;s too<br/>\n little too late. How can I let my kids be kids without my husband<br/>\n losing his temper?<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  By helping him see what he&#39;s doing ---but not WHILE he&#39;s doing it. <br/>\nBEFORE. Code word. Breathing. Choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Let him know that you *want* to help. Help him see what he&#39;s doing and <br/>\nhow it will affect them forever. Does he want them to treat his <br/>\ngrandchildren the way he&#39;s treating *them*? Learning can&#39;t happen in <br/>\nthe presence of fear. Period. Learning STOPS when fear is in charge. <br/>\nYou can&#39;t unschool in fear.<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.
