I&#39;m hoping maybe one of you knows of this<br/>\nbook, or even better has it and can tell me the title or author.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nalready searched with all area librarians, and even school librarians and no<br/>\none seems to be able to help me.  I&#39;m hoping maybe one of you can.  The book<br/>\nis the beautiful story of how every event affects everything.  It begins<br/>\n(and I believe the title had something to do with this first event) with a<br/>\nfrog jumping up out of a pond to try and catch a dragonfly (I believe) to<br/>\neat.  The dragonfly flies up only to be sought by a bird.  Many of the<br/>\nevents following this are very sketchy.  The bird does something that<br/>\naffects a plane.  All of these and other events I can&#39;t recall lead to a<br/>\nwoman in a red hat window shopping.  The hat goes flying, and a man catches<br/>\nit, which as you can guess leads to their chance encounter, them falling in<br/>\nlove and getting married.  (Again more events I can&#39;t recall)  The final<br/>\nevent of the story is the granddaughter of the woman playing dress up or tea<br/>\nparty or something in the backyard wearing the red hat.  The wind once again<br/>\ncatches the hat and blows it into the neighbor&#39;s yard.  The girl climbs the<br/>\nfence to retrieve her hat and finds her neighbor laying face down in the<br/>\nyard.  He had had a heart attack.  In the end the girl saves him and the<br/>\nauthor reiterates how all of this would never had happened had it not been<br/>\nfor the frog swimming in the pond and an unsuspecting dragonfly.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSound familiar to anyone?  This is probably the biggest group of mothers I<br/>\nfeel I can reach, I&#39;m desperately hoping that one of you knows of this book.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help,<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12504,"nextTopicId":12512}}
