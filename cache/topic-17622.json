One of them is the  <br/>\nOpen University in England, for example, which is a distance  <br/>\nuniversity (www.open.ac.uk) and I am sure there are more all around  <br/>\nthe world. And they don&#39;t care at all what kind of graduation you  <br/>\nhave and you can do it next to your job or full time or whatever,  <br/>\nthey even have an &quot;Open Degree&quot;, in which you choose whatever you  <br/>\nwant of all the courses they offer and you just have a &quot;Bachelor&quot;  <br/>\nwithout any specifications, which just states what kind of courses  <br/>\nyou have had. Its just a &quot;prove&quot; that you can work scientifically.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if the unschooled kid WANTS to study or so, he can still do  <br/>\nsomething like that and doesn&#39;t need a graduation from high school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that thought very soothing when I worry if she will &quot;learn  <br/>\nenough&quot;.

That way <br/>\nyou could ask this question and get *many* more responses that *just* <br/>\nthe one I can give you. Not only that, but it would be a daily dose of <br/>\nhow this works in all sorts of families.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been several times to Europe. My older son (Cameron), at 18 has <br/>\nbeen to Australia, throughout continental Europe , and England & <br/>\nScotland already. Right now he&#39;s in Vermont. Two weeks ago, he was in <br/>\nNew Mexico and Arizona. Two weeks before *that* he was in Oregon. He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work for IBM. He&#39;s just recently become an unschooled adult! <br/>\nHe&#39;ll be in NYC in November for a week while studying drumming. We <br/>\ndon&#39;t have all of next year&#39;s travel plans ironed out---but we know <br/>\nhe&#39;ll be on the road.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I think it&#39;s great that your family is getting to travel due <br/>\nto your husband&#39;s job, he could also have had a job in theatre or in <br/>\njournalism and gotten just as much, if not more. possibilities to <br/>\ntravel. Cameron&#39;s drumming will eventually send him around the world, I <br/>\nam sure. He loves to travel!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve gotten to travel without all that much school math. Cameron had <br/>\neven LESS math and has seen even more of the world that I have!<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly you must NOT start at point A and go up in math! Duncan (my <br/>\nten year old) understood algebra and some calculus before he understood <br/>\ndivision just because of the computer game, Zoombini&#39;s! Logic and <br/>\nsequencing come naturally by living and analyzing---NOT by doing <br/>\nworksheet in a &quot;logical&quot; manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour husband chose the math he did because he LIKES it. He&#39;s GOOD at <br/>\nit. The numbers were &quot;calling&quot; him. You may find that numbers say <br/>\n*nothing* special to your children. They may find words or animals or <br/>\nrocks or society more fascinating. THOSE things may take your children <br/>\nplaces. OR they may find that travel doesn&#39;t suit them, and they may <br/>\nwant to stay planted. That won&#39;t mean that their lives aren&#39;t as rich <br/>\nor as interesting---just different.<br/>\n<br/>\nFears will keep showing up until you make hat paradigm shift that says <br/>\nyou TRUST your children and that you TRUST the process of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what unschooling is all about---TRUST RESPECT PATIENCE.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.
