(Long time before I learned of unschooling).  He explained how children learn and how the young eyes worked.  For young children, he said the words needed to be very large(3&quot;) and thicker lined.  He said to just use the word not the letters as letters have no meaning by themselves.  Between the ages of 1-2, I made up cards with the body parts and household stuff and put the body parts over the changing table and the other labels where appropreate.  I didn&#39;t drill my daughter but we did play fun games with them.  (Same as one would play head and shoulders and such with their babies.)  That same child, now sixteen, now labels the house in whatever language she is currently studying (Japanese, Spanish, German, & French..)  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor my son, I would blame video games for most of his learning to read.  I have been amazed at just how much he has learned from the games he plays.  Comics are also an incredible way for kids to learn to read.  My son loves Calvin and Hobbes and On The Rocks  at<br/>\nwww.funbrain.com .  I&#39;d say example is the best way to encourage reading.

She will be 13 in a month. I had noticed that she was reading things online and I had been waiting patiently with trust thanks to the people here and on other lists. I really wanted her to read and enjoy it. I read very early and it is one of my favorite things to do. My desire for her to read was not because I thought that reading is &quot;good for you&quot; &quot;It teaches you&quot; or &quot;how else is she going to LEARN anything?&quot;. I wanted to be able to talk about and share one of my loves with her. If she didn&#39;t share that love, that would have been ok too. We have plenty of things in common even if we don&#39;t share the love of stories.<br/>\nAnyway, I wanted her to understand that for some people, reading is a hobby as well as a tool and can be very enjoyable. So I went to a book store and picked up Are You There God? It&#39;s Me Margaret. By Judy Blume, One of my all time favorite books from when I was a girl.<br/>\nI literally thought, &quot;If this doesn&#39;t work, she&#39;s just not that into it.&quot;<br/>\nShe loved it, read the whole thing. She found joy in reading a story just for fun.<br/>\nShe went on to read more Judy Blume, and then switched to young adult chick lit.<br/>\nCool! fun light books about young women and relationships.<br/>\nEmily is also taking a World history class with some other homeschoolers. She&#39;s the youngest one in the class, most are eclectically schooled teens prepping for college and keeping transcripts. She reads the textbook chapters with ease. What&#39;s amazing is that there are no ulteriors. No have to&#39;s, no deadlines. This is all for fun.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t teach her to read. She learned in the same way that she learned to talk. She listened, she made connections between sounds and body language, she tried making sounds, analyzed the responses, adjusted and tried again.<br/>\nIn reading she listened to sounds coming out of peoples mouths, noticed patterns on paper (or screens) tried decyphering the sounds, analyzed the responses, adjusted and tried again.<br/>\nMy son who is seven is starting this journey. He has been completely unschooled since birth. There is a difference as he is not put off by anything that could remotely be attached to school style learning.I would guess that he will read a little earlier as he had no healing to do.

My 6 year old daughter started reading like she&#39;d been reading for years at age 4.......I don&#39;t think it happens that way for most kids.  My 8 year old really did not start reading until just recently.  She memorized a bunch of words I think just to please her teachers at public school, but she really did not have a grasp on it.  I know plenty of kids in public school that can&#39;t read or are really struggling, so going to school does not guarantee one will read either at a certain prescribed age......which is what schools want them to do.  But the beauty of homeschooling and especially &quot;unschooling&quot; is the child can do it on &quot;their&quot; schedule, not someone elses.  A really good recent example is my 8 year old with Math.  In public school she hated it and stunk at it.  I think because she always felt stressed and under pressure to get the math done.  Now she will sit and play with<br/>\n Math manipulatives for hours, and get a blank piece of paper and write math problems down by the dozens.......all on her own, nothing to do with me asking her.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Recently I read an article about how &quot;playing&quot; has been lost in our society.  It said parents are so busy &quot;overscheduling&quot; their kids with hockey, karate, dance lesson, etc. that they don&#39;t realize their kids need to just play.  The best memories I had as a child were of &quot;playing&quot;.  When my girls were in school, and would come home to a bunch of homework I kept asking &quot;when do they get to play? and just be kids?&quot;  I had many reasons to pull them out of school, but one of those reasons was so that they could just play.  My kids are gonna have plenty of time when they are adults to be stressed out and worried about bills, and all those adult things.  Right now I just want them to be kids, and do kid things.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Oh, those phone calls from relatives are just wonderful aren&#39;t they?  My MIL, who also drinks tos much also calls us and all kinds of things come out of her unfiltered mouth.....one of them being how much she disagrees with us over the homeschooling.

I don&#39;t want my child to feel &#39;less&#39;.  (and believe me, no more unsupervised visits with g/ma for a while, cuz she&#39;ll be the one to make him feel that way, like somethings wrong with him).  <br/>\nI know nothing is wrong with him.  I truly know that.  I just want to make sure I am doing everything I can to help him.  I read about all the amazing things people on this list are doing, what they&#39;re children are up to and interested in, and I feel like I&#39;m falling short.  <br/>\nI&#39;m not devaluing what my children enjoy doing, which is simply playing.  <br/>\nWhat I need is a hug and a pat on the back, and some words of calming wisdom.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Deb &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:soggyboysmom@...\">soggyboysmom@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 17, 2006 11:05:41 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Learning to read...<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it actually &quot;works&quot; - I&#39;ve got an 8 yr old who has never been <br/>\nschooled and he is doing just fine.

Lots  <br/>\nof people do but they shouldn&#39;t. It just makes them unhappy and makes  <br/>\nthe 5 1/2 yos who can&#39;t unhappy and rewards the ones who can for  <br/>\nsomething they have no control over. It&#39;s like celebrating a 9 mo who  <br/>\ncan walk as though they had some choice about it and being upset with  <br/>\na 18 mo who can&#39;t as though *they* had a choice about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it. Why would a 5 yo need to read or write to do 5 yo  <br/>\nthings?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat people fear is that it takes years of practice to learn to read  <br/>\nand write. But that&#39;s only true if kids are forced to do reading  <br/>\npractice when they don&#39;t want to or need to and before they&#39;re really  <br/>\nready to even make it work.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids typically pick up reading anywhere between 4-12.  <br/>\n(Some even a bit earlier. Some even a bit later.) But an unschooled  <br/>\nchild who learns at 12 isn&#39;t 8 years behind a 12 yo who learned at 4.  <br/>\nWithin a few months the later reader is reading at age level just  <br/>\nlike the earlier reader. Soon they&#39;re indistinguishable from each  <br/>\nother. Just as no one can tell which person walked at 9 mos and which  <br/>\nwalked at 18 mos.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I am<br/>\n&gt; concerned about is will he really learn to read by living life and<br/>\n&gt; having stories read to him?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. As long as he doesn&#39;t feel your worry or pressure from you that  <br/>\nwould attach unpleasant feelings to reading. Make the experience  <br/>\npleasurable for him. Give him good associations with the written word.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do I need to sit down with him and<br/>\n&gt; teach him about phonics etc..?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ick. No.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he asks, just answer his questions simply. If you know a clever  <br/>\ntrick, pass it along but judge by his attitude how much of that he  <br/>\nfinds interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know I need to trust in my kids<br/>\n&gt; but it seems hard to believe that they can learn the basics in<br/>\n&gt; reading, writing and arithmetic through unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, yeah, it&#39;s hard to believe. We *have* to believe the rigors of  <br/>\nschool are necessary or all that time and effort we spent in school  <br/>\nand doing work for school was wasted. To stay sane, kids buy into the  <br/>\nbelief too. Otherwise they know they&#39;re wasting their childhoods :- <br/>\n( The really unhappy, angry ones never accept that delusion. Not sure  <br/>\nwhich of those two choices is better :-/<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately they&#39;re not the only two choices!<br/>\n<br/>\nMath, I think, is the hardest because real life math bears very  <br/>\nlittle resemblance to school math. And when it does resemble school  <br/>\nmath, there&#39;s so little of it -- considering all the hours and hours  <br/>\nof instruction and practice we did in school -- that it&#39;s a drip when  <br/>\nwe think they need an ocean.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut real math is about learning how numbers work, not memorizing  <br/>\nabstract facts about them. Real math is absorbing what percentages  <br/>\nare useful for from video games and shopping and art software and  <br/>\ncomputers. It&#39;s learning how fluid numbers are and how they can be  <br/>\nmanipulated to give you the answer you&#39;re trying to get to. (E.g.,  <br/>\nit&#39;s a whole lot more difficult to add 97+26 in your head than it is  <br/>\nto recognize that 97 could easily be turned into 100 by taking 3 from  <br/>\n26 and turning the problem into 100+23.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unschooling, kids learn math theory. They truly understand what  <br/>\nnumbers do (and can do) in a practical gut-feeling way. Picking up  <br/>\nthe formal notation for what they already understand is then very  <br/>\neasy. Kids in school have to work so hard because they don&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand what the purpose of it is. They&#39;re basically practicing to  <br/>\nget it in by rote. Schools *hope* that they&#39;ll develop an  <br/>\nunderstanding but there&#39;s no guarantee.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for writing, once he&#39;s a teen (and often before!) and is IMing and  <br/>\nplaying online video games and emailing friends, he&#39;ll *have to*  <br/>\nfigure out the essence of communicating through the written word  <br/>\nbecause he&#39;ll be writing for  a real purpose: to get his thoughts  <br/>\ninto someone else. It probably won&#39;t look like &quot;real&quot; writing but it  <br/>\nwill be the important essence of it. And the technical aspects of  <br/>\npunctuation are easily learned. But also offer to take dictation of  <br/>\nany stories he wants to tell. If he wants to illustrate them, print  <br/>\nthem out with lots of room for pictures and bind them up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does it<br/>\n&gt; actually work?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, actually, all our kids are total nincompoops and the percentage  <br/>\nof unschoolers who have gone onto college or hold a job is so small  <br/>\nas to be laughable ;-) We just think the philosophy is really cool  <br/>\nand want to spread it around even though it doesn&#39;t work. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Learning to read...","postDate":"1161106650","msgId":18364,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVCNENGMjFELUNDNDYtNDhGQy1CNkExLTc0MUI5NUE0NkZDOEBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVoMzJoNStwb21vQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVoMzJoNStwb21vQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18362,"nextInTopic":18369,"prevInTime":18363,"nextInTime":18365,"topicId":18359,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve got a five yo right now who is learning to read, without teaching.
