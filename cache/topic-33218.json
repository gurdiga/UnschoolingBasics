He saids that he got a flint from wal-mart made by ozark camping supplies and some steel(any modern knife) will work fine for starting a primitive fire.  You-Tube has many videos on primitive fire starting which are more probable to be used in a survival situation since we don&#39;t tend to carry around flint and tender.  He saids also to look at the videos on how to make char cloth to make primitive fires.  My kids had a great time with this.  It was wonderful to watch their faces when they actually got their fires started.  Hope this helps.
