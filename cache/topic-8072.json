Our close friends have a  <br/>\nmini-Dach, and are friends with the breeder. Zoe is a wonderful dog, we went  <br/>\ncamping with her this past summer. The breeder had another litter ready to go,  <br/>\nZoe&#39;s 1/2 siblings. So, they got another one and told us there were some <br/>\nleft.  We went and looked and ended up getting this cute little double-dappled <br/>\nlong  haired girl. So, since our friends live only about 2 mins away and we see <br/>\nthem a  lot, all 3 girls will be together often. The breeder was thrilled to <br/>\nknow that.  We&#39;ll do puppy classes together, and my son has assumed <br/>\nresponsibility of  Isabelle, which is really wonderful. I&#39;m impressed by his actions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJenny<br/>\nUnschooling in Greenfield, MA<br/>\nDanny (12-1-99), Kelsey  (11-1-01) and Evelyn  (5-19-04)<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br/>\nThe  important thing is not so much that every child should be taught, as <br/>\nthat every  child should be given the wish to learn.  ~John  Lubbock<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: OT: Dog grooming?","postDate":"1133897527","msgId":8075,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRuNG92bityZGhhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDN0M4QUMwRkZCQkVFMi00NDgtNTRGQkBNQkxLLU0wMS5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":8073,"nextInTopic":8076,"prevInTime":8074,"nextInTime":8076,"topicId":8072,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
