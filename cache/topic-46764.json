Private and postsecondary schools are hot topics this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be plenty to dig into in the weeks to come, but I wanted to draw your attention to the easily overlooked Indicator 21 on the transition from high school to college. It shows that, overall, students have become more likely to enroll directly in a two- or four-year college by the fall after high school graduation: 70 percent of graduating seniors did so in 2009-2010, up from 62 percent in 2001 and only 51 percent back in 1975.<br/>\n<br/>\n. . .[C]olleges are also trying to give a smoother road to students who don&#39;t take the normal transition to college. More two- and four-year colleges are offering first-year seminars, mentoring, and special programs for students who come late or part-time, particularly those from groups at risk of not graduating, such as adult learners, veterans and first-generation college students. Even higher education research has started to devote more attention to breaking out different types of students, rather than simply looking at the broad groups of &#39;traditional&#39; and &#39;nontraditional,&#39; she said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;We&#39;re beginning to adjust to thinking about a wider range of incoming students,&#39; Ms. Keup said.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":313848170,"authorName":"Kristin","from":"Kristin &lt;strawberrytech@...&gt;","profile":"red_11201","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: College questions WAS Trying to find post","postDate":"1306381600","msgId":46774,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJENURFMUQ2LUUzODAtNDM0RS05QkJGLTE1QjUyNUU5QkQwRUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGlyazlvditpM2NrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlyazlvditpM2NrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46773,"nextInTopic":46775,"prevInTime":46773,"nextInTime":46775,"topicId":46764,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s like the uncollege movement...I ve been following that kid for a while and think it absolutely makes sense..
