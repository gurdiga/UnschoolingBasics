We&#39;ve been homeschooling<br/>\nfor 3 years now. And I&#39;m just figuring out what I&#39;m<br/>\ndoing. I for 2 years brought the classroom into the<br/>\nhome and it was horrible. It was like pulling teeth<br/>\nout for all of us. And it was stressful. Finally I got<br/>\nbetter info and started to really study about<br/>\nhomeschooling and found out there is so much out<br/>\nthere. The unschooling approach is more what I&#39;m<br/>\nlooking for. I&#39;ve let things go finally this year and<br/>\njust let the kids lead  me and to my surprise my kids<br/>\nhave come to me with ideas and we just go from there.<br/>\nIt feels like we&#39;re actually learning things and<br/>\ninjoying what we&#39;re learning and nobody is protesting<br/>\nanymore. Is this unschooling? My oldest really freaked<br/>\nout at first because  she&#39;s used to text books, and my<br/>\nteacher says this, or my teacher says that. And I tell<br/>\nher I am her teacher and that we&#39;re all learning <br/>\ntogether.  Well it is working. <br/>\n I hope this is the right group to be a part of. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for reading this, <br/>\n  Mila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
