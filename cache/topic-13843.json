He also realized that school shouldn&#39;t define him and<br/>\nall that goes with that knowledge.  He attended some of the talks with<br/>\nhis dad and liked Ben&#39;s &quot;Dad&quot; talk especially.  &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is really great to hear!

I truly expected that after a while <br/>\nthe kids would ask to do schoolwork.  I just didn&#39;t really <br/>\nunderstand unschooling.  I had joined some groups like this one, <br/>\nmaybe even this one as well, and  as I learned more, I had no <br/>\nconfidence in either my children nor myself to just let go of the <br/>\nway I thought things should be.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still reading all the posts, but wanted to respond here.   SO <br/>\nmany of you have expressed things in a way I agree with.  Being a <br/>\nnewbie, I wanted to add that when I first saw the word unschooling, <br/>\nI thought &quot;NO WAY!&quot;.  (for the record, I initially thought that way <br/>\nabout homeschooling, &quot;no way could I be at home teaching my daughter <br/>\nall day!&quot;).  BUT, that was because I knew VERY LITTLE about <br/>\nhomeschooling and other options.   SO, being the reader and digger <br/>\nthat I am, I started my internet searches, reading every book I <br/>\ncould get my hands on (amazon.com loves me!  I borrowed some from <br/>\nthe library, but I love to own them so I can make notes in the <br/>\nmargins if so moved, underline passages etc).   I kept coming across <br/>\nunschooling, pushed it aside, came across it again and again.   Even <br/>\nthough I initially thought no way, there was something that stuck <br/>\nwith me, especially after reading Dumbing us Down (John Holt and <br/>\nJohn Taylor Gatto especially made the lightbulb go off).   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt took about 2 years of reading, absorbing, mind altering, before I <br/>\nfound this group (I actually started on one of those &quot;more critical&quot; <br/>\ngroups someone alluded to here and was &quot;criticized&quot; on my first <br/>\npost.  I was pissed, but I now realize I needed to become more <br/>\nfamiliar with unschooling, and to work on changing my perceptions <br/>\nabout unschooling, I really had NO CLUE, especially radical <br/>\nunschooling.   Yes, it&#39;s very misunderstood unless you do the work <br/>\nto really get it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nChange is hard.   I feel that those who have posted and attacked <br/>\nhere don&#39;t know much about unschooling, and as Kelly and others have <br/>\nstated, want the group to lead them through it.   You have to do the <br/>\nwork yourself.   You have to be ready to make the shift in how you <br/>\nlive your lives, and get past your past and how YOU were brought <br/>\nup.   I agree that there are some people who won&#39;t ever be able to <br/>\ndo that, you have to WANT to change and live your life more freely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll admit that sometimes in the past I have felt envious of those <br/>\nhere who have &quot;always unschooled&quot;, but I&#39;ve found the more I read, <br/>\nthe more natural it feels.   In order to hear the advice so freely <br/>\ngiven here (and I&#39;ll add my thank you for being here to the others!)<br/>\nI have to continue to work on it on my end.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany things have been swirling around in my head recently that I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen wanting to express but have felt SO foggy!   So many of you <br/>\nhave written things that have helped me through this blah period <br/>\n(and this after just attending my first conference!  Go figure - <br/>\nI&#39;ll blame it on PMS).  I don&#39;t always have eloquent things to say, <br/>\nbut I DO get SO MUCH from what others write.

I <br/>\nhad joined some groups like this one, maybe even this one as well, and <br/>\nas I learned more, I had no confidence in either my children nor <br/>\nmyself to just let go of the way I thought things should be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoy, I wish I knew what I know now.

I&#39;ve had some <br/>\ntwinges of doubt, and longing for curriculum (I&#39;m a former curriculum <br/>\njunkie) but every time I start looking at stuff for sale, it just all <br/>\nlooks so stupid and so wrong.  I&#39;m thinking that maybe I&#39;m finally <br/>\ngetting it and living it.

Anyone even remotely interested in unschooling today will<br/>\nget 456,000 Google hits from one search.   There&#39;s Life Learning Magazine<br/>\nand Live Free Learn Free.  There&#39;s the e-zine Connections.  There&#39;s the<br/>\n.info unschooling message board and web site. There are web sites and<br/>\nblogs up the wazoo.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***The one thing that gets me, many of you old timers tell us newbies to<br/>\nbe patient, to be loving and understanding and supportive---but when a<br/>\nnewbie parent comes here freaking out because this is new and their<br/>\nchildren<br/>\nare doing the usual stuck on TV or video games and its new and scary to<br/>\nthem---they get chatised and judged for reacting and worrying. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe responsibility to do the initial research, to discover if unschooling<br/>\nseems like something they can do, lies with the newbie.   It&#39;s not our<br/>\njob to convince them.  It&#39;s not our responsibility to make sure they get<br/>\nall the information.   We can help people understand how the principles<br/>\napply to real life situations.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***If this lifestyle is about nurturing and<br/>\nbeing supportive, why does that stop at other adults???  ***  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t and many, many people get the support and help they need at<br/>\nthese types of lists.   But some people want more than that.  They want<br/>\nus to do the work for them and that isn&#39;t possible.    <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who takes even one hour out of their day to respond on these lists<br/>\nis spending that hour with an adult who could feasibly get that<br/>\ninformation reading at anyone of the various web sites or in the archives<br/>\nof these great lists.   That&#39;s an hour away from our own kids.  We&#39;re<br/>\nmostly glad to do it because we *do* remember how alone we felt in the<br/>\nbeginning, how hard it was for us to find information.   But it&#39;s<br/>\ndifferent now.  There&#39;s a lot of information available for free.    We<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to be as nurturing with an adult who&#39;s had years of experience<br/>\nnavigating in this world and who has Internet access as we need to be<br/>\nwith our kids.   I&#39;m not afraid to say it right up front.  I don&#39;t feel<br/>\nthe need to nurture anyone on these lists in the same way I feel the need<br/>\nto nurture my kid.  List members have other resources available to them<br/>\nbut my kid has only one mom. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I think it is in everyone&#39;s best interest to be caring and<br/>\nsupportive.***<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think the people who volunteer on this list are the most caring and<br/>\nsupportive people around.   This list wouldn&#39;t even exists if  Kelly and<br/>\nRen didn&#39;t care.   It&#39;s because they care they give away their time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while I will always be supportive of unschooling I don&#39;t have any<br/>\nresponsibility to be supportive of mom&#39;s who are too afraid or too whiny<br/>\nto do the internal work they need to do to really understand the<br/>\nprinciples of unschooling.   I&#39;m not interested in being supportive of<br/>\npeople who don&#39;t want to (or who make excuses about why they can&#39;t)<br/>\nunschool.   I&#39;m not going to hunt them down and obliterate them,&lt;g&gt; but<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to spend my time (because I have no time advantage&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\ndigging around inside them looking for the &quot;on&quot; switch.   I think they<br/>\nshould have flipped it before they came here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is meta-discussion.   My answer as moderator to a violation of list<br/>\npolicy is to put anyone who continues this on moderation and stop those<br/>\nposts at the queue.     My answer to you in particular is this:   Post<br/>\nthe way you think is best.  Offer the support and nurturing you think<br/>\neach particular newbie needs.  Be the positive force you want to see<br/>\nhere.   If that still isn&#39;t good enough, start your own list of nurturing<br/>\nsupport and feel free to advertise the link here.   Then, when you see<br/>\nsomeone here in need of your kind of list you can direct them there.  <br/>\nThat would be one more resource for newbies that those advantaged<br/>\nold-timers didn&#39;t have. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\nSecondary<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Secondary+school+education&w1=Secondary\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Secondary+school+education&w1=Secondary</a><br/>\n+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=G<br/>\nraduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+e<br/>\nducation&c=6&s=185&.sig=ZmtJ9eV8jDgLVf_rQitp3g&gt; school education<br/>\nGraduate<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Secondary+\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Secondary+</a><br/>\nschool+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Gr<br/>\naduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+ed<br/>\nucation&c=6&s=185&.sig=_ar44lA2aVf7qUVJT2dfbA&gt; school education \tHome<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Secondary+scho\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Secondary+scho</a><br/>\nol+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Gradua<br/>\nte+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+educat<br/>\nion&c=6&s=185&.sig=igfV0UPAcfSvC6KUmUYY6w&gt; school education \t<br/>\nGraduate<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education+online&w1=Sec\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education+online&w1=Sec</a><br/>\nondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+educatio<br/>\nn&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+sc<br/>\nhool+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=OHt1qK6J19R35_4ff-oJHg&gt; school education<br/>\nonline \tHigh<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Secondary+scho\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Secondary+scho</a><br/>\nol+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Gradua<br/>\nte+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+educat<br/>\nion&c=6&s=185&.sig=BV3EOkp5uIRJ0eqRAZQNcw&gt; school education \tChicago<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Chicago+school+education&w1=Secondary+s\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Chicago+school+education&w1=Secondary+s</a><br/>\nchool+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Gra<br/>\nduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+edu<br/>\ncation&c=6&s=185&.sig=pesFSb8HMcPS2_oNEoEwuw&gt; school education \t<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!

There&#39;s the e-zine Connections.  There&#39;s the<br/>\n.info unschooling message board and web site. There are web sites and<br/>\nblogs up the wazoo.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***The one thing that gets me, many of you old timers tell us newbies to<br/>\nbe patient, to be loving and understanding and supportive---but when a<br/>\nnewbie parent comes here freaking out because this is new and their<br/>\nchildren<br/>\nare doing the usual stuck on TV or video games and its new and scary to<br/>\nthem---they get chatised and judged for reacting and worrying. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe responsibility to do the initial research, to discover if unschooling<br/>\nseems like something they can do, lies with the newbie.   It&#39;s not our<br/>\njob to convince them.  It&#39;s not our responsibility to make sure they get<br/>\nall the information.   We can help people understand how the principles<br/>\napply to real life situations.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***If this lifestyle is about nurturing and<br/>\nbeing supportive, why does that stop at other adults???  ***  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t and many, many people get the support and help they need at<br/>\nthese types of lists.   But some people want more than that.  They want<br/>\nus to do the work for them and that isn&#39;t possible.    <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who takes even one hour out of their day to respond on these lists<br/>\nis spending that hour with an adult who could feasibly get that<br/>\ninformation reading at anyone of the various web sites or in the archives<br/>\nof these great lists.   That&#39;s an hour away from our own kids.  We&#39;re<br/>\nmostly glad to do it because we *do* remember how alone we felt in the<br/>\nbeginning, how hard it was for us to find information.   But it&#39;s<br/>\ndifferent now.  There&#39;s a lot of information available for free.    We<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to be as nurturing with an adult who&#39;s had years of experience<br/>\nnavigating in this world and who has Internet access as we need to be<br/>\nwith our kids.   I&#39;m not afraid to say it right up front.  I don&#39;t feel<br/>\nthe need to nurture anyone on these lists in the same way I feel the need<br/>\nto nurture my kid.  List members have other resources available to them<br/>\nbut my kid has only one mom. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I think it is in everyone&#39;s best interest to be caring and<br/>\nsupportive.***<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think the people who volunteer on this list are the most caring and<br/>\nsupportive people around.   This list wouldn&#39;t even exists if  Kelly and<br/>\nRen didn&#39;t care.   It&#39;s because they care they give away their time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while I will always be supportive of unschooling I don&#39;t have any<br/>\nresponsibility to be supportive of mom&#39;s who are too afraid or too whiny<br/>\nto do the internal work they need to do to really understand the<br/>\nprinciples of unschooling.   I&#39;m not interested in being supportive of<br/>\npeople who don&#39;t want to (or who make excuses about why they can&#39;t)<br/>\nunschool.   I&#39;m not going to hunt them down and obliterate them,&lt;g&gt; but<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to spend my time (because I have no time advantage&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\ndigging around inside them looking for the &quot;on&quot; switch.   I think they<br/>\nshould have flipped it before they came here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is meta-discussion.   My answer as moderator to a violation of list<br/>\npolicy is to put anyone who continues this on moderation and stop those<br/>\nposts at the queue.     My answer to you in particular is this:   Post<br/>\nthe way you think is best.  Offer the support and nurturing you think<br/>\neach particular newbie needs.  Be the positive force you want to see<br/>\nhere.   If that still isn&#39;t good enough, start your own list of nurturing<br/>\nsupport and feel free to advertise the link here.   Then, when you see<br/>\nsomeone here in need of your kind of list you can direct them there.  <br/>\nThat would be one more resource for newbies that those advantaged<br/>\nold-timers didn&#39;t have. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244909672,"authorName":"freepsgal","from":"&quot;freepsgal&quot; &lt;freepsgal@...&gt;","profile":"freepsgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Hating homeschooling & unparenting","postDate":"1149256580","msgId":13908,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU1cGcyNCszaHJmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDODUzQjJEN0RCMDFCMy0yN0MtMTFCQUBNQkxLLU0yMy5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":13907,"nextInTopic":13910,"prevInTime":13907,"nextInTime":13909,"topicId":13843,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

What they may truly<br/>\nbe looking for is &quot;Interest Led Learning&quot; or &quot;Child Directed Learning&quot; not<br/>\nrealizing that *Unschooling* is more than a curriculum choice.  They still<br/>\nwant to make sure that their kids have all their 3R&#39;s covered as well as<br/>\nsome science, geography and politcal science thrown in.  So while we that<br/>\nhave become comfortable with *unschooling* can see that *everything* is a<br/>\nlearning experience (even if we don&#39;t categorize it as such), others want<br/>\nlearning to be everything.  IOW they want to make sure that their child is<br/>\nlearning something &quot;educational.&quot; So I think that this list does get a lot<br/>\nof traffic from people who are looking for something different.  And that is<br/>\nfine.  Just don&#39;t mess up the list by condemning all unschoolers as<br/>\n&quot;unparents.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving been in &quot;the system&quot; for several years before coming to homeschooling<br/>\nand eventually unschooling, I can tell you that there is a whole lot more<br/>\n&quot;unparenting&quot; going on in traditional mainstream homes these days than in<br/>\nunschooling homes.  Parents who are allowing &quot;the system&quot; to raise their<br/>\nchildren and aren&#39;t taking responsibility for poor behaviour, teen<br/>\npregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse and bullying.

This is a<br/>\n  totally new way of life, not just unschooling, but a complete change <br/>\nof how<br/>\n  to raise children and it is daunting to someone who was raised a <br/>\ncertain way<br/>\n  and needs to change their whole way of thinking. The way some of you <br/>\ntalk,<br/>\n  it should be easy and natural and we are terrible parents if we don&#39;t <br/>\nfall<br/>\n  into it right away---I know you don&#39;t actually think that BUT the way <br/>\nsome<br/>\n  of you respond to newbies asking questions, it sure looks as if you <br/>\nbelieve<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  No, I believe that it&#39;s hard as hell. Simple, but not easy. Hard as <br/>\nhell!<br/>\n<br/>\n  ANd I don&#39;t think *any* of us were raised that much differently. I&#39;d <br/>\nsay the majority of us (Pam S is probably the exception) were raised <br/>\ntraditionally with much of the same baggage.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Even with all the baggage I started with, I *know* it&#39;s possible! ANd <br/>\nI also know that every minute you waste *fighting* it is another minute <br/>\nyou could have been using to enjoy your children and unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing that gets me, many of you old timers tell us newbies to<br/>\nbe patient, to be loving and understanding and supportive---but when a<br/>\n  newbie parent comes here freaking out because this is new and their <br/>\nchildren<br/>\nare doing the usual stuck on TV or video games and its new and scary to<br/>\nthem---they get chatised and judged for reacting and worrying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yeah--I struggle with that. And with other contradictions in my life. <br/>\n&quot;Hurry up!&quot; and &quot;Be patient---what&#39;s your hurry?&quot; I say those at the <br/>\nsame time &lt;g&gt; But the fact is: you only have a *very* limited amount of <br/>\ntime with your children. If you keep waiting, that child will be grown <br/>\nand gone!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve never met someone who has *gotten* unschooling to whine, &quot;I wish <br/>\nI had waited longer to get it!&quot; It&#39;s ALWAYS, &quot;I wish I&#39;d gotten this <br/>\nsooner!&quot; That includes *me*!<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, I want you to be patient and understanding of what your *child* is <br/>\ngoing through---but if I&#39;m *just* as patient and understanding with <br/>\n*you* (and I&#39;m really more patient and understanding than you think! <br/>\n&lt;bwg&gt;), you may remain *stuck* for much, much longer ---and undo all <br/>\nyou&#39;re working on with your child!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I KNOW how scary this is. but if I were to keep holding your hand and <br/>\nsay, &quot;It&#39;s OK, take your time&quot;....time&#39;s *gone* before you know it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t waste another second!

Not many people leave this list. It&#39;s all about fear. <br/>\nFearing the unknown, what&#39;s different, what&#39;s strange. We all have <br/>\nfears, but wallowing in them---especially with unschooling---will not <br/>\ntake you further on the journey.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Relatively speaking (! &lt;g&gt;) this is the gentlest place to figure this <br/>\nout. But if you think understanding unschooling is hard, try explaining <br/>\nit to family, friends, and strangers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is NOT a journey for wimps! You really DO have to be strong to <br/>\nstand up for your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If they run away because they can&#39;t handle *my* heat &lt;g&gt;, they <br/>\nprobably couldn&#39;t stand up to a Mil&#39;s or a neighbor&#39;s heat---or even <br/>\ntheir own selves!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Not that that&#39;s my goal (to chase them away), but this is NOT easy! It <br/>\ntakes a certain personality to handle being on the outside almost *all* <br/>\nthe time (except at conferences! &lt;G&gt;)!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  If this lifestyle is about nurturing and being supportive, why does <br/>\nthat stop at other adults???<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst: I ain&#39;t your mama!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Second: I&#39;m happy to nurture and support, but only if you&#39;re working <br/>\ntowards the goal. If you&#39;re fighting every step of the way, I&#39;ll let <br/>\nyou stop---and even run back to where it&#39;s safe. I can&#39;t stop you! <br/>\n*Many* people can&#39;t or won&#39;t make this trip. They&#39;re not strong enough. <br/>\nThey have too much baggage and can&#39;t drop any of it by the side of the <br/>\nroad.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I only want to help those who are *interested* in changing. I can&#39;t <br/>\nmake you follow me. I *can* make this path seem attractive enough for <br/>\nyou, smoother, and with fewer rocks. I can show you ways to lighten <br/>\nyour load. I can help toss shit aside. I can give you some tips on how <br/>\nto breathe better or work your legs a bit to build up muscles you never <br/>\nknew you had.

You have to *want* to <br/>\ngo there! You have to *want* to make the change. I&#39;m not going to pull <br/>\nyou along or even carry you. YOU have to take the steps.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess I could stop and sit down with you and hold your hand and <br/>\ncommiserate with how hard the journey is, but that won&#39;t get you *any* <br/>\nfurther along. It slows you down. And if I commiserate long <br/>\nenough---you may simply decide that the journey&#39;s been long enough and <br/>\nput a leaky tent up right where you are. There&#39;s a beautiful, sparkling <br/>\nunschooling city *just* around the corner. But I can&#39;t make you go <br/>\nthere. It&#39;s up to *YOU*.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  It sounds like so many of you are wonderful parents but shouldn&#39;t that <br/>\nextend into being a<br/>\n  supportive human being---expecially on a list called unschooling <br/>\nbasics???<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Really, Leslie, if you&#39;re not getting the help you&#39;re looking for <br/>\nhere, you don&#39;t have to stay. If you feel you can do a better job, you <br/>\ncan form your own list. It&#39;s a lot easier to sit on the sidewalks and <br/>\nwatch others get pushed beyond what they ever felt possible while <br/>\ncriticizing the coaches than it is to show up every day and help people <br/>\non the journey---but hey---whatever floats your boat.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCan&#39;t people be helped without being judged or ridiculed?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sure.

What they may truly<br/>\nbe looking for is &quot;Interest Led Learning&quot; or &quot;Child Directed Learning&quot; not<br/>\nrealizing that *Unschooling* is more than a curriculum choice.  They still<br/>\nwant to make sure that their kids have all their 3R&#39;s covered as well as<br/>\nsome science, geography and politcal science thrown in.  So while we that<br/>\nhave become comfortable with *unschooling* can see that *everything* is a<br/>\nlearning experience (even if we don&#39;t categorize it as such), others want<br/>\nlearning to be everything.  IOW they want to make sure that their child is<br/>\nlearning something &quot;educational.&quot; So I think that this list does get a lot<br/>\nof traffic from people who are looking for something different.  And that is<br/>\nfine.  Just don&#39;t mess up the list by condemning all unschoolers as<br/>\n&quot;unparents.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving been in &quot;the system&quot; for several years before coming to homeschooling<br/>\nand eventually unschooling, I can tell you that there is a whole lot more<br/>\n&quot;unparenting&quot; going on in traditional mainstream homes these days than in<br/>\nunschooling homes.  Parents who are allowing &quot;the system&quot; to raise their<br/>\nchildren and aren&#39;t taking responsibility for poor behaviour, teen<br/>\npregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse and bullying.  Their children truly are<br/>\nbecoming &quot;zombie faced&quot; in front of the tv&#39;s because there is no life beyond<br/>\nschool and &quot;the box.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Hating homeschooling & unparenting","postDate":"1149253733","msgId":13898,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDODU0NUNENTBDN0Q2OC0xNjA4LTJBN0RAbWJsay1yNDMuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTExNS1EQVYxMzVBM0IwQTc5NTY5MzU4MzBFQkZFRDM5MTBAcGh4LmdibD4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwNjAyMTIwMzU5LktYUEYxNTc5Ny5lYXN0cm1tdGFvMDMuY294Lm5ldEBtYXJzYWlsaT4gPEJBWTExNS1EQVYxMzVBM0IwQTc5NTY5MzU4MzBFQkZFRDM5MTBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":13896,"nextInTopic":13900,"prevInTime":13897,"nextInTime":13899,"topicId":13843,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

This is a<br/>\n  totally new way of life, not just unschooling, but a complete change <br/>\nof how<br/>\n  to raise children and it is daunting to someone who was raised a <br/>\ncertain way<br/>\n  and needs to change their whole way of thinking. The way some of you <br/>\ntalk,<br/>\n  it should be easy and natural and we are terrible parents if we don&#39;t <br/>\nfall<br/>\n  into it right away---I know you don&#39;t actually think that BUT the way <br/>\nsome<br/>\n  of you respond to newbies asking questions, it sure looks as if you <br/>\nbelieve<br/>\n it.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  No, I believe that it&#39;s hard as hell. Simple, but not easy. Hard as <br/>\nhell!<br/>\n<br/>\n  ANd I don&#39;t think *any* of us were raised that much differently. I&#39;d <br/>\nsay the majority of us (Pam S is probably the exception) were raised <br/>\ntraditionally with much of the same baggage.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Even with all the baggage I started with, I *know* it&#39;s possible! ANd <br/>\nI also know that every minute you waste *fighting* it is another minute <br/>\nyou could have been using to enjoy your children and unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n The one thing that gets me, many of you old timers tell us newbies to<br/>\n be patient, to be loving and understanding and supportive---but when a<br/>\n  newbie parent comes here freaking out because this is new and their <br/>\nchildren<br/>\n are doing the usual stuck on TV or video games and its new and scary to<br/>\n them---they get chatised and judged for reacting and worrying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yeah--I struggle with that. And with other contradictions in my life. <br/>\n&quot;Hurry up!&quot; and &quot;Be patient---what&#39;s your hurry?&quot; I say those at the <br/>\nsame time &lt;g&gt; But the fact is: you only have a *very* limited amount of <br/>\ntime with your children. If you keep waiting, that child will be grown <br/>\nand gone!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve never met someone who has *gotten* unschooling to whine, &quot;I wish <br/>\nI had waited longer to get it!&quot; It&#39;s ALWAYS, &quot;I wish I&#39;d gotten this <br/>\nsooner!&quot; That includes *me*!<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, I want you to be patient and understanding of what your *child* is <br/>\ngoing through---but if I&#39;m *just* as patient and understanding with <br/>\n*you* (and I&#39;m really more patient and understanding than you think! <br/>\n&lt;bwg&gt;), you may remain *stuck* for much, much longer ---and undo all <br/>\nyou&#39;re working on with your child!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I KNOW how scary this is. but if I were to keep holding your hand and <br/>\nsay, &quot;It&#39;s OK, take your time&quot;....time&#39;s *gone* before you know it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Don&#39;t waste another second! Fake it &#39;til you make it if you have to!<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-==<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think that people go running away because of the way they are <br/>\nresponded to, not because<br/>\n of their fear of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Think again. Not many people leave this list. It&#39;s all about fear. <br/>\nFearing the unknown, what&#39;s different, what&#39;s strange. We all have <br/>\nfears, but wallowing in them---especially with unschooling---will not <br/>\ntake you further on the journey.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Relatively speaking (! &lt;g&gt;) this is the gentlest place to figure this <br/>\nout. But if you think understanding unschooling is hard, try explaining <br/>\nit to family, friends, and strangers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is NOT a journey for wimps! You really DO have to be strong to <br/>\nstand up for your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If they run away because they can&#39;t handle *my* heat &lt;g&gt;, they <br/>\nprobably couldn&#39;t stand up to a Mil&#39;s or a neighbor&#39;s heat---or even <br/>\ntheir own selves!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Not that that&#39;s my goal (to chase them away), but this is NOT easy!

If you&#39;re fighting every step of the way, I&#39;ll let <br/>\nyou stop---and even run back to where it&#39;s safe. I can&#39;t stop you! <br/>\n*Many* people can&#39;t or won&#39;t make this trip.

I can&#39;t <br/>\nmake you follow me. I *can* make this path seem attractive enough for <br/>\nyou, smoother, and with fewer rocks. I can show you ways to lighten <br/>\nyour load. I can help toss shit aside. I can give you some tips on how <br/>\nto breathe better or work your legs a bit to build up muscles you never <br/>\nknew you had.

You have to *want* to <br/>\ngo there! You have to *want* to make the change. I&#39;m not going to pull <br/>\nyou along or even carry you. YOU have to take the steps.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess I could stop and sit down with you and hold your hand and <br/>\ncommiserate with how hard the journey is, but that won&#39;t get you *any* <br/>\nfurther along. It slows you down. And if I commiserate long <br/>\nenough---you may simply decide that the journey&#39;s been long enough and <br/>\nput a leaky tent up right where you are. There&#39;s a beautiful, sparkling <br/>\nunschooling city *just* around the corner. But I can&#39;t make you go <br/>\nthere. It&#39;s up to *YOU*.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  It sounds like so many of you are wonderful parents but shouldn&#39;t that <br/>\nextend into being a<br/>\n  supportive human being---expecially on a list called unschooling <br/>\nbasics???<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Really, Leslie, if you&#39;re not getting the help you&#39;re looking for <br/>\nhere, you don&#39;t have to stay.

It&#39;s a lot easier to sit on the sidewalks and <br/>\nwatch others get pushed beyond what they ever felt possible while <br/>\ncriticizing the coaches than it is to show up every day and help people <br/>\non the journey---but hey---whatever floats your boat.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Can&#39;t people be helped without being judged or ridiculed?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sure.

You don&#39;t have to be<br/>\naround here long enough to see that the seasoned unschoolers *tell it like<br/>\nit is* and won&#39;t support anything that is the *old* way of thinking.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCall it tough love or whatever... if you are coming here asking for help you<br/>\nwill always get it!  But if you are coming here for answers and get them and<br/>\nthen go on about how those answers are wrong (of implying that what we do is<br/>\nun-parenting!) or won&#39;t work then be prepared for a ruckus.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis is all IMO, of course.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nLesa\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net\">http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net</a>\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stoptherod.net/\">http://stoptherod.net/</a>\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://parentinginjesusfootsteps.org/\">http://parentinginjesusfootsteps.org/</a>\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n&quot;Conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.&quot; \r<br/>\n     -John F.

I was actually going to bring up &quot;unparenting&quot; ..YUCKY <br/>\n <br/>\nThe problem is perception.  One parents safe zone can be another&#39;s  panic <br/>\nzone.<br/>\n <br/>\nI see a trend in the unparenting statement. Honestly, hearing it a few  times <br/>\nthe last week I&#39;m seeing it as a negative insulting statement(thankfully  not <br/>\ndirected at me bc my bs meter has reached it&#39;s limit) .  Less  judging and <br/>\nmore understanding of the real crisis IF ANY. Neglect  happens, yes. However.. <br/>\nmore often I see parental panic/worry or even  micro-managing of small people. <br/>\nFamily values that cross into rules followed by  sadness and tears... Nothing <br/>\nto do with unschooling...<br/>\n <br/>\nIn school kids do for parents,teachers,friends or their future and less for  <br/>\nthemselves. In unschooling they answer to themselves and or their parents(not  <br/>\nadults but great practice).

She&#39;s on a break - she just finished doing a  <br/>\nvery intense musical theater production at the community college, in  <br/>\nwhich she had her first really big lead part - it was exhausting. She  <br/>\nalso was just in her first big dance concert - she took up dancing  <br/>\nlate - at 16 years old - and it is hard for her. She has her first- <br/>\never boyfriend - so there is a lot of stress (good stress/happy  <br/>\nstress) associated with that, for her - lots of self-consciousness,  <br/>\nespecially.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah - and there is the fact that we had a fire in our house,  <br/>\nwe&#39;re living in a rental without almost any of our own belongings -  <br/>\nthe rest of us got clothing out, but she got almost none of her  <br/>\nclothing - none of her music, and on and on. (It isn&#39;t burned up, it  <br/>\nis mostly being cleaned and stored - but it has been 3 months and she  <br/>\nreally misses her stuff more than the rest of us do.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking two full days to do NOTHING but play &quot;The SIMS&quot; seems like a  <br/>\nreally nice kind of down time to me. So - she did that for two days  <br/>\nand then yesterday evening she came to our homeschool park day with  <br/>\nmy husband, just to hang around with other people for an hour or two,  <br/>\nand then later last night about 11 pm she suddenly called a  <br/>\ngirlfriend and made arrangements to go there and spend the night and  <br/>\nsome other kids are going too and she seemed all refreshed and happy  <br/>\nand ready to party! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOther times that my kids have played videogames for hour after hour -  <br/>\nday after day - have not always been so obviously &quot;recovery time.&quot;  <br/>\nSometimes it is because they have a new game and they LOVE it and are  <br/>\nchallenged to master it and just don&#39;t want to stop until they have  <br/>\nhad enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know lots of kids who play videogames at night - most of the night.  <br/>\nThese are games in which they interact with other players, online,  <br/>\nand they go on all night, partly because of time zone differences. It  <br/>\nis exciting, fun, there is a LOT of learning going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosie just completed an online driver education course - worked on it  <br/>\nabout 6 hours per day, for about 6 days. A few months ago she was  <br/>\ndoing an online math course (ALEKS) the same way - spending 6 to 8  <br/>\nhours per day on it. That&#39;s how some people function - it is how &quot;I&quot;  <br/>\nfunction, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see any difference between playing videogames and doing the  <br/>\nmath or drivers ed online programs, in terms of &quot;educational value.&quot;  <br/>\nSome people would be impressed and think it was wonderful that she  <br/>\nworked so hard on the online &quot;courses&quot; and would be distressed by  <br/>\nspending that same amount of time playing online games. To separate  <br/>\nwhat is educational from what is not - that seems incredibly arrogant  <br/>\nto me. I know, from years of watching many many kids, that we cannot  <br/>\nsee, from the outside, what is happening inside their heads - we  <br/>\ncan&#39;t know what brain development is taking place, we can&#39;t know what  <br/>\nthey are really learning, and it is ridiculous for us to think we  <br/>\nknow better than they do which activity is more valuable for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":270732084,"authorName":"Gail Jones","from":"Gail Jones &lt;discovering_joy@...&gt;","profile":"discovering_joy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Hating homeschooling & unparenting","postDate":"1149183032","msgId":13860,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNjAxMTczMDMyLjY3NTYzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQyMTAzLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDODUzQjJEN0RCMDFCMy0yN0MtMTFCQUBNQkxLLU0yMy5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":13844,"nextInTopic":13863,"prevInTime":13859,"nextInTime":13861,"topicId":13843,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"kelly - just remember when letters come like this these are just people s fears and worries coming up all brought on by what we have been indoctrinated all our","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-107422069\">kelly - just remember when letters come like this these are just people&#39;s fears and worries coming up all brought on by what we have been indoctrinated all our lives by the public school system etc....

Children<br/>\n are not tiny adults, and should not be treated as such. It does<br/>\n them a disservice to do so. I would not let my daughter spend 12<br/>\n hours a day in front of a video game any more than I&#39;d let her eat<br/>\n an entire box of cookies each night for dinner, or not bathe or<br/>\n brush her teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ren let this post by *just* as we were all heading out of town to the <br/>\nNE Unschooling conference in Peabody. I believe Tresa&#39;s already left <br/>\nthe list---not unexpectedly IMO after she sent *this* post! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ll still respond since others of you may be sitting on the same <br/>\nfence.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Children are NOT tiny adults, you&#39;re right. They&#39;re more akin to <br/>\nforeigners in a strange land. BUT they *are* just as deserving of <br/>\nrespect and *should* be treated as *such*!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I &quot;let&quot; my children play video games 12 hours/day. They&#39;re welcome to <br/>\neat an entire box of cookies for dinner. They must not bathe or brush <br/>\ntheir teeth on my schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But one doesn&#39;t play video games at all. The other plays when he wants <br/>\nto---but he&#39;ll just as soon jump in the pool, jump on the trampoline, <br/>\ngo for a walk, have me read to him, bake brownies or make spaghetti, as <br/>\nplay video games---unless it&#39;s brand new! Then he chooses to play with <br/>\nit for some time. Neither has ever eaten a box of cookies for dinner. <br/>\nNot even close! I, on the other hand, had more food regulations and <br/>\nhave been known to eat a box of cookies! &lt;g&gt; Both bathe and brush their <br/>\nteeth regularly---sometimes with reminders.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is my job as a parent to make sure my children are healthy and <br/>\nhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  By that, you mean that I don&#39;t make sure my children are healthy and <br/>\nhappy?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\n Although some kids might think an all day video-game, cookie<br/>\n eating, bath-free world would be fabulous,<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=--=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ummmm---probably just the kids from whom these things are withheld or <br/>\nenforced. Children with free choice choose other activities, broccoli, <br/>\nand baths.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n as a parent we know that<br/>\n would lead to illness in the short term, obesity in the long term.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Liar.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And as soon as your kids realize this, everything you say will be <br/>\nquestioned.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Obviously that&#39;s an extreme example, but it makes the point.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  No, it doesn&#39;t. You&#39;re showing a lack of trust in your kids and really <br/>\njust relying on old tapes in your head.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If people are coming to this list, we assume they are looking to make <br/>\nchanges in their lives. Clinging to old thoughts and ideas is no way to <br/>\nget unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Children need parents for a reason, and sometimes, that reason is to<br/>\n tell them &quot;no&quot; untill they are mature enough to make healthy,<br/>\n reasonable, responsible decisions themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  They need parents to love them and trust them and help them make their <br/>\nway. They don&#39;t need a dictator who will them them where and when and <br/>\nhow. They come into this world as capable learners. VERY capable <br/>\nlearners. What they need is someone who will help them make healthy, <br/>\nreasonable, responsible decisions NOW---not when they are &quot;mature&quot; <br/>\nenough---NOW! ANd they can and they do.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean un-parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  If I had a dollar for every damned time I heard that, I&#39;d be on my <br/>\nlittle farm in Virginia right now!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling parents should be THE MOST attentive parents in the world! <br/>\nWe should make every effort to be present WITH our children and know <br/>\nwhat they need and try to make that happen. Unschooling parents should <br/>\nbe helping their children to manuever through rough terrain, not <br/>\nblocking the way or making it rougher. They should be letting them know <br/>\nwhat&#39;s acceptable and expected on different road types---especially new <br/>\nones. We can offer maps and directions when they ask or quietly stuff <br/>\none in a pocket---just in case. We should hold their hands when it&#39;s <br/>\nrocky or slippery and stand close by when it&#39;s smooth and familiar. <br/>\nThey NEED to feel their way and even get lost every now and then (a <br/>\ngreat way to learn a new city, by the way!), but they don&#39;t need a <br/>\nback-seat driver or to be tugged this way and that down the street!<br/>\n<br/>\n Be the partner they need!<br/>\n<br/>\n Unparenting---BAH!<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n Conference Coordinator<br/>\n Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting.
