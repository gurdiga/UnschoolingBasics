For me it shows a wonderful way of<br/>\n&#39;unschooling&#39; on a different level. And I see my child as a kind of Baxter,<br/>\neager to learn and excited to be alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun<br/>\n<br/>\nUlrike<br/>\nfrom Namibia - somewhere in Africa<br/>\nPS Alexander made contact with a little boy in the UK yesterday. They have<br/>\nsuch a lot of fun exchanging posts and telling each other jokes and asking<br/>\nabout the respective living conditions. The best unschooled environment I<br/>\ncan imagine.

She met my<br/>\n&gt; rather high price and even though I had disaster images in my mind, I<br/>\n&gt; accepted her offer.  THen, over the next couple of hours I had 2 other<br/>\n&gt; clients cancel, leaving me mostly free this week to work with him but more<br/>\n&gt; than doubling my expected income.  I Love it when things work out that<br/>\nway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The next day when I went to pick up Baxter I was embroiled in the rescue<br/>\n&gt; groups politics, inundated with doom and gloom information about his past<br/>\n&gt; behaviors and gave serious consideration to baking out of the deal.  But,<br/>\n&gt; then I met him and his grin let me know that it was going to be ok.  He is<br/>\n&gt; seriously cute and can bend his tail in three spots, the third bend occurs<br/>\n&gt; when he&#39;s figuring something out or otherwise concentrating with all of<br/>\nhis<br/>\n&gt; might.  He&#39;s a border collie/pointer/hound mix as far as I can tell in<br/>\ncase<br/>\n&gt; you want a visual image of him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cordy gave his token growl when we got to the front door and Baxter<br/>\n&gt; completely ignored him, walked past him, out the back door and found a<br/>\nball<br/>\n&gt; to toss to himself and taunt Cordy with.  As I watched them frolic<br/>\ntogether<br/>\n&gt; I decided to blank out everything I&#39;d been told about him and just let him<br/>\n&gt; tell me about himself.  Cordy gave me a very rare lick on the cheek as<br/>\nsoon<br/>\n&gt; as I decided to do this so I knew that I was on the right track.  Knowing<br/>\n&gt; the environment where he&#39;d just come from I decided to just let him be for<br/>\n&gt; the day, got a book and we all stayed out in the backyard together until<br/>\n&gt; night fall.  He is way too skinny so I fed him until he decided to stop,<br/>\n&gt; which was after 3 large bowls of the dog food that I cook for Cordy.  An<br/>\n&gt; impressive amount.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When we came inside for the night he hopped on top of the kitchen table,<br/>\n&gt; purely out of curiosity as far as I could tell.  I explained that dogs<br/>\n&gt; generally don&#39;t climb up on food surfaces and he happily hopped off and<br/>\n&gt; hasn&#39;t gotten on it again.  IN fact he has learned everything from basic<br/>\n&gt; manners to how to use a dog door, ride in the car, watch a little league<br/>\n&gt; game, etc in one or two repetitions.  He is as smart as Cordy and that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; saying quite a lot especially since he&#39;s been living in a field with 50<br/>\n&gt; other dogs for the last 18 months of his 2 years on the planet with very<br/>\n&gt; limited human interaction and no socialization of any kind.  In the past<br/>\n72<br/>\n&gt; hours he has learned what takes most dogs many months to learn and is<br/>\n&gt; clearly eager for more.  He could teach cats about curiosity and I&#39;m sure<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s what has gotten him in trouble in the past but if you just let him<br/>\n&gt; figure out whatever has his attention he&#39;s satisfied and checks it off his<br/>\n&gt; list.  I&#39;m finding him to be wonderfully facinating and a whole lot of fun<br/>\n&gt; to teach and be around, Cordy agrees and I know this because for the first<br/>\n&gt; time ever he moved over to let Baxter share his bed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Because he has settled in here so easily I have spoken to him every day<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; every night about how this is just a temporary arrangement.  That on<br/>\n&gt; Thursday he will either go back to the rescue ranch or into a foster home.<br/>\n&gt; Each time he has laid a paw on my cheek, wagged his tail and then licks my<br/>\n&gt; nose.  I felt that I wasn&#39;t really getting through to him so I decided to<br/>\n&gt; get quiet and speak with him telepathically just to make sure that he<br/>\nreally<br/>\n&gt; understood what was going on.  I did my thing and he about shot out of his<br/>\n&gt; skin when he obviously heard me talking with him.  It took some time to<br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt; him to stop licking me and pouncing on me in glee but once he had calmed<br/>\n&gt; down I explained it again in great detail.  Once again, he put one paw on<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; cheek, wagged his tail and then licked the end of my nose, but this time I<br/>\n&gt; heard him say, &quot;It&#39;s ALL Good.  I&#39;m here now, aren&#39;t I and I&#39;m having a<br/>\n&gt; wonderful time.  That&#39;s the important part, what&#39;s happening right now,<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; happens next will happen next but there&#39;s no use worrying about it now, is<br/>\n&gt; there?  I always have a wonderful time wherever I am, so don&#39;t worry about<br/>\n&gt; me.  I love learning new things and I&#39;ve learned more new things in the<br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; that I&#39;ve known you than I have in a long time, so I&#39;m happy and now I<br/>\nknow<br/>\n&gt; them for forever so what could be better?  The journey is the fun part.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; And then he went to sleep.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BUt I&#39;ve been thinking about what he said a lot this evening and it&#39;s so<br/>\n&gt; very, very true.  So often in relationships with everything from money to<br/>\n&gt; marriages we worry about the future and fearing that the good times will<br/>\nend<br/>\n&gt; at some point, but that&#39;s really not the point of the excercise.  The<br/>\npoint<br/>\n&gt; is to enjoy your happiness in THIS moment and allow the future to take<br/>\ncare<br/>\n&gt; of itself, and if you&#39;re happy now, then you&#39;ll be even happier later<br/>\n&gt; because of LOA. (Law of Attraction)  CJ (Chief Joseph) had said that the<br/>\npoint Is the journey when I talked<br/>\n&gt; with him and  I loved that line so much that I&#39;ve put it on my business<br/>\n&gt; t-shirts but I didn&#39;t really get it until I heard Baxter say it.  10 years<br/>\n&gt; studying this stuff and the most poignant words come from a rangy mutt who<br/>\n&gt; stops off for a week.  I LOVE my life!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wags- Juls, Cordy and Baxter the sages in disguise<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Live Abraham Chat anytime or especially at 9-10PM EST.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; See:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abraham-hicks.net\">http://abraham-hicks.net</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; and scroll to the bottom of the page.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
