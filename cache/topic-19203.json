My name is Angie, and we grew/transitioned quite<br/>\nnaturally toward whole-life unschooling from the foundations of<br/>\nAttachment Parenting.  My two daughters, Prairie (3.75yo) and Karina<br/>\n(22mo), both nurse and co-sleep, and live and learn naturally in South<br/>\nDakota, with me as partner/playmate/facilitator/cook/bath tub<br/>\nfiller-upper/and not-so-successful-housekeeper.  As a sidenote to &quot;the<br/>\nfacts&quot; of my intro, I am wondering if my growing &quot;dependence&quot; on these<br/>\ngreat lists is heading toward &quot;addiction&quot; LOL!  &lt;kidding&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to Pat for the Heads-Up on AlwaysUnschooled, to all of you<br/>\ndedicated unschoolers who make time to keep lists running smoothly,<br/>\nand to all the newbies who bring up an enormity of great discussion<br/>\npoints that keep us all growing toward respectful family dynamics.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAngie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19197,"nextTopicId":19208}}
