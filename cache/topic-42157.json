I never say anything, but sometimes they come back.  Today my &quot;teen&quot; (such a derogatory word to me...I like young man better! Teenager is always said with such animosity, anyone else notice that?) son told me he was watching some animae.  He has really gotten into quite a few different ones like Bleach, and the one he is now watching which I can&#39;t remember the name.  Anyway I asked how he liked it and he said he PREFERS the Japanese versions with subtitles.  He is learning Japanese this way!  He got himself a Japanese dictionary and with the listening and reading he is starting to use the language in his everyday life.  He is now thinking of saving up to take a tour trip to Japan!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had been my mother, or continued to play those tapes, I would have been thwarting his efforts on many levels.  It would start with completely unrelated things like cleaning his room....move on to his &quot;anti-social&quot; behavior (it isn&#39;t really, he just is a young man who needs his space and likes to be able to retreat to his room to work on things...but if I was my mom that would be anti-social and bordering a need for counseling...)....then it would focus on the non-christian aspect of the programs he is watching and how &quot;evil&quot; they are...and finally how he is wasting his time and his brain watching these &quot;mindless&quot; cartoons with ridiculous facial expressions and overacting.  Thank the universe I am NOT my mother and I instead encourage him to explore these things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould I have been as encouraging last year before I really got into unschooling everything in our lives?  Probably not as much....I probably would have nodded, smiling, and moved on.  I see how excited he gets, how happy, how he loves the language and I can&#39;t help but send this post thanking all of you for your support and letting you know that &quot;teens&quot; are <br/>\n&quot;able&quot; to choose things that work for them, make them happy and are learning cool things to boot!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy Thanksgiving gratitude is for the many men and women who make up this list encouraging us to look at things differently, give us a little tough love, make us look at the universe in a new way and encourage us as we give our children wings to fly.
