I am having trouble<br/>\n&gt; potty training my 3 1/2 yr old son. We&#39;ve been working on it off and<br/>\n&gt; on since he turned three (and some before then, but he wasn&#39;t ever<br/>\n&gt; dry through the night untill then and so we didn&#39;t push it too much<br/>\n&gt; and we also moved cross country in February and had read that you<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t try when there is a big life change like that). We read<br/>\n&gt; all the books (picture books about potty training like &quot;Once Upon A <br/>\n&gt; Potty etc), I have two Video&#39;s about Potty Training that he likes to <br/>\n&gt; watch (was hoping Elmo would get him excited enough to learn! Since <br/>\n&gt; Elmo is his favorite! No dice!)I put him in cloth training pants <br/>\n&gt; every few days to &#39;try again&#39; but he and I both end up frustrated <br/>\n&gt; when he ends up wetting/messing his pants and just go back to <br/>\n&gt; diapers or pull-ups. Have read a bit about letting him go about w/ <br/>\n&gt; no pants on at all, but it&#39;s pretty cold and don&#39;t know if he&#39;d get <br/>\n&gt; too cold? Not sure what to do. His sister is about to turn two the <br/>\n&gt; end of this month(and is just getting verbal enough to start <br/>\n&gt; thinking of training perhaps) and I am thinking perhaps I&#39;ll try and <br/>\n&gt; train them at the same time so maybe he&#39;ll be more interested in it <br/>\n&gt; if it&#39;s a group activity...?

My son wasn&#39;t interested at that age either.  We tried to insist<br/>\nand he ended up proving to us that he was in control by not pooping at all &<br/>\nended up constipated.  A very painful situation for all of us.  So we put<br/>\nthe diapers back on.  And waited.  He was in a mothers day out program a<br/>\ncouple mornings a week at the time and over Christmas break, they told me he<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t come back unless he was potty trained.  He was 4 yrs old by then.<br/>\nSo I told him that.  And it was his choice, whether he wanted to continue at<br/>\nthe MDO program.  He basically potty-trained himself over the holiday break.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger daughter trained herself about the time she was 3.  She surprised<br/>\nus!

I am having trouble<br/>\n&gt; potty training my 3 1/2 yr old son. We&#39;ve been working on it off and<br/>\n&gt; on since he turned three (and some before then, but he wasn&#39;t ever<br/>\n&gt; dry through the night untill then and so we didn&#39;t push it too much<br/>\n&gt; and we also moved cross country in February and had read that you<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t try when there is a big life change like that). We read<br/>\n&gt; all the books (picture books about potty training like &quot;Once Upon A<br/>\n&gt; Potty etc), I have two Video&#39;s about Potty Training that he likes to<br/>\n&gt; watch (was hoping Elmo would get him excited enough to learn!

His sister is about to turn two the<br/>\n&gt; end of this month(and is just getting verbal enough to start<br/>\n&gt; thinking of training perhaps) and I am thinking perhaps I&#39;ll try and<br/>\n&gt; train them at the same time so maybe he&#39;ll be more interested in it<br/>\n&gt; if it&#39;s a group activity...? I am frustrated and feeling like a bit<br/>\n&gt; of a failure. Like, if I can&#39;t even teach him to use the toilet, how<br/>\n&gt; will I EVER teach him to read, write, etc etc etc... He&#39;s a bright<br/>\n&gt; little boy in other areas and he likes to sit on the toilet, but<br/>\n&gt; just to &#39;pretend&#39; and practice &#39;wiping&#39;(he&#39;s observed his Dad and I<br/>\n&gt; going to the bathroom as we&#39;ve read that is a good idea for him to<br/>\n&gt; see so he knows &#39;what to do&#39;)...
