I am lucky to have a job <br/>\nthat I can do from home.  It is w/the company I was with before <br/>\nchildren (medical billing and reporting).  The wonderous computer and <br/>\ninternet has made this possible.  Working from home has many benfits, <br/>\nbut, also can be quite difficult.  I am here and when the kids need <br/>\nme I have to put aside what I am doing.  I have a mom&#39;s helper that <br/>\ncomes.  However, we are in a period now where the kids are not <br/>\nwanting a sitter so we are taking a break.  I work in the early <br/>\nmorning, at night, and a few hours on weekends.  My dh takes over <br/>\nwhen he gets home on the nights that I work.  I only work 15 to 20 <br/>\nhours a week and my employer is very flexible and accomodating.  If <br/>\nthey werent I couldnt do it.  My family comes first.  What I have <br/>\nlearned is to listen to my kids.  I don&#39;t ever wanting them to think <br/>\nthat my job is more important than them.  However, my dd is 6 and I <br/>\ndo try to help her understand that my job is extra money and that <br/>\nhelps to pay for her horsebackriding lessons and other extras that we <br/>\nenjoy.  My ds is 4 and is not able to make the connection.  It has <br/>\nbeen a challenge and I know it has gotten easier since they were even <br/>\nsmaller.  I just take each day and try not to let the job take over  <br/>\nand dimminish my enjoyment of the kids.  Although at times it can be <br/>\nstressful, especially when I have something that needs to get done <br/>\nand my office is in my home.  I have also given myself a break w/the <br/>\nhouse.  I will never have the perfect tidy house w/everything in order<br/>\n(that&#39;s my personality and I have relaxed quite a bit thanks to <br/>\nunschooling).  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren in MA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Andrea&quot; &lt;andrealynn@v...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi, my name is Andrea and I&#39;ve been lurking for a while.
