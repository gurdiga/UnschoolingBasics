There&#39;s a difference. I <br/>\nexpect to be treated decently, from adults and children. <br/>\nChildren don&#39;t have the same skill level, but if Jalen is screeching <br/>\nat me and being generally loud and demanding, I might say &quot;hey, if <br/>\nyou just ask me in a soft voice, I can help you better&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGentle nudges, gentle nudges.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I clean Sierra&#39;s room, I DO ask her to help...if she&#39;s busy <br/>\nthat&#39;s fine, but I&#39;m not just running around all day cleaning up and <br/>\nnever asking for assistance.  I also let them know when I&#39;m <br/>\nexhausted and what will help me have a better day or night.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s different when they&#39;re little, they love to help but most of <br/>\ntheir help only makes tasks take longer for you....that&#39;s part of <br/>\nsetting up a partnership between you and your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you noticed your 4y.o. loving to be in the middle of household <br/>\ntasks, wanting to try everything and &quot;help&quot;?<br/>\nThat&#39;s the sweet involvement we&#39;re perpetuating. Each child, that is <br/>\nbeing honored for the different ways they help, continue to see <br/>\nthemselves as a valuable part of a family unit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe families where the mother plays martyr, usually have control <br/>\nissues too. The ones I&#39;ve known, the mother doesn&#39;t WANT outside <br/>\nhelp, she&#39;ll stop them from doing it because she wants it done a <br/>\ncertain way, but she&#39;ll moan about all the hard work she does. Yuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you appreciate whatever form of help they give, show them new <br/>\nskills as they get older and make a partnership of these tasks, <br/>\nyou&#39;ll get a whole different result. It takes a lot of letting go to <br/>\nget there....<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8228,"nextTopicId":8114}}
