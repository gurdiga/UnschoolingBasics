I was only really just getting into unschooling when we<br/>\nwent, AND since my kids were 3 & 4 at the time, I wasn&#39;t really looking at<br/>\ncurriculum.  I second the statement that Barb Lundgren is a die-hard<br/>\nunschooler (this year they will be showing a preview of the movie &quot;Schooled&quot;<br/>\n- previews look good).  I also remember feeling very uncomfortable at how<br/>\nfree the kids were allowed to be.  I felt like I was free-falling sometimes<br/>\n(those kids should be sitting down or just leave -- wait, wait, breathe,<br/>\nit&#39;s OK.)  Yes, there were &quot;experts&quot; and it definitely was a &quot;conference&quot; --<br/>\nat least for me, as I went to as many meetings as I could.  But for me,<br/>\nthose meetings did more for me for unschooling and RU (though I didn&#39;t know<br/>\nit at the time) than most other things I&#39;ve read since (haven&#39;t been able to<br/>\ngo anywhere else, sadly).<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year I worked in the Kids&#39; Village at RE.  The area for them was huge,<br/>\nI think it took up three of the hotel&#39;s conferene areas (movable dividers).<br/>\nThe workers there appeared to be much less dominating and directive than<br/>\nother child care-givers I&#39;ve used.  The tone also appeared to be that you<br/>\ncould bring in your kid IF you wanted to.  There were a number of children<br/>\nin some of the meetings, but there were also a number of things for kids to<br/>\ndo (up through teens) IF they wanted to.  I think there was a perpetual<br/>\ngroup of teens just hanging out in one area in the atrium(?).  The kids were<br/>\n(to me at the time) essentially allowed to go where they wanted to and do<br/>\nwhat they wanted to.  but there was stuff scheduled for them if they were<br/>\ninterested.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the biggest relief to me was the large amount of DADS that<br/>\nattended.  I was really quite worried about attending this huge<br/>\nestrogen-fest.  We had a Dad&#39;s Meeting on Sat. night which was also really<br/>\nhelpful for me.  I&#39;m hoping there&#39;ll be even more dads there this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Rob Saxon<br/>\nDH to Seana for 10 years<br/>\n&quot;Daddy!&quot; to Genevieve (5.5) and Elissa (4+)<br/>\n<br/>\n--Rob <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] L&L vs RE","postDate":"1184378011","msgId":24967,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyNjk0OS45MTIzMC5xbUB3ZWI1MzgwMy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGY3OHE2YSsxZjA5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24966,"nextInTopic":24971,"prevInTime":24966,"nextInTime":24970,"topicId":24960,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Rethinking Education was different but still cool?

RE wasn&#39;t really an unschooling conference.  That year it was a 3-day affair (Fri-Sun) with Friday being almost completely presentations by curriculum reps.  The vendor area was filled with curriculum dealers all weekend.  There were a couple of non-curriculum tables, but not with the completely unschooling feel of L&L.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  There was a box-town kinda play area for little kids and some other kid stuff, but since I&#39;d gone alone -- the kids were with dh and my sister&#39;s family while I went conferencing -- I don&#39;t really know much about that part of it.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Overall, I like L&L much better. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nShape Yahoo! in your own image.
