The word modeling connotates<br/>\nmolding or shaping. I don&#39;t model cleaning joyously in my home. I clean<br/>\njoyously as a way to live my life with joy. I don&#39;t clean with the intention<br/>\nthat my children will pick up the same attitudes and behaviors. I want them<br/>\nto have the freedom to be authentic. I live the way I choose because it<br/>\nfeels better to clean with joy. I am not actively trying to get a result (ie<br/>\nthem loving cleaning).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same with teaching. To teach something is to assume that one person<br/>\nknows and another person doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39348,"nextTopicId":39434}}
