Well let me say, if you ask my son, he would have school no other way!  Now granted, people tell me, &quot;Of course, unschooling works for you.  Your son is gifted!&quot;  Personally, I think that&#39;s a load of balderdash.  My son (and daughter who&#39;s in ps hs) love to learn.  It never got crushed out of them.  Both my kids, research their interests<br/>\n  and read all they can.  One took the private to public school path.  The other. those options, didn&#39;t work for.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  If your spouse has concerns, have him talk to your child about what the child is doing.  My son will tell you he hates math as he hangs upside down and does algebra in his head for fun.  (Just don&#39;t tell him it&#39;s math, lol.)  My son by age, is third grade.  The evaluator told me to skip up a few grades so he doesn&#39;t get bored.  Just to stock the shelves, I bought fifth grade books and the flash cards.  Turns out my son already knew most of them just from watching animal planet and such.  Children will learn if you make available things that intrigue their minds.   Think about what you enjoyed learning and how it made you want to learn more.  That&#39;s how children are.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Lol, my 16yo just said to her 9yo brother,&quot; Don&#39;t make me use my imagination on you.&quot;<br/>\n  It&#39;s so funny because that&#39;s all she had to say to get him to giggle and leave her alone.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  There&#39;s no one and only path to learning.  Why fill it with tears, fights, and boring stuff?<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNo need to miss a message. Get email on-the-go <br/>\nwith Yahoo!
