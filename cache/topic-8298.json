I think you broke down unschooling in a marvelous way. I have been homeschooling for many years now and spoke to several people last year about unschooling but I just couldn&#39;t understand how they would do math or Grammar/Language. We kind of done school similiar to unschooling last year. I guess we formally homeschooled for about 4 months last year using S.O.S and it was too tedious for the boys so we unschooled for the remainder of the year. I was scared because I kept wondering what can they possibly be learning. Both boys want to hunt, fish, ride 4 wheelers, drive the jeep in the pasture, & talk on the phone. They do not like video games or t.v. very much. The youngest likes working on things that has wheels...because he likes to drive. Oh, they both have full time jobs also. They work with a friend of our in a scrap yard doing odds and ends. Everyone around here knows they homeschool so if little odd jobs need to be<br/>\n done they call on the boys. After they have worked a long, hot or cold day they want to come home and do their own thing, not schoolwork. Thanks to both of you for the wonderful sites. I&#39;ll be reading, searching & looking for ways to have a fun unschooling time. Is anyone in the group close to the North Alabama area, including the tri-states?<br/>\n  Blessings, Cynthia<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nGet your email and more, right on the  new Yahoo.com <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":248268539,"authorName":"Elissa Jill Cleaveland","from":"&quot;Elissa Jill Cleaveland&quot; &lt;MystikMomma@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] unschooling question","postDate":"1157466907","msgId":17108,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTgwMWM2ZDBmOCQ3Yzc1ZjU5MCQwMWZlYThjMEBzcXVpZD4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwOTA0MTYwNDE5LjUyMDY2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjU4MzAzLm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":17100,"nextInTopic":17119,"prevInTime":17107,"nextInTime":17109,"topicId":8298,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here s your lesson plan to start.

I have heard that unschooling is where you just let <br/>\nthem learn what they want to learn, is this correct?<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\nYou might want to do some side reading along with this list. Most of these books are in your library:<br/>\nFrank Smith&#39;s _The Book of Learning and Forgetting_<br/>\nJohn Taylor Gatto&#39;s _Dumbing Us Down_ and _The Underground History of American Education_<br/>\nDaniel Pink&#39;s _Free Agent Nation_<br/>\nGrace Llewellyn&#39;s _The Teenage Liberation Handbook_<br/>\nMary Griffith&#39;s _The Unschooling Handbook_<br/>\nAll books by John Holt, the father of unschooling (I suggest reading them all, in order, so you can watch<br/>\nhim leave school reform and start touting unschooling. Others say just _Learning All the Time_)<br/>\n <br/>\nThese books are new and probably NOT in your library---all are available from the authors---just google:<br/>\nValerie Fitzenreiter&#39;s _The Unprocessed Child_ Sandra Dodd&#39;s _Moving a Puddle and Other Essays_ And my favorite, Rue Kream&#39;s _Parenting a Free Child, an Unschooled Life_  There are two magazines: _Life Learning_ and _Live Free Learn Free_ both devoted to unschooling.  Websites: www.SandraDodd.com   www.borntoexplore.com     Joyce&#39;s (Sorry---I don&#39;t know that one by heart---help?!)-=-=-=-<br/>\n If so how do you get 2 teen boys to learn when they are not going to choose to learn anything unless they <br/>\nare made.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nYou first change your thinking! Teenage boys naturally LOVE to learn. Unfortunately, Bob Jones and ABeka <br/>\ncan turn even the most avid learner against learning ANYTHING! They need time to heal--to deschool or <br/>\ndeprogram from all that drivel. What are their passions?<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n How do you teach them math or english?<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\nBy living a life full of both. You &quot;teach&quot; by example---by modelling the behavior you&#39;d like to see. Are <br/>\nYOU interested in math and english? Do you get into fractions and percentages? Do you talk about adverbs <br/>\nand noun clauses. Not unless you need/want to is my guess. They&#39;re no different.<br/>\n <br/>\nMostly I think they already KNOW english! They probably already know most of the math they&#39;ll ever need. <br/>\n <br/>\nDo you think they need to know *everything* before they&#39;re 18? Did *you*?<br/>\n <br/>\nThey have their whole lives ahead of them! Real learners never stop learning! Unless forced to learn---<br/>\nTHAT&#39;s a real turn-off! <br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n They ask me all the time why do <br/>\nthey have to learn the things that Switched on Schoolhouse is trying to teach <br/>\nthem when they don&#39;t see they are ever going to use it in life, especially the <br/>\nHistory lessons. <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nSmart boys!<br/>\n <br/>\nYou may find that they already have a passion for a certain time in history (my 17 year old is really <br/>\ninto the &#39;60s and 70&#39;s right now (wow---my life as history! &lt;g&gt;), it just may not be Elizabethan England <br/>\nor The Russian Revolution. History&#39;s a BIG subject. They&#39;ll find parts of it when they&#39;re ready. History <br/>\nof art or weapons or cultures or war or fashion or architecture---it&#39;s ALL related, really!<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling IS about letting them learn what they want to learn. But it&#39;s MUCH more than that. It&#39;s also <br/>\nabout respecting them and their choices and trusting that they are learning creatures who are naturally <br/>\ncurious about their world. It&#39;s about not forcing them to learn what isn&#39;t interesting to them *now*. It&#39;s <br/>\nabout believeing that they *will* learn in time all they&#39;ll need to know.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s harder than it sounds! &lt;G&gt; Because, as parents, it means challenging ourselves every day to trust, <br/>\nrespect, and believe in our children to a higher degree than other parents. It&#39;s so simple when you <br/>\nfinally understand it, but it takes a while to get there! You NEED to trust them---and that&#39;s not something <br/>\nour culture/society likes! It&#39;s going against the mainstream. Unschooling&#39;s not for every parent. Every <br/>\nCHILD can THRIVE---but it&#39;s a hurdle for most parents!<br/>\n <br/>\nAny other questions? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":30983993,"authorName":"Lesa McMahon-Lowe","from":"&quot;Lesa McMahon-Lowe&quot; &lt;lesajm@...&gt;","profile":"lesamlowe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] unschooling question","postDate":"1134736705","msgId":8399,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTExNS1EQVY1OTZDNDY0QkI4NzlDNUM1NDAzRjVEMzNBMEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","referencesHeader":"PDcyMzkyQTQyLUYyMEItNDU4NC04NUYyLUJFNEQ3QThEMTAwRUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":8320,"nextInTopic":8401,"prevInTime":8398,"nextInTime":8400,"topicId":8298,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Did anyone mention the Teenagers Liberation Handbook to Cynthia?

And you get better at  <br/>\nthem, again, as a side effect of using them.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one needs to learn to be a gourmet cook in order to start cooking.  <br/>\nYou just start and make mistakes and learn what you need as you need  <br/>\nit. Same with everything. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do boys (usually! ;-) learn to work on cars? By messing around  <br/>\nwith them. By reading about them. By talking to other people about  <br/>\nthem. No one needs to make them learn. They keep pulling themself  <br/>\nalong through new territory because it&#39;s interesting.

You <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to memorize a bunch of stuff that doesn&#39;t apply to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure others will respond to this much better than I did.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Alyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: unschooling question","postDate":"1134495275","msgId":8301,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRubjBuYittZnE2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjEzMTYwMDEyLjg5MzUwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUwOTA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8298,"nextInTopic":8303,"prevInTime":8300,"nextInTime":8302,"topicId":8298,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello and welcome Cynthia...

I&#39;m thinking about unschooling my 2 boys ages 14 & 16. I&#39;ve never tried this before. We have used Abeka, Bob Jones, made my own curriculum, & now using Switched on Schoolhouse. I have heard that unschooling is where you just let them learn what they want to learn, is this correct? If so how do you get 2 teen boys to learn when they are not going to choose to learn anything unless they are made. How do you teach them math or english? They ask me all the time why do they have to learn the things that Switched on Schoolhouse is trying to teach them when they don&#39;t see they are ever going to use it in life, especially the History lessons. This is just a few questions I&#39;m concerned with.  Any help would be greatful, Cynthia<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
