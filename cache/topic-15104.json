So is the Environmental<br/>\nProtection Agency. They are working with the family but not doing a very<br/>\ngood job. The mother is only allowed over on weekends and is taking<br/>\nparenting classes but the grandmother railroads her efforts constantly. The<br/>\nfathers (2 different fathers, same mom) are working within the court system<br/>\nto see the kids.

The children are receiving<br/>\ncounseling.
