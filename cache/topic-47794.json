Many people on this list can compile laundry lists of woe, if we wanted to make a contest of it, but that sort of thinking gets in the way of living joyfully with our families. It helps enormously to shift your thinking to see what&#39;s wonderful in life. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s an old zen saying I remind myself of whenever I start to go into &quot;my life is so hard&quot; mode: before enlightenment, carry water, chop wood. After enlightenment: carry water, chop wood. The pure drudgery of life doesn&#39;t necessarily go away, but the way you think about it can change. It doesn&#39;t Have to be drudgery. It can be something you embrace wholeheartedly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA big, important place to begin is by taking a hard look at all the &quot;have tos&quot; in your life - that&#39;s something which will help all aspects of unschooling. Actively look for ways to change - change your circumstances, your expectations, your assumptions, you viewpoint. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I spend my life in the kitchen :-(<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re not happy with that, change it ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nOne way is to re-evaluate the logistics of all that food prep, as Schuyler suggested, add some appliances (freezer, dishwasher, microwave, for instance). Look into the idea of &quot;monkey platters&quot;, too  - if you&#39;re spending a lot of time making &quot;meals&quot; it may be better to switch to prepping snacks so they kids can nibble more at will:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter\">http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also look for ways to re-organize your household and lifestyle so that you&#39;re doing food prep in and around children - either do more where they are, or make the kitchen the center of the home, with all the fun stuff there. <br/>\n<br/>\nAND you can look for ways to feel good about all you do. If you&#39;re spending your days resenting being in the kitchen, you&#39;re serving your kids resentment and woe and undoing all the good of whatever you&#39;re cooking. They&#39;re not just bodies, after all, they&#39;re people - young, vulnerable people who depend on you for emotional sustenance as much as basic nutrition.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;We already spend more money on food than the mortgage some months. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My family does every month! Then again, we have a very low mortgage ;) But at the same time, I&#39;ve lived and cooked on very little money from time to time. There are ways to stretch the budget - and avoiding prepared foods is one of them, as is cooking in big batches. If you&#39;ve been making lots of individual meals, that&#39;s eating up money And time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be worth your while to plant a few easy-to-grow foods, like greens - in the house if necessary - and learn about wild harvesting. Those are both good ways to stretch your budge - vegetables are expensive! So the more you can do to cut out things like those Brussels sprouts entirely, the better. Wild harvesting is also a good way to spend an easy hour outside with little kids - and a good way for them to learn what&#39;s safe to eat and what is not.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut whatever you do, you and your family will be happier if you can approach it as a wonderful new adventure. Why else did you have kids? Your adventure is more challenging than you expected - hooray! You get to learn more, expand your mind and heart more, than you could ever have previously imagined! <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":335635580,"authorName":"Angeline Taylor","from":"Angeline Taylor &lt;RainbowSkyArts@...&gt;","profile":"horsegirl102","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Radical Unschooling - food and Feingold?","postDate":"1325105734","msgId":47815,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTlJuVl9aclpoUDh6T3BFSGF3dFE1WFI9ajdqTDloRF94aGp2WnVjMWpNemJDUE5QQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDU1RjQ4NThBLTQ3NjEtNDQ0Ny05RTg3LUZCNUExNDJDOTExMkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGpkZnBoYys1YTlsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NTVGNDg1OEEtNDc2MS00NDQ3LTlFODctRkI1QTE0MkM5MTEyQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":47814,"nextInTopic":47817,"prevInTime":47814,"nextInTime":47816,"topicId":47794,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Joyce - I just have to say I love your analogy!

For a family like mine though, it&#39;s not that easy. We must avoid gluten, dairy, corn, soy& egg due to confirmed allergies. And that&#39;s just for my two oldest children. The littlest one is sensitive to all those & cashews, almonds, beef, lamb and maybe a dozen or more other things.  He has never been at baseline (the absence of symptoms) in his short almost 30 months on the planet :-(.  There is no buying of packaged foods for us; I (or sometimes dh) must make everything. Everything.  I spend my life in the kitchen :-(.  It is very tough on aloust us that I spend so much time prepping, cooking & half heartedly cleaning up when I&#39;m done. I&#39;m sure there are ways that I could make things easier but doing something like using the food processor to chop means dh (the resident dishwasher) has to clean it rather than the cutting board. I&#39;m very distractable too which means I&#39;m not as efficient as I could possibly be, but not much I can do about that. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh and reactions to foods (either thru ingestion, inhilation or touching) often means disturbed sleep and/or floods of pee. All this translates into less sleep for me which means I&#39;m more tired the next day which means I lack the energy to try out that new recipe, or call that company to find out if they spray their Brussels sprouts with corn (yes, the fresh Brussels sprouts you&#39;re eating may be sprayed with corn!), to contact new CSA farm possibilities to find out if they too use the great new compostable & biodegradable &quot;black plastic mulch,&quot; that is made from corn starch, to play the game with the 6 y.o., to make Christmas presents for people, to write thank you notes, to read more to the 6 y.o., to sit & watch some tv with the littles without falling asleep, etc., etc., etc.  the list goes on. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, things are getting a little easier because dh is home FT now with a job where his office is at home.

Turned out to be wheat, soy, and peanuts that were the offending food, but wheat had the worst effect on him.  I think seeing me break down crying and have to pull over to the side of the road because he looked so bad (face gray in color, purple circles under his eyes, red rash all over his face)and he was screaming obscenities at me.  This kind of thing had been happening since he was 2 yo but I and the doctors did not know why it was happening.  The year prior to him going on the diet, I told him how I thought it might be wheat (just had a gut instinct).  So the day I broke down sobbing in the car, he decided to try going off the wheat.  He felt so much better after two weeks, he&#39;s never looked back.  There were tears the first several weeks over not being able to eat all his old favorites, but I always gave him the choice.  He would say &quot;no I don&#39;t want it&quot; as he was crying his heart out, but he did it voluntarily every time.  Now, on the occasion he accidentally eats an offending food, (typically from a cross contamination) he feels so bad, he can&#39;t imagine ever knowingly eating those foods.  My son is 11 years old, has been on his diet for almost a year now, and his health continues to improve.  I really believe that if I had forced him to do this, he would have &quot;cheated&quot; at every turn.  I felt like he was not in imminent danger, so I continued to give him the choice.  His sensitivities are serious enough that he may never be able to eat these foods.  One day he will be an adult, and will have to make these choices every day.  I won&#39;t be able to make those choices for him, so he may as well learn to make them now, at least that&#39;s the way I feel about it.  My son also tells me he is glad that he got to make this choice, and  that he continues to be in control of his diet.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those with younger children, I don&#39;t know what I would have done if I had found out what was causing his rages when he was very young.  It would have been a difficult thing to decide, I&#39;m sure.  Small children can&#39;t make truly informed decisions because they can&#39;t really know what effect these things have on their bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ushabug&quot; &lt;ushabug@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My oldest son (6) is on the Feingold diet.

It&#39;s neither necessary or desirable to give little children big, adult choices they can&#39;t handle. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help to use the analogy of a broken bone. That&#39;s not generally life threatening, but at the same time the option of Not having it treated at all isn&#39;t likely to be on the table! So you do what you can to make the unpleasant experience more bearable to your loved one. <br/>\n<br/>\nLife comes with real limits - and sometimes our bodies provide real limits. Where unschooling is different from most other kinds of parenting is that limits aren&#39;t automatically some kind of end point, they&#39;re just obstacles. As a parent, you get to help your child climb over and around and through many of those obstacles safely to help them meet their needs and learn about the world. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My oldest son (6) is on the Feingold diet.  It has been a miracle for him.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who have needs which require special diets or medication often want to experiment with the boundaries of that and gain a sense of control over themselves and their circumstances. As a parent, you have the option of helping them do that safely - help evaluate the pros and cons and make plans for a child who wants to try and may need time to recover afterwards. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son wants to explore the limits of what&#39;s &quot;safe&quot; to eat (and it&#39;s good to do so, since that&#39;s something which can change radically with time) help him do it gently and safely. Feingold is &quot;whole&quot; foods for the most part, right? So look for ways for him to try small amounts of processed foods now and then - while also planning for fallout if the experiment isn&#39;t successful. I don&#39;t mean you should stock your cabinets with things he can&#39;t eat - that would be cruel! But help him learn in a safe, supportive environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith careful experimentation, he might find that his diet can expand - or not, but it will be more meaningful for Him to learn the limits of what he can eat than to be told &quot;no, because I love you&quot; too many times. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":286930749,"authorName":"ushabug","from":"&quot;ushabug&quot; &lt;ushabug@...&gt;","profile":"ushabug","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Radical Unschooling - food and Feingold?","postDate":"1324665278","msgId":47794,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpkMmhqdSs2cmJmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47798,"prevInTime":47793,"nextInTime":47795,"topicId":47794,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My oldest son (6) is on the Feingold diet.
