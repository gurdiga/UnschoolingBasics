My dd 14/yo stays up until 3am on myspace and in chat rooms, and is now into webcam chatrooms, which she prefers, because &quot;at least you can see that people really are who they say they are. No one can pose as someone or something they are not.&quot; She has had the experience of being stalked on the internet by someone creepy. I think because she made the mistake of allowing someone into her &quot;friends&quot; on MySpace that she shouldnt have.

Fears about these  <br/>\nprograms stem from fears that children (implying all) will watch  <br/>\nviolence and sex unless we stop them. *All* children don&#39;t want to  <br/>\nwatch violence and sex. But the opposite isn&#39;t true. It isn&#39;t  <br/>\naccurate to say *all* children *don&#39;t* want to watch violence and sex.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough it might be accurate to say all children don&#39;t want to watch  <br/>\nsex. In 11 years on line talking about this stuff, I&#39;ve only talked  <br/>\nwith one woman whose young son wanted to see sexual situations. My  <br/>\nimmediate thought would be sexual abuse but it sounded like (and it&#39;s  <br/>\nobviously impossible to know) that wasn&#39;t the case. Barring that,  <br/>\ntalking further it wasn&#39;t totally clear that it wasn&#39;t something else  <br/>\nhe wanted to see. Maybe just naturally curious about sex and he got  <br/>\nthe idea that the only information about it was movies! Maybe just  <br/>\nhighly visual and needed to see the answers to his questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn these conversations about protecting kids from sex and violence on  <br/>\nTV it&#39;s common for a parent or two to pipe up and say &quot;Wait! My child  <br/>\nloves horror movies even though they give him/her nightmares.&quot; (Or  <br/>\njust loves horror movies period!) But it just doesn&#39;t happen that  <br/>\nparents say &quot;Wait! My child loves sex scenes in movies. He/she fast  <br/>\nforwards past all the talking to get to the sex.&quot;! Interest in sex  <br/>\nstems from hormones. When the body is ready (or on its way to ready)  <br/>\nto reproduce, the brain starts finding sex interesting. But 6 yos --  <br/>\nbarring some unusual biochemistry -- don&#39;t have the hormones and just  <br/>\naren&#39;t interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nViolence, on the other hand, is universally understandable -- though  <br/>\nnot universally enjoyable -- to everyone regardless of age. Violence  <br/>\nhas shaped our brains since time immemorial. Kill to eat. Crush  <br/>\nrivals to get access to sex. Admire the ability to crush rivals since  <br/>\nit indicates strong survivor genes. (Funny how it comes back to  <br/>\nsex ;-) We&#39;ve just added layers on top of the ancient impulses that  <br/>\ncontrol when it&#39;s okay to be violent. The ancient desires, needs,  <br/>\nattitudes are still there. They&#39;re just underneath other layers. So  <br/>\nit&#39;s perfectly naturally to kids to understand and appreciate (some  <br/>\nlevel) of violence.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll kids are searching for programs they enjoy. *Most* kids are going  <br/>\nto find adult movies and shows boring. There just isn&#39;t anything kid  <br/>\ndrawing about adults talking or kissing or having sex. As they flip  <br/>\nthrough channels, there&#39;s nothing that will make them want to stop  <br/>\nand watch. It&#39;s boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll kids understand the level of violence and horror they&#39;re  <br/>\ncomfortable with. It&#39;s perfectly natural for kids to test their  <br/>\nboundaries to see if they&#39;re able to handle what bothered them  <br/>\nbefore. It&#39;s part of growing. Even adults test their boundaries. And  <br/>\nit&#39;s really cool when we find something we can handle that we  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t before.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids are all along the spectrum when it comes to level of tolerance  <br/>\nfor violence. Some don&#39;t want to see any violence and are bothered by  <br/>\nintense situations. Some will watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre at 5 and  <br/>\nsay &quot;MOM! It&#39;s just a movie! Sheeesh!&quot; ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo rather than standing between a child and TV and wondering how to  <br/>\nprotect them from it, it&#39;s better to stand beside a child and look in  <br/>\nthe direction they&#39;re facing and wonder together how to do what is  <br/>\ninteresting them in ways that will be comfortable for them. Because  <br/>\nkids *do* want to be comfortable and safe. (Though some kids  <br/>\ndefinitions of comfortable my be testing their boundaries on horror  <br/>\nmovies!) They don&#39;t want to be surprised by violence that&#39;s way  <br/>\nbeyond boundaries they aren&#39;t interested in testing yet. They don&#39;t  <br/>\nwant to stumble across some scene that captures their interest that  <br/>\nturns into sex that confuses and scares them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo talk to them about what will help them see the things they want to  <br/>\nsee and avoid the things they don&#39;t want to see. Give them the tools  <br/>\nto help themselves be comfortable and safe. (But don&#39;t hand the  <br/>\nresponsibility of being safe over to them. It&#39;s still our job to keep  <br/>\non helping them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp them find the channels they&#39;ll feel comfortable with if they&#39;re  <br/>\ngoing to be up late and help them recognize the channels that might  <br/>\nhave things that will bother them. *Ask* the kids if they&#39;d like  <br/>\ncertain channels blocked so they don&#39;t even have to flip past them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust that they want to stay close to their comfort zone and talk  <br/>\ntogether about ideas on how to do that. Trust that they *don&#39;t want  <br/>\nto see* violence that&#39;s beyond the boundaries they aren&#39;t ready to  <br/>\ntest. Help them figure out how to stay in their comfort zone. Give  <br/>\nthem the tools that will help them do what they want (watch TV, surf  <br/>\nthe internet) and help them avoid the things they want to avoid.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven with all the tools, we can&#39;t, of course, protect them from ever  <br/>\nseeing something they don&#39;t want to see. And when that happens, we  <br/>\ncan help them build up more tools on how to handle surprising  <br/>\nsituations and how to cope with the unexpected. Those are tools that  <br/>\ncan serve them for a lifetime. Protecting them prevents them from  <br/>\nacquiring those tools.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And some kids do want to push hard on the boundaries of their  <br/>\ncomfort zones. They want horror movies even though they&#39;re scared.  <br/>\nThere are ways to help kids explore those boundaries. If we&#39;re their  <br/>\npartner rather than their protector, they&#39;ll be more likely to reach  <br/>\nout for help rather than pushing themselves too far in fear that  <br/>\ncontrols will come down and they won&#39;t be able to see what fascinates/ <br/>\nscares them.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is their no such thing as &quot;age appropriate?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Strictly speaking, no.

I personally would never lull myself<br/>\ninto a false sense of security of my child¹s safely based on my open<br/>\nrelationship with them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGuidance is very different from coercion, control and limits. Guidance<br/>\ninvolves shared information and a lot of trust. <br/>\n<br/>\nThree of my four children have myspace accounts. First of all, myspace<br/>\nallows you to set your profile to &quot;private&quot; which means that anyone<br/>\nwanting to be added to your friends list has to know certain<br/>\ninformation first. Secondly, nobody gets on your friends list without<br/>\nyour approval even if you DON&#39;T have it set to private!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the parent is the child&#39;s partner, the child has a trusted adult<br/>\nto run information past. Sierra calls me in occasionally and asks me<br/>\nwho certain people are before she adds them...usually it&#39;s some<br/>\nunschooled child we met at a past conference. She chats regularly with<br/>\n57 friends and loves it! She&#39;s learned to type pretty fast, has<br/>\nlearned a ton of spelling and enjoys her online social group immensely.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe knows that some people lie about who they are. Even if someone DID<br/>\nmanage to convince her they were a 9year old friend when they weren&#39;t,<br/>\nhow on earth are they going to lure her away?? All my children know<br/>\nthat when you meet someone from the internet for the first time, you<br/>\nmake sure it is a public place etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of our close friends are people we met online. If it were that<br/>\ndangerous, we should have met at least ONE creepy person by now. We<br/>\nhaven&#39;t. Not one. That doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t out there, doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmean it won&#39;t happen, but I DO think that unschoolers raised<br/>\nrespectfully and with involved parents are pretty much immune to<br/>\ngetting cornered.<br/>\n<br/>\nANYONE can get harrassed. Not just anyone can get cornered or lured<br/>\ninto a bad situation. NO matter how inexperienced a child is, why on<br/>\nearth wouldn&#39;t they be telling their parents about someone they met<br/>\nonline that they want to meet in real life??? In a trusting<br/>\nrelationship, that is NOT an issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of my children would tell me if they met someone online and wanted<br/>\nto meet up with that person. All of them know to be cautious until<br/>\nthey get to know someone. I have NO concerns about them being sneaky<br/>\n(they have NO reason to be) because they don&#39;t get in trouble. Ever.<br/>\nI don&#39;t punish any of them. EVER. Very different situation than what<br/>\nmost kids deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a false sense of security. It&#39;s a true sense of security. And<br/>\nnot because I don&#39;t believe bad things can happen to anyone...I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t fear my child being lured away under false pretenses because<br/>\nthey&#39;d be TALKING to me before they met anyone!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: question on TV","postDate":"1164468631","msgId":19272,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVrOW5pbitwZ2lrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEMxOEQwRkFFLjk0RUQlbWVseW5kYWxhdXJlbnRAbW4ucnIuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19268,"nextInTopic":19283,"prevInTime":19271,"nextInTime":19273,"topicId":19236,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... respectfully ... adept at ... are good ...

Especially on late night cable channels. Do you all feel comfortable with them watching whatever they find that happens to be on the airwaves?

He&#39;ll go upstairs to watch Cartoon Network, or I&#39;ll change the <br/>\nchannel (I LOVE TiVO! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron, at 18 chooses That 70s Show---and that&#39;s about it. We all <br/>\nwatch My Name is Earl and Family Guy. Cameron likes scary <br/>\nmovies---Horror, I mean. I won&#39;t watch them---unless it&#39;s Stephen King <br/>\nor M. Night Shamalan. But Cam and his girlfriend love to be scared. He <br/>\ndidn&#39;t as a child. He did it as he was ready. They like Saw. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nIs their no such thing as &quot;age appropriate?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSure---and at his age, he finds sex and violence to be inappropriate <br/>\nfor him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe even asks whether a movie is &quot;R&quot;---not that he hasn&#39;t seen plenty of <br/>\n&quot;R&quot;-rated movies. Just somewhere in his brain, he thinks he needs to <br/>\n*ask* about them---maybe due to TV commercials??? I&#39;ll say that it&#39;s <br/>\nviolent or has sex scenes or maybe rough language---whatever the reason <br/>\nmight be for the rating. But there&#39;s no movie with language as bad as <br/>\nmy *own*, so I know that doesn&#39;t bother him. The sex (even just love <br/>\nscenes) and violence are enough to keep him from watching.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think a six year old child will CHOOSE to watch sex and <br/>\nviolence? Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=--=<br/>\n<br/>\n Or do you excercise some kind of control, like<br/>\nlimiting the amount or kind of programming you allow through <br/>\nsupervision,<br/>\nV-chips, not having cable or other technologies?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNope. I&#39;m not usually far away if he has a question. We have unlimited <br/>\nTV, computer, video games, TiVo, books, and most of all TALK. I&#39;m <br/>\nwilling to talk about *anything* with them---and I can assure you we&#39;ve <br/>\nhad some UNUSUAL conversations. About stuff that would make the devil <br/>\nblush and wash his ears! &lt;G&gt; But they know I won&#39;t laugh or put them <br/>\noff. If I *do* put them off because of the timing, I&#39;m *sure* to <br/>\naddress it at the soonest possible moment. They trust me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  And if you do not limit TV content do you also not limit internet <br/>\ncontent?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNope---that either.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are too smart on the computer anyway! &lt;G&gt; They have to show me <br/>\nhow to navigate. If *I* thought I could put up some kind of workable <br/>\nbarrier... &lt;g&gt; No way!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.

Hubby likes to watch all the shoot em up, blood and gore movies.  The more dead bodies and blood the better in hubbies T.V. viewing time.  I try to direct our girls (ages 6 & 8) to the upstairs tv if he is watching this stuff.  Sexual Content does not bother me depending on what it is..........if it&#39;s some type of violent rape then I don&#39;t want the girls watching it. Swearing does not bother me if the girls see it......I figure they will eventually know all those words anyway.   My 6 year old does not watch tv much.  She would rather do any number of things than watch tv.  My 8 year old is obsessed with tv, but she does do other things.  Right now she is outside riding her bike.  My girls watch a lot of Animal Planet in addition to Nicholodeon.  Also Lexi my 8 year old watches that show on TLC about the women giving birth.  She loves that show, and she is either going to have lots of kids or become an OB/GYN.......not<br/>\n sure which......maybe both.<br/>\n  I guess some issues have not come up in our house yet, like my girls only go on the internet for their Time 4 Learning program.  I keep hearing about all these internet sexual predators so I know the day is coming that I will have to address the going on sites like MY SPACE and e-mailing all their friends.  I have heard some horror stories.  Now last night my 6 year old stayed up till 11:30, but not to watch tv.  She was deeply involved in an Art/Craft Project.  My 6 year old does her best work at night........seems to be her most creative time.  <br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:airokat@...\">airokat@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n          If you have lots and lots of channels and your children watch TV anytime they want for as long they want and stay up as late as they want how do you deal with TV content that might not be &quot;age appropriate?&quot; There are shows that contain images that can be very scary for a three year old or shows containg explicit sexual content that kids might not understand at, say, 6 years of age.
