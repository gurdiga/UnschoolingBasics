For all the reasons you have already stated. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I think whats most important is that parents consider their childrens needs and feeling in the whole equation instead of saying well I want to go to outback steakhouse and you are going to sit quietly and like it or else! <br/>\n   <br/>\n  If my kiddos come with us we do our best to bring them not overly hungry, in good moods and with things to occupy them. Often we find it easier to leave the kiddos with someone occasionly and go just the 2 of us. At 7 and under they will usualy choose happy meals from mcdonalds and a picnic in the back yard over sitting at o&#39; charleys. <br/>\n  And dh and I as adults must admit the we enjoy an occasional kid free conversation.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

I have definately seen my share of mean parents, just like you have described.<br/>\nNoisy kids are not a real big deal, stacking jellies as high as you can? Cool with me. Just put &#39;em back before you leave.<br/>\nStanding on the seat of the booth? Very uncool. Would you let me or my kids come to your home and stand on your chairs? Seat fabric takes alot of wear in a restaurant and is very expensive to repair or replace.<br/>\nHere are my suggestions:<br/>\n1. Stay in your seats as much as you can. If a kid gets itchy, take them for a walk outside, look at the landscaping, check out the rear of the building and see how stuff is handled back there, go look at the pie case. But PLEASE don&#39;t let your child stand at the edge of the booth or between tables. Servers come through dining rooms very quickly and are carrying trays of hot food. It is almost impossible to see little ones in the aisles when you have 5 or 6 plates stacked on your arms. Restaurant ware is extra heavy and durable. Even one plate dropping on a little noggin could be a severe injury.<br/>\n2. If you pass crackers along to your tots, PLEASE check the seats and floors around your table for trash and crumbs before you leave. Servers are required to keep their areas clean for the next group occupying a table and every minute spent cleaning up after people is $$ out of their pockets. I could spend 10 minutes cleaning after each table leaves, and if I turn over each table six times in a shift, that is an hour that I have worked for $2.15 cents. I could turn that table over a seventh time and make 5 times that.<br/>\n3. The federal government has mandated that servers do not need to make minimum wage, the average restaurant pays its servers between $2.10 and $2.20 per hour. At my restaurant, I average $85 per shift. Out of that we must pay 2.5% of our total sales to bussers and the bar, even if our tips for the night are poor. I&#39;ve had to give out as much as $20 tip-out on a $65 dollar night. In addition to that tip out, I have to pay taxes based on my total sales (not on how much I actually earn). Please keep this in mind when you come in with children. As we all know children ARE messier than adults and waiting on families tends to be more work intensive. Please keep that in mind when you tip your servers. Personally, I tip 20% unless the service is bad (and it&#39;s gotta be REALLY bad for me to tip less. As a server myself, I am very forgiving) and when I go in with little ones I tip closer to 23%<br/>\nYMMV. :o)<br/>\nElissa Jill<br/>\nA Kindersher saychel iz oychet a saychel.<br/>\n&quot;A Child&#39;s wisdom is also wisdom.&quot; ~Yiddish Proverb<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Other parents (WAS: unschooling vs. radical unschooling)","postDate":"1153423192","msgId":15913,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5b2wwbysxdHZ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTEwMi1GNDNGRkM3ODI4MEI1NTU1RTNFQzc4QjA2MTBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":15911,"nextInTopic":15915,"prevInTime":15912,"nextInTime":15914,"topicId":15770,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That s why we often pick strategically located tables and request them specifically.

We&#39;ll do thumb wars, arm wrestling, <br/>\nwhatever. And sometimes we sit outside and wait (helps if both DH <br/>\nand I have our cell phones - DH can call us when food arrives). One <br/>\nfavorite place has those claw machine things in the lobby/waiting <br/>\narea so we make sure to bring a handful of quarters with us and <br/>\nwe&#39;ll play there while waiting to sit and go back there if the <br/>\nservice is slow (it rarely is at this place, if you time it right - <br/>\nsee below).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also try to time things - NO going to certain restaurants on <br/>\nFriday or Saturday evenings - too much wait, too long for service <br/>\nbecause the kitchen is super-busy, etc. Sometimes we&#39;ll have a snack <br/>\nin transit, before we leave the house, or even sitting at the table <br/>\nif need be (that&#39;s where asking for several packs of crackers AS we <br/>\nsit comes in) and I have no qualms about producing a couple packets <br/>\nof crackers from my purse as needed. (DH jokes that my purse is a <br/>\nmagic black hole - it always seems to have exactly what we need as <br/>\nwe need it). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sometimes we just don&#39;t even bother going out - we know that <br/>\nwe&#39;re all tired or whatever and it&#39;s just better to go home and eat <br/>\nPBJs in calm than to try to get a meal at a restaurant. And, too, <br/>\nsince Joshua has spent most of his life eating at restaurants on a <br/>\nregular basis, he&#39;s kind of used to it. Plus, a big one that a lot <br/>\nof &quot;mainstream&quot; families don&#39;t get, is that HE also has a say in <br/>\nwhere we go and has since he could express his opinion. So, for <br/>\nexample, we don&#39;t go to Chili&#39;s as a family - it&#39;s too loud and busy <br/>\nfor him. If DH and I really really want Chili&#39;s food, we go when <br/>\nJoshua is at Grandma&#39;s or work some other arrangements out. Just as <br/>\nsince DH doesn&#39;t like another particular restaurant that Joshua and <br/>\nI like, so he stays home and Joshua and I go there occasionally on <br/>\nour mom & son dates.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Other parents (WAS: unschooling vs. radical unschooling)","postDate":"1153422286","msgId":15911,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5b2s0ZSsyaGQ3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA3MjAxMDU3cTQwNmY1ZmVjbDJlYWU5Nzk0M2M0ZWIzODhAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15910,"nextInTopic":15913,"prevInTime":15910,"nextInTime":15912,"topicId":15770,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...  wrote: Oh Michelle I know and I ve done it too - Joshua is a 110% energy boy - BUT the whole tone of that group was sit down and ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-577760071\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Michelle/Melbrigða&quot; <br/>\n&lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\nOh Michelle I know and I&#39;ve done it too - Joshua is a 110% energy <br/>\nboy - BUT the whole tone of that group was &quot;sit down and <br/>\nbehave &#39;properly&#39; and don&#39;t be a bother to us&quot;.

It just works good for us to teach them to express things like this so we can take care of it before they become a big disruption to others. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I also keep a couple of bags packed in my trunk. One is you basic changes of clothes, blanket diapers etc. The other I try to change out with new suprises in ...but paper, bottles of mini bubbles, cards etc...........I find this really helpful when we have to go to dr appts and I have no choice but to take all of them and its hard to leave because we are waiting for our name to be called. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have to say my children&#39;s old pediatrician knew just what she was doing. She had her practice in an old house and there was the normal inside waiting room with toys n such , then a fenced in &quot;waiting yard&quot; :) <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nGroups are talking.

Not as<br/>\npunishment, but as relief for the child.  Keon does not sit and wait<br/>\nwell.  Sometimes he is just so restless that being in a restaurant<br/>\nwaiting for food is anguishing.  It&#39;s never been a big deal.  I&#39;ve<br/>\neven taken him out with a menu to sit on a bench outside and used my<br/>\ncell phone to &quot;phone in&quot; our orders!  LOL!  I truly believe that it<br/>\nwas physically uncomfortable for Keon to sit and wait while he watched<br/>\nother tables having food brought to them.  Sadly, many times when we<br/>\nhave walked out of a restaurant I have heard people say presumingly,<br/>\n&quot;OH I bet he&#39;s in for it now!&quot; Meaning that he is being punished, when<br/>\nthe opposite is true. I&#39;ve even had our meals packed in a to go box<br/>\nand then gone outside to sit and eat because he just didn&#39;t want to be<br/>\nthere in that restaurant at that moment.

Anyhow, the table across from us was 3 adults and a <br/>\ntoddler, looked about 2 maybe 3 at most. She was standing next <br/>\nto &quot;dad&quot; (just guessing at the various roles/relationships). &quot;mom&quot; <br/>\nwas standing, cutting up something on a plate at the place adjacent <br/>\nto the &quot;dad&quot; which I can only guess was the tot&#39;s seat.

I just want to say to the parents, please stop NOW and<br/>\nlook at how you are treating your children.  It helps me feel better<br/>\nby interacting and playing with their children and treating them with<br/>\nrespect.  I am amazed every time I do this that the children respond<br/>\nso well when treated respectfully, even when it is for a short time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I have to say that I am getting a bit more selective with who I<br/>\nhang out with these days, myself. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n**I hear ya. I never thought twice about these sorts of comments before I <br/>\nfound unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m finding more things that I can&#39;t comfortably attend anymore with my son. <br/>\nOne is an indoor/outdoor play gathering for toddlers in our area. It&#39;s kind <br/>\nof like a huge open gym full of toys and riding toys, etc. and then an <br/>\noutdoor area that people spill into after the gym closes (lots of water <br/>\nfeatures/sprinklers, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last time we were there, another mom with a girl the same age as my son <br/>\n(2) was just constantly tearing apart her daughter. Snacks brought on a <br/>\nlittany of, &quot;only eat one at a time&quot; and &quot;hey, watch it, not so many&quot;. She <br/>\nwas sharing her snacks with other kids and her mom said to the other moms <br/>\n(out loud, of course), &quot;don&#39;t worry if your kids eat all her snacks - no one <br/>\neats as much as my daughter and she could use a break&quot;. Then she promptly <br/>\ncut her off and packed away the snacks - little girl screaming and crying.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, she was loudly complaining about how her daughter doesn&#39;t want to use <br/>\nthe potty and she doesn&#39;t understand why she is still in diapers (at 2?). <br/>\nShe said that all she wants to do in the bathroom is brush her teeth <br/>\nconstantly and, &quot;that&#39;s all she would do all day if I didn&#39;t put a stop to <br/>\nit&quot;. Later she rushed to check her daughter&#39;s diaper while she was in the <br/>\nmiddle of playing and the girl was upset at being interrupted. Her mom said, <br/>\n&quot;well, if you&#39;d learn to use the potty we wouldn&#39;t have this problem&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this in a really big gym and my son and I weren&#39;t even close. So many <br/>\nlittle fights and arguments for nothing. So many detrimental words and <br/>\nactions in such a short time. My son kept staring at the little girl and <br/>\npointing out how she was crying. It&#39;s tough to watch and I&#39;m actively <br/>\nseeking out other types of parents, too!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLesa O&#39;Daniel, AAHCC<br/>\nInstructor, Bradley Method� of Natural Childbirth<br/>\n323-541-5515<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bradleybirth.com/ndweb.asp?ID=O123&Count=N\">http://www.bradleybirth.com/ndweb.asp?ID=O123&Count=N</a><br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

We were at a<br/>\nfriend&#39;s house this past Friday night.  There was another mother there<br/>\nwith her 5yo daughter.  She was a bright sweet joyful child and how<br/>\nshe has retained that joy is beyond me!  Her mother had all these<br/>\nrules and controlled everything that she did and ate.  The child had<br/>\nto eat at the table and had 2 measured tablespoons of food on her<br/>\nplate.  I am NOT kidding.  She ha 1 T of mac-n-cheese and 1 T of a<br/>\ncasserole.  The child ate it and was still hungry.  Asked for more.<br/>\n&quot;No; that is all you need.  There is sufficient nutrients in what you<br/>\nhad to eat.&quot; (While the mother sat there eating a huge bowl of food!)<br/>\n&quot;May I have a cookie?&quot;  LONG pause &quot;I suppose so, but you have to eat<br/>\nit at the table.&quot;  (My kids were munching on a piece of bread in the<br/>\nworkshop while playing and watching tv.)  Later the child did a<br/>\ncartwheel headfirst into a coffee table.  She was screaming.  It&#39;s<br/>\nthat &quot;I need my mommy I&#39;m in horrible pain and scared&quot; scream that<br/>\nmakes me drop everything I am doing and run to my child.  We had to<br/>\ntell the mother THREE times that her child needed her.  Then the<br/>\nmother barely held the child and only reprimanded her for doing<br/>\ncartwheels in the house.  &quot;That&#39;s what you get for doing cartwheels<br/>\nwhere they don&#39;t belong.  Next time you won&#39;t do that will you.&quot;  No<br/>\ncomfort, no compassion, no empathy for having a huge goose egg on her<br/>\nhead.  My heart yearned so badly for this child.  I wanted to grab her<br/>\nfrom her mother and hold her and stroke her hair and kiss her forehead<br/>\nand soothe her poor battered body and kiss her little tears away.  All<br/>\nI kept thinking all evening was, &quot;I just wish she showed a little<br/>\ngentleness and love towards this child.&quot;  All the reaction between<br/>\nmother and child was clinical and sterile and reprimanding.  :-(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: unschooling vs. radical unschooling","postDate":"1153052349","msgId":15796,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU5MS4xNzNkOTcwMC4zMWViODhiZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15793,"nextInTopic":15798,"prevInTime":15795,"nextInTime":15797,"topicId":15770,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ya know what?
