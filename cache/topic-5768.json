You sound like a true unschooler.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only do we NOT know exactly what skills our children need, the<br/>\ncoercion and crap surrounding &quot;teaching&quot; actually hinders the learning<br/>\nprocess. With unschooling, learning is important but teaching does not<br/>\nmatter. I would go as far as to say there is no such thing as<br/>\nteaching, only learning (to semi-quote a famous brainiac).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a skill is &quot;basic&quot;, that means it&#39;s basic to living, it&#39;s useful<br/>\nfor day to day LIFE.  If it&#39;s something &quot;basic&quot;, then we will<br/>\nnaturally come across it all the time. If it&#39;s &quot;basic&quot; to living, then<br/>\nwhy would there be ANY need to teach it or try to instill it? It&#39;s<br/>\nBASIC.

I&#39;d like to share some rambling, half-formed thoughts, and see<br/>\nwhere they go. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest difficulty I see in trying to &quot;teach&quot; our kids skills that might<br/>\ncome up later is this: how do we know what those skills will be?  I know my<br/>\nhusband&#39;s viewpoint in this is that a typical public school education will<br/>\ncover everything, one way or another, and that way you know you&#39;re covered.<br/>\nOf course the vast majority of that (IMHO) is boring, almost immediately<br/>\nforgotten, or never really absorbed in the first place due to lack of<br/>\ninterest.  So there is all that time wasted (again, IMO) with info that they<br/>\nmay or may not need later on.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThinking about my children&#39;s days, I can see where they are picking up the<br/>\nbasics of life without a major curriculum surrounding them.  To pull from<br/>\nthe examples you used below; they both love the computer, so typing is being<br/>\npracticed all the time.  Accounting isn&#39;t something I know how to do, except<br/>\nfor the basics of balancing a checkbook - and that is learned when you get a<br/>\nbank account, usually in your teen years.  I don&#39;t actually know what<br/>\n&quot;lettering&quot; is in regards to art, so I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t know how to do<br/>\nthat, lol!  But if I was an artist I suppose I would have come across it at<br/>\nsome point.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI can also think of plenty of skills that I needed for a job, but didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave when I got the job.  No biggie, I&#39;m a smart, curious girl, so I picked<br/>\nthose up as I went along.  I think most people do that without thinking much<br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy hope is that my children will learn to learn.  They will aquire the<br/>\nskills that enable them to figure out a problem, to find information that<br/>\nthey need, to learn essential skills.  That way, no matter what they do in<br/>\nlife, they will be well prepared to succeed.  Not because they have a bunch<br/>\nof facts stuffed in their heads (although they might have that too, curious<br/>\nlittle buggers that they are, lol!).  But because they know how to learn.<br/>\nAnd anyway, who says typing will even be used in 15-20 years?  Maybe<br/>\neveryone will be talking to computers in a Star Trekkie way!  So there is a<br/>\nskill that a kid might never need to know.  Not that the knowledge itself is<br/>\nworthless and bad.  But if they didn&#39;t want to know it in the first place,<br/>\nbut were forced to do so, that&#39;s what I want to avoid.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRamblin&#39;...ramblin&#39; thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShell & Da Boys <br/>\n<br/>\nDrew, 6.5 and Josh, 2.5<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is like riding a bicycle.

However I&#39;ve had many jobs where I<br/>\nneeded skills that weren&#39;t part of the major focus of<br/>\nthe job. For example as a social worker I needed to<br/>\ntype so I could do all the form filling required. As a<br/>\nmember of a community organization I needed to do<br/>\naccounting to help keep the project together. In a<br/>\nrequired art class I had to learn to do lettering and<br/>\nit was later essential when I was making signs for a<br/>\nstreet department I worked for.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure I could have tried to learn these things at the<br/>\npoint when I desperately needed them at work, but it<br/>\nwas also nice to already have them. If I hadn&#39;t had<br/>\nthem I couldn&#39;t have done the job.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps I&#39;m just a dabbler, but I like knowing very<br/>\ndifferent things. Many are NOT things I was initially<br/>\ndrawn to by my personal interests. The interest<br/>\ndeveloped as I was exposed to the subject in some more<br/>\ngeneral class/ life requirement. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m just wondering how folks integrate doing<br/>\njust what you want with things I consider tasks. Tasks<br/>\nto me are things that I wouldn&#39;t do except I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave the money to hire someone else to do them. They<br/>\nare things I&#39;ve learned to do as part of my life&#39;s<br/>\nrequirements. These include some things I do to keep<br/>\nmy house functioning (repairs/maint) and things I do<br/>\nto keep my businesses going. Even with my own business<br/>\nthere are always aspects I find not very interesting<br/>\nor motivating.

However I&#39;ve had many jobs where I<br/>\nneeded skills that weren&#39;t part of the major focus of<br/>\nthe job. For example as a social worker I needed to<br/>\ntype so I could do all the form filling required. As a<br/>\nmember of a community organization I needed to do<br/>\naccounting to help keep the project together.

They<br/>\nare things I&#39;ve learned to do as part of my life&#39;s<br/>\nrequirements.

Dan woke at about 7 am <br/>\n&gt; (his usual time) and we snuggled for a while.  I puttered around <br/>\n&gt; and thought about breakfast, while Dan watched some morning TV.  I <br/>\n&gt; made breakfast for me and Dan -- Andy had quietly gotten up around <br/>\n&gt; 9 am and fetched a bowl of cereal for himself. At Andy&#39;s request, <br/>\n&gt; I called the Mom we were meeting later in the day twice, first to <br/>\n&gt; say we&#39;d be later than usual and ask her to sign Andy up early <br/>\n&gt; (the workshop fills up fast), then to ask her son to bring his yu-<br/>\n&gt; gi-oh cards.  <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;  The boys played inside and outside for much of the morning, <br/>\n&gt; while I did some reading and searched my arcane filing system <br/>\n&gt; looking for the paperwork we&#39;ll need for the mortgage lenders next <br/>\n&gt; week when we meet (we&#39;re house-shopping!).  Several times thru the <br/>\n&gt; morning, Will asked what time it was, since he was scheduled to be <br/>\n&gt; at work at 2pm, and was still trying to sleep on the couch. <br/>\n&gt; Everyone had at least one turn at the computer to game or chat. I <br/>\n&gt; explained to Will that his work start-time conflicted with Andy&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; regular Tues activity, so Will offered that I could drop him off <br/>\n&gt; at work at 1:30 pm (he&#39;ll be moving into his own place this <br/>\n&gt; weekend, so one less person for me to cart around -- yippee!).<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;  At 1:15 or so we all headed for the car, with both me and Will <br/>\n&gt; heading back inside for one last forgotten thing (usual for us).  <br/>\n&gt; Dropped Will at work, hit the Wendy&#39;s drive up for nuggets and <br/>\n&gt; sodas, then off to the kids&#39; museum where Andy goes to a weekly <br/>\n&gt; computer-robotics workshop.  This is a relatively new thing for <br/>\n&gt; him.  Several weeks ago, we were there on a Tuesday, ran into a <br/>\n&gt; family of unschoolers we hadn&#39;t seen in more than a year and found <br/>\n&gt; that our boys hit it off great (the two older ones hadn&#39;t years <br/>\n&gt; ago).  Between us, there are two 9yo boys and two 5yo boys, and <br/>\n&gt; everyone had a great time playing.  G asked Andy to do the robo <br/>\n&gt; workshop with him, Andy loved it and we made a standing date to <br/>\n&gt; meet at the museum mid-morning Tuesday.  <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;  We all left the museum at 4pm, they to another date, we to try <br/>\n&gt; out the just-reopened (yesterday) playground/park across the <br/>\n&gt; street.  It&#39;s been a favorite playground, and we&#39;ve waited months <br/>\n&gt; for the update to be finished. The boys tried out all the new <br/>\n&gt; equipment, and the old stuff, enjoying the yummy spring day.  At <br/>\n&gt; about 5:20, we headed towards home, with a stop at Sonic for <br/>\n&gt; shakes to keep us company as we sat in rush-hour traffic.  <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;  At home the boys played, squabbled some, and hung out with their <br/>\n&gt; daddy.  People had dinner, watched TV or whatever thru the <br/>\n&gt; evening.  By 9:20, dh was back from picking Will up at work, Dan <br/>\n&gt; was asleep, and Andy was in his room playing with legos (his legos <br/>\n&gt; are out constantly, and he tinkers with them whenever he&#39;s in his <br/>\n&gt; room) and watching TV.  <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;  Dh and I set up his coffee and packed his lunch for today, then <br/>\n&gt; were in bed by 10, since he gets up at 4:30.<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;  Along the way in our day, the boys and I talked about music, the <br/>\n&gt; yard/moving sale we&#39;re planning, which toys and books we can sell <br/>\n&gt; off and what they&#39;ll do with their share of the income.  <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;  We&#39;re all talking lately about what we want in a house we&#39;ll buy <br/>\n&gt; sometime this summer (both boys have asked for stairs and Dan <br/>\n&gt; wants to be able to walk to visit his best friend), my niece&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; visit this July, Dan&#39;s soccer plans for August and Andy&#39;s desire <br/>\n&gt; to start archery lessons, but not until after his birthday in June <br/>\n&gt; (I don&#39;t know why he wants to wait, but they&#39;re his plans not <br/>\n&gt; mine) and the upcoming trip to Grand Canyon/Las Vegas in July to <br/>\n&gt; see the grandparents and a huge family reunion, so those <br/>\n&gt; conversations swirl thru most of our days lately.  <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;  This was harder than I thought it would be. When we spend our <br/>\n&gt; days living free lives, it all sort of runs together and becomes <br/>\n&gt; one big mural of life, with different moments and words relating <br/>\n&gt; to other thing in very stream of consciousness ways.  It feels to <br/>\n&gt; me like just the way life is supposed to be.<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt;  Sylvia <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;          Mom to Will (21) Andy (9) and Dan (5) <br/>\n&gt;     <br/>\n&gt;  Let the beauty you love be what you do  --  Rumi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;                \t<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I explained to Will that his work start-time conflicted with Andy&#39;s regular Tues activity, so Will offered that I could drop him off at work at 1:30 pm (he&#39;ll be moving into his own place this weekend, so one less person for me to cart around -- yippee!).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  At 1:15 or so we all headed for the car, with both me and Will heading back inside for one last forgotten thing (usual for us).  Dropped Will at work, hit the Wendy&#39;s drive up for nuggets and sodas, then off to the kids&#39; museum where Andy goes to a weekly computer-robotics workshop.  This is a relatively new thing for him.  Several weeks ago, we were there on a Tuesday, ran into a family of unschoolers we hadn&#39;t seen in more than a year and found that our boys hit it off great (the two older ones hadn&#39;t years ago).  Between us, there are two 9yo boys and two 5yo boys, and everyone had a great time playing.  G asked Andy to do the robo workshop with him, Andy loved it and we made a standing date to meet at the museum mid-morning Tuesday.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We all left the museum at 4pm, they to another date, we to try out the just-reopened (yesterday) playground/park across the street.  It&#39;s been a favorite playground, and we&#39;ve waited months for the update to be finished. The boys tried out all the new equipment, and the old stuff, enjoying the yummy spring day.  At about 5:20, we headed towards home, with a stop at Sonic for shakes to keep us company as we sat in rush-hour traffic.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  At home the boys played, squabbled some, and hung out with their daddy.  People had dinner, watched TV or whatever thru the evening.  By 9:20, dh was back from picking Will up at work, Dan was asleep, and Andy was in his room playing with legos (his legos are out constantly, and he tinkers with them whenever he&#39;s in his room) and watching TV.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Dh and I set up his coffee and packed his lunch for today, then were in bed by 10, since he gets up at 4:30.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Along the way in our day, the boys and I talked about music, the yard/moving sale we&#39;re planning, which toys and books we can sell off and what they&#39;ll do with their share of the income.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We&#39;re all talking lately about what we want in a house we&#39;ll buy sometime this summer (both boys have asked for stairs and Dan wants to be able to walk to visit his best friend), my niece&#39;s visit this July, Dan&#39;s soccer plans for August and Andy&#39;s desire to start archery lessons, but not until after his birthday in June (I don&#39;t know why he wants to wait, but they&#39;re his plans not mine) and the upcoming trip to Grand Canyon/Las Vegas in July to see the grandparents and a huge family reunion, so those conversations swirl thru most of our days lately.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  This was harder than I thought it would be. When we spend our days living free lives, it all sort of runs together and becomes one big mural of life, with different moments and words relating to other thing in very stream of consciousness ways.  It feels to me like just the way life is supposed to be.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Mom to Will (21) Andy (9) and Dan (5) <br/>\n     <br/>\n  Let the beauty you love be what you do  --  Rumi<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

He got<br/>\ndressed so he could go outside and water the garden and check on the<br/>\nplants.  He asked me if I would get dressed and come out with him.  I told<br/>\nhim I needed to shower first and was told to &quot;well make it snappy.  Those<br/>\nplants are thirsty!&quot;  So I went and showered.  When I came out Mary Elayne<br/>\nhad woken (this was around 8:30)  I asked her if she was ok and she said,<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m tired, but the house is too awake for me to sleep.&quot;  (Whoever decided<br/>\nthat we still need time changes is WRONG! :) )  She went and grabbed<br/>\nsomething for breakfast and curled up in front of the tv for a while to eat<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeon and I finally headed outside where we dumped the compost, gave the pile<br/>\na stir, watered the plants and refilled the buckets for the next watering.<br/>\nWe watched a red skink slink around the water spigot and inspected the<br/>\ngarden to see which plants were really starting to grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeon reminded me that Narnia was coming on dvd today and could we go buy<br/>\nit.  Then he wanted to know if we could use the Dairy Queen coupons that<br/>\nwere in this past sunday&#39;s paper.  Sure, why not.  We asked Emily if she<br/>\nwanted to join us (it&#39;s now around 11:00) and she asked if she could take a<br/>\nshower to help her wake up because she really wanted to go to  Target with<br/>\nus.  (Whoever decided that we still need time changes is WRONG! :) )<br/>\n<br/>\nAround 12:15 or so we got in the car and took off to DQ (food first ya know)<br/>\nwhere we sat outside and watched the construction of the new interstate<br/>\nbridge (our DQ overlooks a bay and the bridge that spans it was torn apart<br/>\nby Ivan).  We watched barges pass underneath heading to the power station<br/>\nand huge cranes lifting concrete and metal.  We talked about why the bridge<br/>\nwas destroyed and how it is being rebuilt much higher.  We enjoyed the<br/>\nsunshine while we munched our lunch.  We went to Target, found the DVD and<br/>\nbought some fun looking outdoor toys to play with when we got home.  And we<br/>\ndid.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s now around 2:30.  The kids played outside while I checked my e-mail and<br/>\nprocessed a show for my business and made some phone calls to various people<br/>\nregarding an unschooling family that has had a family emergency.  I got a<br/>\nphone call from Barnes and Noble that a book Emily had ordered had come in.<br/>\nI asked her if she wanted to go get it (she said, &quot;But of course!&quot; or maybe<br/>\nit was &quot;duh&quot;? :) )  So the two of us ran up and found that it was the wrong<br/>\nbook so we had to put a reorder in.  We get back home and I remember that it<br/>\nisn&#39;t 3:30 but really 4:30 (Whoever decided that we still need time changes<br/>\nis WRONG! :) ) I have to leave for a PC meeting in half an hour and dinner<br/>\nisn&#39;t made yet.  Emily asks if we can have one of the pork tenderloins and<br/>\nbaby carrots.  She offers to make dinner for which I am eternally thankful<br/>\nthat I shared with my kids the joy of cooking!  I thank her and head out the<br/>\ndoor.  What they did from 5:00 until 11:00 I have NO idea except that when I<br/>\ncame home dinner had been cooked and eaten and the dishes were in the<br/>\ndishwasher!  Keon crashed at 7:30 (Whoever decided that we still need time<br/>\nchanges is WRONG! :) ) and I went to bed.  Since the girls aren&#39;t up I have<br/>\nno idea when they went to bed yet.  Emily spends half her nights on the<br/>\ncomputer chatting with friends and writing at Fanfiction.com Mary Elayne<br/>\nspends her nights watching tv, usually Myth Busters, Unwrapped, or anything<br/>\nshe can find that talk historically about mummies, zombies, pyramids, tombs<br/>\nand other dark things.  She doesn&#39;t like movies with those elements but<br/>\nloves the historical aspect of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll intermixed in that description are long conversations about a plethora<br/>\nof subjects ranging from caterpillers to sonic booms.

To have your fate decided so early<br/>\nseems so limiting to me. I have felt some of this with<br/>\nmy son when he was in public school when he couldn&#39;t<br/>\nget into the gifted program because he&#39;s not good at<br/>\ngrammar or spelling (his lowest scores on the testing<br/>\nthey did). Despite a big description of the gifted<br/>\nprogram as being for creative kids who can think and<br/>\nintegrate concepts quickly, all they really did to<br/>\nassess him was one test and because his low scores on<br/>\nthose two areas put him below the required<br/>\npercentages, that was it. I did pursue it further and<br/>\nfound that maybe richer and more complaining parents<br/>\nthan I might find a way to push into the program. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s when I truly gave up on the public schools. Now<br/>\nhe&#39;s taking classes he chooses at an alt ed ctr where<br/>\nthere are no grades, the teachers are lots of fun, and<br/>\nso far nobody is pushing anything on us that we don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a comment on why it might be good for kids<br/>\nto learn more broadly than specialists later in life.<br/>\nI&#39;m NOT saying this works for all kids or that it&#39;s<br/>\nTHE way to go. Just presenting the idea that I think<br/>\nexposure to more choices and areas of expertise is a<br/>\ngoal of mine for my son and for education in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there are people who know exactly what they<br/>\nwant to do/be at a young age and I&#39;d hardly get in<br/>\ntheir way. However some of us might get fixated in one<br/>\narea because we find it easiest right now, or because<br/>\nit&#39;s all we know we&#39;re good at, or because it&#39;s what<br/>\nwe found first. My experience is that I wish I&#39;d had<br/>\nmore areas of choice made available to me when<br/>\nyounger. <br/>\n<br/>\nTaking on an identity as an &quot;art&quot; type or &quot;college<br/>\nbound&quot; or whatever at an early age can also be<br/>\nlimiting. Getting real experience that you can do more<br/>\nthan one thing gives you a plan B at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I doubt we disagree in practice. I&#39;m sure<br/>\nmost children get experience out of the track they<br/>\nmight be focused on. And I&#39;d hardly push it on a child<br/>\nwho didn&#39;t want it. Just saying that sometimes when<br/>\nyoung you just don&#39;t know all of the choices out there<br/>\nunless someone offers them to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nbest,<br/>\nRyam <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
