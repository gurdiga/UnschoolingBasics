If<br/>\nyou aren&#39;t happy about your finances etc then you make the choice to<br/>\ndo something different to improve your situation or make your<br/>\nsituation more comfortable (move to a smaller house, cut your budget,<br/>\nget a better job etc)    While I do think that when you find yourself<br/>\nin a position fortunate enough to have excess you should share that<br/>\nwith someone less fortunate..it&#39;s how we all keep our &quot;village&quot;<br/>\nhealthy and safe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway all these things in life that the world tries to tell us we<br/>\nmust &quot;learn&quot; or that we must &quot;teach&quot; our children are for the most<br/>\npart crap... all 4 of my kids can read in varying degrees and none of<br/>\nthem were taught to read in a classroom or at home (2 of them read<br/>\nbefore attending K & 1st in a traditional school).   Luckily my kids<br/>\nhave friends who have chosen and been supported in choosing different<br/>\nways to do things... some that don&#39;t have driver&#39;s license even though<br/>\nthey are old enough ... my almost 18 yr old doesn&#39;t have her license<br/>\nbecause she didn&#39;t feel ready...my dad still thinks that I am<br/>\nencouraging her &quot;over cautiousness&quot;  rather than than my view that I<br/>\nam respecting her knowing herself and her own readiness for the<br/>\nlicense.

He&#39;s never been a book person even when he was little - although we<br/>\n&gt; did read to him<br/>\n&gt; it wasn&#39;t one of his favorite things. And most of his favorite books were<br/>\n&gt; hands on books<br/>\n&gt; like pop ups and such. Right now he&#39;s big into World of Warcraft and is<br/>\n&gt; brilliant at the<br/>\n&gt; game. That game has definitely helped him with his reading ability along<br/>\n&gt; with other<br/>\n&gt; things. Occasionally he asks me how to spell words for the game. There&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; plenty of<br/>\n&gt; reading opportunities on the game. Great. However, if he needs to read<br/>\n&gt; something from a<br/>\n&gt; book he will ask me to read it to him.

He has all the pieces to the puzzle individually, but he hasn&#39;t put the puzzle together yet. He will, of that I have no doubt, but he isn&#39;t there yet. I don&#39;t think it is stubborness or being mule-headed that is keeping him from reading, I think he isn&#39;t developmentally ready yet. I don&#39;t think that neurologically all the reading material is there. Because he lives in a reading rich environment where negotiating through and around and with reading material is a part of day to day life I know that he will make those connections. My daughter is 8, she started reading at 6. There is nothing different in their immediate environments. It is all about them and the way their brains work. There are a lot of wonderful stories at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/reading\">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a> about the ways in which reading has played out in unschoolers homes. You can&#39;t force your daughter to read, but you can force her to see herself as being too stupid to be able to read.

My son was having such a hard time<br/>\nreading on my schedule.  He loved being read to, knew his letter and his<br/>\nsounds, but struggled with the words.  The more I encouraged (forced), the<br/>\nmore he resisted.  I finally let up because I was so afraid that reading was<br/>\nbecoming a chore for him and that he would sour on it forever.  About the<br/>\ntime he turned 8, he was into Pokemon.  He traded cards with his friends for<br/>\na year before he decided he wanted to learn to play the game.  To play the<br/>\ngame, he had to read the cards.  That was the trigger for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, it wasn&#39;t until he was 12 before he started reading for pleasure.  He<br/>\ndid that on his own.  Harry Potter helped there.  Now about 15, he will<br/>\nhardly leave the house without a book in his hand.  He especially loves sci<br/>\nfi and fantasy, but right now he&#39;s reading a new book about video game<br/>\nviolence called Grand Theft Childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, May 7, 2008 at 8:03 PM, hscomer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hscomer@...\">hscomer@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   I have a 7 yr old daughter that is being very stubborn about learning<br/>\n&gt; how to read i have not been pushing her but my family is starting to<br/>\n&gt; voice concern about her not reading yet.

The more we unschool the more I see just how much my girls are learning about the world around them BECAUSE THEY WANT TO not because I am pushing them to!!  They are discovering things their schooled friends can&#39;t because they&#39;re in school all day.  My realization is that we should allow children to be children and play and run and discover.  They have no real need to read until they find a need to.
