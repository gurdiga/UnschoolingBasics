The focus of the following issue will be &quot;Teenagers&quot;. We have not decided yet exactly what the article(s) should be about, the authors might have their own ideas. These questions may help you: <br/>\n <br/>\n- what problems do you encounter, if any? what challenges?<br/>\n- what are your main goals/mottos/solutions you target concerning your relationship?<br/>\n- can you see differences between your relationship/your teenagers at home and the traditional approach to puberty/problems with teenagers promoted in the media?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you know someone who has experience with teenagers and might be interested or are you interested yourself? Please write us: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johanna.gundermann@...\">johanna.gundermann@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;unerzogen&quot; is a German magazine publishing since 2007. It issues 4 times a year. We publish articles on unschooling, respectful parenting, democratic education (as our only option for free learning since homeschooling is illegal in Germany) and about the right to choose your own education (which we do not have in Germany). Since our first issue, we have published two articles about unschooling in each issue. Some of the authors you probably know from this list and other blogs and publications: <br/>\n<br/>\n- Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n- Sandra Dodd<br/>\n- Ren Allen<br/>\n- Dayna Martin<br/>\n- Joyce Fetteroll<br/>\n- Kelly Halldorson<br/>\n- Heather Newman<br/>\n- Laura Garbers<br/>\n- Amanda Pearl<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease forward this message to other mailinglists if you can, as well as friends or groups where there might be people who are interested. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\n<br/>\n(Please make sure to use this e-mailadress: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johanna.gundermann@...\">johanna.gundermann@...</a> otherwise I might not get your response!)<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings from Germany,<br/>\nJohanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3758,"nextTopicId":46515}}
