As my husband and I began to prepare for our<br/>\nDec homebirth, we realized how little was out there by way of children&#39;s<br/>\nliterature for our nearly 2yr old who will be there for the big day, so I<br/>\nhave written/illustrated and self-published a children&#39;s book for<br/>\nhomebirthing families and wanted to share the website with you. I am getting<br/>\ngreat feedback from midwives/doulas and families who are finding it to be a<br/>\nfun, informative, useful and very affordable tool for children whose<br/>\nfamilies are planning a homebirth...which is fantastic!<br/>\nwww.homebirthchildrensbook.com<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you well know, the homebirthing community is strong and tight, although<br/>\nrather small. I encourage you to share the link with anyone and everyone who<br/>\nyou think can benefit from it, and I thank you in advance for doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the very best,<br/>\nKelly Mochel<br/>\nwww.homebirthchildrensbook.com<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. In addition to the positive review on my website, ICAN is set to publish<br/>\na positive review in the next issue of the Clarion...which we are thrilled<br/>\nabout!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41908,"nextTopicId":41936}}
