At the moment she&#39;s not <br/>\nwriting much except online with her game (short comments while <br/>\nplaying and usually in &quot;shorthand&quot; because it&#39;s fast paced - &quot;u&quot; for <br/>\nyou etc, she knows it&#39;s not the &quot;correct&quot; way to spell, it&#39;s part of <br/>\nplaying the game).  Last year when she was in school I often scribed <br/>\n(typed) her thoughts for her (also, she was on a 504 <br/>\nplan/accommodations, which allows for scribing) because she couldn&#39;t <br/>\ntype or write them fast enough (she was also evaluated by an <br/>\noccupational therapist and has a few small motor issues, none of <br/>\nwhich matter in the unschooling world, I used that info to try to get <br/>\nher more help in school - HA!).   If I were to &quot;make&quot; her write/type <br/>\nher assignments, it would have squashed what little enjoyment she had <br/>\nleft about learning (she knew she would be homeschooling at the end <br/>\nof the year, and her language arts teacher who assigned these writing <br/>\nassignments was the only one who &quot;understood&quot; her, and my dd knew it, <br/>\nso she felt encouraged when she &quot;did her best&quot;, even if that meant I <br/>\ntyped her paragraphs for her.   They were her words and I think she <br/>\nlearned more about editing, rethinking how to state something etc by <br/>\nus doing that together.   It gave her the freedom to let her creative <br/>\njuices flow by not being bogged down with &quot;writing&quot;).   She learns a <br/>\nlot by talking things through, brainstorming.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you have a fear that your child will never learn how to look <br/>\n </span></blockquote>stuff up unless you force her to do so from an early age, let us put <br/>\nyour mind at rest. It won&#39;t be long until you find that you *don&#39;t <br/>\nhave* the answers to her questions, which is the perfect time to <br/>\nstart saying &quot;Let&#39;s look that up on the internet....at the <br/>\nlibrary....in the encyclopedia.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nStacey, I used to worry about her not being able to &quot;look things up&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;write paragraphs&quot; etc.   I don&#39;t have the wonderful words of <br/>\nwisdom and experience that Robyn and others offer (thank you Robyn!) <br/>\nbut I CAN offer you my perspective, from someone VERY new to <br/>\nunschooling.  When I first started reading about kids being allowed <br/>\nto explore things at their own pace, child led learning (yeah, that <br/>\nwas a hard one at first for me!), I really had to absorb this concept.<br/>\nI hope you are able to get some of those books Kelly suggested - <br/>\nafter reading them, I hope you will be able to understand more (it <br/>\ntakes time).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Any process that puts even a small barrier between the two of you is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>detrimental to building relationships (the core of Unschooling <br/>\npractice). One bad result of not straightforwardly answering her <br/>\nquestions is that she might stop asking you stuff altogether....&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t have a very good relationship with my mother.  I lost her 11 <br/>\nyears ago to cancer and tried to talk to her before she died; it was <br/>\nvery hard for me, because I still felt like I was 12 years old, but I <br/>\nreached out to her, and she shut me out.   I had no closure, no sense <br/>\nof understanding, no feeling of acceptance of the adult I had <br/>\nbecome.  My dd was 2 at the time.  One thing I vowed to myself, even <br/>\nbefore my mother died, was that I would NOT make my dd feel the way <br/>\nmy mother made me feel (I always felt she was ANGRY at me, it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nanything specific, just a feeling that I wasn&#39;t OK to be who I <br/>\nwas, &quot;warts and all&quot;).  Mutual respect is very hard for a lot of <br/>\nadults, they think they have to &quot;be in charge&quot; and &quot;set the rules&quot;, <br/>\nTHEY know better, THEY know what&#39;s best.   Yes, I think there are <br/>\ncertain &quot;rules&quot; about safety that are important, but beyond that, our <br/>\nchildren are human beings too, and the best way for them to learn to <br/>\nrespect others (as well as themselves!) is to treat them with <br/>\nrespect.  The need to know their thoughts and feeling are valid and <br/>\nimportant.  Where else but the safety of our home can they explore <br/>\nthat and feel safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis concept, though &quot;sort of&quot; in the back of my mind, based on what <br/>\nI just said about my relationship with my mother, didn&#39;t fully make <br/>\nsense until I started learning more about unschooling.   With each <br/>\nnew idea, or perhaps reading the way another long time and <br/>\nexperienced unschooler wrote a post, it drew me in.   Last year, <br/>\nwhile my dd was still in school, but I KNEW we would be homeschooling <br/>\nthe following school year (she wanted to try middle school last year, <br/>\nnow she knows what she WON&#39;T be missing!), I started to work on <br/>\nchanging how I related to her.   I relaxed more about homework etc (I <br/>\nnever made an issue about grades, the rest of the issues she had in <br/>\nschool is another story that I won&#39;t go into here).   Yes, she had to <br/>\ndo it, but I helped her work through some things that maybe another <br/>\nparent would have FORCED their child to do all on their own (if they <br/>\ndon&#39;t understand how to write a few paragraphs, how to get started, <br/>\nhow to organize it, even if they&#39;d done it in class, then how can <br/>\nletting them &quot;do it on their own&quot;, struggling and hating that they <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what to do going to HELP them.   It only adds to the loss <br/>\nof love of learning that I saw was happening in my dd).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also reinforced to me that, since I was spending all my free time <br/>\n(I WAS working almost full time during the day) working with her way <br/>\nbeyond the 2 hrs or whatever it was that they said should be the max <br/>\ntime it takes to do homework, I might as well homeschool her!   And <br/>\nbe more effective about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd has been deschooling since June, I&#39;ve let her do what she wants <br/>\n(sleep a long as she wants, she&#39;s not a morning person), play on the <br/>\ncomputer, play video games.   Kids who have always been in school <br/>\nneed this time to heal, they need to get the &quot;schooly&quot; way of <br/>\nlearning out of their heads so that they can then be open to knowing <br/>\nwhat it is they TRULY are interested in.  She&#39;s got the basics down, <br/>\nnow is the time to work towards finding what she loves.  When kids <br/>\npursue their true passions, REAL learning occurs.  It IS really hard <br/>\nto understand until you see it in action.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That may not seem like much of a loss when it&#39;s the relatively <br/>\n </span></blockquote>trivial &quot;how do you spell....?&quot; several times a day, or &quot;what <br/>\ndoes ....mean?&quot; But what about when she is *not* asking you the <br/>\nsometimes alarming questions like &quot;what does STD mean?&quot;, or the deeply<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; profound ones like &quot;what happens when you die?&quot; or &quot;what do you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>believe in?&quot; However possibly the worst result could be that she <br/>\nstops answering your questions to her.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can SEE the healing.  I can feel it.  She can be very anxious, and <br/>\nbeing home has freed her from some of the anxiety that school was <br/>\nproducing in her.  By treating her with respect, listening to her <br/>\ndescribe what she&#39;s doing on her game, really taking the time to <br/>\nlisten and hear the joy it brings her, I &quot;see&quot; what she&#39;s learning <br/>\n(I&#39;m amazed).  It just doesn&#39;t look like &quot;school&quot; and this will be <br/>\nhard to let go of at first.  This is something that, because of the <br/>\njoy, she&#39;s absorbing and assimilating in a way that would never <br/>\nhappen if she were being forced to do, say,  common denominators or <br/>\nwhatever.   There&#39;s no reason kids NEED to learn certain things at <br/>\ncertain ages.  Really!  Think about it as you read more and more <br/>\nabout the philosophy of unschooling.<br/>\nJann</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6586,"nextTopicId":6634}}
