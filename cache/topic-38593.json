I did not wish to start a huge<br/>\ndebate.  I was simply looking for some answers and reassurance that what my<br/>\nson chooses to read is either a) okay and that I need to further work on<br/>\nletting go; or b) that I should  burn every graphic novel he comes into<br/>\ncontact with and force him to read classic novels (that was a joke!!  Please<br/>\ndon&#39;t think I would EVER do something like that!).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been great to listen to everyone&#39;s opinions and I have truly<br/>\nbenefited from this conversation.  I even led my son to the graphic novel<br/>\nsection of the library the other day and let him loose.  As I said before,<br/>\neveryone is at a different place on their journey and everyone has different<br/>\ncomfort zones.  I am being challenged to expand my zone and I appreciate<br/>\nthat.
