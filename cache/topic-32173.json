Do you understand the video games? Do you talk <br/>\nabout the tv shows he watches?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have Netflix? Can you rent movies he would like?

They didn&#39;t have costumes when <br/>\nI was little, but I used a towel.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGet cool pool toys and play with him in the pool.

Go do something. Go out to eat at ethnic restaurants. Go to <br/>\nthe beach or mountains or stream---somewhere different.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrain the dog. Plant a garden.
