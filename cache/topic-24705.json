I went to Target with dh and the kids and my son (15 months<br/>\nbut big for his age) needed to nurse. I nurse in public. I do it to make a<br/>\npoint. Would I be more comfortable somewhere with privacy? Yes. However, if we<br/>\nnursing mamas hide ourselves in fitting rooms, or bathrooms or whatever nursing<br/>\nwill continue to be seen as something that should be hidden. So even though I&#39;m<br/>\nalways afraid that someone will make a comment or say something (even though I<br/>\nknow anything they saw would be b.s.), I nurse out in the open and always look<br/>\npeople in the eye as they walk by. For if they saw I was wavering they would<br/>\nprobably feel compelled to make a rude comment (not everyone of course, but<br/>\nsome people). Well while at Target I nursed my son in a rocking chair that was<br/>\non display in a central part of the store. I looked everyone in the eye while I<br/>\nnursed but this time I could of cared less about what they thought. My painful plugged<br/>\nmilk duct kept me from giving a rats ass. Man, it was a good feeling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere has been a thread on LACTNET, the email list for those<br/>\nwho support breastfeeding, about just this. According to people most knowledgeable<br/>\nin the field, your course of action is the very best both to promote awareness<br/>\nof breastfeeding and to prevent harassment. People who look others in the eye<br/>\nand smile are seldom hassled. It is those who appear diffident and<br/>\nuncomfortable who are vulnerable to those willing to bully. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKendrah, on behalf of nursing mothers and those who endeavor<br/>\nto support them, I thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an alternative for those not quite comfortable with<br/>\nyour course of action that I think is very funny. Hooter Hiders. They provide<br/>\nprivacy while you nurse so that absolutely no one can complain you are showing<br/>\nany skin. They also announce in big, bold, brightly colored patterns that there<br/>\nis something going on behind the curtain. A good many will miss the activity of<br/>\nthe mother who has pulled up her shirt and is covered by her child. No one can<br/>\nmiss a Hooter Hider.  Modesty in NIP and<br/>\nin your face NIP in one neat package.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like the fact that they stand away from the body<br/>\nenough so that mom can look down at baby and that baby can get air.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no financial interest in them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGramma Alice <br/>\nBreastfeeding is the biological norm for infants. It is a relationship that provides food, connection, protection from illness to the baby and stress reducing hormones to the mother.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYahoo! oneSearch: Finally, mobile search <br/>\nthat gives answers, not web links. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.yahoo.com/mobileweb/onesearch?refer=1ONXIC\">http://mobile.yahoo.com/mobileweb/onesearch?refer=1ONXIC</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24717,"nextTopicId":24628}}
