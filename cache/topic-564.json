I have just one precious child at this point, but my situation is unique in that my husband works 3.5 hours away from home all week in Dallas and is home on the weekends.  I&#39;m basically doing a single parent unschooling situation and it&#39;s hard sometimes.  When we were all together all the time, we wanted our daughter to be with us in all circumstances and felt weird when someone would ask us if we wanted them to babysit her while we went out for a birthday celebration or something like that.  Though we&#39;d still want to be together for such occasions, we are feeling more and more like we need some time alone.  It&#39;s difficult when Margaux misses her dad so much during the week and then asking her if we can have some time away from her, which we haven&#39;t done up to now.  We usually just take some time alone in the bedroom, which doesn&#39;t seem to bother her a bit, but there&#39;s more to reconnecting than just the physical.  Sure we could just sit in there and talk, but then that seems like a waste...;o)<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, my husband is driving home and will be here in about an hour.  I have a feeling this weekend won&#39;t be any different than any other--we&#39;ll spend all our time together as a family doing fun things and enjoying our time, but by the end of the weekend, with saying goodbye again for another week, I always wish that we could have, just a few hours.... even now just writing this I feel guilty for thinking it.  Margaux will grow up so fast and then we&#39;ll wish to have her back again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s confusing for me.  Margaux has never had a babysitter.  She has spent some time with unschooling families on the few occasions that were necessary for us to be away, but usually that was not time for us to be together, it was time when we were both running in different directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSigh...<br/>\n<br/>\nIs anyone else out there in this kind of boat?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks...<br/>\n<br/>\nNichole<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, June 11, 2004 3:29 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Some days (not so strange)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;I think it&#39;s strange to NOT want your children with you for special <br/>\n  events.
