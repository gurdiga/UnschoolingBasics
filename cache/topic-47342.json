Those will shift around a bit over time  as your kids get older, <br/>\nneed less sleep, have different interests etc, but there&#39;s a tremendous value to <br/>\nknowing the natural ups and downs of the daily rhythm of your life. It lets you <br/>\ndo a little planning And go with the flow. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can plan relaxing things for &quot;down&quot; times - if your kids get cranky-tired in <br/>\nthe afternoons, for example, you can plan to put in a movie and get everyone <br/>\nsettled for a bit of a rest even if no-one but you actually wants a nap.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, for instance, my daughter tends to get very focused on projects during the <br/>\ncourse of the day - from about mid-morning to lunch and then again in the <br/>\nafternoon, and then she&#39;ll want to change gears and play video games for a <br/>\ncouple hours. So any kind of planning works Around her natural routine. If we&#39;re <br/>\ngoing out, its better to leave before she gets settled in with a project. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGames and puzzles, though, are generally good things to &quot;strew&quot; - have them <br/>\navailable but don&#39;t necessarily plan them. If kids are watching tv, you could <br/>\nget out a puzzle or some craft project to do in the same room and they might <br/>\njoin you, but don&#39;t make a big deal. I find simple house cleaning does a lot to <br/>\nfreshen things up and bring attention to toys and games which have gotten lost <br/>\nin the shuffle (which probably says something about my house-keeping!) so I <br/>\ndon&#39;t really have to say &quot;oh, let&#39;s try this&quot; - its more like &quot;hey, I forgot we <br/>\nhad one of these!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, the harder thing about unschooling is that kids want to learn about <br/>\nthings at the Darnedest times! Right when you&#39;re drifting off to sleep, someone <br/>\nwants to know what plutonium is, or where butterflies go when they migrate, or <br/>\nhow Godzilla got to be so big - and there you are, totally unprepared and the <br/>\nkids want to learn some really cool. All the planning in the world won&#39;t give <br/>\nyou that!

Those will shift around a bit over time  as your kids get older, need less sleep, have different interests etc, but there&#39;s a tremendous value to knowing the natural ups and downs of the daily rhythm of your life. It lets you do a little planning And go with the flow. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can plan relaxing things for &quot;down&quot; times - if your kids get cranky-tired in the afternoons, for example, you can plan to put in a movie and get everyone settled for a bit of a rest even if no-one but you actually wants a nap.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, for instance, my daughter tends to get very focused on projects during the course of the day - from about mid-morning to lunch and then again in the afternoon, and then she&#39;ll want to change gears and play video games for a couple hours. So any kind of planning works Around her natural routine. If we&#39;re going out, its better to leave before she gets settled in with a project. <br/>\n<br/>\nGames and puzzles, though, are generally good things to &quot;strew&quot; - have them available but don&#39;t necessarily plan them. If kids are watching tv, you could get out a puzzle or some craft project to do in the same room and they might join you, but don&#39;t make a big deal. I find simple house cleaning does a lot to freshen things up and bring attention to toys and games which have gotten lost in the shuffle (which probably says something about my house-keeping!) so I don&#39;t really have to say &quot;oh, let&#39;s try this&quot; - its more like &quot;hey, I forgot we had one of these!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, the harder thing about unschooling is that kids want to learn about things at the Darnedest times! Right when you&#39;re drifting off to sleep, someone wants to know what plutonium is, or where butterflies go when they migrate, or how Godzilla got to be so big - and there you are, totally unprepared and the kids want to learn some really cool. All the planning in the world won&#39;t give you that!
