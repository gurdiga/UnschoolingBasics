You can <br/>\n*know* that some foods are &quot;good&quot; and some are &quot;bad&#39;---but it&#39;s the way <br/>\nyour ideas are forced onto someone else.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI totally agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If your kids know how you feel (and even think so too), but chose <br/>\nanother path, what will be your reaction?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nThat is the hard part.  Like in any situation where I might perceive my children were endangering themselves, I would discuss it with them.  There is a fine line, though, between discussion and shame or judgment.  Once they know I prefer it another way, they know (and perhaps that would lead to them feeling guilt or shame though I would never want them to).  So far, although my daughter and I have discussed health and nutrition, she seems to feel no guilt when she does have something that I wouldn&#39;t consider healthy, and I work hard not to lay any on her.  I do worry that as she gets older, she might internalize more of my feelings in a negative way -- and I wouldn&#39;t want that to happen.  Still, I don&#39;t want to lie to my children or pretend I&#39;m not concerned if I am.<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;And a beer and a cigarette AND McNuggets and a Coke enjoyed in *peace* are better---emotionall y. spiritually, psychologically, physically-- -than tofu and a salad eaten in shame or under duress.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t agree here, HOWEVER, I would also hope my children never feel shame or under duress about anything, especially food.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAgain, how do you prevent them from feeling shame when they often want to please their parents, even if it isn&#39;t really what they want to do?  My concern is that once they KNOW how I feel, they might feel shameful, etc., even though that isn&#39;t my intention.  KWIM?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You may present your ideas so rationally and so passionately that your <br/>\nkids latch on and never let you of your ideas on food. BUT what if they <br/>\ndon&#39;t? Now or in the future? You can&#39;t control what they eat forever. <br/>\nIf they choose to be McEaters, how will that effect you?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nJust like it will affect me if they become smokers (just for example).  I&#39;d feel sad.  I wouldn&#39;t try to control it.  I wouldn&#39;t love them any less or treat them any differently.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kid&#39;s in prison.
