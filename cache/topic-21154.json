How to get him to wear glasses, is sorta putting the horse<br/>\nbefore the cart, as it were. Creating opportunities for him to become<br/>\nfamiliar and comfortable with the eye exam environment, people and<br/>\nprocedures would be my first steps. I wouldn&#39;t assume that your son<br/>\n*not* reading the last 5 lines on the chart concludes that he *can&#39;t*<br/>\nread them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother variable is that many food chemicals can interfere with our<br/>\nability to focus and participate in something so tedious and boring as<br/>\nreading letters on and on and on for no seeming purpose. Helping him<br/>\nto understand the variables involved in the assessment. And observe if<br/>\nyour real life observations concur that your son can not clearly<br/>\nvisualize different data at varying distances in a manner that meets<br/>\nhis needs. Basically, I&#39;d also discuss your *son&#39;* observations about<br/>\nhis ability to see clearly. Does he feel frustrated that he needs to<br/>\nget close to items or far from them to see clearly? He is at an age<br/>\nwhere he is probably able to be that self-aware, if you observe some<br/>\nvisual issue out of the ordinary. <br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, my friend posted this fascinating note elsewhere, and as<br/>\na life-long wearer of glasses, the concepts are intriguing to consider:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; (it is an excerpt from Chinaberry book reviews)<br/>\n<br/>\nTAKE OFF YOUR GLASSES AND SEE<br/>\nA Mind/Body Approach to Expanding Your Eyesight and Insight<br/>\nJacob Liberman , O.D., Ph.D.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day I astonished the people around me as I strung seed beads<br/>\nin dim light without glasses (I am 54), and I immediately thought of<br/>\nthis book. Until thirteen years ago I too had felt completely helpless<br/>\nwithout my glasses, which I had worn since I was ten years old.<br/>\nLiberman had not yet written this book, so the book that turned me<br/>\naround then was by Dr. William Bates, written in the 1920&#39;s. Bates is<br/>\nthe grandfather of a slew of books, mostly written in the 1980&#39;s and<br/>\n1990&#39;s, about improving vision without glasses. I set about to read<br/>\nthem all. <br/>\n<br/>\nTAKE OFF YOUR GLASSES AND SEE by Jacob Liberman was the last in a long<br/>\nseries and my favorite. Liberman actually started out as an<br/>\noptometrist, but early on in his practice he couldn&#39;t help wondering,<br/>\n&quot;Why do the eyes appear to be the only part of the physical body that<br/>\nis not self-healing?&quot; Why indeed?! It is as if, as he says, we went to<br/>\na doctor with a broken arm and were told &quot;no problem, I will fit you<br/>\nwith this brace to wear for the rest of your life.&quot; I liked Liberman<br/>\nthe best because he not only gave a description of the very exercises<br/>\n(he calls them meditations) that I had been using to improve my<br/>\nvision, but he brought in the &quot;mind/body&quot; connection - it is not just<br/>\nabout improving your acuity at reading letters on a chart twenty feet<br/>\naway! <br/>\n<br/>\nMy own example of this is when I tried his idea of &quot;open focus.&quot; He<br/>\nwarned what might happen emotionally, but I thought because I had been<br/>\ndoing the other exercises for so long I was beyond that point. I<br/>\nremember standing in my kitchen, after a few days of open focus, and<br/>\nfeeling an emotional blast heading straight at me like an oncoming<br/>\nfreight train. Two hours and many tears later, it was as if I had<br/>\nreleased a great tightness and grief which never came back, though I<br/>\nadmit I was somewhat relieved when I figured out where it had come<br/>\nfrom-those few days of open focus. He also has some wonderful<br/>\nexercises to release your ability to learn (he himself found reading<br/>\nvery difficult) as well as to see clearly (they go hand in hand). I<br/>\ntried them out - they were both fun and amazing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis book is not only for those &quot;needing&quot; glasses already but for<br/>\nthose who would like to know how to keep the excellent vision they<br/>\nhave, those who would like to help keep their children out of glasses,<br/>\nand those who as teachers would like to stem the tide of vision<br/>\nproblems in their classrooms (which, to mix metaphors, is of epidemic<br/>\nproportions). I would love to see the information in this book become<br/>\ncommon knowledge.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes, Pat</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":197731387,"authorName":"Marieke Willis","from":"Marieke Willis &lt;luuknam@...&gt;","profile":"luuknam","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] unschooling glasses?","postDate":"1170452183","msgId":21174,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDcwMjAyMjEzNjIzLjMzNjk2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzMDA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ3Y2Q5MGUyMDcwMjAyMDM0MWkyODQxMzY4YnhlMTIxOGEzZDE1NTdkMzFlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21173,"nextInTopic":21177,"prevInTime":21173,"nextInTime":21175,"topicId":21154,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I wore them on and off for about a year, at first I thought<br/>\nthey were kind of cool but that novelty wore off pretty fast and I<br/>\nbegan to wear them less and less until eventually I just stopped. For<br/>\nabout six years I didn&#39;t use glasses at all - it wasn&#39;t until age 12<br/>\nor so that *I* felt the need for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil that point I was able to read and see okay, I just sat close to<br/>\nthe tv or held the book against my face, lol, but to me that was<br/>\nbetter than wearing glasses. When I was 12 I began to notice a big<br/>\ndifference in my eyesight - I&#39;ve heard puberty can cause this - and so<br/>\nI voluntarily got glasses. At 15 I switched to contacts, it was almost<br/>\nlike a unveiling of my blossoming teenager self, a &quot;coming of age&quot;<br/>\nsort of thing, to take the glasses off.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I don&#39;t know how not wearing glasses for all those years affected<br/>\nmy eye development. Maybe it hurt, or maybe my eyesight would have<br/>\ncontinued to get poorer no matter what (my parents, grandparents,<br/>\naunts, and sister have the same issue, so I think it&#39;s genetic). This<br/>\nis something you&#39;ll want to get a unbiased opinion on, to see if<br/>\nwearing or not wearing will affect his eyesight in any substantial<br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, most eye doctors will automatically expect him to wear them<br/>\nif he has poor eyesight, so you might have to phrase your question a<br/>\nfew different ways before they;ll finally hedge out an answer to what<br/>\nyou&#39;re really asking (because they&#39;ll likely be of the opinion that<br/>\nnot wearing glasses just isn&#39;t an option).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he chooses not to wear glasses, just keep an eye on him for<br/>\nheadaches or other signs that he is experiencing eyestrain. At that<br/>\npoint I would revisit the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] unschooling glasses?","postDate":"1170410485","msgId":21159,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVDMUVERUEwLTZDMjEtNDIxNy1BNUFBLTk1OTgyMENENDJCNUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM1NTI0Mi41ODE2Mi5xbUB3ZWI2MDMyMi5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDM1NTI0Mi41ODE2Mi5xbUB3ZWI2MDMyMi5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":21154,"nextInTopic":21161,"prevInTime":21158,"nextInTime":21160,"topicId":21154,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

After 2 lost pairs, I<br/>\ntalked with him about seeing a holistic eye doctor, that uses exercises<br/>\nand other stuff to correct the problem instead of glasses.  He was<br/>\nwilling to go, and this doctor (really, really nice!)  explained to HIM<br/>\nwhy he needs glasses, what are his eye &quot;problems&quot; etc...

I&#39;d like to just get the glasses and suggest he try them frequently without constantly nagging him, but I guess I&#39;m a little leary -- concerned he&#39;ll just refuse and not ever learn how much easier it is to see with them unless we insist he wear them.
