In my experience little kids mostly spend time with the other little kids their moms find community with, and what they &quot;do&quot; together is all so little-kid centered (which I found annoying and limiting) and less interesting than my own little kids were doing non-age-restricted, interest-based stuff with us. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd realistically, finding any group of little kids who will remain close friends while they each learn and grow and change and discover their own way in the world, could happen but is unlikely. And cannot be mapped or charted. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy unschooled kids found their closest community in musical theatre, singing and dancing stories. So it turned out their shared community was mainly adults and mentors, not other kids, and they are the most lifelong-learning oriented folks we could have handpicked by scouring the earth. So my children now 21 and almost 16 have indeed grown up with these (still learning but already grown) people. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nBut since you are relocating geographically as well, you might lean a little toward &quot;college towns&quot; because for their size, they do tend to offer a wide range of community learning opportunities and potential groups sharing different passions and learning together. I&#39;ve written about living and learning in (two different southern) college towns and the discussion following brings up a few others:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2008/05/13/living-in-a-college-town/\">http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2008/05/13/living-in-a-college-town/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/jjs-beloved-gator-nation-makes-nyt-for-education-culture-history/\">http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/jjs-beloved-gator-nation-makes-nyt-for-education-culture-history/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2008/12/15/next-chapter-in-which-favorite-daughter-received-her-own-first-passport/\">http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2008/12/15/next-chapter-in-which-favorite-daughter-received-her-own-first-passport/</a><br/>\n&quot;I&#39;d say it&#39;s not holiday OR work, though I hadn&#39;t thought about it until you asked. It&#39;s more like the way she&#39;s always learned, as an unschooler  she meets people and gets involved in what appeals to her, like reading and writing, dancing and musical theatre. Then those people in those worlds connect to other people and overlapping interests, and she goes (how did the Narnia Chronicles put it?) &#39;higher up and deeper in!&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess you could say it&#39;s a Power of Story trip? The Europe Adventure seems to have germinated in dance (Ireland) and been watered well by song and poetry and literature. The fertilizer then, seems to have been various college honors courses in religion and the humanities. She just got around to formal foreign language study (French) and if it hadn&#39;t been for her fluent friend and meeting her family, I&#39;m not sure she ever would have seen that as something worth her time and effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe agenda they&#39;re planning (all by themselves) is very personal and offbeat, and the different arrangements they&#39;re considering and what criteria they&#39;re using to choose, are just fascinating to hear about.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I want a group of kids for<br/>\n&gt; my own children to grow up with who share the same value that life is a learning experience.
