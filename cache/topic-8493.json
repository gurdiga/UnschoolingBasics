Hugging when one of us was mean to the other. Hugs became punishment, and it got my brother and I to the point were we couldn&#39;t touch each other because it was all wrapped up in being bad and doing something wrong. 25 years later and a LOT of talking and working thru things we are on our way to a better relationship.(It also changed the way I viewed touch in many other relationships)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I would never want to do this to my boys. They choose to hug one another when they want or need to. I wouldn&#39;t want to change that.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Avery(4yrs) can not handle people touching him without his permission or him initionating the contact. To force him to hug Jaiden(7) and appologize before he ready would be horrible and meaningless to him.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;m sorry if any of this sounds/comes across as harsh but this hit very close to home.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ~Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, Hobbes, some days even my lucky rocketship underpants don&#39;t help.&quot;<br/>\n-Calvin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

So  <br/>\neven if your technique cuts back the fighting, the something else  <br/>\nthat triggers the fighting is still there working on the kids. That  <br/>\nhasn&#39;t gone away.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look at it from their point of view, if their goal is to get  <br/>\nsomething, or drive a sibling away to play alone, you haven&#39;t helped  <br/>\nthem. You&#39;ve just put road block in front of the tactic they&#39;re  <br/>\nusing. So the option they&#39;re left with is to find a different, more  <br/>\nsubtle method. (People have told of the quite mean things their  <br/>\nsiblings did to them when they were kids that their mothers never  <br/>\nknew about.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKids need to feel that we&#39;re their advocate, that we&#39;re on their  <br/>\nside. If we assume they&#39;re doing the best they can with the  <br/>\nknowledge, outlook and skills they have and our objective is to help  <br/>\nthem be peaceful and happy, then punishing them for not using better  <br/>\nskills isn&#39;t going to help them get better at handling situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps one way of looking at it is that it&#39;s your job to make them  <br/>\nfeel safe and happy in their own home. So, the first step is to make  <br/>\nthem safe and help them be happy, like separating them, calling one  <br/>\naway to do something fun with you, get a snack if it seems the  <br/>\nirritability might be hunger. If it&#39;s a negotiation problem, then  <br/>\ntalking individually to them about better choices they can make.  <br/>\nSandra Dodd has some good writing on fighting that others have posted  <br/>\nlinks to.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Siblings and fighting","postDate":"1135272742","msgId":8499,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRvZW52NitkM2VyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8497,"nextInTopic":8506,"prevInTime":8498,"nextInTime":8500,"topicId":8493,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I make them tell me and the sibling they are picking on 4 NICe things about that person.
