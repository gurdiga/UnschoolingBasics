I was well aware of when he wasn&#39;t sleepy, particularly around &quot;Bedtime&quot; but I think I rolled the two together.  I looked for sleepiness around bedtime, instead of just being aware of him, without my agenda. <br/>\n<br/>\n***Why is it the last drink?

Do<br/>\nyou look for clues to his tiredness or is it done at an arbitrary time?<br/>\n<br/>\nI see your point.  We usually initiate it...again at &quot;bedtime&quot; (I am seeing the pattern here...) but he does enjoy brushing teeth with us and for us, he doesn&#39;t even mind getting into bed & reading & singing, but when the sleepy song hits, he gets immediately annoyed.  which brings me to your concluding response...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Could you ask him if he is ready for the special sleepy song?

No wonder he hates the song now.  I don&#39;t blame him. Thanks for helping me shift my thinking about this. <br/>\n<br/>\nSleep is a sensitive issue in our family.  My husband goes to bed fairly early as he is up for work mos days by 5am and I have never in my adult life been able to nap.  Even when my son was an infant and was awake every 2 hours, I still didn&#39;t nap, initially I tried, but to no avail (Although, my body handled it without the naps, at this stage of my son&#39;s development, he is a busy little guy.  I love every minute of it, but I am a better mother when I am rested.)  I need to figure out how to respect my sons autonomy in regards to this issue, while still getting enough rest.

My<br/>\nThinking was that perhaps if he was able to choose when he falls asleep, he<br/>\nwould have no reason to resent it. I tried for 2 weeks and my husband and I<br/>\nwere EXHAUSTED (But I hope we didn&#39;t give up to soon.) He was staying up<br/>\ninto the wee hours of the morning, naps were obviously thrown off as well. I<br/>\njust didn&#39;t see a positive outcome on the horizon. We were all just<br/>\ncompletely wiped out (well, our son wasn&#39;t. He was quite happy at 3 in the<br/>\nmorning watching his favorite video, Planet Earth, asking me to name and<br/>\nsign all the animals that would come on the screen.

I think that was the last night of self<br/>\nregulating sleep.)<br/>\n<br/>\n***I tend to steer clear of thinking of my child rearing as a experiment. It<br/>\nmight help for you to gently allow him more and more freedom in terms of his<br/>\ncontrolling his sleep schedule. He may not have the same rhythm as you. And<br/>\na gentle flow towards more freedom gives you both time to adjust. He seems<br/>\nto be feeling usurped. Your need for him to sleep is trumping his<br/>\ndesire/need to stay awake or at least control his sleep rhythms.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like you were doing ok. Why the sudden change? What were your<br/>\nthoughts when you were having a fun time hanging out with sweet baby at 3<br/>\nam? Was it because you were tired or because you thought he &quot;ought&quot; to be in<br/>\nbed?<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nI have three children, my youngest is 19 months. We have a loose routine. We<br/>\nplay and do our thing until we notice that she is getting tired. Then my dh<br/>\ntakes responsibility of the older kids and I take the baby. She will<br/>\ngenerally take my hand and led me to the stairs and say &quot;nur&quot; and we got lay<br/>\ndown. I will sing or talk to her while she falls asleep. If she nurses and<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t fall asleep I will ask her if she wasn&#39;t a back run or to read or to<br/>\nget up. Then we do that. That&#39;s about all. Usually we do bath and teeth at<br/>\nsome point after the sun goes down. Sometime we skip it if she is really<br/>\ntired. We do book reading and singing at other times so it isn&#39;t something<br/>\nwe generally do at sleep time. My oldest two fell asleep much the same way.<br/>\nThey are 12 and 6. The 6 still sleeps with us and will just say his tired<br/>\nand ask for what he wants. If we notice that someone seems tired we mention<br/>\nit. My oldest needs music or an audio book to fall asleep.

He so loves being a part of it all and it is just beautiful to watch him cuddle up next to daddy as he drifts off.  He goes to work so early in the morning we are asleep before he leaves.  He works so hard, I feel like I want him to share in the joys of bedtime together.  That being said, I realize now, that it has been at the expense of my son&#39;s autonomy.

Sometimes people just want their feelings  <br/>\nacknowledged. It might seem like too much thought for a 21 month old  <br/>\nbut he might understand &quot;It&#39;s too bad humans need to sleep!

Our 10 yr old daughter still occasionally pops in bed with me but for the most part has decided that her bedroom is much more comfortable. Our 4 yr old alternates where he sleeps. Usually where he passes out (he literally just keeps going until his body says stop, he will lay down to &quot;take a rest&quot; and be asleep within minutes), either the living room on the sleep sofa watching a show or curled up with mommy. Daddy works night shift now so except for 2 nights a week it is just mommy. My son was born a night owl and naps? That isn&#39;t necessarily in his vocabulary and really never has been. However, I have noticed that on days where he has expended most of his energy he settles down a lot sooner than on days where he hasn&#39;t felt like doing much of anything. The best advice I can give is something my mother in law told me when my daughter was born. Sleep when the baby sleeps, it may<br/>\n not be convenient for anyone else but if mommy doesn&#39;t take care to get rest too then there are real problems. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your husband needs to be up early then maybe being in another room so he can get some sleep while you and your son read and sing and play. It might be easier to let him get that extra energy out that way and then carry him to bed. You can also simply explain that daddy needs to get some rest. Trying to have him sleep in his own bed before he is ready will just make everyone miserable. A crib mattress feels very different than a regular mattress, which is what he is used to. Perhaps a big boy bed for him to get used to so that when he is ready to make the change over it doesn&#39;t feel weird to him. By weird you know that feeling you get sleeping some place other than your own bed, or at least I get that, kids get it too. It just doesn&#39;t feel right. Also, a little lavender oil in the bath water before bed helps to relax. We also do stories and songs and then we turn down the lights and sometimes turn them off, snuggle up close, and we make up stories and<br/>\n take make believe adventures, I can&#39;t count how many nights my son has fallen asleep in the middle of an adventure. His falling asleep in the living room is a recent thing, though usually he wakes up and wanders in and curls up next to mommy to finish out the night. We might have one more drink of chocolate milk at that point, sometimes we don&#39;t. He still likes his milk warm even though he doesn&#39;t want mommy milk anymore. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps, sorry for rambling I am very tired tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/\">http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/\">http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder, he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement and mystery of the world we live in.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel Carson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: universalgenre &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:universalgenre@...\">universalgenre@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, April 26, 2009 5:53:46 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Bedtime~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi everybody~<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been with you all for a few months now, reading, learning, unlearning.  Thank you for all your contributions.  I am really in awe of those who followed this path before any of these such resources were available.  I am humbled and thankful to all the parents for sharing their hard earned wisdom on this front.  For those of us beginning this new chapter in our journeys, you all are a priceless blessing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I ask for your thoughts on bedtime.  My son is 21 months old and bedtime is something he does not want to do.  I went through the archives and searched for old wisdom on this that might help, but most was geared towards older children and I wasn&#39;t certain how applicable many of those suggestions would be for a 21 month old. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is some background: we&#39;ve been co-sleeping from the very beginning with a very brief intermission ( 2 weeks actually) of letting him fall asleep in our bed then transferring him to the crib, where after sleeping a few hours unaware, he would quietly wake up, stand to his feet, and remind me that he doesn&#39;t belong there.  I&#39;d pick him up and he&#39;d immediately fall back to sleep in our bed.  There was never any crying, just a gentle reminder on his part of where he should be sleeping.  It took a couple of weeks for us to get a clue.  After being awakened from a deep sleep every night for 2 weeks, we came around and we are now happily all together, at least once sleep commences. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a bedtime ritual.  It didn&#39;t start off this way, but it evolved into what it is over time.  He gets his last drink of milk before morning, we all go to brush our teeth and hop in bed for about 3-6 books and couple of songs.  All of which he enjoys.  The coup de gras of our evening, our homemade sleepy time song which he used to love, but now often yields whining and tears and him trying to crawl out of bed for about 10 minutes before he finally settles in and goes to sleep.  (If I don&#39;t sing the song, he just keeps saying &quot;more, MORE&quot;  with the other songs I am singing and ends up staying awake for an hour or more singing them with me.  When he hears the bedtime song, he knows it is time to settle in.)I am looking for ideas to help him have a better experience of falling asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son was about 17 months, I tried allowing him to fall asleep at his leisure, an experiment to see if at this age, he could self regulate.  My Thinking was that perhaps if he was able to choose when he falls asleep, he would have no reason to resent it.  I tried for 2 weeks and my husband and I were EXHAUSTED (But I hope we didn&#39;t give up to soon.) He was staying up into the wee hours of the morning, naps were obviously thrown off as well.  I just didn&#39;t see a positive outcome on the horizon.  We were all just completely wiped out (well, our son wasn&#39;t. He was quite happy at 3 in the morning watching his favorite video, Planet Earth, asking me to name and sign all the animals that would come on the screen.  At one point I think I began to laugh maniacally and he started laughing with me.  Both of us...laughing while I continue to shout out the animals...haa haa..kangaroo. ..haa haa...Caribou!  I think that was the last night of self regulating<br/>\n sleep.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, I am completely open to trying it again, IF you AMAZING trail blazers out there have had success with it at or around his age.  I can deal with the lack of sleep if I know that there is a strong possibility that we will reach the promised land. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour thoughts are eagerly anticipated and appreciated. ..<br/>\n<br/>\nGenesis mom to Sage (21 mo)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":219431926,"authorName":"universalgenre","from":"&quot;universalgenre&quot; &lt;universalgenre@...&gt;","profile":"universalgenre","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Bedtime~","postDate":"1240782826","msgId":39821,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd0Mmw1YSs4dGRiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39823,"prevInTime":39820,"nextInTime":39822,"topicId":39821,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everybody~ I ve been with you all for a few months now, reading, learning, unlearning.
