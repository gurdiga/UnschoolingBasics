I&#39;ve known teens raised in controlling homes who got into partying and  drugs and sex as soon as they left home.  I&#39;ve also been a teen  who didn&#39;t have much for rules or punishments, and I went hog-wild just  as bad as they did, and at an earlier age.  The one thing I did  realize, though, was that my mom wasn&#39;t around and wasn&#39;t very involved  with my life in my teen years.  I was just kind of set free at 10  - left to make sure I got my homework done and make meals for myself  and two younger bros and cleaning the house and such.  My mom did  the best she could as a single mom, going to school full-time and  working as much as she could when she wasn&#39;t at school.  I&#39;m not  saying this to whine, but to make the point that I think it&#39;s the  amount of involvement, communication, and interest in teens&#39; lives,  along with giving them the freedom to do & choose for<br/>\n themselves,  that is the key to keeping kids out of trouble when they leave home or  are without parental supervision.  I could always be wrong or  playing the &quot;what if?&quot; game with my childhood, but this is the theory  floating in my head lately.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Anastasia<br/>\n<br/>\nLesa McMahon-Lowe &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lesajm@...\">lesajm@...</a>&gt; wrote:          Pam,<br/>\n   <br/>\n  That&#39;s a great story.
