For example, there have been times when we&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt;needed to stand and wait for something in a space where toys and <br/>\n&gt;games and running are just not doable (such as waiting in the <br/>\n&gt;funeral home lobby before FIL&#39;s funeral this past March). We&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt;developed (over time) a repertoire of physical but quiet and low key <br/>\n&gt;activities that let DS burn some of his abundant energy without <br/>\n&gt;disturbing others - in that case, for example, we found an area with <br/>\n&gt;a little space around it (3 ft radius roughly) and he takes my hand <br/>\n&gt;and swings around me in a circle, switching hand to hand as one arm <br/>\n&gt;reaches its limit like a monkey swinging tree to tree. He got energy <br/>\n&gt;out, I was able to acknowledge people going past and chat a little <br/>\n&gt;bit, DH was able to focus on his mom and other family members (as <br/>\n&gt;well as having space for his own self) and I was able to keep an eye <br/>\n&gt;out to DH for when he needed us. It really helped also to brief DS <br/>\n&gt;on what to expect (what he&#39;d see, hear, maybe smell since there&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;often a bit of air freshener type scent in funeral homes, perhaps <br/>\n&gt;feel emotionally, and so on). Lots of preparation and lots of <br/>\n&gt;discussion in the days afterward. Things like the old isometric <br/>\n&gt;exercises can be helpful - sitting next to each other and placing <br/>\n&gt;palm against palm (his against mine) and pushing/resisting is quiet <br/>\n&gt;but uses some big muscles which can help when he&#39;s getting restless. <br/>\n&gt;And, sometimes, I&#39;ll excuse <br/>\n&gt;myself and DS and I will go to another room (bathroom if nowhere <br/>\n </span></blockquote>else <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is available) so that we can talk without disturbing whatever is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>going <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; on, touch base, work on what is happening, what he needs, what I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>need, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; etc). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a partnership.

LOL.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah - slightly different there (Because the situation at someone else&#39;s <br/>\nhouse is different than at home). Sounds like SHE needs more tools at <br/>\nhand when visiting. A big key is to try to foresee the situation and <br/>\ncut the &quot;problem behaviors&quot; off at the pass so to speak. For example, <br/>\nwhen we were going to visit my 91 yr old aunt at her little senior <br/>\nhousing apartment (not a lot of space, mostly grownups sitting and <br/>\ntalking, etc) we made sure to bring DS&#39; sketchpad, pens, Nintendo DS <br/>\nwith games and headphones and charger, etc. As it turned out, my aunt <br/>\nhad just adopted a kitten and DS had a great time playing with a <br/>\nfishing-pole like cat toy with a feather on the end - he&#39;d dangle it <br/>\nand the kitten would chase it and jump for it and they played for a <br/>\ngood half hour at a clip with that. In the process, he was able to <br/>\nconnect with my aunt over the kitten which helped him feel more <br/>\ncomfortable in that space and she thinks he&#39;s a wonderfully amazing kid <br/>\n(he actually *talked* to her directly, instead of doing the &#39;that&#39;s an <br/>\nOLD person, avoid avoid avoid thing - I did have to &#39;interpret&#39; on <br/>\noccasion because of her hearing loss). When we&#39;re in church, he has his <br/>\nbag o&#39; stuff (sketchpad, DS with headphones, snacks, water bottle, misc <br/>\nquiet bits - a recent inclusion was a book of puns!lol). <br/>\n<br/>\nTaking a child (or any person really) into a situation that (a) they <br/>\nhave no control over and (b) they have no connection to (such as a 4 yr <br/>\nold at Aunt Betsy&#39;s totally not child-safe one bedroom apartment) for 3 <br/>\nhours of grown up chatting is asking for difficulties in most cases <br/>\nUNLESS you account for the situation, discuss it together as partners, <br/>\nand provide tools for dealing with it (quiet toys, a favorite video or <br/>\ntwo, a snack if there&#39;s not going to be one handy, etc) Plus, you&#39;d <br/>\nalso want to be sure to touch base regularly, excuse yourself during a <br/>\nlull in conversation and see how things are going, evaluate whether you <br/>\nmight need to cut things shorter than planned, etc. Simply snatching up <br/>\na child away from their familiar territory and plopping them down in <br/>\nsome strange place with no resources at all, they&#39;re going to do <br/>\nwhatever they need to do to keep occupied - which might mean crawling <br/>\naround on the floor like a puppy and barking at people. An ounce of <br/>\nprevention is worth a pound of cure - rather than looking for &#39;better <br/>\ndiscipline/punishment&#39; methods, work as your child&#39;s partner to find <br/>\nways to avoid or minimize the difficulties of the situation. For <br/>\nexample, there have been times when we&#39;ve needed to stand and wait for <br/>\nsomething in a space where toys and games and running are just not <br/>\ndoable (such as waiting in the funeral home lobby before FIL&#39;s funeral <br/>\nthis past March). We&#39;ve developed (over time) a repertoire of physical <br/>\nbut quiet and low key activities that let DS burn some of his abundant <br/>\nenergy without disturbing others - in that case, for example, we found <br/>\nan area with a little space around it (3 ft radius roughly) and he <br/>\ntakes my hand and swings around me in a circle, switching hand to hand <br/>\nas one arm reaches its limit like a monkey swinging tree to tree. He <br/>\ngot energy out, I was able to acknowledge people going past and chat a <br/>\nlittle bit, DH was able to focus on his mom and other family members <br/>\n(as well as having space for his own self) and I was able to keep an <br/>\neye out to DH for when he needed us. It really helped also to brief DS <br/>\non what to expect (what he&#39;d see, hear, maybe smell since there&#39;s often <br/>\na bit of air freshener type scent in funeral homes, perhaps feel <br/>\nemotionally, and so on). Lots of preparation and lots of discussion in <br/>\nthe days afterward. Things like the old isometric exercises can be <br/>\nhelpful - sitting next to each other and placing palm against palm (his <br/>\nagainst mine) and pushing/resisting is quiet but uses some big muscles <br/>\nwhich can help when he&#39;s getting restless. And, sometimes, I&#39;ll excuse <br/>\nmyself and DS and I will go to another room (bathroom if nowhere else <br/>\nis available) so that we can talk without disturbing whatever is going <br/>\non, touch base, work on what is happening, what he needs, what I need, <br/>\netc). <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a partnership. Knowing that his needs will be considered and <br/>\naddressed as much as possible is sometimes all DS needs to be able to <br/>\nmanage a particular situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: New here, question","postDate":"1213366230","msgId":33762,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcydHY0bStwZTA3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGcyczYzYSsya2ZrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33761,"nextInTopic":33763,"prevInTime":33761,"nextInTime":33763,"topicId":33744,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... wrote: I ll talk about what adventures we re having or what my ...

I&#39;ve always described what we do as &quot;just  <br/>\nfollowing her interests&quot;. And allow people to believe what they will  <br/>\nwith that. One of the benefits of magnet schools was to allow  <br/>\nchildren to follow their interests. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But he still wants our children to be &#39;disciplined&#39; as far as behavior<br/>\n&gt; goes<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What he needs is an unschooling conference so he can see what happens  <br/>\nwith kids who have freedom with the partnership of a parent :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can often train children through various forms of punishment to  <br/>\n*act* right -- eg, &quot;be disciplined&quot; -- but it&#39;s all on the surface.  <br/>\nThe more we train them to behave as we want, the better they get at  <br/>\nhiding who they are and the less we know what&#39;s going on inside.  <br/>\nHaven&#39;t we all met kids who are sweet around adults and terrors when  <br/>\nadults aren&#39;t around? Ask him if he knows kids like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a guarantee that sweet on the outside hides nasty on the  <br/>\ninside, but the big point is that if kids can&#39;t trust that they can  <br/>\nbe themselves around us, *we can&#39;t know*.  If kids continue to be who  <br/>\nthey are around us we can be there to help them find safe and  <br/>\nsocially acceptable ways to get what they&#39;re trying to get.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think too often, like with school, parents see the successes and  <br/>\nassume school is the cause and see the failures and assume the child  <br/>\nor family is at fault. But is that true? Of course most people can&#39;t  <br/>\neven know! For them there is no control group. Unschoolers can see  <br/>\nthat their kids become successes even without school so we *know*  <br/>\nschool isn&#39;t the factor.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust the same with strict parenting. Most parents are aware of strict  <br/>\nparenting and permissive parenting but nothing in between. At least  <br/>\nwith strict parenting, kids have some input and role modeling on what  <br/>\nthey should do, so some do come out right. Permissively parented kids  <br/>\noften lack engagement with their parents so they&#39;re raising themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nMIndful parenting avoids the pitfalls of both. It has both the  <br/>\nengagement and the role modeling without the neglect and without the  <br/>\ncontrol that can make kids fight against what we want for them. At 16  <br/>\nmy daughter is kind and thoughtful and actually enjoys spending time  <br/>\nwith me. Can most parents of 16 yos say that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like he&#39;s afraid. It also sounds like he&#39;s worried what  <br/>\nothers will think. Those are real concerns to him and should be  <br/>\ntreated with the respect you&#39;d give your kids&#39; worries and concerns!  <br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s right, but it does mean it feels real to him and  <br/>\nif you treat his worries as silly he&#39;s not going to feel listened to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, our 4 year old is very much in her own fantasy world- which I am<br/>\n&gt; reminding him is a good thing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You might see if your library has:<br/>\n<br/>\nYour 4 Year Old<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/6y82x3\">http://tinyurl.com/6y82x3</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people have said how accurate the series is for behavior for  <br/>\neach age.

I really agree with all that was said.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I just wanted to say, I don&#39;t use the term unschooling with<br/>\nmy extended family (I come from a long line of educators). And I don&#39;t<br/>\ndiscuss the philosophy of unschooling with anyone who isn&#39;t doing it<br/>\nthemselves. I&#39;ll talk about what adventures we&#39;re having or what my<br/>\nson is involved in right now. That&#39;s the stuff they can relate to. And<br/>\nthey like hearing about our lives. At times I&#39;ve gotten self conscious<br/>\nin some situations where I&#39;m clearly doing my parenting differently<br/>\nthen how I was raised, but..oh well. I had to get over that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had to not use the term unschooling with my partner, too. He didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant the label. And that&#39;s ok. When we do talk about various family<br/>\nstuff--respect for each other, guidance (discipline), what we want our<br/>\nlives to be like with our boy, I still don&#39;t use the word unschooling<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m not trying to fit into a philosophy or label our family;<br/>\nI&#39;m simply trying to be happy and have a happy family.<br/>\njust my $.02<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, gotta run.<br/>\n~~Juillet   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Therese&quot;<br/>\n&lt;theresefranklin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My name is Therese, gentle Christian mama to my two girls, ages 2 and <br/>\n&gt; 4.  I used to teach 2nd grade and then 1st grade for a few years before <br/>\n&gt; my girls were born.  I knew after my experiences teaching that <br/>\n&gt; homeschooling would be ideal, and I don&#39;t really know if I could ever <br/>\n&gt; go back to &#39;teaching&#39; in the way the schools would have me teach. Scary <br/>\n&gt; scary.  <br/>\n&gt; Anyhow, I have done lots and lots of reading, and I agree with <br/>\n&gt; unschooling and can see how it will benefit my children.  As a <br/>\n&gt; Christian, I fully believe that God made them with their own unique <br/>\n&gt; gifts that can be realized when given the freedom to explore them.  The <br/>\n&gt; bible teaches we are free through Christ, and I fully want them to <br/>\n&gt; experience what God has in store for them.  I didn&#39;t want to get into a <br/>\n&gt; religious discussion, but just wanted to let you know where I come from <br/>\n&gt; here.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband however has some major issues about the term &#39;unschooling&#39;, <br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;m working on him.  He doesn&#39;t want us to ever label ourselves <br/>\n&gt; as &#39;unschoolers&#39;.  (Well he doesn&#39;t want me to label myself as VEGAN <br/>\n&gt; either, but thats what I am LOL) mostly because of flack from our <br/>\n&gt; families- who are just coming to terms with our homeschooling as it is, <br/>\n&gt; as well as our AP parenting philosophy (not sending kids to sunday <br/>\n&gt; school, etc) and allowing our children to sleep next to us, etc.  He <br/>\n&gt; agreed with me that grades and testing are useless tools made for the <br/>\n&gt; masses, not our children, (yay!) and he doesn&#39;t think a boxed <br/>\n&gt; curriculum would be beneficial when there is so much to learn in <br/>\n&gt; everyday life. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But he still wants our children to be &#39;disciplined&#39; as far as behavior <br/>\n&gt; goes, and wants me to set up a predictable schedule for the girls and <br/>\n&gt; myself.  I don&#39;t think that a routine would be bad at all, but there is <br/>\n&gt; no way I can be very regimented... I am thinking of printing <br/>\n&gt; a &#39;schedule&#39; and put that on the fridge to pacify him. LOL  <br/>\n&gt; He also wants to make sure she &#39;knows&#39; things that the schools are <br/>\n&gt; teaching- and he thinks that some things have to be learned whether <br/>\n&gt; they like it or not...  not sure how to respond to that.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, our 4 year old is very much in her own fantasy world- which I am <br/>\n&gt; reminding him is a good thing- but he worries about her because every <br/>\n&gt; moment he is home, she is running on all fours as a &#39;pony&#39; or &#39;puppy&#39; <br/>\n&gt; or &#39;rat&#39; (thanks to ratatoulle) and she even does this in public and he <br/>\n&gt; gets embarassed. She also has to sing or shout or ramble on and on <br/>\n&gt; CONSTANTLY and he worries that there is something wrong with that.

Extend the same respect and understanding to him that you do to<br/>\nthe kids. The presumption that he&#39;s doing the best he can with what he<br/>\nknows the same way you presume the kids are doing the best they can in a<br/>\ngiven situation with the tools they have at hand. You model behaviors,<br/>\ndiscuss things non-judgmentally, etc. If he&#39;s willing to read stuff, get<br/>\nshort bits of articles, posts, etc that he can read quickly (bathroom<br/>\nreading LOL). Something like Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child is good<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s set up in short Q&A style bits. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor many years, we didn&#39;t use the term &#39;unschooling&#39; with family<br/>\nmembers. Over time, we made homeschooling and unschooling<br/>\ninterchangeable in our mentions of it. Now we just use unschooling. BUT<br/>\nthey&#39;ve also had time to see that whatever it is we&#39;re doing is really<br/>\ngreat for DS (he&#39;s 10 now, we began unschooling when he was born, he&#39;s<br/>\nnever been schooled institutionally or at home).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as &quot;disciplined&quot;, y&#39;all might want to consider what that term<br/>\nactually means. It doesn&#39;t mean &quot;punished&quot;. A disciple is one who<br/>\nfollows another or who is brought alongside one for training or<br/>\ninstruction. Jesus didn&#39;t &quot;punish&quot; the apostles and other followers when<br/>\nthey just didn&#39;t get it (or did really stupid stuff). He spent more time<br/>\ninstructing them. *HE* went to &quot;time out&quot; of sorts when he needed it -<br/>\ngoing away alone to pray when things got overwhelming - rather than<br/>\nsending them away to &#39;think about what they did&#39;. KWIM? <br/>\n<br/>\nI might want to make some private time sans little ears to sit down in a<br/>\nrelaxed and calm manner and find out what it is he exactly thinks &quot;has<br/>\nto be learned&quot; and why. No rebuttal, just listen to him. Ask questions<br/>\nfor clarification as needed. Ask Why? A lot. Use the time honored<br/>\nrabbinic tradition of answering questions with questions if he flips the<br/>\nquestions around on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour household *already* has a routine of some form - it just might not<br/>\nLOOK like the kind of thing he grew up with. Life itself has patterns<br/>\nand rhythms - that&#39;s the way it was *created* it be. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also want to find ways to communicate with him about what<br/>\nhappens when he&#39;s NOT there. What does she do for the &quot;rest&quot; of the time<br/>\nif all he sees is when she&#39;s being a pony or a puppy or a rodent? He has<br/>\nno idea. Some people set up private password protected blogs so they can<br/>\npost pictures and text for family to see and that is sometimes helpful.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve got cell phones with camera ability and multimedia/texting<br/>\ncapabilities so that when DH (the at home parent) and DS (10) are doing<br/>\nfun stuff, they can send me pictures to my cell phone or to my email<br/>\nhere at work.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
